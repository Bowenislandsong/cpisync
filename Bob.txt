His ways are notthe ways of other people: he is suspicious, distant, and he does notcare to show his hand--unless, of course, there is some pecuniaryadvantage to be gained. He is invariably on the alert for advantagesof that description.His suspicious nature has probably been handed down to him frompreceding generations. When he first set foot in South Africa he wasnaturally chary concerning the native population. He had to dealfirmly with Bushmen, and the latter certainly proved a source ofcontinual trouble. The Boer set himself a difficult task when heundertook to instil fear, obedience, and submission into the hearts ofthese barbarians--a task that could only be faced by men of firmdetermination and unlimited self-confidence.These characteristics have always inspired the Boer, and although hemay often have been the object of derision, it is to his credit thatthe predominant qualities mentioned have enabled him to pull throughthe miry clay. Without these qualities, it is patent that the littleband which landed at the Cape long years ago would have succumbedbefore the conflicting forces which then existed. And as succeedingyears passed on, and the sun still shone upon the heads of thepioneers, it is worthy to note that, despite the difficulties whichcontinually presented themselves, the little band multiplied,prospered, and evolved an ensample not too mean to contemplate.The Boer cannot be charged with any incapacity where the meretreatment of natives is concerned; he can manage that businessperfectly. In the first place, he does not make the too common mistakeof allowing the black populace to insert the thin end of the wedge.This is a mistake too often fraught with serious results, and the Boerknows it. A native, no matter if he be Swazi, Zulu, Basuto, or anyother nationality, will always take advantage where such is offered,and he will follow it up with enough persistence to warrant ultimatesuccess. In Natal, at the present time, this mistake is very apparent,and, in consequence, one very seldom encounters a native who iscontent to attire himself in any other manner than that adopted by hismaster. He demands decent clothing, and, if possible, it must be newand fashionable. I have known cases where a 'boy' has been presentedwith a respectable suit of clothes a little too small for him, and itis unnecessary to add that he disposed of that suit. People who havehitherto allowed their children to put their pennies in the SundaySchool Mission box, will perhaps hesitate to continue supporting the'poor, down-trodden native' when they learn that he is so fastidious,and perhaps, after all, their spare coppers might be assigned to amore deserving cause.The Boer does not treat his black servants in any such fashion--heknows better. He puts them on a sound footing to begin with, and heleads them to understand that they must remain there.This method of treatment where the natives are concerned has, to agreat extent, insured the progress of the Boer in South Africa. He haslaid down certain laws at the outset, and he has rigidly adhered tothose laws. He employs a different method of treatment from that whichis attributed to the Natal farmer and others who employ nativeservants. He has never allowed his original attitude towards nativesto become compatible with the British idea; he prefers still to lookupon them as slaves, although he is perforce required to regard themas servants. The difficulty in Natal with regard to the rapidlyincreasing native populace, and how to deal effectually with thequestion, might have arisen in the Orange Free State, for instance,were it not for the fact that the native, in comparison with the whitepopulation, is small. By a Law passed in the Volksraad some few yearsago, it became compulsory for farmers to allow only a limited numberof native families to remain on the farms. This created considerabledissatisfaction among both farmers and natives, and the result wasthat native labour approached the inadequate in a very short time.Hundreds of native families left the State, and although the Lawultimately admitted of a wider interpretation, the native populace hasnot materially increased. The present attitude of natives in the townsis not altogether satisfactory since the passing of this Law. Labourbeing scarce, they are inclined to take up an independent attitude,which, if fraught with little danger, is at least calculated toproduce a certain amount of friction between white and black. Added tothis, there is the fact that the education of natives, which isbecoming more general, undoubtedly assists the growth of thisindependence. The Boer farmers in this connection adhere to theirpristine view of the matter, namely, that educating natives amounts tocasting pearls before swine; and although this does not tend toencourage the work of the missionary, there may possibly be a certainamount of truth in it.Before the arrival of British subjects at the Cape, the Boer had itall his own way. He looked upon himself as practically the ruler ofthe country, and it was not natural that he should look with favourupon the advent of a probable rival. He lived peacefully in away--that is, when he was not in open conflict with the natives. Hekilled his game and cooked it and ate it heartily, and he enjoyed ameasure of happiness. He had found a home; the free-and-easy lifesuited him; and if he was not possessed of riches (which would havebeen of little value to him then), he had, at least, health andstrength and an abundance of daily food.But one day the now accursed Englishman crossed his path, and thatmade a considerable difference. He perhaps wondered why the Englishcame there at all, when he was just beginning to develop a greatcountry. But he did not, of course, know then what he knows now,namely, that the English are insatiable land-grabbers! He looked upontheir advent more in the light of a huge slice of impertinence. Heknew also that it was dangerous to meddle or contend with them, so hemerely looked on with a suspicious eye. He watched their everymovement, and he also very probably looked for the day of theirdeparture. But they did not depart; they had come to stay.The Boer did not like his English neighbours from the start; there wasfar too much of the go-ahead persuasion about them. He wanted to jogalong quietly and cautiously, and he very naturally resented thepresence of people in whom the desire for progression was strong. Solong as the Boer was left to himself he was not aware of his owntardiness. He was very much in the position of a cyclist on the track;it needed a 'pacer' to show how slowly he was travelling. The 'pacer'in this instance brought with him no commendation in the eyes of theBoer; he merely created suspicion and ill-feeling, which ultimatelydeveloped into rancour.When suspicion lays hold of a man it invariably changes the whole ofthat man's character. It did so in the case of the Boer. It debarredany chance of reconciliation with the English for the future. The Boerdoes not know the meaning of compromise, and if he did, it would goagainst his grain to entertain it. His nature is stubborn; he cannotbring himself to look at a question from any other view-point than hisown. He will argue a point for hours, and although he may be in thewrong, it is a moral impossibility to convince him that he is not inthe right. His consummate ignorance may largely account for this; buteven semi-educated Boers are not much better in this respect.The Boer makes an excellent pioneer, and when he found that theEnglish ideas were not compatible with his own, he decided to movefarther north. That is another of his characteristics--independence.He is not only independent to a degree, he is sensitive; and when hediscovers by accident that he is a much-aggrieved party, hisindignation does not usually take a violent form--he simply clearsout. He may be somewhat different where the Transvaal is concerned--hemay be indignant, but he has no intention in this instance of adoptingthe procedure of his forefathers. The latter had not yet dropped intoan inheritance glittering with gold; they were merely agriculturists,and they desired pastures of their own. Some of them found desirablepastures in the barren wastes of the Free State, and subsequently themajority wended their way to the Transvaal.It is not, of course, my intention to reiterate history. History isgood enough when it is new, but I should only be covering ground whichis already familiar to most readers. My purpose is to present glimpsesof the Boer as he is to-day.CHAPTER IIThe Boers are very much like the Scotch--they are clannish. Every Boerhas a solid belief in himself, to begin with, and every Boer has aprofound belief in his brother. This characteristic has manyadvantages: it not only welds a people together, it is a sufficientguarantee of success in times of trouble and difficulty, and it hasstood the Boer in good stead. He likes to tell you that no difficultyis insurmountable in his eyes--nay, further, he does not believe inthe existence of any difficulty which he is not competent to overcome.Rumours of trouble with natives do not appal him, because he knowsbefore he slings his gun over his shoulder that he is going forth toinflict due punishment upon the insurgents. He does not in anyinstance entertain the thought of a repulse. He marches to the frontwith a firm, determined step, and he does not rest until he hasconclusively settled the matter.The march to the front is a sort of family concern. I have triedoccasionally to unravel the relations of the numerous families incertain districts, but it seems to me that the complications are toogreat to admit of analysis. For instance, it will be found that thefamily of Wessels is closely allied to the family of Odendaals, andthe Odendaals, on the other hand, are related to the De Jagers. Thiskind of thing worries and tantalizes a man, and the only safeconclusion to arrive at is that the entire nation is linked togetherin some way or other by family ties. This may account for the factthat it is seldom necessary to introduce one Boer to another--they arevery well acquainted without such formalities; if they are not, theyvery soon strike up an acquaintance.Of course there are exceptions, and I remember one in particular. Theinstance I refer to occurred in a store. One of the gentlemen inquestion was leaning heavily against the counter, and one couldobserve at a glance that he, at least, had a good opinion of himself.Presently Boer number two entered. He was small in stature, like theother man, but there was a note of uncertainty about him which seemedto betoken that his opinion of himself did not measure up inproportion to that of the other Boer. Number two looked about him abit, and occasionally directed a furtive glance at number one, who, onthe other hand, stolidly regarded the array of goods spread out beforehim. Number two seemed to have settled the question in his own mind atlast, for he approached the other party and held out his hand.'I am Britz,' he said laconically, as the other touched theoutstretched hand indifferently.'Ja!' said number one; 'I am Papenfus.'The conversation ended here, and number two made a silent departure.[Illustration: WAGGONS BRINGING WOOL TO EARLY MORNING MARKET(JOHANNESBURG)]The preliminary salutations of another pair of Boers are probably asinteresting. It was during a prolonged drought, and both gentlemen hadevidently experienced a difficulty in finding a sufficiency ofwater for the purposes of ablution. They had not met for a number ofyears, but the recognition was mutual.'Almachtig, Gert, you are still as ugly as ever!''Ja!' replied the other readily; 'and you are still alive with thatface!'The Boer is coarse in his conversation, although he prefers to regardit as wit. He likes to participate in a conversation bristling withthis sort of wit, but when you come to tell him a really good thing,he fails entirely to grasp the point, and your joke falls flat,resulting usually in a painful silence.He is also very chary of complications in the handling of money. Hebrings his wool into town once, and sometimes twice, a year, and thatstaple comprises the current coin of the country. His clip is weighedoff in due course, and he proceeds to the store and sits down whilethe clerk figures up the amount. You may be foolish enough to ask himif he will buy a plough or a bag of coffee, but he continues to smokehard and expectorate all over the floor without giving a definitereply. He wants to handle the money first, and then he will arrangeabout his purchases. Within half an hour he will probably have in hispocket two or three hundred golden sovereigns (he does not look uponbank-notes with favour; he wants something hard and substantial), andhe will at once proceed to the matter of buying. At the end of the dayhis waggon is loaded up with a variety of household and agriculturalnecessities, for which he has paid, say, L150 of the money receivedfor his wool. This is his way of doing things, and he thinks it is theright one.During the Boer War of 1880 merchants in the Free State had a bad timeof it. The Boers were, of course, very much excited, and the Englishmerchant was looked upon scornfully and contemptuously. One Boer hadalready drawn up a memorandum of what he considered should be the_modus operandi_ in dealing with the storekeepers. Two or three wereto be hanged, and the others were to be tied up in front of their ownbuildings and shot down like crows. That was in Harrismith.The Boer has not much to boast of in the matter of brains, but what hedoes possess he is careful not to abuse. A man can abuse his brains inmany ways--by taking to strong drink, for instance. I have been amongBoers for some years, and I can honestly say that I never yet saw aBoer the worse for drink. He may indulge occasionally, but he veryseldom carries the practice to excess. When he does take it he likesit strong--as strong as he can get it. He scorns the idea of mixing itin water. He reckons that he did not go to the canteen or hotel to payfor water. He wants the full value of his money, and he takes it.I have said that the Boer is suspicious; he is likewise jealous bynature. If there happens to be rinderpest on the next farm to his, heis never contented until he gets his full share. He does not mind ifthe visitation plays extreme havoc among his stock so long as he isnot left in the lurch. I remember some time ago hearing of a Boer whohad decided to build a large dwelling-house on his farm in place ofthe wretched little building he and his family had hitherto occupied.This Boer had made some money, and contact with English people in thetowns had resulted in more advanced ideas. He determined, therefore,to spare no expense on this new project--he even included a bath-room.The building was scarcely completed, when about a dozen Boers, whowere also capitalists in a way, immediately set about makingarrangements for similar structures. This form of jealousy is, ofcourse, good where trade is concerned.If the Boer is nothing else, he is at least talked about. I saynothing else advisedly, because he is nothing else. In his own countryhe is nothing, and out of it he is less, if that were possible. It mayseem out of place on the part of a Scotsman to make such an assertion,because a Scotsman (and a Yorkshireman, too, by the way) is, in theeyes of the Boer, a friendly being, and far removed above a mereEnglishman. A Boer will give a Scotsman the best in the house, and putup his horse comfortably, but an Englishman in the same circumstancesfares differently. It is, of course, unnecessary to say that whilea Scotsman makes no objection to exceptional hospitality, his views ofthe Boer do not differ materially from those of any other person ofwhatever nationality. He drinks the Boer's coffee, and shakes handswith him and all his family, but there may be, and usually is, a greatdeal of deception mixed up with such extreme good-feeling. I couldnever understand, nor has it been explained to me, why the Boer is sopartial towards Scotsmen, unless it be that a great many Scotch wordsresemble words in the Dutch language. Perhaps that may in some degreeaccount for it, although I do not think there is anything to be proudof on the Scottish side.[Illustration: A BOER HOMESTEAD]It is necessary to reside in the Boer Republics to place one in theposition of knowing something of the Boer, and a mere fortnight won'tdo it. Of course, there are Boers and Boers, as there are Englishmenand Englishmen. There are Boers who are competent to rank with anyEnglish gentleman, and whose education and abilities are of no meanorder. Unfortunately, however, these are altogether in the minority.The Boers are all farmers, and, according to their own statements, apoverty-stricken people. They plead poverty before an English merchantbecause they fancy it will have the effect of reducing prices.Fortunately, the merchants possess rather an accurate knowledge ofsuch customers, and in consequence they lose nothing. One would assoon believe the generality of Boers, as walk into the shaft of a coalmine. He has a reputation for lying, and he never brings discreditupon that reputation. When he lies, which, on an average, is everyalternate time he opens his mouth, he does so with great enthusiasm,and the while he is delivering one lie, he is carefully consideringthe next. When he can't think of any more lies, he starts on thetruth, but in this he is a decided failure. He is afraid of beingfound out. For instance, a merchant will approach a Boer respecting anoverdue account. The Boer will at once plead poverty, and speculateon how he can possibly manage to liquidate his liability. If themerchant knows the ropes sufficiently (and the majority of merchantsdo), he will drop the subject for half an hour, at the end of whichtime he will ask the Boer if he wants to sell any cattle or produce,as he (the merchant) can find an outlet for either or both. The Boer'sdiplomacy is weak, and he falls into the trap. He has fifty cattle todispose of; the merchant buys them, and the overdue account, withinterest, is paid.The Boers are very superstitious in a great many things. For instance,they regard locusts as a direct visitation from the Almighty. When thepest settles down upon ground occupied by Kaffirs, all the availabletin cans and empty paraffin tins are requisitioned, and there is amighty noise, that ought to frighten off any respectable locust swarm;but the Boer, when he sees them coming, goes into his house and layshold of his Bible, and reads and prays until he thinks there ought tobe some good result. The Boer is gifted with great and abidingpatience (in such cases only), and, no matter if the locusts stop longenough to eat up every green blade on his farm, he will continue tostudy his Bible and pray. But, as I have remarked parenthetically, itis only in cases of emergency where he evinces such a display ofpatience and exercises such a pious disposition. When he is notpraying, he is putting ten-pound stones in his bales of wool to beready for the merchant's scales, and transacting other little mattersof business of a like nature.The Boer is not particular in the matter of cleanliness. It suits himjust as well to be dirty as to be clean. It is no exaggeration to saythat numbers of Boers do not wash themselves from one week's end toanother; and they wear their clothes until they drop off. It is alwaysa matter for speculation what the womenfolks do. It is certain thatthey do not exert themselves too much, if at all, in their own homes.They generally do all the cooking and eating in one room, and in theother end of the house you will probably find a litter of pigs, ascore of hens, etc. And the one room is about as clean as theother--most people would prefer to sleep alongside the pigs and thefowls.The most painful proceeding is to dine in such a place. Unless you areblessed with a cast-iron constitution and a stomach of the samepattern, you are not likely to survive. Usually they put down boiledmeat first, after which comes the soup. The chief regret in your caseis that the soup had not come first, so that you could have disposedof it right away and had something on top of it. Coffee, of course, isnever forgotten, and it would be a direct insult to refuse it. Coffeeis a great thing with the Boer. He would as soon be without house andhome, as his bag of coffee. Before selling his wool to the merchant,almost the first thing he asks is: 'What is your price for coffee?' Ifa satisfactory quotation is forthcoming, he does not hesitate long indisposing of his staple, although, of course, at the highest priceobtainable.The story goes that once upon a time a Boer, whose conscience hadremained dormant from his birth, came to a certain town to purchasegoods in exchange for produce. One of the articles he bought was,naturally, coffee, and of that he took half a bag. While the clerk wasengaged in attending to some other matters, the Boer quietly and, ashe thought, unobserved, undid the cord which secured the mouth of thecoffee bag, and slipped in a quarter of a hundred-weight of lead whichwas lying in the vicinity and which he evidently calculated on findinguseful. The clerk observed this movement without betraying the fact,and when the order was completed his eye fell upon the coffee bagcasually.'Oh! wait a moment,' he remarked. 'I fancy I have forgotten to weighthat coffee.'He weighed it over again and carefully noted down the figures in hislittle book, no doubt much to the chagrin of the silent Boer, whoprobably had not reckoned on paying for his lead in the sameproportion as the cost of his coffee per pound.On another occasion, a Boer, the extent of whose wealth was probablyunknown to himself, found it necessary to dispute certain items in hisaccount with his storekeeper. This sort of thing, by the way, is therule and by no means the exception. It seems natural also when it isnoted that the majority of Boers run twelve-monthly accounts, and bythe time they come to square up, they find a difficulty in recognisingsome of the articles purchased eleven or twelve months previously.This particular gentleman's argument had reference to a pair of spurs,which he deposed had been given to him as a present by the manager,and his hitherto good opinion of the clerk who had charged the spursin his account was permanently damaged. He said he wasn't a man ofthat sort. If he wanted to buy spurs, he could pay cash down for aboutfifteen thousand pairs and, in short, he could buy up all the spurs inthe country! He would pay for those spurs now: he wouldn't take a pairof anything, gratis or otherwise, from that merchant as long as helived. He would go home and put eight horses into his wagonette anddrive round the country and tell all his friends about that pair ofspurs, and he wouldn't rest until he had completed the task to his ownsatisfaction.The book-keeper tried in vain to calm him down by presenting him witha bunch of grapes, but he only regarded the peace-offering withextreme contempt. He wanted to know what else he had been chargedwith, and the clerk, in conciliatory tones, proceeded to read over theseveral items. He came to 'one pound of tea.' That was the last straw.'What! a pound of tea--a pound! Almachtig! Ik koop thee bij de zak (Ibuy tea by the bag).'The suspicious nature of the Boer is always in evidence, although theEnglishman must perforce humour it. It would be interesting to learn,for instance, how many thousands of pounds are sewn up in mattressesall over the country because the owners are chary concerning theintegrity of bank-managers. They have no doubt whatever but that abank is a paying concern (one Boer entered a bank recently andwanted to see the place where they made the money), but they wouldmuch rather keep their own money out of it, in case it should getmixed up with the earnings and savings of other people and be lost.The story runs that one old vrouw journeyed to town in her waggon oneday for the express purpose of depositing L300 with the local bank,but when she found that they wanted to give her so much for keeping it(interest) instead of asking her to pay a small amount by way ofcompensation for taking charge of her money, she became suspicious andtook her L300 back to the farm and the double grass mattress oncemore. It is unnecessary to state that this particular lady nevertrusted another banking institution.[Illustration: WAGGONS CROSSING RIVER]And so it is with other things. When once you have aroused suspicionin the Boer--and it sleeps lightly--you can safely say good-bye to himfor ever. He knows within his heart that the English are bent upontaking advantage of him, and when a man makes up his mind like thathe is seldom disappointed.There is one characteristic of the Boer which the most casual observercannot fail to notice. It is his entire indifference to personalappearance. He likes to see his vrouw gorgeous in all the colours ofthe rainbow (pink and green being the favourites), and he doesn't mindif the material costs a little over ninepence a yard; but he evincesno desire to discard the suit he has himself worn for three or fouryears without a change. So long as it holds together, he is content towear it, and he does not in the least mind what other people may sayabout it. It may be supposed that this applies exclusively to thepoorer classes, but I can assure my readers that I have known it to bethe case with scores of men who could well afford to wear a brand-newsuit every day of the week and every month of the year. And what doesthis characteristic indicate? It indicates the man. He has no desireto advance beyond what he is--what his forefathers were. The lattermanufactured their own clothing; they made their own shoes, and, hadthey been presented with a cast-off suit belonging to the Prince ofWales, they could not possibly have appreciated it, and they certainlywould never have thought of wearing it. The Boer does not care todress respectably; he prefers to finger the coin and sit down andwatch the increase in his stock. He would have everything convertedinto stock, because that is his great ambition.Another thing--he lacks taste. His clothes never by any chance fit him(in the eyes of more refined people), and his boots are always threesizes too large; but then he thinks he is getting more for his money.If he must needs buy boots, he takes care that he invests his money inquantity, not quality, or style.CHAPTER IIIThe Boer would like to lay hands on the man who invented ploughs. Notthat he has any aversion to ploughs as ploughs; he merely objects tothe labour involved by the introduction of these implements into themarket. He sees some sense in an ox, a sheep, a goat, and a horse. Putthese animals on a bit of green veldt, and they do the restthemselves; they thrive and multiply, and enhance the position oftheir owner. But a plough! It means that he requires to take off hiscoat and stop doing nothing. The Boer would like to argue that if Godhad meant the soil to be disturbed by ploughs and such like, He wouldnot have left the solution of this problem in the hands of mereinventors: He would have ordained a means whereby the soil would haveof itself turned over once a year at springtime.The Boers are a pastoral people--one can hardly say an agriculturalpeople. They have been that sort of people from the start, and theywill never change. They are used to waggons and oxen and sheep, andthe waggons and oxen and sheep have got quite used to them. There isabundance of proof in the Dutch Republics to satisfy any ordinaryperson that a Boer, no matter if he can count his sovereigns by themillion, would never dream of giving up his farm and turning countrygentleman. He may take no part in the actual work (and this is notmuch in his line under any circumstances), but he exercises thatamount of careful supervision necessary to successful farming, andcontinues to do so until the end. Even the members of the Volksraad,who are usually well-to-do farmers, never neglect their crops, albeita handsome income is assured in their official capacity.But does farming in the Dutch Republics pay? Most emphatically, No. Iam not making this assertion because I have tried it myself, I amsimply quoting the dictum of every Boer. I have been careful toobtain a consensus of opinion on this question for the guidance ofthose who may contemplate embarking upon such an unsatisfactory anddangerous undertaking. Farming does not pay. For my own satisfaction,I recently questioned a Boer with regard to his average yearly income,and he was good enough to humour me.The value of his stock worked out as follows:     1,000 sheep             say   L 500       100 head of cattle     "     1000        48 horses             "      480                                   -----                                   L1980                                   -----                                              L   s. d.His yearly clip averaged 10 bales @  L10  =  100  0  0On an average he sold:  20 head of cattle               "  L 8  =  160  0  0  10 horses                       "  L10  =  100  0  0  Butter, 1,000 pounds            "   1s. =   50  0  0  Hides and skin                        say    5  0  0  Horns                                  "     1  0  0  Mealies, 60 bags                "  12s. =   36  0  0  Forage, 5,000 bundles           "   3d. =   62 10  0  Kaffir corn, 30 bags            "  15s. =   22 10  0                                            -----------Total average yearly income                 L537  0  0                                            -----------It must not be supposed for one moment that here we have a rich man. Iam merely citing the case of a farmer who said to me: 'I'd rather be abook-keeper at twenty-pounds a month.' He had no idea that his annualincome figured up to anything like L537. And yet that same man wouldendeavour to make a good bargain in purchasing sixpennyworth ofhairpins because he considered himself a 'poor man.'There are hundreds of farmers, more particularly in the Free State,who are unable to realize the extent of their wealth in stock or theacreage of their own farms. They brand every ox, sheep, and horse thatbelongs to them, and it is only by such marks that they are enabled torecognise their own property when they see it. I have known instanceswhere hundreds of horses belonging to one man have succumbed in asingle season on account of horse-sickness, and their owner regardedthe loss as a mere trifle, because he knew that such a catastrophe didnot materially affect his position.Klondyke had its 'millionaires in huts,' Boerland has its millionairesin hovels. You will find farmers who are worth many thousands ofpounds living in places under whose roofs a Kaffir would certainlydisdain to pass the night. They possess wives and families, too, butthey exhibit no desire to better their domestic surroundings. If thehouses happen to include another room other than the living room, thatextra room is invariably used for storing grain. The women are untidyand unprepossessing, and the children have not yet learned toappreciate stockings and shoes. It is almost paradoxical to think ofhuman beings in a civilized country living such lives, people who havegreat possibilities within their reach. The children readilyassimilate the habits and ways of their parents, and grow up into menand women of a like type, and so on from generation to generation. Nowonder, then, that the Boers are a retrograde race.[Illustration: A BOER FAMILY.]It has been made sufficiently plain that when once the Boers haveacquired a country, they allow that country to rest in peace--froman agricultural point of view only. This is quite apparent when it isexplained that the Free State has an estimated acreage of 7,491,500,and out of that only 75,000 acres are cultivated. This is not thefault of the country, but of the Boer himself. He has no soonersettled down on a bit of land, where there is a plentiful growth ofgrass to feed his stock, than he longs for pastures new, his onlyreason for staying where he is being that he does not want theEnglishman to step into his homestead.No exhibition of national prejudice is intended when I say that werethe Dutch Republics sprinkled with a few hundred Scottish farmers,these countries would assume a more fertile and healthy aspect in twoor three years. The soil is good; all that is wanted is concentratedhard work, and the countries would surprise several people--the Boers,for instance--by the extent of their agricultural wealth. There are,of course, climatic disadvantages to contend against--prolongeddroughts are of common occurrence--but, as in other countries, thefarmer must take the bad with the good. The great thing with the Boeris stock, and plenty of it. He does not care about anything else untilthe rinderpest comes.Comparisons are odious, but let us compare the Boer with the Englishfarmers. Should the harvests of the latter be destroyed (as in thecase of an entire county of farmers in England at one time), ruinstares them in the face, showing that stock is of little moment. It isdifferent in the case of the Boer. Take his stock away from him, andyou deprive him of his daily bread. Of course, the facilities forsuccessful cultivation in England are different from those in theDutch Republics; at the same time, there is such a thing asirrigation, and were this resorted to more generally, and a largerarea of land put under cultivation, the Boer farmer would be on a morestable footing.A somewhat erroneous deduction has been gleaned by many people fromguide-books, in which particulars are given respecting the limitedextent of arable land available, but guide-book makers mostly preferto guess at the figures rather than go to the trouble of ascertainingthe truth. Without further reference to the guide-books, it isnoteworthy that the possibilities of both the Transvaal and Free State,from an agricultural point of view, are greatly under-estimated, thefact being that a very small proportion of arable land is cultivated atall. In a number of cases water facilities are entirely ignored.Wool is the current coin of the country with the Boer farmers, and themerchant who is desirous of continuing his business must have acertain amount of capital behind him, because the farmer likes to seemoney at least once a year. Things have changed somewhat now. In theolden days it was different. It was absolutely necessary then to putdown a cheque for the full amount, but the average farmer is becomingless suspicious in transactions of this nature.The life of the merchant during the wool season is not exactly a happyone. He likes to please his customers, but he does not alwayssucceed. The average farmer who comes in with a load of wool has theappearance of a man whose primary intention is to buy up all thestores (although he may go away with a bag of coffee only), andafterwards consider with great deliberation the question of acquiringthe whole town. All this is based upon the fact that he has a load ofwool for sale. The merchant would rather give him five shillings thanfivepence per pound, because it would be a certain sign that the goodtimes had arrived. No matter, however, what price the merchant offers,your average farmer can always obtain more. He does not say where; heprefers to keep that up his sleeve. He also advances by farthings andhalfpence, because he is chary about entering into the intricacies ofeighths. He, moreover, strongly objects to accepting a lower pricethan that given to his neighbour. His neighbour may be an excellentman, and he may be in possession of very good sheep, but that his woolshould be more valuable is not so apparent--is, in fact, mostimprobable. Every farmer has implicit faith in the merits of his ownparticular clip, and if differences really exist, he is prepared tostate emphatically that the advantage is on his side.CHAPTER IVThere has been a good deal of speculation as to why the Boers are suchexperts with the rifle, but that is easily and naturally explained. Inthe first place, they know their own country, and that is a decidedadvantage where bare veldt is concerned. An Englishman on the sameground would make mistakes, and probably sight his rifle at 200 yards;but the Boer puts his up to 500 yards and kills his game, whilst theEnglishman, with his imperfect knowledge of the country, misses it.When the Dutch first settled in South Africa, they were compelledeither to shoot their dinner or go without. So they began straightaway by shooting their dinner--and they have been able to shoot itever since. In warfare, too, they know exactly how to proceed. Theyknow that it is policy to shoot the Englishmen and save their ownskins. So they get behind large stones and shoot the Englishmen. Theyknow, further, that the best guarantee of success is to waitpatiently. They know nothing about military discipline, and they don'twant to know anything about it. According to their idea, this is howthe crack British regiments proceed: They march up in a body--closeorder--and when they come within range of the Boers the commandingofficer gives the following commands: 'Halt! Attention! Present!Fire!' And by the time the commanding officer has given the word'Fire!' the Boers, comfortably stationed behind stones, have shotthose regiments down! There is, perhaps, some truth in this.But the Boer, after all, believes in peace. It suits him better to beon his farm, with a pipe in his mouth, and Kaffirs to do all the work,while he walks around his acres and finds fault. They stick to theircountry, and they fight for their country; but they don't likefighting much. I came across one particular Boer who had been atMajuba, and who was perfectly clear in his own mind that he did notcare much about it; and he did not entertain favourably the idea offurther warfare. He explained that he quietly got behind the customarystone, and shot round the corners. During the time he was thus amusinghimself, the stone was struck by fifteen English bullets, and he didnot calculate on waiting to see what effect number sixteen would have,so he left that stone. The Boers are always very reticent where thenumber of their killed is concerned. In English circles it isjocularly asserted that only one Boer was killed at Majuba, and allthe other Boers went into mourning for him. It is not known, and neverwill be known, how many were killed at Krugersdorp by Jameson's men.There is one thing, however, which goes to prove that a good numbermust have succumbed on that occasion. It is rumoured that the Boers donot want any more fighting with men who shoot as straight as thosecomprising Jameson's Horse.[Illustration: MAJUBA HILL.]Defence in the Transvaal and Orange Free State is provided forprincipally by the burghers, who are liable to be called upon foractive service between the ages of eighteen and sixty. The mountedpolice force in both Republics is comparatively small, and thepermanent corps of artillery in each case is also small. The Boers donot, as a matter of fact, repose much confidence in artillery at anytime, and they regard the mounted police force as valuable only intime of peace. The burghers themselves comprise the entire force. Inthe Free State alone there are 17,000 burghers liable to be called upon commando at a moment's notice.The country is divided into districts, and each district is under thecharge of a Commandant and a Field-cornet. The duty of the latter isto warn the burghers on receipt of instructions from his Chief, and hemay also call a meeting of burghers in his district should any crisisof a serious nature be imminent. On the whole, the Field-cornet's lifeis not a happy one; and although he has numerous opportunities ofmaking himself objectionable and disagreeable, he usually prefers toperform his onerous duties in a humble and unassuming spirit. In timesof peace those duties are few. In the first place, he must satisfyhimself that all the burghers in his district are in possession ofrifles and ammunition; and in the second place, he must call theburghers together once a year for inspection. The good old times arenow over when a score of burghers could with impunity produce one andthe same rifle. In those days it was customary for burghers to appearfor inspection when convenient to themselves, and in thesecircumstances it was not a difficult matter to borrow your neighbour'srifle and present it as your own. But this little game was found out,and an order was at once issued to the effect that all burghers mustassemble at one particular hour. The weapons used are of differentkinds, but they must all be breech-loaders. Every burgher mustlikewise be in possession of thirty rounds of ammunition, and in timeof war the Government supply unlimited ammunition. Should the burghersbe called out to action, they must supply themselves with provisionsto last fourteen days. This might be difficult to carry out, but theexplanation is simple. The provisions consist solely of biltong--thatis, dried meat, generally venison. The sustenance contained in even aninch of this is such that the fourteen days' provision amounts to butlittle in bulk. It is said that if a Boer has a rifle, ammunition, anda piece of biltong in his pocket, he will fight till further orders.It is surprising how quickly the burgher forces can be levied. Thiswas made very apparent when Dr. Jameson marched into the country onDecember 29, 1895. It is also well known that news travels quickly,even in the outlying districts, and in this respect the Boers appearto be quite as remarkable as the Kaffirs.All this military discipline might seem to be only good in itself,were it not for the fact that the Boers still retain their reputationfor being good shots. Even the young men are not behind their fathersin the masterly manipulation of their rifles; in fact, while a largenumber of Englishmen are reputed to be born with silver spoons intheir mouths, the birth-right of every Boer is undoubtedly the rifle.Both in the Transvaal and Free State there exists a healthy spirit ofrivalry between Englishman and Boer in the shooting line. Competitionsare very frequently arranged; it is to the credit of the colonialEnglishman that he can give a good account of himself, and at the sametime hold his own against any Boer. This is fortunate, because theBoer always respects a man who can record as many bull's-eyes ashimself, no matter what his nationality may be. The great opportunitythe Boer had of giving vent to his contempt for the English was whenthe latter appeared on the battlefield in compact regiments, andafforded the best possible target for shooting at from behind the nowproverbial stone.In these times of universal political difficulties it may beinteresting to survey the position of the Orange Free State now thatwar has actually broken out with Great Britain. There is a patriotismlurking in the breast of the Boer which would indicate that his greataim was the overthrow of the hated Englishman. It would not beadvisable to quote the opinion the generality of Boers have of thepoor Englishman; needless to say it is strong, emphatic,comprehensive, and by no means complimentary. Obviously the origin ofsuch opinion concentrates in the fact that the Englishman is toopersevering in other people's countries, and, moreover, shows anaptitude for developing the said countries which, in the opinion ofthe Boer, is altogether too progressive. It is, of course, a pity thatthe Englishman cannot accommodate himself to the antiquated ideas ofthe Boer, because if he could, he would probably exonerate himself inthe Dutch eyes, and at the same time find himself away back in theeighteenth century. But in this advanced age he is too much for theBoer, and this is probably the explanation of the existing friction.The Orange Free State has all along evinced a helping-hand whereTransvaal broils have occurred. This is not surprising, consideringthat the Free State is governed by a Volksraad wholly in sympathy withthe mighty Oom Paul. In the time of President Brand things wereslightly different, although even his Volksraad held him in check andexercised its own influence. But President Brand had sense enough tosee that participation in Transvaal difficulties could in no waybenefit the Free State, and, in fact, that interference was notdesirable or advisable. When the previous Boer War broke out, heintimated that no commandeering would be enforced in the Free State,but that those burghers who chose to engage in warfare might do so. Hewould take no active steps until the independence of the Free Statewas endangered.His successor in office, President Reitz, was not credited withanything in particular, but it was understood that should theVolksraad decide to co-operate with the Transvaal in any instance, hewould willingly give his consent. This was confirmed when Dr.Jameson's entrance into the Transvaal was made known. Threedistricts of the Free State were promptly commandeered, and burghersswarmed to the border.[Illustration: A BOER ENCAMPMENT]About the same time President Reitz vacated his office, and PresidentSteyn is now at the head of affairs. President Steyn has nowconclusively shown his sympathy with the Transvaal, and his occasionalinterviews with Oom Paul were presumably for the purpose of ratifyingthe compact from time to time. This is confirmed by the fact that theVolksraad some considerable time ago proclaimed that, when hostilitiesbroke out in the Transvaal, the burghers were to hold themselves inreadiness to proceed to the border. This was not merely with theobject of protecting the border, but to render assistance to thoseacross the border, and now they have joined their neighbours ininvading Natal.The feeling amongst Englishmen in the Free State was, of course,strong, but Englishmen are not considered in the matter at all. Ifthey are burghers of the State, they must perforce conform to thelaws thereof, and fight to the death even against their own relations.If they refuse to go to the front, it is not certain what wouldhappen.There is another aspect of the question, and a serious one, too. Whenthe Free State burghers were called to the border, and war wasactually declared, they feared that they would return to their homesonly to find that their wives and children had been murdered, theircattle stolen, and their property burnt to the ground. This new andterrible danger came from Basutoland. The Basutos have a grudgeagainst the Boers, and they were only waiting an opportunity to wipeout that grudge for ever. They are a warlike race, they are wellsupplied with arms, and their horsemanship is notorious. They like theEnglishman, but they look upon the Boer as something to wipe off theface of the earth. Of course, their discrimination between English andDutch when the time comes for them to take action, if it ever doescome, will not save the Englishmen in the Free State.The Basuto question may not have escaped the notice of the Volksraadin their anxiety to assist their brethren in the Transvaal, but theiraction would seem to indicate that it had. Had they been wise, theywould have left their sister country to settle its own affairs, andhave looked nearer home for something to do; but this view, althoughnow too late, may already have engaged their attention.Apart from the Government of the country, it may be interesting toreflect upon the opinions of the burghers themselves, i.e., the Dutchburghers. The majority of the young men originally favoured the actionof the Volksraad. They had not tasted war; they had only heard aboutit; and their contempt for the English race generally suggested atrial. Their enthusiasm was undoubtedly great, and the idea of lendinga helping-hand to another country evidently fascinated them. But theirelders have now come to look upon interference as bad policy, and theydread the possibility of handing over their possessions to the wilyBasuto. The feelings of the Free State Boers towards their Englishfriends were scarcely so vindictive as in the Transvaal, but perhapsthat is because there are no gold mines in the Free State.CHAPTER VIt must not be supposed that the intelligent Boer is non-existent;but, as I have said, he is in the minority. He reads the newspapers,and he has a great deal to say on both sides. He has very few personalprejudices; his whole concern is concentrated in a desire to furtherthe progress of the country. His mind is developed; he does not regardthe Englishman as an interloper; he wants 'to live and let live.'There is, unfortunately, the other element, a most undesirableone--the Boer who is continually stirring up ill-feeling. You willfind him everywhere, and he is always at it. If his own brotherhappened to be an educated man, he could not get on with him; hisnature is despicable. President Kruger thinks that race hatred willgradually disappear, for 'wherever love dwells, prosperity mustfollow.' Can anyone imagine love existing in the nature of the man Ihave cited? President Kruger himself is an educated man, an able manin his own sphere. If he practises the art of brotherly love to thesame extent that he preaches it, why does he not make some arrangementby which it would be possible to instil a portion of the sentimentinto some of his erring children? Then we should have no more racialhatred to concern ourselves with; we should have instead the inspiringspectacle of a reclaimed Dutchman falling upon the neck of his Englishnext-door neighbour and weeping.At the same time, however, even supposing Oom Paul's influence werecapable of producing such picturesque results, it would be wellmeantime if a little fundamental education could be introduced. Thismay seem impracticable at the first blush, considering that thepopulation is so widely scattered, but no doubt there is some hiddensolution. Ignorance is accountable in a great measure for theill-feeling which exists between Dutch and English, and rancour cannotbe removed until ignorance is ordered out through the back-door.[Illustration: RAADZAAL, OR BOER PARLIAMENT HOUSE.]There is also the fact that the generality of the people exhibitlittle or no interest in the leaders of their Government. It is saidthat the perusal of biography ennobles and develops the mind. This isalso the case when a man follows with interest and profit the maturereasoning and diplomatical tact of some of our present-daypoliticians. I say some of them, because not all of them exhibit thatintellectual refinement which characterized the great Plato. Still, agreat many people might acquire a tolerable education if they appliedthemselves to the perusal of newspapers in this way, and it is my firmbelief that the Boers would benefit by such a course.The average Boer does not know exactly the meaning of the word'politics,' except that in most things he prefers to be conservative.He likes to move along very quietly, without any outsideinterference. He knows full well that he has sent his representativeto Parliament, and he leaves that member severely alone. Sometimes themember calls a public meeting of his own accord, and the Boer attendsthat meeting, not because he is anxious to bring forward any matteraffecting the welfare of his country or district, nor because themember has failed to satisfy him, but merely because he is desirous ofmeeting his fellow-men and discussing crops and Kaffirs and oxen andsheep and wool--in short, anything outside of politics, in which heprofesses no interest whatever. He is not interested in generalmeasures for the benefit of the whole country; his attention is fullyoccupied with the affairs of his own particular piece of land, and solong as he himself prospers, he does not trouble about the prosperityor otherwise of his neighbours.Oom Paul is the leading light, and should he elect to do this or that,he need exercise no discretion concerning the probable feeling of thecountry. He is the man at the wheel, and the crew have such implicitfaith in him that he can practically steer where he wills. He maysometimes experience a little opposition in the House, but he islong-headed as well as hard-headed, and he invariably holds the trumpcard. He is not a Boer in the ordinary sense of the word; he is only aBoer in the sense that he smokes hard and prefers coffee. He lives ina very ordinary dwelling-house, and it is even stated that his vrouwstarches and irons his dress-shirts, but this may only be surmise. Atall events he does not allow these trifles to worry him, his renowneddiplomacy being directed chiefly to the management of his cosmopolitanchildren, who are apt occasionally to wax troublesome and exceed thebounds of caution.[Illustration: PRESIDENT KRUGER'S HOUSE.]When a Government assumes a more or less aggressive attitude, orsomething tantamount, it is safe to predict that such a Governmentwill encounter difficulties. It may be a good Government; but it willnot be a successful one. The actions of any Government reflect uponthe country, adversely or otherwise. In a country like the Transvaal,the Government is a weighty concern which does not so much considerthe voice of the people as the preservation of its own individualsanctity. The presidential chair represents the universal criterioneither for good or for evil, although it is not usually associatedwith evil. It practises the art of cabling--with Mr. Chamberlain forpreference. The voice of the people is duly represented, but it is avery weak and halfhearted voice. There is not that hearty ring in itwhich is so marked when, for instance, a crowd of Englishmen greettheir Queen. President Kruger represents the Transvaal burghers, andthe requisitions which are published previous to the Presidentialelection are sufficient and convincing proof that he is a popular andhighly respected man. These requisitions usually refer in a generalway to the numerous difficulties through which Oom Paul has so ablypiloted the country. According to such requisitions innumerabledifficulties have assailed the poor country on all sides, and thegeneral tone throughout would imply that they were insidious anduncalled for. The country had done nothing; the people had gone abouttheir business innocently, and attended church regularly, and nothoughts of intrigue or anything resembling it had existed in theirbosoms. Their desire was to govern the country honestly and with aview only to its prosperity, adopting precautions at the same timewhich would exclude the participation of foreigners--Englishmen, forexample. They didn't believe in the English element; it was toodangerous. The President all the while tried to make out that he likedthe English; but he didn't. Of course, a great Power like theTransvaal must keep up appearances. The German Emperor, for instance,doesn't say straight out that the English are a bad lot, and thereforeOom Paul must not display official ignorance by doing that which theGerman Emperor does not do. A man may not exactly be born a King, or aPresident, but he can learn a lot of useful little formalities bywatching the other Kings and Presidents. It will be observed,therefore, that the Transvaal has all along been very docile andconsequently very badly used. And because it has displayed the bestand noblest qualities and on all occasions endeavoured to obviatefriction with other people, it has been unjustly assailed and trampledupon.Oom Paul is a very good man, but he kicks at the traces a great deal.He likes to go out of his way to find out what other people are sayingabout him, and he displays, moreover, another undesirablecharacteristic--he is suspicious. It is in the family; it is in thewhole people. He is continually working himself up into the conditionof a man whose highly-strung nerves convince him that the whole worldis against him. He always imagined that everybody was working outplans of campaign by which it would be possible to annex the Transvaalto the British Empire. Fortunately there were other matters and othercountries to consider, and if Oom Paul would just study a map of theworld for a few weeks and reflect, he would probably find his positionless irksome. But Oom Paul has a great deal to think about--he mustthink for the whole nation. The 'unfortunate affair which occurredafter 1895' seems to trouble him a great deal. Despite the fact thatthe country was well paid for it, this incident seems fated to crop upat least every six months, and it will be handed down to generationsuntold, so that it may ever be kept green. It will be nurtured andwell looked after, and the one regret will be that it does not bringin an annual income in proportion to the original amount.[Illustration: PRESIDENT KRUGER.]The Boer's politics are summed up in the single word 'Defence.' He isnot aggressive, but he is strong on Defence. Possession with him isten points of the law--it is everything. Let the independence of hiscountry be threatened, and he is at once a man of action. Hefiguratively converts his ploughshare into a sword, although the usesof that weapon are unknown to him. At the time of the Jameson Raid itmay safely be asserted that there did not exist a single Boer--youngor old--who was not in possession of a serviceable firearm and thefull complement of ammunition. The Kantoors--i.e., the Governmentoffices--were daily besieged by eager men as eager to possessthemselves of the instruments and munitions of war. Every man wasready; farmers were no longer farmers, but soldiers, prepared to facethe worst in the defence of their only love--their country.CHAPTER VIThe Boer is not what one would call a sentimental person; he ispractical in all his ways. If he sees a thunderstorm approaching, hedoes not go into raptures over the magnificence of the lightning; hewatches that thunderstorm calmly and philosophically. And if he hadanything to do with the order of the elements, he would have thatthunderstorm come his way, and he would detain it exactly three daysover his particular farm, so that the rain should leave a lastingimpression upon his mealies and forage. The Boer likes wet weather,probably because he gets so little of it.I have said that the Boer is practical in all things; he is even so inlove. The old story concerning the 'opzit' candle may have applied informer days, but the Boer of the present day does not waste his timein any such fashion. He has probably become cognisant of thematch-making methods practised by other nations, and he has,therefore, abandoned that affected by his forefathers. It is still acommon thing, however, to see him astride a horse with a sleek skinand noble appearance and plenty of life in it, cantering gaily towardsthe residence of his beloved or intended. Sometimes, too, in order,perhaps, to add more lustre to his own appearance, he is to be seensuffering untold agony under the unyielding brim of a tall, white felthat, trimmed with green veiling. He likes to look imposing, and so hegets under that hat. This in many instances may account for therestiveness of his steed, which is as yet unaccustomed to the weightof a person with such a grotesque headgear.The Boer has several methods of courting. There is one thing heobjects very strongly to, however--he doesn't like courting in adrawing-room; he prefers a dark and quiet corner on the veranda. Letus picture a little scene in this connection. Observe young Piet,dressed in his best Sunday suit, and wearing a worried look inaddition, sitting on one end of a long form that stands on the verandaof the house; and observe also a fair young damsel, who has just beeninitiated into the art of doing her hair up on top, sitting on theother extreme end of that form. The night may be dark and only thestars visible, or the moon may be shining brightly overhead, castingshadows awry here and there, and endeavouring to catch a furtiveglimpse of the lovers under cover of the veranda.A painful silence takes the place of conversation at the outset, andyoung Piet occasionally coughs in an apologetic manner. When he doessum up sufficient courage, the moon has travelled a considerabledistance; but then Piet is not so sentimental as to make any referencewhatever to the moon.'That's a fine horse your father has bought of Dirk Odendaal,' saysPiet, in a tone which suggests that his new paper collar, purchasedfor the occasion, is choking him.A two minutes' pause ensues.'Ja! Piet,' agreeably assents the maiden after an interval which Pietreckons must be at least half an hour--and he has forgotten about thenew horse altogether.'Your father's oxen are looking well after the rain,' continues Pietsome minutes later; and this time he has reduced the space betweenhimself and the maiden by about three inches.After the lapse of another few minutes, the maiden, who is evidentlybashful, ventures again, 'Ja! Piet.'Piet's eyes wander away across the open veldt in front of him, andgradually from the observation of kopjes, they wander upwards towardsthe pale moon; but, as has already been remarked, that luminarysuggests no new theme in the mind of Piet.'The last Nachtmaal was very good.'With this he once more edges away from his end of the form and coversan additional three inches.'Ja! Piet.'Another person would have become exasperated at this stage, but not soPiet.'The new minister preaches very well,' is followed up by an advance ofthree more inches.'Ja, Piet!'The form may be an inconveniently long one, and this naturally hampersPiet somewhat, because by the time he has covered half the distance,his stock of remarks may be exhausted. But he gets close up in time,by the exercise of perseverance, and when he is at last in a positionto manipulate his left arm in connection with the maiden's waist, hedoes so with a sigh of relief.'I think I love you a great deal,' is what he says when he has placedhis arm to his satisfaction. The maiden whispers 'Ja, Piet!' and thething is done.But the young Boer does not attach so much importance to pleasantfeatures and agreeable dispositions, as he does to the worldlystanding of the lady's parents. If there is the slightest prospect ofa handsome dowry in the shape of one or two farms, the inducement toenter into married bliss is, of course, greater than in the case ofthe young lady who merely brings with her a nice set of false teethand a pleasant countenance. Young widows are in great demandthroughout the country, because, as a rule, they are in possession offarms and stock which require the undivided attention of a responsibleman, and that man must be a husband.Such an instance occurred only the other day. This very fortunateyoung man, before his betrothal, could conveniently count his richeson the fingers of his left hand--in pence! But he is happy now,because he can bring in a load of wool every year with his own waggonand oxen, and talk to the merchant with all the swagger and assuranceof a full-blown capitalist.It must not be supposed that such occurrences are uncommon; theyhappen almost every week, which would seem to indicate that rich youngwidows are very plentiful.In these latter days a Boer wedding is arranged on a very grand scale.No matter if the young couple reside fifty miles from the nearesttown, they all come in to church to get fixed up. Friends andrelations arrive, with great ostentation, in conveyances drawn byfour, six, and sometimes eight, horses, the number depending on thewealth of the families. They come from far and near. You can see themcoming to town when they are yet miles away across the veldt--that is,if the day is bright. The dresses of the women-folks flash gaily inthe sun, and the old vrouw would not change places with the Queen ofHolland as she proudly surveys her offspring seated around her in thewagonette. The old man presides unctuously at the ribbons, and hecracks his whip every now and then just to let his team know that heis there, and that he is a very capable person.[Illustration: DUTCH CHURCH (PRETORIA)]The generality of weddings are uninteresting, but occasionallysomething unique is introduced. In the town of Harrismith a very longtime ago, a transport-rider decided to take unto himself a fairpartner. He was a practical sort of person, and in cases of this kindhe did not believe in allowing business to become a secondaryconsideration. Transport-riding in those days paid very handsomely,and the intervention of side issues might have meant a serious loss.Accordingly, this particular gentleman (who had meantime been loadingup coal) repaired to his tent-waggon at the appointed hour, andproceeded to attire himself in the conventional black suit. In orderto economize time, he pulled his best clothes over his workinggarments, and hastily rubbing his face and hands with a coarse towel,he hurried towards the church. Within ten minutes he was back againloading up coal, his better half being occupied in preparing dinner.The Dutch are not a musical nation, and for convincing proof it isonly necessary to attend Divine service in any of their churches.Their rendition of psalm-tunes reminds me of A.K.H.B.'s storyregarding the lonely Italian, who, passing the Iron Church inEdinburgh one Sunday morning while the congregation were engaged inpraise, and on inquiring of the beadle 'What that horrible noise was?'remarked very sorrowfully, 'Then their God must have no ear formusic' It is strange, nevertheless, that no matter how poor a Boer maybe, he will have an organ in his house. There are instancesinnumerable where the only respectable piece of furniture in the houseis an organ. It does not, of course, follow that every Boer is amusician, but it is a fact that nearly every Boer knows how to produceat least one tune, even if it is only the Volkslied or nationalanthem. They will come into the stores, and the first thing they do isto sit down at an organ and show people generally what they can do. Inthe meantime the English merchant and his clerks fume around and vowall sorts of things under their breath, but the indefatigable Boerknows nothing of all this, and he would not care if he did.CHAPTER VIIBesides the everlasting worry of keeping the English community inhand, the Boers have been visited by other plagues, such asrinderpest. In 1897 such a calamity befell them, and although the richfarmers did not suffer materially, the poorer class experiencedreverses sufficient to discourage them for life. The mistake made wassimply this (and it is characteristic of the Boers): every individualfarmer and owner of stock exercised his own judgment throughout, andthe most drastic results followed as a consequence. Temporaryexcitement naturally took the place of clear judgment. A man may bepossessed of all his faculties and yet lack that knowledge which wouldsave 95 per cent. of his cattle. The desire to save the cattle wasthere, but the farmers were too prone to accept the first methodwhich turned up. Without even considering thoroughly the merits anddemerits of any particular method, they rushed at it with the sameprospect of success as might be attributed to a blind man going insearch of the North Pole. Of course the system would 'either kill orcure.' That was how the majority of them put it. The veterinarysurgeons received very little encouragement. If a Boer makes up hismind that his cattle are going to die, he likes to have all the honourof killing them himself, and he does not want any vet. about hisplace, propounding advanced theories which he does not understand.Added to this, it appears that when the disease first made itsappearance in the country, certain vets, made themselves so ridiculousin the eyes of the farmers who invited them to inspect sick cattle,that distrust immediately took the place of suspicion, and confidencewas never established.[Illustration: BOER CATTLE FARM NEAR MAJUBA.]The farmers who managed to save a considerable number of cattle werenot slow to make hay while the sun shone, and some of them mayprobably have turned up their noses at the mere mention of the Yukongoldfields. Prospecting for gold is a somewhat risky business, but theBoer looks upon transactions in salted oxen as eminently satisfactory,more especially where the buyer negotiates the risks. Nothing affordshim more pleasure than to hand over twenty or thirty oxen, and receivein exchange twenty-five pounds per head. But, unlike the Englishproblem, rinderpest is not always with the Boer.In this connection there is a story to the effect that a certain Boerfarmer discovered one day that his cattle had contracted a veryserious disease, and he was advised by the Government vet., whohappened to be passing that way, to inoculate immediately, and afterthe lapse of ten days to repeat the process. When the vet. returned afew weeks later he was surprised to learn that the majority of thecattle had died.'But that was impossible if you acted on the instructions I gaveyou,' he said to the farmer.'Ja!' answered the latter, 'that may be, but I didn't do what you toldme; I only inoculated once.''And why didn't you do it a second time?' pursued the vet.'Oh,' replied the Boer, 'because the vrouw said I hadn't to.'[Illustration: SHOOTING RINDERPEST OXEN.]The Boer seldom does anything without first consulting his wife, and itis hinted that the wives made a very bad job of the rinderpest. Thevrouw steers the ship. It is so when the whole family goes to town tomake the half-yearly purchases. In the stores the husband will be foundin deep and earnest conversation with his better half, relative perhapsto the quantity of barbed wire or coffee or woolpacks--anything andeverything required at the time. All this would seem to point to aplain fact, namely, that the vrouw not only excels in physicalproportions, but also in the matter of brains. There can be no doubtabout the first mentioned, and there seems to be little question aboutthe other as well. It is authoritatively stated that at the time of theBoer War the women were so bitter against the English that they spurredon the men to do things which they themselves deemed foolhardy. Thisanti-English feeling seems to have been intensified since then, and itis often jocularly remarked by Englishmen in the country that so longas an enemy makes things square with the womenfolk they need have nofear of the men. The women may have the reputation of knowing and doingmore than the men, but they are certainly not thrifty. They are kind totravellers (provided they come on horseback and not on foot); but theirkindness is too often spoiled by the dirt and general undesirability ofthe atmosphere within their dwellings. A traveller can appreciate a cupof coffee after a long ride; but he likes to have it in a clean dish,and it rather damps his ardour when he finds that he is expected totake the mud along with it.[Illustration: WAGGON ON PONTOON OVER RIVER.]In this connection there is still another story. This story is relatedby a commercial traveller, and in order to establish itsauthenticity it is only necessary to remark that it has been relatedby at least six different commercial travellers, and in every case theincident has occurred within the experience of each and all.The commercial gentleman (no matter which one) having been overtakenon the road by a severe thunderstorm, and arriving at a spruit whichhe found he could not then cross with safety, put back to a smallfarmhouse near by. After much parley on both sides, the Boer who ownedthe place agreed to give the traveller and his driver shelter for thenight, provided they would sleep in an outhouse, where the horsescould also be put up. Being only too glad to obtain shelter of anysort, the traveller readily accepted the offer. At this point eachtraveller who has told the story breaks into a graphic description ofhow he passed the night, and how many rats he and the driver killed,and how much of his clothes they devoured, and how he couldn't sleepbecause of the presence of pigs and fowls in addition, which seemedto resent the invasion. Then comes the dawn of another day, and, whichis more important (before its appearance), breakfast. A cloth wasspread on a box in the mud-floor dwelling, and eggs and coffee placedthereon. The commercial was evidently expected to eat the eggs anyhow,so long as he did eat them; for there was nothing visible in the shapeof a spoon. The Boer and his vrouw did not put in an appearance atbreakfast, no doubt disdaining to look upon an Englishman any morethan was absolutely necessary. He had almost concluded this rude andsomewhat unsatisfactory meal when the vrouw entered. She was fat anddirty, and her clothing had apparently been renewed from timeimmemorial by much mending. She now rested her great hands on herhips, and calmly surveyed the English party and the breakfast-tablefor a few seconds. Then she spoke, in Dutch; but he understood--toowell:'Have you finished?''Yes,' he replied in the 'lands taal'; 'but surely you are in a verygreat hurry. I will pay you well for the food and shelter.''That's nothing,' continued the vrouw in a business-like tone; 'I onlywant the tablecloth so that I can get the bed made.'CHAPTER VIIIThe Boer is a pious person, who prays to God when he wants rain, andforgets to pray when his mealie crop proves a success. Unlike otherpeople, he does not believe in thanksgiving when he shells one hundredbags of mealies where he only expected twenty. He has no 'harvesthome.' He simply stores his mealies until such time as he can bringthem to town and obtain the best possible price. But let the rain stopaway too long and the sun wither up his crops, and he is a verydifferent man. In every Boer house there is a large Bible, and thatBible is systematically read and re-read when the fates are unkind.The very low class Boer is, of course, unable to read his Bible, buthe takes it over to his nearest neighbour, whose education may nothave been neglected to the same extent.[Illustration: BOERS OUTSPANNED FOR NACHTMAAL.]The Boer journeys to town once every three months with his family inorder to attend Divine Service. These occasions are known asNachtmaal. He brings his waggon with him, and outspans on some openspace within the town. When he cannot arrange for a room or roomsgratis, he sleeps in his tent waggon. He very seldom goes to a hotel,unless this course is absolutely necessary. If he does go to a hotel,he engages a room only, and dines alongside his waggon or else he goesto his particular storekeeper and indulges in sardines and sweetbiscuits He is great on sardines, and his only regret perhaps, is thatthe tin is not edible also.A Dutch Nachtmaal in the olden days was a sight quite equal to anyLord Mayor's show. The costumes were unique; but in the present daythe womenfolk in particular have learned to ape the English, and thecolours are therefore less conspicuous. Formerly the young ladies woreshort dresses of many colours, and the display of white stockings wasvery general. The men appeared in black felt hats with huge brims,and frock-coats (most of them bordering on green) were the order ofthe day. Veldschoens of home manufacture were never wanting, but inthese latter days veldschoens are regarded with contempt.The man who probably suffers most at Nachtmaal-time is the organist,for organs are now regarded as indispensable. An organist is usually aman of a sensitive nature, and on such occasions his ideas of goodmusic are apt to be completely demoralized. Nevertheless, he getsalong as best he can, and even if he happens to be dragging acongregation numbering three hundred voices seven whole notes behindhis instrument, he continues to suffer nobly and silently.The services commence at 7 a.m., and continue throughout the day until9.30 p.m. Baptisms occupy a few hours during the afternoon, and themost common names for youthful burghers are Gert, Barend, Paul, Piet,and such like. The Boers do not believe in departing from thetime-honoured names of their forefathers. Piet suggests the immortalname of Piet Retief, and Paul--well, there is Oom Paul.Before the marriage ceremony can be performed in a Dutch ReformedChurch, the minister must satisfy himself that the contracting partieshave previously been confirmed. Great preparation for the confirmationis engaged in by the young people a week before Nachtmaal Sunday, onwhich day, in presence of the whole congregation, they are receivedinto the bosom of the Church.The Boer is very conscientious in the matter of religion. Forinstance, should he be on bad terms with any of his friends orrelations, he will not attend Divine Service. He argues that a man whois not at peace with his fellow-men cannot hope for reconciliationwith his God until the difference has been amicably settled.It may be observed that the order of service in a Dutch Church is verysimilar to that in vogue in a country church in Scotland. The minutestdetails have much in common, but perhaps I had better not enlargeupon such a coincidence. Before each service the menfolk linger infront of the church door, with their hands stuck deep down in theirpockets and the inevitable pipe between their teeth. They talk aboutalmost everything except religion--the crops, their petty difficultieswith Kaffirs, the last hailstorm and the havoc it worked, and so on.The Boers never enter into theological arguments. Each and all placeimplicit faith in the Scriptural teachings, and they take for grantedeverything from the beginning to the end of their Bibles. Consequentlythe teachings of Scripture are not very firmly impressed on theirminds.When the organ begins to peal forth the voluntary, the worshipperstroop into their seats. During the choral part of the service thecongregation remain seated, and they rise when the minister prays. Theelderly gentlemen very promptly go to sleep when the text is givenout, and they lean back in their respective corners with the fullassurance that they will not be disturbed for at least an hour.Occasionally they may be gently aroused by their wives or children,whose supply of sweets has been exhausted. By the way, every Boer inthe country has one particular weakness, and that is a desire aftersweets. The young men recklessly walk into a store whenever they cometo town, and devote a portion of their capital to the purchase of'Dutch mottoes,' to which the ladies are very partial. The elderly menare not so particular in this respect.When the benediction is about to be pronounced, there is a generalscramble after hats, and the last Amen has scarcely been uttered whenthere is a rush for the doors. It seems to amount to a sort ofcompetition as to who will be first in the street.It may be interesting to pause for a moment and look at thecollections. The poorer classes besiege the stores on Saturday withanxious inquiries for 'stickeys,' i.e., threepenny-pieces. To a poorman with a large family of church-goers this matter of churchcollections is a serious business unless he can get four mites out ofa shilling, as coppers are not used in the Transvaal; but I haveknown men of good standing inquire as eagerly for the despisedthreepenny-piece. When special collections are called for, in aid of anew organ fund, for instance, the results are rather surprising. Inone instance the combined special collections on a Nachtmaal Sundayamounted to a little over L500, with a congregation of only 400. Thispoints to the fact that there is money enough in the country, and itonly requires a church collection to prove it.It is to be regretted that the Boer does not devote a little moreattention to the education of his children. If there happens to be aschool anywhere near his farm, he does not mind taking advantage ofthis with a view to 'teaching the young idea how to shoot'; butperhaps he takes too literal a view of this adage. His chief care isto see that his boys are taught to shoot straight, and he does notattach so much importance as he might to the three R's. The Boer whocan afford such luxuries engages a tutor for his children, but tutorsare mostly of the English persuasion. They have not yet learned toappreciate the language of the country, and this constitutes a seriousbarrier. Again, one does not expect much of a country school, and themajority of the men who preside over these institutions in the DutchRepublics are there simply because they can obtain no more lucrativean occupation. A number of Free State farmers invariably 'trek' toNatal with their families and stock during the winter months, and thisaffords an opportunity for placing the children at more advancedschools; but then again the objection is serious--the masters areEnglish.[Illustration: BLOEMFONTEIN.]In the town of Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, where the Volksraadthunders forth its mighty convictions, there is a model Young Ladies'College. It seems that one day recently the members of the Raad foundthemselves in want of debatable motions, and it fell to the lot of oneof their number to save the situation. That member directed theattention of his brethren to a certain question affecting the properconduct of the Young Ladies' College aforesaid. It had come to hisknowledge that the Principal of the College had granted, to certainof the pupils who desired it, permission to pray to Almighty God inthe English language. The member forcibly contended that thislamentable state of affairs should not exist, but that every pupil inthe College should be compelled to pray to God in the language of thecountry! A general discussion followed, but it was ultimately allowedthat this matter did not come within the jurisdiction of that Raad.CHAPTER IXEvery town has its Landdrost, and every town has its Landdrost'sclerk. Usually the clerk does all the work, and the Landdrost, in hiscapacity of chief magistrate, passes all the sentences and issues allthe instructions. But, then, Landdrosts, as a rule, are very agreeablepeople, possibly because they are educated and intelligent men, andhave nothing in common with the Boer.I have one particular Landdrost in my mind as I write. He was a dearold man, but he was dead against Kaffirs and natives generally. Hisfather had been killed by Kaffirs, and this fact probably rankled inhis bosom and ruled his judgments to a great extent. When he wanted toshow a little bit of leniency, as, for instance, after anextraordinarily good breakfast, he would bind the culprit over toserve in his own kitchen for a period of one year withoutremuneration. But he never did get a native to serve the full time,because the native preferred to break the law once more and go to'tronk' instead. Hard work was not in his line.He is dead now, poor man! but he was a regular type of a Landdrost. Helived a very quiet life, and the brunt of the work fell to the lot ofthe ever-willing and conscientious clerk, which arrangement allowedthe Landdrost sufficient leisure to attend to a somewhat large garden.There were fruit trees in that garden which in the fruit seasonincited every boy in town to deeds of valour, the said deedsconsisting in being able to carry away as much fruit as possiblewithout being caught in the act. For the Landdrost exercised awatchful eye over that fruit. It was currently reported, however, thathis was the first garden to be literally left desolate before theseason had far advanced, and it was usually his misfortune to bedeprived of his fruit just after he had retired for the night, afterhaving prowled about with an empty gun in his hand from sunset tilllate in the evening. It was even reported that one evening, after theold man had retired as usual, a certain person who had a strongpredilection for other people's fruit approached the Landdrost'sgarden with a handcart and a lantern, and assisted himself freelybefore taking his departure.In conclusion, and as an illustration of the moral tendencies of youngBoers generally, I shall now quote a little scene which was writtensome time ago for another purpose.In a mealie-field close to a certain farm, which shall be nameless, acurious scene was being witnessed by a very stout Dutch lady. She wasstanding at the edge of the field. Above her head myriads of locustsfloated in a darkening mass. The mealie stalks were only a foot or sohigh, but the locusts knew that they were green, and therefore good toeat, so they hovered around. The mealies were in rows, and betweenthese rows galloped half-a-dozen horses carrying half-a-dozen very rawnatives. The latter were making such a hideous noise, that it seemedto point to remarkable staying powers on the part of the locusts,inasmuch as they still persisted in trying to gain a footing. But theKaffirs cantered their steeds faster, and the noise waxed morehideous, and the fat vrouw continued to urge them to renewed andincreased effort. Round the edges of the patch four or five Kaffirwomen walked, each at a different point, and each in possession of afive-gallon empty paraffin tin and a stick, with which to strengthenand augment the noisy defence. The locusts were reinforced everyminute, and they made repeated and determined efforts to sample theyoung mealies, but the horsemen and the paraffin tins were too muchfor them.A small white boy was standing near the fat lady, watching theproceedings with a critical eye. His dress was very primitive, and hishome-made veldschoens were very large, but he was a healthy-lookingboy.'Ma,' he said at length, looking up into the fat lady's face, 'I seesomething.'This was rather a peculiar remark to make, because undoubtedly he mustsee something, not being blind.'Yes,' returned his 'ma,' without taking her eyes off the mealiepatch, 'what do you see, son?''I won't tell you, ma.''Ma' paid no particular attention to this decision on the part of hersmall son, but he continued to look into his 'ma's' face as ifuncertain about something.'Ma, I won't tell you what I see,' he continued, coming up closer tothe stout lady and catching hold of her hand.'Why won't you tell me, son?' asked 'ma,' looking down affectionatelyupon the white head of her boy.'Not until you promise me something, ma.''Well, what must I promise you?'The boy hesitated for a minute before replying. He had apparentlygrave doubts as to whether 'ma' would concede even if he did ask her.'Ma, I want to shoot Witbooi with my gun.'Witbooi was a Kaffir umfaan, who had no particular liking for hisyoung Baas.'I can't promise you that until your pa comes home, Gert,' said his'ma,' patting him lovingly on the head, and at the same time lendingher critical eye to the mealie business.The boy left his mother's side and walked away a few yards, evidentlydisgusted with unsympathetic 'mas.' Then, apparently changing hismind, he ran towards her again, and clung to her dress, meantimelooking up in her face.'I'll tell you, ma--I'll tell you,' he said laughingly.'That's a good boy,' said 'ma,' again patting him on the head.'I see waggons coming; that's it!' exclaimed the boy, running awayplayfully, and observing with evident satisfaction the look ofsurprise on his mother's face, as if it atoned somewhat for thedisappointment regarding the fate of Witbooi.Billing and Sons, Printers, Guildford***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOER IN PEACE AND WAR********** This file should be named 15561.txt or 15561.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/5/5/6/15561Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

POT-VALIANCEThen drink it thus, cried the rash young fool, and splashed the contentsof his cup full into the face of Mr. Wilding even as that gentleman, onhis feet, was proposing to drink to the eyes of the young fool's sister.The moments that followed were full of interest. A stillness, abrooding, expectant stillness, fell upon the company--and it numbereda round dozen--about Lord Gervase's richly appointed board. In the softcandlelight the oval table shone like a deep brown pool, in which werereflected the gleaming silver and sparkling crystal that seemed to floatupon it.Blake sucked in his nether-lip, his florid face a thought less floridthan its wont, his prominent blue eyes a thought more prominent. Underits golden periwig old Nick Trenchard's wizened countenance was darkenedby a scowl, and his fingers, long, swarthy, and gnarled, drummedfretfully upon the table. Portly Lord Gervase Scoresby--their host, abenign and placid man of peace, detesting turbulence--turned crimson nowin wordless rage. The others gaped and stared--some at young Westmacott,some at the man he had so grossly affronted--whilst in the shadows ofthe hall a couple of lacqueys looked on amazed, all teeth and eyes.Mr. Wilding stood, very still and outwardly impassive, the winetrickling from his long face, which, if pale, was no paler than itshabit, a vestige of the smile with which he had proposed the toast stilllingering on his thin lips, though departed from his eyes. An elegantgentleman was Mr. Wilding, tall, and seeming even taller by virtue ofhis exceeding slenderness. He had the courage to wear his own hair,which was of a dark brown and very luxuriant; dark brown too were hissombre eyes, low-lidded and set at a downward slant. From those odd eyesof his, his countenance gathered an air of superciliousness tempered bya gentle melancholy. For the rest, it was scored by lines that stampedit with the appearance of an age in excess of his thirty years.Thirty guineas' worth of Mechlin at his throat was drenched, empurpledand ruined beyond redemption, and on the breast of his blue satin coat adark patch was spreading like a stain of blood.Richard Westmacott, short, sturdy, and fair-complexioned to the pointof insipidity, watched him sullenly out of pale eyes, and waited. Itwas Lord Gervase who broke at last the silence--broke it with an oath, athing unusual in one whose nature was almost woman-mild."As God's my life!" he spluttered wrathfully, glowering at Richard. "Tohave this happen in my house! The young fool shall make apology!""With his dying breath," sneered Trenchard, and the old rake's words,his tone, and the malevolent look he bent upon the boy increased thecompany's malaise."I think," said Mr. Wilding, with a most singular and excessivesweetness, "that what Mr. Westmacott has done he has done because heapprehended me amiss.""No doubt he'll say so," opined Trenchard with a shrug, and had cautiondug into his ribs by Blake's elbow, whilst Richard made haste to provehim wrong by saying the contrary."I apprehended you exactly, sir," he answered, defiance in his voice andwine-flushed face."Ha!" clucked Trenchard, irrepressible. "He's bent on self-destruction.Let him have his way, in God's name."But Wilding seemed intent upon showing how long-suffering he couldbe. He gently shook his head. "Nay, now," said he. "You thought, Mr.Westmacott, that in mentioning your sister, I did so lightly. Is it notso?""You mentioned her, and that is all that matters," cried Westmacott."I'll not have her name on your lips at any time or in any place--no,nor in any manner." His speech was thick from too much wine."You are drunk," cried indignant Lord Gervase with finality."Pot-valiant," Trenchard elaborated.Mr. Wilding set down at last the glass which he had continued tohold until that moment. He rested his hands upon the table, knucklesdownward, and leaning forward he spoke impressively, his face verygrave; and those present--knowing him as they did--were one and all lostin wonder at his unusual patience."Mr. Westmacott," said he, "I do think you are wrong to persist inaffronting me. You have done a thing that is beyond forgiveness, andyet, when I offer you this opportunity of honourably retrieving..." Heshrugged his shoulders, leaving the sentence incomplete.The company might have spared its deep surprise at so much mildness.There was but the semblance of it. Wilding proceeded thus of purposeset, and under the calm mask of his long white face his mind workedwickedly and deliberately. The temerity of Westmacott, whose nature wasnotoriously timid, had surprised him for a moment. But anon, reading theboy's mind as readily as though it had been a scroll unfolded for hisinstruction, he saw that Westmacott, on the strength of his positionas his sister's brother, conceived himself immune. Mr. Wilding's avowedcourtship of the lady, the hopes he still entertained of winning her,despite the aversion she was at pains to show him, gave Westmacottassurance that Mr. Wilding would never elect to shatter his all tooslender chances by embroiling himself in a quarrel with her brother.And--reading him, thus, aright--Mr. Wilding put on that mask ofpatience, luring the boy into greater conviction of the security ofhis position. And Richard, conceiving himself safe in his entrenchmentbehind the bulwarks of his brothership to Ruth Westmacott, and heartenedfurther by the excess of wine he had consumed, persisted in insults hewould never otherwise have dared to offer."Who seeks to retrieve?" he crowed offensively, boldly looking up intothe other's face. "It seems you are yourself reluctant." And he laugheda trifle stridently, and looked about him for applause, but found none."You are overrash," Lord Gervase disapproved him harshly."Not the first coward I've seen grow valiant at a table," put inTrenchard by way of explanation, and might have come to words with Blakeon that same score, but that in that moment Wilding spoke again."Reluctant to do what?" he questioned amiably, looking Westmacottso straightly between the eyes that the boy shifted uneasily on hishigh-backed chair.Nevertheless, still full of confidence in the unassailability of hisposition, the mad youth answered, "To cleanse yourself of what I threwat you.""Fan me, ye winds!" gasped Nick Trenchard, and looked with expectancy athis friend Wilding.Now there was one factor with which, in basing with such cravenshrewdness his calculations upon Mr. Wilding's feelings for his sister,young Richard had not reckoned. He was not to know that Wilding,bruised and wounded by Miss Westmacott's scorn of him, had reached thatborderland where love and hate are so merged that they are scarce to bedistinguished. Embittered by the slights she had put upon him--slightswhich his sensitive, lover's fancy had magnified a hundredfold--AnthonyWilding's frame of mind was grown peculiar. Of his love she would havenone; his kindness she seemingly despised. So be it; she should tastehis cruelty. If she scorned his wooing and forbade him to pursue it, atleast it was not hers to deny him the power to hurt; and in hurtingher that would not be loved by him some measure of fierce and bitterconsolation seemed to await him.He realized, perhaps, not quite all this--and to the unworthiness of itall he gave no thought. But he realized enough as he toyed, as cat withmouse, with Richard Westmacott, to know that in striking at her throughthe worthless person of this brother whom she cherished--and whopersisted in affording him this opportunity--a wicked vengeance would behis.Peace-loving Lord Gervase had heaved himself suddenly to his feet atWestmacott's last words, still intent upon saving the situation."In Heaven's name..." he began, when Mr. Wilding, ever calm and smiling,though now a trifle sinister, waved him gently into silence. But thatpersisting calm of Mr. Wilding's was too much for old Nick Trenchard. Herose abruptly, drawing all eyes upon himself. It was time, he thought,he took a hand in this.In addition to his affection for Wilding and his contempt forWestmacott, he was filled with a fear that the latter might becomedangerous if not crushed at once. Gifted with a shrewd knowledge ofmen, acquired during a chequered life of much sour experience, oldNick instinctively mistrusted Richard. He had known him for a fool,a weakling, a babbler, and a bibber of wine. Out of such elements avillain is soon compounded, and Trenchard had cause to fear the formof villainy that lay ready to Richard's hand. For it chanced that Mr.Trenchard was second cousin to that famous John Trenchard, so latelytried for treason and acquitted to the great joy of the sectaries of theWest, and still more lately--but yesterday, in fact--fled the country toescape the rearrest ordered in consequence of that excessive joy. Likehis more famous cousin, Nick Trenchard was one of the Duke of Monmouth'smost active agents; and Westmacott, like Wilding, Vallancey, and oneor two others at that board, stood, too, committed to the cause of theProtestant Champion.Out of his knowledge of the boy Trenchard was led to fear that if hewere leniently dealt with now, tomorrow, when, sober, he came to realizethe grossness of the thing he had done and the unlikelihood of its beingforgiven him, there was no saying but that to protect himself he mightbetray Wilding's share in the plot that was being hatched. That initself would be bad enough; but there might be worse, for he couldscarcely betray Wilding without betraying others and--what matteredmost--the Cause itself. He must be dealt with out of hand, Trenchardopined, and dealt with ruthlessly."I think, Anthony," said he, "that we have had words enough. Shall yoube disposing of Mr. Westmacott to-morrow, or must I be doing it foryou?"With a gasp of dismay young Richard twisted in his chair to confrontthis fresh and unsuspected antagonist. What danger was this that he hadoverlooked? Then, even as he turned, Wilding's voice fell on his ear,and each word of the few he spoke was like a drop of icy water onWestmacott's overheated brain."I protest you are vastly kind, Nick. But I intend, myself, to have thepleasure of killing Mr. Westmacott." And his smile fell now in mockeryupon the disillusioned lad.Crushed by that bolt from the blue, Richard sat as if stunned, the flushreceding from his face until his very lips were livid. The shock hadsobered him, and, sobered, he realized in terror what he had done. Andyet even sober he was amazed to find that the staff upon which with suchsecurity he had leaned should have proved rotten. True he had put muchstrain upon it; but then he had counted that it would stand much strain.He would have spoken, but he lacked words, so stricken was he. And evenhad he done so it is odds none would have heard him, for the late calmwas of a sudden turned to garboil. Every man of that company--withthe sole exception of Richard himself--was on his feet, and all werespeaking at once, in clamouring, excited chorus.Wilding alone--the butt of their expostulations--stood quietly smiling,and wiped his face at last with a kerchief of finest lawn. Dominatingthe others in the Babel rose the voice of Sir Rowland Blake--impecuniousBlake; Blake lately of the Guards, who had sold his commission as theonly thing remaining him upon which he could raise money; Blake, thatother suitor for Miss Westmacott's hand, the suitor favoured by herbrother."You shall not do it, Mr. Wilding," he shouted, his face crimson. "No,by God! You were shamed forever. He is but a lad, and drunk."Trenchard eyed the short, powerfully built man beside him, and laughedunpleasantly. "You should get yourself bled one of these days, SirRowland," he advised. "There may be no great danger yet; but a man can'tbe too careful when he wears a narrow neckcloth."Blake--a short, powerfully built man--took no heed of him, but lookedstraight at Mr. Wilding, who, smiling ever, calmly returned the gaze ofthose prominent blue eyes."You will suffer me, Sir Rowland," said he sweetly, "to be the judge ofwhom I will and whom I will not meet."Sir Rowland flushed under that mocking glance and caustic tone. "But heis drunk," he repeated feebly."I think," said Trenchard, "that he is hearing something that will makehim sober."Lord Gervase took the lad by the shoulder, and shook him impatiently."Well?" quoth he. "Have you nothing to say? You did a deal of pratingjust now. I make no doubt but that even at this late hour if you were tomake apology...""It would be idle," came Wilding's icy voice to quench the gleam of hopekindling anew in Richard's breast. The lad saw that he was lost, and heis a poor thing, indeed, who cannot face the worst once that worst isshown to be irrevocable. He rose with some semblance of dignity."It is as I would wish," said he, but his livid face and staring eyesbelied the valour of his words. He cleared his huskiness from histhroat. "Sir Rowland," said he, "will you act for me?""Not I!" cried Blake with an oath. "I'll be no party to the butchery ofa boy unfledged.""Unfledged?" echoed Trenchard. "Body o' me! 'Tis a matter Wilding willamend to-morrow. He'll fledge him, never fear. He'll wing him on hisflight to heaven."Of set purpose did Trenchard add this fuel to the blazing fire. It wasno part of his views that this encounter should be avoided. If RichardWestmacott were allowed to live after what had passed, there were toomany tall fellows might go in peril of their lives.Richard, meanwhile, had turned to the man on his left--young Vallancey,a notorious partisan of the Duke of Monmouth's, a hair-brained gentlemanwho was his own worst enemy."May I count on you, Ned?" he asked."Aye--to the death," said Vallancey magniloquently."Mr. Vallancey," said Trenchard with a wry twist of his sharp features,"you grow prophetic."CHAPTER II. SIR ROWLAND TO THE RESCUEFrom Scoresby Hall, near Weston Zoyland, young Westmacott rode home thatSaturday night to his sister's house in Bridgwater, a sobered man and ananguished. He had committed a folly which was like to cost him his lifeto-morrow. Other follies had he committed in his twenty-five years--forhe was not quite the babe that Blake had represented him, although hecertainly looked nothing like his age. But to-night he had contrived toset the crown to all. He had good cause to blame himself and to cursethe miscalculation that had emboldened him to launch himself upona course of insult against this Wilding, whom he hated with all thecurrish and resentful hatred of the worthless for the man of parts.But there was more than hate in the affront that he had offered;there was calculation--to an even greater extent than we have seen. Ithappened that through his own fault young Richard was all but penniless.The pious, nonconformist soul of Sir Geoffrey Lupton--the wealthy unclefrom whom he had had great expectations--had been so stirred to anger byRichard's vicious and besotted ways that he had left every guinea thatwas his, every perch of land, and every brick of edifice to Richard'shalf-sister Ruth. At present things were not so bad for the worthlessboy. Ruth worshipped him. He was a sacred charge to her from their deadfather, who, knowing the stoutness of her soul and the feebleness ofRichard's, had in dying imposed on her the care and guidance of hergraceless brother. But Ruth, in all things strong, was weak with Richardout of her very fondness for him. To what she had he might help himself,and thus it was that things were not so bad with him at present. Butwhen Richard's calculating mind came to give thought to the future hefound that this occasioned him some care. Rich ladies, even when theydo not happen to be equipped in addition with Ruth's winsome beauty andendearing nature, are not wont to go unmarried. It would have pleasedRichard best to have had her remain a spinster. But he well knew thatthis was a matter in which she might have a voice of her own, and itbehoved him betimes to take wise measures where possible husbands wereconcerned.The first that came in a suitor's obvious panoply was Anthony Wilding,of Zoyland Chase, and Richard watched his advent with foreboding.Wilding's was a personality to dazzle any woman, despite--perhaps evenbecause of--the reputation for wildness that clung to him. That he wasknown as Wild Wilding to the countryside is true; but it were unfair--asRichard knew--to attach to this too much importance; for the adoptionof so obvious an alliteration the rude country minds needed but a slightencouragement. From the first it looked as if Ruth might favour him, andRichard's fears assumed more definite shape. If Wilding married her--andhe was a bold, masterful fellow who usually accomplished what he aimedat--her fortune and estate must cease to be a pleasant pasture land forbovine Richard. The boy thought at first of making terms with Wilding;the idea was old; it had come to him when first he had counted thechances of his sister's marrying. But he found himself hesitating tolay his proposal before Mr. Wilding. And whilst he hesitated Mr.Wilding made obvious headway. Still Richard dared not do it. There wasa something in Wilding's eye that cried him danger. Thus, in the end,since he could not attempt a compromise with this fine fellow, the onlycourse remaining was that of direct antagonism--that is to say, directas Richard understood directness. Slander was the weapon he used inthat secret duel; the countryside was well stocked with stories of Mr.Wilding's many indiscretions. I do not wish to suggest that these wereunfounded. Still, the countryside, cajoled by its primitive sense ofhumour into that alliteration I have mentioned, found that having giventhis dog its bad name, it was under the obligation of keeping up hisreputation. So it exaggerated. Richard, exaggerating those exaggerationsin his turn, had some details, as interesting and unsavoury as they werein the main untrue, to lay before his sister.Now established love, it is well known, thrives wondrously on slander.The robust growth of a maid's feelings for her accepted suitor is butfurther strengthened by malign representations of his character. Sheseizes with joy the chance of affording proof of her great loyalty, anddefies the world and its evil to convince her that the man to whom shehas given her trust is not most worthy of it. Not so, however, with thefirst timid bud of incipient interest. Slander nips it like a frost; indeadliness it is second only to ridicule.Ruth Westmacott lent an ear to her brother's stories, incredulous onlyuntil she remembered vague hints she had caught from this person andfrom that, whose meaning was now made clear by what Richard told her,which, incidentally, they served to corroborate. Corroboration, too, didthe tale of infamy receive from the friendship that prevailed betweenMr. Wilding and Nick Trenchard, the old ne'er-dowell, who in histime--as everybody knew--had come so low, despite his gentle birth, asto have been one of a company of strolling players. Had Mr. Wildingbeen other than she now learnt he was, he would surely not cherish anattachment for a person so utterly unworthy. Clearly, they were birds ofa plumage.And so, her maiden purity outraged at the thought that she had been indanger of lending a willing ear to the wooing of such a man, shehad crushed this love which she blushed to think was on the point ofthrowing out roots to fasten on her soul, and was sedulous thereafter inmanifesting the aversion which she accounted it her duty to foster forMr. Wilding.Richard had watched and smiled in secret, taking pride in the cunningway he had wrought this change--that cunning which so often is givento the stupid by way of compensation for the intelligence that has beenwithheld them.And now what time discountenanced, Wilding fumed and fretted all invain, Sir Rowland Blake, fresh from London and in full flight from hiscreditors, flashed like a comet into the Bridgwater heavens. He dazzledthe eyes and might have had for the asking the heart and hand of DianaHorton--Ruth's cousin. Her heart, indeed, he had without the asking, forDiana fell straightway in love with him and showed it, just as he showedthat he was not without response to her affection. There were sometender passages between them; but Blake, for all his fine exterior, wasa beggar, and Diana far from rich, and so he rode his feelings witha hard grip upon the reins. And then, in an evil hour for poor Diana,young Westmacott had taken him to Lupton House, and Sir Rowland had hisfirst glimpse of Ruth, his first knowledge of her fortune. He went downbefore Ruth's eyes like a man of heart; he went down more lowly stillbefore her possessions like a man of greed; and poor Diana might consoleherself with whom she could.Her brother watched him, appraised him, and thought that in this brokengamester he had a man after his own heart; a man who would be readyenough for such a bargain as Richard had in mind; ready enough tosell what rags might be left him of his honour so that he came by thewherewithal to mend his broken fortunes.The twain made terms. They haggled like any pair of traders out ofJewry, but in the end it was settled--by a bond duly engrossed andsealed--that on the day that Sir Rowland married Ruth he should makeover to her brother certain values that amounted to perhaps a quarter ofher possessions. There was no cause to think that Ruth would be greatlyopposed to this--not that that consideration would have weighed withRichard.But now that all essentials were so satisfactorily determined a vexationwas offered Westmacott by the circumstance that his sister seemed nowisetaken with Sir Rowland. She suffered him because he was her brother'sfriend; on that account she even honoured him with some measure of herown friendship; but to no greater intimacy did her manner promise toadmit him. And meanwhile, Mr. Wilding persisted in the face of allrebuffs. Under his smiling mask he hid the smart of the wounds she dealthim, until it almost seemed to him that from loving her he had come tohate her.It had been well for Richard had he left things as they were and waited.Whether Blake prospered or not, leastways it was clear that Wildingwould not prosper, and that, for the season, was all that need havemattered to young Richard.But in his cups that night he had thought in some dim way to precipitatematters by affronting Mr. Wilding, secure, as I have shown, in hisbelief that Wilding would perish sooner than raise a finger againstRuth's brother. And his drunken astuteness, it seemed, had been tohis mind as a piece of bottle glass to the sight, distorting the imageviewed through it.With some such bitter reflection rode he home to his sleepless couch.Some part of those dark hours he spent in bitter reviling of Wilding, ofhimself, and even of his sister, whom he blamed for this awful situationinto which he had tumbled; at other times he wept from self-pity andsheer fright.Once, indeed, he imagined that he saw light, that he saw a way outof the peril that hemmed him in. His mind turned for a moment in thedirection that Trenchard had feared it might. He bethought him of hisassociation with the Monmouth Cause--into which he had been beguiled bythe sordid hope of gain--and of Wilding's important share in that samebusiness. He was even moved to rise and ride that very night for Exeterto betray to Albemarle the Cause itself, so that he might have Wildinglaid by the heels. But if Trenchard had been right in having littlefaith in Richard's loyalty, he had, it seems, in fearing treacherymade the mistake of giving Richard credit for more courage than was hisendowment. For when, sitting up in bed, fired by his inspiration, youngWestmacott came to consider the questions the Lord-Lieutenant of Devonwould be likely to ask him, he reflected that the answers he must returnwould so incriminate himself that he would be risking his own neck inthe betrayal. He flung himself down again with a curse and a groan, andthought no more of the salvation that might lie for him that way.The morning of that last day of May found him pale and limp and alla-tremble. He rose betimes and dressed, but stirred not from his chambertill in the garden under his window he heard his sister's voice, andthat of Diana Horton, joined anon by a man's deeper tones, which herecognized with a start as Blake's. What did the baronet here soearly? Assuredly it must concern the impending duel. Richard knew nomawkishness on the score of eavesdropping. He stole to his window andlent an ear, but the voices were receding, and to his vexation he caughtnothing of what was said. He wondered how soon Vallancey would come, andfor what hour the encounter had been appointed. Vallancey had remainedbehind at Scoresby Hall last night to make the necessary arrangementswith Trenchard, who was to act for Mr. Wilding.Now it chanced that Trenchard and Wilding had business--business ofMonmouth's--to transact in Taunton that morning; business which mightnot be delayed. There were odd rumours afloat in the West; persistentrumours which had come fast upon the heels of the news of Argyle'slanding in Scotland; rumours which maintained that Monmouth himself wascoming over from Holland. These tales Wilding and his associates hadignored. The Duke, they knew, was to spend the summer in retreat inSweden, with (it was alleged) the Lady Henrietta Wentworth to bear himcompany, and in the mean time his trusted agents were to pave the wayfor his coming in the following spring. Of late the lack of direct newsfrom the Duke had been a source of mystification to his friends in theWest, and now, suddenly, the information went abroad--it was somethingmore than rumour this time--that a letter of the greatest importancehad been intercepted. From whom that letter proceeded or to whom it wasaddressed, could not yet be discovered. But it seemed clear that itwas connected with the Monmouth Cause, and it behoved Mr. Wilding todiscover what he could. With this intent he rode with Trenchard thatSunday morning to Taunton, hoping that at the Red Lion Inn--thatmeeting-place of dissenters--he might cull reliable information.It was in consequence of this that the meeting with Richard Westmacottwas not to take place until the evening, and therefore Vallancey camenot to Lupton House as early as Richard thought he should expect him.Blake, however--more no doubt out of a selfish fear of losing a valuedally in the winning of Ruth's hand than out of any excessive concern forRichard himself--had risen early and hastened to Lupton House, in thehope, which he recognized as all but forlorn, of yet being able to avertthe disaster he foresaw for Richard.Peering over the orchard wall as he rode by, he caught a glimpse,through an opening between the trees, of Ruth herself and Diana on thelawn beyond. There was a wicket gate that stood unlatched, and availinghimself of this Sir Rowland tethered his horse in the lane and threadinghis way briskly through the orchard came suddenly upon the girls.Their laughter reached him as he advanced, and told him they could knownothing yet of Richard's danger.On his abrupt and unexpected apparition, Diana paled and Ruth flushedslightly, whereupon Sir Rowland might have bethought him, had he beenbook-learned, of the axiom, "Amour qui rougit, fleurette; amour quiplit, drame du coeur."He doffed his hat and bowed, his fair ringlets tumbling forward tillthey hid his face, which was exceeding grave.Ruth gave him good morning pleasantly. "You London folk are earlierrisers than we are led to think," she added."'Twill be the change of air makes Sir Rowland matutinal," said Diana,making a gallant recovery from her agitation."I vow," said he, "that I had grown matutinal earlier had I known whathere awaited me.""Awaited you?" quoth Diana, and tossed her head archly disdainful. "La!Sir Rowland, your modesty will be the death of you." Archness becamethis lady of the sunny hair, tip-tilted nose, and complexion thatoutvied the apple-blossoms. She was shorter by a half-head than herdarker cousin, and made up in sprightliness what she lacked of Ruth'sgentle dignity. The pair were foils, each setting off the graces of theother."I protest I am foolish," answered Blake, a shade discomfited. "But Iwant not for excuse. I have it in the matter that brings me here."So solemn was his air, so sober his voice, that both girls felt apremonition of the untoward message that he bore. It was Ruth who askedhim to explain himself."Will you walk, ladies?" said Blake, and waved the hand that still heldhis hat riverwards, adown the sloping lawn. They moved away together,Sir Rowland pacing between his love of yesterday and his love of to-day,pressed with questions from both. He shaded his eyes to look at theriver, dazzling in the morning sunlight that came over Polden Hill, and,standing thus, he unburdened himself at last."My news concerns Richard and--Mr. Wilding." They looked at him.Miss Westmacott's fine level brows were knit. He paused to ask, as ifsuddenly observing his absence, "Is Richard not yet risen?""Not yet," said Ruth, and waited for him to proceed."It does credit to his courage that he should sleep late on such a day,"said Blake, and was pleased with the adroitness wherewith he broke thenews. "He quarrelled last night with Anthony Wilding."Ruth's hand went to her bosom; fear stared at Blake from out her eyes,blue as the heavens overhead; a grey shade overcast the usual warmpallor of her face."With Mr. Wilding?" she cried. "That man!" And though she said no moreher eyes implored him to go on, and tell her what more there might be.He did so, and he spared not Wilding. The task, indeed, was one to whichhe applied himself with a certain zest; whatever might be the outcomeof the affair, there was no denying that he was by way of reaping profitfrom it by the final overthrow of an acknowledged rival. And when hetold her how Richard had flung his wine in Wilding's face when Wildingstood to toast her, a faint flush crept to her cheeks."Richard did well," said she. "I am proud of him."The words pleased Sir Rowland vastly; but he reckoned without Diana.Miss Horton's mind was illumined by her knowledge of herself. In thelight of that she saw precisely what capital this tale-bearer sought tomake. The occasion might not be without its opportunities for her; andto begin with, it was no part of her intention that Wilding should bethus maligned and finally driven from the lists of rivalry with Blake.Upon Wilding, indeed, and his notorious masterfulness did she found whathopes she still entertained of winning back Sir Rowland."Surely," said she, "you are a little hard on Mr. Wilding. You speak asif he were the first gallant that ever toasted lady's eyes.""I am no lady of his, Diana," Ruth reminded her, with a faint show ofheat.Diana shrugged her shoulders. "You may not love him, but you can'tordain that he shall not love you. You are very harsh, I think. To me itrather seems that Richard acted like a boor.""But, mistress," cried Sir Rowland, half out of countenance, andstifling his vexation, "in these matters it all depends upon themanner.""Why, yes," she agreed; "and whatever Mr. Wilding's manner, if I knowhim at all, it would be nothing but respectful to the last degree.""My own conception of respect," said he, "is not to bandy a lady's nameabout a company of revellers.""Bethink you, though, you said just now, it all depended on the manner,"she rejoined. Sir Rowland shrugged and turned half from her to herlistening cousin. When all is said, poor Diana appears--despite hercunning--to have been short-sighted. Aiming at a defined advantagein the game she played, she either ignored or held too lightly theconcomitant disadvantage of vexing Blake."It were perhaps best to tell us the exact words he used, Sir Rowland,"she suggested, "that for ourselves we may judge how far he lackedrespect.""What signify the words!" cried Blake, now almost out of temper."I don't recall them. It is the air with which he pledged MistressWestmacott.""Ah yes--the manner," quoth Diana irritatingly. "We'll let that be.Richard threw his wine in Mr. Wilding's face? What followed then? Whatsaid Mr. Wilding?"Sir Rowland remembered what Mr. Wilding had said, and bethought himthat it were impolitic in him to repeat it. At the same time, not havinglooked for this cross-questioning, he was all unprepared with any likelyanswer. He hesitated, until Ruth echoed Diana's question."Tell us, Sir Rowland," she begged him, "what Mr. Wilding said."Being forced to say something, and being by nature slow-witted andsluggish of invention, Sir Rowland was compelled, to his unspeakablechagrin, to fall back upon the truth."Is not that proof?" cried Diana in triumph. "Mr. Wilding was reluctantto quarrel with Richard. He was even ready to swallow such an affrontas that, thinking it might be offered him under a misconception of hismeaning. He plainly professed the respect that filled him for MistressWestmacott, and yet, and yet, Sir Rowland, you tell us that he lackedrespect!""Madam," cried Blake, turning crimson, "that matters nothing. It was notthe place or time to introduce your cousin's name."You think, Sir Rowland," put in Ruth, her air grave, judicial almost,"that Richard behaved well?""As I would like to behave myself, as I would have a son of mine behaveon the like occasion," Blake protested. "But we waste words," he cried."I did not come to defend Richard, nor just to bear you this untowardnews. I came to consult with you, in the hope that we might find someway to avert this peril from your brother.""What way is possible?" asked Ruth, and sighed. "I would not... I wouldnot have Richard a coward.""Would you prefer him dead?" asked Blake, sadly grave."Sooner than craven--yes," Ruth answered him, very white."There is no question of that," was Blake's rejoinder. "The questionis that Wilding said last night that he would kill the boy, and whatWilding says he does. Out of the affection that I bear Richard is bornmy anxiety to save him despite himself. It is in this that I come toseek your aid or offer mine. Allied we might accomplish what singlyneither of us could."He had at once the reward of his cunning speech. Ruth held out herhands. "You are a good friend, Sir Rowland," she said, with a palesmile; and pale too was the smile with which Diana watched them. No morethan Ruth did she suspect the sincerity of Blake's protestations."I am proud you should account me that," said the baronet, taking Ruth'shands and holding them a moment; "and I would that I could prove myselfyour friend in this to some good purpose. Believe me, if Wilding wouldconsent that I might take your brother's place, I would gladly do so."It was a safe boast, knowing as he did that Wilding would consent tono such thing; but it earned him a glance of greater kindliness fromRuth--who began to think that hitherto perhaps she had done him someinjustice--and a look of greater admiration from Diana, who saw in himher beau-ideal of the gallant lover."I would not have you endanger yourself so," said Ruth."It might," said Blake, his blue eyes very fierce, "be no great danger,after all." And then dismissing that part of the subject as if, likea brave man, the notion of being thought boastful were unpleasant, hepassed on to the discussion of ways and means by which the coming duelmight be averted. But when they came to grips with facts, it seemed thatSir Rowland had as little idea of what might be done as had the ladies.True, he began by making the obvious suggestion that Richard shouldtender Wilding a full apology. That, indeed, was the only door ofescape, and Blake shrewdly suspected that what the boy had beenunwilling to do last night--partly through wine, and partly throughthe fear of looking fearful in the eyes of Lord Gervase Scoresby'sguests--he might be willing enough to do to-day, sober and uponreflection. For the rest Blake was as far from suspecting Mr. Wilding'speculiar frame of mind as had Richard been last night. This his wordsshowed."I am satisfied," said he, "that if Richard were to go to-day to Wildingand express his regret for a thing done in the heat of wine, Wildingwould be forced to accept it as satisfaction, and none would think thatit did other than reflect credit upon Richard.""Are you very sure of that?" asked Ruth, her tone dubious, her glancehopefully anxious."What else is to be thought?""But," put in Diana shrewdly, "it were an admission of Richard's that hehad done wrong.""No less," he agreed, and Ruth caught her breath in fresh dismay."And yet you have said that he did as you would have a son of yours do,"Diana reminded him."And I maintain it," answered Blake; his wits worked slowly ever. It wasfor Ruth to reveal the flaw to him."Do you not understand, then," she asked him sadly, "that such anadmission on Richard's part would amount to a lie--a lie uttered to savehimself from an encounter, the worst form of lie, a lie of cowardice?Surely, Sir Rowland, your kindly anxiety for his life outruns youranxiety for his honour."Diana, having accomplished her task, hung her head in silence,pondering.Sir Rowland was routed utterly. He glanced from one to the other of hiscompanions, and grew afraid that he--the town gallant--might come tolook foolish in the eyes of these country ladies. He protested againhis love for Richard, and increased Ruth's terror by his mention ofWilding's swordsmanship; but when all was said, he saw that he had bestretreat ere he spoiled the good effect which he hoped his solicitude hadcreated. And so he spoke of seeking counsel with Lord Gervase Scoresby,and took his leave, promising to return by noon.CHAPTER III. DIANA SCHEMESNotwithstanding the brave face Ruth Westmacott had kept during hispresence, when he departed Sir Rowland left behind him a distressamounting almost to anguish in her mind. Yet though she might suffer,there was no weakness in Ruth's nature. She knew how to endure. Diana,bearing Richard not a tenth of the affection his sister consecrated tohim, was alarmed for him. Besides, her own interests urged the avertingof this encounter. And so she held in accents almost tearful thatsomething must be done to save him.This, too, appeared to be Richard's own view, when presently--within afew minutes of Blake's departure--he came to join them. They watchedhis approach in silence, and both noted--though with different eyes anddifferent feelings--the pallor of his fair face, the dark lines underhis colourless eyes. His condition was abject, and his manners, neverof the best--for there was much of the spoiled child about Richard--wereclearly suffering from it.He stood before his sister and his cousin, moving his eyes shiftily fromone to the other, rubbing his hands nervously together."Your precious friend Sir Rowland has been here," said he, and it wasnot clear from his manner which of them he addressed. "Not a doubt buthe will have brought you the news." He seemed to sneer.Ruth advanced towards him, her face grave, her sweet eyes full ofpitying concern. She placed a hand upon his sleeve. "My poor Richard..."she began, but he shook off her kindly touch, laughing angrily--a merecackle of irritability."Odso!" he interrupted her. "It is a thought late for this mockkindliness!"Diana, in the background, arched her brows, then with a shrug turnedaside and seated herself on the stone seat by which they had beenstanding. Ruth shrank back as if her brother had struck her."Richard!" she cried, and searched his livid face with her eyes."Richard!"He read a question in the interjection, and he answered it. "Had youknown any real care, any true concern for me, you had not given causefor this affair," he chid her peevishly."What are you saying?" she cried, and it occurred to her at last thatRichard was afraid. He was a coward! She felt as she would faint."I am saying," said he, hunching his shoulders, and shivering as hespoke, yet, his glance unable to meet hers, "that it is your fault thatI am like to get my throat cut before sunset.""My fault?" she murmured. The slope of lawn seemed to wave and swimabout her. "My fault?""The fault of your wanton ways," he accused her harshly. "You have soplayed fast and loose with this fellow Wilding that he makes free ofyour name in my very presence, and puts upon me the need to get myselfkilled by him to save the family honour."He would have said more in this strain, but something in her glance gavehim pause. There fell a silence. From the distance came the melodiouspealing of church bells. High overhead a lark was pouring out its song;in the lane at the orchard end rang the beat of trotting hoofs. Itwas Diana who spoke presently. Just indignation stirred her, and, whenstirred, she knew no pity, set no limits to her speech."I think, indeed," said she, her voice crisp and merciless, "that thefamily honour will best be saved if Mr. Wilding kills you. It is indanger while you live. You are a coward, Richard.""Diana!" he thundered--he could be mighty brave with women--whilst Ruthclutched her arm to restrain her.But she continued, undeterred: "You are a coward--a pitiful coward," shetold him. "Consult your mirror. It will tell you what a palsied thingyou are. That you should dare so speak to Ruth...""Don't!" Ruth begged her, turning."Aye," growled Richard, "she had best be silent."Diana rose, to battle, her cheeks crimson. "It asks a braver man thanyou to compel my obedience," she told him. "La!" she fumed, "I'll swearthat had Mr. Wilding overheard what you have said to your sister, youwould have little to fear from his sword. A cane would be the weaponhe'd use on you."Richard's pale eyes flamed malevolently; a violent rage possessed himand flooded out his fear, for nothing can so goad a man as an offensivetruth. Ruth approached him again; again she took him by the arm, seekingto soothe his over-troubled spirit; but again he shook her off. And thento save the situation came a servant from the house. So lost in angerwas all Richard's sense of decency that the mere supervention of theman would not have been enough to have silenced him could he have foundadequate words in which to answer Mistress Horton. But even as he rackedhis mind, the footman's voice broke the silence, and the words thefellow uttered did what his presence alone might not have sufficed todo."Mr. Vallancey is asking for you, sir," he announced.Richard started. Vallancey! He had come at last, and his coming wasconnected with the impending duel. The thought was paralyzing to youngWestmacott. The flush of anger faded from his face; its leaden huereturned and he shivered as with cold. At last he mastered himselfsufficiently to ask:"Where is he, Jasper?""In the library, sir," replied the servant. "Shall I bring him hither?""Yes--no," he answered. "I will come to him." He turned his back uponthe ladies, paused a moment, still irresolute. Then, as by an effort,he followed the servant across the lawn and vanished through the iviedporch.As he went Diana flew to her cousin. Her shallow nature was touched withtransient pity. "My poor Ruth..." she murmured soothingly, and set herarm about the other's waist. There was a gleam of tears in the eyes Ruthturned upon her. Together they came to the granite seat and sank to itside by side, fronting the placid river. There Ruth, her elbows on herknees, cradled her chin in her hands, and with a sigh of misery staredstraight before her."It was untrue!" she said at last. "What Richard said of me was untrue.""Why, yes," Diana snapped, contemptuous. "The only truth is that Richardis afraid."Ruth shivered. "Ah, no," she pleaded--she knew how true was theimpeachment. "Don't say it, Diana.""It matters little that I say it," snorted Diana impatiently. "It is atruth proclaimed by the first glance at him.""He is in poor health, perhaps," said Ruth, seeking miserably to excusehim."Aye," said Diana. "He's suffering from an ague--the result of a lackof courage. That he should so have spoken to you! Give me patience,Heaven!"Ruth crimsoned again at the memory of his words; a wave of indignationswept through her gentle soul, but was gone at once, leaving anineffable sadness in its room. What was to be done? She turned to Dianafor counsel. But Diana was still whipping up her scorn."If he goes out to meet Mr. Wilding, he'll shame himself and every manand woman that bears the name of Westmacott," said she, and struck a newfear with that into the heart of Ruth."He must not go!" she answered passionately. "He must not meet him!"Diana flashed her a sidelong glance. "And if he doesn't, will things bemended?" she inquired. "Will it save his honour to have Mr. Wilding comeand cane him?""He'd not do that?" said Ruth."Not if you asked him--no," was Diana's sharp retort, and she caught herbreath on the last word of it, for just then the Devil dropped the seedof a suggestion into the fertile soil of her lovesick soul."Diana!" Ruth exclaimed in reproof, turning to confront her cousin. ButDiana's mind started upon its scheming journey was now travelling fast.Out of that devil's seed there sprang with amazing rapidity a tree-likegrowth, throwing out branches, putting forth leaves, bearing already--inher fancy--bloom and fruit."Why not?" quoth she after a breathing space, and her voice was gentle,her tone innocent beyond compare. "Why should you not ask him?" Ruthfrowned, perplexed and thoughtful, and now Diana turned to her withthe lively eye of one into whose mind has leapt a sudden inspiration."Ruth!" she exclaimed. "Why, indeed, should you not ask him to forgothis duel?""How, how could I?" faltered Ruth."He'd not deny you; you know he'd not.""I do not know it," answered Ruth. "But if I did, how could I ask it?""Were I Richard's sister, and had I his life and honour at heart as youhave, I'd not ask how. If Richard goes to that encounter he loses both,remember--unless between this and then he undergoes some change. Were Iin your place, I'd straight to Wilding.""To him?" mused Ruth, sitting up. "How could I go to him?""Go to him, yes," Diana insisted. "Go to him at once--while there is yettime."Ruth rose and moved away a step or two towards the water, deep inthought. Diana watched her furtively and slyly, the rapid rise and fallof her maiden breast betraying the agitation that filled her as shewaited--like a gamester--for the turn of the card that would show herwhether she had won or lost. For she saw clearly how Ruth might be socompromised that there was something more than a chance that Diana wouldno longer have cause to account her cousin a barrier between herself andBlake."I could not go alone," said Ruth, and her tone was that of one stillbattling with a notion that is repugnant."Why, if that is all," said Diana, "then I'll go with you.""I can't! I can't! Consider the humiliation.""Consider Richard rather," the fair temptress made answer eagerly. "Besure that Mr. Wilding will save you all humiliation. He'll not deny you.At a word from you, I know what answer he will make. He will refuse topush the matter forward--acknowledge himself in the wrong, do whateveryou may ask him. He can do it. None will question his courage. It hasbeen proved too often." She rose and came to Ruth. She set her armabout her waist again, and poured shrewd persuasion over her cousin'sindecision. "To-night you'll thank me for this thought," she assuredher. "Why do you pause? Are you so selfish as to think more of thelittle humiliation that may await you than of Richard's life andhonour?""No, no," Ruth protested feebly."What, then? Is Richard to go out and slay his honour by a show of fearbefore he is slain, himself, by the man he has insulted?""I'll go," said Ruth. Now that the resolve was taken, she was brisk,impatient. "Come, Diana. Let Jerry saddle for us. We'll ride to ZoylandChase at once."They went without a word to Richard who was still closeted withVallancey, and riding forth they crossed the river and took the roadthat, skirting Sedgemoor, runs south to Weston Zoyland. They rode withlittle said until they came to the point where the road branches on theleft, throwing out an arm across the moor towards Chedzoy, a mile or soshort of Zoyland Chase. Here Diana reined in with a sharp gasp of pain.Ruth checked, and cried to know what ailed her."It is the sun, I think," muttered Diana, her hand to her brow. "I amsick and giddy." And she slipped a thought heavily to the ground. In aninstant Ruth had dismounted and was beside her. Diana was pale, whichlent colour to her complaint, for Ruth was not to know that the pallorsprang from her agitation in wondering whether the ruse she attemptedwould succeed or not.A short stone's-throw from where they had halted stood a cottage backfrom the road in a little plot of ground, the property of a kindly oldwoman known to both. There Diana expressed the wish to rest awhile, andthither they took their way, Ruth leading both horses and supporting herfaltering cousin. The dame was all solicitude. Diana was led into herparlour, and what could be done was done. Her corsage was loosened,water drawn from the well and brought her to drink and bathe her brow.She sat back languidly, her head lolling sideways against one of thewings of the great chair, and languidly assured them she would be bettersoon if she were but allowed to rest awhile. Ruth drew up a stool tosit beside her, for all that her soul fretted at this delay. What if inconsequence she should reach Zoyland Chase too late--to find that Mr.Wilding had gone forth already? But even as she was about to sit, itseemed that the same thought had of a sudden come to Diana. The girlleaned forward, thrusting--as if by an effort--some of her faintnessfrom her."Do not wait for me, Ruth," she begged."I must, child.""You must not;" the other insisted. "Think what it may mean--Richard'slife, perhaps. No, no, Ruth, dear. Go on; go on to Zoyland. I'll followyou in a few minutes.""I'll wait for you," said Ruth with firmness.At that Diana rose, and in rising staggered. "Then we'll push on atonce," she gasped, as if speech itself were an excruciating effort."But you are in no case to stand!" said Ruth. "Sit, Diana, sit.""Either you go on alone or I go with you, but go at once you must. Atany moment Mr. Wilding may go forth, and your chance is lost. I'll nothave Richard's blood upon my head."Ruth wrung her hands in her dismay, confronted by a parlous choice.Consent to Diana's accompanying her in this condition she could not;ride on alone to Mr. Wilding's house was hardly to be thought of, andyet if she delayed she was endangering Richard's life. By the verystrength of her nature she was caught in the mesh of Diana's scheme.She saw that her hesitation was unworthy. This was no ordinary cause, noordinary occasion. It was a time for heroic measures. She must ride on,nor could she consent to take Diana.And so in the end she went, having seen her cousin settled again in thehigh chair, and took with her Diana's feeble assurances that she wouldfollow her in a few moments, as soon as her faintness passed.CHAPTER IV. TERMS OF SURRENDER"MR. WILDING rode at dawn with Mr. Trenchard, madam," announced oldWalters, the butler at Zoyland Chase. Old and familiar servant though hewas, he kept from his countenance all manifestation of the deep surpriseoccasioned him by the advent of Mistress Westmacott, unescorted."He rode... at dawn?" faltered Ruth, and for a moment she stoodirresolute, afraid and pondering in the shade of the great pillaredporch. Then she took heart again. If he rode at dawn, it was not inquest of Richard that he went, since it had been near eleven o'clockwhen she had left Bridgwater. He must have gone on other business first,and, doubtless, before he went to the encounter he would be returninghome. "Said he at what hour he would return?" she asked."He bade us expect him by noon, madam."This gave confirmation to her thoughts. It wanted more than half an hourto noon already. "Then he may return at any moment?" said she."At any moment, madam," was the grave reply.She took her resolve. "I will wait," she announced, to the man'sincreasing if undisplayed astonishment. "Let my horse be seen to."He bowed his obedience, and she followed him--a slender, gracefulfigure in her dove-coloured riding-habit laced with silver--across thestone-flagged vestibule, through the cool gloom of the great hall, intothe spacious library of which he held the door."Mistress Horton is following me," she informed the butler. "Will youbring her to me when she comes?"Bowing again in silent acquiescence, the white-haired servant closed thedoor and left her. She stood in the centre of the great room, drawingoff her riding-gloves, perturbed and frightened beyond all reason atfinding herself for the first time under Mr. Wilding's roof. He wasmost handsomely housed. His grandfather, who had travelled in Italy,had built the Chase upon the severe and noble lines which there he hadlearnt to admire, and he had embellished its interior, too, with manytreasures of art which with that intent he had there collected.She dropped her whip and gloves on to a table, and sank into a chairto wait, her heart fluttering in her throat. Time passed, and in thesilence of the great house her anxiety was gradually quieted, until atlast through the long window that stood open came faintly wafted to heron the soft breeze of that June morning the sound of a church clock atWeston Zoyland chiming twelve. She rose with a start, bethinking hersuddenly of Diana, and wondering why she had not yet arrived. Was thechild's indisposition graver than she had led Ruth to suppose? Shecrossed to the windows and stood there drumming impatiently upon thepane, her eyes straying idly over the sweep of elm-fringed lawns towardsthe river gleaming silvery here and there between the trees in thedistance.Suddenly she caught a sound of hoofs. Was this Diana? She sped to theother window, the one that stood open, and now she heard the crunch ofgravel and the champ of bits and the sound of more than two pairs ofhoofs. She caught a glimpse of Mr. Wilding and Mr. Trenchard.She felt the colour flying from her cheeks; again her heart fluttered inher throat, and it was in vain that with her hand she sought to repressthe heaving of her breast. She was afraid; her every instinct bade herslip through the window at which she stood and run from Zoyland Chase.And then she thought of Richard and his danger, and she seemed to gathercourage from the reflection of her purpose in this house.Men's voices reached her--a laugh, the harsh cawing of Nick Trenchard."A lady!" she heard him cry. "'Od's heart, Tony! Is this a time fortrafficking with doxies?" She crimsoned an instant at the coarse wordand set her teeth, only to pale again the next. The voices werelowered so that she heard not what was said; one sharp exclamation sherecognized to be in Wilding's voice, but caught not the word he uttered.There followed a pause, and she stirred uneasily, waiting. Thencame swift steps and jangling spurs across the hall, the door openedsuddenly, and Mr. Wilding, in a scarlet riding-coat, his boots whitewith dust, stood bowing to her from the threshold."Your servant, Mistress Westmacott," she heard him murmur. "My house isdeeply honoured."She dropped him a half-curtsy, pale and tongue-tied. He turned todeliver hat and whip and gloves to Walters, who had followed him, thenclosed the door and came forward into the room."You will forgive that I present myself thus before you," he said,in apology for his dusty raiment. "But I bethought me you might be inhaste, and Walters tells me that already have you waited nigh upon anhour. Will you not sit, madam?" And he advanced a chair. His long whiteface was set like a mask; but his dark, slanting eyes devoured her. Heguessed the reason of her visit. She who had humbled him, who had drivenhim to the very borders of despair, was now to be humbled and to despairbefore him. Under the impassive face his soul exulted fiercely.She disregarded the chair he proffered. "My visit... has no doubtsurprised you," she began, tremulous and hesitating."I' faith, no," he answered quietly. "The cause, after all, is not veryfar to seek. You are come on Richard's behalf.""Not on Richard's," she answered. "On my own." And now that the ice wasbroken, the suspense of waiting over, she found the tide of her courageflowing fast. "This encounter must not take place, Mr. Wilding," sheinformed him.He raised his eyebrows--fine and level as her own--his thin lips smilednever so faintly. "It is, I think," said he, "for Richard to prevent it.The chance was his last night. It shall be his again when we meet. If hewill express regret..." He left his sentence there. In truth he mockedher, though she guessed it not."You mean," said she, "that if he makes apology...?""What else? What other way remains?"She shook her head, and, if pale, her face was resolute, her glancesteady."That is impossible," she told him. "Last night--as I have the story--hemight have done it without shame. To-day it is too late. To tender hisapology on the ground would be to proclaim himself a coward."Mr. Wilding pursed his lips and shifted his position. "It is difficult,perhaps," said he, "but not impossible.""It is impossible," she insisted firmly."I'll not quarrel with you for a word," he answered, mighty agreeable."Call it impossible, if you will. Admit, however, that it is all Ican suggest. You will do me the justice, I am sure, to see that inexpressing my willingness to accept your brother's expressions of regretI am proving myself once more your very obedient servant. But that it isyou who ask it--and whose desires are my commands--I should let no mango unpunished for an insult such as your brother put upon me."She winced at his words, at the bow with which he had professed himselfonce more her servant."It is no clemency that you offer him," she said. "You leave him achoice between death and dishonour.""He has," Wilding reminded her, "the chance of combat."She flung back her head impatiently. "I think you mock me," said she.He looked at her keenly. "Will you tell me plainly, madam," he begged,"what you would have me do?"She flushed under his gaze, and the flush told him what he sought tolearn. There was, of course, another way, and she had thought of it;but she lacked--as well she might, all things considered--the courageto propose it. She had come to Mr. Wilding in the vague hope that hehimself would choose the heroic part. And he, to punish for her scornof him this woman whom he loved to hating-point, was resolved that sheherself must beg it of him. Whether, having so far compelled her, hewould grant her prayer or not was something he could not just thenhimself have told you. She bowed her head in silence, and Wilding, thatfaint smile, half friendliness, half mockery, hovering ever on hislips, turned aside and moved softly towards the window. Her eyes, veiledbehind the long lashes of their drooping lids, followed him furtively.She felt that she hated him in very truth. She marked the uprightelegance of his figure, the easy grace of his movements, the finearistocratic mould of the aquiline face, which she beheld in profile;and she hated him the more for these outward favours that must commendhim to no lack of women. He was too masterful. He made her realize tookeenly her own weakness and that of Richard. She felt that just now hecontrolled the vice that held her fast--her affection for her brother.And because of that she hated him the more. "You see, MistressWestmacott," said he, his shoulder to her, his tone sweet to the pointof sadness, "that there is nothing else." She stood, her eyes followingthe pattern of the parquetry, her foot unconsciously tracing it; hercourage ebbed, and she had no answer for him. After a pause he spokeagain, still without turning. "If that was not enough to suit yourends"--and though he spoke in a tone of ever-increasing sadness, thereglinted through it the faintest ray of mockery--"I marvel you shouldhave come to Zoyland--to compromise yourself to so little purpose."She raised a startled face. "Com... compromise myself?" she echoed."Oh!" It was a cry of indignation."What else?" quoth he, and turned abruptly to confront her."Mistress Horton was... was with me," she panted, her voice quivering ason the brink of tears."'Tis unfortunate you should have separated," he condoled."But... but, Mr. Wilding, I... I trusted to your honour. I accounted youa gentleman. Surely... surely, sir, you will not let it be known that...I came to you? You will keep my secret?""Secret!" said he, his eyebrows raised. "'Tis already the talk of theservants' hall. By to-morrow 'twill be the gossip of Bridgwater."Air failed her. Her blue eyes fixed him in horror out of her strickenface. Not a word had she wherewith to answer him.The sight of her, thus, affected him oddly. His passion for her surgedup, aroused by pity for her plight, and awakened in him a sense of hisbrutality. A faint flush stirred in his cheeks. He stepped quickly toher, and caught her hand. She let it lie, cold and inert, within hisnervous grasp."Ruth, Ruth!" he cried, and his voice was for once unsteady. "Give it nothought! I love you, Ruth. If you'll but heed that, no breath of scandalcan hurt you."She swallowed hard. "As how?" she asked mechanically.He bowed low over her hand--so low that his face was hidden from her."If you will do me the honour to become my wife..." he began, but got nofurther, for she snatched away her hand, her cheeks crimsoning, her eyesaflame with indignation. He stepped back, crimsoning too. She had dashedthe gentleness from his mood. He was angered now and tigerish."Oh!" she panted. "It is to affront me! Is this the time or place..."He cropped her flow of indignant speech ere it was well begun. He caughther in his arms, and held her tight, and so sudden was the act, so firmhis grip that she had not the thought or force to struggle."All time is love's time, all places are love's place," he told her,his face close to her own. "And of all time and places the present everpreferable to the wise--for life is uncertain and short at best. I bringyou worship, and you answer me with scorn. But I shall prevail, and youshall come to love me in very spite of your own self."She threw back her head, away from his as far as the bonds he had castabout her would allow. "Air! Air!" she panted feebly."Oh, you shall have air enough anon," he answered with a half-strangledlaugh, his passion mounting ever. "Hark you, now--hark you, forRichard's sake, since you'll not listen for my own nor yours. There isanother course by which I can save both Richard's life and honour.You know it, and you counted upon my generosity to suggest it. But youoverlooked the thing on which you should have counted. You overlooked mylove. Count upon that, my Ruth, and Richard shall have naught to fear.Count upon that, and when we meet this evening, Richard and I, it isI who will tender the apology, I who will admit that I was wrong tointroduce your name into that company last night, and that what Richarddid was a just and well-deserved punishment upon me. This will I do ifyou'll but count upon my love."She looked up at him fearfully, yet with flutterings of hope. "What is'tyou mean?" she asked him faintly."That if you'll promise to be my wife...""Your wife!" she interrupted him. She struggled to free herself,released one arm and struck him in the face. "Let me go, you coward!"He was answered. His arms melted from her. He fell back a pace, verywhite and even trembling, the fire all gone from his eye, which was nowturned dull and deadly."So be it," he said, and strode to the bell-rope. "I'll not offendagain. I had not offended now"--he continued, in the voice of oneoffering an explanation cold and formal--"but that when first I cameinto your life you seemed to bid me welcome." His fingers closed uponthe crimson bell-cord. She guessed his purpose."Wait!" she gasped, and put forth her hand. He paused, the rope in his,his eye kindling anew. "You... you mean to kill Richard now?" she askedhim.A swift lifting of his brows was his only answer. He tugged the cord.From the distance the peal of the bell reached them faintly."Oh, wait, wait!" she begged, her hands pressed against her cheeks. Hestood impassible--hatefully impassible. "....... if I were to consentto... this... how... how soon...?" He understood the unfinishedquestion. Interest warmed his face again. He took a step towards her,but by a gesture she seemed to beg him come no nearer."If you will promise to marry me within the week, Richard shall have nocause to fear either for his life or his honour at my hands."She seemed now to be recovering her calm. "Very well," she said, hervoice singularly steady. "Let that be a bargain between us. SpareRichard's life and honour--both, remember!--and on Sunday next..." Forall her courage her voice quavered and faltered. She dared add no more,lest it should break altogether.Mr. Wilding drew a deep breath. Again he would have advanced. "Ruth!"he cried, and some repentance smote him, some shame shook him inhis purpose. At that moment it was in his mind to capitulateunconditionally; to tell her that Richard should have naught to fearfrom him, and yet that she should go free as the winds. Her gesturechecked him. It was so eloquent of aversion. He paused in his advance,stifled his better feelings, and turned once more, relentless. The dooropened and old Walters stood awaiting his commands."Mistress Westmacott is leaving," he informed his servant, and bowedlow and formally in farewell before her. She passed out without anotherword, the old butler following, and presently through the door thatremained open came Trenchard, in quest of Mr. Wilding who stood bemused.Nick sauntered in, his left eye almost hidden by the rakish cock of hishat, one hand tucked away under the skirts of his plum-coloured coat,the other supporting the stem of a long clay pipe, at which he waspulling thoughtfully. The pipe and he were all but inseparable; indeed,the year before in London he had given appalling scandal by appearingwith it in the Mall, and had there remained him any character to lose,he must assuredly have lost it then.He observed his friend through narrowing eyes--he had small eyes, veryblue and very bright, in which there usually abode a roguish gleam."My sight, Anthony," said he, "reminds me that I am growing old. Iwonder did it mislead me on the score of your visitor?""The lady who left," said Wilding with a touch of severity, "will beMistress Wilding by this day se'night."Trenchard took the pipe from his lips, audibly blew out a cloud of smokeand stared at his friend. "Body o' me!" quoth he. "Is this a time formarrying?--with these rumours of Monmouth's coming over."Wilding made an impatient gesture. "I thought to have convinced you theyare idle," said he, and flung himself into a chair at his writing-table.Nick came over and perched himself upon the table's edge, one legswinging in the air. "And what of this matter of the intercepted letterfrom London to our Taunton friends?""I can't tell you. But of this I am sure, His Grace is incapable ofanything so rash. Certain is it that he'll not stir until Battiscombreturns to Holland, and Battiscomb is still in Cheshire sounding theDuke's friends.""Yet were I you, I should not marry just at present."Wilding smiled. "If you were me, you'd never marry at all.""Faith, no!" said Trenchard. "I'd as soon play at 'hot-cockles,' or'Parson-has-lost-his-cloak.' 'Tis a mort more amusing and the soonerdone with."CHAPTER V. THE ENCOUNTERRuth Wesmacott rode back like one in a dream, with vague and hazynotions of what she saw or did. So overwrought was she by the interviewfrom which she came, her mind so obsessed by it, that never a thoughthad she for Diana and her indisposition until she arrived home tofind her cousin there before her. Diana was in tears, called up by thereproaches of her mother, Lady Horton--the relict of that fine soldierSir Cholmondeley Horton, of Taunton.The girl had arrived at Lupton House a half-hour ahead of MissWestmacott, and upon her arrival she had expressed surprise, eitherfeigned or real, at finding Ruth still absent. Detecting the alarmthat Diana was careful to throw into her voice and manner, her motherquestioned her, and elicited the story of her faintness and of Ruth'shaving ridden on alone to Mr. Wilding's. So outraged was Lady Hortonthat for once in a way this woman, usually so meek and ease-loving,was roused to an energy and anger with her daughter and her niece thatthreatened to remove Diana at once from the pernicious atmosphere ofLupton House and carry her home to Taunton. Ruth found her still at herremonstrances, arrived, indeed, in time for her share of them."I have been sore mistaken in you, Ruth!" the dame reproached her. "Ican scarce believe it of you. I have held you up as an example to Diana,for the discretion and wisdom of your conduct, and you do this! You goalone to Mr. Wilding's house--to Mr. Wilding's, of all men!""It was no time for ordinary measures," said Ruth, but she spoke withoutany of the heat of one who defends her conduct. She was, the slylywatchful Diana observed, very white and tired. "It was no time to thinkof nice conduct. There was Richard to be saved.""And was it worth ruining yourself to do that?" quoth Lady Horton, hercolour high."Ruining myself?" echoed Ruth, and she smiled never so weary a smile. "Ihave, indeed, done that, though not in the way you mean."Mother and daughter eyed her, mystified. "Your good name is blasted,"said her aunt, "unless so be that Mr. Wilding is proposing to make youhis wife." It was a sneer the good woman could not, in her indignation,repress."That is what Mr. Wilding has done me the honour to propose," Ruthanswered bitterly, and left them gaping. "We are to be married this dayse'night."A dead silence followed the calm announcement. Then Diana rose. At themisery, the anguish that could impress so strange and white a lookon Ruth's winsome face, she was smitten with remorse, her incipientsatisfaction dashed. This was her work; the fruit of her scheming. Butit had gone further than she had foreseen; and for all that no resultcould better harmonize with her own ambitions and desires, for themoment--under the first shock of that announcement--she felt guilty andgrew afraid."Ruth!" she cried, her voice a whisper of stupefaction. "Oh, I wish Ihad come with you!""But you couldn't; you were faint." And then--recalling what hadpassed--her mind was filled with sudden concern for Diana, even amid herown sore troubles. "Are you quite yourself again, Diana?" she inquired.Diana answered almost fiercely, "I am quite well." And then, with achange to wistfulness, she added, "Oh, I would I had come with you!""Matters had been no different," Ruth assured her. "It was a bargainMr. Wilding drove. It was the price I had to pay for Richard's life andhonour." She swallowed hard, and let her hands fall limply to her sides."Where is Richard?" she inquired.It was her aunt who answered her. "He went forth half an hour agone withMr. Vallancey and Sir Rowland.""Sir Rowland had returned, then?" She looked up quickly."Yes," answered Diana. "But he had achieved nothing by his visit to LordGervase. His lordship would not intervene; he swore he hoped the cubwould be flayed alive by Wilding. Those were his lordship's words, asSir Rowland repeated them. Sir Rowland is in sore distress for Richard.He has gone with them to the meeting.""At least, he has no longer cause for his distress," said MissWestmacott with her bitter smile, and sank as one exhausted to a chair.Lady Horton moved to comfort her, her motherliness all aroused for thismotherless girl, usually so wise and strong, and seemingly wiser andstronger than ever in this thing that Lady Horton had deemed a weaknessand a folly.Meanwhile, Richard and his two friends were on their way to the moorsacross the river to the encounter with Mr. Wilding. But before theyhad got him to ride forth, Vallancey had had occasion to regret that hestood committed to a share in this quarrel, for he came to know Richardas he really was. He had found him in an abject state, white andtrembling, his coward's fancy anticipating a hundred times a minute thedeath he was anon to die.Vallancey had hailed him cheerily."The day is yours, Dick," he had cried, when Richard entered the librarywhere he awaited him. "Wild Wilding has ridden to Taunton this morningand is to be back by noon. Odsbud, Dick!--twenty miles and more in thesaddle before coming on the ground. Heard you ever of the like madness?He'll be stiff as a broom-handle--an easy victim."Richard listened, stared, and, finding Vallancey's eyes fixed steadilyupon him, attempted a smile and achieved a horrible grimace."What ails you, man?" cried his second, and caught him by the wrist. Hefelt the quiver of the other's limb. "Stab me!" quoth he, "you are in nocase to fight. What the plague ails you?""I am none so well this morning," answered Richard feebly. "LordGervase's claret," he added, passing a hand across his brow."Lord Gervase's claret?" echoed Vallancey in horror, as at someoutrageous blasphemy. "Frontignac at ten shillings the bottle!" heexclaimed."Still, claret never does lie easy on my stomach," Richard explained,intent upon blaming Lord Gervase s wine--since he could think of nothingelse--for his condition.Vallancey looked at him shrewdly. "My cock," said he, "if you're tofight we'll have to mend your temper." He took it upon himself to ringthe bell, and to order up two bottles of Canary and one of brandy. If hewas to get his man to the ground at all--and young Vallancey had a duesense of his responsibilities in that connection--it would be well tosupply Richard with something to replace the courage that had oozedout overnight. Young Richard, never loath to fortify himself, provedamenable enough to the stiffly laced Canary that his friend set beforehim. Then, to divert his mind, Vallancey, with that rash freedom thathad made the whole of Somerset know him for a rebel, set himself to talkof the Protestant Duke and his right to the crown of England.He was still at his talk, Richard listening moodily what time he wasslowly but surely befuddling himself, when Sir Rowland--returning fromScoresby Hall--came to bring the news of his lack of success. Richardhailed him noisily, and bade him ring for another glass, adding, witha burst of oaths, some appalling threats of how anon he should serveAnthony Wilding. His wits drowned in the stiff liquor Vallancey hadpressed upon him, he seemed of a sudden to have grown as fierce andbloodthirsty as any scourer that ever terrorized the watch.Blake listened to him and grunted. "Body o' me!" swore the town gallant."If that's the humour you're going out to fight in, I'll trouble you forthe eight guineas I won from you at Primero yesterday before you start."Richard reared himself, by the help of the table, and stood a thoughtunsteadily, his glance laboriously striving to engage Blake's."Damn me!" quoth he. "Your want of faith dishgraces me--and 't 'shgracesyou. Shalt ha' the guineas when we're back--and not before.""Hum!" quoth Blake, to whom eight guineas were a consideration in thesebankrupt days. "And if you don't come back at all upon whom am I todraw?"The suggestion sank through Dick's half-fuddled senses, and the scare itgave him was reflected on his face."Damn you, Blake!" swore Vallancey between his teeth. "Is that a decentway to talk to a man who is going out? Never heed him, Dick! Let himwait for his dirty guineas till we return.""Thirty guineas?" hiccoughed Richard. "It was only eight.Anyhow--wait'll I've sli' the gullet of's Mr. Wilding." He checked ona thought that suddenly occurred to him. He turned to Vallancey with aludicrous solemnity. "'Sbud!" he swore. "'S a scurvy trick I'm playingthe Duke. 'S treason to him--treason no less." And he smote the tablewith his open hand."What's that?" quoth Blake so sharply, his eyes so suddenly alert thatVallancey made haste to cover up his fellow rebel's indiscretion."It's the brandy-and-Canary makes him dream," said he with a laugh, andrising as he spoke he announced that it was high time they should setout. Thus he brought about a bustle that drove the Duke's business fromRichard's mind, and left Blake without a pretext to pursue his questfor information. But the mischief was done, and Blake's suspicions wereawake. He bethought him now of dark hints that Richard had let fallto Vallancey in the past few days, and of hints less dark with whichVallancey--who was a careless fellow at ordinary times--had answered.And now this mention of the Duke and of treason to him--to what Dukecould it refer but Monmouth?Blake was well aware of the wild tales that were going round, and hebegan to wonder now was aught really afoot, and was his good friendWestmacott in it?If there was, he bethought him that the knowledge might be of value,and it might help to float once more his shipwrecked fortunes. The hastewith which Vallancey had proffered a frivolous explanation of Richard'swords, the bustle with which upon the instant he swept Richard and SirRowland from the house to get to horse and ride out to Bridgwater werein themselves circumstances that went to heighten those suspicions ofSir Rowland's. But lacking all opportunity for investigation at themoment, he deemed it wisest to say no more just then lest he shouldbetray his watchfulness.They were the first to arrive upon the ground--an open space on theborders of Sedgemoor, in the shelter of Polden Hill. But they had notlong to wait before Wilding and Trenchard rode up, attended by a groom.Their arrival had an oddly sobering effect upon young Westmacott, forwhich Mr. Vallancey was thankful. For during their ride he had begun tofear that he had carried too far the business of equipping his principalwith artificial valour.Trenchard came forward to offer Vallancey the courteous suggestion thatMr. Wilding's servant should charge himself with the care of the horsesof Mr. Westmacott's party, if this would be a convenience tothem. Vallancey thanked him and accepted the offer, and thus thegroom--instructed by Trenchard--led the five horses some distance fromthe spot.It now became a matter of making preparation, and leaving Richard todivest himself of such garments as he might deem cumbrous, Vallanceywent forward to consult with Trenchard upon the choice of ground. Atthat same moment Mr. Wilding lounged forward, flicking the grass withhis whip in an absent manner."Mr. Vallancey," he began, when Trenchard turned to interrupt him."You can leave it safely to me, Tony," he growled. "But there issomething I wish to say, Nick," answered Mr. Wilding, his manner mild."By your leave, then." And he turned again to Valiancey. "Will you be sogood as to call Mr. Westmacott hither?"Vallancey stared. "For what purpose, sir?" he asked."For my purpose," answered Mr. Wilding sweetly. "It is no longer my wishto engage with Mr. Westmacott."Anthony!" cried Trenchard, and in his amazement forgot to swear."I propose," added Mr. Wilding, "to relieve Mr. Westmacott of thenecessity of fighting."Vallancey in his heart thought this might be pleasant news for hisprincipal. Still, he did not quite see how the end was to be attained,and said so."You shall be enlightened if you will do as I request," Wildinginsisted, and Vallancey, with a lift of the brows, a snort, and a shrug,turned away to comply."Do you mean," quoth Trenchard, bursting with indignation, "that youwill let live a man who has struck you?"Wilding took his friend affectionately by the arm. "It is a whim ofmine," said he. "Do you think, Nick, that it is more than I can affordto indulge?""I say not so," was the ready answer; "but...""I thought you'd not," said Mr. Wilding, interrupting. "And if anydoes--why, I shall be glad to prove it upon him that he lies." Helaughed, and Trenchard, vexed though he was, was forced to laugh withhim. Then Nick set himself to urge the thing that last night had plaguedhis mind: that this Richard might prove a danger to the Cause; thatin the Duke's interest, if not to safeguard his own person from somevindictive betrayal, Wilding would be better advised in imposing areliable silence upon him."But why vindictive?" Mr. Wilding remonstrated. "Rather must he havecause for gratitude."Mr. Trenchard laughed short and contemptuously. "There is," said he, "norancour more bitter than that of the mean man who has offended you andwhom you have spared. I beg you'll ponder it." He lowered his voice ashe ended his admonition, for Vallancey and Westmacott were coming up,followed by Sir Rowland Blake.Richard, although his courage had been sinking lower and lower in ameasure as he had grown more and more sober with the approach of themoment for engaging, came forward now with a firm step and an arrogantmien; for Vallancey had given him more than a hint of what was toward.His heart had leapt, not only at the deliverance that was promised him,but out of satisfaction at the reflection of how accurately last nighthe had gauged what Mr. Wilding would endure. It had dismayed him then,as we have seen, that this man who, he thought, must stomach any affrontfrom him out of consideration for his sister, should have ended bycalling him to account. He concluded now that upon reflection Wildinghad seen his error, and was prepared to make amends that he mightextricate himself from an impossible situation, and Richard blamedhimself for having overlooked this inevitable solution and given way toidle panic.Vallancey and Blake watching him, and the sudden metamorphosis that waswrought in him, despised him heartily, and yet were glad--for the sakeof their association with him--that things were as they were."Mr. Westmacott," said Wilding quietly, his eyes steadily set uponRichard's own arrogant gaze, his lips smiling a little, "I am here notto fight, but to apologize."Richard's sneer was audible to all. Oh, he was gathering courage fastnow that there no longer was the need for it. It urged him to lengths ofdaring possible only to a fool."If you can take a blow, Mr. Wilding," said he offensively, "that isyour own affair."And his friends gasped at his temerity and trembled for him, not knowingwhat grounds he had for counting himself unassailable."Just so," said Mr. Wilding, as meek and humble as a nun, and Trenchard,who had expected something very different from him, swore aloud and withsome circumstance of oaths. "The fact is," continued Mr. Wilding, "thatwhat I did last night, I did in the heat of wine, and I am sorry forit. I recognize that this quarrel is of my provoking; that it wasunwarrantable in me to introduce the name of Mistress Westmacott, nomatter how respectfully; and that in doing so I gave Mr. Westmacottample grounds for offence. For that I beg his pardon, and I venture tohope that this matter need go no further."Vallancey and Blake were speechless in astonishment; Trenchardlivid with fury. Westmacott moved a step or two forward, a swaggerunmistakable in his gait, his nether-lip thrust out in a sneer."Why," said he, his voice mighty disdainful, "if Mr. Wilding apologizes,the matter hardly can go further." He conveyed such a suggestion ofregret at this that Trenchard bounded forward, stung to speech."But if Mr. Westmacott's disappointment threatens to overwhelm him," hesnapped, very tartly, "I am his humble servant, and he may call upon meto see that he's not robbed of the exercise he came to take."Mr. Wilding set a restraining hand upon Trenchard's arm.Westmacott turned to him, the sneer, however, gone from his face."I have no quarrel with you, sir," said he, with an uneasy assumption ofdignity."It's a want that may be soon supplied," answered Trenchard briskly,and, as he afterwards confessed, had not Wilding checked him at thatmoment, he had thrown his hat in Richard's face.It was Vallancey who saved the situation, cursing in his heart thebearing of his principal."Mr. Wilding," said he, "this is very handsome in you. You are of thehappy few who may tender such an apology without reflection upon yourcourage."Mr. Wilding made him a leg very elegantly. "You are vastly kind, sir,"said he."You have given Mr. Westmacott the fullest satisfaction, and it is withan increased respect for you--if that were possible--that I acknowledgeit on my friend's behalf.""You are, sir, a very mirror of the elegancies," said Mr. Wilding, andVallancey wondered was he being laughed at. Whether he was or not, heconceived that he had done the only seemly thing. He had made handsomeacknowledgment of a handsome apology, stung to it by the currishness ofRichard.And there the matter ended, despite Trenchard's burning eagerness tocarry it himself to a different consummation. Wilding prevailed uponhim, and withdrew him from the field. But as they rode back to ZoylandChase the old rake was bitter in his inveighings against Wilding's follyand weakness."I pray Heaven," he kept repeating, "that it may not come to cost youdear.""Have done," said Mr. Wilding, a trifle out of patience. "Could I wedthe sister having slain the brother?"And Trenchard, understanding at last, accounted himself a numskull thathe had not understood before. But he none the less deemed it a pityRichard had been spared.CHAPTER VI. THE CHAMPIONAs vainglorious was Richard Westmacott's retreat from the field ofunstricken battle as his advance upon it had been inglorious. He spokewith confidence now of the narrow escape that Wilding had had athis hands, of the things he would have done to Wilding had not thatgentleman grown wise in time. Sir Rowland, who had seen little ofRichard's earlier stricken condition, was in a measure imposed upon byhis blustering tone and manner; not so Vallancey, who remembered thesteps he had been forced to take to bolster up the young man's couragesufficiently to admit of his being brought to the encounter. Richard sodisgusted him that he felt if he did not quit his company soon, he wouldbe quarrelling with him himself. So, congratulating him, in a causticmanner that Richard did not relish, upon the happy termination of theaffair, Vallancey took his leave of him and Blake at the cross-roads,pleading business with Lord Gervase, and left them to proceed withouthim to Bridgwater.Blake, whose suspicions of some secret matter to which Vallanceyand Richard were wedded, had been earlier excited by Westmacott'sindiscretions, was full of sly questions now touching the business whichmight be taking Vallancey to Scoresby. But Richard was too full ofthe subject of the fear he had instilled into Wilding to afford hiscompanion much satisfaction on any other score. Thus they came to LuptonHouse, and as Richard swaggered down the lawn into the presence of theladies--Ruth and her aunt were occupying the stone bench, Diana thecircular seat about the great oak in the centre of the lawn--he was avery different person from the pale, limp creature they had beheld theresome few hours earlier. Loud and offensive was he now in self-laudation,and so indifferent to all else that he left unobserved the little smile,half wistful, half scornful, that visited his sister's lips when hesneeringly told how Mr. Wilding had chosen that better part of valourwhich discretion is alleged to be.It needed Diana, who, blinded by no sisterly affection, saw him exactlyas he was, and despised him accordingly, to enlighten him. It may alsobe that in doing so at once she had ends of her own to serve; for SirRowland was still of the company."Mr. Wilding afraid?" she cried, her voice so charged with derision thatit inclined to shrillness. "La! Richard, Mr. Wilding was never afraid ofany man.""Faith!" said Rowland, although his acquaintance with Mr. Wilding wasslight and recent. "It is what I should think. He does not look like aman familiar with fear."Richard struck something of an attitude, his fair face flushed, his paleeyes glittering. "He took a blow," said he, and sneered."There may have been reasons," Diana suggested darkly, and Sir Rowland'seyes narrowed at the hint.Again he recalled the words Richard had let fall that afternoon. Wildingand he were fellow workers in some secret business, and Richard had saidthat the encounter was treason to that same business, whatever it mightbe. And of what it might be Sir Rowland had grounds upon which to foundat least a guess. Had perhaps Wilding acted upon some similar feelingsin avoiding the duel? He wondered; and when Richard dismissed Diana'schallenge with a fatuous laugh, it was Blake who took it up."You speak, ma'am," said he, "as if you knew that there were reasons,and knew, too, what those reasons might be."Diana looked at Ruth, as if for guidance before replying. But Ruth satcalm and seemingly impassive, looking straight before her. She was,indeed, indifferent how much Diana said, for in any case the mattercould not remain a secret long. Lady Horton, silent too and listening,looked a question at her daughter.And so, after a pause: "I know both," said Diana, her eyes strayingagain to Ruth; and a subtler man than Blake would have read that glanceand understood that this same reason which he sought so diligently satthere before him.Richard, indeed, catching that sly look of his cousin's, checked hisassurance, and stood frowning, cogitating. Then, quite suddenly, hisvoice harsh:"What do you mean, Diana?" he inquired.Diana shrugged and turned her shoulder to him. "You had best ask Ruth,"said she, which was an answer more or less plain to both the men.They stood at gaze, Richard looking a thought foolish. Blake, frowning,his heavy lip caught in his strong, white teeth.Ruth turned to her brother with an almost piteous attempt at a smile.She sought to spare him pain by excluding from her manner all suggestionthat things were other than she desired."I am betrothed to Mr. Wilding," said she.Sir Rowland made a sudden forward movement, drew a deep breath, and assuddenly stood still. Richard looked at his sister as she were mad andraving. Then he laughed, between unbelief and derision."It is a jest," said he, but his accents lacked conviction."It is the truth," Ruth assured him quietly."The truth?" His brow darkened ominously--stupendously for one so fair."The truth, you baggage...?" He began and stopped in very fury.She saw that she must tell him all."I promised to wed Mr. Wilding this day se'night so that he saved yourlife and honour," she told him calmly, and added, "It was a bargain thatwe drove." Richard continued to stare at her. The thing she told himwas too big to be swallowed at a mouthful; he was absorbing it by slowdegrees."So now," said Diana, "you know the sacrifice your sister has made tosave you, and when you speak of the apology Mr. Wilding tendered you,perhaps you'll speak of it in a tone less loud."But the sarcasm was no longer needed. Already poor Richard was veryhumble, his make-believe spirit all snuffed out. He observed at lasthow pale and set was his sister's face, and he realized something ofthe sacrifice she had made. Never in all his life was Richard so nearto lapsing from the love of himself; never so near to forgetting hisown interests, and preferring those of Ruth. Lady Horton sat silent, herheart fluttering with dismay and perplexity. Heaven had not equipped herwith a spirit capable of dealing with a situation such as this. Blakestood in make believe stolidity dissembling his infinite chagrin andthe stormy emotions warring within him, for some signs of which Dianawatched his countenance in vain."You shall not do it!" cried Richard suddenly. He came forward and laidhis hand on his sister's shoulder. His voice was almost gentle. "Ruth,you shall not do this for me. You must not.""By Heaven, no!" snapped Blake before she could reply. "You are right,Richard. Mistress Westmacott must not be the scapegoat. She shall notplay the part of Iphigenia."But Ruth smiled wistfully as she answered him with a question, "Where isthe help for it?"Richard knew where the help for it lay, and for once--for just amoment--he contemplated danger and even death with equanimity."I can take up this quarrel again," he announced. "I can compel Mr.Wilding to meet me."Ruth's eyes, looking up at him, kindled with pride and admiration. Itwarmed her heart to hear him speak thus, to have this assurance that hewas anything but the coward she had been so disloyal as to deem him; nodoubt she had been right in saying that it was his health was the causeof the palsy he had displayed that morning; he was a little wild, sheknew; inclined to sit over-late at the bottle; with advancing manhood,she had no doubt, he would overcome this boyish failing. Meanwhileit was this foolish habit--nothing more--that undermined the inherentfirmness of his nature. And it comforted her generous soul to have thisproof that he was full worthy of the sacrifice she was making for him.Diana watched him in some surprise, and never doubted but that his offerwas impulsive, and that he would regret it when his ardour had had timeto cool."It were idle," said Ruth at last--not that she quite believed it, butthat it was all-important to her that Richard should not be imperilled."Mr. Wilding will prefer the bargain he has made.""No doubt," growled Blake, "but he shall be forced to unmake it." Headvanced and bowed low before her. "Madam," said he, "will you grantme leave to champion your cause and remove this troublesome Mr. Wildingfrom your path?"Diana's eyes narrowed; her cheeks paled, partly from fear for Blake,partly from vexation at the promptness of an offer that afforded a freshand so eloquent proof of the trend of his affections.Ruth smiled at him in a very friendly manner, but gently shook her head."I thank you, sir," said she. "But it were more than I could permit.This has become a family affair."There was in her tone something which, despite its friendliness,gave Sir Rowland his dismissal. He was not at best a man of keensensibilities; yet even so, he could not mistake the request towithdraw that was implicit in her tone and manner. He took his leave,registering, however, in his heart a vow that he would have his way withWilding. Thus must he--through her gratitude--assuredly come to have hisway with Ruth.Diana rose and turned to her mother. "Come," she said, "we'll speed SirRowland. Ruth and Richard would perhaps prefer to remain alone."Ruth thanked her with her eyes. Richard, standing beside his sister withbent head and moody gaze, did not appear to have heard. Thus he remaineduntil he and his half-sister were alone together, then he flung himselfwearily into the seat beside her, and took her hand."Ruth," he faltered, "Ruth!"She stroked his hand, her honest, intelligent eyes bent upon him ina look of pity--and to indulge this pity for him, she forgot how muchherself she needed pity."Take it not so to heart," she urged him, her voice low and crooning--as that of a mother to her babe. "Take it not so to heart, Richard.I should have married some day, and, after all, it may well be that Mr.Wilding will make me as good a husband as another. I do believe," sheadded, her only intent to comfort Richard; "that he loves me; and if heloves me, surely he will prove kind."He flung himself back with an exclamation of angry pain. He was white tothe lips, his eyes bloodshot. "It must not be--it shall not be--I'll notendure it!" he cried hoarsely."Richard, dear..." she began, recapturing the hand he had snatched fromhers in his gust of emotion.He rose abruptly, interrupting her. "I'll go to Wilding now," he cried,his voice resolute. "He shall cancel this bargain he had no right tomake. He shall take up his quarrel with me where it stood before youwent to him.""No, no, Richard, you must not!" she urged him, frightened, rising too,and clinging to his arm."I will," he answered. "At the worst he can but kill me. But at leastyou shall not be sacrificed.""Sit here, Richard," she bade him. "There is something you have notconsidered. If you die, if Mr. Wilding kills you..." she paused.He looked at her, and at the repetition of the fate that would probablyawait him if he persevered in the course he threatened, his purelyemotional courage again began to fail him. A look of fear creptgradually into his face to take the room of the resolution that had beenstamped upon it but a moment since.He swallowed hard. "What then?" he asked, his voice harsh, and, obeyingher command and the pressure on his hand, he resumed his seat besideher.She spoke now at length and very gravely, dwelling upon the circumstancethat he was the head of the family, the last Westmacott of his line,pointing out to him the importance of his existence, the insignificanceof her own. She was but a girl, a thing of small account where theperpetuation of a family was at issue. After all, she must marrysomebody some day, she repeated, and perhaps she had been foolish inattaching too much importance to the tales she had heard of Mr.Wilding. Probably he was no worse than other men, and after all he wasa gentleman of wealth and position, such a man as half the women inSomerset might be proud to own for husband.Her arguments and his weakness--his returning cowardice, which made himlend an ear to those same arguments--prevailed with him; at least theyconvinced him that he was far too important a person to risk his life inthis quarrel upon which he had so rashly entered. He did not say thathe was convinced; but he said that he would give the matter thought,hinting that perhaps some other way might present itself of cancellingthe bargain she had made. They had a week before them, and in any casehe promised readily in answer to her entreaties--for her faith inhim was a thing unquenchable--that he would do nothing without takingcounsel with her.Meanwhile Diana had escorted Sir Rowland to the main gates of LuptonHouse, in front of which Miss Westmacott's groom was walking his horse,awaiting him."Sir Rowland," said she at parting, "your chivalry makes you take thismatter too deeply to heart. You overlook the possibility that my cousinmay have good reason for not desiring your interference."He looked keenly at this little lady to whom a month ago he had beenon the point of offering marriage. His coxcombry might readily havesuggested to him that she was in love with him, but that his conscienceand inclinations urged him to assure himself that this was not the case."What shall that mean, madam?" he asked her.Diana hesitated. "What I have said is plain," she answered, and it wasclear that she held something back.Sir Rowland flattered himself upon the shrewdness with which he readher, never dreaming that he had but read just what she intended heshould.He stood squarely before her, shaking his great head. "Not plain enoughfor me," he said. Then his tone softened to one of prayer. "Tell me," hebesought her."I can't! I can't!" she cried in feigned distress. "It were toodisloyal."He frowned. He caught her arm and pressed it, his heart sick withjealous alarm. "What do you mean? Tell me, tell me, Mistress Horton."Diana lowered her eyes. "You'll not betray me?" she stipulated."Why, no. Tell me."She flushed delicately. "I am disloyal to Ruth," she said, "and yet I amloath to see you cozened.""Cozened?" quoth he hoarsely, his egregious vanity in arms. "Cozened?"Diana explained. "Ruth was at his house to-day," said she, "closetedalone with him for an hour or more.""Impossible!" he cried."Where else was the bargain made?" she asked, and shattered his lastdoubt. "You know that Mr. Wilding has not been here."Yet Blake struggled heroically against conviction."She went to intercede for Richard," he protested. Miss Horton lookedup at him, and under her glance Sir Rowland felt that he was a man ofunfathomable ignorance. Then she turned aside her eyes and shrugged hershoulders very eloquently. "You are a man of the world, Sir Rowland. Youcannot seriously suppose that any maid would so imperil her good name inany cause?"Darker grew his florid countenance; his bulging eyes looked troubled andperplexed."You mean that she loves him?" he said, between question and assertion.Diana pursed her lips. "You shall draw your own inference," quoth she.He breathed heavily, and squared his broad shoulders, as one who braceshimself for battle against an element stronger than himself."But her talk of sacrifice?" he cried.Diana laughed, and again he was stung by her contempt of hisperceptions. "Her brother is set against her marrying him," said she."Here was her chance. Is it not very plain?"Doubt stared from his eyes. "Why do you tell me this?""Because I esteem you, Sir Rowland," she answered very gently. "I wouldnot have you meddle in a matter you cannot mend.""Which I am not desired to mend, say rather," he replied with heavysarcasm. "She would not have my interference!" He laughed angrily. "Ithink you are right, Mistress Diana," he said, "and I think that morethan ever is there the need to kill this Mr. Wilding."He took his departure abruptly, leaving her scared at the mischief shehad made for him in seeking to save him from it, and that very night hesought out Wilding.But Wilding was from home again. Under its placid surface the WestCountry was in a ferment. And if hitherto Mr. Wilding had disdained theinsistent rumours of Monmouth's coming, his assurance was shaken now byproof that the Government, itself, was stirring; for four companies offoot and a troop of horse had been that day ordered to Taunton by theDeputy-Lieutenant. Wilding was gone with Trenchard to White Lackingtonin a vain hope that there he might find news to confirm his persistingunbelief in any such rashness as was alleged on Monmouth's part.So Blake was forced to wait, but his purpose suffered nothing by delay.Returning on the morrow, he found Mr. Wilding at table with NickTrenchard, and he cut short the greetings of both men. He flung hishat--a black castor trimmed with a black feather--rudely among thedishes on the board."I have come to ask you, Mr. Wilding," said he, "to be so good as totell me the colour of that hat."Mr. Wilding raised one eyebrow and looked aslant at Trenchard, whoseweather-beaten face was suddenly agrin with stupefaction."I could not," said Mr. Wilding, "deny an answer to a question set socourteously." He looked up into Blake's flushed and scowling face withthe sweetest and most innocent of smiles. "You'll no doubt disagree withme," said he, "but I love to meet a man halfway. Your hat, sir, is aswhite as virgin snow."Blake's slow wits were disconcerted for a moment. Then he smiledviciously. "You mistake, Mr. Wilding," said he. "My hat is black."Mr. Wilding looked more attentively at the object in dispute. He was ina trifling mood, and the stupidity of this runagate debtor afforded himopportunities to indulge it. "Why, true," said he, "now that I come tolook, I perceive that it is indeed black."And again was Sir Rowland disconcerted. Still he pursued the lesson hehad taught himself."You are mistaken again," said he, "that hat is green.""Indeed?" quoth Mr. Wilding, like one surprised and he turned toTrenchard, who was enjoying himself. "What is your own opinion of it,Nick?"Thus appealed to, Trenchard's reply was prompt. "Why, since you askme," said he, "my opinion is that it's a noisome thing not meet for agentleman's table." And he took it up, and threw it through the window.Sir Rowland was entirely put out of countenance. Here was a deliberateshifting of the quarrel he had come to pick, which left him all at sea.It was his duty to himself to take offence at Mr. Trenchard's action.But that was not the business on which he had come. He became angry."Blister me!" he cried. "Must I sweep the cloth from the table beforeyou'll understand me?""If you were to do anything so unmannerly I should have you flung outof the house," said Mr. Wilding, "and it would distress me so to treata person of your station and quality. The hat shall serve your purpose,although Mr. Trenchard's concern for my table has removed it. Ourmemories will supply its absence. What colour did you say it was?""I said it was green," answered Blake, quite ready to keep to the point."Nay, I am sure you were wrong," said Wilding with a grave air."Although I admit that since it is your own hat, you should be the bestjudge of its colour, I am, nevertheless, of opinion that it is black.""And if I were to say that it is white?" asked Blake, feeling mightyridiculous."Why, in that case you would be confirming my first impression of it,"answered Wilding, and Trenchard let fly a burst of laughter at sightof the baronet's furious and bewildered countenance. "And since we areagreed on that," continued Mr. Wilding, imperturbable, "I hope you'lljoin us at supper.""I'll be damned," roared Blake, "if ever I sit at table of yours, sir.""Ah!" said Mr. Wilding regretfully. "Now you become offensive.""I mean to be," said Blake."You astonish me!""You lie! I don't," Sir Rowland answered him in triumph. He had got itout at last.Mr. Wilding sat back in his chair, and looked at him, his faceinexpressibly shocked."Will you of your own accord deprive us of your company, Sir Rowland,"he wondered, "or shall Mr. Trenchard throw you after your hat?""Do you mean..." gasped the other, "that you'll ask no satisfaction ofme?""Not so. Mr. Trenchard shall wait upon your friends to-morrow, and Ihope you'll afford us then as felicitous entertainment as you do now."Sir Rowland snorted, and, turning on his heel, made for the door."Give you a good night, Sir Rowland," Mr. Wilding called after him."Walters, you rascal, light Sir Rowland to the door."Poor Blake went home deeply vexed; but it was no more than the beginningof his humiliation at Mr. Wilding's hands--for what can be morehumiliating to a quarrel--seeking man than to have his enemy refuse totreat him seriously? He and Mr. Wilding met next morning, and beforenoon the tale of it had run through Bridgwater that Wild Wilding was athis tricks again. It made a pretty story how twice he had disarmed andeach time spared the London beau, who still insisted--each time morefuriously--upon renewing the encounter, till Mr. Wilding had been forcedto run him through the sword-arm and thus put him out of all case ofcontinuing. It was a story that heaped ridicule upon Sir Rowland and didcredit to Mr. Wilding.Richard heard it, and trembled, enraged and impotent. Ruth heard it, andwas stirred despite herself to a feeling of gratitude towards Wildingfor the patience and toleration he had displayed.There for a while the matter rested, and the days passed slowly. But SirRowland's nature--mean at bottom--was spurred to find him some otherway of wiping out the score that lay 'twixt him and Mr. Wilding, a scoremightily increased by the shame that Mr. Wilding had put upon him inthat encounter from which--whatever the issue--he had looked to cullgreat credit in Ruth's eyes.He had been thinking constantly of the incautious words that Richardhad let fall, thinking of them in conjunction with the startling rumoursthat were now the talk of the whole countryside. He laid two and twotogether, and the four he found them make afforded him some hope. Thenhe realized--as he might have realized before had he been shrewder--thatRichard's mood was one that made him ripe for any villainy. He thoughtthat he was much in error if a treachery existed so black that Richardwould quail before it, if it but afforded him the means of riddinghimself and the world of Mr. Wilding. He was considering how best toapproach the subject, when it happened that one night when Richard satat play with him in his own lodging, the boy grew talkative throughexcess of wine. It happened naturally enough that Richard sought anally in Blake, just as Blake sought an ally in Richard. Indeed, theirfortunes--so far as Ruth was concerned--were bound up together. Thebaronet saw that Richard, half-fuddled, was ripe for any confidencesthat might aim at the destruction of his enemy. He questioned himadroitly, and drew from him the story of the rising that was beingplanned, and of the share that Mr. Wilding--one of the Duke ofMonmouth's chief movement-men--bore in the business that was toward.When, towards midnight, Richard Westmacott went home, he left in SirRowland's hands an instrument which the latter accounted potential notonly for the destruction of Anthony Wilding, but perhaps also for layingthe foundations to the building of his own fortunes anew.CHAPTER VII. THE NUPTIALS OF RUTH WESTMACOTTHere was Sir Rowland Blake in high fettle at knowing himself armed witha portentous weapon for the destruction of Anthony Wilding. Upon closerinspection of it, however, he came to realize--as Richard had realizedearlier--that it was double-edged, and that the wielding of it must befraught with as much danger for Richard as for their common enemy. Forto betray Mr. Wilding and the plot would scarce be possible withoutbetraying young Westmacott, and that was unthinkable, since to ruinRichard--a thing he would have done with a light heart so far as Richardwas himself concerned--would be to ruin his own hopes of winning Ruth.Therefore, during the days that followed, Sir Rowland was forced tofret in idleness what time his wound was healing; but if his arm wasinvalided, his eyes and ears were sound, and he remained watchful for anopportunity to apply the knowledge he had gained. Richard mentioned thesubject no more, so that Blake almost came to wonder whether the boyremembered what in his cups he had betrayed.Meanwhile Mr. Wilding moved serene and smiling on his way. Daily therewere great armfuls of flowers deposited at Lupton House--his lover'soffering to his mistress--and no day went by but that some richer giftaccompanied them. Now it was a collar of brilliants, anon a rope ofpearls, again a priceless ring that had been Mr. Wilding's mother's.Ruth received with reluctance these pledges of his undesired affection.It were idle to reject them, considering that she was to marry him; yetit hurt her sorely to retain them. On her side she made no dispositionsfor the marriage, but went about her daily tasks as though she were toremain a maid at Lupton House for a time as yet indefinite.In Diana, Wilding had--though he was far from guessing it--an entirelyexceptional ally. Lady Horton, too, was favourably disposed towards him.A foolish, worldly woman, who never probed beneath life's surface, norindeed dreamed that anything existed in life beyond that to which herfive senses testified, she was content placidly to contemplate theadvantages that must accrue to her niece from this alliance.And so mother and daughter in Mr. Wilding's absence pleaded his causewith his refractory bride-elect. But they pleaded it to little realpurpose. Something perhaps they achieved in that Ruth grew more orless resigned to the fate that awaited her. By repeating to herself thearguments she had employed to Richard--that she must wed some day, andthat Mr. Wilding would prove no doubt as good a husband as another--shecame in a measure to believe them.Richard meanwhile appeared to avoid her. Lacking the courage to adoptthe heroic measures which at first he had promised, yet had he graceenough to take shame at his inaction. But if he was idle so far asMr. Wilding was concerned, there was no lack of work for him in otherconnections. The clouds of war were gathering in that summer sky, andabout to loose the storm gestating in them upon that fair country ofthe West, and young Westmacott, committed as he stood to the Duke ofMonmouth's party, was forced to take his share in the surreptitiousbustle that was toward. He was away two days in that week, having beensummoned to a meeting of the leading gentlemen of the party at WhiteLackington, where he was forced into the unwelcome company of his futurebrother-in-law, to meet with courteous, deferential treatment from thatimperturbable gentleman.Wilding, indeed, seemed to have forgotten that any quarrel had everexisted between them. For the rest, he came and went, supremely calm, asif he were, and knew himself to be, most welcome at Lupton House. Thricein the course of that week of waiting he rode over from Zoyland Chaseto pay his duty to Mistress Westmacott, and Ruth was persuaded on eachoccasion by her aunt and cousin to receive him. Indeed, how could shewell refuse?His manner was ever all that could be desired. Gallant, affectionate,deferential. He was in word and look and tone Ruth's most obedientservant. Had she been less prejudiced she must have admired theadmirable restraint with which he kept all exultation from his manner,for, after all, it is difficult to force a victory as he had forced his,and not to triumph.It is to be feared that during that week he neglected a good deal of hisduty to the Duke, leaving Trenchard to supply his place and undertaketasks of a seditious nature that should have been his own.At heart, however, in spite of the stories current and the militia atTaunton, Wilding remained convinced--as did most of the other leadingpartisans of the Protestant Cause--that no such madness as thispremature landing could be in contemplation by the Duke. Besides, wereit so, they must unfailingly have definite word of it; and they hadnone.Trenchard was less assured, but Wilding laughed at the old rake'sforebodings, and serenely went about the business of his marriage.On the eve of the wedding he paid Ruth his last visit in the qualityof a lover, and was received by her in the garden. He found her lookingpaler than her wont, and there was a cloud of sadness on her brow, ahaunting sadness in her eyes. It touched him to the soul, and for amoment he wavered in his purpose. He stood beside her--she seated onthe old lichened seat--and a silence fell between them, during whichMr. Wilding's conscience wrestled with his stronger passion. It was hishabit to be glib, talking incessantly what time he was in her company,and seeing to it that his talk was shallow and touched at nothingbelonging to the deeps of human life. Thus was it, perhaps, that thissudden and enduring silence affected her most oddly; it was as if shehad absorbed some notion of what was passing in his mind. She looked upsuddenly into his face, so white and so composed. Their eyes met, and hestooped to her suddenly, his long brown ringlets tumbling forward. Shefeared his kiss, yet never moved, staring up with fixed, dilated eyes asif fascinated by his dark, brooding gaze. He paused, hovering above herupturned face as hovers the hawk above the dove."Child," he said at last, and his voice was soft and winning from verysadness, "child, why do you fear me?"The truth of it went home to her. She feared him; she feared thestrength that lay behind that calm; she feared the masterfulness of hiswild but inscrutably hidden nature; she was afraid to surrender tosuch a man as this, afraid that in the hot crucible of his love her ownnature would be dissolved, transmuted, and rendered part of his. Yet,though the truth was now made plain to her, she thrust it from her."I do not fear you," said she, and her voice at least rang fearlessly."Do you hate me, then?" he asked. Her glance grew troubled and fellaway from his; it sought the calm of the river, gleaming golden in thesunset. There was a pause. Wilding sighed heavily, and straightenedhimself from his bending posture."You should not have sought thus to compel me, she said presently."I own it," he answered a thought bitterly. "I own it. Yet what hope hadI but in compulsion?" She returned him no answer. "You see," he said,with increasing bitterness, "you see, that had I not seized the chancethat was mine to win you by compulsion I had not won you at all.""It might," said she, "have been better so for both of us.""Better for neither," he replied. "Ah, think it not! In time, I swear,you shall not think it. For you shall come to love me, Ruth," he addedwith a note of such assurance that she turned to meet again his gaze.He answered the wordless question of her eyes. "There is," said he, "nolove of man for woman, so that the man be not wholly unworthy, so thathis passion be sincere and strong, that can fail in time to arouseresponse." She smiled a little pitiful smile of unbelief. "Were I aboy," he rejoined, his earnestness vibrating now in a voice that wasusually so calm and level, "offering you protestations of a callowworship, you might have cause to doubt me. But I am a man, Ruth--atried, and haply a sinful man, alas!--a man who needs you, and who willhave you at all costs.""At all costs?" she echoed, and her lip took on a curl. "And you callthis egotism by the name of love! No doubt you are right," she continuedwith an irony that stung him, "for love it is--love of yourself.""And is not all love of another founded upon the love of self?" he askedher, startling her with a question that revealed to her clear-sightedmind a truth undreamed of. "When some day--please Heaven--I come to findfavour in your eyes, and you come to love me, what will it mean but thatyou have come to find me necessary to yourself and to your happiness?Would you deny me now your love if you felt that you had need of mine?I love you because I love myself, you say. I grant it you. But you'llconfess that if you do not love me yet, it is for the same reason, andthat when you do come to love me the reason will be still the same.""You are very sure that I shall come to love you," said she, shiftingwoman-like the ground of argument now that she found insecure the placeon which at first she had taken her stand."Were I not, think you I should compel you to the church to-morrow?"She trembled at his calm assurance. It was as if she almost feared thatwhat he said might come to pass."Since you bear such faith in your heart," said she, "were it notnobler, more generous, that you should set yourself to win me first andwed me afterwards?""It is the course I should, myself, prefer," he answered quietly. "Butit is a course denied me. I was viewed here with disfavour, almostdenied your house. What chance had I whilst I might not come near you,whilst your mind was poisoned against me by the idle, vicious prattlethat goes round and round the countryside, increasing ever in bulk fromconstant repetition?""Do you say that these tales are groundless?" she asked, with a suddenlifting of the eyes, a sudden keen eagerness that did not escape him."I would to God I could," he cried, "since from your manner I see thatwould improve me in your sight. But there is just sufficient truth inthem to forbid me, as I am, I hope, a gentleman, from giving them a fulldenial. Yet in what am I worse than my fellows? Are you of those whothink a husband should come to them as one whose youth has been theyouth of cloistered nun? Heaven knows, I am not one to draw parallels'twixt myself and any other, yet you compel me. Whilst you deny me, youreceive this fellow Blake--a London night-scourer, a broken gamesterwho has given his creditors leg-bail, and who woos you that with yourfortune he may close the doors of the debtor's gaol that's open toreceive him.""This is unworthy in you," she exclaimed, her tone indignant--soindignant that he experienced his first pang of jealousy."It would be were I his rival," he answered quietly. "But I am not. Ihave saved you from becoming the prey of such as he by forcing you tomarry me.""That I may become the prey of such as you, instead," was her retort.He looked at her a moment, smiling sadly. Then, with pardonableself-esteem when we think of what manner of man it was with whom he nowcompared himself, "Surely," said he, "it is better to become the prey ofthe lion than the jackal.""To the victim it can matter little," she answered, and he saw the tearsgathering in her eyes.Compassion moved him. It rose in arms to batter down his will, and in aweaker man had triumphed. Mr. Wilding bent his knee and went down besideher."I swear," he said impassionedly, "that as my wife you shall never countyourself a victim. You shall be honoured by all men, but by none moredeeply than by him who will ever strive to be worthy of the proud titleof your husband." He took her hand and kissed it reverentially. He roseand looked at her. "To-morrow," he said, and bowing low before her wenthis way, leaving her with emotions that found their vent in tears, butdefied her maiden mind to understand them.The morrow came her wedding-day--a sunny day of early June, andRuth--assisted by Diana and Lady Horton--made preparation for hermarriage as spirited women have made preparation for the scaffold,determined to show the world a brave, serene exterior. The sacrifice wasnecessary for Richard's sake. That was a thing long since determined.Yet it would have been some comfort to her to have had Richard at herside; it would have lent her strength to have had his kiss of thanksfor the holocaust which for him she was making of all that a woman holdsmost dear and sacred. But Richard was away--he had been absent sinceyesterday, and none could tell her where he tarried.With Lady Horton and Diana she took her way to Saint Mary's Church atnoon, and there she found Mr. Wilding--very fine in a suit of sky-bluesatin, laced with silver--awaiting her. And with him was old LordGervase Scoresby, his friend and cousin, the very incarnation ofbenignity and ruddy health.For a wonder Nick Trenchard was not at Mr. Wilding's side. But Nickhad definitely refused to be of the party, emphasizing his refusal bycertain choice reflections wholly unflattering to the married state.Some idlers of the town were the only witnesses--and little did theyguess the extent of the tragedy they were witnessing. There was nomusic, and the ceremony was brief and soon at an end. The only touch ofjoy, of festiveness, was that afforded by the choice blooms with whichMr. Wilding had smothered nave and choir and altar-rails. Their perfumehung heavy as incense in the temple."Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?" droned the parson'svoice, and Wilding smiled defiantly a smile which seemed to answer him,"No man. I have taken her for myself."Lord Gervase stood forward as her sponsor, and as in a dream Ruth felther hand lying in Mr. Wilding's cool, firm grasp.The ecclesiastic's voice droned on, his voice hanging like the hum ofsome great Insect upon the scented air. It was accomplished, and theywere welded each to the other until death should part them.Down the festooned nave she came on his arm, her step unfaltering,her face calm; black misery in her heart. Behind followed her aunt andcousin and Lord Gervase. On Mr. Wilding's aquiline face a pale smileglimmered, like a beam of moonlight upon tranquil waters, and it abodethere until they reached the porch and were suddenly confronted by NickTrenchard, red of face for once, perspiring, excited, and dust-stainedfrom head to foot.He had arrived that very instant; and, urged by the fearful news thatbrought him, he had come resolved to pluck Wilding from the altar be theceremony done or not. But in that he reckoned without Mr. Wilding--forhe should have known him better than to have hoped to succeed. Hestepped forward now, and gripped him with his dusty glove by thesleeve of his shimmering bridegroom's coat. His voice came harsh withexcitement and smouldering rage."A word with you, Anthony!"Mr. Wilding turned placidly to regard him. "What now?" he asked, hisbride's hand retained in the crook of his elbow."Treachery!" snapped Trenchard in a whisper. "Hell and damnation! Stepaside, man."Mr. Wilding turned to Lord Gervase, and begged of him to take charge ofMistress Wilding. "I deplore this interruption," he told her, no whitruffled by what he had heard. "But I shall rejoin you soon. Meanwhile,his lordship will do the honours for me." This last he said with hiseyes moving to Lady Horton and her daughter.Lord Gervase, in some surprise, but overruled by his cousin's calm,took the bride on his arm and led her from the churchyard to the waitingcarriage. To this he handed her, and after her her aunt and cousin.Then, mounting himself, they drove away, leaving Wilding and Trenchardamong the tombstones, whither the messenger of evil had meanwhile ledhis friend. Trenchard rapped out his story briefly."Shenke," said he, "who was riding from Lyme with letters for you fromthe Duke, was robbed of his dispatches late last night a mile or so thisside Taunton.""Highwaymen?" inquired Mr. Wilding, his tone calm, though his glance hadhardened."Highwaymen? No! Government agents belike. There were two of them, hesays--for I have the tale from himself--and they met him at the Hare andHounds at Taunton, where he stayed to sup last night. One of them gavehim the password, and he conceived him to be a friend. But afterwards,growing suspicious, he refused to tell them too much. They followedhim, it appears, and on the road they overtook and fell upon him; theyknocked him from his horse, possessed themselves of the contents of hiswallet, and left him for dead--with his head broken."Mr. Wilding drew a sharp breath. His wits worked quickly. He was, herealized, in deadly peril. One thought he gave to Ruth. If the worstcame to pass here was one who would rejoice in her freedom. Thereflection cut through him like a sword. He would be loath to dieuntil he had taught her to regret him. Then his mind returned to whatTrenchard had told him."You said a Government agent," he mused slowly. "How would a Governmentagent know the password?"Trenchard's mouth fell open. "I had not thought..." he began. Then endedwith an oath. "'Tis a traitor from inside."Wilding nodded. "It must be one of those who met at White Lackingtonthree nights ago," he answered.Idlers--the witnesses of the wedding--were watching them with interestfrom the path, and others from over the low wall of the churchyard,as well they might, for Mr. Wilding's behaviour was, for a bridegroom,extraordinary. Trenchard did not relish the audience."We had best away," said he. "Indeed," he added, "we had best outof England altogether before the hue and cry is raised. The bubble'spricked."Wilding's hand fell on his arm, and its grasp was steady. Wilding's eyesmet his, and their gaze was calm."Where have you bestowed this messenger?" quoth he."He is here in Bridgwater, in bed, at the Bell Inn, whence he sent foryou to Zoyland Chase. Suspecting trouble, I rode to him at once myself.""Come, then," said Wilding. "We'll go talk with him. This matter needsprobing ere we decide on flight. You do not seem to have sought todiscover who were the thieves, nor other matters that it may be of useto know.""Rat me!" swore Trenchard. "I was in haste to bring you news ofit. Besides, there were other things to talk of. There is news thatAlbemarle has gone to Exeter, and that Sir Edward Phelips and ColonelLuttrell have been ordered to Taunton by the King."Mr. Wilding stared at him with sudden dismay."Odso!" he exclaimed. "Is King James taking fright at last?" Thenhe shrugged his shoulders and laughed; "Pshaw!" he cried. "They arestarting at a shadow.""Heaven send," prayed Trenchard, "that the shadow does not prove to havea substance immediately behind it.""Folly!" said Wilding. "When Monmouth comes, indeed, we shall not lackforewarning. Come," he added briskly. "We'll see this messenger andendeavour to discover who were these fellows that beset him." And hedrew Trenchard from among the tombstones to the open path, and thus fromthe churchyard and the eyes of the gaping onlookers.CHAPTER VIII. BRIDE AND GROOMAnd so the bridegroom, in all his wedding finery, made his way withTrenchard to the Bell Inn, in the High Street, whilst his bride,escorted by Lord Gervase, was being driven to Zoyland Chase, of whichshe was now the mistress.But she was not destined just yet to cross its threshold. For scarcelywere they over the river when a horseman barred their way, and calledupon the driver to pull up. Lady Horton, in a panic, huddled herselfin the great coach and spoke of tobymen, whilst Lord Gervase thrusthis head from the window to discover that the rider who stayed theirprogress was Richard Westmacott. His lordship hailed the boy, who,thereupon, walked his horse to the carriage door."Lord Gervase," said he, "will you bid the coachman put about and driveto Lupton House?"Lord Gervase stared at him in hopeless bewilderment. "Drive to LuptonHouse?" he echoed. The more he saw of this odd wedding, the less heunderstood of it. It seemed to the placid old gentleman that he wasfallen among a parcel of Bedlamites. "Surely, sir, it is for MistressWilding to say whither she will be driven," and he drew in his head andturned to Ruth for her commands. But, bewildered herself, she had noneto give him. It was her turn to lean from the carriage window to ask herbrother what he meant."I mean you are to drive home again," said he. "There is somethingI must tell you. When you have heard me it shall be yours to decidewhether you will proceed or not to Zoyland Chase."Hers to decide? How was that possible? What could he mean? She pressedhim with some such questions."It means, in short," he answered impatiently, "that I hold yoursalvation in my hands. For the rest, this is not the time or place totell you more. Bid the fellow put about."Ruth sat back and looked once more at her companions. But from none didshe receive the least helpful suggestion. Lady Horton made great prattleto little purpose; Lord Gervase followed her example, whilst Diana,whose alert if trivial mind was the one that might have offeredassistance, sat silent. Ruth pondered. She bethought her of Trenchard'ssudden arrival at Saint Mary's, his dust-stained person and excitedmanner, and of how he had drawn Mr. Wilding aside with news that seemedof moment. And now her brother spoke of saving her; it was a little latefor that, she thought. Outside the coach his voice still urged her, andit grew peevish and angry, as was usual when he was crossed. In the endshe consented to do his will. If she were to fathom this mystery thatwas thickening about her there seemed to be no other course. She turnedto Lord Gervase."Will you do as Richard says?" she begged him.His lordship blew out his chubby cheeks in his astonishment; hehesitated a moment, thinking of his cousin Wilding; then, with a shrug,he leaned from the window and gave the order she desired. The carriageturned about, and with Richard following lumbered back across the bridgeand through the town to Lupton House. At the door Lord Gervase took hisleave of them. He had acted as Ruth had bidden him; but he had no wishto be further involved in this affair, whatever it might portend. Ratherwas it his duty at once to go acquaint Mr. Wilding--if he could findhim--with what was taking place, and leave it to Mr. Wilding to takewhat measures might seem best to him. He told them so, and having toldthem, left them.Richard begged to be alone with his sister, and alone they passedtogether into the library. His manner was restless; he trembled withexcitement, and his eyes glittered almost feverishly."You may have thought, Ruth, that I was resigned to your marriage withthis fellow Wilding," he began; "or that for other reasons I thought itwiser not to interfere. If you thought that you wronged me. I--Blake andI--have been at work for you during these last days, and I rejoiceto say our labours have not been idle." His manner grew assertive,boastful, as he proceeded."You know, of course," said she, "that I am married."He made a gesture of disdain. "No matter," said he exultantly."It matters something, I think," she answered. "O Richard, Richard, whydid you not come to me sooner if you possessed the means of sparing methis thing?"He shrugged impatiently; her remonstrance seemed to throw him out oftemper. "Oons!" he cried; "I came as soon as was ever possible, and,depend upon it, I am not come too late. Indeed, I think I am come in thevery nick of time." He drew a sheet of paper from an inside pocket ofhis coat and slapped it down upon the table. "There is the wherewithalto hang your fine husband," he announced in triumph.She recoiled. "To hang him?" she echoed. With all her aversion to Mr.Wilding it was plain she did not wish him hanged."Aye, to hang him," Richard repeated, and drew himself to the fullheight of his short stature in pride at the thing he had achieved. "Readit."She took the paper almost mechanically, and for some moments she studiedthe crabbed signature before realizing whose it was. Then she started."From the Duke of Monmouth!" she exclaimed.He laughed. "Read it," he bade her again, though there was no need forthe injunction, for already she was deciphering the crabbed hand andthe atrocious spelling--for His Grace of Monmouth's education had beennotoriously neglected. The letter, which was dated from The Hague, wasaddressed "To my good friend W., at Bridgwater." It began, "Sir," spokeof the imminent arrival of His Grace in the West, and gave certaininstructions for the collection of arms and the work of preparing menfor enlistment in his Cause, ending with protestations of His Grace'sfriendship and esteem.Ruth read the epistle twice before its treasonable nature was made clearto her; before she understood the thing that was foreshadowed. Thenshe raised troubled eyes to her brother's face, and in answer to thequestion of her glance he made clear to her the shrewd means by whichthey had become possessed of this weapon that should destroy their enemyMr. Wilding.Blake and he, forewarned--he said not how--of the coming of thismessenger, had lain in wait for him at the Hare and Hounds, at Taunton.They had sought at first to become possessed of the letter withoutviolence. But, having failed in this through having aroused themessenger's suspicions, they had been forced to follow and attack him ona lonely stretch of road, where they had robbed him of the contents ofhis wallet. Richard added that the letter was, no doubt, one of severalsent over by Monmouth to some friend at Lyme for distribution among hisprincipal agents in the West. It was regrettable that they shouldhave endeavoured to take gentle measures with the courier, as this hadforewarned him, and he had apparently been led to remove theletter's outer wrapper--which, no doubt, bore Wilding's full name andaddress--against the chance of such an attack as they had made upon him.Nevertheless, as it was, that letter "to my good friend W.," backed byRichard's and Blake's evidence of the destination intended for it, wouldbe more than enough to lay Mr. Wilding safely by the heels."I would to Heaven," he repeated in conclusion, "I could have come intime to save you from becoming his wife. But at least it is in my powerto make you very speedily his widow.""That," said Ruth, still retaining the letter, "is what you propose todo?""What else?"She shook her head. "It must not be, Richard," she said. "I'll notconsent to it."Taken aback, he stared at her; then laughed unpleasantly. "Odds my life!Are you in love with the man? Have you been fooling us?""No," she answered. "But I'll be no party to his murder.""Murder, quotha! Who talks of murder?" Her shrewd eyes searched hisface. "How came you by your knowledge that this courier rode to Mr.Wilding?" she asked him suddenly, and the swift change that overspreadhis countenance showed her that she had touched him in a tender spot,assured her of the thing she had suddenly come to suspect--a suspicionwhich at the same time started from and explained much that had beenmysterious in Richard's ways of late. "You had knowledge of thisconspiracy," she pursued, answering her own question before he had timeto speak, "because you were one of the conspirators.""At least I am so no longer," he blurted out."I thank Heaven for that, Richard; for your life is very dear to me. Butit would ill become you to make such use as this of the knowledgeyou came by in that manner. It were a Judas's act." He would haveinterrupted her, but her manner dominated him. "You will leave thisletter with me, Richard," she continued."Damn me! no..." he began."Ah, yes, Richard," she insisted. "You will give it to me, and I shallthank you for the gift. It shall prove a weapon for my salvation, neverfear.""It shall, indeed," he cried, with an ugly laugh; "when I have ridden toExeter to lay it before Albemarle.""Not so," she answered him. "It shall be a weapon of defence--not ofoffence. It shall stand as a buckler between me and Mr. Wilding. Trustme, I shall know how to use it.""But there is Blake to consider," he expostulated, growing angry. "I ampledged to him.""Your first duty is to me...""Tut!" he interrupted. "Blake feels that he owes it to his loyalty tolay this letter before the Lord-Lieutenant, and, for that matter, so doI.""Sir Rowland would not cross my wishes in this," she answered him."Folly!" he cried, now thoroughly aroused. "Give me that letter.""Nay, Richard," she answered, and waved him back.But he advanced nevertheless."Give it me," he bade her, waxing fierce. "Gad! It was folly to havetold you of it. I had not done so but that I never thought you such afool as to oppose yourself to the thing we intend.""Listen, Richard..." she besought him.But he was grown insensible to pleadings."Give me that letter," he insisted, and caught her wrist. Her otherhand, however--the one that held the sheet--was already behind her back.The door was suddenly thrust open, and Diana appeared. "Ruth," sheannounced, "Mr. Wilding is here."At the mention of that name, Richard let her free. "Wilding!" heejaculated, his fierceness all blown out of him. He had imagined thatalready Mr. Wilding would be in full flight. Was the fellow mad?"He is following me," said Diana, and, indeed, a step could be heard inthe passage."The letter!" growled Richard in a frenzy, between fear and anger now."Give it me! Give it me, do you hear?""Sh! You'll betray yourself," she cried. "He is here."And at that same moment Mr. Wilding's tall figure, still arrayed in hisbridegroom's finery of sky-blue satin, loomed in the doorway. He wasserene and calm as ever. Neither the discovery of the plot by theabstraction of the messenger's letter, nor Ruth's strange conduct--ofwhich he had heard from Lord Gervase--had sufficed to ruffle, outwardlyat least, the inscrutable serenity of his air and manner. He pausedto make his bow, then advanced into the room, with a passing glance atRichard still spurred and booted and all dust-stained."You appear to have ridden far, Dick," said he, smiling, and Richardshivered in spite of himself at the mocking note that seemed to ringfaintly at the words. "I saw your friend, Sir Rowland, in the garden,"he added. "I think he waits for you."Though Richard could not fail to apprehend the implied dismissal, hewas minded at first to disregard it. But Mr. Wilding, turning, held thedoor, addressing Diana."Mistress Horton," said he, "will you give us leave?"Diana curtsied and passed out, and Mr. Wilding's eye falling upon thelingering Richard at that moment, Richard thought it best to follow herexample. But he went with rage in his heart at being forced to leavethat precious document behind him.As Mr. Wilding, his back to her a moment, closed the door, Ruth slippedthe paper hurriedly into the bosom of her low-necked gown. He turned toher, calm but very grave, and his dark eyes seemed to reproach her."This is ill done, Ruth," said he."Ill done, or well done," she answered him, "done it is, and shall soremain."He raised his brows. "Ah," said he, "I appear, then, to havemisapprehended the situation. From what Gervase told me, I understood itwas your brother forced you to return.""Not forced, sir," she answered him."Induced, then," said he. "It but remains me to induce you to repairwhat I think was a mistake."She shook her head. "I have returned home for good," said she."You'll pardon me," said he, "that I am so egotistical as to preferZoyland Chase to Lupton House. Despite the manifold attractions of thelatter, I do not intend to take up my abode here.""You are not asked to.""What, then?"She hated him for the smile, for his masterful air, which seemed toimply that he humoured her because he scorned to use authority, but thatwhen he did use it, hers must it be to obey him. Again she felt thateverlasting calm, arguing such latent forces, was the thing she hatedmost in him."I think I had best be plain with you," said she. "I have fulfilled mypart of the bargain that we made. I intend to do no more. I promisedthat if you spared my brother, I would go to the altar with you to-day.I have carried out my contract to the letter. It is at an end.""Indeed," said he; "I think it has not yet begun." He advanced towardsher, and took her hand. She yielded it, unwilling though she was. "Thisis unworthy of you, madam," said he, his tone grave and deferential."You think to escape fulfilling the spirit of your bargain by adheringto the letter of it. Not so," he ended, and shook his head, smilinggently. "The carriage is still at your door. You return with me toZoyland Chase to take possession of your home.""You mistake," said she, and tore her hand from his. "You say that whatI have done is unworthy. I admit it; but it is with unworthiness that wemust combat unworthiness. Was your attitude towards me less unworthy?""I'll make amends for it if you'll come home," said he."My home is here. You cannot compel me.""I should be loath to," he admitted, sighing."You cannot," she insisted."I think I can," said he. "There is a law..""A law that will hang you if you invoke it," she cut in quickly. "Thismuch can I safely promise you."She had need to say no more to tell him everything. At all times half aword was as much to Mr. Wilding as a whole sentence to another. She sawthe tightening of his lips, the hardening of his eyes, beyond which hegave no other sign that she had hit him."I see," said he. "It is another bargain that you make. I do suspectthere is some trader's blood in the Westmacott veins. Let us be clear.You hold the wherewithal to ruin me, and you will use it if I insistupon my husband's rights. Is it not so?"She nodded in silence, surprised at the rapidity with which he had readthe situation."I admit," said he, "that you have me between sword and wall." Helaughed shortly. "Let me know more," he begged her. "Am I to understandthat so long as I leave you in peace--so long as I do not insist uponyour becoming my wife in more than name--you will not wield the weaponthat you hold?""You are to understand so," she answered.He took a turn in the room, very thoughtful. Not of himself was hethinking now, but of the Duke of Monmouth. Trenchard had told him someugly truths that morning of how in his love-making he appeared to haveshipwrecked the Cause ere it was well launched. If this letter gotto Whitehall there was no gauging--ignorant as he was of what was init--the ruin that might follow; but they had reason to fear the worst.He saw his duty to the Duke most clearly, and he breathed a prayer ofthanks that Richard had chosen to put that letter to such a use as this.He knew himself checkmated; but he was a man who knew how to bear defeatin a becoming manner. He turned suddenly."The letter is in your hands?" he inquired."It is," she answered."May I see it?" he asked.She shook her head--not daring to show it or betray its whereabouts lesthe should use force to become possessed of it--a thing, indeed, that wasvery far from his purpose.He considered a moment, his mind intent now rather upon the Duke'sinterest than his own."You know," quoth he, "the desperate enterprise to which I standcommitted. But it is a bargain between us that you do not betray me northat enterprise so long as I leave you rid of my presence.""That is the bargain I propose," said she.He looked at her a moment with hungry eyes, and she found his glancealmost more than she could bear, so strong was its appeal. Besides,it may be that she was a thought beglamoured by the danger in which hestood, which seemed to invest him with a certain heroic dignity."Ruth," he said at length, "it may well be that that which you desiremay speedily come to pass; it may well be that in the course of thisrebellion that is hatching you may be widowed. But at least I know thatif my head falls it will not be my wife who has betrayed me to the axe.For that much, believe me, I am supremely grateful."He advanced. He took her unresisting hand again and bore it to his lips,bowing low before her. Then erect and graceful he turned on his heel andleft her.CHAPTER IX. MR. TRENCHARD'S COUNTERSTROKENow, however much it might satisfy Mr. Wilding to have Ruth's word forit that so long as he left her in peace neither he nor the Cause had anybetrayal to fear from her, Mr. Trenchard was of a very different mind.He fumed and swore and worked himself into a very passion. "Zoons,man!" he cried, "it would mean utter ruin to you if that letter reachedWhitehall.""I realize it; but my mind is easy. I have her promise.""A woman's promise!" snorted Trenchard, and proceeded with greatcircumstance of expletives to damn "everything that daggled apetticoat.""Your fears are idle," Wilding assured him. "What she says, she willdo.""And her brother?" quoth Trenchard. "Have you bethought you of thatcanary-bird? He'll know the letter's whereabouts. He has cause to fearyou more than ever now. Are you sure he'll not be making use of it tolay you by the heels?"Mr. Wilding smiled upon the fury provoked by Trenchard's concern andlove for him. "She has promised," he said with an insistent faith thatwas fuel to Trenchard's anger, "and I can depend her word.""So cannot I," snapped his friend."The thing that plagues me most," said Wilding, ignoring the remark, "isthat we are kept in ignorance of the letter's contents at a time when wemost long for news. Not a doubt but it would have enabled us to set ourminds at ease on the score of these foolish rumours.""Aye--or else confirmed them," said pessimistic Trenchard. He wagged hishead. "They say the Duke has put to sea already.""Folly!" Wilding protested."Whitehall thinks otherwise. What of the troops at Taunton?""More folly.""Well-I would you had that letter.""At least," said Wilding, "I have the superscription, and we know fromShenke that no name was mentioned in the letter itself.""There's evidence enough without it," Trenchard reminded him, and fellsoon after into abstraction, turning over in his mind a notion withwhich he had suddenly been inspired. That notion kept Trenchard secretlyoccupied for a couple of days; but in the end he succeeded in perfectingit.Now it befell that towards dusk one evening early in the week RichardWestmacott went abroad alone, as was commonly his habit, his goal beingthe Saracen's Head, where he and Sir Rowland spent many a night overwine and cards--to Sir Rowland's moderate profit, for he had not playedthe pigeon in town so long without having acquired sufficient knowledgeto enable him to play the rook in the country. As Westmacott was passingup the High Street, a black shadow fell athwart the light that streamedfrom the door of the Bell Inn, and out through the doorway lurched Mr.Trenchard a thought unsteadily to hurtle so violently against Richardthat he broke the long stem of the white clay pipe he was carrying. NowRichard was not to know that Mr. Trenchard--having informed himself ofMr. Westmacott's evening habits--had been waiting for the past half-hourin that doorway hoping that Mr. Westmacott would not depart this eveningfrom his usual custom. Another thing that Mr. Westmacott was not toknow--considering his youth--was the singular histrionic ability whichthis old rake had displayed in those younger days of his when he hadbeen a player, and the further circumstance that he had excelled inthose parts in which ebriety was to be counterfeited. Indeed, we have iton the word of no less an authority on theatrical matters than Mr. Pepysthat Mr. Nicholas Trenchard's appearance as Pistol in "Henry IV" in theyear of the blessed Restoration was the talk alike of town and court.Mr. Trenchard steadied himself from the impact, and, swearing a roundand awful Elizabethan oath, accused the other of being drunk, thenstruck an attitude to demand with truculence, "Would ye take the wall o'me, sir?"Richard hastened to make himself known to this turbulent roysterer, whostraightway forgot his grievance to take Westmacott affectionately bythe hand and overwhelm him with apologies. And that done, Trenchard--whoaffected the condition known as maudlin drunk--must needs protest almostin tears how profound was his love for Richard, and insist that the boyreturn with him to the Bell Inn, that they might pledge each other.Richard, himself sober, was contemptuous of Trenchard so obviouslyobfuscated. At first it was his impulse to excuse himself, as possiblyBlake might be already waiting for him; but on second thoughts,remembering that Trenchard was Mr. Wilding's most intimate famulus, itoccurred to him that by a little crafty questioning he might succeed insmoking Mr. Wilding's intentions in the matter of that letter--for fromhis sister he had failed to get satisfaction. So he permitted himself tobe led indoors to a table by the window which stood vacant. There wereat the time a dozen guests or so in the common-room. Trenchard bawledfor wine and brandy, and for all that he babbled in an irresponsible,foolish manner of all things that were of no matter, yet not the mostadroit of pumping could elicit from him any such information as Richardsought. Perforce young Westmacott must remain, plying him with more andmore drink--and being plied in his turn--to the end that he might notwaste the occasion.An hour later found Richard much the worse for wear, and Trenchardcertainly no better. Richard forgot his purpose, forgot that Blakewaited for him at the Saracen's Head. And now Trenchard seemed to bepulling himself together."I want to talk to you, Richard," said he, and although thick, there wasin his voice a certain impressive quality that had been absent hitherto."'S a rumour current." He lowered his voice to a whisper almost, and,leaning across, took his companion by the arm. He hiccoughed noisily,then began again. "'S a rumour current, sweetheart, that you'redisaffected."Richard started, and his mind flapped and struggled like a trapped birdto escape the meshes of the wine, to the end that he might convincinglydefend himself from such an imputation--so dangerously true."'S a lie!" he gasped.Trenchard shut one eye and owlishly surveyed his companion with theother. "They say," he added, "that you're for forsaking 'Duke's party.""Villainous!" Richard protested. "I'll sli' throat of any man 't saysso." And draining the pewter at his elbow, he smashed it down on thetable to emphasize his seriousness.Trenchard replenished it with the utmost promptness, then sat back inhis tall chair and pulled a moment at the fresh pipe with which he hadequipped himself."I think I espy,"' he quoted presently, "'virtue and valour crouchedin thine eye.' And yet... and yet... if I had cause to think ittrue, I'd... I'd run you through the vitals--jus' so," and he proddedRichard's waistcoat with the point of his pipe-stem. His swarthy facedarkened, his eyes glittered fiercely. "Are ye sure ye're norrer foultraitor?" he demanded suddenly. "Are y' sure, for if ye're not..."He left the terrible menace unuttered, but it was none the lessunderstood. It penetrated the vinous fog that beset the brain ofRichard, and startled him."'Swear I'm not!" he cried. "'Swear mos' solemnly I'm not.""Swear?" echoed Trenchard, and his scowl grew darker still. "Swear? Aman may swear and yet lie--'a man may smile and smile and be a villain.'I'll have proof of your loyalty to us. I'll have proof, or as there's aheaven above and a hell below, I'll rip you up."His mien was terrific, and his voice the more threatening in that it wasnot raised above a whisper.Richard sat back appalled, afraid."Wha'... what proof'll satisfy you?" he asked.Trenchard considered it, pulling at his pipe again. "Pledge me theDuke," said he at length. "Ther's truth 'n wine. Pledge me the Duke andconfusion to His Majesty the goldfinch." Richard reached for his pewter,glad that the test was to be so light. "Up on your feet, man," grumbledTrenchard. "On your feet, and see that your words have a ring of truthin them."Richard did as he was bidden, the little reason left him beingconcentrated wholly on the convincing of his fellow tippler. He rose tohis feet, so unsteadily that his chair fell over with a bang. He neverheeded it, but others in the room turned at the sound, and a hush fellin the chamber. Dominating this came Richard's voice, strident withintensity, if thick of utterance."Down with Popery, and God save the Protestant Duke!" he cried. "Downwith Popery!" And he looked at Trenchard for applause, and assurancethat Trenchard no longer thought there was cause to quarrel with him.Behind him there was a stir in the room that went unheeded by the boy.Men nudged their neighbours; some looked frightened and some grinned atthe treasonable words.A swift change came over Trenchard. His drunkenness fell from him likea discarded mantle. He sat like a man amazed. Then he heaved himself tohis feet in a fury, and smashed down his pipestem on the wooden table,sending its fragments flying."Damn me!" he roared. "Have I sat at table with a traitor?" And hethrust at Richard with his open palm, lightly yet with sufficient forceto throw Richard off his precarious balance and send him sprawling onthe sanded floor. Men rose from the tables about and approached them,some few amused, but the majority very grave. Dodsley, the landlord,came hurrying to assist Richard to his feet."Mr. Westmacott," he whispered in the rash fool's ear, "you were bestaway."Richard stood up, leaning his full weight upon the arm the landlord hadabout his waist. He passed a hand over his brow, as if to brush asidethe veil that obscured his wits. What had happened? What had he said?What had Trenchard done? Why did these fellows stand and gape at him? Heheard his companion's voice, raised to address the company."Gentlemen," he heard him say, "I trust there is none present willimpute to me any share in such treasonable sentiments as Mr. Westmacotthas expressed. But if there is any who questions my loyalty, I havea convincing argument for him--in my scabbard." And he struck hissword-hilt with his fist.Then he clapped on his hat, aslant over the locks of his golden wig,and, taking up his whip, he moved with leisurely dignity towards thedoor. He looked back with a sardonic smile at the ado he was leavingbehind him, listened a moment to the voices that already were beingraised in excitement, then closed the door and made his way brisklyto the stable-yard, where he called for his horse. He rode out ofBridgwater ten minutes later, and took the road to Taunton as the moonwas rising big and yellow over the hills on his left. He reached Tauntontowards ten o'clock that night, having ridden hell-to-leather. Hisfirst visit was to the Hare and Hounds, where Blake and Westmacott hadovertaken the courier. His next to the house where Sir Edward Phelipsand Colonel Luttrell--the gentlemen lately ordered to Taunton by HisMajesty--had their lodging.The fruits of Mr. Trenchard's extraordinary behaviour that night wereto be seen at an early hour on the following day, when a constable andthree tything-men came with a Lord-Lieutenant's warrant to arrest Mr.Richard Westmacott on a charge of high treason. They found the young manstill abed, and most guilty was his panic when they bade him rise anddress himself--though little did he dream of the full extent to whichMr. Trenchard had enmeshed him, or indeed that Mr. Trenchard had anyhand at all in this affair. What time he was getting into his clotheswith a tything-man outside his door and another on guard under hiswindow, the constable and his third myrmidon made an exhaustive searchof the house. All they found of interest was a letter signed "Monmouth,"which they took from the secret drawer of a secretary in the library;but that, it seemed, was all they sought, for having found it, theyproceeded no further with their reckless and destructive ransacking.With that letter and the person of Richard Westmacott, the constable andhis men took their departure, and rode back to Taunton, leaving alarmand sore distress at Lupton House. In her despair poor Ruth was all forfollowing her brother, in the hope that at least by giving evidenceof how that letter came into his possession she might do something toassist him. But knowing, as she did, that he had had his share in thetreason that was hatching, she had cause to fear that his guilt wouldnot lack for other proofs. It was Diana who urged her to repair insteadto the only man upon whose resource she might depend, provided he werewilling to exert it. That man was Anthony Wilding, and whether Dianaurged it from motives of her own or out of concern for Richard, it wouldbe difficult to say with certainty.The very thought of going to him for aid, after all that had passed, wasrepugnant to Ruth. And yet what choice had she? Convinced by her cousinand urged by her affection and duty to Richard, she repressed heraversion, and, calling for a horse, rode out to Zoyland Chase, attendedby a groom. Wilding by good fortune was at home, hard at work upon amass of documents in that same library where she had talked with him onthe occasion of her first visit to his home--to the home of which sheremembered that she was now, herself, the mistress. He was preparingfor circulation in the West a mass of libels and incendiary pamphletscalculated to forward the cause of the Protestant Duke.Dissembling his surprise, he bade old Walters--who left her waiting inthe hall whilst he went to announce her--to admit her instantly, and headvanced to the door to receive and welcome her."Ruth," said he, and his face was oddly alight, "you have come at last."She smiled a wan smile of self-pity. "I have been constrained," saidshe, and told him what had happened; that her brother had been arrestedfor high treason, and that the constable in searching the house had comeupon the Monmouth letter she had locked away in her desk."And not a doubt," she ended, "but it will be believed that it was toRichard the letter was indited by the Duke. You will remember thatits only address was 'to my good friend, W.,' and that will stand forWestmacott as well as Wilding."Mr. Wilding was fain to laugh at the irony of this surprising turn ofthings of which she brought him news; for he had neither knowledge norsuspicion of the machinations of his friend Trenchard, to which theseevents were due. But noting and respecting her anxiety for her brother,he curbed his natural amusement."It is a judgment upon you," said he, nevertheless."Do you exult?" she asked indignantly."No; but I cannot repress my admiration for the ways of Divine Justice.If you are come to me for advice, I can but suggest that you shouldfollow your brother's captors to Taunton, and inform the lieutenants ofhow the letter came into your power."She looked at him in anger almost at what seemed a callousness. "Wouldhe believe me, think you?""Belike he would not," said Mr. Wilding. "You can but try.""If I told them it was addressed to you," she said, eyeing him sternly,"does it not occur to you that they would send for you to question you,and that if they did so, as you are a gentleman you could not lie awaymy brother's life.""Why, yes," said he quite calmly, "it does occur to me. But does it notoccur to you that by the time they came here they would find me gone?"He laughed at her dismay. "I thank you, madam, for this warning," headded. "I think I'll bid them saddle for me without delay. Too longalready have I tarried.""And must Richard hang?" she asked him fiercely.Mr. Wilding produced a snuffbox of tortoise shell and gold. He opened itdeliberately. "If he does, you'll admit that he will hang on the gallowsthat he has built himself--although intended for another. I'faith! He'snot the first booby to be caught in his own springe. There is in this ameasure of poetic justice. Poetry and justice! Do you know, Ruth,they are two things I have ever loved?" And he took a pinch of choiceBergamot."Will you be serious?" she demanded."Trenchard would tell you that it were to make an exception from therule of my life," he assured her, smiling. "Yet even that might I do atyour bidding.""But this is a serious matter," she told him angrily."For Richard," he acknowledged, closing his snuffbox with a snap. "Tellme, what would you have me do?"Since he asked her thus, she answered him in two words. "Save him.""At the cost of my own neck?" quoth he. "The price is high," he remindedher. "Do you think that Richard is quite worth it?""And are you to save yourself at the cost of his?" shecounter-questioned. "Are you capable of such a baseness?"He looked at her thoughtfully a moment. "You have not reflected," saidhe slowly, "that in this affair is involved more than mine or Richard'slife. There is a great cause weighing in the balance against allpersonal considerations. If I accounted Richard of more value toMonmouth than I am myself, I should not hesitate in riding to sethim free by taking his place. As it is, however, I think I am of thegreatest conceivable importance to His Grace, whilst if twenty Richardsperished--frankly--their loss would be something of a gain, for Richardhas played a traitor's part already. That is with me the first of allconsiderations.""Am I of no consideration to you?" she asked him. And in an agony ofterror for her brother she now approached him, and, obeying a suddenimpulse, cast herself upon her knees before him. "Listen!" she cried."Not thus," said he, a frown between his eyes. He took her by the elbowsand gently but very firmly brought her to her feet again. "It is notfitting you should kneel save at your prayers."She was standing now, and very close to him, his hands still held herelbows, though their touch was so light that she scarce felt it.To release them was easy, and the next second her hands were on hisshoulders, her brave eyes raised to him."Mr. Wilding," she implored him, "you'll not let Richard be destroyed?"He looked down at her with kindling glance, his arms slipped round herlissom waist. "It is hard to deny you, Ruth," said he. "Yet not my loveof my own life compels me; but my duty, my loyalty to the cause to whichI am pledged. I were a traitor were I now to place myself in peril."She pressed against him, her face so close to his that her breath fannedhis cheek, whither a faint colour crept in quick response. Despiteherself almost, instinctively, unconsciously, she exerted the weapons ofher sex to bend him to her will."You say you love me," she whispered. "Prove it me now, and I willbelieve you."Ah!" he sighed. "And believing me? What then?"He had himself grimly in hand, yet feared he should not prove strongenough to hold himself for long."You... you shall find me your... dutiful wife," she faltered,crimsoning.His arms tightened about her; he crushed her to him, he bent his head tohers and his lips burnt the lips she yielded to him as though they hadbeen living fire.Anon, she was to weep in shame--in shame and in astonishment--at thatinstant of surrender, but for the moment she had no thought save for herbrother. Exultation filled her. She accounted that she had conquered,and she gloried in the power her beauty gave her, a power that hadsufficed to melt to water the hard-frozen purposes of this self-willedman. The next instant, however, she was cold again with dismay andnewborn terror. He unclasped her arms, he drew back, shaking off thehands she had rested upon his shoulders. His white face--the flush hadfaded from it again--smiled a thought disdainfully."You bargain with me," he said. "But I have some knowledge of your waysof trading. They are overshrewd for an honest gentleman.""You mean," she gasped, her hand pressed to her heart, her face adeathly white, "you mean that you'll not save him?""I mean," said he, "that I will have no further bargains with you."There was such hard finality in his tone that she recoiled, beaten andwithout power, to return to the assault. She had played and lost. Shehad yielded her lips to his kisses, and--husband though he might be inname--shame was her only guerdon.One look she gave him from out of that face so white and pitiful, thenwith a shudder turned from him and fled his presence. He sprang afterher as the door closed, then checked and stood in thought, very grim forone who professed to bestow no seriousness on the affairs of life. Thenhe returned slowly to his writing-table, and rummaged there among thepapers with which it was encumbered, seeking something of which he nowhad need. Through the open window he heard the retreating beat of herhorse's hoofs. He sighed and sat down heavily, to take his long squarechin in his hand and stare before him at the sunlight on the lawnoutside.And whilst he sat thus, Ruth made all haste back to Lupton House to tellof the failure that had attended her. There was nothing left her nowbut to embark upon the forlorn hope of following Richard to Taunton, tooffer her evidence of how the incriminating letter had come to be lockedin the drawer in which the constable had discovered it. Diana met herwith a face as white as her own and infinitely more startled. She hadjust learnt that Sir Rowland Blake had been arrested also and thathe had been carried to Taunton together with Richard, and, as aconsequence, she was as eager now that Ruth should repair to Albemarleas she had erstwhile been earnest in urging her to seek out Mr. Wilding;indeed, Diana went so far as to offer to accompany her, an offer thatRuth gladly, gratefully accepted.Within an hour Ruth and Diana--in spite of all that poor, docile LadyHorton had said to stay them--were riding to Taunton, attended by thesame groom who had so lately accompanied his mistress to Zoyland Chase.CHAPTER X. THEIR OWN PETARDIn a lofty, spacious room of the town hall at Taunton sat Sir EdwardPhelips and Colonel Luttrell to dispense justice, and with them, flankedby one of them on either side of him, sat Christopher Monk, Duke ofAlbemarle, Lord-Lieutenant of Devonshire, who had been summoned inall haste from Exeter that he might be present at an examination whichpromised to be of so vast importance. The three sat at a long table atthe room's end, attended by two secretaries.Before them, guarded by constable and tything-men, weaponless, theirhands pinioned behind them--Blake's arm was healed by now--stood Mr.Westmacott and his friend Sir Rowland to answer this grave charge.Richard, not knowing who might have betrayed him and to what extent, wasvery fearful--having through his connection with the Cause every reasonso to be. Blake, on the other hand, conscious of his innocence of anyplotting, was impatient of his position, and a thought contemptuous.It was he who, upon being ushered by the constable and his men into theaugust presence of the Lord-Lieutenant, clamoured to know precisely ofwhat he was accused that he might straightway clear himself.Albemarle reared his great massive head, smothered in a mighty blackperuke, and scowled upon the florid London beau. A black-visagedgentleman was Christopher Monk. His pendulous cheeks, it is true, wereof a sallow pallor, but what with his black wig, black eyebrows, darkeyes, and the blue-black tint of shaven beard on his great jaw and upperlip, he presented an appearance sombrely sinister. His netherlip wasthick and very prominent; deep creases ran from the corners of his mouthadown his heavy chin; his eyes were dull and lack-lustre, with greatpouches under them. In the main, the air of this son of the greatParliamentarian general was stupid, dull, unprepossessing.The creases of his mouth deepened as Blake protested against what hetermed this outrage that had been done him; he sneered ponderously,thrusting further forward his heavily undershot jowl."We are informed, sir, of your antecedents," he staggered Blake byanswering. "We have learnt the reason why you left London and yourcreditors, and in all my life, sir, I have never known a man more readyto turn his hand to treason than a broken gamester. Your kind turns byinstinct to such work as this, as a last resource for the mending ofbattered fortunes."Blake crimsoned from chin to brow. "I'm forejudged, it, seems," he madeanswer haughtily, tossing his fair locks, his blue eyes glaring upon hisjudges. "May I, at least, know the name of my accuser?""You shall receive impartial justice at our hands," put in Phelips,whose manner was of a dangerous mildness. "Depend on that. Not onlyshall you know the name of your accuser, but you shall be confronted byhim. Meanwhile, sirs"--and his glance strayed from Blake's flushed andangry countenance to Richard's, pale and timid--"meanwhile, are we tounderstand that you deny the charge?""I have heard none as yet," said Sir Rowland insolently.Albemarle turned to one of the secretaries. "Read them the indictment,"said he, and sank back in his chair, his dull glance upon the prisoners,whilst the clerk in a droning voice read from a document which he tookup. It impeached Sir Rowland Blake and Mr. Richard Westmacott of holdingtreasonable communication with James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, and ofplotting against His Majesty's life and throne and the peace of HisMajesty's realms.Blake listened with unconcealed impatience to the farrago of legalphrases, and snorted contemptuously when the reading came to an end.Albemarle looked at him darkly. "I do thank God," said he, "that throughMr. Westmacott's folly has this hideous plot, this black and damnabletreason, been brought to light in time to enable us to stamp out thisfire ere it is well kindled. Have you aught to say, sir?""I have to say that the whole charge a foul and unfounded lie," said SirRowland bluntly: "I never plotted in my life against anything but my ownprosperity, nor against any man but myself."Albemarle smiled coldly at his colleagues, then turned to Westmacott."And you, sir?" he said. "Are you as stubborn as your friend?""I incontinently deny the charge," said Richard, and he contrived thathis voice should ring bold and resolute."A charge built on air," sneered Blake, "which the first breath of truthshould utterly dispel. We have heard the impeachment. Will Your Gracewith the same consideration permit us to see the proofs that we may laybare their falseness? It should not be difficult.""Do you say there is no such plot as is here alleged?" quoth the Duke,and smote a paper sharply.Blake shrugged his shoulders. "How should I know?" he asked. "I say Ihave no share in any, that I am acquainted with none.""Call Mr. Trenchard," said the Duke quietly, and an usher who had stoodtamely by the door at the far end of the room departed on the errand.Richard started at the mention of that name. He had a singular dread ofMr. Trenchard.Colonel Luttrell--lean and wiry--now addressed the prisoners, Blake moreparticularly. "Still," said he, "you will admit that such a plot may,indeed, exist?""It may, indeed, for aught I know--or care," he added incautiously.Albemarle smote the table with a heavy hand. "By God!" he cried in thatdeep booming voice of his, "there spoke a traitor! You do not care, yousay, what plots may be hatched against His Majesty's life and crown! Yetyou ask me to believe you a true and loyal subject."Blake was angered; he was at best a short-tempered man. Deliberately hefloundered further into the mire."I have not asked Your Grace to believe me anything," he answered hotly."It is all one to me what Your Grace believes me. I take it I have notbeen fetched hither to be confronted with what Your Grace believes. Youhave preferred a lying charge against me; I ask for proofs, not YourGrace's beliefs and opinions.""By God, sir, you are a daring rogue!" cried Albemarle.Sir Rowland's eyes blazed. "Anon, Your Grace, when, having failed ofyour proofs, you shall be constrained to restore me to liberty, I shallask Your Grace to unsay that word."Albemarle stared, confounded, and in that moment the door opened, andTrenchard sauntered in, cane in hand, his hat under his arm, a wickedsmile on his wizened face.Leaving Blake's veiled threat unanswered, the Duke turned to the oldrake. "These rogues," said he, pointing to the prisoners, "demand proofsere they will admit the truth of the impeachment.""Those proofs," said Trenchard, "are already in Your Grace's hands.""Aye, but they have asked to be confronted with their accuser."Trenchard bowed. "Is it your wish, then, that I recite for them thecounts on which I have based the accusation I laid before Your Grace?""If you will condescend so far," said Albemarle."Blister me...!" roared Blake, when the Duke interrupted him."By God, sir!" he cried, "I'll have no such disrespectful language here.You'll observe the decency of speech and forbear from profanities, youdamned rogue, or by God! I'll commit you forthwith.""I will endeavour," said Blake, with a sarcasm lost on Albemarle, "tofollow Your Grace's lofty example.""You will do well, sir," said the Duke, and was shocked that Trenchardshould laugh at such a moment."I was about to protest, sir," said Blake, "that it is monstrousI should be accused by Mr. Trenchard. He has but the slightestacquaintance with me."Trenchard bowed to him across the chamber. "Admitted, sir," saidhe. "What should I be doing in bad company?" An answer this that setAlbemarle bawling with laughter. Trenchard turned to the Duke. "I willbegin, an it please Your Grace, with the expressions used last night inmy presence at the Bell Inn at Bridgwater by Mr. Richard Westmacott, andI will confine myself strictly to those matters on which my testimonycan be corroborated by that of other witnesses."Colonel Luttrell interrupted him to turn to Richard. "Do you recallthose expressions, sir?" he asked him.Richard winced under the question. Nevertheless, he braced himself tomake the best defence he could. "I have not yet heard," said he, "whatthose expressions were; nor when I hear them must it follow that Irecognize them as my own. I must admit to having taken more wine,perhaps, than... than..." Whilst he sought the expression that he neededTrenchard cut in with a laugh. "In vino veritas, gentlemen," andHis Grace and Sir Edward nodded sagely; Luttrell preserved a stolidexterior. He seemed less prone than his colleagues to forejudging."Will you repeat the expressions used by Mr. Westmacott?" Sir Edwardbegged."I will repeat the one that, to my mind, matters most." Mr. Westmacott,getting to his feet and in a loud voice, exclaimed, "God save theProtestant Duke!""Do you admit it, sir?" thundered Albemarle, his eyes glowering uponRichard hesitated a moment, pale and trembling."You will waste breath in denying it," said Trenchard suavely, "for Ihave a drawer from the Bell Inn, and two gentlemen who overheard youwaiting outside.""I'faith, sir," cried Blake, "what treason was therein that? If he...""Silence!" thundered Albemarle. "Let Mr. Westmacott speak for himself."Richard, inspired by the defence Blake had begun, took the same line ofargument. "I admit that in the heat of wine I may have used such words,"said he. "But I deny their intent to be treasonable. There are many menwho drink to the prosperity of the late Kings's son...""Natural son, sir; natural son," Albemarle amended. "It is treason tospeak of him otherwise.""It will be a treason presently to draw breath," sneered Blake."If it be," said Trenchard, "it is a treason you'll not be longcommitting.""Faith, you are right, Mr. Trenchard," said the Duke with a laugh.Indeed, he found Mr. Trenchard a most pleasant and facetious gentleman."Still," insisted Richard, endeavouring in spite of these irrelevanciesto make good his point, "there be many men who drink daily to theprosperity of the late King's natural son.""Aye, sir," answered Albemarle; "but not his prosperity in horrid plotsagainst the life of our beloved sovereign.""True, Your Grace; very true," purred Sir Edward. "It was not so I meantto toast him," cried Richard. Albemarle made an impatient gesture,and took up a sheet of paper. "How, then," he asked, "comes thisletter--this letter which makes plain the treason upon which the Dukeof Monmouth is embarked, just as it makes plain your participation init--how comes this letter to be found in your possession?" And he wavedthe letter in the air.Richard went the colour of ashes. He faltered a moment, then took refugein the truth, for all that he knew beforehand that the truth was boundto ring more false than any lie he could invent."That letter was not addressed to me," he stammered.Albemarle read the subscription, "To my good friend W., at Bridgwater."He looked up, a heavy sneer thrusting his heavy lip still further out."What do you say to that? Does not 'W' stand for Westmacott?""It does not.""Of course not," said Albemarle with heavy sarcasm. "It stands forWilkins, or Williams, or... or... What-not.""Indeed, I can bear witness that it does not," exclaimed Sir Rowland."Be silent, sir, I tell you!" bawled the Duke at him again. "You shallbear witness soon enough, I promise you. To whom, then," he resumed,turning again to Richard, "do you say that this letter was addressed?""To Mr. Wilding--Mr. Anthony Wilding," Richard answered."I would have Your Grace to observe," put in Trench ard quietly, "thatMr. Wilding, properly speaking, does not reside in Bridgwater.""Tush!" cried Albemarle; "the rogue but mentions the first name with a'W' that occurs to him. He's not even an ingenious liar. And how, sir,"he asked Richard, "does it come to be in your possession, having beenaddressed, as you say, to Mr. Wilding?""Aye, sir," said Sir Edward, blinking his weak eyes. "Tell us that."Richard hesitated again, and looked at Blake. Blake, who by now hadcome to realize that his friend's affairs were not mended by hisinterruptions, moodily shrugged his shoulders, scowling."Come, sir," said Colonel Luttrell, engagingly, "answer the question.""Aye," roared Albemarle; "let your invention have free rein."Again poor Richard sought refuge in the truth. "We--Sir Rowland here andI--had reason to suspect that he was awaiting such a letter.""Tell us your reasons, sir, if we are to credit you," said the Duke, andit was plain he mocked the prisoner. It was, moreover, a request thatstaggered Richard. Still, he sought to find a reason that should soundplausible."We inferred it from certain remarks that Mr. Wilding let fall in ourpresence.""Tell us the remarks, sir," the Duke insisted."Indeed, I do not call his precise words to mind, Your Grace. But theywere such that we suspicioned him.""And you would have me believe that hearing words which awoke in yousuch grave suspicions, you kept your suspicions and straightway forgotthe words. You're but an indifferent liar."Trenchard, who was standing by the long table, leaned forward now."It might be well, an it please Your Grace," said he, "to waive thepoint, and let us come to those matters which are of greater moment. Lethim tell Your Grace how he came by the letter.""Aye," said Albemarle. "We do but waste time. Tell us, then, how camethe letter into your hands?""With Sir Rowland, here, I robbed the courier as he was riding fromTaunton to Bridgwater."Albemarle laughed, and Sir Edward smiled. "You robbed him, eh?" said HisGrace. "Very well. But how did it happen that you knew he had the letterupon him, or was it that you were playing the hightobymen, and that inrobbing him you hoped to find other matters?""Not so, sir," answered Richard. "I sought but the letter.""And how knew you that he carried it? Did you learn that, too, from Mr.Wilding's indiscretion?""Your Grace has said it.""'Slife! What an impudent rogue have we here!" cried the angry Duke,who conceived that Richard was purposely dealing in effrontery. "Mr.Trenchard, I do think we are wasting time. Be so good as to confoundthem both with the truth of this matter.""That letter," said Trenchard, "was delivered to them at the Hare andHounds, here at Taunton, by a gentleman who put up at the inn, and wasthere joined by Mr. Westmacott and Sir Rowland Blake. They openedthe conversation with certain cant phrases very clearly intended aspasswords. Thus: the prisoners said to the messenger, as they seatedthemselves at the table he occupied, 'You have the air, sir, of beingfrom overseas,' to which the courier answered, 'Indeed, yes. I am fromHolland. 'From the land of Orange,' says one of the prisoners. 'Aye, andother things,' replies the messenger. 'There is a fair wind blowing,' headds; to which one of the prisoners, I believe it was Sir Rowland, makesanswer, 'Mayit prosper the Protestant Duke and blow Popery to hell.'Thereupon the landlord caught some mention of a letter, but theseplotters, perceiving that they were perhaps being overheard, sent himaway to fetch them wine. A half-hour later the messenger took his leave,and the prisoners followed a very few minutes afterwards."Albemarle turned to the prisoners. "You have heard Mr. Trenchard'sstory. How do you say--is it true or untrue?""You will waste breath in denying it," Trenchard took it again uponhimself to admonish them. "For I have with me the landlord of the Hareand Hounds, who will corroborate, upon oath, what I have said.""We do not deny it," put in Blake. "But we submit that the matter issusceptible to explanation.""You can keep your explanations till your trial, then," snappedAlbemarle. "I have heard more than enough to commit the pair of you togaol.""But, Your Grace," cried Sir Rowland, so fiercely that one of thetything-men set a restraining hand upon his shoulder, "I am ready toswear that what I did, and what my friend Mr. Westmacott did, was donein the interests of His Majesty. We were working to discover this plot.""Which, no doubt," put in Trenchard slyly, "is the reason why, havinggot the letter, your friend Mr. Westmacott locked it in a desk, and youkept silence on the matter.""You see," exclaimed Albemarle, "how your lies do but serve further tobind you in the toils. It is ever thus with traitors.""I do think you are a damned traitor, Trenchard," began Blake; "afoul..."But what more he would have said was checked by Albemarle, who thunderedforth an order for their removal, and then, scarce were the wordsuttered than the door at the far end of the hall was opened, and throughit came a sound of women's voices. Richard started, for one was thevoice of Ruth.An usher advanced. "May it please Your Grace, there are two ladies herebeg that you will hear their evidence in the matter of Mr. Westmacottand Sir Rowland Blake."Albemarle considered a moment. Trenchard stood very thoughtful."Indeed," said the Duke, at last, "I have heard as much as I need hear,"and Sir Phelips nodded in token of concurrence.Not so, however, Colonel Luttrell. "Still," said he, "in the interestsof His Majesty, perhaps, we should be doing well to receive them."Albemarle blew out his cheeks like a man wearied, and stared an instantat Luttrell. Then he shrugged his shoulders."Admit them, then," he commanded almost peevishly, and Ruth and Dianawere ushered into the hall. Both were pale, but whilst Diana wasfluttered with excitement, Ruth was calm and cool, and it was she whospoke in answer to the Duke's invitation. The burden of her speech wasa clear, succinct recitation--in which she spared neither Wildingnor herself--of how the letter came to have remained in her hands andsilence to have been preserved regarding it. Albemarle heard her verypatiently."If what you say is true, mistress," said he, "and God forbid thatI should be so ungallant as to throw doubt upon a lady's word, itcertainly explains--although most strangely--how the letter was notbrought to us at once by your brother and his friend Sir Rowland. Youare prepared to swear that this letter was intended for Mr. Wilding?""I am prepared to swear it," she replied."This is very serious," said the Duke."Very serious," assented Sir Edward Phelips.Albemarle, a little flustered, turned to his colleagues. "What do yousay to this? Were it perhaps well to order Mr. Wilding's apprehension,and to have him brought hither?""It were to give yourselves useless trouble, gentlemen," said Trenchard,with so much assurance that it was plain Albemarle hesitated."Beware of Mr. Trenchard, Your Grace," cried Ruth. "He is Mr. Wilding'sfriend, and if there is a plot he is sure to be in it."Albemarle, startled, looked at Trenchard. Had the accusation come fromeither of the men the Duke would have silenced him and abused him;but coming from a woman, and so comely a woman, it seemed to His Graceworthy at least of consideration. But nimble Mr. Trenchard was easilymaster of the situation."Which, of course," he answered, with fine sarcasm, "is the reason whyI have been at work for the past four-and-twenty hours to lay proofs ofthis plot before Your Grace."Albemarle was ashamed of his momentary hesitation."For the rest," said Trenchard, "it is perfectly true that I am Mr.Wilding's friend. But the lady is even more intimately connected withhim. It happens that she is his wife.""His... his wife!" gasped the Duke, whilst Phelips chuckled, and ColonelLuttrell's face grew dark.Trenchard's wicked smile flickered upon his mobile features. "There arerumours current of court paid her by Sir Rowland, there. Who knows?" hequestioned most suggestively, arching his brows and tightening his lips."Wives are strange kittle-kattle, and husbands have been known before togrow inconvenient. Upon reflection, Your Grace will no doubt discern theprecise degree of faith to attach to what this lady may tell you againstMr. Wilding.""Oh!" exclaimed Ruth, her cheeks flaming crimson. "But this ismonstrous!""Tis how I should myself describe it," answered Trenchard without shame.Spurred to it thus, Ruth poured out the entire story of her marriage,and so clear and lucid was her statement that it threw upon the affair aflood of light, whilst so frank and truthful was her tone, her narrativehung so well together, that the Bench began to recover from the shock toits faith, and was again in danger of believing her. Trenchard saw thisand trembled. To save Wilding for the Cause he had resorted to thisdesperate expedient of betraying that Cause. It must be observed,however, that he had not done so save under the conviction that betrayedit was bound to be, and that since that was inevitable the thing hadbetter come from him--for Wilding's sake--than from Richard Westmacott.He had taken the bull by the horns in a most desperate fashion when hehad determined to hoist Richard and Blake with their own petard, hopingthat, after all, the harm would reach no further than the destruction ofthese two--a purely defensive measure. But now this girl threatenedto wreck his scheme just as it was being safely steered to harbour.Suddenly he swung round, interrupting her."Lies, lies, lies!" he clamoured, and his interruption coming at such atime served to impress the Duke most unfavourably--as well it might."It is our wish to hear this lady out, Mr. Trenchard," the Duke reprovedhim.But Mr. Trenchard was undismayed. Indeed, he had just discovered ahitherto neglected card, which should put an end to this dangerous game."I do abhor to hear Your Grace's patience thus abused," he exclaimedwith some show of heat. "This lady makes a mock of you. If you'll allowme to ask two questions--or perhaps three--I'll promise finally to prickthis bubble for you. Have I Your Grace's leave?""Well, well," said Albemarle. "Let us hear your questions." And hiscolleagues nodded.Trenchard turned airily to Ruth. Behind her Diana sat--an attendant hadfetched a chair for her--in fear and wonder at what she saw and heard,her eyes ever and anon straying to Sir Rowland's back, which was towardsher."This letter, madam," said he, "for the possession of which you haveaccounted in so... so... picturesque a manner, was intended for andaddressed to Mr. Wilding, you say. And you are prepared to swear to it?"Ruth turned indignantly to the Bench. "Must I answer this man'squestions?" she demanded."I think, perhaps, it were best you did," said the Duke, still showingher all deference.She turned to Trenchard, her head high, her eyes full upon his wrinkled,cynical face. "I swear, then..." she began, but he--consummate actorthat he was and versed in tricks that impress an audience--interruptedher, raising one of his gnarled, yellow hands."Nay, nay," said he. "I would not have perjury proved against you. I donot ask you to swear. It will be sufficient if you pronounce yourselfprepared to swear."She pouted her lip a trifle, her whole expression manifesting hercontempt of him. "I am in no fear of perjuring myself," she answeredfearlessly. "And I swear that the letter in question was addressed toMr. Wilding.""As you will," said Trenchard, and was careful not to ask her how shecame by her knowledge. "The letter, no doubt, was in an outer wrapper,on which there would be a superscription--the name of the person to whomthe letter was addressed?" he half questioned, and Luttrell, who saw thedrift of the question, nodded gravely."No doubt," said Ruth."Now you will acknowledge, I am sure, madam, that such a wrapper wouldbe a document of the greatest importance, as important, indeed, as theletter itself, since we could depend upon it finally to clear up thispoint on which we differ. You will admit so much, I think?""Why, yes," she answered, but her voice faltered a little, and herglance was not quite so fearless. She, too, saw at last the pit he haddug for her. He leaned forward, smiling quietly, his voice impressivelysubdued, and launched the bolt that was to annihilate the credibility ofthe story she had told."Can you, then, explain how it comes that that wrapper has beensuppressed? Can you tell us how--the matter being as you state it--invery self-defence against the dangers of keeping such a letter, yourbrother did not also keep that wrapper?"Her eyes fell away from his face, they turned to Albemarle, who satscowling again, and from him they flickered unsteadily to Phelips andLuttrell, and lastly, to Richard, who, very white and with set teeth,stood listening to the working of his ruin."I... I do not know," she faltered at last."Ah!" said Trenchard, drawing a deep breath. He turned to the Bench."Need I suggest what was the need--the urgent need--for suppressing thatwrapper?" quoth he. "Need I say what name was inscribed upon it? I thinknot. Your Grace's keen insight, and yours, gentlemen, will determinewhat was probable."Sir Rowland now stood forward, addressing Albemarle. "Will Your Gracepermit me to offer my explanation of this?"Albemarle banged the table. His patience was at an end, since he camenow to believe--as Trenchard had earlier suggested--that he had beenplayed upon by Ruth."Too many explanations have I heard already, sir," he answered. Heturned to one of his secretaries. In his sudden excess of choler heforgot his colleagues altogether. "The prisoners are committed fortrial," said he harshly, and Trenchard breathed freely at last. But thenext instant he caught his breath again, for a ringing voice was heardwithout demanding to see His Grace of Albemarle at once, and the voicewas the voice of Anthony Wilding.CHAPTER XI. THE MARPLOTMr. Wilding's appearance produced as many different emotions as therewere individuals present. He made the company a sweeping bow on hisadmission by Albemarle's orders, a bow which was returned by a starefrom one and all. Diana eyed him in amazement, Ruth in hope; Richardaverted his glance from that of his brother-in-law, whilst Sir Rowlandmet it with a scowl of enmity--they had not come face to face since theoccasion of that encounter in which Sir Rowland's self-love had been sorudely handled. Albemarle's face expressed a sort of satisfaction,which was reflected on the countenances of Phelips and Luttrell; whilstTrenchard never thought of attempting to dissemble his profound dismay.And this dismay was shared, though not in so deep a measure, by Wildinghimself. Trenchard's presence gave him pause; for he had been far,indeed, from dreaming that his friend had a hand in this affair. Atsight of him all was made clear to Mr. Wilding. At once he saw the rolewhich Trenchard had assumed on this occasion, saw to the bottom of themotives that had inspired him to take the bull by the horns and levelagainst Richard and Blake this accusation before they had leisure tolevel it against himself.His quick wits having fathomed Trenchard's motive, Mr. Wilding wasdeeply touched by this proof of friendship, and for a second, as deeplynonplussed, at loss now how to discharge the task on which he came."You are very choicely come, Mr. Wilding," said Albemarle. "You will beable to resolve me certain doubts which have been set on foot by thesetraitors.""That," said Mr. Wilding, "is the purpose for which I am here. Newsreached me of the arrest that had been made. May I beg that Your Gracewill place me in possession of the facts that have so far transpired."It was one of his secretaries who, at Albemarle's bidding, gave Wildingthe information that he craved. He listened gravely; then, beforeAlbemarle had time to question him on the score of the name that mighthave been upon the enfolding wrapper of the letter, he begged that hemight confer apart a moment with Mr. Trenchard."But Mr. Wilding," said Colonel Luttrell, surprised not to hear theimmediate denial of the imputation they had expected, "we should firstlike to hear...""By your leave, sirs," Wilding interrupted, "I should prefer thatyou ask me nothing until I have consulted with Mr. Trenchard." He sawLuttrell's frown, observed Sir Edward shift his wig to scratch his headin sheer perplexity, and caught the fore-shadowing of denial on theDuke's face. So, without giving any of them time to say him nay, headded quickly and very seriously, "I am begging this in the interests ofjustice. Your Grace has told me that some lingering doubt still hauntsyour mind upon the subject of this letter--the other charges can matterlittle, apart from that treasonable document. It lies within my power toresolve such doubts most clearly and finally. But I warn you, sirs, thatnot one word will I utter in this connection until I have had speechwith Mr. Trenchard."There was about his mien and voice a firmness that forewarned Albemarlethat to insist would be worse than idle. A slight pause followed hiswords, and Luttrell leaned across to whisper in His Grace's ear; fromthe Duke's other side Sir Edward bent his head forward till it almosttouched those of his companions. Blake watched, and was most foolishlyimpatient."Your Grace will never allow this!" he cried."Eh?" said Albemarle, scowling at him."If you allow those two villains to consort together we are all undone,"the baronet protested, and ruined what chance there was of Albemarle'snot consenting.It was the one thing needed to determine Albemarle. Like the stubbornman he was, there was naught he detested so much as to have his coursedictated to him. More than that, in Sir Rowland's anxiety that Wildingand Trenchard should not be allowed to confer apart, he smoked a fearon Sir Rowland's part, based upon the baronet's consciousness of his ownguilt. He turned from him with a sneering smile, and without so muchas consulting his associates he glanced at Wilding and waved his handtowards the door."Pray do as you suggest, Mr. Wilding," said he. "But I depend upon younot to tax our patience.""I shall not keep Mr. Trenchard a moment longer than is necessary," saidWilding, giving no hint of the second meaning in his words.He stepped to the door, opened it himself, and signed to Trenchard topass out. The old player obeyed him readily, if in silence. An usherclosed the door after them, and in silence they walked together to theend of the passage."Where is your horse, Nick?" quoth Wilding abruptly."What a plague do you mean, where is my horse?" flashed Trenchard. "Whatmidsummer frenzy is this? Damn you for a marplot, Anthony! What a poxare you thinking of to thrust yourself in here at such a time?""I had no knowledge you were in the affair," said Wilding. "You shouldhave told me." His manner was brisk to the point of dryness. "However,there is still time to get you out of it. Where is your horse?""Damn my horse!" answered Trenchard in a passion. "You have spoiledeverything!""On the contrary," said Mr. Wilding tartly, "it seems you had done thatvery thoroughly before I arrived. Whilst I am touched by the regard forme which has misled you into turning the tables on Blake and Westmacott,yet I do blame you for this betrayal of the Cause.""There was no help for it.""Why, no; and that is why you should have left matters where theystood."Trenchard stamped his foot; indeed, he almost danced in the excess ofhis vexation. "Left them where they stood!" he echoed. "Body o' me!Where are your wits? Left them where they stood! And at any moment youmight have been taken unawares as a consequence of this accusation beinglodged against you by Richard or by Blake. Then the Cause would havebeen betrayed, indeed.""Not more so than it is now.""Not less, at least," snapped the player. "You give me credit for nomore wit than yourself. Do you think that I am the man to do things byhalves? I have betrayed the plot to Albemarle; but do you imagine I havemade no provision for what must follow?""Provision?" echoed Wilding, staring."Aye, provision. God lack! What do you suppose Albemarle will do?""Dispatch a messenger to Whitehall with the letter within an hour.""You perceive it, do you? And where the plague do you think NickTrenchard'll be what time that messenger rides?"Mr. Wilding understood. "Aye, you may stare," sneered Trenchard. "Aletter that has once been stolen may be stolen again. The courier mustgo by way of Walford. I had in my mind arranged the spot, close by theford, where I should fall upon him, rob him of his dispatches, and takehim--bound hand and foot if necessary--to Vallancey's, who lives closeby; and there I'd leave him until word came that the Duke had landed.""That the Duke had landed?" cried Wilding. "You talk as though the thingwere imminent.""And imminent it is. For aught we know he may be in England already."Mr. Wilding laughed impatiently. "You must forever be building on thesecrack-brained rumours, Nick," said he."Rumours!" roared the other. "Rumours? Ha!" He checked his wild scorn,and proceeded in a different key. "I was forgetting. You do not know theContents of that stolen letter."Wilding started. Underlying his disbelief in the talk of thecountryside, and even in the military measures which by the King'sorders were being taken in the West, was an uneasy dread lest theyshould prove to be well founded, lest Argyle's operations in Scotlandshould be but the forerunner of a rash and premature invasion byMonmouth. He knew the Duke was surrounded by such reckless, foolhardycounsellors as Grey and Ferguson--and yet he could not think the Dukewould ruin all by coming before he had definite word that his friendswere ready. He looked at Trenchard now with anxious eyes."Have you seen the letter, Nick?" he asked, and almost dreaded thereply."Albemarle showed it me an hour ago," said Trenchard."And it contains?""The news we fear. It is in the Duke's own hand, and intimates that hewill follow it in a few days--in a few days, man in person."Mr. Wilding clenched teeth and hands. "God help us all, then!" hemuttered grimly."Meanwhile," quoth Trenchard, bringing him back to the point, "there isthis precious business here. I had as choice a plan as could have beendevised, and it must have succeeded, had you not come blundering into itto mar it all at the last moment. That fat fool Albemarle had swallowedmy impeachment like a draught of muscadine. Do you hear me?" he endedsharply, for Mr. Wilding stood bemused, his thoughts plainly wandering.He let his hand fall upon Trenchard's shoulder. "No," said he, "I wasn'tlistening. No matter; for even had I known the full extent of yourscheme I still must have interfered.""For the sake of Mistress Westmacott's blue eyes, no doubt," sneeredTrenchard. "Pah! Wherever there's a woman there's the loss of a man.""For the sake of Mistress Wilding's blue eyes," his friend correctedhim. "I'll allow no brother of hers to hang in my place.""It will be interesting to see how you will rescue him.""By telling the truth to Albemarle.""He'll not believe it.""I shall prove it," said Wilding quietly. Trenchard swung round upon himin mingled anger and alarm for him. "You shall not do it!" he snarled."It is nothing short of treason to the Duke to get yourself laid by theheels at such a time as this.""I hope to avoid it," answered Wilding confidently."Avoid it? How?""Not by staying longer here in talk. That will ruin all. Away with you,Trenchard!""By my soul, no!" answered Trenchard. "I'll not leave you. If I have gotyou into this, I'll help to get you out again, or stay in it with you.""Bethink you of Monmouth?" Wilding admonished him."Damn Monmouth!" was the vicious answer. "I am here, and here I stay.""Get to horse, you fool, and ride to Walford as you proposed, there toambush the messenger. The letter will go to Whitehall none the less inspite of what I shall tell Albemarle. If things go well with me, I shalljoin you at Vallancey's before long.""Why, if that is your intention," said Trenchard, "I had better stay,and we can ride together. It will make it less uncertain for you.""But less certain for you.""The more reason why I should remain."The door of the hall was suddenly flung open at the far end of thecorridor, and Albemarle's booming voice, impatiently raised, reachedthem where they stood."In any case," added Trenchard, "it seems there is no help for it now."Mr. Wilding shrugged his shoulders, but otherwise dissembled hisvexation. Up the passage floated the constable's voice calling them.Side by side they moved down, and side by side they stepped once moreinto the presence of Christopher Monk and his associates."Sirs, you have not been in haste," was the Duke's ill-humouredgreeting."We have tarried a little that we might make an end the sooner,"answered Trenchard dryly, and this was the first indication he gave Mr.Wilding of how naturally--like the inimitable actor that he was--he hadslipped into his new role.Albemarle waved the frivolous rejoinder aside. "Come, Mr. Wilding," saidhe, "let us hear what you may have to say. You are not, I take it, aboutto urge any reasons why these rogues should not be committed?""Indeed, Your Grace," said Wilding, "that is what I am about to urge."Blake and Richard looked at him suddenly, and from him to Trenchard; butit was only Ruth whose eyes were shrewd enough to observe the altereddemeanour of the latter. Her hopes rose, founded upon this oddlyassorted pair. Already in anticipation she was stirred by gratitudetowards Wilding, and it was in impatient and almost wondering awe thatshe waited for him to proceed."I take it, sir," he said, without waiting for Albemarle to expressany of the fresh astonishment his countenance manifested, "that theaccusation against these gentlemen rests entirely upon the letter whichyou have been led to believe was addressed to Mr. Westmacott."The Duke scowled a moment before replying. "Why," said he, "if it couldbe shown--irrefutably shown--that the letter was not addressed to eitherof them, that would no doubt establish the truth of what they say--thatthey possessed themselves of the letter in the interests of HisMajesty." He turned to Luttrell and Phelips, and they nodded theirconcurrence with his view of the matter. "But," he continued, "ifyou are proposing to prove any such thing, I think you will find itdifficult."Mr. Wilding drew a crumpled paper from his pocket. "When the courierwhom they robbed, as they have correctly informed you," said he quietly,"suspected their design upon the contents of his wallet, he bethoughthim of removing the wrapper from the letter, so that in case theletter were seized by them it should prove nothing against any manin particular. He stuffed the wrapper into the lining of his hat,preserving it as a proof of his good faith against the time when heshould bring the letter to its destination, or come to confess that ithad been taken from him. That wrapper the courier brought to me, and Ihave it here. The evidence it will give should be more than sufficientto warrant your restoring these unjustly accused gentlemen theirliberty.""The courier took it to you?" echoed Albemarle, stupefaction in hisglance. "But why to you?""Because," said Wilding, and with his left hand he placed the wrapperbefore Albemarle, whilst his right dropped again to his pocket, "theletter, as you may see, was addressed to me."The quiet manner in which he made the announcement conveyed almost asgreat a shock as the announcement itself.Albemarle took up the wrapper; Luttrell and Phelips craned forward tojoin him in his scrutiny of it. They compared the two, paper with paper,writing with writing. Then Monk flung one and the other down in front ofhim."What lies have I been hearing, then?" he demanded furiously ofTrenchard. "'Slife I'll make an example of you. Arrest me thatrogue--arrest them both," and he half rose from his seat, his tremblinghand pointing to Wilding and Trenchard.Two of the tything-men stirred to do his bidding, but in the sameinstant Albemarle found himself looking into the round nozzle of apistol."If," said Mr. Wilding, "a finger is laid upon Mr. Trenchard or me Ishall have the extreme mortification of being compelled to shoot YourGrace."His pleasantly modulated voice was as deliberate and calm as if he wereoffering the Bench a pinch of snuff. Albemarle's dark visage crimsoned;his eyes became at once wicked and afraid. Sir Edward's cheeks turnedpale, his glance grew startled. Luttrell alone, vigilant and dangerous,preserved his calm. But the situation baffled even him.Behind the two friends the tything-men had come to a terror-strickenhalt. Diana had risen from her chair in the excitement of the moment andhad drawn close to Ruth, who looked on with parted lips and bosomthat rose and fell. Even Blake could not stifle his admiration ofMr. Wilding's coolness and address. Richard, on the other hand, wasconcerned only with thoughts for himself, wondering how it would farewith him if Wilding and Trenchard succeeded in getting away."Nick," said Mr. Wilding, "will you desire those catchpolls behind usto stand aside? If Your Grace raises your voice to call for help, if,indeed, any measures are taken calculated to lead to our capture, Ican promise Your Grace--notwithstanding my profound reluctance to useviolence--that they will be the last measures you will take in life. Begood enough to open the door, Nick, and to see that the key is on theoutside."Trenchard, who was by way of enjoying himself now, stepped brisklydown the hall to do as his friend bade him, with a wary eye on thetything-men. But never so much as a finger did they dare to lift. Mr.Wilding's calm was too deadly; they had seen a man in earnest beforethis, and they knew his appearance now. From the doorway Trenchardcalled Mr. Wilding."I must be going, Your Grace," said the latter very courteously, "butI shall not be so wanting in deference to His Majesty's augustrepresentatives as to turn my back upon you." Saying which, he walkedbackwards, holding his pistol level, until he had reached Trenchard andthe door. There he paused and made them a deep bow, his manner the moremocking in that there was no tinge of mockery perceptible. "Your veryobedient servant," said he, and stepped outside. Trenchard turned thekey, withdrew it from the lock, and, standing on tiptoe, thrust it uponthe ledge of the lintel.Instantly a clamour arose within the chamber. But the two friends neverstayed to listen. Down the passage they sped at the double, and outinto the courtyard. Here Ruth's groom, mounted himself, was walking hismistress's and Diana's horses up and down whilst he waited; yonder oneof Sir Edward's stable-boys was holding Mr. Wilding's roan. Two or threemen of the Somerset militia, in their red and yellow liveries, loungedby the gates, and turned uninterested eyes upon these newcomers.Wilding approached his wife's groom. "Get down," he said, "I need yourhorse--on the King's business. Get down, I say," he added impatiently,upon noting the fellow's stare, and, seizing his leg, he helped him todismount by almost dragging him from the saddle. "Up with you, Nick,"said he, and Nick very promptly mounted. "Your mistress will be herepresently," Wilding told the groom, and, turning on his heel, strodeto his own mare. A moment later Trenchard and he vanished through thegateway with a tremendous clatter, just as the Lord-Lieutenant, ColonelLuttrell, Sir Edward Phelips, the constable, the tything-men, SirRowland, Richard, and the ladies made their appearance.Ruth pushed her way quickly to the front. She feared lest her horseand her cousin's being at hand might be used for the pursuit; so urgingDiana to do the same, she snatched her reins from the hands of thedumbfounded groom and leapt nimbly to the saddle."After them!" roared Albemarle, and the constable with two of hismen made a dash for the gateway to raise the hue and cry, whilstthe militiamen watched them in stupid, inactive wonder. "Damnation,mistress!" thundered the Duke in ever-increasing passion, "hold yournag! Hold your nag, woman!" For Ruth's horse had become unmanageable,and was caracoling about the yard between the men and the gateway insuch a manner that they dared not attempt to win past her."You have scared him with your bellowing," she panted, tugging at thebridle, and all but backed into the constable who had been endeavouringto get round behind her. The beast continued its wild prancing, and theDuke abated nothing in his furious profanity, until suddenly the groom,having relinquished to Diana the reins of the other horse, sprang toRuth's assistance and caught her bridle in a firm grasp which broughtthe animal to a standstill."You fool!" she hissed at him, and half raised her whip to strike, butchecked on the impulse, bethinking her in time that, after all, what thepoor lad had done he had done thinking her distressed.The constable and a couple of his fellows won through; others wererousing the stable and getting to horse, and in the courtyard all wasbustle and commotion. Meanwhile, however, Mr. Wilding and Trenchard hadmade the most of their start, and were thundering through the town.CHAPTER XII. AT THE FORDAs Mr. Wilding and Nick Trenchard rode hell-to-leather through Tauntonstreets they never noticed a horseman at the door of the Red Lion Inn.But the horseman noticed them. He looked up at the sound of their wildapproach, started upon recognizing them, and turned in his saddle asthey swept past him to call upon them excitedly to stop."Hi!" he shouted. "Nick Trenchard! Hi! Wilding!" Then, seeing that theyeither did not hear or did not heed him, he loosed a volley of oaths,wheeled his horse about, drove home the spurs, and started in pursuit.Out of the town he followed them and along the road towards Walford,shouting and clamouring at first, afterwards in a grim and angrysilence.Now, despite their natural anxiety for their own safety, Wilding andTrenchard had by no means abandoned their project of taking cover by theford to await the messenger whom Albemarle and the others would nodoubt be sending to Whitehall; and this mad fellow thundering after themseemed in a fair way to mar their plan. As they reluctantly passed thespot they had marked out for their ambush, splashed through the ford andbreasted the rising ground beyond, they took counsel. They determinedto stand and meet this rash pursuer. Trenchard calmly opined that ifnecessary they must shoot him; he was, I fear, a bloody-minded fellowat bottom, although, it is true he justified himself now by pointing outthat this was no time to hesitate at trifles. Partly because theytalked and partly because the gradient was steep and their horsesneeded breathing, they slackened rein, and the horseman behind themcame tearing through the water of the ford and lessened the distanceconsiderably in the next few minutes.He bethought him of using his lungs once more. "Hi, Wilding! Hold, damnyou!""He curses you in a most intimate manner," quoth Trenchard.Wilding reined in and turned in the saddle. "His voice has a familiarsound," said he. He shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked down theslope at the pursuer, who came on crouching low upon the withers of hisgoaded beast."Wait!" the fellow shouted. "I have news--news for you!""It's Vallancey!" cried Wilding suddenly. Trenchard too had drawnrein and was looking behind him. Instead of expressing relief at thediscovery that this was not an enemy, he swore at the trouble towhich they had so needlessly put themselves, and he was still at hisvituperations when Vallancey came up with them, red in the face and veryangry, cursing them roundly for the folly of their mad career, and fornot having stopped when he bade them."It was no doubt discourteous," said Mr. Wilding "but we took you forsome friend of the Lord-Lieutenant's.""Are they after you?" quoth Vallancey, his face of a sudden verystartled."Like enough," said Trenchard, "if they have found their horses yet.""Forward, then," Vallancey urged them in excitement, and he picked uphis reins again. "You shall hear my news as we ride.""Not so," said Trenchard. "We have business here down yonder at theford.""Business? What business?"They told him, and scarce had they got the words out than he cut inimpatiently. "That's no matter now."Not yet, perhaps," said Mr. Wilding; "but it will be if that lettergets to Whitehall.""Odso!" was the impatient retort, "there's other news travelling toWhitehall that will make small-beer of this--and belike it's well on itsway there already.""What news is that?" asked Trenchard. Vallancey told them. "The Duke haslanded--he came ashore this morning at Lyme.""The Duke?" quoth Mr. Wilding, whilst Trenchard merely stared. "WhatDuke?""What Duke! Lord, you weary me! What dukes be there? The Duke ofMonmouth, man.""Monmouth!" They uttered the name in a breath. "But is this reallytrue?" asked Wilding. "Or is it but another rumour?""Remember the letter your friends intercepted," Trenchard bade him."I am not forgetting it," said Wilding."It's no rumour," Vallancey assured them. "I was at White Lackingtonthree hours ago when the news came to George Speke, and I was riding tocarry it to you, going by way of Taunton that I might drop word of itfor our friends at the Red Lion."Trenchard needed no further convincing; he looked accordingly dismayed.But Wilding found it still almost impossible--in spite of what alreadyhe had learnt--to credit this amazing news. It was hard to believe theDuke of Monmouth mad enough to spoil all by this sudden and unheraldedprecipitation."You heard the news at White Lackington?" said he slowly. "Who carriedit thither?""There were two messengers," answered Vallancey, with restrainedimpatience, "and they were Heywood Dare--who has been appointedpaymaster to the Duke's forces--and Mr. Chamberlain."Mr. Wilding was observed for once to change colour. He gripped Vallanceyby the wrist. "You saw them?" he demanded, and his voice had a husky,unusual sound. "You saw them?""With these two eyes," answered Vallancey, "and I spoke with them."It was true, then! There was no room for further doubt.Wilding looked at Trenchard, who shrugged his shoulders and made a wryface. "I never thought but that we were working in the service of ahairbrain," said he contemptuously.Vallancey proceeded to details. "Dare and Chamberlain," he informedthem, "came off the Duke's own frigate at daybreak to-day. They were putashore at Seatown, and they rode straight to Mr. Speke's with the news,returning afterwards to Lyme.""What men has the Duke with him, did you learn?" asked Wilding."Not more than a hundred or so, from what Dare told us.""A hundred! God help us all! And is England to be conquered with ahundred men? Oh, this is midsummer frenzy.""He counts on all true Protestants to flock to his banner," put inTrenchard, and it was not plain whether he expressed a fact or sneeredat one."Does he bring money and arms, at least?" asked Wilding."I did not ask," answered Vallancey. "But Dare told us that threevessels had come over, so that it is to be supposed he brings somemanner of provision with him.""It is to be hoped so, Vallancey; but hardly to be supposed," quothTrenchard, and then he touched Wilding on the arm and pointed with hiswhip across the fields towards Taunton. A cloud of dust was rising frombetween tall hedges where ran the road. "I think it were wise to bemoving. At least, this sudden landing of James Scott relieves my mind inthe matter of that letter."Wilding, having taken a look at the floating dust that announced theoncoming of their pursuers, was now lost in thought. Vallancey, who,beyond excitement at the news of which he was the bearer, seemed to haveno opinion of his own as to the wisdom or folly of the Duke's suddenarrival, looked from one to the other of these two men whom he had knownas the prime secret agents in the West, and waited. Trenchard moved hishorse a few paces nearer the hedge, "Whither now, Anthony?" he askedsuddenly."You may ask, indeed!" exclaimed Wilding, and his voice was as bitteras ever Trenchard had heard it. "'S heart! We are in it now! We hadbest make for Lyme--if only that we may attempt to persuade thiscrack-brained boy to ship back to Holland again, and ship ourselves withhim.""There's sense in you at last," grumbled Trenchard. "But I misdoubt mehe'll turn back after having come so far. Have you any money?" he asked.He could be very practical at times."A guinea or two. But I can get money at Ilminster.""And how do you propose to reach Ilminster with these gentlemen by wayof cutting us off?""We'll double back as far as the cross-roads," said Wilding promptly,"and strike south over Swell Hill for Hatch. If we ride hard we can doit easily, and have little fear of being followed. They'll naturallytake it we have made for Bridgwater."They acted on the suggestion there and then, Vallancey going with them;for his task was now accomplished, and he was all eager to get to Lymeto kiss the hand of the Protestant Duke. They rode hard, as Wilding hadsaid they must, and they reached the junction of the roads before theirpursuers hove in sight. Here Wilding suddenly detained them again. Theroad ahead of them ran straight for almost a mile, so that if they tookit now they were almost sure to be seen presently by the messengers.On their right a thickly grown coppice stretched from the road to thestream that babbled in the hollow. He gave it as his advice that theyshould lie hidden there until those who hunted them should have gone by.Obviously that was the only plan, and his companions instantly adoptedit. They found a way through a gate into an adjacent field, and fromthis they gained the shelter of the trees. Trenchard, neglectful ofhis finery and oblivious of the ubiquitous brambles, left his horse inVallancey's care and crept to the edge of the thicket that he might takea peep at the pursuers.They came up very soon, six militiamen in lobster coats with yellowfacings, and a sergeant, which was what Mr. Trenchard might haveexpected. There was, however, something else that Mr. Trenchard did notexpect; something that afforded him considerable surprise. At the headof the party rode Sir Rowland Blake--obviously leading it--and with himwas Richard Westmacott. Amongst them went a man in grey clothes,whom Mr. Trenchard rightly conjectured to be the messenger riding forWhitehall. He thought with a smile of what a handful he andWilding would have had had they waited to rob that messenger of theincriminating letter that he bore. Then he checked his smile to consideragain how Sir Rowland Blake came to head that party. He abandoned theproblem, as the little troop swept unhesitatingly round to the left andwent pounding along the road that led northwards to Bridgwater, clearlynever doubting which way their quarry had sped.As for Sir Rowland Blake's connection with this pursuit, the towngallant had by his earnestness not only convinced Colonel Luttrell ofhis loyalty and devotion to King James, but had actually gone so far asto beg that he might be allowed to prove that same loyalty by leadingthe soldiers to the capture of those self-confessed traitors, Mr.Wilding and Mr. Trenchard. From his knowledge of their haunts he wasconfident, he assured Colonel Luttrell, that he could be of serviceto the King in this matter. The fierce sincerity of his purpose shonethrough his words; Luttrell caught the accent of hate in Sir Rowland'stense voice, and, being a shrewd man, he saw that if Mr. Wilding was tobe taken, an enemy would surely be the best pursuer to accomplish it. Sohe prevailed, and gave him the trust he sought, in spite of Albemarle'sexpressed reluctance. And never did bloodhound set out more relentlesslypurposeful upon a scent than did Sir Rowland follow now in what hebelieved to be the track of this man who stood between him and RuthWestmacott. Until Ruth was widowed, Sir Rowland's hopes of her must liefallow; and so it was with a zest that he flung himself into the task ofwidowing her.As the party passed out of view round the angle of the white road,Trenchard made his way back to Wilding to tell him what he had seen andto lay before him, for his enucleation, the problem of Blake's being theleader of it. But Wilding thought little of Blake, and cared little ofwhat he might be the leader."We'll stay here," said he, "until they have passed the crest of thehill."This, Trenchard told him, was his own purpose; for to leave theirconcealment earlier would be to reveal themselves to any of the trooperswho might happen to glance over his shoulder.And so they waited some ten minutes or so, and then walked their horsesslowly and carefully forward through the trees towards the road. Wildingwas alongside and slightly ahead of Trenchard; Vallancey followed closeupon their tails. Suddenly, as Wilding was about to put his mare at thelow stone wall, Trenchard leaned forward and caught his bridle."Ss!" he hissed. "Horses!"And now that they halted they heard the hoofbeats clear and close athand; the crackling of undergrowth and the rustle of the leaves throughwhich they had thrust their passage had deafened their ears to othersounds until this moment. They checked and waited where they stood,barely screened by the few boughs that still might intervene betweenthem and the open, not daring to advance, and not daring to retreatlest their movements should draw attention to themselves. They remainedabsolutely still, scarcely breathing, their only hope being that ifthese who came should chance to be enemies they might ride on withoutlooking to right or left. It was so slender a hope that Wilding lookedto the priming of his pistols, whilst Trenchard, who had none, loosenedhis sword in its scabbard. Nearer came the riders."There are not more than three," whispered Trenchard, who had beenlistening intently, and Mr. Wilding nodded, but said nothing.Another moment and the little party was abreast of those watchers; adark brown riding-habit flashed into their line of vision, and ablue one laced with gold. At sight of the first Mr. Wilding's eyelidsflickered; he had recognized it for Ruth's, with whom rode Diana,whilst some twenty paces or so behind came Jerry, the groom. They werereturning to Bridgwater.They came along, looking neither to right nor to left, as the three menhad hoped they would, and they were all but past, when suddenly Wildinggave his roan a touch of the spur and bounded forward. Diana's horseswerved so that it nearly threw her. Ruth, slightly ahead, reined in atonce; so, too, did the groom in the rear, and so violently in his suddenfear of highwaymen that he brought his horse on to its hind legs and hadit prancing and rearing madly about the road, so that he was hard put toit to keep his seat.Ruth looked round as Mr. Wilding's voice greeted her."Mistress Wilding," he called to her. "A moment, if I may detain you.""You have eluded them!" she cried, entirely off her guard in hersurprise at seeing him, and there echoed through her words a note ofgenuine gladness that almost disconcerted her husband for a moment. Thenext instant a crimson flush overspread her pale face, and her eyes wereveiled from him, vexation in her heart at having betrayed the livelysatisfaction it afforded her to see him safe when she feared himcaptured already or at least upon the point of capture.She had admired him almost unconsciously for his daring at the town hallthat day, when his strong calm had stood out in such sharp contrast tothe fluster and excitement of the men about him; of them all, indeed, ithad seemed to her in those stressful moments that he was the only man,and she was--although she did not realize it--in danger of being proudof him. Then again the thing he had done. He had come deliberately tothrust his head into the lion's maw that he might save her brother. Itwas possible that he had done it in answer to the entreaties which shehad earlier feared she had poured into deaf ears; or it was possiblethat he had done it spurred by his sense of right and justice, whichwould not permit him to allow another to suffer in his stead--howevermuch that other might be caught in the very toils that he had preparedfor Mr. Wilding himself. Her admiration, then, was swelled by gratitude,and it was a compound of these that had urged her to hinder thetything-men from winning past her until he and Trenchard should have gotwell away.Afterwards, when with Diana and her groom--on a horse which Sir EdwardPhelips insisted upon lending them--she rode homeward from Taunton,there was Diana to keep alive the spark of kindness that glowed at lastfor Wilding in Ruth's breast. Miss Horton extolled his bravery, hischivalry, his nobility, and ended by expressing her envy of Ruth thatshe should have won such a man amongst men for her husband, and wonderedwhat it might be that kept Ruth from claiming him for her own as washer right. Ruth had answered little, but she had ridden very thoughtful;there was that in the past she found it hard to forgive Wilding. And yetshe would now have welcomed an opportunity of thanking him for what hehad done, of expressing to him something of the respect he had wonin her eyes by his act of self-denunciation to save her brother. Thischance, it seemed, was given her, for there he stood, with head baredbefore her; and already she thought no longer of seizing the chance,vexed as she was at having been surprised into a betrayal of feelingswhose warmth she had until that moment scarce estimated.In answer to her cry of "You have eluded them!" he waved a hand towardsthe rising ground and the road to Bridgwater."They passed that way but a few moments since," said he, "and by therate at which they were travelling they should be nearing Newton by now.In their great haste to catch me they could not pause to look for me soclose at hand," he added with a smile, "and for that I am thankful."She sat her horse and answered nothing, which threw her cousin out ofall patience with her. "Come, Jerry," Diana called to the groom. "Wewill walk our horses up the hill.""You are very good, madam," said Mr. Wilding, and he bowed to thewithers of his roan.Ruth said nothing; expressed neither approval nor disapproval of Diana'swithdrawal, and the latter, with a word of greeting to Wilding, wentahead followed by Jerry, who had regained control by now of the beasthe bestrode. Wilding watched them until they turned the corner, then hewalked his mare slowly forward until he was alongside Ruth."Before I go," said he, "there is something I should like to say." Hisdark eyes were sombre, his manner betrayed some hesitation.The diffidence of his tone proved startling to her by virtue of itsunusualness. What might it portend, she wondered, and sought with graveeyes to read his baffling countenance; and then a wild alarm swept intoher and shook her spirit in its grip; there was something of which untilthis moment she had not thought--something connected with the fatefulmatter of that letter. It had stood as a barrier between them, herbuckler, her sole defence against him. It had been to her what itssting is to the bee--a thing which if once used in self-defence isself-destructive. Not, indeed, that she had used it as her sting; it hadbeen forced from her by the machinations of Trenchard; but used it hadbeen, and was done with; she had it no longer that with it she mighthold him in defiance, and it did not occur to her that he was no longerin case to invoke the law.Her face grew stony, a dry glitter came to her blue eyes; she cast aglance over her shoulder at Diana and her servant. Wilding observedit and read what was passing in her mind; indeed, it was not to bemistaken, no more than what is passing in the mind of the recruit wholooks behind him in the act of charging. His lips half smiled."Of what are you afraid?" he asked her."I am not afraid," she answered in husky accents that belied her.Perhaps to reassure her, perhaps because he thought of his companionslurking in the thicket and cared not to have them for his audience, hesuggested they should go a little way in the direction her cousin hadtaken. She wheeled her horse, and, side by side, they ambled up thedusty road."The thing I have to tell you," said he presently, "concerns myself.""Does it concern me?" she asked him coldly, and her coolness was urgedpartly by her newborn fears, partly to counterbalance such impressionas her illjudged show of gladness at his safety might have made upon hismind. He flashed her a sidelong glance, the long white fingers of hisright hand toying thoughtfully with a ringlet of the dark brown hairthat fell upon the shoulders of his scarlet coat."Surely, madam," he answered dryly, "what concerns a man may wellconcern his wife."She bowed her head, her eyes upon the road before her. "True," said she,her voice expressionless. "I had forgot."He reined in and turned to look at her; her horse moved on a pace ortwo, then came to a halt, apparently of its own accord."I do protest," said he, "you treat me less kindly than I deserve." Heurged his mare forward until he had come up with her again, andthen drew rein once more. "I think that I may lay some claim to--atleast--your gratitude for what I did to-day.""It is my inclination to be grateful," said she. She was very wary ofhim. "Forgive me, if I am still mistrustful.""But of what?" he cried, a thought impatiently."Of you. What ends did you seek to serve? Was it to save Richard thatyou came?""Unless you think that it was to save Blake," he said ironically. "Whatother ends do you conceive I could have served?" She made him no answer,and so he resumed after a pause. "I rode to Taunton to serve you for tworeasons; because you asked me, and because I would have no innocent mensuffer in my stead--not even though, as these men, they were but caughtin their own toils, hoist with the petard they had charged for me.Beyond these two motives, I had no other thought in ruining myself.""Ruining yourself?" she cried. Yes, it was true; but she had not thoughtof it until this moment; there had been so much to think of."Is it not ruin to be outlawed, to have a price set upon your head, aswill no doubt a price be set on mine when Albemarle's messenger shallhave reached Whitehall? Is it not ruin to have my lands and all Iown made forfeit to the State, to find myself a beggar, hunted andproscribed? Forgive me that I harass you with this catalogue of mymisfortunes. You'll say, no doubt, that I have brought them upon myselfby compelling you against your will to marry me."I'll not deny that it is in my mind," said she, and of set purposestifled pity.He sighed and looked at her again, but she would not meet his eye, elseits whimsical expression might have intrigued her. "Can you deny mymagnanimity, I wonder?" said he, and spoke almost as one amused. "All Ihad I sacrificed to do your will, to save your brother from the snareof his own contriving against me. I wonder do you yet realize how muchI sacrificed to-day at Taunton! I wonder!" And he paused, looking at herand waiting for some word from her; but she had none for him."Clearly you do not, else I think you would show me if only a pretenceof kindness." She was looking at him at last, her eyes less hard. Theyseemed to ask him to explain. "When you came this morning with thetale of how the tables had been turned upon your brother, of how hewas caught in his own springe, and the letter found in his keeping wasbefore the King's folk at Taunton with every appearance of having beenaddressed to him, and not a tittle of evidence to show that it had beenmeant for me, do you know what news it was you brought me?" He pauseda second, looking at her from narrowing eyes. Then he answered his ownquestion. "You brought me the news that you were mine to take whensoe'erI pleased. Whilst that letter was in your hands it gave you the power tomake me your obedient slave. You might blow upon me as you listed whilstyou held it, and I was a vane that must turn to your blowing for myhonour's sake and for the sake of the cause in which I worked. Throughno rashness of mine must that letter come into the hands of the King'sfriends, else was I dishonoured. It was an effective barrier between us.So long as you possessed that letter you might pipe as you pleased, andI must dance to the tune you set. And then this morning what you came totell me was that things were changed; that it was mine to call the tune.Had I had the strength to be a villain, you had been mine now, andyour brother and Sir Rowland might have hanged on the rope of their ownweaving."She looked at him in a startled, almost shamefaced manner. This was anaspect of the case she had not considered."You realize it, I see," he said, and smiled wistfully. "Then perhapsyou realize why you found me so unwilling to do the thing you craved.Having treated me ungenerously, you came to cast yourself upon mygenerosity, asking me--though I scarcely think you understood--to beggarmyself of life itself with all it held for me. God knows I make nopretence to virtue, and yet I think I had been something more than humanhad I not refused you and the bargain you offered--a bargain that youwould never be called upon to fulfil if I did the thing you asked."At last she interrupted him; she could bear it no longer."I had not thought of it!" she cried. It was a piteous wail that brokefrom her. "I swear I had not thought of that. I was all distraught forpoor Richard's sake. Oh, Mr. Wilding," she turned to him, holding out ahand; her eyes shone, filmed with moisture, "I shall have a kindnessfor you... all my days for your... generosity to-day." It was lamentablyweak, far from the hot expressions which she forced it to replace."Yes, I was generous," he admitted. "We will move on as far as thecross-roads." Again they ambled gently forward. Up the slope from theford Diana and Jerry were slowly climbing; not another human being wasin sight ahead or behind them. "After you left me," he continued, "yourmemory and your entreaties lingered with me. I gave the matter of ourposition thought, and it seemed to me that all was monstrously ill-done.I loved you, Ruth, I needed you, and you disdained me. My love wasmaster of me. But 'neath your disdain it was transmuted oddly." Hechecked the passion that was vibrating in his voice and resumed aftera pause, in the calm, slow tones, soft and musical, that were his own."There is scarce the need for so much recapitulation. When the powerwas mine I bent you unfairly to my will; you did as much by me whenthe power suddenly became yours. It was a strange war between us, and Iaccepted its conditions. To-day, when the power was mine again, mineto bring you at last to subjection, behold, I have capitulated atyour bidding, and all that I held--including your own self--have Irelinquished. It is perhaps fitting. Haply I am punished for having wedyou before I had wooed you." Again his tone changed, it grew more cold,more matter-of-fact. "I rode this way a little while ago a hunted man,my only hope to reach home and collect what moneys and valuables I couldcarry, and make for the coast to find a vessel bound for Holland. Ihave been engaged, as you know, in stirring up rebellion to check theiniquities and persecutions that are toward in a land I love. I'll notweary you with details. Time was needed for this as for all things, andby next spring, perhaps, had matters gone well, this vineyard that socarefully and secretly I have been tending, would have been, maybe, incondition to bear fruit. Even now, in the hour of my flight, I learnthat others have come to force this delicate growth into suddenmaturity. There! Soon ripe, soon rotten. The Duke of Monmouth has landedat Lyme this morning. I am riding to him.""To what end?" she cried, and he saw in her face a dismay that amountedalmost to fear, and he wondered was it for him."To place my sword at his service. Were I not encompassed by thisruin, I should not have stirred a foot in that direction--so rash, soforedoomed to failure is this invasion. As it is,"--he shrugged andlaughed--"it is the only hope--all forlorn though it may be--for me."The trammels she had imposed upon her soul fell away at that like bondsof cobweb. She laid her hand upon his wrists, tears stood in her eyes;her lips quivered."Anthony, forgive me," she besought him. He trembled under her touch,under the caress of her voice, and at the sound of his name for thefirst time upon her lips."What have I to forgive?" he asked."The thing that I did in the matter of that letter.""You poor child," said he, smiling gently upon her, "you did it inself-defence.""Yet say that you forgive me--say it before you go!" she begged him.He considered her gravely a moment. "To what end," he asked, "do youimagine that I have talked so much? To the end that I might show youthat however I may have wronged you I have at the last made some amends;and that for the sake of this, the truest proof of penitence, I may haveyour forgiveness ere I go."She was weeping softly. "It was an ill day on which we met," she sighed."For you--aye.""Nay--for you."We'll say for both of us, then," he compromised. "See, Ruth, yourcousin grows weary, and I have a couple of comrades who are no doubtimpatient to be gone. It may not be good for us to tarry in these parts.Some amends I have made; but there is one crowning wrong which I havedone you for which there is but one amend to make." He paused. Hesteadied himself before continuing. In his attempt to render his voicecold and commonplace he went near to achieving harshness. "It may bethat this crackbrained rebellion of which the torch is already alightwill, if it does no other good in England, at least make a widow of you.When that has come to pass, when I have thus repaired the wrong Idid you, I hope you'll bear me as kindly as may be in your thought.Good-bye, my Ruth! I would you might have loved me. I sought to forceit." He smiled ever so wanly. "Perhaps that was my mistake. It is anill thing to eat one's hay while it is grass." He raised to his lips thelittle gloved hand that still rested on his wrist. "God keep you, Ruth!"he murmured.She sought to answer him, but something choked her; a sob was all sheachieved. Had he caught her to him in that moment there is little doubtbut that she had yielded. Perhaps he knew it; and knowing it kept thetighter rein upon desire. She was as metal molten in the crucible, to bemoulded by his craftsman's hands into any pattern that he chose. But thecrucible was the crucible of pity, not of love; that, too, he knew, and,knowing it, forbore.He dropped her hand, doffed his hat, and, wheeling his horse about,touched it with the spur and rode back towards the thicket where hisfriends awaited him. As he left her, she too wheeled about, as if tofollow him. She strove to command her voice that she might recall him;but at that same moment Trenchard, hearing his returning hoofs, thrustout into the road with Vallancey following at his heels. The oldplayer's harsh voice reached her where she stood, and it was querulouswith impatience."What a plague do you mean, dallying here at such a time, Anthony?" hecried, to which Vallancey added: "In God's name, let us push on."At that she checked her impulse--it may even be that she mistrusted it.She paused, lingering undecided for an instant; then, turning her horseonce more, she ambled up the slope to rejoin Diana.CHAPTER XIII. "PRO RELIGIONE ET LIBERTATE"The evening was far advanced when Mr. Wilding and his two companionsdescended to Uplyme Common from the heights whence as they rode they hadcommanded a clear view of the fair valley of the Axe, lying now under athin opalescent veil of evening mist.They had paused at Ilminster for fresh horses, and there Wilding hadpaid a visit to one of his agents from whom he had procured a hundredguineas. Thence they had come south at a sharp pace, and with littlesaid. Wilding was moody and thoughtful, filled with chagrin at thisunconscionable rashness of the man upon whom all his hopes were centred.As they cantered briskly across Uplyme Common in the twilight theypassed several bodies of countrymen, all heading for the town, and onegroup sent up a shout of "God save the Protestant Duke!" as they rodepast him."Amen to that," muttered Mr. Wilding grimly, "for I am afraid that noman can."In the narrow lane by Hay Farm a horseman, going in the oppositedirection, passed them at the gallop; but they had met several suchsince leaving Ilminster, for indeed the news was spreading fast, and thewhole countryside was alive with messengers, some on foot and some onhorseback, but all hurrying as if their lives depended on their haste.They made their way to the Market-Place where Monmouth'sdeclaration--that remarkable manifesto from the pen of Ferguson--hadbeen read some hours before. Thence, having ascertained where His Gracewas lodged, they made their way to the George Inn.In Coombe Street they found the crowd so dense that they could but withdifficulty open out a way for their horses through the human press.Not a window but was open, and thronged with sight-seers--mostly women,indeed, for the men were in the press below. On every hand resounded thecries of "A Monmouth! A Monmouth! The Protestant Religion! Religion andLiberty," which latter were the words inscribed on the standard Monmouthhad set up that evening on the Church Cliffs.In truth, Wilding was amazed at what he saw, and said as much toTrenchard. So pessimistic had been his outlook that he had almostexpected to find the rebellion snuffed out by the time they reachedLyme-of-the-King. What had the authorities been about that they hadpermitted Monmouth to come ashore, or had Vallancey's information beenwrong in the matter of the numbers that accompanied the ProtestantChampion? Wilding's red coat attracted some attention. In the dusk itscolour was almost all that could be discerned of it."Here's a militia captain for the Duke!" cried one, and others took upthe cry, and if it did nothing else it opened a way for them throughthat solid human mass and permitted them to win through to the yard ofthe George Inn. They found the spacious quadrangle thronged with men,armed and unarmed, and on the steps stood a tall, well-knit, soldierlyman, his hat rakishly cocked, about whom a crowd of townsmen andcountry fellows were pressing with insistence. At a glance Mr. Wildingrecognized Captain Venner--raised to the rank of colonel by Monmouth onthe way from Holland.Trenchard dismounted, and taking a distracted stable-boy by the arm,bade him see to their horses. The fellow endeavoured to swing himselffree of the other's tenacious grasp."Let me go," he cried. "I am for the Duke!""And so are we, my fine rebel," answered Trenchard, holding fast."Let me go," the lout insisted. "I am going to enlist.""And so you shall when you have stabled our nags. See to him, Vallancey;he is brainsick with the fumes of war."The fellow protested, but Trenchard's way was brisk and short; and so,protesting still, he led away their cattle in the end, Vallancey goingwith him to see that he performed this last duty as a stable-boy ere hetoo became a champion militant of the Protestant Cause. Trenchard spedafter Wilding, who was elbowing his way through the yokels about thesteps. The glare of a newly lighted lamp from the doorway fell full uponhis long white face as he advanced, and Venner espied and recognizedhim."Mr. Wilding!" he cried, and there was a glad ring in his voice,for though cobblers, tailors, deserters from the militia, pot-boys,stable-boys, and shuffling yokels had been coming in in numbers duringthe past few hours since the Declaration had been read, this was thefirst gentleman that arrived to welcome Monmouth. The soldier stretchedout a hand to grasp the newcomer's. "His Grace will see you thisinstant, not a doubt of it." He turned and called down the passage."Cragg!" A young man in a buff coat came forward, and to him Vennerdelivered Wilding and Trenchard that he might announce them to HisGrace.In the room that had been set apart for him abovestairs, Monmouth stillsat at table. He had just supped, with but an indifferent appetite,so fevered was he by the events of his landing. He was excited withhope--inspired by the readiness with which the men of Lyme and itsneighbourhood had flocked to his banner--and fretted by anxiety thatnone of the gentry of the vicinity should yet have followed the exampleof the meaner folk, in answer to the messages dispatched at dawn fromSeaton. The board at which he sat was still cumbered with some glassesand platters and vestiges of his repast. Below him on his right satFerguson--that prince of plotters--very busy with pen and ink, his keenface almost hidden by his great periwig; opposite were Lord Grey, ofWerke, and Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun, whilst, standing at the foot ofthe table barely within the circle of candlelight from the branch on thepolished oak, was Nathaniel Wade, the lawyer, who had fled to Hollandon account of his alleged complicity in the Rye House plot and was nowreturned a major in the Duke's service. Erect and soldierly of figure,girt with a great sword and with the butt of a pistol protruding fromhis belt, he had little the air of a man whose methods of contentionwere forensic."You understand, then, Major Wade," His Grace was saying, his voicepleasant and musical. "It is decided that the guns had best be gotashore forthwith and mounted."Wade bowed. "I shall set about it at once, Your Grace. I shall not wantfor help. Have I Your Grace's leave to go?"Monmouth nodded, and as Wade passed out, Ensign Cragg entered toannounce Mr. Wilding and Mr. Trenchard. The Duke rose to his feet, hisglance suddenly brightening. Fletcher and Grey rose with him; Fergusonpaid no heed, absorbed in his task, which he industriously continued."At last!" exclaimed the Duke. "Admit them, sir."When they entered, Wilding coming first, his hat under his arm, the Dukesprang to meet him, a tall young figure, lithe and slender as a blade ofsteel, and of a steely strength for all his slimness. He was dressed ina suit of purple that became him marvellously well, and on his breast astar of diamonds flashed and smouldered like a thing of fire. He wasof an exceeding beauty of face, wherein he mainly favoured that "bold,handsome woman" that was his mother, without, however, any of hismother's insipidity; fine eyes, a good nose, straight and slender, anda mouth which, if sensual and indicating a lack of strength, wasbeautifully shaped. His chin was slightly cleft, the shape of his facea delicate oval, framed now in the waving masses of his brown wig. Somelikeness to his late Majesty was also discernible, in spite of the wart,out of which his uncle James made so much capital.There was a slight flush on his cheeks, an added lustre in his eye, ashe took Wilding's hand and shook it heartily before Wilding had time tokiss His Grace's."You are late," he said, but there was no reproach in his voice. "We hadlooked to find you here when we came ashore. You had my letter?""I had not, Your Grace," answered Wilding, very grave. "It was stolen.""Stolen?" cried the Duke, and behind him Grey pressed forward, whilsteven Ferguson paused in his writing to raise his piercing eyes andlisten."It is no matter," Wilding reassured him. "Although stolen, it has butgone to Whitehall to-day, when it can add little to the news that isalready on its way there."The Duke laughed softly, with a flash of white teeth, and looked pastWilding at Trenchard. Some of the light faded out of his eyes. "Theytold me Mr. Trenchard..." he began, when Wilding, half turning to hisfriend, explained."This is Mr. Nicholas Trenchard--John Trenchard's cousin."I bid you welcome, sir," said the Duke, very agreeably, "and I trustyour cousin follows you.""Alas," said Trenchard, "my cousin is in France," and in a few briefwords he related the matter of John Trenchard's home-coming on hisacquittal and the trouble there had been connected with it.The Duke received the news in silence. He had expected good support fromold Speke's son-in-law. Indeed, there was a promise that when he came,John Trenchard would bring fifteen hundred men from Taunton. He took aturn in the room deep in thought, and there was a pause until Ferguson,rubbing his great Roman nose, asked suddenly had Mr. Wilding seen theDeclaration. Mr. Wilding had not, and thereupon the plotting parson, whowas proud of his composition, would have read it to him there and then,but that Grey sourly told him the matter would keep, and that they hadother things to discuss with Mr. Wilding.This the Duke himself confirmed, stating that there were matters onwhich he would be glad to have their opinion.He invited the newcomers to draw chairs to the table; glasses werecalled for, and a couple of fresh bottles of Canary went round theboard. The talk was desultory for a few moments, whilst Wilding andTrenchard washed the dust from their throats; then Monmouth broke theice by asking them bluntly what they thought of his coming thus, earlierthan was at first agreed.Wilding never hesitated in his reply. "Frankly, Your Grace," said he, "Ilike it not at all."Fletcher looked up sharply, his clear intelligent eyes full uponWilding's calm face, his countenance expressing as little as didWilding's. Ferguson seemed slightly taken aback. Grey's thick lips weretwisted in a sneering smile."Faith," said the latter with elaborate sarcasm, "in that case it onlyremains for us to ship again, heave anchor, and back to Holland.""It is what I should advise," said Wilding slowly and quietly, "if Ithought there was a chance of my advice being taken." He had a calm,almost apathetic way of uttering startling things which rendered themdoubly startling. The sneer seemed to freeze on Lord Grey's lips;Fletcher continued to stare, but his eyes had grown more round; Fergusonscowled darkly. The Duke's boyish face--it was still very youthfuldespite his six-and-thirty years--expressed a wondering consternation.He looked at Wilding, and from Wilding to the others, and his glanceseemed to entreat them to suggest an answer to him. It was Grey at lastwho took the matter up."You shall explain your meaning, sir, or we must hold you a traitor," heexclaimed."King James does that already," answered Wilding with a quiet smile."D'ye mean the Duke of York?" rumbled Ferguson's Scottish accent withstartling suddenness, and Monmouth nodded approval of the correction."If ye mean that bloody papist and fratricide, it were well so to speakof him. Had ye read the Declaration..."But Fletcher cropped his speech in mid-growth. He was ever ashort-tempered man, intolerant of irrelevancies."It were well, perhaps," said he, his accent abundantly proclaiming hima fellow countryman of Ferguson's, "to keep to the matter before us. Mr.Wilding, no doubt, will state the reasons that exist, or that he fanciesmay exist, for giving advice which is hardly worthy of the cause towhich he stands committed.""Aye, Fletcher," said Monmouth, "there is sense in you. Tell us what isin your mind, Mr. Wilding.""It is in my mind, Your Grace, that this invasion is rash, premature,and ill-advised.""Odds life!" cried Grey, and he swung angrily round fully to face theDuke, the nostrils of his heavy nose dilating. "Are we to listen to thismilksop prattle?"Nick Trenchard, who had hitherto been silent, cleared his throat sonoisily that he drew all eyes to himself."Your Grace," Mr. Wilding pursued, his air calm and dignified, andgathering more dignity from the circumstance that he proceeded as ifthere had been no interruption, "when I had the honour of conferringwith you at The Hague two months ago, it was agreed that you shouldspend the summer in Sweden--away from politics and scheming, leavingthe work of preparation to your accredited agents here. That work I havebeen slowly but surely pushing forward. It was not to be hurried; men ofposition are not to be won over in a day; men with anything to lose needsome guarantee that they are not wantonly casting their possessions tothe winds. By next spring, as was agreed, all would have been ready.Delay could not have hurt you. Indeed, with every day by which youdelayed your coming you did good service to your cause, you strengthenedits prospects of success; for every day the people's burden ofoppression and persecution grows more heavy, and the people's tempermore short; every day, by the methods that he is pursuing, King Jamesbrings himself into deeper hatred. This hatred is spreading. It wasthe business of myself and those others to help it on, until from thecottage of the ploughman the infection of anger should have spreadto the mansion of the squire. Had Your Grace but given me time, asI entreated you, and as you promised me, you might have marched toWhitehall with scarce the shedding of a drop of blood; had Your Gracebut waited until we were ready, England would have so trembled at yourlanding that your uncle's throne would have toppled over 'neath theshock. As it is..." He shrugged his shoulders, sighed and spread hishands, leaving his sentence uncompleted.Monmouth sat sobered by these sober words; the intoxication that hadcome to him from the little measure of success that had attended theopening of the listing on Church Cliffs, deserted him now; he saw thething stark and in its true proportions, and not even the shouting ofthe folk in the streets below, crying his name and acclaiming him theirchampion, served to lighten the gloom that Wilding's words cast likea cloud over his volatile heart. Alas, poor Monmouth! He was ever aweathercock, and even as Wilding's words seemed to strike the courageout of him, so did Grey's short contemptuous answer restore it."As it is, we'll thrust that throne over with our hands," said he aftera moment's pause."Aye," cried Monmouth. "We'll do it, God helping us!""Our dependence and trust is in the Lord of Hosts, in Whose Name wego forth," boomed the voice of Ferguson, quoting from his preciousDeclaration. "The Lord will do that which seemeth good unto Him.""An unanswerable argument," said Wilding, smiling. "But the Lord, I amtold by the gentlemen of your cloth, works in His own good time, and myfears are all lest, finding us unprepared of ourselves, the Lord's goodtime be not yet.""Out on ye, sir," cried Ferguson. "Ye want for reverence!""Common sense will serve us better at the moment," answered Wildingwith a touch of sharpness. He turned to the frowning and perplexedDuke--whose mind was being tossed this way and that, like a shuttlecockupon the battledore of these men's words. "Your Grace," he said,"forgive me that I speak it if hear it you will, or forbid me to say itif your resolve is unalterable in this matter.""It is unalterable," answered Grey for the Duke.But Monmouth gently overruled him for once."Nevertheless, speak by all means, Mr. Wilding. Whatever you may say,you need have no fear that any of us can doubt your good intentions toourselves.""I thank Your Grace. What I have to say is but a repetition of thefirst words I uttered at this table. I would urge Your Grace even now toretreat.""What? Are you mad?" It was Lord Grey who asked the impatient question."I doubt it's over-late for that," said Fletcher slowly."I am not so sure," answered Wilding. "But I am sure that to attempt itwere the safer course--the surer in the end. I myself may not lingerto push forward the task of stirring up the people, for I am alreadysomething more than under suspicion. But there are others who willremain to carry on the work after I have departed with Your Grace, ifYour Grace thinks well. From the Continent by correspondence we canmature our plans. In a twelvemonth things will be very different, and wecan return with confidence."Grey shrugged and turned his shoulder upon Wilding, but said no word.There was silence of some few moments. Andrew Fletcher leaned his elbowon the table and took his brow in his great bony hand. Wilding's wordsseemed an echo of those he himself had spoken a week or two ago, only tobe overruled by Grey, who swayed the Duke more than did any other--andthat he did not do so of fell purpose, and seeking deliberately to workMonmouth's ruin, no man will ever be able to say with certainty.Ferguson rose, a tall, spare, stooping figure, and smote the board withhis fist. "It is a good cause," he cried, "and God will not leave usunless we leave Him.""Henry the Seventh landed with fewer men than did Your Grace," saidGrey, "and he succeeded.""True," put in Fletcher. "But Henry the Seventh was sure of the supportof not a few of the nobility, which does not seem to be our case."Ferguson and Grey stared at him in horror; Monmouth sat biting his lip,more bewildered than thoughtful."O man of little faith!" roared Ferguson in a passion. "Are ye to beswayed like a straw in the wind?""I am no' swayed. Ye ken this was ever my own view. I feel, in my heart,that what Mr. Wilding says is right. It is but what I said myself, andCaptain Matthews with me, before we embarked upon this expedition. Wewere in danger of ruining all by a needless precipitancy. Nay, man,never stare so," he said to Grey, "I am in it now and I am no' the manto draw back, nor do I go so far as Mr. Wilding in counselling such acourse. We've set our hands to the plough; let us go forward in God'sname. Yet I would remind you that what Mr. Wilding says is true. Hadwe waited until next year, we had found the usurper's throne totteringunder him, and, on our landing, it would have toppled o'er of itself.""I have said already that we'll overset it with our hands," Greyanswered."How many hands have you?" asked a new voice, a crisp, discordant voice,much steeped in mockery. It was Nick Trenchard's."Have we another here of Mr. Wilding's mind?" cried Grey, staring athim."I am seldom of any other," answered Trenchard."We shall no' want for hands," Ferguson assured him. "Had ye arrivedearlier ye might have seen how readily men enlisted." He had risen andapproached the window as he spoke; he pulled it open, to let in the fullvolume of sound that rose from the street below."A Monmouth! A Monmouth!" voices shouted.Ferguson struck a theatrical posture, one long, lean arm stretchedoutward from the shoulder."Ye hear them, sirs," he cried, and there was a gleam of triumph in hiseye. "That is answer enough to those who want for faith, to the fecklessones that think the Lord will abandon those that have set out to serveHim," and his glance comprehended Fletcher, Trenchard, and Wilding.The Duke stirred in his chair, stretched a hand for the bottle andfilled a glass. His mercurial spirits were rising again. He smiled atWilding."I think you are answered, sir," said he; "and I hope that like Fletcherthere, who shared your doubts, you will come to agree that since we haveset our hands to the plough we must go forward.""I have said that which I had it on my conscience to say. Your Grace mayhave found me over-ready with my counsel; at least you shall find me noless ready with my sword.""Odso! That is better." Grey applauded, and his manner was almostpleasant."I never doubted it, Mr. Wilding," His Grace replied; "but I should liketo hear you say that you are convinced--at least in part," and hewaved his hand towards the window. It was almost as if he pleaded forencouragement. In common with most men who came in contact with Wilding,he had felt the latent force of this man's nature, the strength that washidden under that calm surface, and the acuteness of the judgment thatmust be wedded to it. He longed to have the word of such a man that hisenterprise was not as desperate as Wilding had seemed at first to paintit. But Wilding made no concession to hopes or desires when he dealtwith facts."Men will flock to you, no doubt; persecution has wearied many of thecountry-folk, and they are ready for revolt. But they are all untrainedin arms; they are rustics, not soldiers. If any of the men of positionwere to rally round your standard they would bring the militia, andothers in their train; they would bring arms, horses, and money, all ofwhich Your Grace must be sorely needing.""They will come," answered the Duke."Some, no doubt," Wilding agreed; "but had it been next year, I wouldhave answered for it that it would have been no handful had ridden into welcome you. Scarce a gentleman of Devon or Somerset, of Dorset orHampshire, of Wiltshire or Cheshire but would have hastened to yourside.""They will come as it is," the Duke repeated with an almost womanishinsistence, persisting in believing what he hoped, all evidence apart.The door opened and Ensign Cragg made his appearance. "May it pleaseYour Grace," he announced, "Mr. Battiscomb has just arrived, and askswill Your Grace receive him to-night?""Battiscomb!" cried the Duke. Again his cheek flushed and his eyesparkled. "Aye, in Heaven's name, show him up.""And may the Lord refresh us with good tidings!" prayed Fergusondevoutly.Monmouth turned to Wilding. "It is the agent I sent ahead of me fromHolland to stir up the gentry from here to the Mersey.""I know," said Wilding; "we conferred together some weeks since.""Now you shall see how idle are your fears," the Duke promised him.And Wilding, who was better informed on that score, kept silence.CHAPTER XIV. HIS GRACE' IN COUNSELMr. Christopher Battiscomb, that mild-mannered Dorchester gentleman,who, like Wade, was by vocation a lawyer, was ushered into the Duke'spresence. He was dressed in black, and, like Ferguson, was almostsmothered in a great periwig, which he may have adopted for purposes ofdisguise rather than adornment. Certainly he had none of that air ofthe soldier of fortune which distinguished his brother of the robe. Headvanced, hat in hand, towards the table, greeting the company about it,and Wilding observed that he wore silk stockings and shoes, upon whichthere rested not a speck of dust. Mr. Battiscomb was plainly a man wholoved his ease, since on such a day he had travelled to Lyme in a coach.The lawyer bent low to kiss the Duke's hand, and scarce was that formalhomage paid than questions poured upon him from Grey, from Fletcher, andfrom Ferguson."Gentlemen, gentlemen," the Duke entreated them, smiling; andremembering their manners they fell silent.As Wilding afterwards told Trenchard, they reminded him of a parcel ofsaucy lacqueys who take liberties with an upstart master for whom theyare wanting in respect."I am glad to see you, Battiscomb," said Monmouth, when quiet wasrestored, "and I trust I behold in you a bearer of good tidings."The lawyer's full face was usually pale; to-night it was, in addition,solemn, and the smile that haunted his lips was a courtesy smile thatexpressed neither mirth nor satisfaction. He cleared his throat, as ifnervous. He avoided the Duke's question as to the quality of the newshe brought by answering that he had made all haste to come to Lyme uponhearing of His Grace's landing. He was surprised, he said; as well hemight be, for the arrangement was that having done his work he was toreturn to Holland and report to Monmouth upon the feeling of the gentry."But your news, Battiscomb," the Duke insisted. "Aye," put in Grey; "inHeaven's name, let us hear that."Again there was the little nervous cough from Battiscomb. "I have scarcehad time to complete my round of visits," he temporized. "Your Gracehas taken us so by surprise. I... I was with Sir Walter Young at Colytonwhen the news of your landing came some few hours ago." His voicefaltered and seemed to die away."Well?" cried the Duke. His brows were drawn together. Already herealized that Battiscomb's tidings were not good, else would he behesitating less in uttering them. "Is Sir Walter with you, at least?""I grieve to say that he is not.""Not?" It was Grey who spoke, and he followed the ejaculation by anoath. "Why not?""He is following, no doubt?" suggested Fletcher."We may hope, sirs," answered Battiscomb, "that in a few days--when heshall have seen the zeal of the countryside--he will be cured of hispresent luke-warmness." Thus, discreetly, did the man of law break thebad news he bore.Monmouth sank back into his chair like one who has lost some ofhis strength. "Lukewarmness?" he repeated dully. "Sir Walter Younglukewarm!""Even so, Your Grace--alas!" and Battiscomb sighed audibly.Ferguson's voice boomed forth again to startle them. "The ox knoweth hisowner," he cried, "the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know,my people doth not consider."Grey pushed the bottle contemptuously across the table to the parson."Drink, man, and get sense, said he, and turned aside to questionBattiscomb touching others of the neighbourhood upon whom they haddepended."What of Sir Francis Rolles?" he inquired.Battiscomb answered the question, addressing himself to the Duke."Alas! Sir Francis, no doubt, would have been faithful to Your Grace,but, unfortunately, Sir Francis is in prison already."Deeper grew Monmouth's frown; his fingers drummed the table absently.Fletcher poured himself wine, his face inscrutable. Grey threw one legover the other and in a voice that was carefully careless he inquired,"And what of Sidney Clifford?""He is considering," said Battiscomb. "I was to have seen him again atthe end of the month; meanwhile, he would take no resolve.""Lord Gervase Scoresby?" questioned Grey, less carelessly.Battiscomb half turned to him, then faced the Duke again as he madeanswer, "Mr. Wilding there, can tell you more concerning Lord Gervase."All eyes swept round to Wilding who sat in silence, listening;Monmouth's were laden with inquiry and some anxiety. Wilding shook hishead slowly, sadly. "You must not depend upon him," he answered; "LordGervase was not yet ripe. A little longer and I think I must have wonhim for Your Grace.""Heaven help us!" exclaimed the Duke in petulant vexation. "Is no onecoming in?"Ferguson swung a hand towards the still open window, drawing attentionto the sounds without."Does Your Grace not hear, that ye can ask?" he cried, almostreproachfully; but they scarce heeded him, for Grey was inquiring ifMr. Strode might be depended upon to join, and that was a matter thatclaimed the greater attention."I think," said Battiscomb, "that he might have been depended upon.""Might have been?" questioned Fletcher, speaking now for the first timesince Battiscomb's arrival."Like Sir Francis Rolles, he is in prison," the lawyer explained.Monmouth leaned forward, and his young face looked careworn now; hethrust a slender hand under the brown curls upon his brow. "Will youtell us, Mr. Battiscomb, upon what friends you think that we may count?"he said.Battiscomb pursed his lips a second, pondering. "I think," said he,"that you may count upon Mr. Legge and Mr. Hooper, and possibly uponColonel Churchill, though I cannot say what following they will bring,if any. Mr. Trenchard, upon whom we counted for fifteen hundred men ofTaunton, has been obliged to fly the country to escape arrest.""We have heard that from Mr. Trenchard's cousin," answered the Duke."What of Prideaux, of Ford? Is he lukewarm?""I was unable to elicit a definite promise from him. But he wasfavourably disposed to Your Grace."His Grace made a gesture that seemed to dismiss Prideaux from theircalculations. "And Mr. Hucker, of Taunton?"Battiscomb's manner grew yet more ill at ease. "Mr. Hucker himself, Iam sure, would place his sword at your disposal. But his brother is ared-hot Tory.""Well, well," sighed the Duke, "I take it we must not make certain ofMr. Hucker. Are there any others besides Legge and Hooper upon whom youthink that we may reckon?""Lord Wiltshire, perhaps," said Battiscomb, but with a lack ofassurance."A plague on perhaps!" exclaimed Monmouth, growing irritable; "I wantyou to name the men of whom you are certain."Battiscomb stood silent for a moment, pondering. He looked almostfoolish, like a schoolboy who hesitates to confess his ignorance of theanswer to a question set him.Fletcher swung round, his grey eyes flashing angrily, his accent moreScottish than ever."Is it that ye're certain o' none, Mr. Battiscomb?" he exclaimed."Indeed," said Battiscomb, "I think we may be fairly certain of Mr.Legge and Mr. Hooper.""And of none besides?" questioned Fletcher again. "Be these the onlyrepresentatives of the flower of England's nobility that is to flock tothe banner of the cause of England's freedom and religion?" Scorn wasstamped on every word of his question.Battiscomb spread his hands, raised his brows, and said nothing."The Lord knows I do not say it exulting," said Fletcher; "but I toldYour Grace yours was hardly the case of Henry the Seventh, as my LordGrey would have you believe.""We shall see," snapped Grey, scowling at the Scot. "The people arecoming in hundreds--aye, in thousands--the gentry will follow; theymust.""Make not too sure, Your Grace--oh, make not too sure," Wilding besoughtthe Duke. "As I have said, these hinds have nothing to lose but theirlives.""Faith, can a man lose more?" asked Grey contemptuously. He dislikedWilding by instinct, which was but a reciprocation of the feeling withwhich Wilding was inspired by him."I think he can," said Mr. Wilding quietly. "A man may lose honour, hemay plunge his family into ruin. These are things of more weight with agentleman than life.""Odds death!" blazed Grey, giving a free rein to his dislike of thiscalm gentleman. "Do you suggest that a man's honour is imperilled in HisGrace's service?""I suggest nothing," answered Wilding, unmoved. "What I think, I state.If I thought a man's honour imperilled in this service, you would notsee me at this table now. I can make you no more convincing answer."Grey laughed unpleasantly, and Wilding, a faint tinge on hischeek-bones, measured him with a stern, intrepid look before which hislordship's shifty glance was observed to fall. Wilding's eye, havingachieved that much, passed from him to the Duke, and its expressionsoftened."Your Grace sees," said he, "how well founded were the fears I expressedthat your coming has been premature.""In God's name, what would you have me do?" cried the Duke, andpetulance made his voice unsteady.Mr. Wilding rose, moved out of his habitual calm by the earnestnessthat pervaded him. "It is not for me to say again what I would have YourGrace do. Your Grace has heard my views, and those of these gentlemen.It is for Your Grace to decide.""You mean whether I will go forward with this thing? What alternativehave I?""No alternative," put in Grey with finality. "Nor is alternative needed.We'll carry this through in spite of timorous folk and birds of ill-omenthat croak to affright us.""Our service is the service of the Lord," cried Ferguson, returning fromthe window in the embrasure of which he had been standing; "the Lordcannot but destine it to prevail.""Ye said so before," quoth Fletcher testily. "We need here men, money,and weapons--not divinity.""You are plainly infected with Mr. Wilding's disease," sneered Grey."Ford," cried the Duke, who saw Wilding's eyes flash fire; "you go toofast. Mr. Wilding, you will not heed his lordship.""I should not be likely to do so, Your Grace," answered Wilding, who hadresumed his seat."What shall that mean?" quoth Grey, leaping to his feet."Make it quite clear to him, Tony," whispered Trenchard coaxingly; butMr. Wilding was not as lost as were these immediate followers of theDuke's to all sense of the respect due to His Grace."I think," said Wilding quietly, "that you have forgotten something.""Forgotten what?" bawled Grey."His Grace's presence."His lordship turned crimson, his anger swelled to think that the veryterms of the rebuke precluded his allowing his feelings a free rein.Monmouth leaned forward. "Sit down," he said to Grey, and Grey, solately called to the respect he owed His Grace, obeyed him. "You willboth promise me that this affair shall go no further. I know you willdo it if I ask you, particularly when you remember how few are thefollowers upon whom I may depend. I am not in case to lose either of youthrough foolish words uttered in a heat which, in both your hearts, isborn, I know, of your loyalty to me."Grey's coarse, elderly face took on a sulky look, his heavy lips werepouted, his glance sullen. Mr. Wilding, on the contrary, smiled acrossthe table."For my part I very gladly give Your Grace the undertaking," said he,and took care not to observe the sneer that altered the line of LordGrey's lips. His lordship, too, was forced to give the same pledge, andhe followed it up by inveighing sturdily against the suggestion thatthey should retreat."I do protest," he exclaimed, "that those who advise Your Grace to doanything but go forward boldly now, are evil counsellors. If you putback to Holland, you may leave every hope behind. There will be nosecond coming for you. Your influence will have been dissipated. Menwill not trust you another time. I do not think that even Mr. Wildingcan deny the truth of this.""I am by no means sure," said Wilding, and Fletcher looked at him witheyes that were full of understanding. This sturdy Scot, the only soldierworthy of the name in the Duke's following, who, ever since the projecthad first been mooted, had held out against it, counselling delay, wasin sympathy with Mr. Wilding.Monmouth rose, his face anxious, his voice fretful. "There can be noretreat for me, gentlemen. Though many that we depended upon are nothere to join us, yet let us remember that Heaven is on our side, andthat we are come to fight in the sacred cause of religion and a nation'semancipation from the thraldom of popery, oppression, and superstition.Let this dispel such doubts as yet may linger in our minds."His words had a brave sound, but, when analysed, they but formed aparaphrase of what Grey and Ferguson had said. It was his destiny to bea mere echo of the minds of other men, just as he was now the toolof these two, one of whom plotted, seemingly, because plotting was adisease that had got into his blood; the other for reasons that may havebeen of ambition or of revenge--no man will ever know for certain.In the chamber they shared, Trenchard and Mr. Wilding reviewed thatnight the scene so lately enacted, in which one had taken an activepart, the other been little more than a spectator. Trenchard had comefrom the Duke's presence entirely out of conceit with Monmouth andhis cause, contemptuous of Ferguson, angry with Grey, and indifferenttowards Fletcher."I am committed, and I'll not draw back," said he; "but I tell you,Anthony, my heart is not confederate with my hand in this. Bah!" herailed. "We serve a man of straw, a Perkin, a very pope of a fellow."Mr. Wilding sighed. "He's scarce the man for such an undertaking," saidhe. "I fear we have been misled."Trenchard was drawing off his boots. He paused in the act. "Aye," saidhe, "misled by our blindness. What else, after all, should we haveexpected of him?" he cried contemptuously. "The Cause is good; but itsleader---Pshaw! Would you have such a puppet as that on the throne ofEngland?""He does not aim so high.""Be not so sure. We shall hear more of the black box anon, and of themarriage certificate it contains. 'Twould not surprise me if they wereto produce forgeries of the one and the other to prove his father'smarriage to Lucy Walters. Anthony, Anthony! To what a business are wewedded?"Mr. Wilding, already abed, turned impatiently. "Things cried aloud to beredressed; a leader was necessary, and none other offered. That is thewhole story. But our chance is slender, and it might have been great.""That rake-hell, Ford, Lord Grey has made it so," grumbled Trenchard,busy with his stockings. "This sudden coming is his work. You heard whatFletcher said--how he opposed it when first it was urged." He paused,and looked up suddenly. "Blister me!" he cried, "is it his lordship'spurpose, think you, to work the ruin of Monmouth?""What are you saying, Nick?""There are certain rumours current touching His Grace and Lady Grey. Aman like Grey might well resort to some such scheme of vengeance.""Get to sleep, Nick," said Wilding, yawning; "you are dreaming already.Such a plan would be over elaborate for his lordship's mind. It wouldask a villainy parallel with your own."Trenchard climbed into bed, and settled himself under the coverlet."Maybe," said he, "and maybe not; but I think that were it not for thatcursed business of the letter Richard Westmacott stole from us, I shouldbe going my ways to-morrow and leaving His Grace of Monmouth to go his.""Aye, and I'd go with you," answered Wilding. "I've little taste forsuicide; but we are in it now.""'Twas a sad pity you meddled this morning in that affair at Taunton,"mused Trenchard wistfully. "A sadder pity you were bitten with a tastefor matrimony," he added thoughtfully, and blew out the rushlight.CHAPTER XV. LYME OF THE KINGOn the next day, which was Friday, the country folk continued to comein, and by evening Monmouth's forces amounted to a thousand foot anda hundred and fifty horse. The men were armed as fast as they wereenrolled, and scarce a field or quiet avenue in the district butresounded to the tramp of feet, the rattle of weapons, and the sharporders of the officers who, by drilling, were converting this rawmaterial into soldiers. On the Saturday the rally of the Duke's standardwas such that Monmouth threw off at last the gloomy forebodings that hadburdened his soul since that meeting on Thursday night. Wade, Holmes,Foulkes, and Fox were able to set about forming the first fourregiments--the Duke's, and the Green, the White, and the Yellow.Monmouth's spirits continued to rise, for he had been joined by nowby Legge and Hooper--the two upon whom Battiscomb had counted--and byColonel Joshua Churchill, of whom Battiscomb had been less certain.Captain Matthews brought news that Lord Wiltshire and the gentlemenof Hampshire might be expected if they could force their way throughAlbemarle's militia, which was already closing round Lyme.Long before evening willing fellows were being turned away in hundredsfor lack of weapons. In spite of Monmouth's big talk on landing, and ofthe rumour that had gone out, that he could arm thirty thousand men, hisstock of arms was exhausted by a mere fifteen hundred. Trenchard,who now held a Major's rank in the horse attached to the Duke's ownregiment, was loud in his scorn of this state of things; Mr. Wilding wassad, and his depression again spread to the Duke after a few words hadpassed between them towards evening. Fletcher was for heroic measures.He looked only ahead now, like the good soldier that he was; and,already, he began to suggest a bold dash for Exeter, for weapons,horses, and possibly the militia as well, for they had ample evidencethat the men composing it might easily be induced to desert to theDuke's side.The suggestion was one that instantly received Mr. Wilding's heartiestapproval. It seemed to fill him suddenly with hope, and he spoke ofit, indeed, as an inspiration which, if acted upon, might yet save thesituation. The Duke was undecided as ever; he was too much troubledweighing the chances for and against, and he would decide upon nothinguntil he had consulted Grey and the others. He would summon a councilthat night, he promised, and the matter should be considered.But that council was never to be called, for Andrew Fletcher'sassociation with the rebellion was drawing rapidly to its close, andthere was that to happen in the next few hours which should counteractall the encouragement with which the Duke had been fortified that day.Towards evening little Heywood Dare, the Taunton goldsmith, who hadlanded at Seatown and gone out with the news of the Duke's arrival, rodeinto Lyme with forty horse, mounted, himself, upon a beautiful chargerwhich was destined to be the undoing of him.News came, too, that the Dorset militia were at Bridport, eight milesaway, whereupon Wilding and Fletcher postponed all further suggestion ofthe dash for Exeter, proposing that in the mean time a night attack uponBridport might result well. For once Lord Grey was in agreement withthem, and so the matter was decided. Fletcher went down to arm andmount, and all the world knows the story of the foolish, ill-fatedquarrel which robbed Monmouth of two of his most valued adherents.By ill-luck the Scot's eyes lighted upon the fine horse that Dare hadbrought from Ford Abbey. It occurred to him that nothing could be morefitting than that the best man should sit upon the best horse, and heforthwith led the beast from the stables and was about to mount whenDare came forth to catch him in the very act. The goldsmith was a rude,peppery fellow, who did not mince his words."What a plague are you doing with that horse?" he cried.Fletcher paused, one foot in the stirrup, and looked the fellow up anddown. "I am mounting it," said he, and proceeded to do as he said.But Dare caught him by the tails of his coat and brought him back toearth."You are making a mistake, Mr. Fletcher," he cried angrily. "That horseis mine."Fletcher, whose temper was by no means of the most peaceful, kepthimself with difficulty in hand at the indignity Dare offered him."Yours?" quoth he."Aye, mine. I brought it from Ford Abbey myself.""For the Duke's service," Fletcher reminded him."For my own, sir; for my own I would have you know." And brushingthe Scot aside, he caught the bridle, and sought to wrench it fromFletcher's hand.But Fletcher maintained his hold. "Softly, Mr. Dare," said he. "Ye'rea trifle o'er true to your name, as you once told his late Majestyyourself.""Take your hands from my horse," Dare shouted, very angry.Several loiterers in the yard gathered round to watch the scene, cullingdiversion from it and speculating upon the conclusion it might have. Onerash young fellow offered audibly to lay ten to one that Paymaster Darewould have the best of the argument.Dare overheard, and was spurred on."I will, by God!" he answered. "Come, Mr. Fletcher!" And he shook thebridle again.There was a dull flush showing through the tan of Fletcher's skin."Mr. Dare," said he, "this horse is no more yours than mine. It is theDuke's, and I, as one o' the leaders, claim it in the Duke's service.""Aye, sir," cried an onlooker, encouraging Fletcher, and did themischief. It so goaded Dare to have his antagonist in this triflingmatter supported that he utterly lost his head."I have said the horse is mine, and I repeat it. Let go the bridle--letit go!" Still, Fletcher, striving hard to keep his calm, clung to thereins. "Let it go, you damned, thieving Scot!" screamed Dare in a fury,and struck Fletcher with his whip.It was unfortunate for them both that he should have had that switch inhis hand at such a time, but more unfortunate still was it that Fletchershould have had a pistol in his belt. The Scot dropped the bridle atlast; dropped it to pluck forth the weapon."Hi! I did not..." began Dare, who had stood appalled by what he haddone in the second or two that had passed since he had delivered theblow. The rest of his sentence was drowned in the report of Fletcher'spistol, and Dare dropped dead on the rough cobbles of the yard.Ferguson has left it on record--and, presumably, he had Fletcher'sword for it--that it was no part of the Scot's intent to do Mr. Darea mischief. He had but drawn the pistol to intimidate him into bettermanners, but in his haste he accidentally pulled the trigger.However that may be, there was Dare as dead as the stones on which helay, and Fletcher with a smoking pistol in his hand.After that all was confusion. Fletcher was seized by those who hadwitnessed the deed; there was none thought it an accident; indeed,they were all ready enough to say that Fletcher had received excessiveprovocation. He was haled to the presence of the Duke with whomwere Grey and Wilding at the time; and old Dare's son--an ensign inGoodenough's company--came clamouring for vengeance backed by suchgoodly numbers that the distraught Duke was forced to show at least theoutward seeming of it.Wilding, who knew the value of this Scottish soldier of fortune who hadseen so much service, strenuously urged his enlargement. It was not atime to let the fortunes of a cause suffer through such an act as this,deplorable though it might be. The evidence showed that Fletcher hadbeen provoked; he had been struck, a thing that might well justify theanger in the heat of which he had done this thing. Grey was stolid andsilent, saying nothing either for or against the man who had dividedwith him under the Duke the honours of the supreme command.Monmouth, white and horror-stricken, sat and listened first toWilding, then to Dare, and lastly to Fletcher himself. But it was youngDare--Dare and his followers, who prevailed. They were too numerous andturbulent, and they must at all costs be conciliated, or there was notelling to what extremes they might not go. And so there was an end tothe share of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun in this undertaking--the end ofthe only man who was of any capacity to pilot it through the troubledwaters that lay before it. Monmouth placed him under arrest and sent himaboard the frigate again, ordering her captain to sail at once. That wasthe utmost Monmouth could do to save him.Wilding continued to plead with the Duke after Fletcher's removal, andto such good purpose that at last Monmouth determined that Fletchershould rejoin them later, when the affair should have blown over, andhe sent word accordingly to the Scot. Even in this there weremanifestations of antagonism between Mr. Wilding and Lord Grey, and italmost seemed enough that Wilding should suggest a course for Lord Greyinstantly to oppose it.The effects of Fletcher's removal were not long in following. On themorrow came the Bridport affair, and Grey's shameful conduct when, hadhe stood his ground, victory must have been assured the Duke's forcesinstead of just that honourable retreat by which Colonel Wade sogallantly saved the situation. Mr. Wilding did not mince his words inputting it that Grey had run away.In his room at the George Inn, Monmouth, deeply distressed, askedWilding and Colonel Matthews what action he should take in thematter--how deal with Grey."There is no other general in Europe would ask that, Your Grace,"answered Matthews gravely, and Mr. Wilding added without an instant'shesitation that His Grace's course was plain."It would be an unwise thing to expose the troops to the chance of moresuch happenings."Monmouth dismissed them and sent for Grey, and he seemed resolved todeal with him as he deserved. Yet an hour later, when Wilding, Matthews,Wade, and the others were ordered to attend the Duke in council, therewas his lordship seemingly on as good terms as ever with His Grace.They were assembled to discuss the next step which it might be advisableto take, for the militia was closing in around them, and to remainlonger in Lyme would be to be caught there as in a trap. It was Greywho advanced the first suggestion, his assurance no whit abated bythe shameful thing that had befallen, by the cowardice which he hadbetrayed."That we must quit Lyme we are all agreed," said he. "I would proposethat Your Grace march north to Gloucester, where our Cheshire friendswill assemble to meet us."Colonel Matthews reminded the Duke of Andrew Fletcher's proposal thatthey should make a raid upon Exeter with a view to seizing arms, ofwhich they stood so sorely in need.This Mr. Wilding was quick to support. "Not only that, Your Grace," hesaid, "but I am confident that with very little inducement the greaterportion of the militia will desert to us as soon as we appear."What assurance can you give of that?" asked Grey, his heavy lipprotruded."I take it," said Mr. Wilding, "that in such matters no man can givean assurance of anything. I speak with knowledge of the country and thefolk from which the militia is enlisted. I offer it as my opinion thatthe militia is favourably disposed to Your Grace. I can do no more."If Mr. Wilding says so, Your Grace," put in Matthews, "I have no doubthe has sound reasons upon which to base his opinion."No doubt," said Monmouth. "Indeed, I had already thought of the stepthat you suggest, Colonel Matthews, and what Mr. Wilding says causes meto look upon it still more favourably."Grey frowned. "Consider, Your Grace," he said earnestly, "that you arein no case to fight at present.""What fighting do you suggest there would be?" asked the Duke."There is Albemarle between us and Exeter.""But with the militia," Wilding reminded him; "and if the militiadeserts him for Your Grace, in what case will Albemarle find himself?""And if the militia does not desert? If you should be proven wrong, sir?What then? What then?" asked Grey."Aye--true--what then, Mr. Wilding?" quoth the Duke, already wavering.Wilding considered a moment, all eyes upon him. "Even then," said hepresently, "I do maintain that in this dash for Exeter lies Your Grace'sgreatest chance of success. We can deliver battle if need be. Already weare three thousand strong..."Grey interrupted him rudely. "Nay," he insisted. "You must not presumeupon that. We are not yet fit to fight. It is His Grace's business atpresent to drill and discipline his troops and induce more friends tojoin him.""Already we are turning men away because we have no weapons to put intotheir hands," Wilding reminded them, and a murmur of approval ran round,which but served to anger Grey the more, to render more obstinate hisopposition."But all that come in are not unprovided," was his lordship's retort."There are the Hampshire gentry and their friends. They will come armed,and so will others if we have patience."Aye," said Wilding, "and if you have patience enough there will betroops the Parliament will send against us. They, too, will be armed, Ican assure your lordship.""In God's name let us keep from wrangling," the Duke besought them. "Itis difficult enough to determine for the best. If the dash to Exeterwere successful...""It cannot be," Grey interrupted again.The liberties he took with Monmouth and which Monmouth permitted himmight well be a source of wonder to all who heard them. Monmouth pausednow in his interrupted speech and looked about him a trifle wearily."It seems idle to insist," said Mr. Wilding; "such is the temper of YourGrace's counsellors, that we get no further than contradictions." Grey'sbold eyes were upon Wilding as he spoke. "I would remind Your Grace,and I am sure that many present will agree with me, that in a desperateenterprise a sudden unexpected movement will often strike terror.""That is true," said Monmouth, but apparently without enthusiasm, andhaving approved what was urged on one side, he looked at Grey, as ifwaiting to hear what might be said on the other. His indecision waspitiful--tragical, indeed, in the leader of so bold an enterprise."We should do better, I think," said Grey, "to deal with the facts as weknow them.""It is what I am endeavouring to do, Your Grace," protested Wilding,a note of despair in his voice. "Perhaps some other gentleman will putforward better counsel than mine.""Aye! In Heaven's name let us hope so," snorted Grey; and Monmouth,catching the sudden flash of Mr. Wilding's eye, set a hand upon hislordship's arm as if to urge him to be gentler. But he continued, "Whenmen talk of striking terror by sudden movements they build on air.""I had hardly thought to hear that from your lordship," said Mr.Wilding, and he permitted himself that tight-lipped smile that gave hisface so wicked a look."And why not?" asked Grey, stupidly unsuspicious."Because I had thought you might have concluded otherwise from your ownexperience at Bridport this morning."Grey got angrily to his feet, rage and shame flushing his face, and itneeded Ferguson and the Duke to restore him to some semblance of calm.Indeed, it may well be that it was to complete this that His Gracedecided there and then that they should follow Grey's advice and go byway of Taunton, Bridgwater, and Bristol to Gloucester. He was, like allweak men, of conspicuous mental short-sightedness. The matter of themoment was ever of greater importance to him than any result that mightattend it in the future.He insisted that Wilding and Grey should shake hands before the breakingup of that most astounding council, and as he had done last night, henow again imposed upon them his commands that they must not allow thismatter to go further.Mr. Wilding paved the way for peace by making an apology withinlimitations."If, in my zeal to serve Your Grace to the best of my ability, I havesaid that which Lord Grey thinks fit to resent, I would bid him considermy motive rather than my actual words."But when all had gone save Ferguson, the chaplain approached thepreoccupied and distressed Duke with counsel that Mr. Wilding should besent away from the army."Else there'll be trouble 'twixt him and Grey," the plotting parsonforetold. "We'll be having a repetition of the unfortunate Fletcher andDare affair, and I think that has cost Your Grace enough already.""Do you suggest that I dismiss Wilding?" cried the Duke. "You know hisinfluence, and the bad impression his removal would leave."Ferguson stroked his long lean jaw. "No, no," said he; "all I suggest isthat you find Mr. Wilding work to do elsewhere.""Elsewhere?" the Duke questioned. "Where else?""I have thought of that, too. Send him to London to see Danvers and tostir up your friends there. And," he added, lowering his voice, "givehim discretion to see Sunderland if he thinks well."The proposition pleased Monmouth, and it seemed to please Mr. Wildingno less when, having sent for him, the Duke communicated it to him inFerguson's presence.Upon this mission Mr. Wilding set out that very night, leaving NickTrenchard in despair at being separated from him at a time when thereseemed to be every chance that such a separation might be eternal.Monmouth and Ferguson may have conceived they did a wise thing inremoving a man who was instinctively spoiling for a little sword-playwith my Lord Grey. It is odds that had he remained, the brewing stormbetween the pair would have come to a head. Had it done so, it is morethan likely, from what we know of Mr. Wilding's accomplishments, thathe had given Lord Grey his quietus. And had that happened, it is tobe inferred from history that it is possible the Duke of Monmouth'srebellion might have had a less disastrous issue.CHAPTER XVI. PLOTS AND PLOTTERSMr. Wilding left Monmouth's army at Lyme on Sunday, the 14th ofJune, and rejoined it at Bridgwater exactly three weeks later. In themeanwhile a good deal had happened, yet the happenings on every hand hadfallen far short of the expectations aroused in Mr. Wilding's mind,now by one circumstance, now by another. In reaching London he hadexperienced no difficulty. Men travelling in that direction were notsubjected to the scrutiny that fell to the share of those travellingfrom it towards the West, or, rather, to the scrutiny ordained by theGovernment; for Wilding had more than one opportunity of observinghow very lax and indifferent were the constables andtything-men--particularly in Somerset and Wiltshire--in the performanceof this duty. Wayfarers were questioned as a matter of form, but in nocase did Wilding hear of any one being detained upon suspicion. Thiswas calculated to raise his drooping hopes, pointing as it did to thegeneral favouring of Monmouth that was toward. He grew less despondenton the score of the Duke's possible ultimate success, and he came tohope that the efforts he went to exert would not be fruitless.But rude were the disappointments that awaited him in town. London, likethe rest of the country, was not ready. There were not wanting men whofavoured Monmouth; but no rising had been organized, and the Duke'spartisans were not disposed to rashness.Wilding lodged at Covent Garden, in a house recommended to him byColonel Danvers, and there--an outlaw himself--he threw himself with awill into his task. He heard of the burning of Monmouth's Declaration bythe common hangman at the Royal Exchange, and of the bill passed bythe Commons to make it treason for any to assert that Lucy Walters wasmarried to the late King. He attended meetings at the "Bull's Head,"in Bishopsgate, where he met Disney and Danvers, Payton and Lock; butthough they talked and argued at prodigious length, they did naughtbesides. Danvers, who was their hope in town, definitely refused to havea hand in anything that was not properly organized, and in common withthe others urged that they should wait until Cheshire had risen, as wasreported that it must.Meanwhile, troops had gone west under Kirke and Churchill, and theParliament had voted nearly half a million for the putting down of therebellion. London was flung into a fever of excitement by the newsthat was reaching it. The position was not quite as Monmouth'sadvisers--before coming over from Holland--had represented that it wouldbe. They had thought that out of fear of tumults about his own person,King James would have been compelled to keep near him what troops hehad, sparing none to be sent against Monmouth. This, King James had notdone; he had all but emptied London of soldiery, and, considering thegeneral disaffection, no moment could have been more favourable thanthis for a rising in London itself. The confusion that must haveresulted from the recalling of troops would have given Monmouth notonly a mighty grip of the West, but would have heartened those who--likeSunderland himself--were sitting on the wall, to declare themselves forthe Protestant Champion. This Wilding saw, and almost frenziedly did heurge it upon Danvers that all London needed at the moment was a resoluteleader. But the Colonel still held back; indeed, he had neither truthnor valour; he was timid, and used deceit to mask his timidity; he urgedfrivolous reasons for inaction, and when Wilding waxed impatient withhim, he suggested that Wilding himself should head the rising if he wereso confident of its success. And Wilding would have done it but that,being unknown in London, he had no reason to suppose that men wouldflock to him if he raised the Duke's banner.Later, when the excitement grew and rumours ran through town thatMonmouth had now a following of twenty thousand men and that the King'sforces were falling back before him, and discontent was rife at thecommissioning of Catholic lords to levy troops, Wilding again pressedthe matter upon Danvers. Surely no moment could be more propitious.But again he received the same answer, that Danvers had lacked time toorganize matters sufficiently; that the Duke's coming had taken him bysurprise.Lastly came the news that Monmouth had been crowned at Taunton amid thewildest enthusiasm, and that there were now in England two men eachof whom called himself King James the Second. This was the excusethat Danvers needed to be rid of a business he had not the courage totransact to a finish. He swore that he washed his hands of Monmouth'saffairs; that the latter had broken faith with him and the promisehe had made him in having himself proclaimed King. He protested thatMonmouth had done ill, and prophesied that his act would alienate fromhim the numerous republicans who, like Danvers, had hitherto looked tohim for the country's salvation. Wilding himself was appalled at thenews for Monmouth was indeed going further than men had been given tounderstand. Nevertheless, for his own sake, in very self-defence now,if out of no motives of loyalty to the Duke, he must urge forward thefortunes of this man. He had high words with Danvers, and the two mighthave quarrelled before long but for the sudden arrest of Disney, whichthrew Danvers into such a panic that he fled incontinently, abandoningin body, as he already appeared to have abandoned in spirit, theMonmouth Cause.The arrest of Disney struck a chill into Wilding. From his lodging atCovent Garden he had communicated cautiously with Sunderland a few daysafter his arrival, building upon certain information he had receivedfrom the Duke at parting as to Sunderland's attachment to the Cause. Hehad carefully chosen his moment for making this communication, havinga certain innate mistrust of a man who so obviously as Sunderland wasrunning with the hare and hunting with the hounds. He had sent a letterto the Secretary of State when London was agog with the Axminsteraffair, and the tale--of which Sir Edward Phelips wrote to ColonelBerkeley as "the shamefullest story that you ever heard"--of howAlbemarle's forces and the Somerset militia had run before Monmouth inspite of their own overwhelming numbers. This promised ill for James,particularly when it was perceived as perceived it was--that thisrunning away was not all cowardice, not all "the shamefullest story"that Phelips accounted it. It was an expression of good-will towardsMonmouth on the part of the militia of the West, and it was confidentlyexpected that the next news would be that these men who had decampedbefore him would presently be found to have ranged themselves under hisbanner.Sunderland had given no sign that he had received Wilding'scommunication. And Wilding drew his own contemptuous conclusions of theSecretary of State's cautious policy. It was a fortnight later--whenLondon was settling down again from the diversion of excitement createdby the news of Argyle's defeat in Scotland--before Mr. Wilding attemptedto approach Sunderland again. He awaited a favourable opportunity, andthis he had when London was thrown into consternation by the alarmingnews of the Duke of Somerset's urgent demand for reinforcements. Unlesshe had them, he declared, the whole country was lost, as he could notget the militia to stand, whilst Lord Stawell's regiment were all fledand mostly gone over to the rebels at Bridgwater.This was grave news, but it was followed in a few days by graver. Theaffair at Philips Norton was exaggerated by report into a wholesaledefeat of the loyal army, and it was reported--on, apparently, such goodauthority that it received credence in quarters that might have waitedfor official news--that the Duke of Albemarle had been slain by themilitia which had mutinied and deserted to Monmouth.It was while this news was going round that Sunderland--in a moment ofpanic--at last vouchsafed an answer to Mr. Wilding's letters, and hevouchsafed it in person, just as Wilding--particularly since Disney'sarrest--was beginning to lose all hope. He came one evening to Mr.Wilding's lodgings in Covent Garden, unattended and closely muffled, andhe remained closeted with the Duke's ambassador for nigh upon an hour,at the end of which he entrusted Mr. Wilding with a letter for the Duke,very brief but entirely to the point, which expressed him Monmouth'smost devoted servant."You may well judge, sir," he had said at parting, "that this is notsuch a letter as I should entrust to any man."Mr. Wilding had bowed gravely, and gravely he had expressed himselfsensible of the exceptional honour his lordship did him by such a trust."And I depend upon you, sir, as you are a man of honour, to take suchmeasures as will ensure against its falling into any but the hands forwhich it is intended.""As I am a man of honour, you may depend upon me," Mr. Wilding solemnlypromised. "Will your lordship give me three lines above your signaturethat will save me from molestation; thus you will facilitate thepreservation of this letter.""I had already thought of that," was Sunderland's answer, and he placedbefore Mr. Wilding three lines of writing signed and sealed whichenjoined all, straitly, in the King's name to suffer the bearer to passand repass and to offer him no hindrance.On that they shook hands and parted, Sunderland to return to Whitehalland his obedience to the King James whom he was ready to betray assoon as he saw profit for himself in the act, Mr. Wilding to return toSomerset to the King James in whom his faith was scant, indeed, but withwhom his fortunes were irrevocably bound up.Meanwhile, Monmouth was back in Bridgwater, his second occupationof which town was not being looked upon with unmixed favour. Theinhabitants had suffered enough already from his first visit; his returnthere, after the Philips Norton affair of which such grossly exaggeratedreports had reached London, and which, in point of fact, had been littlebetter than a drawn battle--had been looked upon with dread by some,with disfavour by others, and with dismay by not a few who viewed inthis an augury of failure.Now Sir Rowland Blake, who since his pursuit of Mr. Wilding andTrenchard on the occasion of their flight from Taunton had--in spiteof his failure on that occasion--been more or less in the service ofAlbemarle and the loyal army, saw in this indisposition towards Monmouthof so many of Bridgwater's inhabitants great possibilities of profit tohimself.He was at Lupton House, the guest of his friend Richard Westmacott, andthe open suitor of Ruth, entirely ignoring the circumstance that she wasnominally the wife of Mr. Wilding--this to the infinite chagrin of MissHorton, who saw all her scheming likely to go for nothing.In his heart of hearts it was a matter of not the slightest consequenceto Sir Rowland whether James Stuart or James Scott occupied the throneof England. His own affairs gave him more than enough to think of, andthese disturbances in the West were very welcome to him, since theyrendered difficult any attempt to trace him on the part of his Londoncreditors. It happens, however, very commonly that enmity to anindividual will lead to enmity to the cause which that individualespouses. Thus may it have been with Sir Rowland. His hatred of Wildingand his keen desire to see Wilding destroyed had made him a zealouspartisan of the loyal cause. Richard Westmacott, easily swayed andoverborne by the town rake, whose vices made him seem to Richard theembodiment of all that is splendid and enviable in man, had becomepractically the baronet's tool, now that he had abandoned Monmouth'sCause. Sir Rowland had not considered it beneath the dignity of his nameand station to discharge in Bridgwater certain functions that made himmore or less a spy. And so reliable had been the information he had sentFeversham and Albemarle during Monmouth's first occupation of the town,that he had won by now their complete confidence.The second occupation and its unpopularity with many of those whoearlier--if lukewarm--had been partisans of the Duke, swelled the numberof loyally inclined people in Bridgwater, and suddenly inspiredSir Rowland with a scheme by which at a blow he might snuff out therebellion.This scheme involved the capture of the Duke, and the reward of successshould mean far more to Blake than the five thousand pounds at which thevalue of the Duke's head had already been fixed by Parliament. He neededa tool for this, and he even thought of Westmacott and Lupton House, butafterwards preferred a Mr. Newlington, who was in better case to assisthim. This Newlington, an exceedingly prosperous merchant and one of therichest men perhaps in the whole West of England, looked with extremedisfavour upon Monmouth, whose advent had paralyzed his industries to anextent that was costing him a fine round sum of money weekly.He was now in alarm lest the town of Bridgwater should be made topay dearly for having harboured the Protestant Duke--he had no faithwhatever in the Protestant Duke's ultimate prevailing--and that he,as one of the town's most prominent and prosperous citizens, mightbe amongst the heaviest sufferers in spite of his neutrality. Thisneutrality he observed because it was hardly safe in that disaffectedtown for a man to proclaim himself a loyalist.To him Sir Rowland expounded his audacious plan... He sought out themerchant in his handsome mansion on the night of that Friday which hadwitnessed Monmouth's return, and the merchant, honoured by the visit ofthis gallant--ignorant as he was of the gentleman's fame in town--placedhimself entirely and instantly at his disposal, though the hour waslate. Sounding him carefully, and finding the fellow most amenableto any scheme that should achieve the salvation of his purse andindustries, Blake boldly laid his plan before him. Startled at first,Mr. Newlington upon considering it became so enthusiastic that he hailedSir Rowland as his deliverer, and heartily promised his cooperation.Indeed, it was Mr. Newlington who was, himself, to take the first step.Well pleased with his evening's work, Sir Rowland went home to LuptonHouse and to bed. In the morning he broached the matter to Richard. Hehad all the vanity of the inferior not only to lessen the appearance ofhis inferiority, but to clothe himself in a mantle of importance; and itwas this vanity urged him to acquaint Richard with his plans in the verypresence of Ruth.They had broken their fast, and they still lingered in the dining-room,the largest and most important room in Lupton House. It was cool andpleasant here in contrast to the heat of the July sun, which, followingupon the late wet weather, beat fiercely on the lawn, the window-doorsto which stood open. The cloth had been raised, and Diana and her motherhad lately left the room. Ruth, in the window-seat, at a small ovaltable, was arranging a cluster of roses in an old bronze bowl. SirRowland, his stiff short figure carefully dressed in a suit of browncamlet, his fair wig very carefully curled, occupied a tall-backedarmchair near the empty fireplace. Richard, perched on the table's edge,swung his shapely legs idly backwards and forwards and cogitated upon apretext to call for a morning draught of last October's ale.Ruth completed her task with the roses and turned her eyes upon herbrother."You are not looking well, Richard," she said, which was true enough,for much hard drinking was beginning to set its stamp on Richard, andyoung as he was, his insipidly fair face began to display a bloatednessthat was exceedingly unhealthy."Oh, I am well enough," he answered almost peevishly, for theseallusions to his looks were becoming more frequent than he savoured."Gad!" cried Sir Rowland's deep voice, "you'll need to be well. I havework for you to-morrow, Dick."Dick did not appear to share his enthusiasm. "I am sick of the work youdiscover for us, Rowland," he answered ungraciously.But Blake showed no resentment. "Maybe you'll find the present task moreto your taste. If it's deeds of derring-do you pine for, I am the manto satisfy you." He smiled grimly, his bold grey eyes glancing across atRuth, who was observing him, listening.Richard sneered, but offered him no encouragement to proceed."I see," said Blake, "that I shall have to tell you the whole storybefore you'll credit me. Shalt have it, then. But..." and he checked onthe word, his face growing serious, his eye wandering to the door, "Iwould not have it overheard--not for a king's ransom," which was moreliterally true than he may have intended it to be.Richard looked over his shoulder carelessly at the door."We have no eavesdroppers," he said, and his voice bespoke his contemptof the gravity of this news of which Sir Rowland made so much inanticipation. He was acquainted with Sir Rowland's ways, and theimportance of them. "What are you considering?" he inquired."To end the rebellion," answered Blake, his voice cautiously lowered.Richard laughed outright. "There are several others consideringthat--notably His Majesty King James, the Duke of Albemarle, and theEarl of Feversham. Yet they don't appear to achieve it.""It is in that particular," said Blake complacently, "that I shalldiffer from them." He turned to Ruth, eager to engage her in theconversation, to flatter her by including her in the secret. Knowing theloyalist principles she entertained, he had no reason to fear that hisplans could other than meet her approval. "What do you say, MistressRuth?" Presuming upon his friendship with her brother, he had taken tocalling her by that name in preference to the other which he could notbring himself to give her. "Is it not an object worthy of a gentleman'sendeavour?""If you can save so many poor people from encompassing their ruin byfollowing that rash young man the Duke of Monmouth, you will indeed bedoing a worthy deed."Blake rose, and made her a leg. "Madam," said he, "had aught beenwanting to cement my resolve, your words would supply it to me. My planis simplicity itself. I propose to capture Monmouth and his principalagents, and deliver them over to the King. And that is all.""A mere nothing," croaked Richard."Could more be needed?" quoth Blake. "Once the rebel army is deprived ofits leaders it will melt and dissolve of itself. Once the Duke is in thehands of his enemies there will be nothing left to fight for. Is it notshrewd?""You are telling us the object rather than the plan," Ruth reminded him."If the plan is as good as the object...""As good?" he echoed, chuckling. "You shall judge." And briefly hesketched for her the springe he was setting with the help of Mr.Newlington. "Newlington is rich; the Duke is in straits for money.Newlington goes to-day to offer him twenty thousand pounds; and the Dukeis to do him the honour of supping at his house to-morrow night to fetchthe money. It is a reasonable request for Mr. Newlington to make underthe circumstances, and the Duke cannot--dare not refuse it.""But how will that advance your project?" Ruth inquired, for Blake hadpaused again, thinking that the rest must be obvious."In Mr. Newlington's orchard I propose to post a score or so of men,well armed. Oh! I shall run no risks of betrayal by engaging Bridgwaterfolk. I'll get the fellows I need from General Feversham. We takeMonmouth at supper, as quietly as may be, with what gentlemen happen tohave accompanied him. We bind and gag the Duke, and we convey him withall speed and quiet out of Bridgwater. Feversham shall send a troop toawait me a mile or so from the town on the road to Weston Zoyland. Weshall join them with our captive, and thus convey him to the RoyalistGeneral. Could aught be simpler or more infallible?"Richard had slipped from the table. He had changed his mind on thesubject of the importance of the business Blake had in view. Excited byit, he clapped his friend on the back approvingly."A great plan!" he cried. "Is it not, Ruth?""It should be the means of saving hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives,"said she, "and so it deserves to prosper. But what of the officers whomay be with the Duke?" she inquired."There are not likely to be many--half a dozen, say. We shall have tomake short work of them, lest they should raise an alarm." He saw herglance clouding. "That is the ugly part of the affair," he was quickto add, himself assuming a look of sadness. He sighed. "What help isthere?" he asked. "Better that those few should suffer than that, as youyourself have said, there should be some thousands of lives lost beforethis rebellion is put down. Besides," he continued, "Monmouth's officersare far-seeing, ambitious men, who have entered into this affair topromote their own personal fortunes. They are gamesters who have settheir lives upon the board against a great prize, and they know it. Butthese other poor misguided people who have gone out to fight for libertyand religion--it is these whom I am striving to rescue."His words sounded fervent, his sentiments almost heroic. Ruth looked athim, and wondered had she misjudged him in the past. She sighed. Thenshe thought of Wilding. He was on the other side, but where was he?Rumour ran that he was dead; that he and Grey had quarrelled at Lyme,and that Wilding had been killed as a result. Had it not been for Diana,who strenuously bade her attach no credit to these reports, she wouldreadily have believed them. As it was she waited, wondering, thinking ofhim always as she had seen him on that day at Walford when he had takenhis leave of her, and more than once, when she pondered the words he hadsaid, the look that had invested his drooping eyes, she found herselfwith tears in her own. They welled up now, and she rose hastily to herfeet.She looked a moment at Blake who was watching her keenly, speculatingupon this emotion of which she betrayed some sign, and wondering mightnot his heroism have touched her, for, as we have seen, he had arrayeda deed of excessive meanness, a deed worthy, almost, of the Iscariot, inthe panoply of heroic achievement."I think," she said, "that you are setting your hand to a very worthyand glorious enterprise, and I hope, nay, I am sure, that success mustattend your efforts." He was still bowing his thanks when she passed outthrough the open window-doors into the sunshine of the garden.Sir Rowland swung round upon Richard. "A great enterprise, Dick," hecried; "I may count upon you for one?""Aye," said Dick, who had found at last the pretext that he needed,"you may count on me. Pull the bell, we'll drink to the success of theventure."CHAPTER XVII. MR. WILDING'S RETURNThe preparations to be made for the momentous coup Sir Rowland meditatedwere considerable. Mr. Newlington was yet to be concerted with andadvised, and, that done, Sir Rowland had to face the difficulty ofeluding the Bridgwater guards and make his way to Feversham's camp atSomerton to enlist the general's cooperation to the extent that wehave seen he looked for. That done, he was to return and ripen hispreparations for the business he had undertaken. Nevertheless, in spiteof all that lay before him, he did not find it possible to leave LuptonHouse without stepping out into the garden in quest of Ruth. Throughthe window, whilst he and Richard were at their ale, he had watched herbetween whiles, and had lingered, waiting; for Diana was with her, andit was not his wish to seek her whilst Diana was at hand. Speak withher, ere he went, he must. He was an opportunist, and now, he fondlyimagined, was his opportunity. He had made that day, at last, afavourable impression upon Richard's sister; he had revealed himself inan heroic light, and egregiously misreading the emotion she had shownbefore withdrawing, he was satisfied that did he strike now victory mustattend him. He sighed his satisfaction and pleasurable anticipation. Hehad been wary and he had known how to wait; and now, it seemed to him,he was to be rewarded for his patience. Then he frowned, as anotherglance showed him that Diana still lingered with her cousin; he wishedDiana at the devil. He had come to hate this fair-haired doll to whomhe had once paid court. She was too continually in his way, a constantobstacle in his path, ever ready to remind Ruth of Anthony Wilding whenSir Rowland most desired Anthony Wilding to be forgotten; and in Diana'sfeelings towards himself such a change had been gradually wrought thatshe had come to reciprocate his sentiments--to hate him with all thebitter hatred into which love can be by scorn transmuted. At first herobject in keeping Ruth's thoughts on Mr. Wilding, in pleading his cause,and seeking to present him in a favourable light to the lady whom he hadconstrained to become his wife, had been that he might stand a barrierbetween Ruth and Sir Rowland to the end that Diana might hope to seerevived--faute de mieux, since possible in no other way--the feelingsthat once Sir Rowland had professed for herself. The situation wasrich in humiliations for poor, vain, foolishly crafty Diana, and thesehumiliations were daily rendered more bitter by Sir Rowland's unwaveringcourtship of her cousin in spite of all that she could do.In the end the poison of them entered her soul, corroded her sentimentstowards him, dissolved the love she had borne him, and transformedit into venom. She would not have him now if he did penitence for hisdisaffection by going in sackcloth and crawling after her on his kneesfor a full twelvemonth. But neither should he have Ruth if she couldthwart his purpose. On that she was resolved.Had she but guessed that he watched them from the windows, waiting forher to take her departure, she had lingered all the morning, and allthe afternoon if need be, at Ruth's side. But being ignorant ofthe circumstance--believing that he had already left the house--shepresently quitted Ruth to go indoors, and no sooner was she gone thanthere was Blake replacing her at Ruth's elbow. Mistress Wilding met himwith unsmiling, but not ungentle face."Not yet gone, Sir Rowland?" she asked him, and a less sanguine man hadbeen discouraged by the words."It may be forgiven me that I tarry at such a time," said he, "when weconsider that I go, perhaps--to return no more." It was an inspirationon his part to assume the role of the hero going forth to a possibledeath. It invested him with noble, valiant pathos which could not, hethought, fail of its effect upon a woman's mind. But he looked in vainfor a change of colour, be it ever so slight, or a quickening of thebreath. He found neither; though, indeed, her deep blue eyes seemed tosoften as they observed him."There is danger in this thing that you are undertaking?" said she,between question and assertion."It is not my wish to overstate it; yet I leave you to imagine what therisk may be.""It is a good cause," said she, thinking of the poor, deluded, humblefolk that followed Monmouth's banner, whom Blake's fine action was torescue from impending ruin and annihilation, "and surely Heaven will beon your side.""We must prevail," cried Blake with kindling eye, and you had thoughthim a fanatic, not a miserable earner of blood-money. "We mustprevail, though some of us may pay dearly for the victory. I have aforeboding..." He paused, sighed, then laughed and flung back his head,as if throwing off some weight that had oppressed him.It was admirably played; Nick Trenchard, had he observed it, might haveenvied the performance; and it took effect with her, this adding of aprospective martyr's crown to the hero's raiment he had earlier donned.It was a master-touch worthy of one who was deeply learned--from theschool of foul experience--in the secret ways that lead to a woman'sfavour. In a pursuit of this kind there was no subterfuge too mean, notreachery too base for Sir Rowland Blake."Will you walk, mistress?" he said, and she, feeling that it were anunkindness not to do his will, assented gravely. They moved down thesloping lawn, side by side, Sir Rowland leaning on his cane, bareheaded,his feathered hat tucked under his arm. Before them the river's smoothexpanse, swollen and yellow with the recent rains, glowed like a sheetof copper, so that it blurred the sight to look upon it long.A few steps they took with no word uttered, then Sir Rowland spoke."With this foreboding that is on me," said he, "I could not go withoutseeing you, without saying something that I may never have anotherchance of saying; something that--who knows?--but for the emprise towhich I am now wedded you had never heard from me."He shot her a furtive, sidelong glance from under his heavy, beetlingbrows, and now, indeed, he observed a change ripple over the composureof her face like a sudden breeze across a sheet of water. The deep lacecollar at her throat rose and fell, and her fingers toyed nervously witha ribbon of her grey bodice. She recovered in an instant, and threw upentrenchments against the attack she saw he was about to make."You exaggerate, I trust," said she. "Your forebodings will be provedgroundless. You will return safe and sound from this venture, as indeedI hope you may."That was his cue. "You hope it?" he cried, arresting his step, turning,and imprisoning her left hand in his right. "You hope it? Ah, if youhope for my return, return I will; but unless I know that you will havesome welcome for me such as I desire from you, I think..." hisvoice quivered cleverly, "I think, perhaps, it were well if... ifmy forebodings were not as groundless as you say they are. Tell me,Ruth..."But she interrupted him. It was high time, she thought. Her face he sawwas flushed, her eyes had hardened somewhat. Calmly she disengaged herhand."What is't you mean?" she asked. "Speak, Sir Rowland, speak plainly,that I may give you a plain answer."It was a challenge in which another man had seen how hopeless was hiscase, and, accepting defeat, had made as orderly a retreat as still waspossible. But Sir Rowland, stricken in his vanity, went headlong on toutter rout."Since you ask me in such terms I will be plain, indeed," he answeredher. "I mean..." He almost quailed before the look that met him from herintrepid eyes. "Do you not see my meaning, Ruth?""That which I see," said she, "I do not believe, and as I would notwrong you by any foolish imaginings, I would have you plain with me."Yet the egregious fool went on. "And why should you not believe yoursenses?" he asked her, between anger and entreaty. "Is it wonderful thatI should love you? Is it...?""Stop!" She drew back a pace from him. There was a moment's silence,during which it seemed she gathered her forces to destroy him, and,in the spirit, he bowed his head before the coming storm. Then, with asudden relaxing of the stiffness her lissom figure had assumed, "I thinkyou had better leave me, Sir Rowland," she advised him. She half turnedand moved a step away; he followed with lowering glance, his upper liplifting and laying bare his powerful teeth. In a stride he was besideher."Do you hate me, Ruth?" he asked her hoarsely."Why should I hate you?" she counter-questioned, sadly. "I do not evendislike you," she continued in a more friendly tone, adding, as if byway of explaining this phenomenon, "You are my brother's friend. But Iam disappointed in you, Sir Rowland. You had, I know, no intention ofoffering me disrespect; and yet it is what you have done.""As how?" he asked."Knowing me another's wife..."He broke in tempestuously. "A mock marriage! If it is but that scruplestands between us...""I think there is more," she answered him. "You compel me to hurt you; Ido so as the surgeon does--that I may heal you.""Why, thanks for nothing," he made answer, unable to repress a sneer.Then, checking himself, and resuming the hero-martyr posture, "I go,mistress," he told her sadly, "and if I lose my life to-night, orto-morrow, in this affair...""I shall pray for you," said she; for she had found him out atlast, perceived the nature of the bow he sought to draw across herheart-strings, and, having perceived it, contempt awoke in her. He hadattempted to move her by unfair, insidious means.He fell back, crimson from chin to brow. He stifled the wrath thatwelled up, threatening to choke him. He was a short-necked man, of thesort--as Trenchard had once reminded him--that falls a prey to apoplexy,and surely he was never nearer it than at that moment. He made her aprofound bow, bending himself almost in two before her in a very ironyof deference; then, drawing himself up again, he turned and left her.The plot which with some pride he had hatched and the reward he lookedto cull from it, were now to his soul as ashes to his lips. What couldit profit him to destroy Monmouth so that Anthony Wilding lived? Forwhether she loved Wilding or not, she was Wilding's wife. Wilding,nominally, at least, was master of that which Sir Rowland coveted;not her heart, indeed, but her ample fortune. Wilding had been astumbling-block to him since he had come to Bridgwater; but for Wildinghe might have run a smooth course; he was still fool enough to hugthat dear illusion to his soul. Somewhere in England--if not deadalready--this Wilding lurked, an outlaw, whom any might shoot down atsight. Sir Rowland swore he would not rest until he knew that AnthonyWilding cumbered the earth no more--leastways, not the surface of it.He went forth to seek Newlington. The merchant had sent his messageto the rebel King, and had word in answer that His Majesty would begraciously pleased to sup at Mr. Newlington's at nine o'clock onthe following evening, attended by a few gentlemen of his immediatefollowing. Sir Rowland received the news with satisfaction, and sighedto think that Mr. Wilding--still absent, Heaven knew where--would not beof the party. It was reported that on the Monday Monmouth was to marchto Gloucester, hoping there to be joined by his Cheshire friends, sothat it seemed Sir Rowland had not matured his plan a day too soon.He got to horse, and contriving to win out of Bridgwater, rode off toSomerton to concert with Lord Feversham concerning the men he would needfor his undertaking.That night Richard made free talk of the undertaking to Diana and toRuth, loving, as does the pusillanimous, to show himself engaged indaring enterprises. Emulating his friend Sir Rowland, he held forthwith prolixity upon the great service he was to do the State, and Ruth,listening to him, was proud of his zeal, the sincerity of which it neverentered her mind to doubt.Diana listened, too, but without illusions concerning Master Richard,and she kept her conclusions to herself.During the afternoon of the morrow, which was Sunday, Sir Rowlandreturned to Bridgwater, his mission to Feversham entirely successful,and all preparations made. He completed his arrangements, and towardseight o'clock that night the twenty men sent by Feversham--they hadslipped singly into the town--began to muster in the orchard at the backof Mr. Newlington's house.It was just about that same hour that Mr. Wilding, saddle-worn anddust-clogged in every pore, rode into Bridgwater, and made his way tothe sign of The Ship in the High Street, overlooking the Cross whereTrenchard was lodged. His friend was absent--possibly gone with his mento the sermon Ferguson was preaching to the army in the Castle Fields.Having put up his horse, Mr. Wilding, all dusty as he was, repairedstraight to the Castle to report himself to Monmouth.He was informed that His Majesty was in council. Nevertheless, urgingthat his news was of importance, he begged to be instantly announced.After a pause, he was ushered into a lofty, roomy chamber where, inthe fading daylight, King Monmouth sat in council with Grey and Wade,Matthews, Speke, Ferguson, and others. At the foot of the table stood asturdy country-fellow, unknown to Wilding. It was Godfrey, the spy, whowas to act as their guide across Sedgemoor that night; for the matterthat was engaging them just then was the completion of their plansfor the attack that was to be made that very night upon Feversham'sunprepared camp--a matter which had been resolved during the last fewhours as an alternative preferable to the retreat towards Gloucesterthat had at first been intended.Wilding was shocked at the change that had been wrought in Monmouth'sappearance during the few weeks since last he had seen him. His facewas thin, pale, and haggard, his eyes were more sombre, and beneath themthere were heavy, dark stains of sleeplessness and care, his very voice,when presently he spoke, seemed to have lost the musical timbre that hadearlier distinguished it; it was grown harsh and rasping. Disappointmentafter disappointment, set down to ill-luck, but in reality the fruit ofincompetence, had served to sour him. The climax had been reached inthe serious desertions after the Philips Norton fight, and the flightof Paymaster Goodenough with the funds for the campaign. The company satabout the long oak table on which a map was spread, and Colonel Wade wasspeaking when Wilding entered.On his appearance Wade ceased, and every eye was turned upon themessenger from London. Ferguson, fresh from his sermon, sat with elbowsresting on the table, his long chin supported by his hands, his eyesgleaming sharply under the shadow of his wig which was pulled down infront to the level of his eyebrows.It was the Duke who addressed Mr. Wilding, and the latter's keen earswere quick to catch the bitterness that underlay his words."We are glad to see you, sir; we had not looked to do so again.""Not looked to do so, Your Gr... Majesty!" he echoed, plainly notunderstanding, and it was observed that he stumbled over the Duke's newtitle."We had imagined that the pleasures of the town were claiming yourentire attention."Wilding looked from one to the other of the men before him, and on theface of all he saw a gravity that amounted to disapproval of him."The pleasures of the town?" said he, frowning, and again--"thepleasures of the town? There is something in this that I fear I do notunderstand.""Do you bring us news that London has risen?" asked Grey suddenly."I would I could," said Wilding, smiling wistfully."Is it a laughing matter?" quoth Grey angrily."A smiling matter, my lord," answered Wilding, nettled. "Your lordshipwill observe that I did but smile.""Mr. Wilding," said Monmouth darkly, "we are not pleased with you.""In that case," returned Wilding, more and more irritated, "Your Majestyexpected of me more than was possible to any man.""You have wasted your time in London, sir," the Duke explained. "We sentyou thither counting upon your loyalty and devotion to ourselves. Whathave you done?""As much as a man could..." Wilding began, when Grey again interruptedhim."As little as a man could," he answered. "Were His Grace not the mostfoolishly clement prince in Christendom, a halter would be your rewardfor the fine things you have done in London."Mr. Wilding stiffened visibly, his long white face grew set, and hisslanting eyes looked wicked. He was not a man readily moved to anger,but to be greeted in such words as these by one who constituted himselfthe mouthpiece of him for whom Wilding had incurred ruin was more thanhe could bear with equanimity; that the risks to which he had exposedhimself in London--where, indeed, he had been in almost hourlyexpectation of arrest and such short shrift as poor Disney had--shouldbe acknowledged in such terms as these, was something that turned himalmost sick with disgust. To what manner of men had he leagued himself?He looked Grey steadily between the eyes."I mind me of an occasion on which such a charge of foolish clemencymight, indeed--and with greater justice--have been levelled against HisMajesty," said he and his calm was almost terrible.His lordship grew pale at the obvious allusion to Monmouth's mildtreatment of him for his cowardice at Bridport, and his eyes were asbaleful as Wilding's own at that moment. But before he could speak,Monmouth had already answered Mr. Wilding."You are wanting in respect to us, sir," he admonished him.Mr. Wilding bowed to the rebuke in a submission that seemed ironical.The blood mounted slowly to Monmouth's cheeks."Perhaps," put in Wade, who was anxious for peace, "Mr. Wilding has someexplanation to offer us of his failure."His failure! They took too much for granted. Stitched in the lining ofhis boot was the letter from the Secretary of State. To have achievedthat was surely to have achieved something."I thank you, sir, for supposing it," answered Wilding, his voice hardwith self-restraint; "I have indeed an explanation.""We will hear it," said Monmouth condescendingly, and Grey sneered,thrusting out his bloated lips."I have to offer the explanation that Your Majesty is served in Londonby cowards; self-sufficient and self-important cowards who have hinderedme in my task instead of helping me. I refer particularly to ColonelDanvers."Grey interrupted him. "You have a rare effrontery, sir--aye, by God! Doyou dare call Danvers a coward?""It is not I who so call him; but the facts. Colonel Danvers has runaway."Danvers gone?" cried Ferguson, voicing the consternation of all.Wilding shrugged and smiled; Grey's eye was offensively upon him. Heelected to answer the challenge of that glance. "He has followedthe illustrious example set him by other of Your Majesty's devotedfollowers," said Wilding.Grey rose suddenly. This was too much. "I'll not endure it from thisknave!" he cried, appealing to Monmouth.Monmouth wearily waved him to a seat; but Grey disregarded the command."What have I said that should touch your lordship?" asked Wilding, and,smiling sardonically, he looked into Grey's eyes."It is not what you have said. It is what you have inferred.""And to call me knave!" said Wilding in a mocking horror.The repression of his anger lent him a rare bitterness, and an almostdevilishly subtle manner of expressing wordlessly what was passing inhis mind. There was not one present but gathered from his utterance ofthose five words that he did not hold Grey worthy the honour ofbeing called to account for that offensive epithet. He made just anexclamatory protest, such as he might have made had a woman applied theterm to him.Grey turned from him slowly to Monmouth. "It might be well," said he,in his turn controlling himself at last, "to place Mr. Wilding underarrest."Mr. Wilding's manner quickened on the instant from passive to activeanger."Upon what charge, sir?" he demanded sharply. In truth it was theonly thing wanting that, after all that he had undergone, he should bearrested. His eyes were upon the Duke's melancholy face, and his angerwas such that in that moment he vowed that if Monmouth acted upon thissuggestion of Grey's he should not have so much as the consolation ofSunderland's letter."You have been wanting in respect to us, sir," the Duke answered him.He seemed able to do little more than repeat himself. "You return fromLondon empty-handed, your task unaccomplished, and instead of a becomingcontrition, you hector it here before us in this manner." He shook hishead. "We are not pleased with you, Mr. Wilding.""But, Your Grace," exclaimed Wilding, "is it my fault that your Londonagents had failed to organize the rising? That rising should have takenplace, and it would have taken place had Your Majesty been more ablyrepresented there.""You were there, Mr. Wilding," said Grey with heavy sarcasm."Would it no' be better to leave Mr. Wilding's affair until afterwards?"suggested Ferguson at that moment. "It is already past eight, YourMajesty, and there be still some details of this attack to settle thatyour officers may prepare for it, whilst Mr. Newlington awaits YourMajesty to supper at nine.""True," said Monmouth, ever ready to take a solution offered by another."We will confer with you again later, Mr. Wilding."Wilding bowed, accepting his dismissal. "Before I go, Your Majesty,there are certain things I would report..." he began."You have heard, sir," Grey broke in. "Not now. This is not the time.""Indeed, no. This is not the time, Mr. Wilding," echoed the Duke.Wilding set his teeth in the intensity of his vexation."What I have to tell Your Majesty is of importance," he exclaimed, andMonmouth seemed to waver, whilst Grey looked disdainful unbelief of theimportance of any communication Wilding might have to make."We have little time, Your Majesty," Ferguson reminded Monmouth."Perhaps," put in friendly Wade, "Your Majesty might see Mr. Wilding atMr. Newlington's.""Is it really necessary?" quoth Grey.This treatment of him inspired Mr. Wilding with malice. The mere mentionof Sunderland's letter would have changed their tone. But he electedby no such word to urge the importance of his business. It should beentirely as Monmouth should elect or be constrained by these gentlemenabout his council-table."It would serve two purposes," said Wade, whilst Monmouth stillconsidered. "Your Majesty will be none too well attended, your officershaving this other matter to prepare for. Mr. Wilding would form anotherto swell your escort of gentlemen.""I think you are right, Colonel Wade," said Monmouth. "We sup at Mr.Newlington's at nine o'clock, Mr. Wilding. We shall expect you to attendus there. Lieutenant Cragg," said His Grace to the young officer who hadadmitted Wilding, and who had remained at attention by the door, "youmay reconduct Mr. Wilding."Wilding bowed, his lips tight to keep in the anger that cravedexpression. Then, without another word spoken, he turned and departed."An insolent, overbearing knave!" was Grey's comment upon him after hehad left the room."Let us attend to this, your lordship," said Speke, tapping themap. "Time presses," and he invited Wade to continue the matter thatWilding's advent had interrupted.CHAPTER XVIII. BETRAYALStill smarting under the cavalier treatment he had received, Mr. Wildingcame forth from the Castle to find Trenchard awaiting him among thecrowd of officers and men that thronged the yard.Nick linked his arm through his friend's and led him away. They quittedthe place in silence, and in silence took their way south towards theHigh Street, Nick waiting for Mr. Wilding to speak, Mr. Wilding's mindstill in turmoil at the things he had endured. At last Nick haltedsuddenly and looked keenly at his friend in the failing light."What a plague ails you, Tony?" said he sharply. "You are as silent as Iam impatient for your news."Wilding told him in brief, disdainful terms of the reception theyhad given him at the Castle, and of how they had blamed him for thecircumstance that London had failed to proclaim itself for Monmouth.Trenchard snarled viciously. "'Tis that mongrel Grey," said he. "Oh,Anthony, to what an affair have we set our hands? Naught can prosperwith that fellow in it." He laid his hand on Wilding's arm and loweredhis voice. "As I have hinted before, 'twould not surprise me if timeproved him a traitor. Failure attends him everywhere, and so unfailinglythat one wonders is not failure invited by him. And that fool Monmouth!Pshaw! See what it is to serve a weakling. With another in his placeand the country disaffected as it is, we had been masters of England bynow."Two ladies passed them at that moment, cloaked and hooded, walkingbriskly. One of them turned to look at Trenchard, who, waving his armsin wild gesticulation, was a conspicuous object. She checked in herwalk, arresting her companion."Mr. Wilding!" she exclaimed. It was Lady Horton."Mr. Wilding!" cried Diana, her companion.Wilding doffed his hat and bowed, Trenchard following his example."We had scarce looked to see you in Bridgwater again," said the mother,her mild, pleasant countenance reflecting the satisfaction it gave herto behold him safe and sound."There have been moments," answered Wilding, "when myself I scarceexpected to return. Your ladyship's greeting shows me what I had losthad I not done so.""You are but newly arrived?" quoth Diana, scanning him in the gloaming."From London, an hour since.""An hour?" she echoed, and observed that he was still booted anddust-stained. "You will have been to Lupton House?"A shadow crossed his face, his glance seemed to grow clouded, all ofwhich watchful Diana did not fail to observe. "Not yet," said he."You are a laggard," she laughed at him, and he felt the blood drivenback upon his heart. What did she mean? Was it possible she suggestedthat he should be welcome, that his wife's feelings towards him hadundergone a change? His last parting from her on the road near Walfordhad been ever in his mind."I have had weighty business to transact, he replied, and Trenchardsnorted, his mind flying back to the council-room at the Castle, andwhat his friend had told him."But now that you have disposed of that you will sup with us," said LadyHorton, who was convinced that since Ruth had gone to the altar withhim he was Ruth's lover in spite of the odd things she had heard.Appearances with Lady Horton counted for everything, and all thatglittered was gold to her."I would," he answered, "but that I am to sup at Mr. Newlington's withHis Majesty. My visit must wait until to-morrow.""Let us hope," said Trenchard, "that it waits no longer." He was alreadyinstructed touching the night attack on Feversham's camp on Sedgemoor,and thought it likely Wilding would accompany them."You are going to Mr. Newlington's?" said Diana, and Trenchard thoughtshe had turned singularly pale. Her hand was over her heart, her eyeswide. She seemed about to add something, but checked herself. She tookher mother's arm. "We are detaining Mr. Wilding, mother," said she,and her voice quivered as if her whole being were shaken by some gustyagitation. They spoke their farewells briefly, and moved on. A secondlater Diana was back at their side again."Where are you lodged, Mr. Wilding?" she inquired."With my friend Trenchard--at the sign of The Ship, by the Cross."She briefly acknowledged the information, rejoined her mother, andhurried away with her.Trenchard stood staring after them a moment. "Odd!" said he; "did youmark that girl's discomposure?"But Wilding's thoughts were elsewhere. "Come, Nick! If I am to rendermyself fit to sit at table with Monmouth, we'll need to hasten."They went their way, but not so fast as went Diana, urging with her herprotesting and short-winded mother."Where is your mistress?" the girl asked excitedly of the first servantshe met at Lupton House."In her room, madam," the man replied, and to Ruth's room went Dianabreathlessly, leaving Lady Horton gaping after her and understandingnothing.Ruth, who was seated pensive by her window, rose on Diana's impetuousentrance, and in the deepening twilight she looked almost ghostly in hergown of shimmering white satin, sewn with pearls about the neck of thelow-cut bodice."Diana!" she cried. "You startled me.""Not so much as I am yet to do," answered Diana, breathing excitement.She threw back the wimple from her head, and pulling away her cloak,tossed it on to the bed. "Mr. Wilding is in Bridgwater," she announced.There was a faint rustle from the stiff satin of Ruth's gown. "Then..."her voice shook slightly. "Then... he is not dead," she said, morebecause she felt that she must say something than because her wordsfitted the occasion."Not yet," said Diana grimly."Not yet?""He sups to-night at Mr. Newlington's," Miss Horton exclaimed in a voicepregnant with meaning."Ah!" It was a cry from Ruth, sharp as if she had been stabbed. She sankback to her seat by the window, smitten down by this sudden news.There was a pause, which fretted Diana, who now craved knowledge of whatmight be passing in her cousin's mind. She advanced towards Ruth andlaid a trembling hand on her shoulder, where the white gown met theivory neck. "He must be warned," she said."But... but how?" stammered Ruth. "To warn him were to betray SirRowland.""Sir Rowland?" cried Diana in high scorn."And... and Richard," Ruth continued."Yes, and Mr. Newlington, and all the other knaves that are engaged inthis murderous business. Well?" she demanded. "Will you do it, or mustI?""Do it?" Ruth's eyes sought her cousin's white, excited face in thequasi-darkness. "But have you thought of what it will mean? Have youthought of the poor people that will perish unless the Duke is taken andthis rebellion brought to an end?""Thought of it?" repeated Diana witheringly. "Not I. I have thought thatMr. Wilding is here and like to have his throat cut before an hour ispast.""Tell me, are you sure of this?" asked Ruth."I have it from your husband's own lips," Diana answered, and told herin a few words of her meeting with Mr. Wilding.Ruth sat with hands folded in her lap, her eyes on the dim violetafter-glow in the west, and her mind wrestling with this problem thatDiana had brought her."Diana," she cried at last, "what am I to do?""Do?" echoed Diana. "Is it not plain? Warn Mr. Wilding.""But Richard?""Mr. Wilding saved Richard's life...""I know. I know. My duty is to warn him.""Then why hesitate?""My duty is also to keep faith with Richard, to think of those poormisguided folk who are to be saved by this," cried Ruth in an agony. "IfMr. Wilding is warned, they will all be ruined."Diana stamped her foot impatiently. "Had I thought to find you in thismind, I had warned him myself," said she."Ah! Why did you not?""That the chance of doing so might be yours. That you might thus repayhim the debt in which you stand.""Diana, I can't!" The words broke from her in a sob.But whatever her interest in Mr. Wilding for her own sake, Diana's primeintent was the thwarting of Sir Rowland Blake. If Wilding were warnedof what manner of feast was spread at Newlington's, Sir Rowland would beindeed undone."You think of Richard," she exclaimed, "and you know that Richard is tohave no active part in the affair--that he will run no risk. They haveassigned him but a sentry duty that he may warn Blake and his followersif any danger threatens them.""It is not of Richard's life I am thinking, but of his honour, of histrust in me. To warn Mr. Wilding were... to commit an act of betrayal.""And is Mr. Wilding to be slaughtered with his friends?" Diana askedher. "Resolve me that. Time presses. In half an hour it will be toolate."That allusion to the shortness of the time brought Ruth an inspiration.Suddenly she saw a way. Wilding should be saved, and yet she would notbreak faith with Richard nor ruin those others. She would detain him,and whilst warning him at the last moment, in time for him to savehimself; not do so until it must be too late for him to warn the others.Thus she would do her duty by him, and yet keep faith with Richard andSir Rowland. She had resolved, she thought, the awful difficulty thathad confronted her. She rose suddenly, heartened by the thought."Give me your cloak and wimple," she bade Diana, and Diana flew to doher bidding. "Where is Mr. Wilding lodged?" she asked."At the sign of The Ship--overlooking the Cross, with Mr. Trenchard.Shall I come with you?""No," answered Ruth without hesitation. "I will go alone." She drew thewimple well over her head, so that in its shadows her face might lieconcealed, and hid her shimmering white dress under Diana's cloak.She hastened through the ill-lighted streets, never heeding the roughcobbles that hurt her feet, shod in light indoor wear, never heeding thecrowds that thronged her way. All Bridgwater was astir with Monmouth'spresence; moreover, there had been great incursions from Taunton and thesurrounding country, the women-folk of the Duke-King's followers havingcome that day to Bridgwater to say farewell to father and son, husbandand brother, before the army marched--as was still believed--toGloucester.The half-hour was striking from Saint Mary's--the church in which shehad been married--as Ruth reached the door of the sign of The Ship. Shewas about to knock, when suddenly it opened, and Mr. Wilding himself,with Trenchard immediately behind him, stood confronting her. At sightof him a momentary weakness took her. He had changed from his hard-usedriding-garments into a suit of roughly corded black silk, which threwinto relief the steely litheness of his spare figure. His dark brownhair was carefully dressed, diamonds gleamed in the cravat of snowy laceat his throat. He was uncovered, his hat under his arm, and he stoodaside to make way for her, imagining that she was some woman of thehouse."Mr. Wilding," said she, her heart fluttering in her throat. "May I...may I speak with you?"He leaned forward, seeking to pierce the shadows of her wimple; he hadthought he recognized the voice, as his sudden start had shown; andyet he disbelieved his ears. She moved her head at that moment, and thelight streaming out from a lamp in the passage beat upon her white face."Ruth!" he cried, and came quickly forward. Trenchard, behindhim, looked on and scowled with sudden impatience. Mr. Wilding'sphilanderings with this lady had never had the old rake's approval. Toomuch trouble already had resulted from them."I must speak with you at once. At once!" she urged him, her tonefearful."Are you in need of me?" he asked concernedly."In very urgent need," said she."I thank God," he answered without flippancy. "You shall find me at yourservice. Tell me.""Not here; not here," she answered him."Where else?" said he. "Shall we walk?""No, no." Her repetitions marked the deep excitement that possessed her."I will go in with you." And she signed with her head towards the doorfrom which he was barely emerged."'Twere scarce fitting," said he, for being confused and full ofspeculation on the score of her need, he had for the moment almostoverlooked the relations in which they stood. In spite of the ceremonythrough which they had gone together, Mr. Wilding still mostly thoughtof her as of a mistress very difficult to woo."Fitting?" she echoed, and then after a pause, "Am I not your wife?" sheasked him in a low voice, her cheeks crimsoning."Ha! 'Pon honour, I had almost forgot," said he, and though the burdenof his words seemed mocking, their tone was sad.Of the passers-by that jostled them a couple had now paused to watch ascene that had an element of the unusual in it. She pulled her wimplecloser to her face, took him by the arm, and drew him with her into thehouse."Close the door," she bade him, and Trenchard, who had stood aside thatthey might pass in, forestalled him in obeying her. "Now lead me to yourroom, said she, and Wilding in amaze turned to Trenchard as if askinghis consent, for the lodging, after all, was Trenchard's."I'll wait here," said Nick, and waved his hand towards an oak benchthat stood in the passage. "You had best make haste," he urged hisfriend; "you are late already. That is, unless you are of a mind to setthe lady's affairs before King Monmouth's. And were I in your place,Anthony, faith I'd not scruple to do it. For after all," he added underhis breath, "there's little choice in rotten apples."Ruth waited for some answer from Wilding that might suggest he wasindifferent whether he went to Newlington's or not; but he spoke no wordas he turned to lead the way above-stairs to the indifferentparlour which with the adjoining bedroom constituted Mr. Trenchard'slodging--and his own, for the time being.Having assured herself that the curtains were closely drawn, she put byher cloak and hood, and stood revealed to him in the light of thethree candles, burning in a branch upon the bare oak table, dazzlinglybeautiful in her gown of ivory-white.He stood apart, cogitating her with glowing eyes, the faintest smilebetween question and pleasure hovering about his thin mouth. He hadclosed the door, and stood in silence waiting for her to make known tohim her pleasure."Mr. Wilding..." she began, and straightway he interrupted her."But a moment since you did remind me that I have the honour to be yourhusband," he said with grave humour. "Why seek now to overcloud thatfact? I mind me that the last time we met you called me by another name.But it may be," he added as an afterthought, "you are of opinion that Ihave broken faith with you.""Broken faith? As how?""So!" he said, and sighed. "My words were of so little account that theyhave been, I see, forgotten. Yet, so that I remember them, that is whatchiefly matters. I promised then--or seemed to promise--that I wouldmake a widow of you, who had made a wife of you against your will. Ithas not happened yet. Do not despair. This Monmouth quarrel is not yetfought out. Hope on, my Ruth."She looked at him with eyes wide open--lustrous eyes of sapphire ina face of ivory. A faint smile parted her lips, the reflection of thethought in her mind that had she, indeed, been eager for his death shewould not be with him at this moment; had she desired it, how easy wouldher course have been."You do me wrong to bid me hope for that," she answered him, her toneslevel. "I do not wish the death of any man, unless..." She paused; hertruthfulness urged her too far."Unless?" said he, brows raised, polite interest on his face."Unless it be His Grace of Monmouth."He considered her with suddenly narrowed eyes. "You have not by chancesought me to talk politics?" said he. "Or..." and he suddenly caught hisbreath, his nostrils dilating with rage at the bare thought that leaptinto his mind. Had Monmouth, the notorious libertine, been to LuptonHouse and persecuted her with his addresses? "Is it that you areacquainted with His Grace?" he asked."I have never spoken to him!" she answered, with no suspicion of whatwas in his thoughts.In his relief he laughed, remembering now that Monmouth's affairs weretoo absorbing just at present to leave him room for dalliance."But you are standing," said he, and he advanced a chair. "I deplorethat I have no better hospitality to offer you. I doubt if I ever shallagain. I am told that Albemarle did me the honour to stable his knackersin my hall at Zoyland."She took the chair he offered her, sinking to it like one physicallyweary, a thing he was quick to notice. He watched her, his body eager,his soul trammelling it with a steely restraint. "Tell me, now," saidhe, "in what you need me."She was silent a moment, pondering, hesitation and confusion seeming toenvelop her. A pink flush rose to colour the beautiful pillar of neckand overspread the delicate half-averted face. He watched it, wondering."How long," she asked him, her whole intent at present being to delayhim and gain time. "How long have you been in Bridgwater?""Two hours at most," said he."Two hours! And yet you never came to... to me. I heard of yourpresence, and I feared you might intend to abstain from seeking me."He almost held his breath while she spoke, caught in amazement. He wasstanding close beside her chair, his right hand rested upon its tallback."Did you so intend?" she asked him."I told you even now," he answered with hard-won calm, "that I had madeyou a sort of promise.""I... I would not have you keep it," she murmured. She heard his sharplyindrawn breath, felt him leaning over her, and was filled with anunaccountable fear."Was it to tell me this you came?" he asked her, his voice reduced to awhisper."No... yes," she answered, an agony in her mind, which groped for somemeans to keep him by her side until his danger should be overpast. Thatmuch she owed him in honour if in nothing else."No--yes?" he echoed, and he had drawn himself erect again. "What is'tyou mean, Ruth?""I mean that it was that, yet not quite only that.""Ah!" Disappointment vibrated faintly in his clamation. "What else?""I would have you abandon Monmouth's following," she told him.He stared a moment, moved away and round where he could confront her.The flush had now faded from her face. This he observed and the heaveof her bosom in its low bodice. He knit his brows, perplexed. Here wassurely more than at first might seem."Why so?" he asked."For your own safety's sake," she answered him."You are oddly concerned for that, Ruth.""Concerned--not oddly." She paused an instant, swallowed hard, and thencontinued. "I am concerned too for your honour, and there is no honourin following his banner. He has crowned himself King, and so provedhimself a self-seeker who came dissembled as the champion of a causethat he might delude poor ignorant folk into flocking to his standardand helping him to his ambitious ends.""You are wondrously well schooled," said he. "Whose teachings do yourecite me? Sir Rowland Blake's?"At another time the sneer might have cut her. At the moment she was toointent upon gaining time. The means to it mattered little. The more shetalked to no purpose, the more at random was their discourse, the betterwould her ends be served."Sir Rowland Blake?" she cried. "What is he to me?""Ah, what? Let me set you the question rather.""Less than nothing," she assured him, and for some moments afterwards itwas this Sir Rowland who served them as a topic for their odd interview.On the overmantel the pulse of time beat on from a little wooden clock.His eyes strayed to it; it marked the three-quarters. He bethoughthim suddenly of his engagement. Trenchard, below-stairs, supremelyindifferent whether Wilding went to Newlington's or not, smoked on,entirely unconcerned by the flight of time."Mistress," said Wilding suddenly, "you have not yet told me in what youseek my service. Indeed, we seem to have talked to little purpose. Mytime is very short.""Where are you going?" she asked him, and fearfully she shot a sidelongglance at the timepiece. It was still too soon, by at least fiveminutes.He smiled, but his smile was singular. He began to suspect at last thather only purpose--to what end he could not guess--was to detain him."'Tis a singularly sudden interest in my doings, this," said he quietly."What is't you seek of me?" He reached for the hat he had cast upon thetable when they had entered. "Tell me briefly. I may stay no longer."She rose, her agitation suddenly increasing, afraid that after all hewould escape her. "Where are you going?" she asked. "Answer me that, andI will tell you why I came.""I am to sup at Mr. Newlington's in His Majesty's company."His Majesty's?""King Monmouth's," he explained impatiently. "Come, Ruth. Already I amlate.""If I were to ask you not to go," she said slowly, and she held out herhands to him, her glance most piteous--and that was not acting--as sheraised it to meet his own, "would you not stay to pleasure me?"He considered her from under frowning eyes. "Ruth," he said, and he tookher hands, "there is here something that I do not understand. What is'tyou mean?""Promise me that you will not go to Newlington's, and I will tell you.""But what has Newlington to do with...? Nay, I am pledged already togo."She drew closer to him, her hands upon his shoulders. "Yet if I askyou--I, your wife?" she pleaded, and almost won him to her will.But suddenly he remembered another occasion on which, for purposes ofher own, she had so pleaded. He laughed softly, mockingly."Do you woo me, Ruth, who, when I wooed you, would have none of me?"She drew back from him, crimsoning. "I think I had better go," said she."You have nothing but mockery for me. It was ever so. Who knows?" shesighed as she took up her mantle. "Had you but observed more gentleways, you... you..." She paused, needing to say no more. "Good-night!"she ended, and made shift to leave. He watched her, deeply mystified.She had gained the door when suddenly he moved."Wait!" he cried. She paused, and turned to look over her shoulder, herhand apparently upon the latch. "You shall not go until you have toldme why you besought me to keep away from Newlington's. What is it?" heasked, and paused suddenly, a flood of light breaking in upon his mind."Is there some treachery afoot?" he asked her, and his eye went wildlyto the clock. A harsh, grating sound rang through the room. "What areyou doing?" he cried. "Why have you locked the door?" She was tuggingand fumbling desperately to extract the key, her hands all clumsy in hernervous haste. He leapt at her, but in that moment the key came away inher hand. She wheeled round to face him, erect, defiant almost."Here is some devilry!" he cried. "Give me that key."He had no need for further questions. Here was a proof more eloquentthan words to his ready wit. Sir Rowland or Richard, or both, were insome plot for the Duke's ruin--perhaps assassination. Had not her verywords shown that she herself was out of all sympathy with Monmouth? Hewas out of sympathy himself. But not to the extent of standing by to seehis throat cut. She would have the plot succeed--whatever it might beand yet that he himself be spared. There his thoughts paused; but onlyfor a moment. He saw suddenly in this, not a proof of concern born oflove but of duty towards him who had imperilled himself once--and forall time, indeed--that he might save her brother and Sir Rowland.He told her what had been so suddenly revealed to him, taxing her withit. She acknowledged it, her wits battling to find some way by whichshe might yet gain a few moments more. She would cling to the key, andthough he should offer her violence, she would not let it go without astruggle, and that struggle must consume the little time yet wanting tomake it too late for him to save the Duke, and--what imported more--thussave herself from betraying her brother's trust. Another fear leapt ather suddenly. If through deed of hers Monmouth was spared that night,Blake, in his despair and rage, might slake his vengeance upon Richard."Give me that key," he demanded, his voice cold and quiet, his face set."No, no," she cried, setting her hand behind her. "You shall not go,Anthony. You shall not go.""I must," he insisted, still cold, but oh! so determined. "My honour'sin it now that I know.""You'll go to your death," she reminded him.He sneered. "What signifies a day or so? Give me the key.""I love you, Anthony!" she cried, livid to the lips."Lies!" he answered her contemptuously. "The key!""No," she answered, and her firmness matched his own. "I will not haveyou slain.""'Tis not my purpose--not just yet. But I must save the others. Godforgive me if I offer violence to a woman," he added, "and lay rudehands upon her. Do not compel me to it." He advanced upon her, but she,lithe and quick, evaded him, and sprang for the middle of the room. Hewheeled about, his self-control all slipping from him now. Suddenly shedarted to the window, and with the hand that clenched the key shesmote a pane with all her might. There was a smash of shivering glass,followed an instant later by a faint tinkle on the stones below, and thehand that she still held out covered itself all with blood."O God!" he cried, the key and all else forgotten. "You are hurt.""But you are saved," she cried, overwrought, and staggered, laughing andsobbing, to a chair, sinking her bleeding hand to her lap, and smearingrecklessly her spotless, shimmering gown.He caught up a chair by its legs, and at a single blow smashed down thedoor--a frail barrier after all. "Nick!" he roared. "Nick!" He tossedthe chair from him and vanished into the adjoining room to reappear amoment later carrying basin and ewer, and a shirt of Trenchard's--thefirst piece of linen he could find.She was half fainting, and she let him have his swift, masterful way.He bathed her hand, and was relieved to find that the injury was none sogreat as the flow of blood had made him fear. He tore Trenchard'sfine cambric shirt to shreds--a matter on which Trenchard afterwardscommented in quotations from at least three famous Elizabethandramatists. He bound up her hand, just as Nick made his appearance atthe splintered door, his mouth open, his pipe, gone out, between hisfingers. He was followed by a startled serving-wench, the only otherperson in the house, for every one was out of doors that night.Into the woman's care Wilding delivered his wife, and without a word toher he left the room, dragging Trenchard with him. It was striking nineas they went down the stairs, and the sound brought as much satisfactionto Ruth above as dismay to Wilding below.CHAPTER XIX. THE BANQUETIt was striking nine. Therefore, Ruth thought that she had achieved herobject, Wilding imagined that all was lost. It needed the more tranquilmind of Nicholas Trenchard to show him the fly in madam's ointment,after Wilding, in half a dozen words, had made him acquainted with thesituation."What are you going to do?" asked Trenchard."Run to Newlington's and warn the Duke--if still in time.""And thereby precipitate the catastrophe? Oh, give it thought. It is allit needs. You are taking it for granted that nine o'clock is the hourappointed for King Monmouth's butchery.""What else?" asked Wilding, impatient to be off.They were standing in the street under the sign of The Ship, by whichJonathan Edney--Mr. Trenchard's landlord--distinguished his premises andthe chandler's trade he drove there. Trenchard set a detaining hand onMr. Wilding's arm."Nine o'clock is the hour appointed for supper. It is odds the Duke willbe a little late, and it is more than odds that when he does arrive, theassassins will wait until the company is safely at table and lulled bygood eating and drinking. You had overlooked that, I see. It asks an oldhead for wisdom, after all. Look you, Anthony. Speed to Colonel Wade asfast as your legs can carry you, and get a score of men. Then findsome fellow to lead you to Newlington's orchard, and if only you do notarrive too late you may take Sir Rowland and his cut-throats in the rearand destroy them to a man before they realize themselves attacked. I'llreconnoitre while you go, and keep an eye on the front of the house.Away with you!"Ordinarily Wilding was a man of a certain dignity, but you had notthought it had you seen him running in silk stockings and silver-buckledshoes at a headlong pace through the narrow streets of Bridgwater,in the direction of the Castle. He overset more than one, and oathsfollowed him from these and from others whom he rudely jostled out ofhis path. Wade was gone with Monmouth, but he came upon Captain Slape,who had a company of scythes and musketeers incorporated in the Duke'sown regiment, and to him Wilding gasped out the news and his request fora score of men with what breath was left him.Time was lost--and never was time more precious--in convincing Slapethat this was no old wife's tale. At last, however, he won his way andtwenty musketeers; but the quarter-past the hour had chimed ere theyleft the Castle. He led them forth at a sharp run, with never a thoughtfor the circumstance that they would need their breath anon, perhaps forfighting, and he bade the man who guided them take them by back streetsthat they might attract as little attention as possible.Within a stone's-throw of the house he halted them, and sent oneforward to reconnoitre, following himself with the others as quietly andnoiselessly as possible. Mr. Newlington's house was all alight, but fromthe absence of uproar--sounds there were in plenty from the main street,where a dense throng had collected to see His Majesty go in--Mr. Wildinginferred with supreme relief that they were still in time. Butthe danger was not yet past. Already, perhaps, the assassins werepenetrating--or had penetrated--to the house; and at any moment suchsounds might greet them as would announce the execution of theirmurderous design.Meanwhile Mr. Trenchard, having relighted his pipe, and set his hatrakishly atop his golden wig, strolled up the High Street, swinginghis long cane very much like a gentleman taking the air in quest of anappetite for supper. He strolled past the Cross and on until he cameto the handsome mansion--one of the few handsome houses inBridgwater--where opulent Mr. Newlington had his residence. A smallcrowd had congregated about the doors, for word had gone forth that HisMajesty was to sup there. Trenchard moved slowly through the people,seemingly uninterested, but, in fact, scanning closely every face heencountered. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he espied in theindifferent light Mr. Richard Westmacott.Trenchard passed him, jostling him as he went, and strolled on some fewpaces, then turned, and came slowly back, and observed that Richard hadalso turned and was now watching him as he approached. He was all butupon the boy when suddenly his wrinkled face lighted with recognition."Mr. Westmacott!" he cried, and there was surprise in his voice.Richard, conscious that Trenchard must no doubt regard him as aturn-tippet, flushed, and stood aside to give passage to the other.But Mr. Trenchard was by no means minded to pass. He clapped a handon Richard's shoulder. "Nay," he cried, between laughter and feignedresentment. "Do you bear me ill-will, lad?"Richard was somewhat taken aback. "For what should I bear you ill-will,Mr. Trenchard?" quoth he.Trenchard laughed frankly, and so uproariously that his hatover-jauntily cocked was all but shaken from his head. "I mind me thelast time we met, I played you an unfair trick," said he. His tonebespoke the very highest good-humour. He slipped his arm throughRichard's. "Never bear an old man malice, lad," said he."I assure you that I bear you none," said Richard, relieved to find thatTrenchard apparently knew nothing of his defection, yet wishing thatTrenchard would go his ways, for Richard's task was to stand sentrythere."I'll not believe you till you afford me proof," Trenchard replied. "Youshall come and wash your resentment down in the best bottle of Canarythe White Cow can furnish us.""Not now, I thank you," answered Richard."You are thinking of the last occasion on which I drank with you," saidTrenchard reproachfully."Not so. But... but I am not thirsty.""Not thirsty?" echoed Trenchard. "And is that a reason? Why, lad, it isthe beast that drinks only when he thirsts. And in that lies one of themain differences between beast and man. Come on"--and his arm effected agentle pressure upon Richard's, to move him thence. But at that moment,down the street with a great rumble of wheels, cracking of whipsand clatter of hoofs, came a coach, bearing to Mr. Newlington's KingMonmouth escorted by his forty life-guards. Cheering broke from thecrowd as the carriage drew up, and the Duke-King as he alightedturned his handsome face, on which shone the ruddy glow of torches, toacknowledge these loyal acclamations. He passed up the steps, at the topof which Mr. Newlington--fat and pale and monstrously overdressed--stoodbowing to welcome his royal visitor. Host and guest vanished, followedby some six officers of Monmouth's, among whom were Grey and Wade.The sight-seers flattened themselves against the walls as the greatlumbering coach put about and went off again the way it had come, thelife-guards following after.Trenchard fancied that he caught a sigh of relief from Richard, but thestreet was noisy at the time and he may well have been mistaken."Come," said he, renewing his invitation, "we shall both be the betterfor a little milk of the White Cow."Richard wavered almost by instinct. The White Cow, he knew, was famousfor its sack; on the other hand, he was pledged to Sir Rowland tostand guard in the narrow lane at the back where ran the wall of Mr.Newlington's garden. Under the gentle suasion of Trenchard's arm, hemoved a few steps up the street; then halted, his duty battling with hisinclination."No, no," he muttered. "If you will excuse me...""Not I," said Trenchard, drawing from his hesitation a shrewd inferenceas to Richard's business. "To drink alone is an abomination I'll not beguilty of.""But..." began the irresolute Richard."Shalt urge me no excuses, or we'll quarrel. Come," and he moved on,dragging Richard with him.A few steps Richard took unwillingly under the other's soft compulsion;then, having given the matter thought--he was always one to take theline of least resistance--he assured himself that his sentryship wasentirely superfluous; the matter of Blake's affair was an entire secret,shared only by those who had a hand in it. Blake was quite safe from allsurprises; Trenchard was insistent and it was difficult to deny him;and the sack at the White Cow was no doubt the best in Somerset. He gavehimself up to the inevitable and fell into step alongside his companionwho babbled aimlessly of trivial matters. Trenchard felt the change fromunwilling to willing companionship, and approved it.They mounted the three steps and entered the common room of the inn.It was well thronged at the time, but they found places at the end of along table, and there they sat and discussed the landlady's Canary forthe best part of a half-hour, until a sudden spatter of musketry, nearat hand, came to startle the whole room.There was a momentary stillness in the tavern, succeeded by an excitedclamouring, a dash for the windows and a storm of questions, towhich none could return any answer. Richard had risen with a suddenexclamation, very pale and scared of aspect. Trenchard tugged at hissleeve."Sit down," said he. "Sit down. It will be nothing.""Nothing?" echoed Richard, and his eyes were suddenly bent on Trenchardin a look in which suspicion was now blent with terror.A second volley of musketry crackled forth at that moment, and the nextthe whole street was in an uproar. Men were running and shots resoundedon every side, above all of which predominated the cry that His Majestywas murdered.In an instant the common room of the White Cow was emptied of everyoccupant save two--Trenchard and Westmacott. Neither of them felt theneed to go forth in quest of news. They knew how idle was the cry inthe streets. They knew what had taken place, and knowing it, Trenchardsmoked on placidly, satisfied that Wilding had been in time, whilstRichard stood stricken and petrified by dismay at realizing, with evengreater certainty, that something had supervened to thwart, perhapsto destroy, Sir Rowland. For he knew that Blake's party had gone fortharmed with pistols only, and intent not to use even these save inthe last extremity; to avoid noise they were to keep to steel. Thisknowledge gave Richard positive assurance that the volleys they hadheard must have been fired by some party that had fallen upon Blake'smen and taken them by surprise.And it was his fault! He was the traitor to whom perhaps a score of menowed their deaths at that moment! He had failed to keep watch as he hadundertaken. His fault it was--No! not his, but this villain's who satthere smugly taking his ease and pulling at his pipe.At a blow Richard dashed the thing from his companion's mouth andfingers.Trenchard looked up startled."What the devil...?" he began."It is your fault, your fault!" cried Richard, his eyes blazing, hislips livid. "It was you who lured me hither."Trenchard stared at him in bland surprise. "Now, what a plague is'tyou're saying?" he asked, and brought Richard to his senses by awakingin him the instinct of self-preservation.How could he explain his meaning without betraying himself?--and surelythat were a folly, now that the others were no doubt disposed of. Lethim, rather, bethink him of his own safety. Trenchard looked at himkeenly, with well-assumed intent to read what might be passing in hismind, then rose, paid for the wine, and expressed his intention ofgoing forth to inquire into these strange matters that were happening inBridgwater.Meanwhile, those volleys fired in Mr. Newlington's orchard hadcaused--as well may be conceived--an agitated interruption of the superbfeast Mr. Newlington had spread for his noble and distinguished guests.The Duke had for some days been going in fear of his life, for alreadyhe had been fired at more than once by men anxious to earn the priceat which his head was valued; instantly he surmised that whatever thatfiring might mean, it indicated some attempt to surprise him with thefew gentlemen who attended him.The whole company came instantly to its feet, and Colonel Wade steppedto a window that stood open--for the night was very warm. The Duketurned for explanation to his host; the trader, however, professedhimself entirely unable to offer any. He was very pale and his limbswere visibly trembling, but then his agitation was most natural. Hiswife and daughter supervened at that moment, in their alarm entering theroom unceremoniously, in spite of the august presence, to inquire intothe meaning of this firing, and to reassure themselves that their fatherand his illustrious guests were safe.From the windows they could observe a stir in the gardens below. Blackshadows of men flitted to and fro, and a loud, rich voice was heardcalling to them to take cover, that they were betrayed. Then a sheet oflivid flame blazed along the summit of the low wall, and a second volleyof musketry rang out, succeeded by cries and screams from the assailedand the shouts of the assailers who were now pouring into the gardenthrough the battered doorway and over the wall. For some momentssteel rang on steel, and pistol-shots cracked here and there to theaccompaniment of voices, raised some in anger, some in pain. But it wassoon over, and a comparative stillness succeeded.A voice called up from the darkness under the windows to know if HisMajesty was safe. There had been a plot to take him; but the ambuscadershad been ambuscaded in their turn, and not a man of them remained--whichwas hardly exact, for under a laurel bush, scarce daring to breathe, laySir Rowland Blake, livid with fear and fury, and bleeding from a rapierscratch in the cheek, but otherwise unhurt.In the room above, Monmouth had sunk wearily into his chair upon hearingof the design there had been against his life. A deep, bitter melancholyenwrapped his spirit. Lord Grey's first thoughts flew to the man hemost disliked--the one man missing from those who had been bidden toaccompany His Majesty, whose absence had already formed the subjectof comment. Grey remembered this bearing before the council that sameevening, and his undisguised resentment of the reproaches levelledagainst him."Where is Mr. Wilding?" he asked suddenly, his voice dominating thedin of talk that filled the room. "Do we hold the explanation of hisabsence?"Monmouth looked up quickly, his beautiful eyes ineffably sad, his weakmouth drooping at the corners. Wade turned to confront Grey."Your lordship does not suggest that Mr. Wilding can have a hand inthis?""Appearances would seem to point in that direction," answered Grey, andin his wicked heart he almost hoped it might be so."Then appearances speak truth for once," came a bitter, ringing voice.They turned, and there on the threshold stood Mr. Wilding. Unheard hehad come upon them. He was bareheaded and carried his drawn sword. Therewas blood upon it, and there was blood on the lace that half concealedthe hand that held it; otherwise--and saving that his shoes andstockings were sodden with the dew from the long grass in theorchard--he was as spotless as when he had left Ruth in Trenchard'slodging; his face, too, was calm, save for the mocking smile with whichhe eyed Lord Grey.Monmouth rose on his appearance, and put his hand to his sword in alarm.Grey whipped his own from the scabbard, and placed himself slightly infront of his master as if to preserve him."You mistake, sirs," said Wilding quietly. "The hand I have had in thisaffair has been to save Your Majesty from your enemies. At the moment Ishould have joined you, word was brought me of the plot that was laid,of the trap that was set for you. I hastened to the Castle and obtaineda score of musketeers of Slape's company. With those I surprised themurderers lurking in the garden there, and made an end of them. Igreatly feared I should not come in time; but it is plain that Heavenpreserves Your Majesty for better days."In the revulsion of feeling, Monmouth's eyes shone moist. Grey sheathedhis sword with an awkward laugh, and a still more awkward word ofapology to Wilding. The Duke, moved by a sudden impulse to make amendsfor his unworthy suspicions, for his perhaps unworthy reception ofWilding earlier that evening in the council-room, drew the sword onwhich his hand still rested. He advanced a step."Kneel, Mr. Wilding," he said in a voice stirred by emotion. ButWilding's stern spirit scorned this all too sudden friendliness ofMonmouth's as much as he scorned the accolade at Monmouth's hands."There are more pressing matters to demand Your Majesty's attention,"said Mr. Wilding coldly, advancing to the table as he spoke, and takingup a napkin to wipe his blade, "than the reward of an unworthy servant."Monmouth felt his sudden enthusiasm chilled by that tone and manner."Mr. Newlington," said Mr. Wilding, after the briefest of pauses, andthe fat, sinful merchant started forward in alarm. It was like a summonsof doom. "His Majesty came hither, I am informed, to receive at yourhands a sum of money--twenty thousand pounds--towards the expensesof the campaign. Have you the money at hand?" And his eye, glitteringbetween cruelty and mockery, fixed itself upon the merchant's ashenface."It... it shall be forthcoming by morning," stammered Newlington."By morning?" cried Grey, who, with the others, watched Mr. Newlingtonwhat time they all wondered at Mr. Wilding's question and the manner ofit."You knew that I march to-night," Monmouth reproached the merchant."And it was to receive the money that you invited His Majesty to do youthe honours of supping with you here," put in Wade, frowning darkly.The merchant's wife and daughter stood beside him watching him, andplainly uneasy. Before he could make any reply, Mr. Wilding spoke again."The circumstance that he has not the money by him is a little odd--orwould be were it not for what has happened. I would submit, YourMajesty, that you receive from Mr. Newlington not twenty thousand poundsas he had promised you, but thirty thousand, and that you receive it notas a loan as was proposed, but as a fine imposed upon him in consequenceof... his lack of care in the matter of his orchard."Monmouth looked at the merchant very sternly. "You have heard Mr.Wilding's suggestion," said he. "You may thank the god of traitors itwas made, else we might have thought of a harsher course. You shall paythe money by ten o'clock to-morrow to Mr. Wilding, whom I shall leavebehind for the sole purpose of collecting it." He turned from Newlingtonin plain disgust. "I think, sirs, that here is no more to be done. Arethe streets safe, Mr. Wilding?""Not only safe, Your Majesty, but the twenty men of Slape's and your ownlife-guards are waiting to escort you.""Then in God's name let us be going," said Monmouth, sheathing his swordand moving towards the door. Not a second time did he offer to conferthe honour of knighthood upon his saviour.Mr. Wilding turned and went out to marshal his men. The Duke and hisofficers followed more leisurely. As they reached the door, a woman'scry broke the silence behind them. Monmouth turned. Mr. Newlington,purple of face and his eyes protruding horridly, was beating the airwith his hands. Suddenly he collapsed, and crashed forward with armsflung out amid the glass and silver of the table all spread with thetraitor's banquet to which he had bidden his unsuspecting victim.His wife and daughter ran to him and called him by name, Monmouthpausing a moment to watch them from the doorway with eyes unmoved. ButMr. Newlington answered not their call, for he was dead.CHAPTER XX. THE RECKONINGRuth had sped home through the streets unattended, as she had come,heedless of the rude jostlings and ruder greetings she met with fromthose she passed; heedless, too, of the smarting of her injured hand,for the agony of her soul was such that it whelmed all minor sufferingsof the flesh.In the dining-room at Lupton House she came upon Diana and Lady Hortonat supper, and her appearance--her white and distraught face andblood-smeared gown--brought both women to their feet in alarmed inquiry,no less than it brought Jasper, the butler, to her side with readysolicitude. Ruth answered him that there was no cause for fear, that shewas quite well--had scratched her hand, no more; and with that dismissedhim. When she was alone with her aunt and cousin, she sank into a chairand told them what had passed 'twixt her husband and herself and most ofwhat she said was Greek to Lady Horton."Mr. Wilding has gone to warn the Duke," she ended, and the despair ofher tone was tragical. "I sought to detain him until it should be toolate--I thought I had done so, but... but... Oh, I am afraid, Diana!""Afraid of what?" asked Diana. "Afraid of what?"And she came to Ruth and set an arm in comfort about her shoulders."Afraid that Mr. Wilding might reach the Duke in time to be destroyedwith him," her cousin answered. "Such a warning could but hasten on theblow."Lady Horton begged to be enlightened, and was filled with horrorwhen--from Diana--enlightenment was hers. Her sympathies were all withthe handsome Monmouth, for he was beautiful and should therefore betriumphant; poor Lady Horton never got beyond externals. That hernephew and Sir Rowland, whom she had esteemed, should be leagued in thisdastardly undertaking against that lovely person horrified her beyondwords. She withdrew soon afterwards, having warmly praised Ruth's actionin warning Mr. Wilding--unable to understand that it should be no partof Ruth's design to save the Duke--and went to her room to pray for thepreservation of the late King's handsome son.Left alone with her cousin, Ruth gave expression to the fears forRichard by which she was being tortured. Diana poured wine for herand urged her to drink; she sought to comfort and reassure her. Butas moments passed and grew to hours and still Richard did not appear,Ruth's fears that he had come to harm were changed to certainty. Therewas a moment when, but for Diana's remonstrances, she had gone forth inquest of news. Bad news were better than this horror of suspense. Whatif Wilding's warning should have procured help, and Richard were slainin consequence? Oh, it was unthinkable! Diana, white of face, listenedto and shared her fears. Even her shallow nature was stirred by thetragedy of Ruth's position, by dread lest Richard should indeed have methis end that night. In these moments of distress, she forgot her hopesof triumphing over Blake, of punishing him for his indifference toherself.At last, at something after midnight, there came a fevered rapping atthe outer door. Both women started up, and with arms about each other,in their sudden panic, stood there waiting for the news that must behere at last.The door of the dining-room was flung open; the women recoiled intheir dread of what might come; then Richard entered, Jasper's startledcountenance showing behind him.He closed the door, shutting out the wondering servant, and they sawthat, though his face was ashen and his limbs all a-tremble, he showedno sign of any hurt or effort. His dress was as meticulous as when lastthey had seen him. Ruth flew to him, flung her arms about his neck, andpressed him to her."Oh, Richard, Richard!" she sobbed in the immensity of her relief."Thank God! Thank God!"He wriggled peevishly in her embrace, disengaged her arms, and put herfrom him almost roughly. "Have done!" he growled, and, lurching pasther, he reached the table, took up a bottle, and brimmed himself ameasure. He gulped the wine avidly, set down the cup, and shivered."Where is Blake?" he asked."Blake?" echoed Ruth, her lips white. Diana sank into a chair,watchful, fearful and silent, taking now no glory in the thing she hadencompassed.Richard beat his hands together in a passion of dismay. "Is he nothere?" he asked, and groaned, "O God!" He flung himself all limp into achair. "You have heard the news, I see," he said."Not all of it," said Diana hoarsely, leaning forward. "Tell us whatpassed."He moistened his lips with his tongue. "We were betrayed," he said in aquivering voice. "Betrayed! Did I but know by whom..." He broke off witha bitter laugh and shrugged, rubbing his hands together and shiveringtill his shoulders shook. "Blake's party was set upon by half a companyof musketeers. Their corpses are strewn about old Newlington's orchard.Not one of them escaped. They say that Newlington himself is dead." Hepoured himself more wine.Ruth listened, her eyes burning, the rest of her as cold as ice."But...but... oh, thank God that you at least are safe, Dick!""How did you escape?" quoth Diana."How?" He started as if he had been stung. He laughed in a high, crackedvoice, his eyes wild and bloodshot. "How? Perhaps it is just as wellthat Blake has gone to his account. Perhaps..." He checked on the word,and started to his feet; Diana screamed in sheer affright. Behind herthe windows had been thrust open so violently that one of the panes wasshivered. Blake stood under the lintel, scarce recognizable, so smearedwas his face with the blood escaping from the wound his cheek had taken.His clothes were muddied, soiled, torn, and disordered.Framed there against the black background of the night, he stood andsurveyed them for a moment, his aspect terrific. Then he leapt forward,baring his sword as he came. An incoherent roar burst from his lips ashe bore straight down upon Richard."You damned, infernal traitor!" he cried. "Draw, draw! Or die like themuckworm that you are."Intrepid, her terror all vanished now that there was the need forcourage, Ruth confronted him, barring his passage, a buckler to herpalsied brother."Out of my way, mistress, or I'll be doing you a mischief.""You are mad, Sir Rowland," she told him in a voice that did somethingtowards restoring him to his senses.His fierce eyes considered her a moment, and he controlled himself tooffer an explanation. "The twenty that were with me lie stark underthe stars in Newlington's garden," he told her, as Richard had told heralready. "I escaped by a miracle, no less, but for what? Feversham willdemand of me a stern account of those lives, whilst if I am found inBridgwater there will be a short shrift for me at the rebel hands--formy share in this affair is known, my name on every lip in the town. Andwhy?" he asked with a sudden increase of fierceness. "Why? Because thatcraven villain there betrayed me.""He did not," she answered in so assured a voice that not only did itgive him pause, but caused Richard, cowering behind her, to raise hishead in wonder.Sir Rowland smiled his disbelief, and that smile, twisting hisblood-smeared countenance, was grotesque and horrible. "I left him toguard our backs and give me warning if any approached," he informed her."I knew him for too great a coward to be trusted in the fight; so I gavehim a safe task, and yet in that he failed me-failed me because he hadbetrayed and sold me.""He had not. I tell you he had not," she insisted. "I swear it."He stared at her. "There was no one else for it," he made answer, andbade her harshly stand aside.Diana, huddled together, watched and waited in horror for the end ofthese consequences of her work.Blake made a sudden movement to win past Ruth. Richard staggered to hisfeet intent on defending himself; but he was swordless; retreat to thedoor suggested itself, and he had half turned to attempt to gain it,when Ruth's next words arrested him, petrified him."There was some one else for it, Sir Rowland," she cried. "It was notRichard who betrayed you. It... it was I.""You?" The fierceness seemed all to drop away from him, whelmed in theimmensity of his astonishment. "You?" Then he laughed loud in scornfuldisbelief. "You think to save him," he said."Should I lie?" she asked him, calm and brave.He stared at her stupidly; he passed a hand across his brow, and lookedat Diana. "Oh, it is impossible!" he said at last."You shall hear," she answered, and told him how at the last moment shehad learnt not only that her husband was in Bridgwater, but that he wasto sup at Newlington's with the Duke's party."I had no thought of betraying you or of saving the Duke," she said."I knew how justifiable was what you intended. But I could not let Mr.Wilding go to his death. I sought to detain him, warning him only whenI thought it would be too late for him to warn others. But you delayedoverlong, and..."A hoarse inarticulate cry from him came to interrupt her at that point.One glimpse of his face she had and of the hand half raised with swordpointing towards her, and she closed her eyes, thinking that her sandswere run. And, indeed, Blake's intention was just then to kill her. Thathe should owe his betrayal to her was in itself cause enough toenrage him, but that her motive should have been her desire to saveWilding--Wilding of all men!--that was the last straw.Had he been forewarned that Wilding was to be one of Monmouth's party atMr. Newlington's, his pulses would have throbbed with joy, and he wouldhave flung himself into his murderous task with twice the zest he hadcarried to it. And now he learnt that not only had she thwarted hisschemes against Monmouth, but had deprived him of the ardently soughtfelicity of widowing her. He drew back his arm for the thrust;Diana huddled into her chair too horror-stricken to speak or move:Richard--immediately behind his sister--saw nothing of what was passing,and thought of nothing but his own safety.Then Blake paused, stepped back, returned his sword to its scabbard, andbending himself--but whether to bow or not was not quite plain--he tooksome paces backwards, then turned and went out by the window as he hadcome. But there was a sudden purposefulness in the way he did it thatmight have warned them this withdrawal was not quite the retreat itseemed.They watched him with many emotions, predominant among which was relief,and when he was gone Diana rose and came to Ruth."Come," she said, and sought to lead her from the room.But there was Richard now to be reckoned with, Richard from whom thepalsy was of a sudden fallen, now that the cause of it had withdrawn.He had his back to the door, and his weak mouth was pursed up into asemblance of resolution, his pale eyes looked stern, his white eyebrowsbent together in a frown."Wait," he said. They looked at him, and the shadow of a smile almostflitted across Diana's face. He stepped to the door, and, opening it,held it wide. "Go, Diana," he said. "Ruth and I must understand eachother."Diana hesitated. "You had better go, Diana," said her cousin, whereuponMistress Horton went.Hot and fierce came the recriminations from Richard's lips when he andhis sister were alone, and Ruth weathered the storm bravely until itwas stemmed again by fresh fear in Richard. For Blake had suddenlyreappeared. He came forward from his window; his manner composed andfull of resolution. Young Westmacott recoiled, the heat all frozen outof him. But Blake scarce looked at him, his smouldering glance was allfor Ruth, who watched him with incipient fear, despite herself."Madam," he said, "'tis not to be supposed a mind holding so muchthought for a husband's safety could find room for any concern as toanother's. I will ask you, natheless, to consider what tale I am to bearLord Feversham.""What tale?" said she."Aye--that will account for what has chanced; for my failure todischarge the task entrusted me, and for the slaughter of an officer ofhis and twenty men."Why ask me this?" she demanded half angrily; then suddenly bethinkingher of how she had ruined his enterprise, and of the position in whichshe had placed him, she softened. Her clear mind held justice very dear.She approached. "Oh, I am sorry--sorry, Sir Rowland," she cried.He sneered. He had wiped some of the blood from his face, but stilllooked terrible enough."Sorry!" said he, and laughed unpleasantly. "You'll come with me toFeversham and tell him what you did," said he."I?" She recoiled in fear."At once" he informed her."Wha... what's that?" faltered Richard, calling up his manhood, andcoming forward. "What are you saying, Blake?"Sir Rowland disdained to heed him. "Come, mistress," he said, andputting forward his hand he caught her wrist and pulled her roughlytowards him. She struggled to free herself, but he leered evilly uponher, no whit discomposed by her endeavours. Though short of stature,he was a man of considerable bodily strength, and she, though tall, wasslight of frame. He released her wrist, and before she realized what hewas about he had stooped, passed an arm behind her knees, another roundher waist, and, swinging her from her feet, took her up bodily in hisarms. He turned about, and a scream broke from her."Hold!" cried Richard. "Hold, you madman!""Keep off, or I'll make an end of you before I go," roared Blake overhis shoulder, for already he had turned about and was making for thewindow, apparently no more hindered by his burden than had she been adoll.Richard sprang to the door. "Jasper!" he bawled. "Jasper!" He had noweapons, as we have seen, else it may be that he had made an attempt touse them.Ruth got a hand free and caught at the windowframe as Blake was leapingthrough. It checked their progress, but did not sensibly delay it. Itwas unfortunately her wounded hand with which she had sought to cling,and with an angry, brutal wrench Sir Rowland compelled her to uncloseher grasp. He sped down the lawn towards the orchard, where his horsewas tethered. And now she knew in a subconscious sort of way why he hadearlier withdrawn. He had gone to saddle for this purpose.She struggled now, thinking that he would be too hampered to compel herto his will. He became angry, and set her down beside his horse, one armstill holding her."Look you, mistress," he told her fiercely, "living or dead, you comewith me to Feversham. Choose now."His tone was such that she never doubted he would carry out his threat.And so in dull despair she submitted, hoping that Feversham might bea gentleman and would recognize and respect a lady. Half fainting, sheallowed him to swing her to the withers of his horse. Thus they threadedtheir way in the dim starlit night through the trees towards the gate.It stood open, and they passed out into the lane. There Sir Rowland puthis horse to the trot, which he increased to a gallop when he was overthe bridge and clear of the town.CHAPTER XXI. THE SENTENCEMr. Wilding, as we know, was to remain at Bridgwater for the purpose ofcollecting from Mr. Newlington the fine which had been imposed upon him.It is by no means clear whether Monmouth realized the fullness ofthe tragedy at the merchant's house, and whether he understood that,stricken with apoplexy at the thought of parting with so considerable aportion of his fortune, Mr. Newlington had not merely fainted, but hadexpired under His Grace's eyes. If he did realize it he was cynicallyindifferent, and lest we should be doing him an injustice by assumingthis we had better give him the benefit of the doubt, and take it thatin the subsequent bustle of departure, his mind filled with the prospectof the night attack to be delivered upon his uncle's army at-Sedgemoor,he thought no more either of Mr. Newlington or of Mr. Wilding. Thelatter, as we know, had no place in the rebel army; although a man ofhis hands, he was not a trained soldier, and notwithstanding that he mayfully have intended to draw his sword for Monmouth when the time came,yet circumstances had led to his continuing after Monmouth's landing themore diplomatic work of movement-man, in which he had been engaged forthe months that had preceded it.So it befell that when Monmouth's army marched out of Bridgwater ateleven o'clock on that Sunday night, not to make for Gloucester andCheshire, as was generally believed, but to fall upon the encampedFeversham at Sedgemoor and slaughter the royal army in their beds, Mr.Wilding was left behind. Trenchard was gone, in command of his troop ofhorse, and Mr. Wilding had for only company his thoughts touching thesingular happenings of that busy night.He went back to the sign of The Ship overlooking the Cross, and, kickingoff his sodden shoes, he supped quietly in the room of which shattereddoor and broken window reminded him of his odd interview with Ruth, andof the comedy of love she had enacted to detain him there. Thethought of it embittered him; the part she had played seemed to hisretrospective mind almost a wanton's part--for all that in name she washis wife. And yet, underlying a certain irrepressible nausea, came thereflection that, after all, her purpose had been to save his life. Itwould have been a sweet thought, sweet enough to have overlaid thatother bitterness, had he not insisted upon setting it down entirely toher gratitude and her sense of justice. She intended to repay the debtin which she had stood to him since, at the risk of his own lifeand fortune, he had rescued her brother from the clutches of theLord-Lieutenant at Taunton.He sighed heavily as he thought of the results that had attended hiscompulsory wedding of her. In the intensity of his passion, inthe blindness of his vanity, which made him confident--gloriouslyconfident--that did he make himself her husband, she herself would makeof him her lover before long, he had committed an unworthiness of whichit seemed he might never cleanse himself in life. There was but oneamend, as he had told her. Let him make it, and perhaps she would--outof gratitude, if out of no other feeling--come to think more kindlyof him; and that night it seemed to him as he sat alone in that meanchamber that it were a better and a sweeter thing to earn some measureof her esteem by death than to continue in a life that inspired herhatred and resentment. From which it will be seen how utterly hedisbelieved the protestations she had uttered in seeking to detain him.They were--he was assured--a part of a scheme, a trick, to lull himwhile Monmouth and his officers were being butchered. And she had gonethe length of saying she loved him! He regretted that, being as he wasconvinced of its untruth. What cause had she to love him? She hated him,and because she hated him she did not scruple to lie to him--once withsuggestions and this time with actual expression of affection--that shemight gain her ends: ends that concerned her brother and Sir RowlandBlake. Sir Rowland Blake! The name was a very goad to his passion anddespair.He rose from the table and took a turn in the room, moving noiselesslyin his stockinged feet. He felt the need of air and action; theweariness of his flesh incurred in his long ride from London was castoff or forgotten. He must go forth. He picked up his fine shoes ofSpanish leather, but as luck would have it--little though he guessed theextent just then--he found them hardening, though still damp from thedews of Mr. Newlington's garden. He cast them aside, and, taking a keyfrom his pocket, unlocked an oak cupboard and withdrew the heavy muddyboots in which he had ridden from town. He drew them on and, takingup his hat and sword, went down the creaking stairs and out into thestreet.Bridgwater had fallen quiet by now; the army was gone and townsfolk werein their beds. Moodily, unconsciously, yet as if guided by a sort ofinstinct, he went down the High Street, and then turned off into thenarrower lane that led in the direction of Lupton House. By the gatesof this he paused, recalled out of his abstraction and rendered awareof whither his steps had led him by the sight of the hall door standingopen, a black figure silhouetted against the light behind it. What washappening here? Why were they not abed like all decent folk?The figure called to him in a quavering voice. "Mr. Wilding! Mr.Wilding!" for the light beating upon his face and figure from theopen door had revealed him. The form came swiftly forward, its stepspattering down the walk, another slenderer figure surged in its placeupon the threshold, hovered there an instant, then plunged down into thedarkness to come after it. But the first was by now upon Mr. Wilding."What is it, Jasper?" he asked, recognizing the old servant."Mistress Ruth!" wailed the fellow, wringing his hands. "She... she hasbeen... carried off." He got it out in gasps, winded by his short runand by the excitement that possessed him.No word said Wilding. He just stood and stared, scarcely understanding,and in that moment they were joined by Richard. He seized Wilding by thearm. "Blake has carried her off," he cried."Blake?" said Mr. Wilding, and wondered with a sensation of nausea wasit an ordinary running away. But Richard's next words made it plain tohim that it was no amorous elopement, nor even amorous abduction."He has carried her to Feversham... for her betrayal of his to-night'splan to seize the Duke."That stirred Mr. Wilding. He wasted no time in idle questions or idlercomplainings. "How long since?" he asked, and it was he who clutchedRichard now, by the shoulder and with a hand that hurt."Not ten minutes ago," was the quavering answer."And you were at hand when it befell?" cried Wilding, the scorn in hisvoice rising superior to his agitation and fears for Ruth. "You were athand, and could neither prevent nor follow him?""I'll go with you now, if you'll give chase," whimpered Richard, feelinghimself for once the craven that he was."If?" echoed Wilding scornfully, and dragged him past the gate and uptowards the house even as he spoke. "Is there room for a doubt of it?Have you horses, at least?""To spare," said Richard as they hurried on. They skirted the house andfound the stable door open as Blake had left it. Old Jasper followedwith a lamp which burned steadily, so calm was the air of that Julynight. In three minutes they had saddled a couple of nags; in five theywere riding for the bridge and the road to Weston Zoyland."It is a miracle you remained in Bridgwater," said Richard as they rode."How came you to be left behind?""I had a task assigned me in the town against the Duke's returnto-morrow," Wilding explained, and he spoke almost mechanically, hismind full of--anguished by--thoughts of Ruth."Against the Duke's return?" cried Richard, first surprised and thenthinking that Wilding spoke at random. "Against the Duke's return?" herepeated."That is what I said?""But the Duke is marching to Gloucester.""The Duke is marching by circuitous ways to Sedgemoor," answeredWilding, never dreaming that at this time of day there could be theslightest imprudence in saying so much, indeed, taking little heed ofwhat he said, his mind obsessed by the other, to him, far weightiermatter."To Sedgemoor?" gasped Westmacott."Aye--to take Feversham by surprise--to destroy King James's soldiers intheir beds. He should be near upon the attack by now. But there! Spur onand save your breath if we are to overtake Sir Rowland."They pounded on through the night at a breakneck pace which they neverslackened until, when within a quarter of a mile or so of Penzoy Pound,where the army was encamped and slumbering by now, they caught sight ofthe musketeers' matches glowing in the dark ahead of them. An outpostbarred their progress; but Richard had the watchword, and he spurredahead shouting "Albemarle," and the soldiers fell back and gave thempassage. On they galloped, skirting Penzoy Pound and the army sleepingin utter unconsciousness of the fate that was creeping stealthily uponit out of the darkness and mists across the moors; they clattered onpast Langmoor Stone and dashed straight into the village, Richard neverdrawing rein until he reached the door of the cottage where Fevershamwas lodged.They had come not only at a headlong pace, but in a headlong manner,without quite considering what awaited them at the end of their ride inaddition to their object of finding Ruth. It was only now, as he drewrein before the lighted house and caught the sound of Blake's raisedvoice pouring through an open window on the ground floor, that Richardfully realized what manner of rashness he was committing. He was toolate to rescue Ruth from Blake. What more could he look to achieve?His hope had been that with Wilding's help he might snatch her from SirRowland before the latter reached his destination. But now--to enterFeversham's presence and in association with so notorious a rebel as Mr.Wilding were a piece of folly of the heroic kind that Richard did notsavour. Indeed, had it not been for Wilding's masterful presence, it ismore than odds he had turned tail, and ridden home again to bed.But Wilding, who had leapt nimbly to the ground, stood waiting forRichard to dismount, impatient now that from the sound of Sir Rowland'svoice he had assurance that Richard had proved an able guide. The youngman got down, but might yet have hesitated had not Wilding caught himby the arm and whirled him up the steps, through the open door, pastthe two soldiers who kept it, and who were too surprised to stay him,straight into the long, low-ceilinged chamber where Feversham, attendedby a captain of horse, was listening to Blake's angry narrative of thatnight's failure.Mr. Wilding's entrance was decidedly sensational. He stepped quicklyforward, and, taking Blake who was still talking, all unconscious ofthose behind him, by the collar of his coat, he interrupted him in themiddle of an impassioned period, wrenched him backwards off his feet,and dashed him with a force almost incredible into a heap in a corner ofthe room. There for some moments the baronet lay half dazed by the shockof his fall.A long table, which seemed to divide the chamber in two, stood betweenLord Feversham and his officer and Mr. Wilding and Ruth--by whose sidehe had now come to stand in Blake's room.There was an exclamation, half anger, half amazement, at Mr. Wilding'soutrage upon Sir Rowland, and the captain of horse sprang forward.But Wilding raised his hand, his face so composed and calm that it wasimpossible to think him conceiving any violence, as indeed he protestedat that moment."Be assured, gentlemen," he said, "that I have no further rudeness tooffer any so that this lady is suffered to withdraw with me." And hetook in his own a hand that Ruth, amazed and unresisting, yielded up tohim. That touch of his seemed to drive out her fears and to restore herconfidence; the mortal terror in which she had been until his comingdropped from her now. She was no longer alone and abandoned to thevindictiveness of rude and violent men. She had beside her one in whomexperience had taught her to have faith.Louis Duras, Marquis de Blanquefort, and Earl of Feversham, coughed withmock discreetness under cover of his hand. "Ahem!"He was a comely man with a long nose, good low-lidded eyes, a humorousmouth, and a weak chin; at a glance he looked what he was, a weak,good-natured sensualist. He was resplendent at the moment in a bluesatin dressing-gown stiff with gold lace, for he had been interruptedby Blake's arrival in the very act of putting himself to bed, and hishead--divested of his wig--was bound up in a scarf of many colours.At his side, the red-coated captain, arrested by the general's sardoniccough, stood, a red-faced, freckled boy, looking to his superior fororders."I t'ink you 'ave 'urt Sare Rowland," said Feversham composedly in hisbad English. "Who are you, sare?""This lady's husband," answered Wilding, whereupon the captain staredand Feversham's brows went up in surprised amusement."So-ho! T'at true?" quoth the latter in a tone suggesting that itexplained everything to him. "T'is gif a differen' colour to yourstory, Sare Rowlan'." Then he added in a chuckle, "Ho, ho--l'amour!" andlaughed outright.Blake, gathering together his wits and his limbs at the same time, madeshift to rise."What a plague does their relationship matter?" he began. He would haveadded more, but the Frenchman thought this question one that neededanswering."Parbleu!" he swore, his amusement rising. "It seem to mattersomet'ing.""Damn me!" swore Blake, red in the face from pale that he had been. "Doyou conceive that if I had run away with his wife for her own sake Ihad fetched her to you?" He lurched forward as he spoke, but kept hisdistance from Wilding, who stood between Ruth and him.Feversham bowed sardonically. "You are a such flatterer, Sare Rowlan',"said he, laughter bubbling in his words.Blake looked his scorn of this trivial Frenchman, who, upon scentingwhat appeared to be the comedy of an outraged husband overtaking theman who had carried off his wife, forgot the serious business, a partof which Sir Rowland had already imparted to him. Captain Wentworth--atime-serving gentleman--smiled with this French general of a Britisharmy that he might win the great man's favour."I have told your lordship," said Blake, froth on his lips, "thatthe twenty men I had from you, as well as Ensign Norris, are dead inBridgwater, and that my plan to carry off King Monmouth has come toruin, all because we were betrayed by this woman. It is now my furtherprivilege to point out to your lordship the man to whom she sold us."Feversham misliked Sir Rowland's arrogant tone, misliked his angry,scornful glance. His eyes narrowed, the laughter faded slowly from hisface."Yes, yes, I remember," said he; "t'is lady, you have tole us, betrayyou. Ver' well. But you have not tole us who betray you to t'is lady."And he looked inquiringly at Blake.The baronet's jaw dropped; his face lost some of its high colour. Hewas stunned by the question as the bird is stunned that flies headlongagainst a pane of glass. He had crashed into an obstruction sotransparent that he had not seen it."So!" said Feversham, and he stroked the cleft of his chin. "CaptainWentwort', be so kind as to call t'e guard."Wentworth moved to obey, but before he had gone round the table, Blakehad looked behind him and espied Richard shrinking by the door."By heaven!" he cried, "I can more than answer your lordship'squestion."Wentworth stopped, looking at Feversham."Voyons," said the General."I can place you in possession of the man who has wrought our ruin. Heis there," and he pointed theatrically to Richard.Feversham looked at the limp figure in some bewilderment. Indeed, he washaving a most bewildering evening--or morning, rather, for it was eventhen on the stroke of one o'clock. "An' who are you, sare?" he asked.Richard came forward, nerving himself for what was to follow. It hadjust occurred to him that he held a card which should trump any trick ofSir Rowland's vindictiveness, and the prospect heartened and comfortedhim."I am this lady's brother, my lord," he answered, and his voice wasfairly steady."Tiens!" said Feversham, and, smiling, he turned to Wentworth."Quite a family party, sir," said the captain, smiling back."Oh! mais tout--fait," said the General, laughing outright, and thenWilding created a diversion by leading Ruth to a chair that stood at thefar end of the table, and drawing it forward for her. "Ah, yes," saidFeversham airily, "let Madame sit.""You are very good, sir," said Ruth, her voice brave and calm."But somewhat lacking in spontaneity," Wilding criticized, which setWentworth staring and the Frenchman scowling."Shall I call the guard, my lord?" asked Wentworth crisply."I t'ink yes," said Feversham, and the captain gained the door, andspoke a word to one of the soldiers without."But, my lord," exclaimed Blake in a tone of protest, "I vow you are tooready to take this fellow's word.""He 'as spoke so few," said Feversham."Do you know who he is?""You 'af 'eard 'im say--t'e lady's 'usband.""Aye--but his name," cried Blake, quivering with anger. "Do you knowthat it is Wilding?"The name certainly made an impression that might have flattered the manto whom it belonged. Feversham's whole manner changed; the trivial airof persiflage that he had adopted hitherto was gone on the instant, andhis brow grew dark."T'at true?" he asked sharply. "Are you Mistaire Wildin'--MistaireAntoine Wildin'?""Your lordship's most devoted servant," said Wilding suavely, and made aleg.Wentworth in the background paused in the act of reclosing the door tostare at this gentleman whose name Albemarle had rendered so excellentlywell known."And you to dare come 'ere?" thundered Feversham, thoroughly rousedby the other's airy indifference. "You to dare come 'ere--into my ver'presence?"Mr. Wilding smiled conciliatingly. "I came for my wife, my lord," hereminded him. "It grieves me to intrude upon your lordship at so late anhour, and indeed it was far from my intent. I had hoped to overtake SirRowland before he reached you.""Nom de Dieu!" swore Feversham. "Ho! A so great effrontery!" He swunground upon Blake again. "Sare Rowlan'," he bade him angrily, "be so kindto tell me what 'appen in Breechwater--everyt'ing!"Blake, his face purple, seemed to struggle for breath and words. Mr.Wilding answered for him."Sir Rowland is so choleric, my lord," he said in his pleasant, levelvoice, "that perhaps the tale would come more intelligibly fromme. Believe me that he has served you to the best of his ability.Unfortunately for the success of your choice plan of murder, I had newsof it at the eleventh hour, and with a party of musketeers I was ableto surprise and destroy your cut-throats in Mr. Newlington's garden.You see, my lord, I was to have been one of the victims myself, and Iresented the attentions that were intended me. I had no knowledge thatSir Rowland had contrived to escape, and, frankly, it is a thing Ideplore more than I can say, for had that not happened much troublemight have been saved and your lordship's rest had not been disturbed.""But t'e woman?" cried Feversham impatiently. "How is she come into thisgalare?""It was she who warned him," Blake got out, "as already I have had thehonour to inform your lordship.""And your lordship cannot blame her for that," said Wilding. "The ladyis a most loyal subject of King James; but she is also, as you observe,a dutiful wife. I will add that it was her intention to warn me onlywhen too late for interference. Sir Rowland, as it happened, was slowin...""Silence!" blazed the Frenchman. "Now t'at I know who you are, t'at makea so great difference. Where is t'e guard, Wentwort'?""I hear them," answered the captain, and from the street came the trampof their marching feet.Feversham turned again to Blake. "T'e affaire 'as 'appen' so," hesaid, between question and assertion, summing up the situation as heunderstood it. "T'is rogue," and he pointed to Richard, "'ave betrayyour plan to 'is sister, who betray it to 'er 'usband, who save t'e Ducde Monmoot'. N'est-ce pas?""That is so," said Blake, and Ruth scarcely thought it worth while toadd that she had heard of the plot not only from her brother, but fromBlake as well. After all, Blake's attitude in the matter, his action inbringing her to Feversham for punishment, and to exculpate himself, mustsuffice to cause any such statement of hers to be lightly received bythe General.She sat in an anguished silence, her eyes wide, her face pale, andwaited for the end of this strange business. In her heart she did permitherself to think that it would be difficult to assemble a group ofmen less worthy of respect. Choleric and vindictive Blake, foolishFeversham, stupid Wentworth, and timid Richard--even Richard didnot escape the unfavourable criticism they were undergoing in hersubconscious mind. Only Wilding detached in that assembly--as he haddetached in another that she remembered--and stood out in sharp relief avery man, calm, intrepid, self-possessed; and if she was afraid, she wasmore afraid for him than for herself. This was something that, perhaps,she scarcely realized just then; but she was to realize it soon.Feversham was speaking again, asking Blake a fresh question. "And whobetray you to t'is rogue?""To Westmacott?" cried Blake. "He was in the plot with me. He was leftto guard the rear, to see that we were not taken by surprise, and hedeserted his post. Had he not done that, there had been no disaster, inspite of Mr. Wilding's intervention."Feversham's brow was dark, his eyes glittered as they rested on thetraitor."T'at true, sare?" he asked him."Not quite," put in Mr. Wilding. "Mr. Westmacott, I think, wasconstrained away. He did not intend...""Tais-toi!" blazed Feversham. "Did I interrogate you? It is for MistaireWestercott to answer." He set a hand on the table and leaned forwardtowards Wilding, his face very malign. "You shall to answer foryourself, Mistaire Wildin'; I promise you you shall to answer foryourself." He turned again to Richard. "Eh, bien?" he snapped. "Will youspeak?"Richard came forward a step; he was certainly nervous, and certainlypale; but neither as pale nor as nervous as from our knowledge ofRichard we might have looked to see him at that moment."It is in a measure true," he said. "But what Mr. Wilding has said ismore exact. I was induced away. I did not dream any could know of theplan, or that my absence could cause this catastrophe.""So you went, eh, vaurien? You t'ought t'at be to do your duty, eh? Andit was you who tole your sistaire?""I may have told her, but not before she had the tale already fromBlake."Feversham sneered and shrugged. "Natural you will not speak true. Atraitor I 'ave observe' is always liar."Richard drew himself up; he seemed invested almost with a new dignity."Your lordship is pleased to account me a traitor?" he inquired."A dam' traitor," said his lordship, and at that moment the door opened,and a sergeant, with six men following him, stood at the salute upon thethreshold. "A la bonne heure!" his lordship hailed them. "Sergean', youwill arrest t'is rogue and t'is lady,"--he waved his hand from Richardto Ruth--"and you will take t'em to lock..up."The sergeant advanced towards Richard, who drew a step away from him.Ruth rose to her feet in agitation. Mr. Wilding interposed himselfbetween her and the guard, his hand upon his sword."My lord," he cried, "do they teach no better courtesy in France?"Feversham scowled at him, smiling darkly. "I shall talk wit' you soon,sare," said he, his words a threat."But, my lord..." began Richard. "I can make it very plain I am notraitor...""In t'e mornin'," said Feversham blandly, waving his hand, and thesergeant took Richard by the shoulder.But Richard twisted from his grasp. "In the morning will be too late,"he cried. "I have it in my power to render you such a service as youlittle dream of.""Take 'im away," said Feversham wearily."I can save you from destruction," bawled Richard, "you and your army."Perhaps even now Feversham had not heeded him but for Wilding's suddeninterference."Silence, Richard!" he cried to him. "Would you betray...?" He checkedon the word; more he dared not say; but he hoped faintly that he hadsaid enough.Feversham, however, chanced to observe that this man who had shownhimself hitherto so calm looked suddenly most singularly perturbed."Eh?" quoth the General. "An instan', Sergean'. What is t'is, eh?"--andhe looked from Wilding to Richard."Your lordship shall learn at a price," cried Richard."Me, I not bargain wit' traitors," said his lordship stiffly."Very well, then," answered Richard, and he folded his armsdramatically. "But no matter what your lordship's life may be hereafter,you will never regret anything more bitterly than you shall regret thisby sunrise if indeed you live to see it."Feversham shifted uneasily on his feet. "'What you say?" he asked. "Whatyou mean?""You shall know at a price," said Richard again.Wilding, realizing the hopelessness of interfering now, stood gloomilyapart, a great bitterness in his soul at the indiscretion he hadcommitted in telling Richard of the night attack that was afoot."Your lordship shall hear my price, but you need not pay it me until youhave had an opportunity of verifying the information I have to give you."Tell me," said Feversham after a brief pause, during which hescrutinized the young man's face."If your lordship will promise liberty and safe-conduct to my sister andmyself.""Tell me," Feversham repeated."When you have promised to grant me what I ask in return for myinformation.""Yes, if I t'ink your information is wort'""I am content," said Richard. He inclined his head and loosed thequarrel of his news. "Your camp is slumbering, your officers are allabed with the exception of the outpost on the road to Bridgwater. Whatshould you say if I told you that Monmouth and all his army are marchingupon you at this very moment, will probably fall upon you before anotherhour is past?"Wilding uttered a groan, and his hands fell to his sides. Had Fevershamobserved this he might have been less ready with his sneering answer."A lie!" he answered, and laughed. "My fren', I 'ave myself beento-night, at midnight, on t'e moore, and I 'ave 'eard t'e army of t'eDuc de Monmoot' marching to Bristol on t'e road--what you call t'e road,Wentwort'?""The Eastern Causeway, my lord," answered the captain."Voil!" said Feversham, and spread his hands. "What you say now, eh?""That that is part of Monmouth's plan to come at you across the moors,by way of Chedzoy, avoiding your only outpost, and falling upon you inyour beds, all unawares. Lord! sir, do not take my word for it. Send outyour scouts, and I dare swear they'll not need go far before they comeupon the enemy."Feversham looked at Wentworth. His lordship's face had undergone achange."What you t'ink?" he asked."Indeed, my lord, it sounds so likely," answered Wentworth, "that...that... I marvel we did not provide against such a contingency.""But I 'ave provide'!" cried this nephew of the great Turenne."Ogelt'orpe is on t'e moor and Sare Francis Compton. If t'is is true,'ow can t'ey 'ave miss Monmoot'? Send word to Milor' Churchill at once,Wentwort'. Let t'e matter be investigate'--at once, Wentwort'--at once!"The General was dancing with excitement. Wentworth saluted and turned toleave the room. "If you 'ave tole me true," continued Feversham, turningnow to Richard, "you shall 'ave t'e price you ask, and t'e t'anks of t'eKing's army. But if not...""Oh, it's true enough," broke in Wilding, and his voice was like agroan, his face over-charged with gloom.Feversham looked at him; his sneering smile returned."Me, I not remember," said he, "that Mr. Westercott 'ave include you int'e bargain."Nothing had been further from Wilding's thoughts than such a suggestion.And he snorted his disdain. The sergeant had fallen back at Feversham'swords, and his men lined the wall of the chamber. The General badeRichard be seated whilst he waited. Sir Rowland stood apart, leaningwearily against the wainscot, waiting also, his dull wits not quiteclear how Richard might have come by so valuable a piece of information,his evil spirit almost wishing it untrue, in his vindictiveness, to theend that Richard might pay the price of having played him false and Ruththe price of having scorned him.Feversham meanwhile was seeking--with no great success--to engageMr. Wilding in talk of Monmouth, against whom Feversham harboured inaddition to his political enmity a very deadly personal hatred; forFeversham had been a suitor to the hand of the Lady Henrietta Wentworth,the woman for whom Monmouth--worthy son of his father--had practicallyabandoned his own wife; the woman with whom he had run off, to the greatscandal of court and nation.Despairing of drawing any useful information from Wilding, his lordshipwas on the point of turning to Blake, when quick steps and the rattle ofa scabbard sounded without; the door was thrust open without ceremony,and Captain Wentworth reappeared."My lord," he cried, his manner excited beyond aught one could havebelieved possible in so phlegmatic-seeming a person, "it is true. We arebeset.""Beset!" echoed Feversham. "Beset already?""We can hear them moving on the moor. They are crossing the LangmoorRhine. They will be upon us in ten minutes at the most. I have rousedColonel Douglas, and Dunbarton's regiment is ready for them."Feversham exploded. "What else 'ave you done?" he asked. "Where isMilor' Churchill?""Lord Churchill is mustering his men as quietly as may be that they maybe ready to surprise those who come to surprise us. By Heaven, sir, weowe a great debt to Mr. Westmacott. Without his information we mighthave had all our throats cut whilst we slept.""Be so kind to call Belmont," said Feversham. "Tell him to bring myclot'es."Wentworth turned and went out again to execute the General's orders.Feversham spoke to Richard. "We are oblige', Mr. Westercott," said he."We are ver' much oblige'."Suddenly from a little distance came the roll of drums. Other soundsbegan to stir in the night outside to tell of a waking army.Feversham stood listening. "It is Dunbarton's," he murmured. Then, withsome show of heat, "Ah, pardieu!" he cried. "But it was a dirty t'ingt'is Monmoot' 'ave prepare'. It is murder; it is not t'e war."And yet," said Wilding critically, "it is a little more like war thanthe Bridgwater affair to which your lordship gave your sanction."Feversham pursed his lips and considered the speaker. Wentworthreentered, followed by the Earl's valet carrying an armful of garments.His lordship threw off his dressing-gown and stood forth in shirt andbreeches."Mais duche-toi, donc, Belmont!" said he. "Nous nous battons! Ii fautque je m'habille." Belmont, a little wizened fellow who understoodnothing of this topsy-turveydom, hastened forward, deposited his armfulon the table, and selected a finely embroidered waistcoat, which heproceeded to hold for his master. Wriggling into it, Feversham rappedout his orders."Captain Wentwort', you will go to your regimen at once. But first,ah--wait. Take t'ose six men and Mistaire Wilding. 'Ave 'im shot atonce; you onderstan', eh? Good. Allons, Belmont! my cravat."CHAPTER XXII. THE EXECUTIONCaptain Wentworth clicked his heels together and saluted. Blake, in thebackground, drew a deep breath--unmistakably of satisfaction, and hiseyes glittered. A muffled cry broke from Ruth, who rose instantly fromher chair, her hand on her bosom. Richard stood with fallen jaw, amazed,a trifle troubled even, whilst Mr. Wilding started more in surprise thanactual fear, and approached the table."You heard, sir," said Captain Wentworth."I heard," answered Mr. Wilding quietly. "But surely not aright. Onemoment, sir," and he waved his hand so compellingly that, despite theorder he had received, the phlegmatic captain hesitated.Feversham, who had taken the cravat--a yard of priceless Dutchlace--from the hands of his valet, and was standing with his back to thecompany at a small and very faulty mirror that hung by the overmantel,looked peevishly over his shoulder."My lord," said Wilding, and Blake, for all his hatred of this man,marvelled at a composure that did not forsake him even now, "you aresurely not proposing to deal with me in this fashion--not seriously, mylord?""Ah, ca!" said the Frenchman. "T'ink it a jest if you please. What foryou come 'ere?""Assuredly not for the purpose of being shot," said Wilding, andactually smiled. Then, in the tones of one discussing a matter that isgrave but not of surpassing gravity, he continued: "It is not that Ifail to recognize that I may seem to have incurred the rigour of thelaw; but these matters must be formally proved against me. I haveaffairs to set in order against such a consummation.""Ta, ta!" snapped Feversham. "T'at not regard me Weutwort', you 'ave'eard my order." And he returned to his mirror and the nice adjustmentof his neckwear."But, my lord," insisted Wilding, "you have not the right--you have notthe power so to proceed against me. A man of my quality is not to beshot without a trial.""You can 'ang if you prefer," said Feversham indifferently, drawing outthe ends of his cravat and smoothing them down upon his breast. He facedabout briskly. "Give me t'at coat, Belmont. His Majesty 'ave empower meto 'ang or shoot any gentlemens of t'e partie of t'e Duc t'e Monmoot' ont'e spot. I say t'at for your satisfaction. And look, I am desolate' tobe so quick wit' you, but please to consider t'e circumstance. T'e enemygo to attack. Wentwort' must go to his regimen', and my ot'erofficers are all occupi'. You comprehen' I 'ave not t'e time to spareyou--n'est-ce-pas?"--Wentworth's hand touched Wilding on the shoulder.He was standing with head slightly bowed, his brows knit in thought. Helooked round at the touch, sighed and smiled.Belmont held the coat for his master, who slipped into it, and flungat Wilding what was intended for a consolatory sop. "It is fortune deguerre, Mistaire Wilding. I am desolate'; but it is fortune of t'e war.""May it be less fortunate for your lordship, then," said Wilding dryly,and was on the point of turning, when Ruth's voice came in a loud cry tostartle him and to quicken his pulses."My lord!" It was a cry of utter anguish.Feversham, settling his gold-laced coat comfortably to his figure,looked at her. "Madame?" said he.But she had nothing to say. She stood, deathly white, slightly bentforward, one hand wringing the other, her eyes almost wild, her bosomheaving frantically."Hum!" said Feversham, and he loosened and removed the scarf from hishead. He shrugged slightly and looked at Wentworth. "Finissons!" saidhe.The word and the look snapped the trammels that bound Ruth's speech."Five minutes, my lord!" she cried imploringly. "Give him fiveminutes--and me, my lord!"Wilding, deeply shaken, trembled now as he awaited Feversham's reply.The Frenchman seemed to waver. "Bien," he began, spreading his hands.And in that moment a shot rang out in the night and startled the wholecompany. Feversham threw back his head; the signs of yielding left hisface. "Ha!" he cried. "T'ey are arrive." He snatched his wig from hislacquey's hands, donned it, and turned again an instant to the mirrorto adjust the great curls. "Quick, Wentwort'! T'ere is no more time now.Make Mistaire Wilding be shot at once. T'en to your regimen'." He facedabout and took the sword his valet proffered. "Au revoir, messieurs!""Serviteur, madame!" And, buckling his sword-belt as he went, he sweptout, leaving the door wide open, Belmont following, Wentworth salutingand the guards presenting arms."Come, sir," said the captain in a subdued voice, his eyes avoidingRuth's face."I am ready," answered Wilding firmly, and he turned to glance at hiswife.She was bending towards him, her hands held out, such a look on her faceas almost drove him mad with despair, reading it as he did. He made asound deep in his throat before he found words."Give me one minute, sir--one minute," he begged Wentworth. "I ask nomore than that."Wentworth was a gentleman and not ill-natured. But he was a soldier andhad received his orders. He hesitated between the instincts of thetwo conditions. And what time he did so there came a clatter of hoofswithout to resolve him. It was Feversham departing."You shall have your minute, sir," said he. "More I dare not give you,as you can see."From my heart I thank you," answered Mr. Wilding, and from thegratitude of his tone you might have inferred that it was his lifeWentworth had accorded him.The captain had already turned aside to address his men. "Two of yououtside, guard that window," he ordered. "The rest of you, in thepassage. Bestir there!""Take your precautions, by all means, sir," said Wilding; "but I giveyou my word of honour I shall attempt no escape."Wentworth nodded without replying. His eye lighted on Blake--who hadbeen seemingly forgotten in the confusion--and on Richard. A kindlinessfor the man who met his end so unflinchingly, a respect for so worthy anenemy, actuated the red-faced captain."You had better take yourself off, Sir Rowland," said he. "And you, Mr.Westmacott--you can wait in the passage with my men."They obeyed him promptly enough, but when outside Sir Rowland madebold to remind the captain that he was failing in his duty, and thathe should make a point of informing the General of this anon. Wentworthbade him go to the devil, and so was rid of him.Alone, inside that low-ceilinged chamber, stood Ruth and Wilding faceto face. He advanced towards her, and with a shuddering sob she flungherself into his arms. Still, he mistrusted the emotion to which shewas a prey--dreading lest it should have its root in pity. He patted hershoulder soothingly."Nay, nay, little child," he whispered in her ear. "Never weep forme that have not a tear for myself. What better resolution of thedifficulties my folly has created?" For only answer she clung closer,her hands locked about his neck, her slender body shaken by her silentweeping. "Don't pity me," he besought her. "I am content it should beso. It is the amend I promised you. Waste no pity on me, Ruth."She raised her face, her eyes wild and blurred with tears, looked up tohis."It is not pity!" she cried. "I want you, Anthony! I love you, Anthony,Anthony!"His face grew ashen. "It is true, then!" he asked her. "And what yousaid to-night was true! I thought you said it only to detain me.""Oh, it is true, it is true!" she wailed.He sighed; he disengaged a hand to stroke her face. "I am happy," hesaid, and strove to smile. "Had I lived, who knows...?""No, no, no," she interrupted him passionately, her arms tighteningabout his neck. He bent his head. Their lips met and clung. A knockfell upon the door. They started, and Wilding raised his hands gently todisengage her pinioning arms."I must go, sweet," he said."God help me!" she moaned, and clung to him still. "It is I who amkilling you--I and your love for me. For it was to save me you rodehither to-night, never pausing to weigh your own deadly danger. Oh, Iam punished for having listened to every voice but the voice of my ownheart where you were concerned. Had I loved you earlier--had I owned itearlier...""It had still been too late," he said, more to comfort her than becausehe knew it to be so. "Be brave for my sake, Ruth. You can be brave, Iknow--so well. Listen, sweet. Your words have made me happy. Mar notthis happiness of mine by sending me out in grief at your grief."Her response to his prayer was brave, indeed. Through her tears came afaint smile to overspread her face so white and pitiful."We shall meet soon again," she said."Aye--think on that," he bade her, and pressed her to him. "Good-bye,sweet! God keep you till we meet!" he added, his voice infinitelytender."Mr. Wilding!" Wentworth's voice called him, and the captain thrust thedoor open a foot or so. "Mr. Wilding!""I am coming," he answered steadily. He kissed her again, and on thatkiss of his she sank against him, and he felt her turn all limp. Heraised his voice. "Richard!" he shouted wildly. "Richard!"At the note of alarm in his voice, Wentworth flung wide the doorand entered, Richard's ashen face showing over his shoulder. In herbrother's care Wilding delivered his mercifully unconscious wife. "Seeto her, Dick," he said, and turned to go, mistrusting himself now.But he paused as he reached the door, Wentworth waxing more and moreimpatient at his elbow. He turned again."Dick," he said, "we might have been better friends. I would we hadbeen. Let us part so at least," and he held out his hand, smiling.Before so much gallantry Richard was conquered almost to the point ofworship; a weak man himself, there was no virtue he could more admirethan strength. He left Ruth in the high-backed chair in which Wilding'stender hands had placed her, and sprang forward, tears in his eyes. Hewrung Wilding's hands in wordless passion."Be good to her, Dick," said Wilding, and went out with Wentworth.He was marched down the street in the centre of that small party ofmusketeers of Dunbarton's regiment, his thoughts all behind him ratherthan ahead, a smile on his lips. He had conquered at the last. Hethought of that other parting of theirs, nearly a month ago, on the roadby Walford. Now, as then, circumstance was the fire that had melted her.But the crucible was no longer--as then of pity; it was the crucible oflove.And in that same crucible, too, Anthony Wilding's nature had undergone atransmutation; his love for Ruth had been purified of that base alloy ofdesire which had driven him into the unworthiness of making her his ownat all costs; there was no carnal grossness in his present passion; itwas pure as a religion--the love that takes no account of self, the lovethat makes for joyous and grateful martyrdom. And a joyous and gratefulmartyr would Anthony Wilding have been could he have thought that hisdeath would bring her happiness or peace. In such a faith as that he hadmarched--or so he thought blithely to his end, and the smile on his lipshad been less wistful than it was. Thinking of the agony in which he hadleft her, he almost came to wish--so pure was his love grown--that hehad not conquered. The joy that at first was his was now all dashed. Hisdeath would cause her pain. His death! O God! It is an easy thing to bea martyr; but this was not martyrdom; having done what he had done hehad not the right to die. The last vestige of the smile that he had wornfaded from his tight-pressed lips, tight-pressed as though to enduresome physical suffering. His face greyed, and deep lines furrowedhis brow. Thus he marched on, mechanically, amid his marching escort,through the murky, fog-laden night, taking no heed of the stir aboutthem, for all Weston Zoyland was aroused by now.Ahead of them, and over to the east, the firing blazed and crackled,volley upon volley, to tell them that already battle had been joinedin earnest. Monmouth's surprise had aborted, and it passed throughWilding's mind that to a great extent he was to blame for this. But itgave him little care.At least his indiscretion had served the purpose of rescuing Ruth fromLord Feversham's unclean clutches. For the rest, knowing that Monmouth'sarmy by far outnumbered Feversham's, he had no doubt that the advantagemust still lie with the Duke, in spite of Feversham's having been warnedin the eleventh hour.Louder grew the sounds of battle. Above the din of firing a swellingchorus rose upon the night, startling and weird in such a time andplace. Monmouth's pious infantry went into action singing hymns, andWentworth, impatient to be at his post, bade his men go faster.The night was by now growing faintly luminous, and the deathly greylight of approaching dawn hung in the mists upon the moor. Objects grewvisible in bulk at least, if not in form and shape, by the time thelittle company had reached the end of Weston village and come uponthe deep mud dyke which had been Wentworth's objective--a ditch thatcommunicated with the great rhine that served the King's forces so wellon that night of Sedgemoor.Within some twenty paces of this Wentworth called a halt, and would havehad Wilding's hands pinioned behind him, and his eyes blindfolded, butthat Wilding begged him this might not be done. Wentworth was, as weknow, impatient; and between impatience and kindliness, perhaps, heacceded to Wilding's prayer.He even hesitated a moment at the last. It was in his mind to speak someword of comfort to the doomed man. Then a sudden volley, more terrificthan any that had preceded it, followed by hoarse cheering away toeastward, quickened his impatience. He bade the sergeant lead Mr.Wilding forward and stand him on the edge of the ditch. His object wasthat thus the man's body would be disposed of without waste of time.This Wilding realized, his soul rebelling against this fate whichhad come upon him in the very hour when he most desired to live. Madthoughts of escape crossed his mind--of a leap across the dyke, and awild dash through the fog. But the futility of it was too appalling.The musketeers were already blowing their matches. He would suffer theignominy of being shot in the back, like a coward, if he made any suchattempt.And so, despairing but not resigned, he took his stand on the very edgeof the ditch. In an irony of obligingness he set half of his heels overthe void, so that he was nicely balanced upon the edge of the cutting,and must go backwards and down into the mud when hit.It was this position he had taken that gave him an inspiration in thatlast moment. The sergeant had moved away out of the line of fire, and hestood there alone, waiting, erect and with his head held high, hiseyes upon the grey mass of musketeers--blurred alike by mist andsemi-darkness--some twenty paces distant along the line of which glowedeight red fuses.Wentworth's voice rang out with the words of command."Blow your matches!"Brighter gleamed the points of light, and under their steel pots thefaces of the musketeers, suffused by a dull red glow, sprang for amoment out of the grey mass, to fade once more into the general greynessat the word, "Cock your matches!""Guard your pans!" came a second later the captain's voice, and then:"Present!"There was a stir and rattle, and the dark, indistinct figure standingon the lip of the ditch was covered by the eight muskets. To the eyes ofthe firing-party he was no more than a blurred shadowy form, showing alittle darker than the encompassing dark grey."Give fire!"On the word Mr. Wilding lost the delicate, precarious balance he hadbeen sustaining on the edge of the ditch, and went over backwards, atthe imminent risk--as he afterwards related--of breaking his neck.At the same instant a jagged, eight-pointed line of flame slashed thedarkness, and the thunder of the volley pealed forth to lose itself inthe greater din of battle on Penzoy Pound, hard by.CHAPTER XXIII. MR. WILDING'S BOOTSIn the filth of the ditch, Mr. Wilding rolled over and lay prone. Hethrew out his left arm, and rested his brow upon it to keep his faceabove the mud. He strove to hold his breath, not that he might dissembledeath, but that he might avoid being poisoned by the foul gases that,disturbed by his weight, bubbled up to choke him. His body half sankand settled in the mud, and seen from above, as he was presently seenby Wentworth--who ran forward with the sergeant's lanthorn to assurehimself that the work had been well done--he had all the air of beingnot only dead but already half buried.And now, for a second, Mr. Wilding was in his greatest danger, and thisfrom the very humaneness of the sergeant. The fellow advanced to thecaptain's side, a pistol in his hand. Wentworth held the light aloft andpeered down into that six feet of blackness at the jacent figure."Shall I give him an ounce of lead to make sure, Captain?" quoth thesergeant. But Wentworth, in his great haste, had already turned about,and the light of his lanthorn no longer revealed the form of Mr.Wilding."There is not the need. The ditch will do what may remain to be done, ifanything does. Come on, man. We are wanted yonder."The light passed, steps retreated, the sergeant muttering, and thenWentworth's voice was heard by Wilding some little distance off."Bring up your muskets!""Shoulder!""By the right--turn! March!" And the tramp, tramp of feet recededrapidly.Wilding was already sitting up, endeavouring to get a breath of purerair. He rose to his feet, sinking almost to the top of his boots inthe oozy slime. Foul gases were belched up to envelop him. He seizedat irregularities in the bank, and got his head above the level of theground. He thrust forward his chin and took great greedy breaths in avery gluttony of air--and never came Muscadine sweeter to a drunkard'slips. He laughed softly to himself. He was alone and safe. Wentworthand his men had disappeared. Away in the direction of Penzoy Pound thesounds of battle swelled ever to a greater volume. Cannons were boomingnow, and all was uproar--flame and shouting, cheering and shrieking,the thunder of hastening multitudes, the clash of steel, the pounding ofhorses, all blent to make up the horrid din of carnage.Mr. Wilding listened, and considered what to do. His first impulse wasto join the fray. But, bethinking him that there could be little placefor him in the confusion that must prevail by now, he reconsidered thematter, and his thoughts returning to Ruth--the wife for whom he hadbeen at such pains to preserve himself on the very brink of death--heresolved to endanger himself no further for that night.He dropped back into the ditch, and waded, ankle deep in slime, to theother side. There he crawled out, and gaining the moor lay down awhileto breathe his lungs. But not for long. The dawn was creeping pale andghostly across the solid earth, and a faint fresh breeze was stirringand driving the mist in wispy shrouds before it. If he lingered there hemight yet be found by some party of Royalist soldiers, and that would beto undo all that he had done. He rose, and struck out across the peatyground. None knew the moors better than did he, and had he been withGrey's horse that night, it is possible things had fared differently,for he had proved a surer guide than did Godfrey, the spy.At first he thought of making for Bridgwater and Lupton House. By nowRichard would be on his way thither with Ruth, and Wilding was in hastethat she should be reassured that he had not fallen to the musketsof Wentworth's firing-party. But Bridgwater was far, and he beganto realize, now that all excitement was past, that he was utterlyexhausted. Next he thought of Scoresby Hall and his cousin Lord Gervase.But he was by no means sure that he might count upon a welcome. Gervasehad shown no sympathy for Monmouth or his partisans, and whilst he wouldhardly go so far as to refuse Mr. Wilding shelter, still Wilding felt anaversion to seeking what might be grudged him. At last he bethought himof home. Zoyland Chase was near at hand; but he had not been there sincehis wedding-day, and in the mean time he knew that it had been used asa barrack for the militia, and had no doubt that it had been wrecked andplundered. Still, it must have walls and a roof, and that, for the time,was all he craved, that he might rest awhile and recuperate his wastedforces.A half-hour later he dragged himself wearily up the avenue between theelms--looking white as snow in the pale July dawn--to the clearing infront of his house.Desertion was stamped upon the face of it. Shattered windows and hangingshutters everywhere. How wantonly they had wrecked it! It might havebeen a church, and the militia a regiment of Cromwell's iconoclasticPuritans. The door was locked, but going round he found a window--oneof the door-windows of his library--hanging loose upon its hinges. Hepushed it wide, and entered with a heavy heart. Instantly somethingstirred in a corner; a fierce growl was followed by a furious bark, anda lithe brown body leapt from the greater into the lesser shadows toattack the intruder. But at one word of his the hound checked suddenly,crouched an instant, then with a queer, throaty sound bounded forward ina wild delight that robbed it on the instant of its voice. It found itanon and leapt about him, barking furious joy in spite of all hisvain endeavours to calm it. He grew afraid lest the dog should drawattention. He knew not who--if any--might be in possession of hishouse. The library, as he looked round, showed a scene of wreckage thatexcellently matched the exterior. Not a picture on the walls, not anarras, but had been rent to shreds. The great lustre that had hungfrom the centre of the ceiling was gone. Disorder reigned alongthe bookshelves, and yet there and elsewhere there was a certainorderliness, suggesting an attempt to straighten up the place afterthe ravagers had departed. It was these signs made him afraid the housemight be tenanted by such as might prove his enemies."Down, Jack," he said to the dog for the twentieth time, patting itssleek head. "Down, down!"But still the dog bounded about him, barking wildly."Sh!" he hissed suddenly. Steps sounded in the hall. It was as hefeared. The door was suddenly thrown open, and the grey morning lightgleamed upon the long barrel of a musket. After it, bearing it, entereda white-haired old man.He paused on the threshold, measuring the tall disordered stranger whostood there, his figure a black silhouette against the window by whichhe had entered."What seek you here, sir, in this house of desolation?" asked the voiceof Mr. Wilding's old servant.He answered but one word. "Walters!"The musket dropped with a clatter from the old man's hands. He sank backagainst the doorpost and leaned there an instant; then, whimpering andlaughing, he came tottering forward--his old legs failing him in thisexcess of unexpected joy--and sank on his knees to kiss his master'shand.Wilding patted the old head, as he had patted the dog's a little whileago. He was oddly moved; there was a knot in his throat. No home-comingcould well have been more desolate. And yet, what home-coming could havebrought him such a torturing joy as was now his? Oh, it is good to beloved, if it be by no more than a dog and an old servant!In a moment Walters was himself again. He was on his feet, scrutinizingWilding's haggard face and disordered, filthy clothes. He broke intoexclamations between dismay and reproach, but these Wilding interruptedto ask the old man how it happened that he had remained."My son John was a sergeant in the troop that quartered itself here,sir," Walters explained, "and so they left me alone. But even had it notbeen for that, I scarcely think they would have harmed an old man. Theywere brave fellows for all the mischief they did here, and they seemedto have little heart in the service of the Popish King. It wasthe officers drove them on to all this damage, and once they'dstarted--well, there were rogues amongst them saw a chance of plunder,and they took it. I have sought to put the place to rights; but they didsome woeful, wanton mischief."Wilding sighed. "It's little matter, perhaps, as the place is no longermine."No... no longer yours, sir?""I'm an attainted outlaw, Walters," he explained. "They'll bestow it onsome Popish time-server, unless King Monmouth can follow up by greatervictories to-night's. Have you aught a man may eat or drink?"Meat and wine, fresh linen and fresh garments did old Walters find him;and when he had washed, eaten, and drunk, Mr. Wilding wrapped himselfin a dressing-gown and laid himself down to sleep on a settle in thelibrary, his servant and his dog on guard.Not above an hour, however, was he destined to enjoy his hard-earnedrest. The light had grown, meanwhile, and from grey it had turnedgolden, the heralds of the sun being already in the east. In thedistance the firing had died down to a mere occasional boom.Suddenly old Walters raised his head to listen. The beat of hoofs wasdrawing rapidly near, so near that presently he rose in alarm, fora horseman was pounding up the avenue, had drawn rein at the mainentrance.Walters knit his brows in perplexity, and glanced at his master whoslept on utterly worn out. A silent pause followed, lasting someminutes. Then it was the dog that rose with a growl, his coat bristling,and an instant later there came a sharp rapping at the hall door."Sh! Down, Jack!" whispered Walters, afraid of rousing Mr. Wilding. Hetiptoed softly across the room, picked up his musket, and, calling thedog, went out, a great fear in his heart, but not for himself.The rapping continued, growing every instant more urgent, so urgent thatWalters was almost reassured. Here was no enemy, but surely some onein need. Walters opened at last, and Mr. Trenchard, grimy of face andhands, his hat shorn of its plumes, his clothes torn, staggered with anoath across the threshold."Walters!" he cried. "Thank God! I thought you'd be here, but I wasn'tcertain. Down, Jack!"The hound was barking madly again, having recognized an old friend."Plague on the dog!" growled Walters. "He'll wake Mr. Wilding.""Mr. Wilding?" said Trenchard, and checked midway across the hall. "Mr.Wilding?""He arrived here a couple of hours ago, sir...""Wilding here? Oddsheart! I was more than well advised to come. Where ishe, man?""Sh, sir! He's asleep in the library. You'll wake him, you'll wake him!"But Trenchard never paused. He crossed the hall at a bound, and flungwide the library door. "Anthony!" he shouted. "Anthony!" And in thebackground Walters cursed him for a fool. Wilding leapt to his feet,awake and startled."Wha... Nick!""Oons!" roared Nick. "You're choicely found. I came to send toBridgwater for you. We must away at once, man.""How--away? I thought you were in the fight, Nick.""And don't I look as if I had been?""But then..."The fight is fought and lost; there's an end to the garboil. Monmouthis in full flight with what's left him of his horse. When I quitted thefield, he was riding hard for Polden Hill." He dropped into a chair, hisaccents grim and despairing, his eyes haggard."Lost?" gasped Wilding, and his conscience pricked him for a moment,remembering how much it had been his fault--however indirectly--thatFeversham had been forewarned. "But how lost?" he cried a moment later."Ask Grey," snapped Trenchard. "Ask his craven, numskulled lordship. Hehad as good a hand in losing it as any. Oh, it was all most infernallymishandled, as has been everything in this ill-starred rising. Grey sentback Godfrey, the guide, and attempted in the dark to find his own wayacross the rhine. He missed the ford. What else could the fool havehoped? And when he was discovered and Dunbarton's guns began to play onus--hell and fire! we ran as if Sedgemoor had been a race-course."The rest was but the natural sequel. The foot, seeing our confusion,broke. They were rallied again; broke again; and again were rallied; butall too late. The enemy was up, and with that damned ditch between usthere was no getting to close quarters with them. Had Grey ridden round,and sought to turn their flank, things might have been--O God!--theywould have been entirely different. I did suggest it. But for my painsGrey threatened to pistol me if I presumed to instruct him in his duty.I would to Heaven I had pistolled him where he stood."Walters, at gaze in the doorway, listened to the bitter tirade. Wilding,on the settle, sat silent a moment, his elbows on his knees, his chinin his hands, his eyes set and grim as Trenchard's own. Then he masteredhimself, and waved a hand towards the table where stood food and wine."Eat and drink, Nick," he said, "and we'll discuss what's to be done.""It'll need little discussing," was Nick's savage answer as he rose andwent to pour himself a cup of wine. "There's but one course open to us--instant flight. I am for Minehead to join Hewling's horse, which wentthere yesterday for guns. We might seize a ship somewhere on the coast,and thus get out of this infernal country of mine."They discussed the matter in spite of Trenchard's having said that therewas nothing to discuss, and in the end Wilding agreed to go with him.What choice had he? But first he must go to Bridgwater to reassure hiswife."To Bridgwater?" blazed Trenchard, in a passion at the folly of thesuggestion. "You're clearly mad! All the King's forces will be there inan hour or two.""No matter," said Wilding, "I must go. I am dead already, as ithappens." And he related his singular adventure in Feversham's camp lastnight.Trenchard heard him in amazement. If any suspicion crossed his mind thathis friend's love affairs had had anything to do with rousing Fevershamprematurely, he showed no sign of it. But he shook his head at Wilding'sinsistence that he must first go to Lupton House."Shalt send a message, Anthony. Walters will find some one to bear it.But you must not go yourself."In the end Mr. Trenchard prevailed upon him to adopt this course,however reluctant he might be. Thereafter they proceeded to make theirpreparations. There were still a couple of nags in the stables, in spiteof the visitation of the militia, and Walters was able to find freshclothes for Mr. Trenchard above-stairs.A half-hour later they were ready to set out on this forlorn hope ofescape; the horses were at the door, and Mr. Wilding was in the actof drawing on the fresh pair of boots which Walters had fetched him.Suddenly he paused, his foot in the leg of his right boot, and satbemused a moment.Trenchard, watching him, waxed impatient. "What ails you now?" hecroaked.Without answering him, Wilding turned to Walters. "Where are the bootsI wore last night?" he asked, and his voice was sharp--oddly sharp,considering how trivial the matter of his speech."In the kitchen," answered Walters."Fetch me them." And he kicked off again the boot he had half drawn on."But they are all befouled with mud, sir.""Clean them, Walters; clean them and let me have them."Still Walters hesitated, pointing out that the boots he had brought hismaster were newer and sounder. Wilding interrupted him impatiently. "Doas I bid you, Walters." And the old man, understanding nothing, went offon the errand."A pox on your boots!" swore Trenchard. "What does this mean?"Wilding seemed suddenly to have undergone a transformation. His gloomhad fallen from him. He looked up at his old friend and, smiling,answered him. "It means, Nick, that whilst these excellent boots thatWalters would have me wear might be well enough for a ride to the coastsuch as you propose, they are not at all suited to the journey I intendto make.""Maybe," said Nick with a sniff, "you're intending to journey to TowerHill?""In that direction," answered Mr. Wilding suavely."I am for London, Nick. And you shall come with me.""God save us! Do you keep a fool's egg under that nest of hair?"Wilding explained, and by the time Walters returned with the bootsTrenchard was walking up and down the room in an odd agitation. "Odds mylife, Tony!" he cried at last. "I believe it is the best thing.""The only thing, Nick.""And since all is lost, why..." Trenchard blew out his cheeks andsmacked fist into palm. "I am with you," said he.CHAPTER XXIV. JUSTICEIt has fallen to my lot in the course of this veridical chronicle of Mr.Anthony Wilding's connection with the Rebellion in the West, and of hiswedding and post-nuptial winning of Ruth Westmacott, to relate certainmatters of incident and personality that may be accounted strange. Butthe strangest yet remains to be related. For in spite of all that hadpassed between Sir Rowland Blake and the Westmacotts on that memorablenight of Sunday to Monday, on which the battle of Sedgemoor was lostand won, towards the end of that same month of July we find him not onlyback at Lupton House, but once again the avowed suitor of Mr. Wilding'swidow. For effrontery this is a matter of which it is to be doubtedwhether history furnishes a parallel. Indeed, until the circumstancesare sifted it seems wild and incredible. So let us consider these.On the morrow of Sedgemoor, the town of Bridgwater becameinvested--infested were no whit too strong a word--by the King's forcesunder Feversham and the odious Kirke, and there began a reign of terrorfor the town. The prisons were choked with attainted and suspectedrebels. From Bridgwater to Weston Zoyland the road was become an avenueof gallows, each bearing its repulsive grimace-laden burden; for theKing's commands were unequivocal, and hanging was the order of the day.It is not my desire at this stage to surfeit you with the horrors thatwere perpetrated during that hideous week of July, when no man's lifewas safe from the royal butchers. The awful campaign of Jeffries andhis four associates was yet to follow, but it is doubtful if it couldcompare in ruthlessness with that of Feversham and Kirke. At least, whenJeffries came, men were given a trial--or what looked like it--and thereremained them a chance, however slender, of acquittal, as many lived toprove thereafter. With Feversham there was no such chance. And it wasof this circumstance that Sir Rowland Blake took the fullest and thecowardliest advantage.There can be no doubt that Sir Rowland was a villain. It might beurged for him that he was a creature of circumstance, and that hadcircumstances been other it is possible he had been a credit to hisname. But he was weak in character, and out of that weakness he haddeveloped a Herculean strength in villainy. Failure had dogged him ineverything he undertook. Broken at the gaming-tables, hounded out oftown by creditors, he was in desperate straits to repair his fortunesand, as we have seen, he was not nice in his endeavours to achieve thatend.Ruth Westmacott's fair inheritance had seemed an easy thing to conquer,and to its conquest he had applied himself to suffer defeat as he hadsuffered it in all things else. But Sir Rowland did not yet acknowledgehimself beaten, and the Bridgwater reign of terror dealt him a freshhand--a hand of trumps. With this he came boldly to renew the game.He was as smooth as oil at first, a very penitent, confessing himselfmad in what he had done on that Sunday night--mad with despair and rageat having been defeated in the noble task to which he had turned hishands. His penitence might have had little effect upon the Westmacottshad he not known how to insinuate that it might be best for them to lendan ear to it--and a forgiving one."You will tell Mr. Westmacott, Jasper," he had said, when Jasper toldhim that they could not receive him, "that he would be unwise not to seeme, and the same to Mistress Wilding."And old Jasper had carried his message, and had told Richard of thewicked smile that had been on Sir Rowland's lips when he had uttered it.Now Richard was in many ways a changed man since that night at WestonZoyland. A transformation seemed to have been wrought in him as odd asit was sudden, and it dated from the moment when with tears in hiseyes he had wrung Wilding's hand in farewell. Where precept had failed,Richard found himself converted by example. He contrasted himself inthat stressful hour with great-souled Anthony Wilding, and saw himselfas he was, a weakling, strong only in vicious ways. Repentance claimedhim; repentance and a fine ambition to be worthier, to resemble asnearly as his nature would allow him this Anthony Wilding whom he tookfor pattern. He changed his ways, abandoned drink and gaming, and gainedthereby a healthier countenance. Then in his zeal he overshot his mark.He developed a taste for Scripture-reading, bethought him of prayers,and even took to saying grace to his meat. Indeed--for conversion,when it comes, is a furious thing--the swing of his soul's pendulumthreatened now to carry him to extremes of virtue and piety. "O Lord!"he would cry a score of times a day, "Thou hast brought up my soul fromthe grave; Thou hast kept me alive that I should not go down to thepit!"But underlying all this remained unfortunately the inherent weakness ofhis nature--indeed, it was that very weakness and malleability made thissudden and wholesale conversion possible.Upon hearing Sir Rowland's message his heart fainted, despite his goodintentions, and he urged that perhaps they had better hear what thebaronet might have to say.It was three days after Sedgemoor Fight, and poor Ruth was worn andexhausted with her grief--believing Wilding dead, for he had sent nomessage to inform her of his almost miraculous preservation. The thinghe went to do in London was fraught with such peril that he foresawbut the slenderest chance of escaping with his life. Therefore, he hadargued, why console her now with news that he lived, when in a few daysthe headsman might prove that his end had been but postponed? To do somight be to give her cause to mourn him twice. Again he was haunted bythe thought that, in spite of all, it may have been pity that had sogrievously moved her at their last meeting. Better, then, to wait;better for both their sakes. If he came safely through his ordeal itwould be time enough to bear her news of his preservation.In deepest mourning, very white, with dark stains beneath her eyesto tell the tale of anguished vigils, she received Sir Rowland in thewithdrawing-room, her brother at her side. To his expressions ofdeep penitence he found them cold; so he passed on to show them whatdisastrous results might ensue upon a stubborn maintaining of thisattitude of theirs towards him."I have come," he said, his eyes downcast, his face long-drawn, for hecould play the sorrowful with any hypocrite in England, "to do somethingmore than speak of my grief and regret. I have come to offer proof of itby service."We ask no service of you, sir," said Ruth, her voice a sword ofsharpness.He sighed, and turned to Richard. "This were folly," he assured hiswhilom friend. "You know the influence I wield.""Do I?" quoth Richard, his tone implying doubt."You think that the bungled matter at Newlington's may have shaken it?"quoth Blake. "With Feversham, perhaps. But Albemarle, remember, trustsme very fully. There are ugly happenings in the town here. Men are beinghung like linen on a washing-day. Be not too sure that yourself arefree from all danger." Richard paled under the baronet's baleful,half-sneering glance. "Be not in too great haste to cast me aside, foryou may find me useful.""Do you threaten, sir?" cried Ruth."Threaten?" quoth he. He turned up his eyes and showed the whites ofthem. "Is it to threaten to promise you my protection; to show you how Ican serve you?--than which I ask no sweeter boon of heaven. A word fromme, and Richard need fear nothing.""He need fear nothing without that word," said Ruth disdainfully. "Suchservice as he did Lord Feversham the other night...""Is soon forgotten," Blake cut in adroitly. "Indeed, 'twill be mostconvenient to his lordship to forget it. Think you he would care to haveit known that 'twas to such a chance he owes the preservation of hisarmy?" He laughed, and added in a voice of much sly meaning, "The timesare full of peril. There's Kirke and his lambs. And there's no sayinghow Kirke might act did he chance to learn what Richard failed to dothat night when he was left to guard the rear at Newlington's!""Would you inform him of it?" cried Richard, between anger and alarm.Blake thrust out his hands in a gesture of horrified repudiation."Richard!" he cried in deep reproof and again, "Richard!""What other tongue has he to fear?" asked Ruth."Am I the only one who knows of it?" cried Blake. "Oh, madam, why willyou ever do me such injustice? Richard has been my friend--my dearestfriend. I wish him so to continue, and I swear that he shall find mehis, as you shall find me yours.""It is a boon I could dispense with," she assured him, and rose. "Thistalk can profit little, Sir Rowland," said she. "You seek to bargain.""You shall see how unjust you are," he cried with deep sorrow. "It isbut fitting, perhaps, after what has passed. It is my punishment. Butyou shall come to acknowledge that you have done me wrong. You shall seehow I shall befriend and protect him."That said, he took his leave and went, but he left behind him a shrewdseed of fear in Richard's mind, and of the growth that sprang from itRichard almost unconsciously transplanted something in the days thatfollowed into the heart of Ruth. As a result, to make sure that no harmshould come to her brother, the last of his name and race, she resolvedto receive Sir Rowland, resolved in spite of Diana's outspoken scorn, inspite of Richard's protests--for though afraid, yet he would not have itso--in spite even of her own deep repugnance of the man.Days passed and grew to weeks. Bridgwater was settling down to peaceagain--to peace and mourning; the Royalist scourge had spread toTaunton, and Blake lingered on at Lupton House, an unwelcome but anundeniable guest.His presence was as detestable to Richard now as it was to Ruth, forRichard had to submit to the mockery with which the town rake lashed hisgodly bearing and altered ways. More than once in gusts of sudden valourthe boy urged his sister to permit him to drive the baronet from thehouse and let him do his worst. But Ruth, afraid for Richard, bade himwait until the times were more settled. When the royal vengeance hadslaked its lust for blood it might matter little, perhaps, what talesSir Rowland might elect to carry.And so Sir Rowland remained and waited. He assured himself that he knewhow to be patient, and congratulated himself upon that circumstance.Wilding dead, a little time must now suffice to blunt the sharp edge ofhis widow's grief; let him but await that time, and the rest should beeasy, the battle his. With Richard he did not so much as trouble himselfto reckon.Thus he determined, and thus no doubt he would have acted but for anunforeseen contingency. A miserable, paltry creditor had smoked him outin his Somerset retreat, and got a letter to him full of dark hints ofa debtor's gaol. The fellow's name was Swiney, and Sir Rowland knew himfor fierce and pertinacious where a defaulting creditor was concerned.One only course remained him: to force matters with Wilding's widow. Fordays he refrained, fearing that precipitancy might lose him all; it washis wish to do the thing without too much coercion; some, he was notcoxcomb enough to think--coxcomb though he was--might be dispensed with.At last one Sunday evening he decided to be done with dallying, and tobring Ruth between the hammer and the anvil of his will. It was thelast Sunday in July, exactly three weeks after Sedgemoor, and theodd coincidence of his having chosen such a day and hour you shallappreciate anon.They were on the lawn taking the cool of the evening after anoppressively hot day. By the stone seat, now occupied by Lady Hortonand Diana, Richard lay on the sward at their feet in talk with them,and their talk was of Sir Rowland. Diana--gall in her soul to see thebaronet by way of gaining yet his ends--chid Richard in strong terms forhis weakness in submitting to Blake's constant presence at Lupton House.And Richard meekly took her chiding and promised that, if Ruth would butsanction it, things should be changed upon the morrow.Sir Rowland, all unconscious--reckless, indeed--of this, sauntered withRuth some little distance from them, having contrived adroitly to drawher aside. He broke a spell of silence with a dolorous sigh."Ruth," said he pensively, "I mind me of the last evening on which youand I walked here alone."She flashed him a glance of fear and aversion, and stood still. Underhis brow he watched the quick heave of her bosom, the sudden flow andabiding ebb of blood in her face--grown now so thin and wistful--and herealized that before him lay no easy task. He set his teeth for battle."Will you never have a kindness for me, Ruth?" he sighed.She turned about, her intent to join the others, a dull anger in hersoul. He sat a hand upon her arm. "Wait!" said he, and the tone inwhich he uttered that one word kept her beside him. His manner changed alittle. "I am tired of this," said he."Why, so am I," she answered bitterly."Since we are agreed so far, let us agree to end it.""It is all I ask.""Yes, but--alas!--in a different way. Listen now.""I will not listen. Let me go.""I were your enemy did I do so, for you would know hereafter a sorrowand repentance for which nothing short of death could offer you escape.Richard is under suspicion.""Do you hark back to that?" The scorn of her voice was deadly. Had itbeen herself he desired, surely that tone had quenched all passion inhim, or else transformed it into hatred. But Blake was playing for afortune, for shelter from a debtor's prison."It has become known," he continued, "that Richard was one of the earlyplotters who paved the way for Monmouth's coming. I think that that, inconjunction with his betrayal of his trust that night at Newlington's,thereby causing the death of some twenty gallant fellows of KingJames's, will be enough to hang him."Her hand clutched at her heart. "What is't you seek?" she cried. It wasalmost a moan. "What is't you want of me?""Yourself," said he. "I love you, Ruth," he added, and stepped close upto her."O God!" she cried aloud. "Had I a man at hand to kill you for thatinsult!"And then--miracle of miracles!--a voice from the shrubs by which theystood bore to her ears the startling words that told her her prayer wasanswered there and then."Madam, that man is here."She stood frozen. Not more of a statue was Lot's wife in the moment oflooking behind her than she who dared not look behind. That voice! Avoice from the dead, a voice she had heard for the last time in thecottage that was Feversham's lodging at Weston Zoyland. Her wild eyesfell upon Sir Rowland's face. It showed livid; the nether-lip suckedin and caught in the strong teeth, as if to prevent an outcry; the eyeswild with fright. What did it mean? By an effort she wrenched herselfround at last, and a scream broke from her to rouse her aunt, hercousin, and her brother, and bring them hastening towards her across thesweep of lawn.Before her, on the edge of the shrubbery, a grey figure stood erect andgraceful, and the face, with its thin lips faintly smiling, its darkeyes gleaming, was the face of Anthony Wilding. And as she stared hemoved forward, and she heard the fall of his foot upon the turf, theclink of his spurs, the swish of his scabbard against the shrubs, andreason told her that this was no ghost.She held out her arms to him. "Anthony! Anthony!" She staggered forward,and he was no more than in time to catch her as she swayed.He held her fast against him and kissed her brow. "Sweet," he said,"forgive me that I frightened you. I came by the orchard gate, and mycoming was so timely that I could not hold in my answer to your cry."Her eyelids fluttered, she drew a long sighing breath, and nestledcloser to him. "Anthony!" she murmured again, and reached up a hand tostroke his face, to feel that it was truly living flesh.And Sir Rowland, realizing, too, by now that here was no ghost,recovered his lost courage. He put a hand to his sword, then withdrewit, leaving the weapon sheathed. Here was a hangman's job, not aswordsman's, he opined--and wisely, for he had had earlier experience ofMr. Wilding's play of steel.He advanced a step. "O fool!" he snarled. "The hangman waits for you.""And a creditor for you, Sir Rowland," came the voice of Mr. Trenchard,who now pushed forward through those same shrubs that had masked hisfriend's approach. "A Mr. Swiney. 'Twas I sent him from town. He'slodged at the Bull, and bellows like one when he speaks of what you owehim. There are three messengers with him, and they tell of a debtor'sgaol for you, sweetheart."A spasm of fury crossed the face of Blake. "They may have me, andwelcome, when I've told my tale," said he. "Let me but tell of AnthonyWilding's lurking here, and not only Anthony Wilding, but all the restof you are doomed for harbouring him. You know the law, I think," hemocked them, for Lady Horton, Diana, and Richard, who had come up,stood now a pace or so away in deepest wonder. "You shall know it betterbefore the night is out, and better still before next Sunday's come.""Tush!" said Trenchard, and quoted, "'There's none but Anthony mayconquer Anthony.'""'Tis clear," said Wilding, "you take me for a rebel. An odd mistake!For it chances, Sir Rowland, that you behold in me an accredited servantof the Secretary of State."Blake stared, then fell a prey to ironic laughter. He would have spoken,but Mr. Wilding plucked a paper from his pocket, and handed it toTrenchard."Show it him," said he, and Blake's face grew white again as he read thelines above Sunderland's signature and observed the seals of office. Helooked from the paper to the hated smiling face of Mr. Wilding."You were a spy?" he said, his tone making a question of the odiousstatement. "A dirty spy?""Your incredulity is flattering, at least," said Wilding pleasantly ashe repocketed the parchment, "and it leads you in the right direction. Ineither was nor am a spy.""That paper proves it!" cried Blake contemptuously. Having been a spyhimself, he was a good judge of the vileness of the office."See to my wife, Nick," said Wilding sharply, and made as if to transferher to the care of his friend."Nay," said Trenchard, "'tis your own duty that. Let me discharge theother for you." And he stepped up to Blake and tapped him briskly on theshoulder. "Sir Rowland," said he, "you're a knave." Sir Rowland staredat him. "You're a foul thing--a muckworm--Sir Rowland," added Trenchardamiably, "and you've been discourteous to a lady, for which may Heavenforgive you--I can't.""Stand aside," Blake bade him, hoarse with passion, blind to all risks."My affair is with Mr. Wilding.""Aye," said Trenchard, "but mine is with you. If you survive it, you cansettle what other affairs you please--including, belike, your businesswith Mr. Swiney.""Not so, Nick," said Wilding suddenly, and turned to Richard. "Here,Richard! Take her," he bade his brother-in-law."Anthony, you damned shirk-duty, see to your wife. Leave me to my owndiversions. Sir Rowland," he reminded the baronet, "I have called you aknave and a foul thing, and faith! if you want it proven, you need butstep down the orchard with me."He saw hesitation lingering in Sir Rowland's face, and he uncurled thelast of the whip he carried. "I'd grieve to do a violent thing beforethe ladies," he murmured deprecatingly. "I'd never respect myself againif I had to drive a gentleman of your quality to the ground of honourwith a horsewhip. But, as God's my life, if you don't go willingly thisinstant, 'tis what will happen."Richard's newborn righteousness prompted him to interfere, to seek toavert this threatened bloodshed; his humanity urged him to let mattersbe, and his humanity prevailed. Diana watched this foreshadowing oftragedy with tight lips, pale cheeks. Justice was to be done at last,it seemed, and as her frightened eye fell upon Sir Rowland she knew notwhether to exult or weep. Her mother--understanding nothing--plied hermeanwhile with whispered questions.As for Sir Rowland, he looked into the old rake's eyes agleam withwicked mirth, and rage welled up to choke him. He must kill this man."Come," said he. "I'll see to your fine friend Wilding afterwards.""Excellent," said Trenchard, and led the way through the shrubbery tothe orchard.Ruth, reviving, looked up. Her glance met Mr. Wilding's; it quickenedinto understanding, and she stirred. "Is it true? Is it really true?"she cried. "I am being tortured by this dream again!""Nay, sweet, it is true; it is true. I am here. Say, shall I stay?"She clung to him for answer. "And you are in no danger?""In none, sweet. I am Mr. Wilding of Zoyland Chase, free to come and goas best shall seem to me." He begged the others to leave them a littlewhile, and he led her to the stone seat by the river. He set her at hisside there and told her the story of his escape from the firing-party,and of the inspiration that had come to him on the morrow to make useof the letter in his boot which Sunderland had given him for Monmouthin the hour of panic. Monmouth's cavalier treatment of him when he hadarrived in Bridgwater had precluded his delivering that letter at thecouncil. There was never another opportunity, nor did he again think ofthe package in the stressful hours that followed. It was not until thefollowing morning that he suddenly remembered it lay undelivered, andbethought him that it might prove a weapon to win him delivery from thedangers that encompassed him."It was a slender chance," he told her, "but I employed it. I waited inLondon, in hiding, close upon a fortnight ere I had an opportunity ofseeing Sunderland. He laughed me to scorn at first, and threatened mewith the Tower. But I told him the letter was in safe hands and wouldremain there in earnest of his good behaviour, and that did he have mearrested it would instantly be laid before the King and bring his ownhead to the block more surely even than my own. It frightened him; butit had scarcely done so, sweet, had he known that that precious letterwas still in my boot, for my boot was on my leg, and my leg was in theroom with the rest of me."He surrendered at last, and gave me papers proving that Trenchardand I--for I stipulated for old Nick's safety too--were His Majesty'saccredited agents in the West. I loathed the title. But..."--he spreadhis hands and smiled--"it was that or widowing you."She took his face in her hands and stroked it fondly, and they sat thusuntil a dry cough behind them roused them from their joyous silence. Mr.Trenchard was sauntering towards them, his left eye tucked farther underhis hat than usual, his hands behind him."'Tis a thirsty evening," he informed them."Go, tell Richard so," said Wilding, who knew naught of Richard'saltered ways."I've thought of it; but haply he's sensitive on the score of drinkingwith me again. He has done it twice to his undoing.""He'll do it a third time, no doubt," said Mr. Wilding curtly, andTrenchard, taking the hint, turned with a shrug, and went up the lawntowards the house. He found Richard in the porch, where he hadlingered fearfully, waiting for news. At sight of Mr. Trenchard's grim,weather-beaten countenance he came forward suddenly."How has it sped?" he asked, his lips twitching on the words."Yonder they sit," said Trenchard, pointing down the lawn."No, no. I mean... Sir Rowland.""Oh, Sir Rowland?" cried the old sinner, as though Sir Rowland weresome matter long forgotten. He sighed. "Alas, poor Swiney! I fear I'vecheated him.""You mean?""Art slow at inference, Dick. Sir Rowland has passed away in the odourof villainy."Richard clasped nervous hands together and raised his colourless eyes toheaven."May the Lord have mercy on his soul!" said he."May He, indeed!" said Trenchard, when he had recovered from hissurprise. "But," he added pessimistically, "I doubt the rogue's inhell."Richard's eyes kindled suddenly, and he quoted from the thirtieth Psalm,"'I will extol thee, O Lord; for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast notmade my foes to rejoice over me.'"Dumbfounded, wondering, indeed, was Westmacott's mind unhinged,Trenchard scanned him narrowly. Richard caught the glance andmisinterpreted it for one of reproof. He bethought him that his joy wasunrighteous. He stifled it, and forced his lips to sigh "Poor Blake!""Poor, indeed!" quoth Trenchard, and adapted a remembered line of hisplay-acting days to suit the case. "The tears live in an onion thatshall water his grave. Though, perhaps, I am forgetting Swiney." Then,in a brisker tone, "Come, Richard. What like is the muscadine you keepat Lupton House?""I have abjured all wine," said Richard."A plague you have!" quoth Trenchard, understanding less and less. "Haveyou turned Mussulman, perchance?""No," answered Richard sternly; "Christian."Trenchard hesitated, rubbing his nose thoughtfully. "Hum," said he atlength. "Peace be with you, then. I'll leave you here to bay the moonto your heart's content. Perhaps Jasper will know where to find me abrain-wash." And with a final suspicious, wondering look at the whilombibber, he passed into the house, much exercised on the score of thesanity of this family into which his friend Anthony had married.Outside, the twilight shadows were deepening."Shall we home, sweet?" whispered Mr. Wilding. The shadows befriendedher, a veil for her sudden confusion. She breathed something that seemedno more than a sigh, though more it seemed to Anthony Wilding.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mistress Wilding, by RafaelSabatini*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MISTRESS WILDING ******** This file should be named 1457.txt or 1457.zip ***** This andall associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/5/1457/Produced by An Anonymous Volunteer and David WidgerUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will berenamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no oneowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (andyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permissionand without paying copyright royalties.

Frank BaumRoyal Historian of OzThis book is dedicated toLachie Dunnwho first discovered the existence of Saber-Tooth Light-bulbsCHAPTER 1THE COWARDLY LION'S HEROIC DEEDIn all the world, there is no country or township known that can evercompare against the beauty and magnitude of the Marvelous Land of Oz.This is not a debatable issue. The Land of Oz is not only beautiful withthe glittering gemstones that are found commonplace in this remarkablefairyland, but its enchantment goes ever farther. In all the territoryof Oz, there is clean, fresh air and gorgeous trees and scenery. Thereis peace and quiet when such is desired, and there is high adventure andexcitement at other times. In Oz, no one ever grows older than hechooses, and death is practically unheard of. The country is situated inthe center of a vast continent, and is surrounded by an impassableDeadly Desert.Although the vast Deadly Desert Around Oz aptly prevents tourism fromabroad, those who are fortunate enough to live on the proper side ofthis sandy enigma will surely testify that the land is as no other.The country itself is divided into five distinct regions. The mostimportant of these is the Emerald City. This famous area lies in theexact center of the oblong land, and is home to the supreme ruler overOz. Her name is Ozma, and she is but a tiny child. Even so, no otherruler in any other country has ever been more respected, loved, orenvied. To the south of Ozma's remarkable palace is the QuadlingCountry. This is ruled over by a powerful Witch named Glinda the Good.In the Quadling Country, red is the favored color, and most of thebuildings, walls and furniture are distinctly red in hue. To the westlies the Winkie Country, which is a land where everything is bright andyellow-colored. To the north is the purple Gillikin territory, and tothe east live the Munchkins. Among these little people, blue was clearlythe color of preference.It is to this easternmost region that I wish to direct your attention.It was in the blue Munchkin Country of Oz that a house happened to fallfrom the sky and land with a loud crash atop a most unfortunate WickedWitch.Now although this particular Wicked Witch was about as repugnant as theycome, and her evil doings had brought more misery to more people thancan possibly be recorded in these few pages, it was still rather sad tosee her wicked legacy brought to such an abrupt close. Especially as theparticular house that happened to squish her was one which belonged to atiny little girl named Dorothy Gale. To think that a mere toddler couldbring an end to the story of the Wicked Witch of the East!But the story did not exactly end there. It seems that, before such timeas the old woman's liveliness was shmushed by little Dorothy's home, shehad left a little souvenir to remember her by. Actually, it was quite alarge souvenir!She and her equally-vile sister Allidap, the Wicked Witch of the West,had created the souvenir to do battle with the Wonderful Wizard of Ozhimself. Had it not been for the Wizard's powerful magic charms, he maywell have been defeated. But thanks to his magic, the Wizard of Oz wasable to thwart the attacks of the Witches and banish their souvenir to aforest that lay in the southern land of the Quadlings. But fearing theWitches may try to attack him again, the Wizard hid himself away in theglorious Emerald City and became a hermit.Then, one day, Dorothy's house came down and whumped out the WickedWitch of the East. This, needless to say, was not a healthy situationfor the Wicked Witch. Little Dorothy was advised in the Munchkin Countryto head for the central city and seek out the reclusive old Wizard,being told that he alone could help her to get home to Kansas.It was a long and difficult journey, but the child was equal to thechallenge. Along the way, she chanced to meet up with the Cowardly Lion.He was a formerly respected leader of the Animal Kingdom, but thisparticular lion had fallen into disgrace due to his outlandishlyunkinglike cowardice. He and the little girl became fast friends, andthey journeyed together in search of Oz and, later on, Glinda the Good.It was on their journey to locate Glinda the Good that they happened tostray into the very forest where the Witches' souvenir was staying. Asthey walked through the vast forest, a large and tawny tiger approachedthe Cowardly Lion and bowed subjectively before him."Welcome, O King of Beasts!" quoth the tiger. "You have come in goodtime to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forestonce more.""What is your trouble?" asked the Cowardly Lion in a quiet voice."We are all threatened," answered the tiger, "by a fierce enemy whichhas lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous Monster, likea great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as atree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the Monster crawlsthrough the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to hismouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safewhile this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting todecide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us."The Cowardly Lion thought over the situation carefully."Are there any other lions in this forest?" he enquired."No; there were some, but the Monster has eaten them all. And, besides,they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you."The Lion got an idea that he hoped would help him overcome his disgrace."If I put an end to your enemy," he began, "will you bow down to me andobey me as King of the Forest?""We will do that gladly," returned the big tiger. The rest of the forestanimals voiced assent."Where is this great spider of yours now?" asked the Cowardly Lionbravely."Yonder," said the tiger, indicating with a tawny paw, "among the oaktrees."The Cowardly Lion overcame his fear and ignored the trepidation withinhis heart. He came upon the Forest Monster shortly thereafter. Eventhough it was sound asleep, it was the most ghastly sight that theCowardly Lion had ever laid eyes on. It was huge, black and furry. Itwas filthy, too. Its putrid smell had the Lion reeling in spite ofhimself. But he pressed onward. The snores of the ugly Monster revealedits razor-sharp fangs which measured in at at least a foot long. Itspowerful legs were as muscular as those of a Hercules and were as bigaround as a house and as long as the trunk of a tree. The claws on theend of its eight enormous legs were curved and as sharp as scimitars. Itwas quite the sort of thing that nightmares are made of.But the Cowardly Lion noticed that the Forest Monster had one weakness.He was observant enough to notice that, though the spider was so muchlarger than any other spider he had ever seen, its neck was as slenderas a wasp's waist. Given this obvious oversight on the part of theWicked Witches who had designed him, the Forest Monster suddenly seemedless Monstrous to the Cowardly Lion. With a leap and a single blow ofhis mighty paw, he knocked the Forest Monster's head clean off! He thenwatched the writhing body until its legs stopped wiggling and he knewthat it was quite dead.[Illustration: "_With a leap and a single blow of his mighty paw, heknocked the Forest Monster's head clean off!"_]CHAPTER 2ELEPHANT'S DAY"Elephant?" asked Tweaty, a yellow canary who was looking up at thelarge gray beast."Yes?" asked the elephant, who was drinking a tall glass of chocolatemilk with his trunk."I was just thinking about the new Queen of Oz," said the bird solemnly."Do you think she'll last? I mean, I really thought that the WonderfulWizard of Oz himself would rule over the Land forever. Then I placed myconfidence in His Majesty the Scarecrow. Now, out of the blue, we've gotthis little girl who is probably younger than most eggs, and we aresupposed to give her our neverending support?""Why in the world not?" the pachyderm drawled as he indolently stretchedhimself. "Nibbles and I agree that, though she is very young, PrincessOzma shows a lot of promise as Oz's new leader. Give the child a chance.She's only been a Queen for a week or so!""Absolutely, Tweaty!" Nibbles agreed. "And so many rulers have beenyouthful. Remember the old story about King Tut? He was just a littleboy."Few persons guessed that Nibbles, Elephant and Tweaty were old friends,so unlike were they in appearance and disposition. Tweaty was delicate,clean and could sing for hours on end without repeating a tune. He tookpride in his appearance and always made sure that his refulgent featherswere clean. Nibbles, on the other hand, was a mouse. He was often founddigging in the trash that was sometimes left by careless campers orburrowing in other animals' nests. His fur was not what most would deemtidy, but he was amiable and companionable. Elephant, by far thelargest of the three, was less colorful. He liked the other animals, andhe ofttimes wanted to help the smaller creatures as best he could, buthis immense size and bulk generally made him feel more like a nuisancethan a help. In spite of legends that would have us all believe thatelephants are afraid of mice, he found that most of his favoriteplaymates were among the smaller creatures of Oz. He enjoyed fellowshipwith mice, as well as with rabbits and hedgehogs. He had befriendedNibbles at a young age, and it had been Nibbles who had introduced himto Tweaty.The three friends were enjoying a relaxing afternoon in a remote regionof the Munchkin Country known as the Lunechien Forest. It was a time oftransition in the Land of Oz. The child Queen, Ozma of Oz, had just beennamed Ruler over the land. This news had met with mixed reactions. ManyOzites maintained that only the Wonderful Wizard could rule the land.Others favored the amiable Scarecrow. But all admitted that, even thougha tiny little girl, Ozma was a unique leader. She had already proventhat. She had not only created and brought to life a pumpkin-headed mannamed Jack, a wooden Sawhorse, and a wobbly monstrosity with the head ofa Gump, but had also gone forth with these unlikely companions and savedthe Land of Oz from a terrible fate.[Illustration: Elephant, drinking chocolate milk.]"But she's a little girl!" said the bird. "She's a child! Childrenshould be allowed to enjoy their childhoods. This kid should learn toplay jacks or skip a rope. She should have some nice paper dolls todress up. She should have nice toys. She is too young to be a Queen. Lether live a happy life for a while before you go throwing all thatresponsibility on her. She's only a baby, for crying out loud!""She is a cute little thing, though," Elephant remarked, half tohimself."Cute?" Tweaty demanded in surprise. "That is hardly a reason to electsomeone leader. Especially over such a vast country as Oz. Maybe if Ozwere a little dinky insignificant country like America or Kansas, itwould be okay. But Oz is so much bigger than those places. Elephant,don't you think that adorable infant deserves a childhood to enjoybefore getting schlepped into Queenhood unprepared?"Before Elephant could reply, an unexpected occurrence drove all idlethoughts from his mind. It all happened in an instant.From the ends of the earth to the top of the sky, an unearthly roarissued forth. It was as blood-curdling as a scream, yet as sinister as ared dragon's growl.Then, before the horrified trio, a gigantic spider loomed before them.It looked as if it were hungry, and it was so uncannily big that itcould easily have devoured all three of them in an instant! It mighthave, too, had it not been distracted by the sight of a small yellow catwhich was darting by. It took the feline in its massive claws and raisedher to its mouth.CHAPTER 3THE FOREST MONSTERElephant stampeded frantically toward the scene, fearing for the life ofthe cat."We'll need all the help we can get," Elephant said grimly. "That animalis big! But it has poor Fisher the Cat. We can't let it eat her up!""Why not?" asked Nibbles.The Elephant slung himself against the Monster's leg as hard as hecould, but the creature did not even seem to notice. In a glance it wasapparent to the bird and the mouse that their companion was in trouble."Elephant!" shouted Tweaty. "Get away from that thing! Look at itsteeth! It will eat your nose off! Get your body away from it!"[Illustration: Elephant vs. Forest Monster]But Elephant was determined. He made a loud trumpet noise and steppedon the Monster's foot. With a howl of pain, the Forest Monster droppedthe cat."What do you think you're doing, to try and eat Fisher up like that? Apoor defenseless cat! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!""I wasn't going to eat her up, you dolt!" said the Monster in a cold andscratchy voice. "I was trying to see if it was a lion. I was told by acertain squirrel that it was a lion who lopped my head off.""But you've still got your head," Tweaty interjected."Yeah, _now_!" said the Monster. "But it was a pain in the neck tryingto get it back! And before I could, my body began to shrink. I keptgetting smaller and smaller. I felt like Alice after eating the wrongthing!""Holy cow!" said Nibbles. "Are you saying that you were once bigger thanyou are now?""No, actually. I found myself a way to restore my size.""How is that?""I have captured a very magical insect-bug in one of my webs. Sweetlittle thing, too. Some people spray insects with a flit gun, but I liketo eat them up. Bugs are yummy in my tummy! But my little Lovebug isspecial. She doesn't go in my tummy. Instead, she gets to stay wound upin my web, only to be let free long enough to give me what I need.""What is that?" asked Elephant with a shudder."The biggest and grandest thing in the universe is, of course, TrueLove. Even though shaped a bit like a cockroach, my Lovebug can producethe stuff inside her teeny little heart. All I have to do is chant acertain incantation and then to have her kiss me once or twice each day,and I stay as big as I like!""But that is terrible!" said Tweaty. "You can't abuse Love that way!Love is supposed to be beautiful and friendly and stuff like that! Tocheapen this sacred gift by forcing someone into submission by magic orforce is an abuse of Love, and not what the gods had in mind for us atall. If you are making this Love-insect your slave, you are abusing thewhole concept and also missing the point!"With another tremendous roar, the huge spider was gone. He obviously didnot care for any more lecturing that day."Good riddance, I say!" spoke Nibbles. "That big old thing was ugly! Andit smelled awful!""Where's Fisher?" asked Elephant."I think the thingy ate her up after all.""I sure hope not!""I'm fine," came the feline meow. "Is that beast gone away yet?""It has," answered the pachyderm. Oddly, neither Nibbles nor Tweaty feltthe slightest tinge of fear at the sight of the cat. In Oz, naturalenemies ofttimes become the dearest of friends. Indeed, Oz is a trulyremarkable land!"I think I saw all nine of my lives flash before me that time!" said thecat. "What in the heck _was_ that thing that had me?""I don't know," said Elephant. "But I hope we'll never see it again.""But you have to rescue that poor little insect!" said an earthworm,poking her head out of the ground. "Didn't you bozos hear what thatthing said about Lovebug? He's got her stuck in his sticky web, and heis treating her like a slave and he's even making her--ugh!--kiss him!How yucky can you get? You must save that poor little bug. She is a goodbug. Love is always good! Please help her. Please. I can't bear to thinkof her in that predicament!""It's a stupid bug, for crying out loud!" said Tweaty. "Don't you thinkthat we have more important things to do than to go and save a stupidbug?""But this is Oz, where everyone is equal," Nibbles pointed out. "Even acat like Fisher is our friend. In this fantastic country, I'd think thateven a tiny insect is not beneath our concern. I think we should saveher.""Give me a break!" Tweaty said. "I'm not about to face that big uglyMonster again for the sake of a cockroach!""She is not a cockroach," said the worm. "She is a kindly insect whohelps people in need to feel cared about. She has great powers to dothat for people. But that spider is misusing her powers and making herserve him in a most wicked capacity against her will. He is abusing herand she is probably miserable. How can you let him treat such a sweetbeing in such an awful manner?""I, for one, am willing to try to help save Lovebug," said Elephant."Me too," said Nibbles."I think..."Before Tweaty could finish his sentence, a loud scream was heard.Hurrying toward the sound, they found Louie the Lobo with a paleexpression."What happened?" asked Elephant."Something took Tiger!" he said. "I didn't see who it was, but somethingtook him away while we were talking about the Tin Woodman. I don't knowwho would do such a foul thing! Tiger is my best friend! I yelled at thekidnapper, but to no avail. I have lost my best friend!" He began to crylike a kitten."It must have been that awful Forest Monster-Spider!" Nibbles swallowedhard. "I know it was he who did this! He is so horrific! We must getword to the new Queen. We really must!""I agree wholeheartedly," spoke Elephant. "We can not allow this sort ofthing to happen. Do you remember the last time enslavement was happeninghere in our Munchkin country?""I do," said the mouse. "It was when that Wicked Witch had us allenslaved. Oh, she was ever so much worse than I had ever realized! I'mglad that house fell down and made her into mush.""But we cannot count on any houses falling down on this spider man,"said Tweaty with certainty. "You are quite right when you say that weshould do something about it. I was being awfully selfish when I refusedto do anything to help that little bug. But now my eyes are opened. Tothink that not even a tiger is safe in that Monster's wake! This meanssure danger for birds and mice and elephants, too!""Then let's go and inform the new Queen straightaway!" trumpetedElephant. "I am willing to believe that she has the power to help us ifanyone does.""But we should have something to show her to prove that we are notinsane," said Nibbles. "After all, who would ever believe that such abeast could exist? It isn't natural. And besides ..."He cut his sentence short when his eye fell upon a large marking on theground."Gads!" exclaimed Elephant. "That is one of the Monster's footprints!Goodness! Just look how deep it is! That creature must weigh a milliontons!""Yes," agreed Tweaty, flittering into the hole. "This footprint isalmost as big around as a horse! And look at the size of those claws!I'll bet it could rip Elephant in two without even straining itself!""Let's not discuss that," shuddered the pachyderm. "But I think weshould save this footprint for the Queen. Because she is a mere child,she will be most impressed by its mass. I think we should make a cast ofit and carry it to the Emerald City to show her what we are up against."Nibbles and Tweaty hurriedly went to a nearby maple tree and gnawed atits trunk for a time. With Elephant's help, they poured some maplesyrupy sap into the footprint. Elephant blew on this with his stronglungs until it hardened. Then, there before the trio, was a perfect castof the Forest Monster's footprint.Eagerly Elephant snatched it up in his trunk and flung it onto his back."Let's get on our way," he said. The other two nestled upon his headand they were off to the Emerald City of Oz.CHAPTER 4AN UNLIKELY TRIO OF FRIENDSElephant, Tweaty and Nibbles were ready to leave, and it seemed thatdozens of other forest animals were of the same mind. The ferocity ofthe Forest Monster had led many of the denizens of the Lunechien Forestto panic. Many of them wanted to tell the Lord of the Forest about thetrouble, while others elected to go to Glinda the Good, who ruled overthe neighboring Land of the Quadlings. Animals were running to and fro,and there was a mass of confusion."Look out!" Nibbles cried suddenly. "That Unicorn is coming right atus!"Elephant was helpless in trying to avert the disaster. An abnormallyfrightened Unicorn, undoubtedly made nervous by the excitement, had lostcontrol of her footing. She plowed into the rear of the elephant with ajolt which nearly flung the two passengers on his head into GlowingLimbo.Retrieving his companions and determining that they were unhurt, helistened for a few moments to the oft-repeated apologies of the Unicornand then set out again."I sure hope that Queen Ozma can do something about that ugly brute,"said Nibbles."If she can't, we'll be no worse off than when we started," repliedTweaty.The subject was dropped there. Elephant had run most rapidly and thetrio was now approaching the Emerald City."Excuse me," said the man at the gate. "Who are you and what is yourbusiness in the Emerald City?""We want to see the child who has become our Queen," replied Elephant."On what grounds?""On the ground I'm walking upon now, I suppose. Is there a problem?""What is your business with the Queen? If you are here to make fun ofher age, you are welcome to go away. Queen Ozma was sent to us by theFairy Queen Lurline herself, and she has our respect. Even though she isa tiny child, she is not to be made sport of.""No one is making sport of anyone," said Elephant gruffly. "Though ifyou don't get out of my way I may decide to use you for a football.""That will not be necessary," said the guard. "But you will need to weargreen glasses. It is a rule that was set up by the Wonderful Wizard ofOz himself. It is because of the gleaming magnitude of all the biggemstones everywhere. If you don't wear these special glasses, you mightwell be blinded by their brilliance. I hope you won't object to this.""Well," said Elephant. "I fear that your glasses will not fit someone mysize. Nor, for that matter, the smaller sizes of my companions.""Jeepers," said the guard. "I hadn't thought of that. Perhaps you'reright." He practically threw himself into his chestful of green glasses,but found none that would fit the animals. "I guess I'll have to makeyou some. This may take a while, so you'll have to find something to doin the mean.""How about we go and talk to the Queen while you make us our glasses?"suggested Nibbles."A grand idea!" replied the guard. He opened the gate and the companyentered.The Emerald City of Oz is a truly remarkable place. It has had so manyvolumes written about it that it hardly needs a description here, but itshould be noted that our trio was most impressed.Ozma, too, was very impressive. They came upon her while she wasengrossed in playing paper-dolls with another little girl on the palacesteps.[Illustration: Ozma]"Excuse me, your Majesty," said Elephant.The child looked up from her game and smiled at the pachyderm. "Hello,"she said quietly."My Dear Queen," said Elephant, "I and my cohorts are from the LunechienForest of Oz. It is situated in the Munchkin Country, and we are proudto call ourselves your subjects.""Thank you very much," Ozma said politely. "Do you want to playpaper-dolls with us?""I--er, well, I suppose at some point I could be persuaded," stammeredElephant. "But I have come on very important business just now."As the animals watched, Ozma seemed to make a complete transformation.She remained a child, but her eyes suddenly grew solemn and she raisedherself from her seat on the steps. Even though very young andinexperienced, the Child Queen took on an appearance of regal splendor.It made Elephant want to bow down before her, and this he promptly did.It was fortunate that Tweaty could fly, but unfortunate that Nibblescould not. Tweaty zoomed into the air without mishap as soon asElephant's head went down in his bow. Nibbles, however, was thrustthrough the air by the impact of Elephant's exuberant show ofsubjection. He flew toward the child and did not stop until he becamecaught in her pocket. Ozma, being that she was only a little girl afterall, began to scream until Elephant reached into the pocket with histrunk and retrieved the rodent."Thank you," Ozma said, composing herself. "When I was a little boynamed Tip, I'd have probably thought that very funny. But I am beginningto feel like Ozma again. This is who I am truly destined to be. Now tellme, what is the nature of your call?"Elephant and the others quickly explained about the Forest Monster andhow they feared for their lives. As they spoke, the child grew more andmore solemn."It is hard to be a ruler over such a big land as Oz," spoke the childafter she had heard the news concerning the spider creature. "But I amnot willing to allow such a fiendish creature to harm any of mysubjects. I do not know of your Lunechien Forest, but I will do all inmy power to assist you."[Illustration: Lurline, leader of the fairies]CHAPTER 5THE QUEEN OF OZThe magic of Oz began with little more than a simple wish. The man whoruled at that long-forgotten time, King Ozroar, was not a very happymonarch. He ruled the beautiful land, but he had no magic with which toinsure the happiness of the people. Sickening fogs would envelop theland from time to time, and the area was never very prosperous. Still,it was too beautiful to go overlooked by the fairies. These magicalbeings are able to see things as they should be, not only as they are.One fairy who was especially interested in the land of Oz was a leaderof fairies named Lurline.Lurline was no ordinary fairy ruler, though. She had especial insightinto the things that made beauty what it is. It was her keen insightthat once brought her to Mount Olympus. This legendary mountain has longbeen said to be the home of many ancient Gods. According to the Ozianstorytellers, who still today will sit by your campfire and tell you atale in exchange for a cup of tea or a morsel of food, these Immortalsrecognized her abilities at once, and she was admitted into theirsociety of Godhood. As a Goddess, Lurline was able to gain access tomany things.With the help of her fairy band, as well as the input of her sisterfairy, Polychrome, Lurline was able to give the Land of Oz the magicalenchantment that made it what it is today. But she did not do the deedwithout a few pitfalls.Among the things that Lurline required to fulfill the spell's needs wereApollo's own sky chariot, the flying horses to pull it through the air,Kole's essence of crystal, and Lillith's brazier of endless flame. AtPolychrome's suggestion, she also obtained Iris' jug of rainbow.Unfortunately, Lurline was not always scrupulous. In this event, sheelected to take the various magical requirements without the permissionof the various deities. She stole into their chambers at night as theylay sleeping and took the elements she wished. She then went togetherwith her fairy band and performed the enchantment over Oz.She was banished from Mount Olympus as a result of her rash action. But,supposing the legend is all true, the marvelous Land of Oz remains as aglowing tribute to the powers of the Fairy Queen Lurline. And to insureits longevity, Lurline arranged for a fairy ruler to watch over thecountry she had created. Of course, the ruler would have to be a nativeOzite. She would be a beautiful princess.Princess Ozma was born several generations later unto a descendant ofOzroar and his wife Ozia, herself a descendant of fairies and daughterof Oziana. Young Ozma was prepared to take on the leadership of Oz uponreaching adulthood.But Lurline's plan was balked by the arrival of Oscar Zoroaster PhadrigIsaac Norman Henckle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs. This was a mortal man fromoutside of the enchanted land who landed there in a balloon. It had beenhe who had erected the Emerald City, and he who had sold the infant Ozmainto slavery at the hands of a heartless old Witch named Mombi. To hidethe infant queen, Mombi had transformed her into a boy. She believedthat no one would ever think to look to a little boy to find the fairyprincess, so Ozma was aptly hidden away for a very long time.But things in Oz do have a way of working out for the best. After Diggsleft the country, Ozma was found and restored to her proper being. Shehad aged very little, being that Oz folk age only when they choose to,and little Ozma had just been given her rightful place on the royalthrone. Most of this history, of course, was unknown to Elephant andhis companions. They saw only the fact that she was a child. They didnot know of her unique experiences at all. If they had, they'd havesurely recognized that she was more aware of human needs and thedifferences there connected. But even to their eyes, it was clear thatthis child was very special. They had every hope that she would be ableto do as they needed done to rid their land of the terrifying ForestMonster.[Illustration: Tiger caught in a Spiderweb.]CHAPTER 6THE GIANT SPIDERTiger growled as he watched his captor wrap him in the strong webbing.He was a fairly small tiger, but he was accustomed to being larger thanany spider he had ever heard of. This spider, he felt certain, was somesort of a freak of nature. Perhaps a direct result of the humans'constant littering, or maybe a military experiment gone haywire."Ahh, my little pussycat," laughed the creature. "I have you now. Thereis no need for further struggle.""Like I told you before," grumbled Tiger, "I am not a lion. I am astriped tiger. Can't you see that?""I can admit that you do not look like what I had in mind," replied thespider. "However, you are feline in nature. That is all I care aboutjust now.""But it wasn't me who beheaded you. I am innocent!""Perhaps," the spider seemed unconcerned. "Perhaps what you say is true,and then again, perhaps you're Lion to me. In any event, you are at thevery least a distant cousin to that animal that lopped my head off. Whenhe hears that you are in my clutches, he'll be here.""But this is a small, rarely traversed forest," said the tiger. "Itisn't often that news from the Lunechien Forest gets out to the rest ofthe country.""Then you shall stay here as my guest," grinned the spider. "After all,the little insect has been satisfying me less lately. I had been usingher sweet charity to keep myself giant-sized." He stalked over to a wallon the far side of the cave. Indicating two yellowing papers withcrudely drawn human faces on them, he turned back toward his boundprisoner. "These are pictures I drew of the Great Masters. They createdme, and gave me the powers I possess. When they asked me to devour theirbald-headed little enemy, I was only too happy to comply. He had toomuch magic in him, however. I was sent away from my beloved Creators."Tiger thought that the monster was about to cry, but he went on. "I madethe best of it, though. I became the leader of a lot of wild animals inan untamed wood. Oh, they never actually called me that. But they fearedme. You'd better believe it! They were scared spitless by me! Until oneday, when that ... that ... that LION came along and used my head as ifit were a baseball! But I'll get even now, little friend. Believe youme! I will find that lion, and I will chomp his head off! You just waitand see if I don't!" He turned to the drawing of the Witch of the East."I will avenge myself on this lion for us both," he said, crossinghimself."But, really," begged Tiger. "I have no argument with you. Please let mefree. I will help you bag your lion-prey.""Not a bit of that!" snarled the spider. "I have better plans for you.""Better plans?""Most definitely. As I was saying, the bug's no longer sufficient for myneeds. I am told that you have a powerful and courageous heart. Bold andfearless, is it not?""I'm afraid I don't understand your ...""If I use your heartfelt emotions, which seem to be, er ... well,tiger-sized by definition ... If I can do that, I can remain giant-sizedfor time and all eternity. I can be all-powerful! I will be the bravestarachnid on the face of the earth! And next, my little chickadee, I planto capture some little beasts that are called Hootsey and ... Lisa, isit? Owls, I think. They are known for their wisdom and kindness to theirfellow Ozites. I care nothing for their kindness, of course. My powercomes from the negative uses of the senses. But I plan to make use oftheir immense knowledge. Oh, yes! And then, my dear little Tiger, THEN!I shall reach out to my definitive prize in all the Lunechien Forest.That big wrinkly fellow I saw not too long ago. He had a nose like agarden hose, but my little bug has unwittingly told me that he is theone to whom the forest beasts turn when they have problems. He likes tosolve problems, and has a phenomenal knack for it. He is wise beyond hisyears, and his emotions encompass all the land! He is also one of thestrongest and most bold beasts in all the Lunechien territory--evenputting the tigers like you to shame! When I can capture this Elephant,I will be all-powerful! I will be almighty! I will be superhuman! Then,I shall be able to take on the beast who has come to be known as theCowardly Lion. A most unfitting moniker, wouldn't you say, for a fellowwho swiped off my head while I was asleep one day?""You'll never get away with this!" roared Tiger. "Elephant is too bigand strong to be beaten by any spider--even one so large as you!""We'll see about that shortly, Shorty," replied the spider. "Now, won'twe?"CHAPTER 7THE FOREST MONSTER OF OZMeanwhile, word of the monster's plans for Tiger had reached Elephantand Tweaty and Nibbles via Hootsey and Lisa. The trio had been showingOzma the cast of the giant footprint when the owls flew in with thenews. Ozma was astounded that such a beast could live in her domainwithout her being aware of it. And indeed, the beast had kept a fairlylow profile until recently. But it was quite obvious that a powerstruggle was now going on. The beast was gradually finding out that hecould grow larger and stronger at the expense of others and would nodoubt not be satisfied until he was so large and powerful that everyliving creature would be under his domain. Why, even Ozma herself was indanger. The owls quickly informed her that the beast's first goal was tocapture Elephant in order to gain the super strength that would enablehim to attack the Cowardly Lion. However, she knew he had to absorbTiger's power and courage first before he would dream of attackingElephant. It was quite obvious he was going to have to think fast beforeTiger became a mere shell of his old self.Hootsey and Lisa were naturally quite concerned for their own welfare.They did not want their wisdom sucked out of them by a giant spider withvampire-like tendencies. One has to live a long time and learn by trialand error before one can truly be considered wise. Of course, somepeople never learn. They make the same mistakes over and over. However,that is neither here nor there. The point is that Hootsey and Lisa werein as much danger as anyone and were very anxious to help in any waythey could."If I might make a suggestion?" said Hootsey. "I recently came upon someunusual creatures that could very well be a match for the monster."Of course, everyone was all ears, and fell silent as Hootsey began totalk."These creatures are very unusual in that they are technically made ofglass and so would appear to be very fragile. But when they open theirmouths they are a most ferocious sight to behold. They are of a bulbousshape with very long legs that can move at the speed of light--"At this point Nibbles intercepted Hootsey's graphic description."These animals sound most interesting, but they don't sound particularlyferocious--""Oh, wait!" responded Hootsey. "I haven't told you the best part. Theirmouths are filled with razor-sharp teeth and they can rip any animal toshreds in two seconds. When a pack of them attack, the unfortunatevictim never even knows what hit him. It's over that fast."[Illustration: Owl describing Saber-tooth Light-Bulbs]"And what might the name of these creatures be?" responded Elephant."Well," answered Hootsey. "Two important factors contribute to theirname. One is their ability to light their bodies up at night brighterthan a hundred glow worms. The second is when they open their mouths andexpose those teeth you would think you were looking at a Saber-Toothedtiger. Anyone want to guess their name?""_Saber-Toothed Light Bulbs!_" everyone responded in unison.They all began to feel a little better to know that perhaps the dreadfulspider-creature may not be so formidable after all. It was difficult toimagine how he could possibly stand up to a ferocious pack ofSaber-Toothed Light Bulbs. Of course, the next thing that must be donewould be to negotiate with the Saber-Toothed Light Bulbs and see if theywould be willing to take on the monster. The little group was soengrossed in mulling this over that they did not notice a new visitor intheir midst. It was Tweaty who first noticed him and nudged Nibbles inthe ribs. Nibbles looked up to observe the strangest-looking little chapthat he had ever set eyes on. He was a sort of miniature FredFlintstone--short and pudgy. But he had a nose to beat all noses! Itwasn't that it was long or funny shaped or anything. It was just big(and I really mean BIG!). Anyway, when Tweaty poked Nibbles in the ribs,it was a pretty hard poke. And Nibbles let out quite a yell. Everyoneturned to look, and saw the stranger."Excuse me," said the stranger. "I didn't mean to intrude. But I saweveryone here having a meeting and I didn't want to interrupt. However,since I now have your undivided attention, I feel duty-bound to conveythe reason for my being here in the hopes that you will not consider itan intrusion on your privacy.""Well, he is certainly polite," commented Hootsey. "It is my consideredopinion that we should hear what he has to say.""By all means," everyone said, nodding in unison."Well, my mission is really with Queen Ozma. You see, my people haveencountered some border skirmishes with our neighbors to the north andwe were hoping that Queen Ozma could use her good offices and apply herdiplomatic powers of persuasion to encourage them to retreat back intotheir own territory. You see, they are very aggressive in nature;whereas we are a very passive people.""Might I ask if they have made any formal declaration of hostilities?"asked the Queen in her best adult voice."Well, no. Not exactly," responded the little chap. "Perhaps the bestway of clarifying the situation would be for me to read this copy of arecent speech our President gave to our parliamentary congress." Withthat, he pulled out a rolled-up manuscript from his coat pocket with aflourish and began to read;"'Ladies and Gentlemen: I have called this emergency session of the FiveHundredth and Eighteenth Parliamentary Congress to inform you of somevery disturbing developments along our northern border. As president ofthe Sniffer Nation, I need not remind you of the delicate nature of ourhighly sensitive olfactory organs--our noses. And would you believe thatour so-called friendly northern neighbors--the Stinkfoots--have recentlyseen fit to ignore all previous treaties and sense of common decency!They have caused great distress among our border residents by not onlybuilding new residential dwellings right smack up against the border,but have blatantly crossed the border in ever increasing numbers andbrazenly thumbed their ridiculously small noses at Sniffer citizens whowere unfortunate enough to cross their paths. They have also beenobserved taking soil samples from our rich bottom land. The reasons forthis are now known to us. You will be shocked to the core when I revealthis to you in a moment. In the meantime many of our border residentshave become so overwhelmed and nauseated by the smell of the Stinkfootsthat they have moved lock stock and barrel to the city. I immediatelydashed off a letter of protest to the Stinkfoot President, demanding animmediate withdrawal to the previously negotiated line of demarcationtwo miles north of the border.'"I do not wish to alarm our citizens to the point of panic, but I shallnow read to you their President's reply:"'To President Humongous Schnozzle; distinguished Members of the FiveHundredth and Eighteenth Parliamentary Congress of the Sniffer Nation;and to all of the humble citizens of your fair land."'First, let me apologize for not entering into new negotiations regardingour present expansion. But due to a severe blight on our stinkweed crop,which as you know is our staple diet, our people are becoming severelymalnourished. I'm sure that you are all well aware that we are greatlydependent on the stinkweed plant for many purposes, the least of whichis the manufacture of stinkweed pills which we all partake ofreligiously in order to maintain that rich aroma that permeates ourbodies, but which mainly radiates from the area of our feet. As youknow, our olfactory senses are virtually nonexistent, but we are awareof a slight essence of this aroma which we find most pleasing.Unfortunately for others who might stray across our borders, the smelloverpowers them in seconds, rendering any potential invader helpless.Now, as a result of the factors I have just presented to you, we findyour bottom land by our northern borders to be extremely rich innutrients that the stinkweed plant needs to flourish, and preliminaryexperimental results indicate that stinkweed plants grown in thisenvironment are completely immune to the blight that is wiping out ourcrop. Therefore, we have no option but to take as much of your land aswill insure the very survival of the proud nation that we are. That iswhy we did not inform you formally or informally. The matter is simplynot negotiable."'Sincerely"'Stinky McFoot President (Past, Present and Future) of Stinkfootland"'P.S.--It is not our fault that the Sniffer people have such big nosesthat their sense of smell is ultra sensitive to our presence.'"The little group had fallen silent. "You know," said Elephant to Ozma."We are greatly sympathetic to their predicament. However, the situationwith the Stinkfoots and the Sniffers is diverting us from our realproblem--which is that huge, furry, ugly, filthy putrid monstrosity whocalls himself a spider.""That's very true," said Ozma. "But remember, we have to negotiate withthe Saber-Toothed Light Bulbs before we can do anything. In themeantime, the President of the Sniffer Nation has asked our help and wesimply cannot refuse. He and his people are in a real bind.""I'll be in a real bind if that monster attacks me," snapped Elephant."I'll be bound up in his giant web and devoured to death.""Now don't you worry," Ozma replied, reaching up to pat Elephant'strunk. "We won't let anything happen to you."Her answer must have satisfied Elephant, because he wrapped his trunkaround her waist and hoisted her up to his back. Then he walked down tothe stream and took a long drink. As they returned to join the group,Hootsey was clearing his throat and proceeded to speak with pure wisdomdripping from every word. "I have been thinking..."Before he could continue, Lisa interrupted him. "I can see that you'vebeen thinking because smoke is coming out of your ears." Of course shehad a twinkle in her eyes when she said this, but Hootsey did not seethe humor of it."Well that's very funny, Ha! Ha!" he said dryly. "I'm dying of laughter,Ho! Ho! Ho!" After he finished glaring at Lisa, he continued ... "So,anyway, as I was saying," again glaring at Lisa, "_before I was sorudely interrupted!_ There is great diversity in Oz. I mean, there areso many different kinds of people, yet for the most part we all getalong fairly well. Oh, we have our differences of opinion. No questionabout it. But we seem to resolve them without too much upheaval. Well,most of the time. Anyway, the point is--"At that, Tweaty interrupted. "I can see immediately that you have neverbeen to Chilepepperland.""And where, pray tell, is Chilepepperland?" enquired Hootsey with a hintof cynicism. "And why have I never heard of it?""Perhaps you've never heard of it because you're too busy trying tothink of wise things to say," interrupted Nibbles. "After all, you havea reputation to uphold."Hootsey could not be sure if Nibbles was being a "smart alec" or wasjust paying him a complement."Chilepepperland is beyond the great desert," answered Tweaty, "in avery remote region which is surrounded by impenetrable terrain composedof jagged rocks. There is only one narrow passageway which twists andturns every which way through the rocks. The sides of the passageway arequite sheer. If you were looking down from above, it would just seemlike a chasm because you cannot see the path at the bottom. Besides, theroad disappears in places where it goes under the rocks. The entrance iscompletely hidden by prickly pear bushes which are plentiful in theregion. That is why no one has ever heard of Chilepepperland. Because itis basically cut off from civilization.""How did you discover it?" Elephant asked with genuine curiosity."Well," continued Tweaty, "I happened to be flying over the area one dayand spotted a group of green chilepeppers having a picnic. They invitedme to lunch and told me all about their turbulent history. It seems thatChilepepperland was first occupied by several tribes of red chilepepperswho were, for the most part, peace-loving. Oh, they had occasional smallskirmishes among themselves. But they lived in relative harmony for manymany years; living off the land which they treated with great reverencebecause it provided all their food. They also had great respect for theanimal kingdom. They were never wasteful; giving constant thanks to thegreat spirit who, they believed, watched over them and provided for themabundantly. They believed in sharing their bounty with one another, andthis they did frequently with great ceremony. Then one fateful day, thefirst group of yellow chilepeppers arrived from a foreign shore. Atfirst there was a mutual understanding between the newcomers and theindigenous people. The red chilepeppers were very helpful in assistingthe newcomers to adapt to their new surroundings. In return, they weregiven trinkets that sparkled, such as colored glass beads, hand mirrorsand such, the like of which they'd never set eyes on before. The redchilepeppers were an innocent people, really quite primitive compared tothe sophisticated so-called civilized newcomers who, incidentally, werevery quick to take advantage of the childlike trust the red chilepeppersdisplayed in their early contacts. They moved quickly to take fulladvantage of these simple trustful souls. And as more and more yellowchilepeppers arrived, they moved across the country taking whatever landthey needed without any regard for the previous occupants. This lead tomuch fighting and eventual total conquest of the red chilepeppers whowere forced to give up their beautiful lands and moved to less desirableareas. This broke their spirit, for they were once a very proudpeople--roaming at will the vast prairies and forests. And to this daythey remain second-class citizens, really. Never able to assimilate intothe world of the yellow chilepeppers, nor ever able to return to thetotal freedom they once knew.""That has to be the saddest story I've ever heard," said Elephant."Those yellow chilepeppers are just rotten dogs! How could they treattheir fellow chilepeppers that way just because they were red instead ofyellow?""I assume that they were uncomfortable with people who they considered'different,'" answered Ozma. "Also, they wanted the best land forthemselves.""Anyway, that's not all," continued Tweaty. "After they took those lushlands away from the rightful owners, they desecrated much of it over theyears, seeing it only as something to take from and to pour harshchemicals into for various reasons of their own. The red chilepeppershad always blessed the land, given it thanks for its bounty andreplenished it when they took from it. Yet the yellow chilepeppersconsidered them primitive and savage. And that's still not all! Thegreen chilepeppers went on to tell me about the treatment that _they_received at the hands of the yellow chilepeppers. It seems that theyalso lived in a land of their own far away across the Nonestic Ocean.One day a group of yellow chilepeppers, who were visiting the area intheir ship, came ashore and captured some of them and took them back toChilepepperland and sold them to plantation owners in the southern partof Chilepepperland ...""Oh, come on!" said Nibbles, who had been very silent all this time."You can't sell people.""In those days you could," Tweaty responded. "At least, according to thegreen chilepeppers I talked to. They not only sold the people theycaptured as slaves, but they went back again and again to capture moregreen chilepeppers and sold them, too. And by the way, a lot of thegreen chilepeppers died in the terrible voyage en route.""But how could the leaders of the yellow chilepeppers allow this tohappen?" asked Ozma. "I would never allow even an unkind remark to passbetween them if I were their leader. And I would have made the yellowchilepeppers take the green chilepeppers back to their own peopleimmediately.""Well, as a matter of fact," continued Tweaty, "the yellow chilepeppers'leader lived in the north, and he thought very poorly of thisarrangement. A lot of other people agreed with him, and he abolishedslavery forever from the land. But it caused the yellow chilepeppers tofight among themselves and, to this day, some yellow chilepeppers stilldo not consider the green chilepeppers to be equal in status tothemselves--and can be quite discriminating in their treatment of them.That is, when they can get away with it. They even confine themeconomically and socially to areas that are less desirable to live.Quite naturally, this causes great resentment among many of the greenchilepeppers and sometimes their anger is unleashed in unfortunate ways.This in turn causes an even greater chasm between the two groups.""How terrible!" Elephant said. "Chilepepperland sounds like a horribleplace to live! I hope I never even have to visit there.""It sounds to me," said Ozma, "that if every single chilepepper wholives in Chilepepperland really wanted to, they could live in Peace andLove and Harmony alongside each other forever and ever. And then itwould be a perfectly wonderful place to live.""The problem as I see it," said Hootsey, looking as wise as he could,"is that for every chilepepper of whatever color whose heart is filledwith love and kindness for his fellows, there are probably several whocannot generate those feelings within themselves. So I predict that theunfortunate state of affairs in that dark land will continue for quitesome time to come. It's a very negative prognosis, I know. But theaccumulated wisdom I have acquired over many years tells me that this isso.""I know one thing," said Lisa. "The people who live in the land whereDorothy comes from are much too intelligent to allow such foolishness toexist there."The other members of the little group turned to each other knowingly,and slowly shook their heads. For they knew that the unfortunate fact ofthe matter was that the land where Dorothy came from had had a similarhistory. In fact, even as I write these words, there are people in themortal lands who have lost their homes and all of their worldlypossessions, and many, their lives, simply because they had themisfortune to be born different in some way than their neighbors.Everyone became very quiet as he assimilated all that had been said.Ozma spoke first. "I would like to read, if I may, a poem from a littlebook given to me by a dear friend. I was reminded of this poem whenTweaty spoke of the difficulties the green chilepepper peopleencountered. The poem was written by a mortal human named William Blake.It is called _The Little Black Boy_."     _My mother bore me in the southern wild     And I am black, but O my soul is white     White as an angel is the English child     But I am black, as if bereaved of light.     My mother taught me underneath a tree,     And, sitting down before the heat of the day,     She took me on her lap and kissed me,     And, pointing to the East, began to say:     "Look on the rising sun: there God does live,     And gives His light, and gives His heat away,     And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive     Comfort in the morning, joy in the noonday.     "And we are put on Earth a little space     That we may learn to bear the beams of love;     And these black bodies and this sunburnt face     Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove.     "For, when our souls have learned the heat to bear,     The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,     Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care,     And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.'"     Thus did my mother say, and kissed me,     And thus I say to the little English boy.     When I from black, and he from white cloud free.     And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,     I'll shade him from the heat 'til he can bear     To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;     And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,     And be like him, and he will then love me._By the time Ozma had read the last line, tears were streaming downeveryone's face."That is the most beautiful poem I have ever heard..." Elephant sobbed,as Tweaty dabbed his eyes with a tailfeather, "...and so very sad thatit will take so long for True Love to exist between all peoples. Onlywhen they realize that in the ultimate sense there is no differencebetween them."The story of the chilepeppers and the poem by William Blake lefteveryone in a very somber mood. But Time was not standing still, and youcan be sure that that mean-spirited old spider-monster was not lettingany grass grow under his feet. Even now he was no doubt growing strongerby the minute by sucking strength and courage out of any victim who hadbeen unfortunate enough to be caught in his deadly web."We must be on our way," Ozma said, shivering slightly. "Elephant, whydon't we all ride on you, and we'll talk as we go along and plan ourstrategy.""Good idea," Elephant answered, picking Ozma up again.Meanwhile, Tweaty and the owls flew up and perched on Elephant's head.Elephant then lowered his trunk to allow Nibbles to jump aboard and belifted up behind Ozma."Okay, every one!" shouted Elephant as he raised his trunk high in theair and let out a great trump which just about blew everyone off hisback. He then proceeded to waddle down the road making trumping soundsthat sounded suspiciously like a trombone playing the bass part to _Whenthe Saints go marching in_. In fact, pretty soon everyone was singingalong--     _Oh when the saints     Go mar chin' in.     When the saints go marchin' in.     Lord, I want to be in that number,     When the saints go marchin' in..._[Illustration: Sniffer and Stinkfoot arguing.]CHAPTER 8THE JOURNEY TOWARD THE SNIFFER NATION"As I see it," said Lisa as they traveled along, "there is at least onemajor difference between the problems in the Sniffer Nation and theproblems of Chilepepperland. The Chilepeppers, so far as I candetermine, are different from one another only in their viewpoints. Somemay have had a better education than others, but all were bornessentially equal. On the other hand, even if they were born equal, theSniffer citizens have a real physical reason for their disagreement withthe Stinkfoots. If you will forgive my saying so, I cannot believe thateither group is necessarily better or more important than the other.It's just that they are physically unable to co-exist.""As much as it pains me to say it," replied the Sniffer citizen, "I haveto agree. After all, the Stinkfoot people used to get along fine with mypeople, so long as we kept our distance from one another. Now that theStinkfoots are infringing on our territory, we are forced to take actionagainst them despite our former friendship. But there simply is noalternative. They are taking away our homeland, and pushing us away.There is no other option but to push them back.""It is a real problem when one specie overcrowds its territory," addedHootsey. "It must pave away all other life forms to further supply itsown needs.""But no one has the right to crowd out what Nature has alreadyestablished," said Elephant. "Just imagine the chaos it would create if,say, the human race were to become so plentiful that it was levelingrain forests and wiping out all other forms of life to make room foritself.""That would be terrible," agreed Hootsey. "And it is exactly what theStinkfoots are doing. Once they have pushed the Sniffers into eitherisolation or extinction, they may continue to outgrow the territory theyoccupy and move into other regions where they will do even more damage.""They have to be stopped at any cost," said the Sniffer man."No," said Ozma. "Not at any cost. Even though they are doing bad, theyare still counted among my subjects. They are not enemies to Oz, and Iwill not have them entirely devastated. Our plan has to be fair to bothsides, not just one. As we have said, neither side is better than theother. You yourself agreed. We can't allow either race to be lost infavor of the other. That would upset the balance of Nature.""But how else can we stop them from expanding to wherever they like?"asked the Sniffer citizen."There has to be a fair way to settle the dispute," replied the littleQueen. "And it is up to us to find it.""What if we forbade them from eating any more stinkweeds?" suggestedNibbles. "That way, they wouldn't smell so bad, and the Sniffers wouldhave no further trouble with them. Also, they would no longer need to beliving in an area that would help the stinkweeds grow.""You heard the letter," answered Lisa. "They won't agree to that. Theylike the smell that they get from the weeds, and they believe it willprevent anyone attacking them. They would never go along with thatplan.""We're almost there" sighed the Sniffer citizen. "But we are no closerto an agreement. What can we do?""I intend to speak with your President," replied Ozma. "And I will alsomeet with the Stinkfoot President."Ozma and the Lunechien party of five was greeted at the border of theSniffer Nation by President Humongous Schnozzle himself. Indeed, he musthave had the largest nose that Ozma had ever seen. It was longer thanthat of Elephant! "Probisquous!" he said joyfully. "You're back! And youhave brought an army with you!""Hello, Mr. President," said the Sniffer messenger. "This is Queen Ozmaof Oz and with her are Elephant, Lisa, Hootsey, Tweaty and Nibbles fromthe Lunechien Forest of Oz. I have told them of our plight, and theyhave come to try and help.""And not a moment too soon," said President Schnozzle. "The Stinkfootshave sent me another letter. This time, they are threatening to burndown our village if we do not surrender immediately, I hope that yoursmall army is prepared to stand up to them.""I did not come to fight," said Ozma with a firmness that surprised evenher. "I want to see the two sides come to an arrangement. If that is notpossible, we may then have to resort to stronger measures.""I'm afraid that the Stinkfoots are beyond reasoning," sighed PresidentSchnozzle. "The only recourse we have is to fight fire with fire."Ozma could see that the Sniffer President was not going to deviate fromhis present frame of mind without a struggle. "I do understand yourposition and I sympathize with your feelings," she said. "However,before anyone does anything rash, I wish to speak to President McFoot.""Then I suggest that you hold your nose," replied Schnozzle. "Otherwise,you'll be overwhelmed by the stench and probably pass out.""I'll take that chance," said the little Queen. "Just give me an hour totalk to Mr. McFoot before you start any uprising.""I will give you all the time you want," replied the Sniffer President."At least, from my side. But if those stinkers start anything, you'dbetter believe that I will not sit doggo and let them destroy ourhomes.""Fair enough," said Ozma. She then followed Probisquous to the edge ofthe Stinkfoot Nation. "I can't take you any further," he said. "My eyesare already starting to water. I hope you can handle the stinkiness fromthis point onward. It gets worse the closer you come to those guys."Ozma thanked him and went on her way. Indeed, the smell was a potentone. She could see why it would ward off any potential attackers. Shetried to hold her breath, but that was not something she could doindefinitely. She tried holding her nose and breathing with her mouth,but that was hardly a dignified pose for the Queen of all Oz. When thestench became absolutely unbearable, she found herself face to face witha little boy who sported the tiniest nose she could have imagined. Itwas about the same size as that of a ladybug. His feet, on the otherhand, were enormous. "Who are you?" asked the lad."I amb Queen Ozba of Oz," she said with some difficulty. "I amb here tovisit with President Stinky McFoot of the Stinkfoot Nation.""I thought your nose was too small to make you a Sniffer," he said. "Butit is sure a lot bigger than any Stinkfoot's. Hey, why are you holdingit like that?""I'mb afraid that I'mb having a hard time dealing with the sbell of thestinkweeds," she explained, not wanting to hurt the boy's feelings bymentioning his feet, which Ozma felt certain were the real source of theoffensive smell. She believed that it would be better to avoid anystatement that might be taken as a gesture of insult."The stinkweeds?" replied the boy. "But they are delicious. They are ourprimary food."This was not going very well, and the little Queen was already feelingnauseated by the stench. She would not be able to take much timeexplaining her situation before she became physically ill. Thisproposed a problem, as she had never known illness to exist in Oz.Still, it was a matter that would require a bit of research. "I bust seeyour President," she sniffled uneasily. "Can you take be to himb?""Of course," said the boy simply, taking a handful of the stinkweeds andeating it. "I can take you to his mansion, anyway. I don't know if he'llwant to talk. He is preparing to fight the Sniffers for control of thefertile lands, and is very busy with that right now.""That's just the thing," said Ozma. "I need to discuss that batter withhimb.""Well," said the boy, "you are the Queen. Follow me."Ozma followed the lad as quickly as she could under the circumstances.The smell only grew more pungent with each step. It was overpowering.But she knew that she had to help the two rivals to come to anarrangement quickly, as the Forest Monster could be doing nearlyanything at this point, and she was losing valuable time. She wishedthat she had sent the forest animals on to speak to the Saber-ToothedLight Bulbs without her, but she knew in her heart that such an actmight well have endangered her new friends. If she were not with theanimals, the Light Bulbs might well have attacked them. No, this was allshe could do. She only hoped that she had not chosen the wrong skirmishto settle first.When she came to the mansion of President Stinky McFoot, she saw that itwas expansive. It was a good sixteen acres wide, and had more rooms thanany one man could possibly make use of. She hurriedly knocked on theheavy oak door.Her knock was answered by a Stinkfoot who was dressed as a butler."Yes?" he said to her."I amb Queen Ozba of Oz," she explained. "I amb here to speak to thePresident.""Queen Ozba of Oz?" replied the butler. "But you are just a child. Howcan you be the queen of anything? Except possibly a toy box.""I amb Queen Ozba!" she said. "I amb serious! I bean it!""Okay," chuckled the Stinkfoot. "I'll play along for a moment. If youare the Queen of Oz, what is it you wish to speak to President McFootabout?""He is planning a war with the Sniffer Nation," said the Queen. "I wantto try to find a better way for your people to solve your differences.""That is very touching," laughed the butler. "But if you were really theQueen of Oz, you would surely know that the matter is already settled.The Sniffer-snuffers will have to let us have the land we need tosurvive, and that is all there is to it. Now, go home little girl. Wehave a lot to attend to, and there really isn't any time for yourgames.""But I amb really the Queen!" objected she."Yes," said the butler, "and I am Charles Dickens. My wife is the Queenof England. Now do run along." He shut the door before Ozma had a chanceto say anything more."This is not going at all as I planned," sighed Ozma. But the pungentodor was already more than she could take, and she knew that she mustget to some fresh air immediately if she was to be of any practical useto either the Sniffers or the denizens of the Lunechien Forest.Dejectedly, she returned to the Sniffer Nation. She was gasping for airby the time she arrived there, and so she breathed in several lungfulsof the cleaner, purer stuff. It was a treat that she was grateful for."So what did Stinky McStink have to say?" President Schnozzle asked Ozmaupon her return."I did not get in to see Mr. McFoot," said Ozma sourly. "But I sure didget a noseful of your immediate problem.""Our immediate problem is the fact that a bunch of people withstinky-feet are planning to attack and burn our village to the ground. Iam sorry, Your Majesty, but we are left with no other recourse but to goto war with them and destroy them all before they do it to us. Surelyyou can see that they are unreasonable and unkind and un-un--well, abunch of other words that start with 'un.' We can't allow them toUN-ify us if we can help it, and we Sniffers are a proud people who willnot give in without a fight!""President Schnozzle," sighed Ozma. "I am not trying to belittle you oryour pride. I just don't think that resorting to violence is the way todeal with any situation. It only leads to misery for both sides.""Not if we win," replied the President."In times of war," said Lisa, "there are no winners." The hoot-owl hadstayed back with the four Lunechien animals at the Sniffer President'smodest home, and was also a little disappointed at Ozma's failure tospeak to the Stinkfoot leader. So much had been riding on this meeting.But Ozma had not gotten in to see him, and the simple fact remained thatthey were no closer to a solution than they had been before."Maybe we need those Saber-Toothed Light Bulbs right here," suggestedNibbles. "Then the Stinkfoots would be too scared to start a fight.""I doubt it," reasoned President Schnozzle. "I'm not even sure that anySaber-Toothed Light Bulbs could handle the stinky smell of thosebuzzards.""Maybe not," said Hootsey. "But it is an idea. What if we were to scarethe Stinkfoots back into their own territory?""That may be possible," said Ozma. "It looked to me like they had noproblem of overpopulation. It was really just their desire to grow morestinkweeds, and their incapability to do so in their soil.""That's right!" said Lisa. "But no soil can go indefinitely growing thesame crop. Anyone who lives in the forest knows that! And even theMunchkin farmers rotate their crops to keep their soil in balance.""Rotate it?" scoffed the Sniffer President. "You mean like a phonographrecord on a turntable?""No," replied Lisa. "I mean that if, say, a farmer plants carrots in hisfields this year, he will plant something totally different next year.This way, the nutrients in the soil stay in balance and can be used toraise more carrots some other year. It's really very simple. It's kindof like replenishing with one crop what was diminutized by another.""So you think that, if the Stinkfoots were to grow carrots instead ofstinkweeds for a year, they could go back to stinkweeds next year?" saidthe President uncertainly."I'd say more than likely," agreed Lisa."But," put in Hootsey, "the Stinkfoots can't live without theirstinkweed. Or they refuse to, in any event""Maybe we have a solution," grinned Ozma."But we don't," said Hootsey. "They will refuse to give up theirstinkweeds. You know it's true.""Not if they can have them," said Ozma. "Listen, President Schnozzle.What would you think of letting the Stinkfoots use your land to growtheir food here this year, while the Sniffer farmers use the StinkfootNation to grow anything that they want to eat? You can simply switchterritories every year, and the rotation of crops will keep both of yoursoils fertile."The Sniffer President sat down in a wooden chair. He was obviously deepin thought. "You know," he said after a time, "I think you havesomething there. If we can only state this plan to the Stinkfoots, I'msure it would work. I am beginning to recall that even our own farmershave spoken about this rotation of crops on at least one occasion. AndI'd bet that the stinkweeds would have made the soil over there idealfor our dietary staples!""More than likely!" said Lisa wisely."This is all very nice," said Elephant. "But how are we to propose thisidea to a people who is as unwilling to listen as a deaf tree-stump?""We have got to gain an audience with President McIdiot--I mean,President McFoot. I suppose it does me no good to make fun of hisfoolishness.""Not foolishness," said Nibbles. "Just lack of education. I didn't knowuntil you guys just said so that rotation of crops was a good idea. Mr.McFoot just doesn't know about farming. He may be a very very wise manin a lot of other subjects.""I think you're right," agreed President Schnozzle. "And I am sorry thatI reacted so harshly to his actions, which I can now see that he did outof true concern and love for his subjects.""In any situation," said Lisa, "it is always best to act, rather than tore-act. It makes you look a lot brighter.""I wholeheartedly agree," said Elephant. "However, we still have tofigure out a way to get McFoot into a position to speak to us.""Yes," said Ozma, "that is true. If only we could lure him into aneutral place with a strong downwind, then we could ..."The little Queen's words were cut off as a sickening stench suddenlyblew in from the open window. A booming voice cried out, "That is thehome of Schtupidface Schnozzle! Torch the place!"Schnozzle ran to the window and saw President McFoot in his militaryregalia, and he was backed up by several dozen Stinkfoots carryingtorches."Oh, no!" moaned the Sniffer President. "We are too late!"The entire party hurried out the door, but were too late to stop theoffensive army from setting fire to the home of President Schnozzle."My home!" cried he. "My books! My teddy bear! My original Rembrandt!""Halt!" cried Ozma. "I am your Queen!""It's that silly little girl I told you about, Master," said a Stinkfootthat Ozma recognized as the man who had answered the door. "Ignore thelittle scamp and let's get on with our revolution!""Wait a minute!" shuddered President McFoot. "I have seen pictures ofthe Queen of Oz in the newspapers. The place no longer is run by thatScarecrow man. I think this child is telling the truth!"The Stinkfoot soldiers suddenly stood at attention and saluted Ozma."Your Majesty," spoke the Stinkfoot President, "I am sorry to inform youthat there is a war on. We have need of something that these Sniffersare not allowing us to have. Our survival depends on theirannihilation.""No," spoke Ozma. "It does not. My dear friends from the LunechienForest have determined the problems with your crops, and we have come toa solution." She quickly outlined the plan to rotate crops andterritory."But the silly Sniff-heads have such a modest capitol building," sniffedPresident McFoot. "I would not want to live in that little old shack,not even for a day!""In case you've forgotten," said Elephant, "your troops have just burnedup that little shack. I suggest that you put them to work rebuilding itin such a way that it will be pleasing to you both.""If I go along with this idea," said the Stinkfoot leader, "willSchnozface do the same?""I have already agreed to it," said President Schnozzle. "Though I mustadd that the whole place be fumigated before we trade back. If you don'tbind, I'mb starting to feel a little queasy."With the situation settled, Ozma felt very pleased that there had beenno war. Still, there was the other matter to contend with. There maystill have to be a war to defeat the Forest Monster that was terrorizingthe Lunechien Forest. Of course, Ozma would have preferred that it besettled as well as this situation had been, but this Monster wasobviously not going to be ready to listen to reason for at least ajillion years. By that time, there may be no one left in Oz to stop him.CHAPTER 9ONWARD TOWARD THE SABER-TOOTHED LIGHT BULBSThe Sniffers and Stinkfoots agreed to help in the Lunechien Forestshould their services be needed to help stop the devastation broughtabout by the spider-monster. President Schnozzle handed Ozma a smallperfume bottle that, when opened, would release a perfume that could besmelled only by a Sniffer, and would reach the distance from the forestin only a matter of minutes. Ozma pocketed the little bottle and thankedthe Sniffer and Stinkfoot Presidents. Then Ozma and the party of fivewas on its way to the land of the Saber-Toothed Light Bulbs."How far is it from here?" asked Elephant, who was still carrying theothers on his broad back."Well," said Hootsey, "it isn't exactly close. We will have to travelthrough some fairly rough territory to get to the Light Bulbs. But I'msure our pachyderm is up to it, if anyone is. And we do have our newQueen along as well. I really don't think we'll have too many problems."However, unbeknownst to the little owl, problems were exactly what layahead of them. The elephant walked on for a few miles without incident,but then came upon a marshy area. "I don't remember this place," saidHootsey with disdain.The marshy area was barren of all trees. Stretched out before them laywhat seemed to be miles of reeds surrounding patches of dirty lookingwater with steam rising to form a veritable fog. The whole area lookedvery formidable and quite scary."I don't like this a bit," Elephant remarked, with a concernedexpression on his face. "Who knows what's laying in wait under thatwater? And it doesn't look as if we could get very far without walkingthrough it.""And who knows how deep the water is?" Tweaty said. "It could be twofeet or twenty; maybe even some of the solid ground is reallyquicksand!"Just then a loud twittering sound was heard; soft at first but thenincreasing in volume to totally surround the little group. Then headsappeared above the reeds to signify the source of the twittering. Theheads were square; powdery white; and with round eyes like you might seeon a stuffed toy--except the expression on the square faces was anythingbut cute. One rather large creature stood up to reveal a body of thesame substance. His whole body looked as if it was composed of giantmarshmallows, including his arms and legs."_I suppose_," he shouted in a booming voice that sounded as if it werecoming out of the bottom of a barrel. "I suppose you people think youare going to traverse our lands.""Not really," answered Elephant."Oh, how silly of me. Of course you are just here for a picnic,"responded the creature with a sneer. "I should have realized. Quick!Grab 'em, boys!"The little band was immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatureswho threw fishing nets over them, then rolled out wooden cages onwheels.After everyone was confined in the cages, the leader stepped forward toaddress them again."Big mistake. Big mistake you made coming here. Not one trespasser hasever set foot on our land and lived to tell the tale. You see, we arethe Keepers of the Crocodiles who live in these marshes and swamps. Andin return for keeping them well fed, they have agreed not to eat us andto allow us to coexist with them in these waters. The substance of ourbodies is a sweet marshmallow material and we would be prey to all kindsof creatures if we had to depart these lands. We were made of the samematerial you are at one time, but we made the mistake of crossing swordswith a Wicked Witch and in a fit of anger, before you could say 'JackyRobinson,' she changed us into marshmallows. So here we are, and hereyou are, just in time to feed a bunch of hungry crocodiles. Which is toobad, really, but that's life--death sooner or later. And in your case,it's sooner."Elephant and Nibbles and Tweaty and Hootsey and Ozma and Lisa all lookedat each other with despair and foreboding."Look," said Elephant to the leader of the marshmallow people. "I am ahuge animal. My body will keep those crocodiles fed for weeks. WhileTweaty here, and Hootsey and Lisa, are tiny creatures. The crocodileswould not even taste them. Why don't you let them go?""Hmmmm," murmured the marshmallow leader. "You have a point there. Infact, the crocodiles could get quite annoyed with us for feeding themsuch tiny morsels. Okay. We'll let them go. But what about her?" hesaid, pointing to Ozma. "She would be quite a delicacy.""Delicacy?" echoed Ozma. "I am not a delicacy. I am Ozma, Queen of Oz!"The marshmallow man looked at the child and giggled. "You are the Queenof something? Yeah, right! And I suppose that next you're going to tellme that mortal men will one day be able to travel to the moon and back.Ha! That's a laugh!""But it's true!" argued Elephant. "Ozma is the ruler of Oz.""Indeed," added Lisa. "I'll admit, I was also a little shaken when Ifirst learned that the Queen of Oz was a little girl. But you mustunderstand that Ozma is of Fairy descent. She is not like a mortal childat all. She has special abilities and powers that..."[Illustration: Elephant and others in Cages]"Silence!" shouted the marshmallow man. "I am not interested in hearingyour lies! This child is simply a tender and mouthwatering humandelicacy for the crocodiles to eat! That is all!" He looked at Ozma andlaughed. "Fairy descent? This is not a Fairy! I know about these things!Fairies are tiny little critters with wings like those on one of ourdragonflies. This is just a human child. A perfectly ordinary humanchild!"Ozma looked at him indignantly, but she said nothing more. She knew thatit would be hard to convince anyone of her origin without some sort ofproof. And, indeed, what would serve as sufficient proof to convincethis Doubting Thomas? She knew all too well that, throughout history,skeptics have always been known to cling to what they thought to betruth, even when it was a foolish belief that they were clinging to.Indeed, mortals in America had placed a great deal of faith in asubstance called radium. A highly radioactive and dangerous substance,radium was being treated as a miracle medicine that had been hailed as acure-all for anything! This marshmallow man was every bit assmall-minded as the mortal men. If she were going to prove her positionand power, she would have to break through the imaginary wall that hehad built up in his mind concerning the proper look of Queens andFairies."My good man," she said in her most dignified voice, "I can understandwhy you might assume what you do. It is true that I look more like alittle girl than the ruler of a vast country like Oz. And it is truethat some Fairy groups can be described as you have just suggested.However, it is also true that there are different kinds of Fairies, justas there are different kinds of marshmallows. The Fairy Queen Lurlinedoes not have wings, and she looks quite human, too. But if it is soimportant to you, I can probably meet with your needs in a satisfactorymanner." She put her fingers to her temples and concentrated."What are you doing?" asked the marshmallow man in puzzlement. Then:"Chicanery in Chittenango!" he exclaimed. "You have wings! But youdidn't have them a second or two ago!""Nor have I got them now," explained Ozma. "But I have made myselfappear to you as you would have me appear. Because I am a Fairy, I canmake myself look any way I please. But underneath, I am still the samelittle girl I have always been." The wings vanished again."But how can this be?" shuddered the marshmallow man."It is really very simple," explained Ozma. "When I first took thethrone of Oz, I had the same blonde hair that you see me with now. But Imight decide one day to be a brunette." Her hair suddenly changed coloras she spoke. "Or even a redhead." Again, the child's hair changedcolor. "Why, if I had a mind to, I could even make it green!" Again, herhair color changed. "You know, I think I might want to try being abrunette once in a while. Just for a change, you know. And if ever Imust meet with dignitaries from another country--especially one of thosenarrow-minded mortal lands, I think I might want to appear to them as anadult. But, of course, I like being youthful, so I will not really age.I will just make myself appear that way on occasion when the situationcalls for it."The marshmallow man fell to his marshmallow knees. "Forgive me, yourHighness!" he said. "You really are a Fairy! I most humbly apologize formy mistake. But you must admit, you really did look like a mere humanchild. How was I to know?""I don't think it should have mattered," said Elephant. "Do you reallyimagine that it is ever proper to feed any sentient being to acrocodile? Even a regular mortal child?""You are a wild animal," spoke the marshmallow man. "You should knowbetter than anyone that such is the way of survival. We do not want thecrocodiles to eat us, but we know that they must eat. I doubt that theywould be satisfied with tofu or falafel burgers, either. Thesecrocodiles are carnivorous, and they require fresh meat in order tosurvive. Would you have them become extinct?""He has a point," said Hootsey. "We really can't blame the crocodilesfor their metabolisms. But we can't allow them to eat our Queen,either!""Oh, no," said the marshmallow man. "Now that I know who she is, I haveno intention of feeding her to the crocodiles any more.""Nor any of my companions," said Ozma in a tone of voice that would nottolerate any argument. "But you do have a legitimate problem. You arecitizens of Oz, and therefore my subjects. I will not allow any of mysubjects to be threatened by any carnivorous crocodiles.""Then the crocodiles will not be able to survive," said Lisa sadly."But nothing can actually die anywhere in Oz," said Nibbles."Then they will grow horribly uncomfortable if they can't eat whatNature dictates they should," said Lisa. "I, for one, would rather diethan have a constant emptiness in my tummy or lack of energy due tomalnutrition.""Indeed," agreed Elephant. "To go hungry is a terrible fate. Isn't theresome alternative?""Nothing short of allowing the crocodiles to eat you," replied themarshmallow man."Then all is lost," sighed Hootsey. "Our benevolent ruler will have todecide who will be the recipient of her benevolence. It will have to bea choice between the carnivorous crocodiles or their natural source offood. One of the two must suffer.""How sad," said Lisa. "I had always heard that rulers and queens had atough job, but I had always doubted it. On the surface, it looks likequeens get to live in beautiful palaces with servants who meet all oftheir needs. And they are allowed to go to bed any time they like, oreat chocolate ice cream for breakfast if they wish. But now I begin tounderstand why their lives are so difficult. I sure wouldn't want tohave to make a decision like that. Basically, you'll be condemning anentire race to extinction--just like the dodo bird or thewinkledejimpker!""Couldn't we use criminals and thieves to feed to the crocodiles?"suggested Nibbles."I will not allow even them to be tortured this way," said Ozma. "Even athief deserves a chance to make up for his past misbehaving.""Then what can we do?" asked the marshmallow man."Hey!" said Elephant, suddenly having an idea. "There is a grove oftrees that grows near the Lunechien Forest. Some of the trees havefruits growing on them. Others have seed pods or alarm clocks or othersuch normal things that one always expects to find growing on trees. ButI think there are also a couple of ham and sausage trees there. I'll betthey would suffice for the crocodiles. Then they wouldn't have to eatany living creatures in order to satisfy their natural cravings.""A grand idea!" said the marshmallow man. "I have never heard of suchodd trees as those, but I'm sure the crocodiles will be thrilled tolearn that they no longer have to be hated and feared by their fellowbeings.""Of course," said Lisa. "No one wants to be feared. And if they are nowable to get their meat without any stalking or struggling, they mightneed some other form of exercise to keep from growing fat or sluggish. Ithink we should organize some group activities that will allow thecrocodiles and owls to interact together as friends.""And maybe Pinky and I could arrange a similar thing for us elephants toget together with them.""I think the mice would be a little too scared," shuddered Nibbles."Not after I have one of those ham trees transplanted in their marsh,"said Ozma. She turned to the marshmallow man. "Would you be willing totake charge of that?""Of course," he replied. "It will also make my own people live ingreater comfort to know that the crocodiles will never be hungry forthem again. But ... er, just out of curiosity, are there any marshmallowtrees around? Just to be on the safe side, you know."They all laughed.CHAPTER 10ALL ABOUT THE GILLIGOGGS AND THE DROFFSThe Droffs and the Gilligoggs had never understood each other. They werea different people, really. For example, the Droffs were shaggy-lookingcreatures with forms that resembled the Wooly Mammoth. They had shortsquat legs like tree trunks; short squat little bodies with arms tomatch, and heads that were too large for their bodies with eyes thatwere buried beneath long straggly shaggy fur. Their voices had a deepgruff sound not unlike a cave man might have sounded, and their wordscame out in a torrent of grunts that did not vary in tone and that didnot exactly follow the rules of grammar. For example: "Who you?" "Whatyou name?" "How got you this place?" "Why you here for?" etc. Whereasthe Gilligoggs were quite elegant--even sophisticated--compared to theDroffs. They were tall and slender, with long delicate fingers that theywaved expressively as they talked. They also had long hair but it was assoft and sweet smelling as the Droffs' hair was coarse and pungent.Their faces were feminine looking (even the males) with long curlingeyelashes, delicately chiseled features, full lips, etc. The onlyperceptible difference between the males and females was that the males'voices were a little deeper, and they were a little taller.Anyway, as you can imagine, two peoples that were so different had verylittle love for one another. Why this should be I do not know, exceptthat people with different appearances seem to distrust each other, evenwhen there has been no physical aggression between them. Neither groupwould willingly mix with the other either socially or even live in theother's neighborhood. Each race pretty much kept to itself.I suppose that in a way, the Gilligoggs looked down on the Droffs. Theyconsidered them somehow inferior to themselves. The Droffs were wellaware of this and were deeply resentful. Now if you or I were to try toanalyze the exact reason for this, we might fall short of our goal. Wecould say that the Gilligoggs were far more intelligent because theirspeech was more sophisticated. But if you took the trouble to get toknow a Droff, you would find that, in spite of their crude manner ofspeech, they are, as a whole, equally as intelligent as the Gilligoggs,except that they express their intelligence in a different way. Anotherargument might be that the Droffs were not nearly so sweet smelling incomparison. Now, this may be true in one way, but in actual fact, theDroffs had just as high a standard of personal hygiene as theGilligoggs. It was just that the Gilligoggs' olfactory senses weresensitive to the natural scent of the Droffs (just as the Droffs'olfactory senses were equally sensitive to the natural scent of theGilligoggs). And while neither group found the other offensive in thisway, they could detect a difference, albeit on a subconscious level.Another argument might be that the Droffs had lower social standardsthan the Gilligoggs. This argument, too, has to fall by the wayside. Forreasons that we will not go into here, the Droffs had had difficulty inkeeping up with the Joneses, so to speak. Due to circumstances beyondtheir control, they had not done quite as well on a socioeconomic scale.So there you have it. And this was the situation that Elephant and hispals were confronted with after their excursion with the Marshmallowpeople. As they continued on their way to the home of the Saber-ToothedLight-Bulbs, they hardly expected yet another interruption. But ithappened all the same. A particularly tall and attractive Gilligoggwoman who looked to be about sixteen approached them. She had dark hairthat glistened in the sunlight in a particularly gorgeous manner whichreminded Lisa of fine silk."Greetings," said Ozma to the young lady. Even though she was notanxious to be interrupted again, she was always polite to her people.She knew that, in order to be a good ruler for the land of Oz, sheshould be aware of the individual needs of all of the Ozites."Good morrow," came the reply. The lady's voice was like music.Beautiful music such as is usually reserved only for the Fairies, angelsor gods. So in awe of this lovely lady were our adventurers that onlyOzma found her voice which, though beautiful in its own youthful manner,did not hold a candle to that of this Gilligogg lady."I am Ozma, the Queen of Oz," said the little girl. "My friends and Iare on our way to enlist the help of some people who live beyond yourterritory. I hope you won't mind if we pass through your lovelycountry.""You are the Queen," said the lady. "I am only a princess. Far be itfrom me to tell you what you can or can not do." She seemeddisinterested as she spoke. "My name is Dianna, and my father is theruler of the Gilligoggs." If this young lady felt any doubt that Ozmawas indeed a queen, she did not let on. Indeed, she seemed unconcernedas to the identity of her queen. "But I shall tell you that theGilligoggs are the only people in this region. We are all that is here.Well, unless you count the Droffs. But you could not be looking for theDroffs. They are so far beneath your station.""Oh, no," sighed Tweaty. "I think we are about to get stuck in themiddle of another time-consuming battle like the Stinkfoot and Snifferwar! This will not be a good thing for any of the Lunechien Forestdenizens. Why, for all we know, that Forest Monster may already havedestroyed all of our friends and neighbors back home!""There is no war here," said Dianna matter-of-factly. "We Gilligoggs areabove such barbarous practices. Why, if I had to fight, I might break afingernail. But we do wish that the Droffs would go away. So long asthey are about, the property value on our homes must surely be going waydown."[Illustration Ozma and a Droff]"My my!" said Elephant. "Are these Droffs some sort of frightfulmonsters, like the Kalidahs?""They are worse," said Dianna with a most elegant and sophisticatedshudder. "They look like... Well, actually they look a lot like you,only they are all hairy and vulgar. You, at least, are not covered withall that coarse fur. Still, I wonder if you might be related to them."She took a nail file from her pocket and looked at her hands in anuninterested manner."So then, they are elephants?" asked Nibbles."Shaggy elephants?" tweeted Tweaty."Wooly mammoths?" questioned Lisa and Hootsey together."Neither of those," replied the princess. "They are just Droffs.""We did not come to seek the Droffs," said Ozma. "Nor did we come to seethe Gilligoggs. We were looking for the Saber-Toothed Light-Bulbs. Arethey not in this area?""They are," said Hootsey with certainty. "I know they are.""Perhaps," said the young lady. "Perhaps they are among the Droffs. I donot know of them. Nor do I especially care to. They might beunpleasant.""But how can you know whether or not they are pleasant if you refuseeven to see them?""Best to be safe," said Dianna. "Why invite trouble? We Gilligoggs havealways known that we are superior to all other living beings, so weavoid contact with anyone else. If we start to invite trouble, we'resure to get it in great doses.""But that's awful!" put in Tweaty. "You don't even give them a chance?""Why should we? They are not Gilligoggs. Heavens! They have the mostoutlandish-looking noses!" She eyed Elephant in a scrutinizing manner."I think I should like to meet these Droffs," harrumphed Elephant."Then by all means please leave as quickly as you can," said Dianna. "Iwould not want my people to have to gaze upon anyone who would associatewith Droffs. They are messy things at best. I had offered you a greathonor in speaking to you, but you obviously do not appreciate it. Hadthe dross not been with you, Miss Queen of Oz, I should not have evenacknowledged them. Good day to you..." So saying, the princess walkedaway without looking back.Our six adventurers hurried through the Gilligogg territory. Few of theGilligoggs even stopped to look at them as they passed through. Beforelong, they came upon a creature who looked a good deal like Elephant,and who was obviously a Droff."Hey," said the Droff. "Who you am?""I am Ozma, Queen of Oz," said the child."You much good to be here," replied the Droff. "Me are called Biff. Whois them?"Each of the five Lunechiens introduced himself."Me likes Elephant lots," said Biff. "Him look like Droff, but smooth.Him might relative to me I. Maybe like Droff. Ozma Queen and others likeeat? Droffs no have much, but share. Me have oatmeal with much gravy.For nice Queen, me even serve with sprinkles. Me likes Queen lots, andElephant. Have good seeds for birdies, too. Mouse want cheese? Me havesSwiss. Usually only haves Swiss on Sunday. It is holey. But for friendof good and nice Queen, me get some for nice little mouse.""How kind," said Nibbles. "Thank you."The Droff, though not as graceful as he might have been, served up arepast that was happily received by his guests."The Droffs are obviously more hospitable than the Gilligoggs," saidTweaty."Gilligoggs?" echoed Biff. "You am knowing Gilligoggs?""We just passed through their country on our way here," explained Lisa."Me wish me knew Gilligoggs," sighed Biff. "Them not let Droffs passthrough. Not come to visit Droffs, neither. To Gilligogg, Droff landjust place to dump stuff they no want.""Stuff?" asked Ozma. "What stuff?""Old stuff, most," replied the Droff. "Rotted foods. Old packages.Cigarette ends. You am knowing. Stuff.""What slobs!" said Lisa with distaste. "And that princess had the nerveto say that Droffs were messy!""But it explains why the Droffs have such low-quality land," sighedOzma. "It isn't that the Droffs are unsanitary. The very reason theGilligoggs look down on the Droffs is caused by the Gilligoggsthemselves!""They are high and sophisticated, I guess," added Hootsey. "But theirrefusal to see what they are doing to the world around them has madethem into a life form that is most undesirable. They have madethemselves become exactly what they dislike in others.""Me thinks that is not Gilligogg's fault," said Biff, defending hisneighbors. "Me has seen that all hatred do that lots. If you hatesomething so bad that you try to be away from it a lot, you start to beturning into it you self. Me not like hate. Me hate hate mosthatefulishly.""Yes," agreed Lisa. "When knowledge is used for cruel purposes, there isno knowledge any more. Both sides end up losers. I think the Gilligoggscould learn a lot from the Droffs.""Me thank you, owl bird," said Biff with a smile. "You am nice. Me likesyou.""Me likes ... I mean, I like you, too," said Lisa. "Now tell me, do youknow of the Saber-Toothed Light-Bulbs?""Light-Bulbs?" echoed Biff. "Not know. Not do. Maybe friend know ofthat, though. Friend are much smart and also wise. Him have good anduseful glass head. Him and him's people living close nearby. Them haveseen much.""Hmmm," said Ozma. "Have them got large, sharp teeth?""Oh, yes!" said Biff. "Much good for opening packages! Much nice,friends are. You be liking Droffs' friends. Me can take pretty queen andnice Elephant and friends to see Droffs' friend as shortly as you amfinishing eatings. Me can show to other Droffs, too.""I would like that very much," said Ozma. "I think I will like theDroffs just fine.""And them would be liking you," said Biff with certainty.As soon as the visitors finished eating, the kindly Droff led them to anadjacent valley wherein they saw bright lights. These, as Hootseyexplained, were the Saber-Toothed Light Bulbs themselves. From adistance, they looked pretty much like ordinary light bulbs. But as ourlittle party drew closer, they could see the individuality of eachSaber-Toothed Light Bulb. One of the larger Light Bulbs saw themapproaching and lit up. "Look, fellows!" he said. "It's Biff! And he hasbrought some friends along!""Hi, Watts!" said Biff to the light bulb. "Me is so happy to seeing you!Me haves the Queen of Oz here, too. Her wants to meet you. Her are muchgood and nice. You are liking her?""Of course," replied Watts. "Any friend of Biff's is a friend of mine!"He extended one of his long appendages to the small queen. She took itin her hand. "It is a pleasure," said Watts to Ozma. "I had heard thatOz had a new queen. I am glad to see that you are a kind-looking one.""Thank you," said Ozma."So what can I do for you?" asked Watts, quickly realizing that therehad to be some sort of business that had brought the queen to see him."Well," began Ozma, not sure just how to begin her explanation, "theLunechien Forest of Oz has come upon a problem.""Oh, no!" said Watts. "That's awful! What kind of a problem?""It seems that there is a terrible monster that is threatening our fineforest," she began. "A very large spider-like creature.""Sounds beastly!" shuddered the light bulb."And he can sap away the energy from any living creature and render himan empty shell of himself," added Tweaty."My!" said Watts. "That does sound like a problem! Is there anything Ican do to help? If you need to move away from this monster, you arewelcome to join us. The Droffs and the Saber-Toothed Light-Bulbs are notcrowded in. We can make room.""That is very kind of you," said the ruler. "But I was hoping that maybeyou could come and stand up to the Forest Monster. No one else can doit. Even I would hesitate to approach them. But I know that you could doit. How could any foe of any size stand against you?""You want us to fight this Forest Monster?" said Watts fearfully."Well," sighed Ozma. "I am not usually in favor of such cruelty. I wouldbe sorry to harm him. But I am left with little choice. Already he istoo strong to be reckoned with. I have been a queen for only a shorttime. I do have fairy powers, but am not anxious to face the ForestMonster myself. If you could at least back me up while I try to reasonwith him...""Don't waste your time," said Tweaty. "You can't reason with that thing.It will bite you in half before you get past the greeting.""Say," interjected Hootsey. "Maybe that isn't so. We have already seenOzma do some amazing things. She can change the color of her hair, forexample. Maybe she could use some of her fairy magic to scare away thespider! Why, if she can change her physical form, she could easilybecome a Giant or a Kalidah!"Ozma looked fearful. "I'm not sure I'd want to try that," she said. "Imight just make him all the more angry. He may already have more powerthan we think he has. But you do have a point. I do have some powersthat I should try to make use of. Having only been a fairy for a shorttime, I'm not altogether sure what powers I may have at my disposal.Alas, I was the boy Tip for so long that I have not had much practicebeing Ozma yet.""You could practice some magic on me," said Tweaty, trying to behelpful. "Maybe you can turn the Forest Monster into a pumpkin orsomething. I don't mind if you practice on me, so long as you put meback the way I'm supposed to be.""That sounds like a good idea," agreed the Saber-Toothed Light-Bulb."But still, I'm happy to come along to back you up. That way, if I amneeded, I'll be there. If I am not needed after all, I will still havehad a nice bit of travel to write about in my journal.""You are very kind," said the little Queen. "And I am sure that I mustpractice using my powers a lot more than I already have. This will be agood learning experience for me, and can only make me a better ruler forthe land of Oz." She put her hands to her temples and concentrated onthe canary."Am I changing?" asked the bird."You look the same to me," answered Lisa."I need my Silver Wand," said Ozma. "That often helps me while I'mgaining prowess at a new spell." She had the magical tool with her, soshe took it from its case and made a number of intricate passes in theair with it. Still, Tweaty failed to change."Maybe there are some words you're supposed to say while you're doingyour magic spell?" wondered Elephant."Yes," said Ozma as a Light-Bulb jumped over her head. "I think you'reright! Let me think.... I should know the word." She again put her handsto her head and concentrated. "Haamhaamkablams-w," she said in achanting voice. "Haamhaamkablams-w."Tweaty began to change in form and substance. Within moments, he hadtaken on the shape of a housecat. He still had his yellow feathers,however. "Awk!" he said. "Look what you did to me! This is the worstpossible form to place on a canary! Turn me back! Please turn me back!""I meant to make you a pumpkin," sighed Ozma. "But this is still new tome. I will try again."This time, Tweaty became an orange elephant. He was no larger than hehad been as a cat, but his shape was very clearly that of a pachyderm."How cute!" said Elephant. "You look like me, only smaller and oranger!""Yeah," said Tweaty. "I guess I do. But I'm not sure this is going towork on the Forest Monster. If you were to change him into anothersentient animal, he'd just go back and do it all over again. You mustturn him into something inanimate. But please, this is veryuncomfortable. I'm used to being able to fly at will, and this formseems so ... so ungainly. No offense, Elephant. I think you make aterrific elephant. But I make a lousy one.""But you do make a wonderful bird," agreed the pachyderm. "Yes, Ozma, doput him back the way he was. As adorable as he is, he isn't exactly amodel specimen of my race.""Of course," said Ozma, again raising her Silver Wand. She did her spellonce more. This time, nothing happened. "I am sorry," sighed Ozma. "I amalready feeling exhausted. I'm afraid I will have to wait a while beforeI can do it again.""You mean," said Tweaty, "I have to look like this until you are able torest up?""I'm afraid so," said Ozma sadly. "I'm sure that will change as I growmore experienced. You have to remember, I am only beginning to get mysea-legs as a fairy. Once I am more proficient, I'm sure I'll be able todo things like this all day long without becoming exhausted. Just giveme time.""And in the meantime I have to look like a little orange elephant,"sighed Tweaty. "I'm sure glad my mother can't see me right now!""But Tweaty's not the main issue right this minute," said Watts. "Notthat I am unsympathetic with his feelings or anything like that, but Ido sense a certain degree of urgency at getting to your Forest Monsterquickly. I'm sure that all of the Saber-Toothed Light-Bulbs will behappy to go and see what we can do. We are always anxious to help goodfolks like yourselves. And even though it isn't something I'm terriblyproud of, I can be very ferocious when I have a mind to be." As if toprove his statement, Watts opened his mouth as wide as he could,revealing the sharpest-looking teeth Ozma had ever seen. Indeed, histeeth resembled sabres, which may have been the reason for their title.Elephant shuddered in his skin. "I'm sure that a few of you would aptlyfrighten the Forest Monster out of our forest," he said tremblingly."Hopefully out of Oz altogether!""Splendid," replied Watts. "Come, follow me. I know a short-cut thatwill allow us to avoid the Gilligoggs. Not that I am afraid of theGilligoggs or anything. I just find them unpleasant to have to dealwith. Come this way, and we will soon be on our way to the LunechienForest of Oz!"CHAPTER 11...AND HE SHOWS THEM PEARLY WHITESAs the little group, together with a party of five of the Saber-ToothedLight-Bulbs, turned a bend in the road, they came upon a huge dried seabed. They could see for miles, and there was not a soul in sight."I think we're in uncharted territory," remarked Elephant, peering intothe distance. "I don't remember anyone ever mentioning this. But itlooks safe enough to cross. No more unpleasant surprises, I'm sure."At that moment a deep disembodied voice said, "Dinnah iss serffed,laddies and lassies, pliss shtep oop to da table."Everyone turned around to see who was speaking, but could see no one.Suddenly, several mounds of sand that they had not noticed before beganto quiver and slowly rise a couple of feet above the ground. The moundsshook themselves and the sand fell off to reveal about fifty _GreatWhite Sharks_. They were not suspended above the ground as it firstseemed, but were supported with legs like an alligator.This was a frightening scene to behold, as you can well imagine. Andwhen their leader approached our heroes, he repeated the words "Dinnahiss serffed," and licked his lips with anticipation.He spoke again in that very strange accent, this time addressingElephant: "Vatt iss a madder vi' chew? You nebber seen land sharks'afore?""N-N-N-No, w-w-w-we h-h-h-haven't," stuttered Elephant."Habben chew?" the leader said, winking at his friends. "Den ah villshare some knowletch vi' chew to take vi' chew to da hereafter. (Theother sharks roared with laughter at this). Ven our ocean dried oopmillons off yearss ago, all da fishies died, includen uss sharks--exceptfor two, zat iss. Undt dare chilluns ver born vi' liddle leggies. Vearrda descendants off dose two, undt ve haff effolved over da yearss toour present selfs. Fully adapted to da land. Undt ve haff kept alive alldeess yearss on a steady diet off hunsuspecting helaffant. So vat chew'tink 'bout zat?""N-n-not t-t-too m-m-much," answered Elephant in a high pitched voice."I-I mean, I d-d-d-don't know wh-what t-to think.""Tell chew vat ve do," said the shark. "Chew seem like nice a guyss. Veno eat chew tonight. Ve eat chew tomorrow--fer break'ast."[Illustration: Land Sharks]All the sharks laughed uproariously, whereupon they surrounded ourheroes and promptly lay back down in the sand and went to sleep."Well," said Watts. "This is a fine how-do-you-do. But I don't think wehave to worry about these guys too much. I seriously doubt they couldeat glass, so we can protect the rest of you." He smiled a very sharptoothy smile. "Besides, they seem to be very lazy. It isn't like they'veenclosed us in a cage or anything like that. What's to stop us fromsimply slipping out between two of them and walking away?""Ahh am," came a rumbling voice. "Ahh am ze vatchman uff ze Land Sharks.But chew do have a point. Ve cannot eat glass. Ve can break it, but vecan't eat it. Chew are uff no value to us. Ve vill only be able to eatze meat creatchures. Chew that are a made from glass may go."Watts and his friends made their most ferocious faces at the LandSharks. "You will allow us all to go!" said Watts to the Shark. "Youwill not hold any of us back! Besides, we have with us the Queen of Oz.Your own Queen, for crying out loud!""Chew does have some pretty teeth, don' chew?" said the watchman. "But Iam not afraid of chew, zo chew should leave now. I do not know chust'zactly vat a queen might be, but I am sure that it iss delissious.""We do not have time for this," hooted Lisa. "We are on an importantmission to save the Lunechien Forest of Oz from a gigantic ForestMonster, and you had better not hold us back! The Forest Monster isalready bigger than the lot of you, and he will come for you sooner orlater if you don't let us stop him!""Vorest Monzter?" echoed the great shark."That's what I said," replied Lisa angrily."Chust vat iss ze Vorest Monzter made uff?" asked the shark."Er, I don't know. Whatever monsters are usually made of," answered thefemale owl. "Flesh and blood, I guess.""Und he iss ass big ass chew zay he iss?" asked the shark."Probably bigger by now," put in Tweaty, realizing what was happening."Zen ve shall eat ziss Vorest Monzter!" said the shark. "Ve shall eathim 'til he iss only bones!"Lisa was not entirely sure the Forest Monster had any bones, as shesuspected that spiders had exoskeletons instead, but she saw no reasonto bring this up at the moment. "Then you really don't need us. It isagainst the laws of the jungle to kill more than you can eat, and theForest Monster will easily tide you over for a good long time."Ozma was not quite happy with the way things were turning out. She wasnot an advocate of killing at all. The thought of her willingly placingone of her subjects--even one so wicked as the Forest Monster--in mortaldanger was a hard pill for her to swallow. Still, this development hadapparently removed the threat to her own hide. "Then we shall be on ourway," she said. "I will wish you a good night."The shark thanked her and, having no one left that he had to guard,settled down to sleep among his fellows."This is odd," said Ozma as the group continued on its way. "We set outto rid ourselves of the Forest Monster, and now I feel inclined to findhim so that we can warn him of his pending danger.""You are kidding, aren't you?" asked Watts.Ozma only looked solemnly at the ground and kept walking.CHAPTER 12THE LION KINGNow, when the Cowardly Lion of Oz had first tangled with and beheadedthe Forest Monster, the other animals of the area had named him theirking. They had since come to recognize Ozma as the overall ruler of Oz,but they joyfully accepted their tawny savior as their local leader.The Cowardly Lion had taken to the job as well as any coward could beexpected to do. He knew that, when he had accepted this position ofpower, he also took on a responsibility. The other animals were now hissubjects, and he felt it was his duty to protect them from outsidedangers such as hunters or other predators. He also thought it politicto offer his advice whenever one of his new charges had a question or aproblem. It was one such event that is pertinent to this part of ourstory. About a week prior to Queen Ozma's meeting with the Land Sharks,a young wombat had come to the Cowardly Lion to ask his advice."Hello," said the smaller creature. "Your majesty, Mr. Cowardly Lion,Sir?""Yes?" replied the Lion, looking around to see where the voice had comefrom. "W-who's that? W-who said th-that?" When his large eyes came uponthe wombat, he seemed to smile. "Why, Ricardo, there you are. I didn'tsee you at first. How are you doing?""Okay, I guess," said the wombat."And your mother?" added the Lion."She's fine," said Ricardo."I am very happy to hear it," said the Cowardly Lion. "But tell me, myfriend, why you seem so glum. A boy your age shouldn't have anyproblems that would cause such glumness. What's wrong?"[Illustration: Cowardly Lion and Wombat]"Weeeeell," began the wombat slowly. "It's kind of silly, I guess. But Iwanted to ask your advice about something.""You think it's silly to ask my advice?" said the Cowardly Lion,pretending to be hurt."No, that's not what I meant," replied Ricardo. "I mean, what I wantedto ask you about is kind of silly. I'm not sure it would be right towaste your time on. I think I should leave now ..." He turned to leave."Now now," said the Lion, becoming serious again. "No problem that istroubling one of my subjects is silly. Nor is it a waste of my time tohear the needs of today's youth. What's troubling you, my boy?""Well," began Ricardo, "you see ... well, I have this friend ...""Oh, it's about a friend is it?" said the Cowardly Lion knowingly."Oh, no," said Ricardo. "I'm not trying to pass the buck. It really isabout a friend of mine. You see, he's a real copy cat. He likes to doeverything I do, and he does it exactly the same way, and it's drivingme wom-batty. I want to tell him to think for himself, but I'm not surehow to go about it.""So what is it that he does that you don't want him to do?" asked theLion. "I mean, if he is doing exactly as you are, you must be having agood time together. Aren't you?""No, I mean, like ... Like last week I found a really neat shiny rockthat I thought I would like to keep. I took it home with me, and whenHenry saw it, he went out and got one that was just like it.""Is that bad?" asked the Lion. "The rocks are there for everyone to useas they need them. What's the matter with that?""And when I made a welcome mat for my mom to put in front of our home,Henry went and made one like it for his mom! It's like he can't think ofanything for himself. He has to use all of my ideas. I wish he wouldfind his own means of expressing himself, instead of always stealing myideas. It's like, I learned a new song that I was going to sing atwombat school, and then Henry went and learned it, too!"The Cowardly Lion looked at Ricardo and seemed to smile again. "Ah,Ricardo," he said. "I think your little friend is doing it out ofaffection for you. Imitation, after all, is the highest form offlattery--well, next to bringing you food, at least. I think your friendjust admires you so much that he wants to be just like you.""Really?" said Ricardo. "Gee whiz, I hadn't thought about that. Ithought it was just that he refused to think for himself. Or maybe thathe felt I didn't deserve to have anything he didn't. Or that he simplywanted to drive me insane. But maybe you're right. He does seem to liketo hang around with me a lot. Maybe he just wants to imitate me becausehe admires me! That's pretty neat!""Yes it is," said the Cowardly Lion. "So you have a responsibility toHenry now as a role model.""A what?" asked Ricardo."A role model," explained the Lion. "If Henry is going to do everythingyou do, you certainly don't want to do anything too foolish.""Oh, yeah," agreed Ricardo. "That's true. Thanks for your advice, Mr.Lion King, Sir.""Any time, Ricardo," laughed the Lion. "Be sure to give my respects toyour mother.""I will," said the wombat, scampering off happily and chanting somethingunder his breath about being a role model."If only the problems of the adults were as easily handled as that,"laughed the King."Mr. Your Majesty?" came another voice. "I want to ask you some advice."The Cowardly Lion looked and saw another wombat. "Aha," he said. "Let meguess. Your name is Henry, right?""Gee," replied the smaller animal. "You know my name! You must knoweverything!""I do," said the Lion jokingly. "And I had a feeling that you'd be alongsoon. So what's troubling you?""Oh, it's nothing much. I just really wanted to come and talk to you.""I see," laughed the King. "You are friends with Ricardo, are you not?"The little wombat's eyes seemed to grow out of their sockets. "Youreally know everything! You really do! I'm sorry I cheated on my lastspelling test. I promise I'll never do it again!"The Cowardly Lion was a little taken aback by this statement, but hecovered it well. "I was going to bring that up if you didn't," he lied."You must tell your teacher and make up the test if you want to grow upto be a king like me.""Oh, I will!" agreed Henry. "I will go and tell her right now!" Hedashed off toward the wombat schoolyard."And so I am now a psychic," laughed the Lion. "Next I'll be expectedto be able to fly or to leap over tall buildings in a single bound. ButI guess it's all part of being a king. And I have to show my subjectsthat I am a good king, so I must do my best to be all that they expectme to be. I've got to be strong, and try to hang on. I have to be kindand understanding toward their needs. And most of all, I have to bebrave!" He let out a practice roar that shook the very ground beneathhis paws. "I am a brave lion! I am the King of the Beasts! I am fearedby all, and I fear nothing! I am brave and I am..." As a grasshopperleaped in front of him, the Lion nearly jumped out of his skin."Aaaaaah!" he cried. "What is it? What'd I see? I saw something move!"Another grasshopper jumped in the air, and the Lion, that strong andcourageous King of all Beasts, bravely turned tail and ran.CHAPTER 13THE COWARDLY LION AND THE FOREST MONSTER OF OZThe Cowardly Lion ran and ran. He had no idea just how long or how farhe had gone when he stopped to catch his breath."This sort of cowardice is sure to make me old before my time," he saidto himself.As he settled down in a pile of leaves for a short rest, he heardsomething rustling in the bushes nearby. "Wha--" he said. "What's that?Who's there?""D-don't hurt me, Mr. Lion," came a voice."W-who are you?" shivered the Lion.By way of an answer, a small brown monkey with shaggy fur walked slowlyout of the brush. "P-please don't eat me, Mr. Lion," he said fearfully."Don't worry," replied the Cowardly Lion. "I had no intention of doingso. What were you doing in the bushes?""I heard you coming, and I was afraid," explained the simian."I can identify with that," said the Lion with a smile."I was afraid that you might be one of those awful spider-creatures thatsaps away the energy from everyone else," continued the monkey. "But Ican see that you are not. You are a much nicer fellow than that. I thinkI've seen a portrait of you somewhere, in fact. You are ... My oh my!Can it be true? You're him, aren't you?""Who?" asked the big cat."You are the great Lion that defeated the Forest Monster before!" saidthe monkey. "I'm sure of it! What other lion in Oz is so big? Aren't youthe one who is called the Cowardly Lion of Oz?""Yeah," said the Lion, not especially proud of the title, but happy thathe was so famous with even this small monkey that he had never seenbefore. "That's right. I am the Cowardly Lion of Oz. It is a title thatis far more honest than flattering. And who might you be?""I am Cubby," said the monkey. "I live in the Lunechien Forest of Oz.""Lunechien Forest?" echoed the Lion. I'm not sure just where that is. Isit far from here?""Pretty far," sighed Cubby. "I was running away.""Running away?" replied the Lion, whose advice-giving nature wasbeginning to surface. "Now, dear little Cubby, my lad. Whatever problemsyou may be having at home are no reason to run away. You can't run awayfrom your problems. You should go back and try to talk it out. Why, Ican...""You don't understand," said Cubby. "I wasn't running away like a childwho has had a disagreement with his parents over a cookie or something.I was running for my life.""Oh," replied the Cowardly Lion. "Well then, that's a whole differentball of wax. If you were ... Huh? What? You were running for your life?What do you mean?""The Forest Monster has been sucking the energy out of all of theanimals of the Lunechien Forest, and I know he was coming for me next! Iwas so afraid, I just wanted to get away from there as swiftly as Icould. Then, when I heard your heavy breathing, I thought it was theForest Monster coming for me. I thought for sure I was a goner.""The Forest Monster?" echoed the Lion. "But I don't understand. I had arun-in with him once myself. I knocked his head off while he wassleeping. I know it was hardly sporting to do it that way, and I am alittle ashamed that I didn't even give him a sporting chance, but I haveto think of the innocent beasts whose lives were at stake."[Illustration: Cowardly Lion and Cubby]"I think there may be more than one," said Cubby. "Unless the one youfought somehow got himself repaired.""I suspect that would h-have to be the case," stammered the CowardlyLion. "I d-don't think there could be more than one of those creatures.I had assumed it was created by magic, sort of like a green elephant orsomething. But if it is alive again, it will probably find out who itwas that defeated it before. It will be looking for me.""I'm afraid it already knows who you are," spoke Cubby. "And it hasfound a way to take the energy from other beings and use it for itself.It is already so powerful that I doubt anyone could stand against it."He paused. "Oh, except for you, of course. I know you could defeat it.You did it before.""Er, yeah," said the Lion, his eyes growing to several times theirnormal size. "I g-guess I d-did. B-but he was so much easier to tacklewhen he was asleep. Now that he has multiplied his power, I'm n-notsure I c-could do it again.""Oh, but you can! You must," said the monkey encouragingly. "You can'tlet him keep getting stronger and stronger! Sooner or later, he willfind you. And he probably won't stop at that. He may cross the desertand go into the mortal lands. He might start attacking Ix or Mo or evenMerryland! And then he may infiltrate the mortal lands like America,where your friend Dorothy lives!""D-Dorothy?" said the Lion, suddenly looking more angry than afraid."She's just a little kid! He wouldn't do that to a child?""He did it to several of the small and helpless beasts in the LunechienForest," said the simian. "Even insects are not safe from him.""Well, he is a spider, as far as that goes," replied the Cowardly Lion."Insects are a normal diet for him. But small children are not! How darehe even think of hurting little Dorothy? What a wicked creature hereally is! Where is he? Let me have a talk with this nasty arachnid!""That's the spirit!" cheered Cubby. "Come on, let's go!"The Lion had already forgotten about his exhausted condition. Thethought of Dorothy being in danger had taken precedence over all otherthoughts in his head. He followed Cubby closely until he felt he had torest. They traveled and rested for as long as it took before at lastthey reached the border of the Lunechien Forest of Oz."I sure hope we can find him in his sleep again," whispered the Lion tohimself."Come on," said Cubby. "I know where his lair is. If he hasn't moved onto more densely populated territory, that is.""W-wouldn't it be rude to just b-barge in on him?" said the Lion, hiscowardly nature suddenly returning."I don't think so," replied Cubby. "I think we need to stop his wickeddeeds as soon as we possibly can. We can't let him get to Dorothy, youknow. Nor the Scarecrow or the Tin Woodman or the Woggle-Bug. No one issafe as long as the Forest Monster is at large.""You're right!" said the Cowardly Lion dutifully. "We are the only oneswho can stop him. Where is this overgrown daddy long legs?"Cubby led the huge animal through the forest to the lair of the giganticspider. When they got there, they were met with a most unexpected sight.There was a pack of Land Sharks. They looked frightful and hungry, andthey surrounded Ozma, Tweaty, Nibbles, Lisa, Hootsey and Elephant."Those are some of my friends who live in this forest," explained Cubby."Except for the little girl. I don't know who she is. Is that Dorothy?""No," said the Lion, his voice sounding hollow. "What is she doing here?Why are your friends here? They should have followed your act and fled.""It iss dinnah time!" shouted one of the Land Sharks. "I believe veshall bekin vith ze big gray helefantt!""No!" said Cubby. "Don't let them do it!"The Cowardly Lion trembled with fear as he watched the huge Land Sharkturn to face the little monkey. When the Shark moved toward Cubby withits jagged teeth exposed, he pounced on it."Get ziss kitty offa my back!" screamed the Land Shark. "It hass sharpclawss, und zay are hurtin' me!"The Lion jumped off, and the impact of his jump knocked the Land Sharkover. To tell the truth, the Land Shark's legs were rather thin, and hisbalance was not very good to begin with. This displayed to the othersthe Land Sharks' main weakness. Thinking quickly on his feet, Elephantraced toward another of the Sharks and knocked it over on its face. TheShark's front teeth were dislodged, and it ran behind its fellows.Without its teeth, the Land Shark was much more vulnerable than it hadbeen previously. Seeing that the other Land Sharks were distracted bythe Lion and Elephant, the Forest Monster took its opportunity tostrike. Within moments, the Land Shark was no longer a threat to anyone,having been drained of all of its life force. The added burst of energygave the Forest Monster more ability to take out more of the LandSharks. But he was so preoccupied that he failed to notice Watts and hisfour companions surround him with their ferocious teeth bared. Thiscaused the Forest Monster to hesitate while he sized up the situation.Here he was, the bad guy, trying to get bigger and stronger at theexpense of the Land Sharks, yet at the same time inadvertently savingOzma and her friends, and now Ozma's forces were bearing down on himwhile his back was turned. "Hey! This is grossly unfair," he said,almost crying. Just then, a group of Droffs, accompanied by severalSniffers and Stinkfoots, arrived. The confusion allowed Ozma to use hersilver wand to cast a spell. Between the Forest Monster, Elephant, theStinkfoots, Sniffers and the Cowardly Lion, the Land Sharks weredisabled within a matter of forty-five minutes. Those who had not beendeenergized by the Forest Monster or otherwise rendered harmless by oneof the others had fallen to their spindly knees and were pleading formercy. One was staring directly into the foot of one of the newcomersand crying hysterically. All the while, Ozma had been using her wand toturn the Sharks into tiny snails, which Cubby picked up and put into anearby pond."It is finished," said the Cowardly Lion. He pushed his aching body tothe ground and licked one of his wounds. "The Land Sharks are subdued. Idon't think they will have the same cruel spirits now that they aresnails.""Indeed not," said the Forest Monster. Turning to the Cowardly Lion, headded, "You fought bravely. For one who is called Cowardly, youcertainly didn't show any signs of having earned that title in thisbattle.""But I felt them," sighed the Lion. "I was only acting brave because Isaw my friends in danger. To tell you the truth, I was scared out of mywits the whole time.""Your friends?" echoed the Forest Monster. "You call us your friends?Even me? Do you not remember who I am, and what you once did to me whileI was sleeping?"The Lion did a double take. "Oh, yeah! I was so caught up in the battlewith the Land Sharks that I forgot what I had come here for.""I was, too!" agreed Cubby. "But the Cowardly Lion was coming here tohave a talk with you," he added, remembering the words that the Lion hadspoken to him earlier. "He said that he was ashamed of what he did toyou without giving you a sporting chance." These last words on Cubby'spart were intended only as an observation. He had no idea that theywould have any effect on the Forest Monster at all."Is that so?" wondered the huge spider. "You mean to say that you camehere to apologize to me? And you even counted me among your friends. Howwrong I have been in my assessment of your character. You are not socowardly after all. In fact, I feel proud to have fought alongside ofyou. I would like to start over and get to know you for what you reallyare."The Lion was taken aback. "You would?" he said. He had no idea what elseto say. He had come to the Lunechien Forest thinking that he was to facethe greatest enemy he had ever known, and that enemy was speaking to himas if they were old friends who had just met after a long period ofseparation."Of course I would," said the spider. "I see now that I was wrong tohate you so badly when I didn't even know what sort of fellow you reallywere. And seeing how I felt when we were attacked by those Land Sharkswithout having any way to fight them off showed me how grossly unfair Iwas for having taken the energy from helpless insects and animals. I wasas bad as them, and I don't ever want to be like that again! It's muchtoo frightful. I'd rather have a solid group of friends than have allthe power in the world.""I think I am guilty of the same thing," sighed the Lion, still a littlespooked by the abruptness of the Monster's turnabout in nature. "Iknocked your head off as you slept, but I didn't know what you werelike, either. All I knew was what I was told: that you were eating allof the lions and the other animals, and that they wanted to make metheir king if I stopped you.""So you are their king now," said the Forest Monster. "I do not begrudgeyou the position any more. You are welcome to it. I suddenly feel like Idon't care for any position of power any more. When I was gaining thepower I now possess, I was allowing myself to be blind to anything butmy ever-growing hatred of you. Now that I see how unfounded that hatredreally was, I feel that it was I who was the true coward. I was sappingthe life energy from countless helpless creatures. I did not give themany sporting chance, either. Nor did I have any excuse to justify what Iwas doing except that I wanted revenge. It is I who should feel ashamedof himself, not you. Now I have all of this power and strength that wasbrought about by my hate, and it is no longer of any value to me. All ithas done was to make me all the more angry and heartless. If this is theprice of strength, I think I'd rather be weak. It is far better to besmall and have friends than to have all the strength in the universe butbe so full of anger and resentment that you can't even enjoy it.""So now that you have become a mountain of power," replied the Lion,"you no longer care to be powerful?""Exactly," sighed the Forest Monster. "If there were a way to reversetime and put things back as they should be, before I ever hurt anyone, Iwould do it. I wish I could apologize to all of the poor animals that Isapped. If their spirits are still in the vicinity, I hope they see howutterly foolish I feel for having taken such unfair advantage of them.""It is very sad that so many of our friends and families had to bedestroyed in order for you to have learned this lesson," said Elephant,thinking sadly of the loss to the forest and its denizens. "But I hopethat you will try to reverse your reputation now by putting yourstrength to good use. It is hard to forget what you did, but I thinkthat, in time, we will all be able to accept you as a neighbor. Atleast, if you act like one.""Oh, that I will do," said the spider gratefully. "I will do all that Ican to make up for my past misbehaving.""Then it seems we are no longer needed," said one of the Sniffers. "Wemet the Droffs on our way here, and they have agreed to help us plow ourfields. If our job here is done, I think we should like to go home andget started.""Me wants to plow fields," said the Droff who stood beside him."Then something positive did come of all this tragedy," said Hootsey."Not only have the Sniffers and the Stinkfoots made friends with theDroffs, but the Forest Monster has had a major-league change of heart.But can we at least find the empty shells of our families and give thema proper burial?""That would be right," agreed the Forest Monster."Wait a minute," said Ozma. "You mean to say that the bodies are stillaround? You didn't devour them entirely?""No," explained the Monster. "I only drained them of their energy. Inever actually hurt their physical bodies. Only their internal energy.""And their energies are still inside of you," observed Lisa, catching onto what Ozma was getting at. "So you never actually _killed_ them! Theirbodies are still alive, but dormant because they have no life energy.That means that, if we could reverse the process, we could put all oftheir energy back into their bodies again!""It would," agreed Ozma, "if the Forest Monster would agree to dothis." She turned to the tremendous arachnid. "It will probably meanthat you will have to allow yourself to become small again. I don't meanas small as you were when the Cowardly Lion first met you, either. Imean that you will again be reduced to the size of a regular, normalspider in order to restore all that you have wronged to their formerliveliness.""Oh, yes!" said the Forest Monster. "This I will gladly do! I am happyto go back to that small size. It allows me to maintain a lower profile,and I would like the opportunity to practice spinning my webs inprivate. I'll bet that, in time, I will be able to spin the mostgorgeous webs you can imagine! If that comes to pass, I would considerit a great honor if one of my masterpieces could be coated in silver andgold, I should like to give it to Your Majesty as a gift.""I would be delighted to receive it, I'm sure," said Ozma kindly, thoughshe was not sure what she would actually do with such a treasure. "But Ithink it is now time to restore the Lunechien beasts.""I agree," said the Cowardly Lion. "And, as everything seems to havecome out well, I think it is time I head home to the Forest where I amnow king. I've already been away too long as it is.""Of course," said Ozma, taking his paw in her hand. "Thank you for allyour help.""Think nothing of it, my Queen," he said. Then he lumbered off towardLion Country."And now," continued Ozma, "back to the job at hand." She put herfingertips to her temples and concentrated. The Forest Monster felt aslight tingling sensation in his heart, but nothing else happened."Maybe you need to use your wand," suggested Lisa. "Or say anincantation?""Or make some kind of magical motions?" put in Tweaty."No," sighed Ozma. "This operation is not as basic as all that. TheForest Monster has grown so vast that my untrained abilities are notgoing to work. It may be weeks before I will be up to this challenge.I'm afraid I'm just not used to being a fairy yet. But I think I coulddo it if I had an Anmars.""A what?" asked Elephant. "I've never heard of an Anmars before.""It's a standard magical tool that most wizards or witches would have.But I don't think there are any more witches in the area. Allidap andher evil sister were both destroyed by Dorothy, and the Witch of theDeep South got rid of most of her old implements, saying that theyreminded her of a time she'd prefer to forget.""How about Glinda?" suggested Tweaty, who was still in the form of asmall orange pachyderm. "She's a Good Witch, you know. Wouldn't she haveone of those Mars things?""An Anmars," corrected Ozma. "Yes, I'm sure she would. But the last Iheard from her, she was going to visit some place that was having adrought and try to correct it. A place called Yoraitia. I do not knowwhere it is.""Yoraitia?" echoed Tweaty. "I flew by there once! I know where it is,and it isn't very far from here. But there was a dark and shadowy placeon the way. I didn't land there, as I thought it looked scary anddangerous. But I can lead you there, if you want me to.""Then we are saved!" said Elephant with a loud trumpet blast. "Even ifthat shadowy dark place is dangerous, no one can stand up to ourformidable Forest Monster!""Er," pouted the Monster, "I'd rather not be thought of that way anymore. Like your Witch of the Deep South, there are things that remind meof a past that I'd rather forget.""Of course," said Lisa. "I'm sure Elephant didn't mean to imply that youwere mean any more.""Certainly not," replied the pachyderm. "So can we be on our way? I sowant to be reunited with Tiger and Pinky and the others.""Of course," replied the Forest Monster (and it is actually getting hardto keep referring to him by that title in light of his abrupt change ofheart. I have to wonder, was he ever really all that monstrous?). "Whydon't you ride on my back. I have very long legs, and it will make thegoing much faster."They all agreed to this plan, and were off to find Yoraitia.CHAPTER 14ME AND MY SHADOWIt has been mentioned before that, although very comprehensive mapsexist of Oz, there are areas that are totally uncharted and about whichvery little is known. One such area is the Land of Lost Shadows. In factthis may be the very first time that this mysterious land has ever beenmentioned by any living human being. That is because no one has everknown where a person's shadow goes when he dies. It has always beenassumed that when someone's physical form is no more, his shadowautomatically disappears along with it. That is quite true, of course.But does anyone ever stop to think where it disappears _to_!Now, it is very true that if you are separated from your shadow when youare alive, it can be sewn back on again. Any child who has ever read thestory of Peter Pan knows that this is so. But when a person's body dies,the shadow has no desire to be buried in the ground or to be burned up.None of these things bother the body because it is not aware ofanything. But the shadow is totally aware and is anxious to remainactive and useful. Sometimes these shadows are helpful and good. Othertimes, the opposite is true. Scholars of Oz are already well aware ofthe time when the shadow of the Wicked Witch of the East made a ploy forrevenge against the magical country. But no shadow can continue toremain alive outside of the enchanted lands. After all, it is but ashadow of its former self (if you'll pardon the pun). So it just zipsoff to Oz to reside in the Land of Lost Shadows. Now, the word 'lost' isa misnomer here. The shadow itself is anything but lost. In fact it isquite at home in its new abode. However, it is lost as far as the restof the world is concerned. Well, enough of these explanations. Let usget back to our story. No created beings other than shadows had evercrossed the borders of Shadowland (which is the name used by theinhabitants). That is, no one had until Elephant, Ozma, Tweaty, Hootsey,Lisa, Nibbles and the Forest Monster happened to stumble on it byaccident. And the way that happened was as follows: Each member of thelittle band was so preoccupied with his own thoughts--especiallyElephant. He was still thinking how close he had come to being eaten bythe Land Sharks and the miraculous change of heart on the part of theForest Monster. As for the Monster himself, he was feeling bad about allthe evil things he had done, and was contemplating what he would say inapology to all of the animals he had wronged. Since it was getting darkby this time, he failed to notice the thick, dark area looming up infront of him, when CRASH! He went straight into it. And since it wasreally dark now, the shadowy occupants were quite invisible. Hootseysuggested that there was no point in stumbling around in the dark, andthat the best thing to do would be for everyone to lie down and go tosleep.This seemed like a fine idea to Elephant, who promptly flopped down onthe grass--almost squashing Nibbles, who was already snoozing under him.The Forest Monster also took a position of repose, but far enough awayfrom his smaller charges that he knew he would not roll over and squishany of them. In the twinkling of an eye, he was fast asleep. But it washardly a restful sleep that he experienced. It was a deeply troubledsleep. In his dreams, he saw the tortured faces of the many that he hadmistreated in his angry power play. The wispy night visions experiencedby his companions were hardly any more enjoyable, except those ofPrincess Ozma, who rated enough respect from the Sleep Fays that theywould not allow any negative influences to disturb her sleep. Instead,she saw visions of the beautiful Love Fairy, and the lilting,music-like laughter of the Laughing Fay. These served to make her smileinwardly as she slept.Ozma was the first to awaken. She felt refreshed and envigorated. Thesound of birds chirping and the warm sun on her face brought her out ofher deep restful slumber.The first thing that her eyes focused upon was a two-dimensional shadowyshape moving toward her along the ground in much the same manner as theshadow of an airplane would. She instinctively looked up at the sky tosee what flying object might be casting its shadow on the ground. Butthere was nothing to account for it. Then she became apprehensive, forit occurred to her that perhaps one of the land sharks had escaped hersnailifying spell and followed them and that was what she was seeing.But no; it was definitely just a shadow, for it had stopped right infront of her. Then the shadow stood up as it became a three-dimensionalhuman being."Good morning," said the shadow, who had now taken the form of a veryordinary man. This awoke the others, who were surprised to see a man ina baseball uniform."Forgive me for startling you all," said the man. "But you see, when thesun comes up high enough in the sky, we shadows resume the forms of ourprevious selves. In fact, we are identical to our previous selves exceptthat our bodies are composed of high-frequency molecules as opposed tothe low frequency molecules of our earthly bodies." Seeing the quizzicallook on everyone's face, he quickly continued: "It's quite simple,really. We are composed of the same material you are. After all, none ofus could reside in Oz if we weren't.""It makes sense, when you think about it," said Ozma. "But I am verycurious as to why you are wearing baseball clothes. Have you just comefrom a game?""Yes, I have," answered the man. "Baseball is pretty big in Shadowland.You see, we have a large population here of old baseball players andbaseball fans. It's the biggest thing we all have in common, so we tendto congregate together. As a matter of fact, we not only have gamesbetween ourselves, but we invite teams in the United States to visitwhen the players are in restitude. We have a wonderful time together. Ofcourse, the visiting players don't usually bring back the memory of thegames when they awaken in the morning--Well, maybe some fragmenteddreams--but that doesn't detract from the game or the great fun we have.Those young whippersnappers think they'll show us old timers a thing ortwo, but boy, do they get a run for their money!""Might I inquire as to your name?" questioned Tweaty, rather timidly."Why yes," came the simple reply. "My name is Richard Marquard. Please,just call me _Rube_.""Sounds like a backwoodsy hillbilly name to me," said Elephant,intending his words to sound like friendly teasing."Ha ha!" laughed Rube, equally friendly. "My nickname being what it is,you probably automatically assume that I must have been a country boy.That's what most people figure. But it's not so. Fact is, my father wasthe Chief Engineer of the City of Cleveland, and that is where I wasborn and reared.""Okay," said Elephant. "So then, why is it that you are called _Rube_?""Well, it's a long story," answered the ball player's shadow."Then we had better not take the time to hear it all now," said Hootsey."We have a very important mission to fulfill.""Yes," agreed Lisa. "But perhaps Mr. Rube could help us. I think weshould bring him along.""A grand idea!" exclaimed Ozma. "Mr. Marquard, would you be so kind asto join us on our mission? I would like to hear your story, and thenwill be happy to tell you ours."[Illustration: "_My name is Richard Marquard. Please just call meRube."_]"If I had been asked to join an undefined questing party by any otherthan the Queen of all Oz, I might have hesitated," came the reply. "Butas it is from you, I will come along.""Splendid!" said Elephant. "Then let us be off!"Rube was lifted atop the Forest Monster, as were Elephant and theothers, and from this high podium Rube began his unique tale. "It allstarted with my father," he explained. "Like I say, he was the ChiefEngineer of the city of Cleveland. As far as he was concerned, the onlyimportant thing was for me to get a good education. But as far back as Ican remember, all I could think of, morning, noon and night, wasbaseball."'Now listen,' Dad would say. 'I want you to cut this out and payattention to your studies. I want you to go to college when you'rethrough high school, and I don't want any foolishness about it. Withoutan education, you won't be able to get a good job, and then you'll_never_ amount to anything.'"'I already have a job,' I'd say."'You've got a job? What are you talking about?'"I'm going to be a ballplayer,' I'd explain. But Dad was not veryreceptive."'A ballplayer?' he'd say, throwing his hands up in the air. 'What doyou mean? How can you make a living as a ballplayer? I don't understandwhy a grown man would wear those funny-looking suits in the firstplace.'"'Well,' I'd answer. 'You see policemen with uniforms on, and otherpeople like that. They change after they're through working. It's thesame way with ballplayers.'""That sounds reasonable to me," said Tweaty."Me, too," said Queen Ozma. "I certainly don't wear the same clothes toa meeting with a foreign dignitary as I would wear while playing marbleswith Jellia Jamb.""Certainly not!" agreed Nibbles."If only my father had thought that way," sighed Rube's shadow. "But hejust scoffed. 'Do ballplayers get paid?' he'd ask."'Yes,' I told him. 'They get paid.'"'I don't believe it!' he would rant."And 'round and 'round we would go. We'd actually have that sameargument, almost always word-for-word, at least once a week. Twice aweek in the summer. Sometimes my grandfather--my father's father--wouldget involved in it. My grandfather was a nice man who liked baseball,and he would usually take my side."'Listen,' he'd say to my father, 'when you were a youngster, I wantedyou to be something, too. I wanted you to be a stonecutter, same as Iwas when I came over from the old country.' Oh, did I mention beforethat my grandfather was a stonecutter?""No," replied Elephant. "You just said that he was a nice man who likedbaseball.""Okay," said Rube's shadow. "Well, my grandfather had been astonecutter, and had tried to persuade Dad to become one, too. 'But no!'he would say loudly into my father's ear, 'You wouldn't listen. Youwanted to be an engineer. So you _became_ an engineer. And a darned goodone, too. Had I forced you into masonry, you would never have excelledin the craft for which you had no love. And you would have been veryunhappy. Now Richard wants to be a baseball player. He's so determinedthat nothing is going to stop him. Let's give him a chance and see whathe can do. Don't force the boy to give up on his dreams.'""Your grandfather sounds like a wise man to me," said Ozma."He was," said the shadow. "But Dad would never listen. 'Ballplayers areno good,' he'd insist. 'Ballplayers are no good, and they never will beany good.' It was very frustrating. He would usually end the argument byslamming the door and going outside to sit on the porch. And he wouldstop speaking to my grandfather or me for hours at a time.""That's too bad," said Tweaty. "If you were good at baseball, you shouldhave stuck with it.""But I did stick with it," replied the shadow. "I told you, I just camefrom a game.""Oh, yeah," said Tweaty. "So you mean you brought your Dad around?""Well," the shadow said slowly. "The thing is, I was always very tallfor my age. I had three brothers and a sister, and my sister was theshortest of the five of us. She grew to be six feet two. So you see, Iwas constantly hanging around the older kids and playing ball with theminstead of hanging with kids my own age. When I was about thirteen orso, I used to carry bats for some of the Cleveland Indians, such asElmer Flick, Napoleon Lajoie and Terry Turner. Of course, they were notcalled the Cleveland Indians then. They were called the ClevelandBronchos in those days. Then the Cleveland Naps--after Napoleon Lajoie.Anyway, after the regular season was over, a lot of them would barnstormaround the Cleveland area, and sometimes I'd be their bat boy."Later on, I even pitched a few games for Bill Bradley's Boo Gang," theshadow added proudly."Boo Gang?" said Lisa with a little shudder."Boo like a Ghost?" added Hootsey."No, no," laughed Rube's image. "Bill Bradley was the third baseman forthe Cleveland Indians--and one of the greatest who ever lived--and healso barnstormed with his 'Boo Gang' after the season was over. So bythe time I was fifteen or so, I knew a lot of ballplayers. And I had myheart set on being a Big Leaguer myself."Well, one of my best friends was a catcher named Howard Wakefield. Hewas about five years older than I was. In 1906 he was playing for theWaterloo Club in the Iowa State League, and ...""1906?" echoed Lisa. "But ... But ...""What's wrong?" asked the ballplayer's shadow."You have to be mistaken," said Elephant, recognizing the reason for hisfriend's perplexity. "It isn't 1906 yet. It's only 1902!""I think he's from the future," said Lisa. "Rube Marquard is from a yearthat hasn't happened yet.""But how is that possible?" asked Hootsey."Have you ever noticed," explained the shadow, "how you can stand in themiddle of two or more different sources of light, and cast severalshadows in various directions?""Of course," said Hootsey. "And sometimes I have a long skinny shadowthat is faint and grayish, while I also have a short fat shadow rightunder me which is almost completely black. And when I'm flying, I canmake lots of different shadows that don't even touch me anywhere.""Yes," said Rube. "And these are all your shadow. If you go on a stagewith many footlights, you will cast various images of various shades ofgray. These are all your shadow. You see, your shadow can go in anydirection, backward or forward. It can reach to a distant area or staysituated close by. And it can do all at one time without ever letting goof you--even if, as you say, it isn't actually touching you. You arealways attached at some place. As the shadow of Rube Marquard, I touchhim always, even while he is far away in repose. I can be his past, hisfuture, or his mirror image. That is why I can remember experiences hehasn't even had yet. Sometimes we shadows accidentally create a feelingof deja vu in our live counterparts, which can lead to a false sense ofpsychic ability.""I don't know much about American sports figures," said Elephant. "Butit sounds like you are someone who is or will be important to Baseball.But how did you convince your dad to let you play?""Yes," agreed Hootsey. "You still haven't told us.""Of course," replied the shadow. "As I was saying, I had a friend by thename of Howard Wakefield. He was playing for the Waterloo Club in theIowa State League. That summer--when I was only sixteen--I got a letterfrom him."'_We can use a good left-handed pitcher_,' the letter said. '_And ifyou want to come to Waterloo, I'll recommend you to the manager._' Ithink Howard thought that I was at least eighteen or nineteen, as I wasso big for my age."I wrote Howard and told him that my dad did not want me to play ball,so I didn't think he'd give me the money to go. If I asked him, he'dprobably hit the ceiling and rap me over the head with something. Asidefrom that, I was ready to go.""Well," said Lisa indignantly, "a good father would have encouraged youto go. He should have been able to see that you were good at what youdid, and that you deserved this chance to make good.""Absolutely," agreed Hootsey. "But I don't expect that your father gaveyou the money. Did you ever get to Waterloo?""Well," answered the shadow, "pretty soon I got a telegram from theWaterloo manager. He said that I had been recommended very highly byHoward Wakefield, and asked if I would like to come and try out for theteam. The Waterloo manager offered to reimburse the cost oftransportation if I was given a contract.""But you still couldn't get the money from your father," said Ozma."No," sighed the ballplayer. "It was hardly an improvement over Howard'sletter. So I just went upstairs to my room and closed the door. Then Iwrote back a long letter to the Waterloo manager, explaining that Ididn't have any money for transportation. But I told him that, if hesent me an advance right now for transportation, I'd be on the very nexttrain to Waterloo and he could take it out of my salary later on.""That's assuming you were hired, of course," said Lisa."Yes," agreed Rube. "But I didn't have the slightest doubt that I wouldmake good. And, of course, I didn't mention that I was only sixteenyears old. I thought it best to leave that out."I mailed the letter to Iowa, and then I waited on pins and needles foran answer. Every day I had to be the first one to get at the mail,because if anyone else saw a letter to me from the Waterloo BallClub--well, that would have been enough to alert Dad to what was goingon and I'd have been sunk. So every day I waited for the first sign ofthe mailman and tried to get to him before he reached the house. As itturned out, I could have saved myself a lot of worrying.""No letter ever came?" guessed Lisa."Nope. Three weeks passed and still no answer." The shadow sighed again."I couldn't understand what had gone wrong. Maybe it was against therules to send transportation money to somebody not yet under contract?Maybe they didn't know how good I really was? Maybe this and maybe that.It was another frustrating period of my life. Finally, I just couldn'tstand it any longer. I gave my folks a story about camping with the BoyScouts and hitch-hiked to Waterloo.""You lied to your parents?" said Ozma, startled by the very idea."Yes, I did. It was a hard thing for me to do, going against Dad likethat. But I was well punished for the deed. Believe me! Have you everhad to hitch-hike, sleep in open fields, or hop a freight train? It tookme five days and five nights. The longest five days of my life, and Iwas only sixteen at the time. But I did get there. Tired, anxious andhalf-starved, I blew into the Illinois Central Station at Waterloo, Iowaon a freight train early in the evening. Just before it stopped, Ijumped off and went head over heels right in front of the passengerhouse. I hardly had time to pick myself up off the ground before thestationmaster grabbed me and shouted, 'What do you think you're doing?Come on, get out of here before I run you in!'"'No,' I said. 'I'm reporting to the Waterloo Ball Club.'"'You're what?' he says. 'My God! Did you ever wash your face?'"'Yes I did,' I said. 'But I've been travelling for five days and fivenights, and I am anxious to get to the Ball Park. Where do theballplayers hang around?'"'At the Smoke Shop,' he says. 'Down the street about a half of a mile.If you walk down there, probably whoever you're looking for will bethere.'"So I thanked him and said I'd see to it that he got a free pass to theball game as soon as I got settled, and started off for the Smoke Shop.It turned out that two brothers owned the Smoke Shop, and they alsoowned the Ball Club. One of them was behind the counter when I walkedinto the place. He took one look at me and let out a roar like a lion's."'What are you doing in here?' he yelled. This is a respectable place!Get out of here!'"'Wait a minute,' I says. 'I've got a telegram from the manager of theBall Club to report here, and if I make good I'll get a contract.'"'Are you kidding?' he says. 'Who in the world ever recommended you?'"'Howard Wakefield did,' I said."'Well,' says the guy behind the counter, 'Wakefield is in back shootingbilliards. We'll soon settle this!'"I'd like to go back and see him,' I said."'Don't you go back there,' he shouted. 'Don't even think about goingback there! You'll drive everybody out. Did you ever take a bath?'"'Of course I did,' says I. 'But I've bummed my way here and I haven'thad a chance to clean up yet.'"So he goes into the back and in a minute Howard comes out 'Cripes!' hesays. 'What happened to you?'"I was explaining it to him when in came Mr. Frisbee, the manager, and Iwas introduced to him. 'I received your telegram,' I said. 'I didn'thave enough money to come first class or anything like that, but here Iam.'"'Keokuk is here tomorrow,' says the manager, 'and we'll pitch you.'""'We'll pitch you?'" echoed Hootsey. "What a mean thing for him to say!Imagine, just pitching you out after all your effort to get there!""No, no," explained the shadow. "He meant that he wanted me to pitch thenext day. But I was all tuckered out and hardly ready to do that. Ireally wanted to have a bath and get some sleep."'Tomorrow or never, Young Fellow,' he says to me. Tomorrow or not atall.'"'All right,' I said. 'But could I have five dollars in advance so I canget a clean shirt or something?'"'After the game tomorrow,' he said. Then he just walked away from melike I was nothing.""How rude," said Elephant."The least he could have done would have been to let you take a showerin the locker-room," said Lisa."Well, I got to clean up," admitted Rube. "Howard took me to his roominghouse and gave me something to eat. They let me sleep on an extra cotthey had. And the next day we went to the Ball Park and I was introducedto the players and given a uniform that was too small for me. The Keokukteam was shagging balls while I warmed up, and they kept making commentsabout green rookies and bushers and nitchies and such; and how they'dknock me out of the box in the first inning; and how I should havestayed home with my Mommy. Ooh, I felt terrible. I had an awful headacheand I was exhausted! Still, I was determined to show them that I couldmake good, and I went out there and won that game six against one!"With that," continued the shadow, "I felt sure I'd be offered acontract. So after the game, I went to Mr. Frisbee and said, 'Welp, Ishowed you I could deliver the goods. Can we talk about a contractnow?'"'Oh,' he says to me. 'Keokuk is in last place. Wait until Oskaloosacomes in this weekend. They are in second place. They are a rough team,and if you can beat them, then we'll talk.'"'Can't I get any money--any advance money--on my contract?' I askedhim."'You haven't got a contract,' he said."'All right,' says I, and I didn't say another word. I knew that he wasright. I'd have to prove myself before I could expect any handouts fromthis man. So I stayed quiet. I didn't say anything to anybody thatevening. But when it got dark, I went down to the railway station, andthe same stationmaster was there. He remembered me."'Hey!' he says. 'You pitched a fine game today! I was there, and youdid a great job! What are you doing back here? Did you come to give methat free ticket you promised me?'"'No,' I said to him sadly. I'm sorry. I'm going back home to Cleveland,and I want to know what time a freight comes by.' Then I explained tohim about everything that had happened. Oh, he was very nice to me. Hecompletely understood where I was coming from. After we had talked forawhile, he said, 'Look, the train comes in at one o'clock in the morningand the engine unhooks and goes down to the water tower. When it does,you sneak into the baggage compartment. Meanwhile, I'll talk to thebaggage man before the engine gets hooked up again. So when the trainpulls out and is about five miles out of town, he'll open the baggagedoor and let you out.'"And that is pretty much what happened," continued Rube. "When we werefive miles out of town, the door opened and the baggage man appeared. Italked with him all the way to Chicago, and as we got close to the yardshe says to me, 'Okay, you'd better get ready to jump now. There are alot of detectives around here and if you're not careful, they'll jumpon you and throw you in jail. So once you get to the ground, do nothesitate! Beat it away from here as fast as you can!'"The baggage man must have told the engineer about me, as we slowed downto a crawl just before we approached the Chicago yards, and off Ijumped. I got out of there quick and took off down the street. I don'tknow what street it was, and I'm not sure where I was headed, but I doremember that I was awfully tired. It was the middle of the morning andI had hardly slept a wink the night before. I had staggered about threeor four blocks when I passed by a fire engine house. Evidently all ofthe firemen were out at a fire, because the place was deserted. I wastired, very tired, so I went in and sat down. Well, they had a bigbellied iron stove in there, and it was warm. I guess I must have fallenasleep, as the next thing I knew, a couple of firemen were shaking meand doing everything they could do to wake me up. They called me a bumand a lot of other bad names, and told me to get out of there or they'dhave me thrown in jail."'I'm no bum,' I said. 'I'm a ballplayer.'"'What?' the firemen laughed. 'You, a ballplayer? Where did you everplay?'"'In Cleveland, around the sandlots,' I told them proudly. 'And inWaterloo, Iowa, too! I beat the Keokuk team six to one!'"'Yeah?' said one of the firemen. 'And last week I had dinner with SantaClaus and the Pope. So I suppose you're going to tell me that you areclose buddies with Three-Fingered Brown, Chance, Tinker and Evans--Imean, Evers--and all of those fellows?'"'No,' I said. 'I don't know them. But some day I'll be playing withthem, or against them, because I'm going to get in the Big Leagues.'"'Where are you going now?' asked the firemen."'Back home to Cleveland,' I told them."'Have you got any money?' they asked me."'No,' I answered. I had to be honest, after all."So they got up a little pool of about five dollars and said, 'Well, onyour way. And use this to get something to eat.'"I thanked them, and as I left I told them that some day I would be backagain. 'When I get to the Big Leagues,' I said, I'm coming out to visityou when we get to Chicago.'"And home I went. I played around home all the rest of the summer, andthen the next summer--that would have been 1907, if I recall correctly,even though I'm remembering things that have yet to happen and I'mremembering them backwards--I took a job with an ice cream company inCleveland. I made twenty-five dollars a week: Fifteen for checking thecans on the truck that would take the ice cream away, and ten dollars aSunday, when I pitched for the company team. It was a good team. Weplayed the best semipro clubs in the Cleveland area, and I beat themall. I was only seventeen, but I hardly lost a game."Then one day I got a postal card from the Cleveland Ball Club, askingme to come in and talk to them. Mr. Kilfoyl and Mr. Somers, the ownersof the club, wanted to see me.""Hurray!" said Hootsey. "So then, your father must have come around bythen?""Hardly!" said the shadow. "My Dad saw the postal card and became veryupset. 'So,' he said to me. 'I see that you still want to be aballplayer.'"'Yes,' I admitted. 'I do. And I'm going to be a great one, too! Justyou wait and see! Some day you're going to be proud of me!'"'Yeah,' he shrugged. 'Proud of nothing.'"But I went to the Cleveland club's office all the same, and Mr. Kilfoyland Mr. Somers were both there. I told them that I had received theircard. 'You know,' I added, 'You got me into a little jam. My dad doesn'twant me to be a ballplayer.'"'Don't you worry,' said Mr. Kilfoyl 'After you sign with us and getinto the Big Leagues, he'll think differently about it.'"'Well,' I said, 'I'm not signing with you or anybody else until I hearwhat you're offering. I've been taken advantage of before, and it's notgoing to happen again. I know a lot of ballplayers and they always tellme not to sign with anybody unless I get a good salary. They all tell meyou better get it when you're young, 'cause you sure won't get it whenyou're old.'"'That's a lot of nonsense,' Mr. Kilfoyl said. 'Don't you worry. We'lltreat you right. We'll give you a hundred dollars a month. That's awonderful offer.'"'I think he'll be overpaid,' Mr. Somers says."'I don't think that is so wonderful,' I said. 'And as for beingoverpaid, I get that much right now from the ice cream company, and inaddition I get to eat all the ice cream I want.'""So it really wasn't an honorable offer," tsked Ozma. "Did they raisetheir offer?""No," replied the shadow with a sad expression. "They wouldn't increasetheir price. And I wouldn't reduce mine. So I left and went home. On myway home, though, I stopped in this sporting-goods store at 724 ProspectAvenue. It was owned by Bill Bradley and Ryan ... Phylli ... --I mean,Charlie Carr. Charlie managed and played first base for Indianapolis inthe American Association. Bill, as I think I may have mentioned before,played third base for Cleveland."Anyway, when I walked in the door, Bill Bradley said, 'Hello, BigLeaguer. I understand that the boss wants to sign you up.'"'Not me,' I said. 'He wouldn't pay me as much as I already make withthe ice cream company.'"'You know,' said Charlie Carr, 'I manage the Indianapolis Club.'"'I know that,' I said. After all, everybody knew that!"'How would you like to sign with me?' Charlie said with a smile."'You're in the minor leagues,' I replied. 'If a major league club won'tpay me what I want, how could you do it?'"'How much do you want?' he wanted to know."I took a deep breath and then answered, 'Two hundred a month.'"'Wow!' he said. 'You want all the money, don't you?'"'No,' I told him. 'But you want a good pitcher, don't you?'"'Yes,' he answered simply."'Well, I said, I'm one.'"The five Ozites laughed at this, and the shadow smiled. He was actuallybeginning to fear that he was giving them too many details and that hisstory may be becoming long-winded and dull. But seeing that he was notboring his listeners, he continued:"He agreed to my terms, of course. So right then I signed my firstprofessional contract, with Indianapolis of the American Association."When I got home that night I had to tell my dad about it, because I wasto leave for Indianapolis the very next day. Oh, that was a terriblenight! Finally, Dad said, 'Now listen, I've told you time and time againthat I don't want you to be a professional ballplayer. But you've gotyour mind made up. Now I'm going to tell you something: when you crossthat threshold, don't come back. I don't ever want to see you again.'""No!" said Ozma with a start. "No way! No father would say such a thingto his own son!""That was just what my father said to me," said Rube sadly. "He didn'twant me to come home again. I was excommunicated from the family.""That's awful!" said Lisa. "Parents do have a certain responsibilitytoward any children that they brought into the world! He was a skinflintand a creep!""Yes," agreed Rube. "His actions that day were like those of a regularskunk!""I've known some very nice skunks in my day," said Hootsey."In any case," said the shadow, not wanting to get into a debate abouthis use of the word _skunk_, "I was as shocked as you all seem to be."'You don't mean that, Dad!" I said."'Yes, I do.'"'Well,' I replied. 'I'm going. And some day you'll be proud of me.'"'Proud!' he said. 'You're breaking my heart, and I don't ever want tosee you again.'"'I will not break your heart,' I said. 'I'll add more years to yourlife. You wait and see.'"And so it was that I went to Indianapolis. They optioned me out toCanton in the Central League for the rest of the 1907 season, and I wontwenty-three games with them, which was one-third of all the games theCanton Club won that year.""Good for you, Rube!" said Elephant, genuinely proud of his new friend."The next year--that would have been 1908--I went to Spring Trainingwith the Indianapolis Club. We went to French Lick Springs, Indiana.After three weeks there we went back to Indianapolis and played a fewexhibition games before the season opened. Well, believe it or not, thefirst club to come in for an exhibition game was the Cleveland team:Napoleon Lajoie, Terry Turner, Elmer Flick, George Stovall and the wholebunch that I used to carry bats for. When they came on the field I wasalready warming up."'Hey!' a couple of them yelled at me. 'What are you doing here? Are youthe bat boy here?'"'No,' I smugly replied. 'I am the pitcher.'"'You, a pitcher?' they jeered. 'Who do you think you're kidding?'"'Just ask Bill Bradley,' I told them. 'He was there when I signed myfirst contract. You'll see. I'm going to pitch against you guys today,and I'm going to beat you, too.'"'Beat us? Busher, you couldn't beat a drum!'"So then Bill Bradley came over and said hello. As he was leaving hesaid, 'Richard, you're a nice boy, so I want to give you some advicebefore today's game. Be careful of the Frenchman.' He meant NapoleonLajoie. He said, The Frenchman is very sharp and he's been hittingterrific line drives this past week. He's almost killed three of our ownpitchers in practice, so there's no telling what he'll do in a realgame, even if it is just an exhibition game.'"I thanked him, of course, and went back to warming up. Well, I pitchedthe whole nine innings and beat them, two to zero. Lajoie got two hitsoff me, and I think George Stovall got a couple, but I shut themout--and I wasn't killed, either."That night Charlie Carr called me over. 'You know,' he said, 'a funnything just happened. Mr. Somers, the owner of the Cleveland club, justcame over to my hotel room and wanted to buy you. He offered me threethousand five hundred dollars for your contract with the understandingthat you'd stay here all season, to get more experience, and then youwould join the Cleveland club next year.'"'Charlie,' I said, 'if you sell me to Somers, I'm going right back tothe ice cream company. He had first chance to get me, and he wouldn'tgive me what I deserved. So long as Somers is involved, I won't play forCleveland, no matter what.'"'Okay,' he said. 'Don't worry. I won't sell you. Later on I'll be ableto sell you for a lot more, anyway.'"On opening day, Kansas City was at Indianapolis, and I pitched theopening game. I won two to one, and that evening the story in theIndianapolis _Star_ read like this: 'The American Association seasonopened up today, and it was a beautiful game between two fine teams.Each had great pitching, with an eighteen year old right-handerpitching for Kansas City and an eighteen year old left-hander for thehome team. The right-hander with Kansas City looks like he's going todevelop into a great pitcher. They call him Smoky Joe Wood. But we havea left-hander with Indianapolis who is going places, too. He resemblesone of the great left-handed pitchers of all time: Rube Waddell.'"And from that day on, they nicknamed me 'Rube.'"I had a wonderful season that year with Indianapolis. I pitchedforty-seven complete games, won twenty-eight of them, led the league inmost strikeouts, least hits, most innings pitched, and everything.Occasionally what I'd do would be reported in the Cleveland papers, andfriends of mine would tell me that they'd pass by the house and see Dadsitting on the porch."'Well, Fred,' they'd say--that was Dad's name, by the way, Fred--'Didyou see what your son Rube did yesterday?'"'Who are you talking about?' he'd say. 'Rube who?'"'Your son--Richard,' they would answer."'I told him that baseball was no good,' my dad would reply. 'Nowthey've even gone and changed his name!'"Anyway, I had a terrific year with Indianapolis, like I said. Late inthe season we went into Columbus, Ohio, and Charlie Carr came up to mebefore the game."'Rube,' he said, 'there are going to be an awful lot of celebritieshere at the game today. The American and National Leagues both have anoff-day, and they're all coming to see you pitch. If you pitch a goodgame I may be able to sell you before the night is out.'"'For how much?' I wanted to know."'I don't know,' he said. 'But a lot. It depends on what kind of gameyou pitch.'"'Will you cut me in?' I asked."'No, I won't,' he said with certainty. 'You're getting a good salaryand you know it.'"'Okay,' I said. I was only kidding anyway."'I don't want you to get nervous today,' he said."'Nervous?' I repeated. 'Have I ever been nervous all season?'"'No,' he admitted, 'I've been in baseball a long time and I never sawanything like it. I never saw a kid like you, who can beat anybody andis so successful.'"'Well,' I said, 'the reason I'm so successful is because I can beatanybody.'""Now aren't you getting a little carried away with your bragging?" askedNibbles. "I mean, I'm very much enjoying your story, even though I knowlittle about baseball except that you play it on a bass drum. Butreally, I think you're carrying your pride a little too far into thenegative.""Yeah," admitted Rube, "I am sorry about that. Sometimes that happens tome when I get too worked up. Anyway, I went out there that day and Ipitched one of those unusual games: no hits, no runs, no errors.Twenty-seven men faced me and not one of them got to first base. Andthat evening in Columbus they put me up for sale, with all the BigLeague clubs bidding on me, like a horse being auctioned off. TheCleveland club went as high as ten thousand five hundred dollars for mycontract, but the Giants went to eleven grand, and I was sold to them.At that time, that was the highest price ever paid for a baseballplayer."I reported to the New York Giants in September of 1908, as soon as theAmerican Association season was over. I was eigh ...""It still feels a little odd to have you 'remembering' things from yearsthat have not yet been," interrupted Hootsey."Let him finish the story," admonished Elephant."I am sorry," said Rube. "But it is a memory to me, and a prediction toyou. I will try to be more careful about naming years if I can rememberto be. But in any event, I was eighteen years old at the time, andalready the most valuable player in the Big Leagues! Excuse me if Iseem to boast, but I feel that I am justified this time. I was the heroof the hour."Still, I came up too late in the season to make a trip to Chicago withthe Giants that year, but the next season we made our first trip toChicago the second week in June. And the first thing I did, as soon as Igot there, was to make a beeline for that firehouse."The only one there when I first got there was the Lieutenant. I walkedup to him and said, 'Lieutenant, do you remember me?'"'Never saw you before in my life,' he said."'Well, remember about three years ago you caught me sleeping back ofthat stove there?'"'Oh, are you that kid from Cleveland that said he's a ballplayer?'"'Yes!' I told him. 'Remember me? My name is Marquard. RichardMarquard.'"'Of course,' he said, not really interested. 'What are you doing here?'"'I am in the Big Leagues,' I explained. 'I told you when I got to theBig Leagues I was coming out to visit you.'"'Well I'll be ...' he began, then, 'Who are you with?'"'Why, I'm with the New York Giants,' I said with pride."And boy, for years after that, whenever the Giants would come toChicago, I'd go out to that firehouse. I'd sit out front and talk forhours. The firemen would have all the kids in the neighborhood there ...and all the families that lived around would stop by ... and it wasreally wonderful. Everybody was so nice and friendly. Gee, I used toenjoy that. It was a great thrill for me."Actually, every single day of all the years I spent in the Big Leagueswas a thrill for me. It was like a dream come true. I was in the BigLeagues for eighteen years, you know, from 1908 through 192 ... Oh,yeah. Sorry about that. I was with the Giants for seven glorious years,with the Dodgers for five years after that, with Cincinnati for oneyear, and then with the Boston Braves for four. And I loved every singleminute of it!"The best years of all were those with the Giants. I don't mean becausethose were my best pitching years, although they were. In 1911 I wontwenty-four games and lost only seven. And in 1912 I won twenty-six.That's the year I won nineteen straight! I didn't lose a single game in1912 until July eighth!"Actually, at the risk of sounding boastful again, I won twentystraight, not nineteen. But because of the way they scored then, Ididn't get credit for one of them. I relieved Jeff Tesreau in the eighthinning of a game one day, with the Giants behind, three to two. In theninth inning, Heinie Groh singled and Art Wilson homered, and we won,four to three. But they gave Tesreau credit for the victory instead ofme. Except for that it would have been twenty straight wins, notnineteen.""It's still a pretty magnificent record," harumphed Elephant "I don'tsee any reason for all the sour grapes.""Oh, no," said Rube's shadow. "No sour grapes. It was the grandest yearof my life. Of course, I had other great years with the Giants, too. In1914--er, sorry. I've just told this story this way for so long, it ishard to change it now--I beat Babe Adams and the Pirates in atwenty-one inning game, three to one. Both of us went the entiredistance that day, all twenty-one innings. And the following year, Ipitched a no-hitter against Brooklyn and beat Nap Rucker, two tonothing.""No wonder you remember your years with the Giants best," said Hootseyunderstandingly."Oh, no," said Rube. "But that's not the reason. The real reason is ...Well, maybe it's because that was my first club. I don't know. Whateverthe reason, though, it was wonderful to be a Giant back then."Take Mr. McGraw, for example. What a great man he was! The finest andgrandest man I ever met! He loved his players and his players loved him.Of course, he wouldn't stand for any nonsense. You had to live up to therules and regulations of the New York Giants, and when he laid down thelaw you'd better abide by it!"I'll never forget one day we were playing Pittsburgh, and it was RedMurray's turn to bat, with the score tied in the ninth inning. There wasa man on second with none out. Murray came over to McGraw--I was sittingnext to McGraw on the bench--and he said, 'What do you want me to do,Mac?'"'What do I want you to do?' McGraw said. 'What are you doing in theNational League? There's the winning run on second base and no one out.What would you do if you were the manager?'"'I'd sacrifice the man to third,' Murray said."'Well,' McGraw said, 'that's exactly what I want you to do.'"So Murray went up to the plate to bunt. After he got to the batter'sbox, though, he backed out and looked over at McGraw again."McGraw poked his elbow in my ribs. 'Look at that so-and-so,' he said.'He told me what he should do, and I told him what he should do, and nowhe's undecided. I'll bet he forgot from the bench to the plate.'"Now, in those days--and I guess it's the same now--when a man was upthere to bunt, the pitcher would try to keep the ball high and tight.Well, it so happened that Red was a high-ball hitter. Howie Camnitz waspitching for Pittsburgh. He wound up and in came the ball, shoulderhigh. Murray took a terrific cut at it and the ball went over theleft-field fence. It was a home run and the game was over."Back in the clubhouse, Murray was as happy as a lark. He was first intothe showers, and out boomed his wonderful Irish tenor, singing _My WildIrish Rose_. When he came out of the shower, still singing, McGrawwalked over and tapped him on the shoulder. All of us were watching outof the corner of our eyes, because we knew The Little Round Man--that'swhat we used to call McGraw--wouldn't let this one go by without saying_something_."'Murray,' McGraw said. 'What did I tell you to do?'"'You told me to bunt,' Murray said, not looking quite so happy anymore.'But you know what happened, Mac. Camnitz put one right in my gut, so Icow-tailed it.'"'Where did you say he put it?' asked McGraw."'Right in my gut,' Murray says again."'Well,' said McGraw, I'm fining you a hundred dollars, and you can tryputting that right in your gut, too!' And off he went."Oh, God! I never laughed so much in my life! Murray never did live thatdown. Years later something would happen and we'd yell to Murray, 'HeyRed, is that right in your gut?'"There were a lot of grand guys on that club: Christy Mathewson andChief Meyers, Larry Doyle and Fred Snodgrass, Al Bridwell and BugsRaymond. Bugs Raymond! Ah, yes! What a terrific spitball pitcher he was.Bugs drank a lot, you know, and sometimes it seemed like the more hedrank the better he pitched. They used to say that he didn't spit on theball: he blew his breath on it, and the ball would come up drunk."Actually, there was very little drinking in baseball in those days.It's a shame that drinking will become more and more commonplace inAmerican sports with the passage of time. I have seen it, and it is sad.Myself, I've never smoked or took a drink in my life. I always said youcan't burn the candle at both ends. You want to be a ballplayer, be aballplayer. If you want to go out and carouse and chase around, do that.But you can't do them both at once."Of course," continued Rube Marquard's shadow, 'when we were on theroad, we had a nightly eleven o'clock bed check. At eleven o'clock weall had to be in our rooms and the trainer would come around and checkus off. We'd usually have a whole floor in a hotel and we'd be two to aroom. I always roomed with Matty all the while I was on the Giants. Whata grand guy he was! The door would be wide open at eleven o'clock andthe trainer would come by with a board with all the names on it. He'dpoke his head in: Mathewson, Marquard, check. And lock the door. Nextroom, check, lock the door."As far as I was concerned, I never drank a drop even when I was in showbusiness. In 1912 I made a movie with Alice Joyce and Maurice Costello,and then I was in vaudeville for three years, Blossom Seeley and I.That's when she was my wife. It didn't work out, though. I asked her toquit the stage. I told her I could give her everything she wanted."'No,' she told me. 'Show business is show business.'"'Well,' I said, 'baseball is mine.' So we parted.""You mentioned that you were with the Giants for seven years, and thenthe Dodgers for five, did you not? How did it feel when you were tradedfrom the Giants to the Dodgers?" asked Elephant."Well," said the shadow, "not too bad. See, I traded myself. I didn'tseem to be able to get going in 1915 after I pitched that no-hitterearly in April, and late in the season McGraw started riding me. Thatwas a very bad year for the Giants, you know. We were favored to win thepennant, and instead we wound up last. So McGraw wasn't very happy.After I had taken about as much riding as I could stand, I asked him totrade me if he thought I was so bad."'Who would take you?' he said to me."'What do you mean?' I asked. 'I can still lick any club in the league.'And I could, too! Heck, I wasn't even twenty-six years old then."'Lick any club in the league?' scoffed McGraw. 'You couldn't lick apostage stamp!'"'Give me a chance to trade myself, then,' I suggested. 'What would yousell me for?'"'Seven thousand five hundred bills,' he answered."'Okay,' I said. 'Can I use your phone?'"'Sure,' he said."We were both pretty mad at that point, so I got 'hold of the operatorand asked her to get me Wilbert Robinson, manager of the Brooklyn club.You see, Robbie--that's what we called him--had been a coach with us foryears before he became the Dodger manager in 1914. After a while, shegot Robbie on the phone."'Hello?' he says."'How are you, Robbie?' I asked."Fine,' he said. 'Who is this?'"Now, I had to handle this conversation very carefully. My whole worlddepended on it. 'How would you like to have a good left-handed pitcher?'I said in a jovial tone."I'd love it,' he said. 'Who is this? Who's the man? Who are you goingto recommend?'"I then dropped the clincher. 'I'm going to recommend myself,' I toldhim."'Who are you?' he repeated."'Rube Marquard,' I said, trying to sound impressive."'Oh,' Robbie said. 'What are you kidding around for, Rube? I have to goout on the field and I don't have time to fool around.'"'No,' I told him, 'I'm serious! McGraw is right here and he says he'llsell me for seven thousand five hundred buckaroos! Do you want to talkto him?'"'Of course I do,' Robbie said. And right then and there I was tradedfrom the Giants to the Dodgers."And, of course, we--the Dodgers, that is--won the pennant the nextyear, and I had one of the best years I ever had. I think I had anearned run average of about one and a half in 1916. And then we won thepennant again in 1920. So everything worked out pretty well."One day when I was pitching for Brooklyn, I pitched the first game of adouble-header against Boston and beat them, one to zip! I was in theclubhouse during the second game, taking off my uniform, when theclubhouse boy came in. 'Rube,' he said to me, 'there's an elderlygentleman outside who wants to see you. He says he's your father fromCleveland."'He is not my father,' I said. 'My father wouldn't go across the streetto see me. But you go out and get his autograph book and bring it in,and I'll autograph it for him.'"But instead of bringing in the book, he brought in my Dad. And we wereboth delighted to see one another."'Boy,' said my father to me, 'you sure are a hardhead. You know Ididn't mean what I said ten years ago.'"'What about you, Dad?' I said. 'You're as stubborn as I am. I thoughtyou never wanted to see me again. I thought you meant it.'"'Of course I didn't,' he said."After we talked a while, I said, 'Did you see the game today?'"'Yes,' he said, 'I did.'"'Where were you sitting?' I asked him."'Well, you know the man who wears that funny thing on his face?'"'You mean the mask? The catcher?' I said."'I guess so,' my father said with a smile. 'Well, anyway, I was halfwaybetween him and the number one--you know, where they run right afterthey hit the ball?'"'You mean first base?' I asked."'I don't know,' he said. 'I don't know what they call it. I was sittingin the middle there.'"'How many ball games have you seen since I became a ballplayer, Dad?' Iwanted to know."'This is the first one,' he said."Well, he stayed in New York with me for a few weeks, and we had agreat time. Finally, he had to go back to Cleveland. After he'd left,the newspapers heard about my Dad and they wanted to know his addressback home. So I gave it to them, and doggone if they didn't sendreporters and photographers to Cleveland to interview him."They took his picture and asked him a lot of questions. One of thethings they asked him was whether he had ever played very much baseballhimself."'Oh,' he told them, 'of course I did, when I was younger. I used tolove to play baseball. I used to be a pitcher, just like my sonRichard--I mean, like my son Rube.'"'Are you proud of your son?' they asked him."'I certainly am,' Dad said. 'Why shouldn't I be? He's a great baseballplayer, isn't he?'"The group of Ozites was silent for a few moments as the Forest Monstercarried them along toward Yoraitia. The large pachyderm could feel atear welling up in his left eye, and he brushed it away with his trunk.CHAPTER 15THE RESTORATION OF THE LUNECHIEN FOREST OF OZThe little party arrived in Yoraitia in a short time. When they gotthere, it looked like as happy a township as any other in the MarvelousLand of Oz."I knew there could not be any really serious drought in our fairyland,"said Elephant happily. "After all, Oz is always pleasant and lovely.Lurline's enchantment has always seen to that.""I thought that Lurline was only a character from an ancient legend,"scowled the Forest Monster. "In any event, I was not created by anyFairy enchantment. I know, for I was created by two prominent WickedWitches.""And I was hatched out of an egg just like any other hoot-owl," repliedLisa. "But that doesn't prove anything. In any event, Glinda the Goodsaid there was a drought happening here. But clearly she was mistaken. Idon't think droughts are natural in any part of Oz, anyway.""They aren't," agreed Ozma. "But Glinda would not have told me a lie.She must have believed there was one here.""I think maybe she was right," said Tweaty. "Look here. I see that thistree was only watered recently. See? It looks like it has been leaningover since ... well, since at least last Tuesday at around threeo'clock. Before that, I fear it was left dry for several weeks.""Tweaty's right," agreed Nibbles. "I can see it starting to straightenup even as I look at it!""Then how," began Elephant, "did it ... Oh, I think I know.""Of course!" added Lisa. "Glinda has already been here. She has alreadydetermined the source of the problem and fixed it!"As she spoke, she noticed out of the corner of her left eye that anotherpersonage had joined the group."Glinda!" said Ozma, instantly recognizing the newcomer."Your Majesty," replied Glinda with a loving smile. "I see that you havecome to see that the Yoraitians have been provided for. It was reallyvery simple. You see, a tribe of giant polka-dot beavers had justclaimed a territory a few miles up the river. It is natural forpolka-dot beavers to build dams, and they had no awareness that theirswas blocking off the water supply of any inhabited towns. Once theyfound out, they were happy to remedy the situation. Now they are happilyhelping Yoraitia to better utilize its water supply. They are reallyvery intelligent animals, and they have acknowledged you as their Queen,too.""I am very pleased," said the youthful ruler."But that is not why we are here," put in Lisa quickly. "The Queen needsher Anmars. It is the only way that she can save the residents of theLunechien Forest.""The Lunechien Forest?" echoed the Good Witch. "Why, my goodness! Whatis wrong with the Lunechien Forest? The last I read of it in my GreatBook of Records, it was a very happy land of elephants and unicorns andother carefree creatures.""Indeed it was," said the Forest Monster gravely. "But I'm afraid itshardships are all my fault. In my thirst for power, I drained many ofthe small, unfortunate beasts of all their strengths and abilities. Ihave since seen the error of my ways, and I repent of my unOzlikeactions. I had been so blinded by my resentment toward the Cowardly Lionthat I was not even thinking about how much wickedness I was doing. Thelittle Princess-Queen of Oz has forgiven me already. I am willing to dowhatever I can to make restitution for my acts. I know that you are alsoa Queen and that you are one of Ozma's closest advisors. If you wish mebanished from all Oz once you have restored all of my poor victims, Iwill accept the punishment without a murmur."The shadow of Rube Marquard stood still and listened with a puzzledexpression on his face.Ozma looked at Glinda. "The Forest Monster really has repented," shesaid. "I saw the change with my own two eyes. He is willing to berestored to the size of a natural spider so that all the others can havewhat he took from them.""Then it shall be done," agreed Glinda, handing Ozma the magical tool.The Forest Monster carried the entire group--including Glinda--to thefamous Ozian forest. Instantly, he and Ozma gathered up the comatoseLunechien animals and prepared to restore them to rights.Glinda also lent a hand in the restoration process. It was not an easytask, but in only a little more than fourteen hours the lush LunechienForest was once again alive with the sounds of joyful birds and animalsmilling about among the trees and bushes.At the end of it all, the Forest Monster was as small as a typicalarachnid. Still, his tiny face was all smiles. Indeed, he was as happyas a lark that the poor animals he had wronged could be righted again.And, in fact, it has been recorded in Glinda's Great Book of Recordsthat not a single animal was overlooked during the restoration process.All were brought back to their former care-free selves withoutexception. Well, maybe one exception. Somehow, in all of the hubbub,Tweaty was overlooked. He did not consider it politic to interrupt theproceedings. After all, his fellow beasts had had a far worseenchantment than he had. Of course it was uncomfortable to be a tinyorange elephant. But how much worse to be completely without oneself. Hedecided to wait until another time to ask to be restored. He felt thatit would be too much of a selfish act to ask Ozma or Glinda to take timeaway from those who truly needed their help when he knew that he couldstand to be a small orange elephant for a little while longer.The reunion of the Lunechien friends and families was a cause forcelebration throughout the Forest. A grand party was enjoyed by all, andeven the Cowardly Lion made another trip away from home to pay hisrespects upon his fellow Foresters. The celebration went on 'til the weehours of the morning, when Ozma and Glinda had to get back to theirregular duties.As for the residents of the Lunechien Forest, I am told that they are ashappy today as ever they were.The former Forest Monster, now content to stay small and keep a lowprofile, continues to this day to spin the most delicate and beautifulwebs you can imagine. And, indeed, he did have one of his creationscovered in gold, and gave it to Ozma as a sign of his submission to herrule. She keeps it hanging over her bed in such a way that it is thelast thing she looks upon at night. The spider-creature has told me thatit functions as a dreamcatcher, preventing any unhappy dreams from everreaching her as she slumbers. The Sleep Fays, who once kept out thesebad dreams, have voiced their gratitude to the former Forest Monster forthis fine gift.And now, it is time to say goodbye for a time to our happy friends inOz. But do not fret. Queen Ozma is always sending us new messages fromher glorious domain. I can assure you that it will not be so very longat all before we will all be getting together again over another Ozbook. Until then, both of your grateful historians wish you as muchhappiness as is again known in the Lunechien Forest of Oz.THE ENDA hard copy of this book is available at:http://members.aol.com/LionCoward/home.html Also available is thesequel: "The Magic Topaz of Oz"***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FOREST MONSTER OF OZ********** This file should be named 10419.txt or 10419.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/4/1/10419Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.

Warton, in a note in vol. xvii. of the _Variorum_ Shakespeare, says,"_Samingo_, that is _San Domingo_, as some of the commentators haveobserved. But what is the meaning and propriety of the name here, hasnot yet been shown. Justice Silence is here introduced as in the midstof his cups; and I remember a black-letter ballad, in which either a_San Domingo_ or a _Signior Domingo_, is celebrated for his miraculousfeats in drinking. Silence, in the abundance of his festivity, touchesupon some old song, in which this convivial _saint_, or _signior_, wasthe burden. Perhaps, too, the pronounciation in here suited to thecharacter." I must own that I cannot see what San Domingo has to do witha drinking song. May it not be an allusion to a ballad or song on_Domingo_, one of King Henry the Eighth's jesters?  "--_Domyngo Lomelyn_,  That was wont to wyn  Moche money of the kynge,  At the cardys and haserdynge."Skelton's _Why come ye not to Courte_, ed. Dyce, ii. p. 63.None of the commentators have noticed this, but I think my suggestioncarries with it some weight.In the _Privy Purse Expenses of King Henry the Eighth_ (published by SirH. Nichols, in 1827), are many entries concerning this _Domingo_, mostof which relate to payments of money that he had won from the king atcards and dice. He was evidently, as Sir Harris Nichols observes, one ofKing Henry's "diverting vagabonds," and seems to have accompanied hismajesty wherever he went, for we find that he was with him at Calais in1532. In all these entries he is only mentioned as Domingo; his surname,and the fact of his being a Lombard, we learn from Skelton's poem,mentioned above.The following story, told of _Domingo_, occurs in Mr. (afterwards SirJohn) Harington's _Treatise on Playe_, 1597, printed in the _NugaeAntiquae_, edit. Park, vol. i. p.222.:--     "The other tale I wold tell of a willinge and wise loss I have     hearde dyversly tolde. Some tell it of Kyng Phillip and a favoryte     of his; some of our worthy King Henry VIII. and _Domingo_; and I     may call it a tale; becawse perhappes it is but a tale, but thus     they tell it:--The kinge, 55 eldest hand, set up all restes, and     discarded flush; _Domingo_ or _Dundego_ (call him how you will),     helde it upon 49, or som such game; when all restes were up and     they had discarded, the kinge threw his 55 on the boord open, with     great lafter, supposing the game (as it was) in a manner     sewer. _Domingo_ was at his last carde incownterd flush, as the     standers by saw, and tolde the day after; but seeing the king so     mery, would not for a reste at primero, put him owt of that     pleasawnt conceyt, and put up his cardes quietly, yielding it     lost."Park was not acquainted with any particulars of this _Domingo Lomelyn_,for he says, in a note, "Query, jester to the king?"The first epigram in Samuel Rowland's entertaining tract, _The Lettingof Humours Blood in the Head-waine_, &c. 1600, is upon "MonsieurDomingo;" but whether it relates to King Henry's jester is a matter ofsome question.EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.       *       *       *       *       *MARLOWE AND THE OLD "TAMING OF A SHREW."Having only just observed an announcement of a new edition of the worksof Marlowe, I take the earliest opportunity of calling the attention ofthe editor to a circumstance which it is important that he should know,and the knowledge of which,--should it have escaped his notice, as ithas that of all other writers on the subject,--I trust may not be toolate for his present purpose. Without farther preface, I will introducethe subject, by asking Mr. Dyce to compare two passages which I shallshortly point out; and, having done so, I think he will agree with me inthe opinion that the internal evidence, relating to our old dramaticliterature, cannot have been very much studied, while such a discoveryas he will then make still remained to be made. The first passage isfrom the so-called _old "Taming of a Shrew"_ (six old plays, 1779, p.161.), and runs as follows:--  "Now that the gloomy shadow of the night,  Longing to view Orion's drisling looks,  Leaps from th' Antarctic world unto the sky,  And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath;"the second is from _Doctor Faustus_ (Marlowe's Works, vol. ii. p. 127.),which, however, I shall save myself the trouble of transcribing; as,with the exception of "look" for "looks," in the second line, and "his"for "her," in the fourth, the two passages will be found identical.Being, some years ago, engaged, in connection with the first of theseplays, in the pursuit of a very different object,--in which I cannot saythat I altogether failed, and the result of which I may take anopportunity of communicating,--I made a note of the above; and at thesame time followed it up by a general examination of the style ofMarlowe. And, to make a long matter short, I may say that in thisexamination, besides meeting with a dozen instances of the identity ofthe writer of passages in the _Taming of a Shrew_ and of passages inMarlowe's two plays, _Doctor Faustus_ and _Tamburlaine_, I found suchgeneral resemblance in style as left no doubt upon my mind that, if oneof these plays be his acknowledged work, as indisputable will be hisclaim to the other two. I was not aware at that time of the evidence, inHenslow's _Diary_, of Marlowe's authorship of _Tamburlaine_; but, so farfrom considering it inferior, I was inclined to place it, in someimportant respects, at the very head of his plays.I will not take up your space now with the parallel passages which Inoted; but, should you wish it, and be able to make room for them, Iwill furnish you with a list. It is, of course, obvious that the one Ihave quoted proves nothing by itself; accumulated instances, inconnection with the general question of style, alone become important. Iwill conclude, by giving a list which I have made out of Marlowe'splays, in favour of which I conceive there to be either internal orexternal evidence:--     "Locrine.     Tamburlaine the Great (two parts).     Jew of Malta.     Doctor Faustus.     Edward the Second.     Massacre of Paris.     Taming of a Shrew.     Dido, Queen of Carthage (with Nash)."SAMUEL HICKSONSt. John's Wood, Jan. 12. 1850     [We trust our correspondent will favour us with the further     communications he proposes on this very interesting point.]       *       *       *       *       *BEETLE MYTHOLOGY.Mr. Editor,--I never thought of asking my Low-Norman fellow-rusticswhether the ladybird had a name and a legend in the best preserved ofthe northern Romance dialects: on the score of a long absence(eight-and-twenty years), might not a veteran wanderer pleadforgiveness? Depend upon it, Sir, nevertheless, that should anyreminiscences exist among my chosen friends, the stout-hearted andindustrious tenants of a soil where every croft and paddock is the leafof a chronicle, it will be communicated without delay. There is morethan usual attractiveness in the astronomical German titles of this tiny"red chafer," or _rother kaefer_, SONNEN KAEFER and VNSER FRAWENKVHLEIN, the Sun-chafer, and our Lady's little cow. (_Isis_ or _Io?_)With regard to its provincial English name, _Barnabee_, the correctinterpretation might be found in _Barn-bie_, the burning, or fire-fly, acompound word of Low-Dutch origin.We have a small black beetle, common enough in summer, called PAN,nearly hemispherical: you must recollect that the _a_ is as broad as youcan afford to make it, and the final _n_ is nasal. Children neverforgot, whenever they caught this beetle, to place it in the palmof their left hand, when it was invoked as follows:--  "PAN, PAN, mourtre me ten sang,  Et j'te dourai de bouan vin blianc!"which means, being interpreted,  "PAN, PAN, show me thy blood,  And I will give thee good white wine!"As he uttered the charm, the juvenile pontiff spat on poor Thammuz, tilla torrent of blood, or what seemed such, "ran purple" over the urchin'sfingers.Paul-Ernest Jablonski's numerous readers need not be told that the saidbeetle is an Egyptian emblem of the everlasting and universal soul, andthat its temple is the equinoctial circle, the upper hemisphere.[1]As a solar emblem, it offers an instructive object of inquiry to thejudicious gleaners of the old world's fascinating nursery traditions.Sicilian Diodorus tells us that the earth's lover, Attis (or Adonis),after his resuscitation, acquired the divine title of PAPAN.[2] Tohazard the inoffensive query, why one of our commonest great beetles isstill allowed to figure under so distinguished a name, will thereforereflect no discredit upon a cautious student of nearly threescore years.The very Welsh talked, in William Baxter's time, of "Heaven, as_bugarth_ PAPAN," the sun's ox-stall or resting-place; and here youlikewise find his beetle-majesty, in a Low-Norman collection of insularrhymes:-- "Sus l'bord piasottaient, cote-a-cote,  Les equerbots et leas PAPANS,  Et ratte et rat laissaient leux crotte  Sus les vieilles casses et meme dedans."[3]By the help of Horapollo, Chiflet's gnostic gems, and other repertoriesof the same class, one might, peradventure, make a tolerable case infavour of the mythological identity of the legend of Ladybird--that is,the _sun-chafer_, or _barn-bie_, the _fire-fly_, "whose house is burnt,and whose bairns are ten," of course the first ten days of the Egyptianyear[4]--with the mystical stories of the said black or dark blue lordsof radiance, _Pan_ and _Papan_.The Egyptians revere the beetle as a living and breathing image of thesun, quoth Porphyry.[5] That will account for this restless delver'sextraordinary talismanic renown. I think the lady-bird is "the speckledbeetle" which was flung in hot water to avert storms.[6] Pignorius givesus the figure of the beetle, crowned with the sun, and encircled withthe serpent of eternity; while another, an onyx in the collection ofAbraham Gorlaeus, threatens to gnaw at a thunderbolt.[7]Reuven's book on the Egyptian Museum, which I have not seen, notices aninvocation to "the winged beetle, the monarch ([Greek: tyrannos]) ofmid-heaven," concluding with a devout wish that some poor creature "maybe dashed to pieces."Can any of your readers inform me what is meant by "the blood of the_Phuon_?"Yours truly,?St. Martin's, Guernsey, Jan. 9. 1850.       *       *       *       *       *EXTRACTS FROM CHURCHWARDENS' ACCOUNTS OF ST.

Lye and Thorpe have fallen in thepassage pointed out by Mr. Hampson in Aelfric's very interesting_Colloquy_, is the more remarkable as Aelfric himself afforded acomplete illustration of the passage, in his _Glossary_, where we have"BULGA, _hydig-faet_." It is possible, therefore, that _higdifatu_ is amere error of the scribe. Now Du Cange, v. _Bulga_, cites this verypassage from Aelfric's _Glossary_, and adds, "i.e. _vas ex corioconfectum_," but his whole article is worth consulting. That the Latinword in the _Colloquy_ should be _Cassidilia_ is quite clear. Thus in anold MS. English Gloss on the Bible (penes me), the passage in Tobit,viii. 2., "Protulit de _Cassidili_ suo," is rendered, "brouzt forth ofhis _Scrippe_." Coverdale has it, "take out of his _bagge_," and Luther,"langte aus seinem _Suecklein_," which word is exchanged for _buedel_ inthe Saxon version. In two old Teutonic Glosses on the Bible published byGraff (_Diutiska, ii. 178.), we have the following variations:--_de cassidi_ burssa, _de sacello t. sacciperio_ kiula_de cassili_ burissa, _de sacello t. sacciperio_ kiulla.Another Gloss in Graff's 1st vol. p. 192., on the word _Cadus_, mayperhaps throw some light on the subject. The philological student neednot be reminded of the wide application of the word _vas_, Lat., _fazz_,O.G., and _faet_. A.S.; but for my own part, I conclude that theshoewright intended to designate by _higdifatu_ all sorts of _leathernbudgets_. Every Anglo-Saxon student must be so sensible of the greatobligation he is under to our distinguished scholar Mr. Thorpe, that Itrust it will not be deemed invidious or ungracious to point out anotherpassage in this _Colloquy_ which seems to have hitherto baffled him, butwhich it appears to me may be elucidated.To the question, "Hwilce fixas gefehst thu?" the fisherman answers,"Aelas aud hacodas, mynas, aud aelputan, sceotan aud lampredan, aud swahwylce swa on waetere swymath, _sprote_."Mr. Thorpe, in the 1st edition of his _Analecta_, says, "What isintended to be meant by this word [_sprote_], as well as by _salu_ [thecorrespondent word in the Latin], I am at a loss to conjecture." In hissecond edition, Mr. Thorpe repeats, "I am unable to explain _salu_otherwise than by supposing it may be an error for _salice_. In his_Glossary_ he has "spro't, ii. 2.? sprout, rod?" with a reference to hisnote. I must confess I cannot see how the substitution of _salice_ for_salu_ would make the passage more intelligible, and the explanation of_spro'te_ in the _Glossary_ does not help us. The sense required appearsto me to be, _quickly, swiftly,_ and this will, I think, be found to bethe meaning of _sprote_. In the Moeso-Gothic Gospels the word _sprauto_occurs several times and always in the sense of _cito, subito_; andthough we have hitherto, I believe, no other example in Anglo-Saxon ofthis adverbial use of the word, we are warranted, I think, inconcluding, from the analogy of a cognate language, that it did exist.In regard to the evidently corrupt Latin word _salu_, I havenothing better to offer than the forlorn conjecture that, in monkishLatin, "_saltu't_" may have been contractedly written for _saltuatim_."Dr. Leo, in his _Angelsachsiche Sprachproben_, has reprinted the_Colloquy_, but without the Latin, and, among many other capriciousdeviations from Mr. Thorpe's text, in the answer of the shoewright hasprinted _hygefata_! but does not notice the word in his _Glossary_. HerrLeo has entirely omitted the word _sprote_.S.W. SINGER.Jan. 14. 1850.       *       *       *       *       *LOGOGRAPHIC PRINTING.     [NASO has, in compliance with our request, furnished us with a     facsimile of the heading of his early number of _The Times_, which     is as follows:--"THE (here an engraving of the King's Arms) TIMES,     OR DAILY UNIVERSAL REGISTER, PRINTED LOGOGRAPHICALLY, WEDNESDAY,     MARCH 12. 1788," and informs us that it was printed "By R. Nutkins,     at the Logographic Press, Printing-House Square, near Apothecaries'     Hall, Blackfriars," and the height to which the Mr. Walter of that     day had brought his invention, by the same energy by which his     successor has raised THE TIMES to its present position, is shown by     the following note from a kind and most able correspondent.]A much more remarkable specimen of Logographic Printing than the numberof the _Times_ newspaper mentioned by NASO, No. 9., p. 136., is anedition of Anderson's _History of Commerce_, with a continuation, in 4vols. 4to., printed by that method in 1787-1789, "at the LogographicPress, by J. Walter, Printing-House Square, Blackfriars." The work,which makes in all not much short of 4000 pages, is very well printed inall respects; and the following interesting note on the subject ofLogographic Printing is attached to the preface heading theContinuation, or fourth volume."Mr. Walter cannot here omit suggesting to the Public a few observationson his improved mode of printing LOGOGRAPHICALLY. In all projects forthe general benefit, the individual who conceives that the trade inwhich he is engaged diminishes in its emoluments from any improvementwhich another may produce in it, is too much disposed to become itsenemy; and, perhaps, the interest of individuals never exerted itselfwith more inveteracy than has been experienced by Mr. Walter from manyconcerned in the trade into which he had entered."The invention which he brought forward, promised to be of essentialservice to the public, by expediting the process and lessening theexpense of printing. Dr. Franklin sanctioned it with his approbation,and Sir Joseph Banks encouraged him with the most decided and animatedopinion of the great advantages which would arise to literature from theLOGOGRAPHIC PRESS. Nevertheless Mr. Walter was left to struggle with theinterest of some, and the prejudice of others, and, though he washonoured by the protection of several persons of high rank, it happenedin his predicament, as it generally happens in predicaments of a similarnature, that his foes were more active than his friends, and he stillcontinued to struggle with every difficulty that could arise from a verydetermined opposition to, and the most illiberal misrepresentations of,the LOGOGRAPHIC IMPROVEMENT."Mr. Walter has, however, at length triumphed over the falsehood andmalignity of his opponents; LOGOGRAPHIC PRINTING, after having producedsuch a work as this, which he now presents to the public, with manyexcellent publications that he has already printed, can no longer beconsidered as an idle speculation: on the contrary, it is proved to be apractical improvement, that promises, under a due encouragement, toproduce a great national benefit. To advance it to the perfection ofwhich it is capable, Mr. Walter engages to employ his utmost exertions,and he takes the liberty of expressing his confidence, that he shall notbe disappointed in the enjoyment of that public favour which nowpromises to reward his labours."C.Old Brompton, Jan. 3. 1850.     [We may mention another work printed in this manner--an edition of     _Robinson Crusoe_, in 3 vols. 8vo. 1790--_"printed at the     Logographic Press, and sold by J. Walter, No. 169. Piccadilly,     opposite Old Bond Street."_]       *       *       *       *       *MEMORIALS OF THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH'S LAST DAYS.[9]At a recent meeting of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, Dr. Ansterexhibited a manuscript volume of 157 pages, which he declared to be theidentical "album filled with songs, recipes, prayers, and charms," foundin the Duke of Monmouth's pocket when he was seized. It was purchased ata book-stall in Paris in 1827 by an Irish divinity student, was given byhim to a priest in the county of Kerry, and, on the priest's death,became the property of the present possessor. Respecting in its identityand history, from its removal from the rebel duke's pocket down to itsproduction at the Royal Irish Academy, Dr. Anster showed that afterMonmouth was beheaded--which he was on Tower Hill, by the too-celebratedJohn Ketch, on the 15th July, 1685--the articles found on his personwere given to the king. At James's deposition, three years afterwards,all his manuscripts, including those that had belonged to Monmouth, werecarried into France, where they remained till the Revolution in thatcountry a century afterwards. Dr. Anster, in exhibiting the book,showed that the remains of silver clasps had been destroyed, and a partof the leather of the covers at each side torn away, seemingly for thepurpose of removing some name on a coat of arms with which it had beenonce marked; and this he accounted for by the belief that at the periodof the French Revolution the persons in whose custody they were, beingfearful of the suspicions likely to arise from their possession of bookswith royal arms on them, tore off the covers, and sent the books to St.Omer's. The after-fate of the larger books was, that they were burned;some small ones, we are distinctly told, were saved from this fate, butseem to have been disregarded, and all trace of them lost. The AbbeWaters--a collateral descendant of Lucy Waters, the Duke of Monmouth'smother--was the person with whom George IV. negotiated for the Stuartpapers, and from whom the volumes which have since appeared as Clark's_Life of James the Second_ were obtained; and it is from the Abbe Waterswe have the account of the destruction of King James's autograph papers.Dr. Anster showed, written on the inner cover of this volume, the words,"Baron Watiers" or "Watrers."As to the identity of the book, Dr. Anster quoted several passages fromcontemporary authors to test their account of the contents of the"album" with those of the book he was describing. In the _HarleianMiscellany_, vol. vi. p.323., it is stated in Sir John Reresby'smemoirs, that "out of his [Monmouth's] pocket were taken books, in hisown handwriting, containing charms or spells to open the doors of aprison, to obviate the danger of being wounded in battle, together withsongs and prayers." Barillon describes the book in what is nearly atranslation of this--"Il y avoit des secrets de magie et d'enchantment,avec des chansons des recettes pour des maladies et des prieres." Again,in a note by Lord Dartmouth to the modern editions of _Burnet's OwnTimes_, we have the following statement:--     "My uncle Colonel William Legge, who went in the coach with him     [Monmouth] to London as a guard, with orders to stab him if there     were any disorders on the road, showed me several charms that were     tied about him when he was taken, and his table-book, which was     full of astrological figures that nobody could understand; but he     told my uncle that they had been given to him some years before in     Scotland, and he now found they were but foolish conceits."The actual contents of the manuscript volume show a great resemblance tothese descriptions. The most curious passages which it contains are theduke's memorandums of his journey on two visits to the Prince of Orange,in the year previous to his last rash adventure. His movements up to the14th of March, 1684-85, are given. The entries do not seem to be of muchmoment; but they may accidentally confirm or disprove some disputedpoints of history. There is an entry without a date, describing thestages of a journey in England, commencing with London and Hampstead: itends with Toddington. This forms a strong link in the chain of identity;for Toddington is a place remarkable in the history of the duke. Near itwas the residence of Lady Henrietta Maria Wentworth, baroness (in herown right) of Nettlestead, only daughter and heir of Thomas LordWentworth, grandchild and heir of the Earl of Cleveland. Five yearsbefore the execution, her mother observed that, despite the duke being amarried man, her daughter had, while at court, attracted his admiration,and she hurried her away to Toddington. In 1683, after the failure ofthe Rye-House Plot, Monmouth was banished from the royal presence, andit was to Toddington he retired. When, on retracting the confession hehad made on the occasion, he was banished the kingdom, the companion ofhis exile was Lady Henrietta Wentworth."I dwell on this," said Dr. Anster, "because the accidental mention ofToddington seems to authenticate the book: the name of Lady HenriettaWentworth does not occur in it, and the persons in whose hands the bookhas been since it was purchased in Paris do not seem to have noticed thename of Toddington, or to have known that it had any peculiar relationto the duke's history. It occurs twice in the book--once in theitinerary, and again in a trifling and unmetrical song, which isprobably the duke's own composition; written probably on the eve of hisflight with his romantic but guilty companion to Holland:--  "'With joy we leave thee,  False world, and do forgive  All thy false treachery.  For now we'll happy live.  We'll to our bowers,  And there spend our hours;  Happy there we'll be,  We no strifes can see;  No quarrelling for crowns,  Nor fear the great one's frowns;  Nor slavery of state,  Nor changes in our fate.  From plots this place is free,  There we'll ever be;  We'll sit and bless our stars  That from the noise of wars  Did this glorious place give  (Or did us Toddington give)  That thus we happy live.'"In Macaulay's history we find that the latest act of the duke on thescaffold, before submitting to the stroke of the executioner, was tocall his servant, and put into the man's hand a toothpick-case, the lasttoken of ill-starred love. "Give it," he said, "_to that person!_" Afterthe description of Monmouth's burial occurs the following affectingpassage:--     "Yet a few months and the quiet village of Toddington, in     Bedfordshire, witnessed a yet sadder funeral. Near that village     stood an ancient and stately hall, the seat of the Wentworths. The     transept of the parish church had long been their burial-place. To     that burial-place, in the spring which followed the death of     Monmouth, was borne the coffin of the young Baroness Wentworth of     Nettlestead. Her family reared a sumptuous mausoleum over her     remains; but a less costly memorial of her was long contemplated     with far deeper interest: her name, carved by the hand of him she     loved too well, was, a few years ago, still discernible on a tree     in the adjoining park."In further proof of identity, Dr. Anster pointed out several charms andrecipes which the manuscript volume contains. The conjurations are ingeneral for the purpose of learning the results of sickness in anyparticular case, and of determining whether friends will be in certaincircumstances faithful. There are also incantations for the use ofseveral maladies, and one to make gray hair grow black. No "charmsagainst being wounded in battle," such are Sir John Reresby mentions,are to be found in the volume; but there are some prayers againstviolent death, which have the appearance of having been transcribed fromsome devotional book. There is evidently a mistake in supposing thatthis book contains any charm for breaking open prison doors, and it islikely that Sir John Reresby was misled in this way:--There is in p. 7.a charm in French to procure repose of body and mind, and deliverancefrom pains; and the word for "pains" is written in a contracted form; itmight as well stand for prisons; but, examining the context, it isplainly the former word which is meant.The rest of the entries consist of extracts from old recipe-books, mixedin the oddest way with abridgements of English history, and the mosttrifling memorandums, chiefly of a private and personal kind.Altogether, this commonplace work is highly indicative of the weakness,vanity, and superstition which stood forward so prominently in thecharacter of the rash but unfortunate Duke of Monmouth.       *       *       *       *       *QUERIES.CATHERINE PEGGE.Mr. Cunningham was mistaken in supposing that I had overlooked CatherinePegge, for I was well aware that she could not have been Pepys's "prettyLady." She must, in fact, have attained her fortieth year, and there isno record of her being on the stage; whereas Margaret Hughes had, whenPepys saluted her, recently joined the Theatre Royal, and she isexpressly styled "Peg Hughes" by Tom Browne, in one of his "Letters fromthe Dead to the Living." Having disposed of this question, I am temptedto add that Morant does not confirm the statement that Catherine Peggemarried Sir Edward Green, for he says that     "Sir Edward Greene, created a Baronet, 26 July, 1660, was seated at     Little Sampford in Essex; he had 3 wives, the first was Jeronyma,     daughter and coheir of William Everard, of Linsted, Esq., and by     her he had 6 daughters; by Mary, daughter of ---- Tasborough, he     had a son; and by the third lady ----, daughter of ---- Simonds, he     had a daughter. He was the last of the Greenes that enjoyed this     estate, having lost it by gaming."--Morant's _Essex_, vol. ii. p.     525.This account of the Greene family is stated in a note to have been takenfrom a fine pedigree on vellum, penes T. Wotton, Gent.If Catherine Pegge was one the three ladies mentioned above, she musthave changed her name previously to her marriage, in hopes of concealingher former history; but the circumstance of the baronetcy beingconferred upon Sir Edward is very suspicious. Probably some of yourcorrespondents can settle the question.BRAYBROOKE.Audley End, Jan. 19. 1850.       *       *       *       *       *WILLIAM BASSE, AND HIS POEMS.Can any of your readers inform me where a perfect or imperfect copy isto be found of a poem, of which I possess only a single half sheet,under the following title:--     "_Great Brittaines Sunnes-set, bewailed with a Shower of Teares_.     By William Basse. At Oxford, Printed by Joseph Barnes. 1613"?It is one of the many poems published on the death of Prince Henry; andalthough I have been in search of it, or of a fragment of it, for morethan twenty years, I have never been able to obtain tidings of more thanof that small portion in my possession; nor am I aware of the mention ofit in any bibliographical authority. I have not at hand Sir H. Nicolas'sedition of Walton's _Angler_, in which Basse is spoken of, but Iremember looking at that beautiful and costly work a long time ago, and,as far as I recollect, not finding in it anything to my purpose. Iobserve that a William Basse (or _Bas_, as the name is there spelt)printed in 1602, 4to., a tract called _Sword and Buckler, or ServingMan's Defence_; but I know no more of it than that it was sold inStevens's sale; and among the MSS. of the late Mr. Heber was a volumeof poems called _Polyhymnia_, apparently prepared for the press, anddedicated by William Basse to Lady Lindsey, which contained an "Elegieon a rare Singing Bull-finch," dated 19th June, 1648; so that he wasstill living nearly half a century after he had printed his earliestknown performance.The production that Izaac Walton refers to must be the ballad preservedin the Pepys Collection at Cambridge, under the heading "MaisterBasse his Careere, or the new Hunting of the Hare. To a new Court tune;"and beginning--  "Long ere the morne expects the returne."It was "Printed at London by E.A.," i.e. Edward Allde, without date; andit may have been duly noticed by the last editor of _The CompleteAngler_. However, neither this nor Heber's MS. throw any new light uponthe small tract (in 8vo., and of perhaps not more than two sheets) withthe title of which I commenced, and regarding which I requestinformation. It is a poem in eight-line stanzas, and it is dedicated, atthe back of the title-page, "To his honourable Master, Sir RichardWenman, Knight," without another word addressed to his patron.My fragment of four leaves, or half an 8vo. sheet, contains stanzas (oneon each page), numbered 5, 6, 7, 8. 13, 14.; and the earliest of them isthis:--    "To you I therefore weepe: To you alone    I shew the image of your teares, in mine;    That mine (by shewing your teares) may be show'n    To be like yours, so faithfull so divine:    Such as more make the publique woe their owne,    Then their woe publique, such as not confine  Themselves to times, nor yet forms from examples borrow:  Where losse is infinit, there boundlesse is the sorrow."I have preserved even the printer's punctuation, for the sake of moreperfect identification, if any of your readers are acquainted with theexistence of a copy of the production, or of any portion of it. Theabove stanza, being numbered "5," of course it was preceded by fourothers, of which I can give no account. Another stanza, from thisliterary and bibliographical rarity, may not be unacceptable; it is theeighth--    "Here then run forth thou River of my woes    In cease lesse currents of complaining verse:    Here weepe (young Muse) while elder pens compose    More solemne Rites unto his sacread Hearse.    And, as when happy earth did, here, enclose    His heavn'ly minde, his Fame then Heav'n did pierce.  Now He in Heav'n doth rest, now let his Fame earth fill;  So, both him then posses'd: so both possesse him still."Therefore, although Basse had written his _Sword and Buckler_ in 1602(if it were the same man), he still called his Muse "young" in 1613. Icannot call to mind any precedent for the form of stanza adopted by him,consisting, as it does, of six ten-syllable lines, rhyming alternately,followed by a twelve-syllable couplet. None of the other stanzas containpersonal matter; the grief of the author of _Great Britain's Sun's-set_seems as artificial as might be expected; and his tears were probablybrought to the surface by the usual pecuniary force-pump.I have some notion that William Basse was a musical composer, as well asa writer of verses; but here, again, I am at fault, and particularlyrequest the aid of Dr. Rimbault, who has paid special attention to suchmatters, and who has just published a learned and valuable work on themusic of the ballads in Percy's _Reliques_. If the volume were not soindisputably excellent in its kind, there are reasons, connected withits dedication, which might make me hesitate in giving it even a justtribute of praise.J. PAYNE COLLIER.Kensington, Jan. 21. 1850.       *       *       *       *       *MINOR QUERIES._Christmas Hymn_.--Can any of your readers inform me who was the authorof the well-known Christmas Hymn, "Hark the Herald Angels sing," whichis so often found (of course without the slightest shadow of authority),at the end of our Prayer-Books? In the collection of poems entitled_Christmas Tyde_, published by Pickering, the initials "J.C.W." areappended to it; the same in Bickersteth's _Hymn Book_. In the lastnumber of the _Christian Remembrancer_, it is incorrectly attributed toDoddridge, who was the author of the other Christmas Hymn, "High let usswell our tuneful notes," frequently appended to Tate and Brady; as wellas of the Sacramental Hymn, "My God and is Thy table spread?" If theauthor of this hymn cannot be determined, it would be interesting toknow its probable date, and the time when this and the otherunauthorised additions were made to our Prayer-Book. The case ofDoddridge's hymn is more remarkable, as being the composition of adissenter.E.V._On a Passage in Pope_.--"P.C.S.S.," who is old-fashioned enough toadmire and to study Pope, would feel greatly obliged if any of yourcorrespondents could help him to the interpretation of the followinglines, in the "Imitation" of Horace's _Epistle to Augustus_:--  "The Hero William, and the Martyr Charles,  One knighted Blackmore, and one pensioned Quarles,  Which made old Ben, and sturdy Dennis swear,  _No Lord's Annointed, but a Russian bear!_"The passage in Horace, of which this purports to be an "Imitation," isthe well-known"Boeotum in crasso jurares aeere natum,"and it is clear enough that Pope meant to represent kings Charles andWilliam as so devoid of the taste which should guide royal patronage,that, in selecting such objects of their favour as Blackmore andQuarles, they showed themselves to be as uncouth and unpolished as theanimal to which he likens them. But the principal motive of this inquiryis to ascertain whether there exist in their writings any recordof the indignation supposed to have been expressed by Jonson and Dennisat the favour shown by majesty to their less worthy rivals.P.C.S.S._Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood_.--There is a passage inLonginus (ch. xxii.), familiar perhaps to some of the readers of the"NOTES AND QUERIES," which indicates that the fact of the circulation ofthe blood was well established in the days of Plato. The father ofcritics, to exemplify, and illustrate the use and value of _trope_ inwriting, has garbled from the Timaeus, a number of sentences descriptiveof the anatomy of the human body, where the circulation of the blood ispointed at in terms singularly graphic. The exact extent of professionalknowledge arrived at in the time of the great philosopher is by no meansclearly defined: he speaks of the fact, however, not with a view toprove what was contested or chimerical, but avails himself of it tofigure out the surpassing wisdom of the gods in constructing the humanframe. Perhaps some of the readers of the "NOTES," who are morethoroughly conversant with the subject, may think it worth while toinquire how much was known on that subject before Harvey wrote his_Exercitationes Anatomiae_. The _Prooemium_ of that author seems hardlysufficient to satisfy the desire of every reader, who has looked withsome care to the passage in Longinus to which I have taken the libertyof calling public attention.A.W.Brighton._The Meaning of "Pallace_."--A lease granted by the corporation ofTotness in Devon, in the year 1703, demises premises by thisdescription: "All that cellar and the chambers over the same, and thelittle _pallace_ and landing-place adjoining to the river Dart." Canyour readers give an explanation of the term "pallace?"J.R. ROGERS._Did Oliver Cromwell write "The New Star of the North?_"--Perhaps someof your numerous correspondents, who have perused a curious letter ofCount de Tessins, in Clements' _Bibliotheque Curieuse_, tome ix. page331., can inform me what credit, or if any, is due to the Count'sconjecture, that Oliver Cromwell was the author of the book entitled_The New Star of the North, shining upon the victorious King of Sweden_,&c. 4to. London, 1632.J.M.Oxford._Meaning of Savegard and Russells_.--In the will of ElizabethCoddington, lady of the manor of Ixworth, 1571, mention is made of "thered _russells_ quilt," of "a felde bed," and of "my cloke and _savegardof freseadon_." I shall be obliged by any description of the garmentknown as the _savegard_, and of the _russells quilt_.BURIENSIS._Pandoxare_.--Having met with an old volume containing the entirehousehold expenses, as well as in some degree a diary, kept by a countrygentleman during the reigns of James II., William and Mary, and Anne, Iobserved that he has made use of a species of hieroglyphics, tofacilitate his reference to his book, as it contained all the entries ofall kinds, in chronological order. For instance, where mention is madeof money spent on behalf of one person in his house, he puts at the sideof the page a clay pipe, rudely drawn; an entry of the payment of wagesto another servant has a jug of ale; another a quill pen; another acouple of brooms, as the housemaid; a fiddle for the dancing master forhis daughter; payment made to the sexton or parish-clerk has arepresentation of the village church by its side, and the window-tax asmall lattice-window; and on the days that they brewed, a small barrelis drawn by the side of the date. And the chief object of my letter iswith respect to this last; a barrel is often drawn, and by its side thewords, _primo relinitus_, and the date, naturally meaning the day it wastapped; and then shortly after comes another barrel, and to it iswritten the word _Pandox_., or sometimes in full _Pandoxavimus_; in someplaces at the end of the year there is a list to this effect:--                    "(1705.)

[Ducange explains _Pandoxare_ "Cauponum exercere, agere; cerevisiam     venum exponere atque adeo conficere."]_Lord Bacon's Metrical Version of the Psalms_.--In old Izaak Walton's_Life of George Herbert_, I find the following passage:--     "He (_i.e._ Lord Bacon) thought him so worthy of his friendship,     that having translated many of the Prophet David's Psalms into     English verse, he made George Herbert his patron by a public     dedication of them to him, as the best judge of divine poetry."Can any one of your numerous readers inform me if these "Metricals" areknown?--if so it will greatly obligeA CORNISHMAN._Festival of St. Michael and All Angels_.--Can any of your readersinform me why double second lessons are appointed in the Book ofCommon Prayer for the Festival of St. Michael and All Angels? First,among the "lessons proper for Holy-days," we have, at Matins, Acts xii.to v. 20.; and at Evensong, Jude, v.6 to v.16.: and then in theCalendar, coming in ordinary course, we have, at Morning Prayer, Mark.ii.; and at evening, 1 Cor. xiv. In every other case, where the secondlessons are proper, there are none appointed in the Calendar in ordinarycourse.K.M.P._Wood-cut Likeness of Luther and Erasmus_.--Perhaps you will permit meto inquire what are the earliest wood-cut likenesses of Luther andErasmus. Am I right in supposing that the image of the great Reformer isfound for the first time on the verse of the title-page of his treatise_De Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae_, 4to., s.l.v.a.; and that thewished-for representation of Erasmus may be seen in the small octavovolume, entitled _Bellaria Epistolarum Erasmi Rot. et Ambrosii Pelargivicissim missarum_, Colon. 1539? Some of your readers will doubtless beacquainted with what seems to be a very accurate and completeperformance, the _Vita D. Martini Lutheri Nummis atque Inconibusillustrata_, studio M. Christiani Juncker, 8vo., Francof. 1699. In thiswork (p.129.) there is an impression of a medal on which was exhibitedthe _Imago ad vivam effigiem expressa_ of Erasmus, anno 1531.R.G._Anglo-Saxon "Lay of the Phoenix_."--Has any edition of the _Lay of thePhoenix_ been published, besides the English version in the_Archaeologia_, vol. 30, and that which bears the date, "Copenhagen,Grundtvig, 1840, 8vo"? Can any light be thrown on the doubts respectingthe era of the author of this lay? And is there any published edition ofthe hexameter poem by Lactantius, which is said by Stephens to havesuggested the first idea of this beautiful Anglo-Saxon poem?SELEUCUS._C. Agricola, Propugnaculum Anti-Pistorianum_.--Could any of yourreaders direct me to an accessible library which possess a copy ofChristian Agricola's _Propugnaculum Anti-Pistorianum_, or otherwise giveme any account of that treatise?J. SANSOM._The Liturgy Version of the Psalms_.--In Beloe's _Anecdotes ofLiterature_ (edition 1807), vol. i. p. 181. and vol. ii. p.316. arenotices of _The Bishops' Bible_, where mention is made of one edition ofit containing two different versions of the Psalms. The two statements,however, differ, making it doubtful of what is intended; the firstspeaking of one edition and the second of another.Vol. i. p. 181. says--     "The first edition of this Bible was published in 1568. In this the     new translation of the Psalms was inserted alone. In the second     edition the translation of the Great Bible was added in opposite     columns, and in a different character."Vol. ii. p. 316.:--     "Bishops' Bible, first edition, 1568. There is also a double     translation of the Psalms, one from what is called the Great Bible,     the other entirely a new one."Will any of your correspondents be so obliging as to state what is theadditional version--new or other--there alluded to, other than thepresent Liturgy version?X.X.       *       *       *       *       *MISCELLANIES._Sir William Rider_.--"P.C.S.S." is happy to be able to answer one ofthe questions of "H.F." (at p. 186. No. 12.), by referring him to the_Extracts from the Parish Registers of St. Olave's_, which werepublished in vol. ii. of the _Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica_.At p. 316., of that volume, he will find the following entry, whichpretty nearly determines the date of Sir William Rider's death:--"1611,November 19. Sir William Rider diing at Leyton, had his funerallesolemnized in our Church, the hearss being brought from Clothworkers'Hall." In a note to the above entry a further reference is made toLyson's _Environs_, vol. iv. pp. 160, 161. 165.SONNET._Written on the opening of the Session_, 1847.

See Watt's _Bibliotheca Brit_., vol. iii.p. 612.No. 11., p. 167.

A demi-lion sable, charged with three bezants.BURIENSIS._Lacedaemonian Black Broth_.--Your correspondent "W." in No. 11., isamusing as well as instructive; but it does not yet appear that we mustreject the notion of coffee as an ingredient of the Lacedaemonian blackbroth upon the score of _colour_ or _taste_.That it _was_ an ingredient has only as yet been mooted as a_probability_.Pollux, to whom your correspondent refers us, says that [Greek: zomosmelas] was a Lacedaemonian food; and that it was called [Greek:aimatia], translated in Scott and Liddell's _Lexicon_, "_blood-broth_."These lexicographers add, "The Spartan black broth was made with blood,"and refer to Manso's _Sparta_, a German work, which I have not theadvantage of consulting.Gesner, in his _Thesaurus_, upon the word "jus," quotes the knownpassage of Cicero, _Tusc. Disp_. v. 34., and thinks the "jus nigrum" wasprobably the [Greek: aimatia], and made with an admixture of blood, asthe "botuli," the _black_ puddings of modern time, were.Coffee would not be of much lighter colour than blood. A decoction ofsenna, though of a red-brown, is sometimes administered in medicineunder the common name of a "_black_ dose."As regards the _colour_, then, whether blood or coffee were theingredient, the mess would be sufficiently dark to be called "_black_."In respect of _taste_, it is well known, from the story told by Ciceroin the passage above referred to, that the Lacedaemonian black broth was_disagreeable_, at least to Dionysius, and the Lacedaemonians, whoobserved to him that he wanted that best of sauces, hunger, convey aconfession that their broth was not easily relished.The same story is told with a little variation by Stobaeus, _Serm_.xxix., and Plutarch, _Institut. Lacon_., 2. The latter writer says, thatthe Syracusan, having tasted the Spartan broth, "spat it out indisgust," [Greek: dyscheranunta apoptusai].It would not have been unlike the Lacedaemonians purposely to haveestablished a disagreeable viand in their system of public feeding. Menthat used iron money to prevent the accumulation of wealth, and, asyouths, had volunteered to be scourged, scratched, beat about, andkicked about, to inure them to pain, were just the persons to affect anauseous food to discipline the appetite.R.O._Lacedaemonian Black Broth_.--I should be glad to know in what passagesof ancient authors the Lacedaemonian black broth is mentioned, andwhether it is alluded to in such terms as to indicate the nature of thefood. It has occurred to me that it is much more probable that it wasthe same _black broth_ which is now cooked in Greece, where I have eatenof it and found it very good, although it looked as if a bottle of inkhad been poured into the mess.The dish is composed of small cuttle-fish (with their ink-bags) boiledwith rice or other vegetables. Edinburgh, Jan. 13. 1850.W.C. TREVELYAN.ON A LADY WHO WAS PAINTED. (_From the Latin._)  It sounds like a paradox--and yet 'tis true,  You're like your picture, though it's not like you.RUFUS._Bigotry._--The word Bigotry pervades almost all the languages ofEurope, but its etymology has not been satisfactory to Noah Webster. Theapplication of it is generally intelligible enough; being directedagainst those who pertinaciously adhere to their own system of religiousfaith. But as early as the tenth century it appears, that the use of theword Bigot originated in a circumstance, or incident, unconnected withreligious views. An old chronicle, published by Duchesne in the 3rd vol.of his _Hist. Francorum Scriptores_, states that Rollo, on receivingNormandy from the King of France, or at least of that part of it, wascalled upon to kiss the foot of the king, a ceremony, it seems, in usenot at the Vatican only; but he refused "unless the king would raise hisfoot to his mouth." When the counts in attendance admonished him tocomply with this usual form of accepting so valuable a fief, he stilldeclined, exclaiming in pure Anglo-Saxon, "Not He, By God,"--_Nese bigoth_; "quod interpetatur," says the chronicler, "non [ille] perDeum." The king and his peers, deriding him, called him afterwardsBigoth, or Bigot, instead of Rollo. "Unde Normanni," adds the writer,who brings his history down to the year 1137, "adhuc Bigothi dicuntur."This will account for the prepositive article "Le" prefixed to theNorman Bigods, the descendants of those who followed William theConqueror into England, such as Hugh Le Bigod, &c. Among otherinnovations in France, the word Bigotisme has been introduced, of whichBoiste gives an example as combined with Philosophisme:--"Le Bigotismen'est, comme le Philosophisme, qu'un Egoisme systematique. LePhilosophisme et le Bigotisme se traitent comme les chiens et les loups;cependant leurs especes se rapprochent, et produisent des monstres."J.I.Oxford._Gowghe's Dore of Holy Scripture_.--If your correspondent "F.M." (No. 9.p.139.) has not received a reply to his third query, I beg to submitthat he will find the perusers of Gowghe's work to be the individualsmentioned in different portions of Foxe's _Acts and Monuments_, vol. v.edit. 8vo. pp. 414.449. 482.; the less intelligible names, "DoctorBarons, Master Ceton," being intended for Dr. Barnes and AlexanderSeton. Anyhow, this reference may, it is hoped, lead to a fullerdiscovery of the parties intended.NORRIS._Reinerius Saccho_.--Your correspondent "D." (No. 7. p.106.) will findsome account of Reinerius Saccho, if the source is accessible, in Quetifand Echard's _Scriptores Ord. Praedicatt_. tom. i. 154.N._Discurs Modest_.--Your correspondent "A.T." (No.9. p.142) may beinformed that there can be no reasonable doubt, that the _original_authority, for _Rem transubstantiationis patres ne attigisse quidem_, isWilliam Watson in his _Quodlibet_, ii. 4. p.31.; that the _Discurs.Modest. de Jesuitis_ borrowed it from him; that Andrews _most probably_derived it from the borrower; and that the date of the _Discurs_. &c.must, therefore, be between 1602 and 1610. Probably there may be a copyin the Lambeth Library; there is none in the Bodleian, British Museum,or Sion College, and Placcius affords no reference. The _author_ maynever have been known.N._Defoe's Tour through Great Britain_.--I am much obliged to yourcorrespondent "D.S.Y" for the suggestion that the _Tour through GreatBritain, by a Gentleman_, from which I sent you some extracts relatingto the Ironworks of Sussex, is from the pen of Daniel Defoe. Onreferring to the list of his writings, given in vol. xx. of C. Talboy'sedition of Defoe's Works, I find this idea is correct. Chalmers noticesthree editions of the work, in 1724, 1725, and 1727, (numbered in hislist "154," "156," "163,") and remarks that "all the subsequent editionsvary considerably from the original" of 1724. He states that "this workis frequently confounded with 'John Macky's Journey through England, infamiliar Letters from a Gentleman here to his Friend abroad,' 1722." Imay take this opportunity of mentioning that, in the first volume ofDefoe's work, there are some very interesting particulars of theskirmish at Reading, between the troops of the Prince of Orange and theIrish forces of James II., and the panic known as the "Irish night,"which deserve to be consulted by Mr. Macaulay, for the next edition ofhis History. The whole work will well repay a perusal, and what is thereof Defoe's writing which will not?D.S._Muffins_.--The correspondent who, in No. 11., p. 173., inquires theorigin of the word "Muffin," is referred to Urquhart's _Pillars ofHercules_, vol. ii. p. 143., just published, where he will find a largeexcursus on this subject. The word, he avers, is _Phoenician_: from_maphula_, one of those kinds of bread named as such by Athenaeus. "Itwas a _cake_," says Athenaeus, "baked on a hearth or griddle." Hederives this by taking away the final vowel, and then changing _l_ for_n_; thus: "maphula," "maphul," "mufun!!!"In this strange book there are fifty other etymologies as remarkable asthis. The author plainly offers them in hard earnest. This is somethingworth _noting_.V._By Hook or Crook_.--"As in the phrase 'to get by hook or crook;' in thesense of, to get by any expedient, to stick at nothing to obtain theend; not to be over nice in obtaining your ends--_By hucke o'er krooke_;e.g. _by bending the knees, and by bowing low_, or as we now say, bybowing and scraping, by crouching and cringing."--Bellenden Ker's_Essay on the Archaeology our Popular Phrases and Nursery Rhymes_, vol.i. p. 21. ed. 1837.I wish your correspondent, "J.R.F.," had given a reference to the bookor charter from which he copied his note.Has Mr. B. Ker's work ever been reviewed?MELANION.     [Mr. Ker's book was certainly reviewed in _Fraser's Magazine_ at     the time of its appearance, and probably in other literary     journals.]_By Hook or By Crook_.--I have met with it somewhere, but have lost mynote, that Hooke and Crooke were two judges, who in their day decidedmost unconscientiously whenever the interests of the crown wereaffected, and it used to be said that the king could get anything byHooke or by Crooke. Query, is _this_ the origin of the phrase?If I cannot give _my_ authority, perhaps "J.R.F." may be able to give_his_, for deriving it from "_Forest Customs_?"H.T.E._El Buscapie_.--A very full and able disquisition on the subject of MR.SINGER's query (No. 11., p. 171.), respecting _El Buscapie_, will befound in the appendix to a work which is just published, viz. Ticknor's_History of Spanish Literature_, vol. iii. Appendix D. 371. _et seq_.That writer, whose opinion is entitled to credit as that of a consummatestudent of Spanish letters, and who gives good reasons for hisconclusions in this instance, pronounces against the authenticity of thepoor little pamphlet recently put forth as belonging to Cervantes.Those who take an interest in Spanish literature will find this book ofTicknor's a most valuable contribution to their knowledge of its wholecompass, and worth "making a note of."V._Richard of Cirencester, &c.--Bishop Barlow_.--Your correspondent"S.A.A." (No. 6., p. 93), who is desirous of further informationrespecting Richard of Cirencester, will, I am sure, peruse with muchinterest and gratification a dissertation on that writer by K. Wex,which first appeared in the _Rheinisches Museum fuer Philologie_ for1846, and was shortly after translated and inserted in the _Gentleman'sMagazine_, with valuable notes by the translator.--Respecting thewriters of notes on the margin of books, few notes of the kind, Iapprehend, deserve better to be collected and published than those bythe very learned Bishop Barlow, Provost of Queen's College from the year1657 to 1677, and who left the chief part of his library to thatsociety. The rest of his books, being such as were not in the Bodleian,he bequeathed to that library, of which he was for some years thelibrarian. The _Biographia Britannica_ represents him to have been "anuniversal lover and favourer of learned men, of what country ordenomination soever."J.M.Oxford_Rev. J. Edwards on Metal for Telescopes_.--"T.J." informs thecorrespondent who inquired (No. 11, p. 174.) respecting this valuablepaper, that it was printed in the _Nautical Almanac_ for 1787. E.B.PRICE adds, "_A Treatise on Optical Instruments_, published about twentyyears ago by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, containsmuch useful and general information upon this subject; and it is statedin that work that Mr. Edward's treatise, which is now very scarce, isrepublishing in the _Technological Repository_." While "G.B.S."furnishes the information that the treatise in question may be procuredfrom Mr. Murray, of Albemarle Street._Ordination Pledges_.--In reply to the inquiry of "CLERICUS" (No. 10.,p. 156.) for manuals containing a complete list of Ordination Pledges,may be mentioned Johnson's _Clergyman's Vade Mecum_, 2 vols. 12mo., andWilliam's _Laws relating to the Clergy, being a Practical Guide to theClerical Profession on the Legal and Canonical Discharge of theirvarious Duties_, 8vo. The author of this useful work, which appears notto have been seen by Lowndes, says, in his advertisement, "The workswhich are already extant on Ecclesiastical Law, being either too diffuseor too concise for ready reference and practical use, the compiler ofthis volume has endeavored to remedy this defect by the publication ofthe following compendium."T.J.       *       *       *       *       *NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.The Percy Society have just issued _A New and Mery Enterlude called theTriall of Treasure_, from the edition printed at London by ThomasPurfoote, 1567, edited by Mr. Halliwell. The other works issued by theSociety since May last (when the year's subscription became due) havebeen _A Poem_ (satirical) _of The Times of Edward II_., edited by theRev. C. Hardwick, from a MS. at St. Peter's College, Cambridge, of whicha less perfect copy from an Edinburgh MS. was printed by Mr. Wright, inthe volume of _Political Songs_, edited by him for the Camden Society;_Notices of Fugitive Tracts and Chap-Books, printed at AldermaryChurchyard, Bow Churchyard, &c._ by Mr. Halliwell; _The Man in theMoone, or The English Fortune Teller_, edited by the same gentleman,from the unique copy printed in 1609, now in the Bodleian; and lastly,_The Religious Poems of William de Shoreham, Vicar of Chart-Sutton inKent, in the Reign of Edward II_., edited by Mr. Wright, from acontemporary manuscript.It is doubtful whether Mr. Shaw's skill as an artist, fidelity as acopyist, or taste in the selection of his subjects, entitle him to thehigher praise. We leave to those who are familiar with his _Dresses andDecorations of the Middle Ages_, and other admirable productions, thesettlement of this point. He has just published the first number of anew work, _The Decorative Arts of the Middle Ages_, the object of whichis to exhibit the peculiar features and general characteristics ofdecorative art, from the Byzantine or early Christian period to thedecline of that termed the _Renaissance_. This beautiful work--forbeautiful it is--is extremely well timed, as it appears at a moment whenour manufacturers who desire to display their skill at the greatexhibition of 1851, must be most anxious to see "the principles by whichour ancestors controlled their genius in producing articles of taste andbeauty, from the precious metals, from enamels, from glass, fromembroidery, and from the various other textures and materials onwhich they delighted to lavish their skill and ingenuity (both for thevarious services of the Church, and also as accessories to the luxuriesof the wealthy of all classes)." The present number contains: 1. "Anexquisite Cup, designed by Holbein for Queen Jane Seymour;" 2. "StainedGlass of the 13th Century, from the Cathedral of Chartres;" 3. "Anexquisite Specimen of Embroidery (of the date of 1554), from a pictureof Queen Mary belonging to the Society of Antiquaries;" and, 4."Iron-work from the Tomb of Eleanor of Castile." It will be seen, fromthis enumeration of them, how varied and well selected are the subjectsof this new work of Mr. Shaw, and how well they are adapted to answerthe end which he has in view.Messrs. Leigh Sotheby & Co. will sell on Thursday next, and the twofollowing days, "The valuable and select library of William Ashby Ashby,Esq., of Queenby Hall, Leicestershire," consisting of standard works inEnglish history, and the best editions of Latin, Italian, and FrenchClassics, &c. all in the choicest old morroco, russia, and otherhandsome bindings.We have received the following Catalogues:--"Number I., for 1850, of John Miller's Catalogue of Books, Old and New,on Sale at 43.

There is a strength, and a     warmth, and a life, in his mention of the great truths of the     Gospel, which show that he spoke from the heart, and that, like the     Apostle of old, he could say.--'I believe, and therefore have I     spoken.'"--_Theologian_.     "Plain, short, and affectionate discourse."--_English Review_.2 Vols. 12mo., 8s. each, sold separately. SERMONS. By ALFRED GATTY M.A.,Vicar of Ecclesfield.     "We say willingly of these Sermons, what we can seldom say of     sermons published at the request of parishioners, that they justify     the respect paid to them; and appear to us in somewhat the same     light as we should suppose they seemed to those who listened to and     admired them. They are sermons of a high and solid character, and     are the production of a good Churchman. They are earnest and     affectionate, and follow out of the Church's     doctrine."--_Theologian_.     "Warm-hearted and thoughtful."--_Guardian_.     "When the first edition of theses Sermons appeared, we noticed them     as a series of plain and practical, but close and scholarly     discourses. The appearance of a second edition, in a short time,     justifies our recommendation."--_Spectator_.     "In the effective simplicity with which Mr. Gatty applies the     incidents and precepts of the Gospel to the every-day concerns of     life he has no superior."--_Britannia_.8vo., price 7s. 6d. THE UNITY OF GOD'S MORAL LAW, AS REVEALED IN THE OLDAND NEW TESTAMENT. By the Rev. A.J. MACLEANE, M.A., Trinity College,Cambridge, Principal of Brighton College.     "We can recommend it not only as an answer to charges and     insinuations, but also as an able and clear exposition of the     meeting point of the Jewish and Christian dispensations; a distinct     and lucid delineation, amidst apparent divergencies, of the     coincidences of the animating principles of the law and the     gospel."--_Christian Observer_.8vo., cloth, 8s.

"This volume of sermons is of a different stamp from the generality     of those which come under our notice. There is a vigour of thought     and language throughout, without the slightest extravagance or     exaggeration. There is no far-fetched strain of reasoning, nor any     attempt at fine writing in these discourses; but the mind of the     reader is directed, by a well-managed series of divisions, to the     principal doctrines and duties derivable from the passages under     consideration. These sermons will afford to the young clergyman     excellent examples of the kind of composition which is calculated     to render his pulpit-ministration effectual."--_English Review_.London: GEORGE BELL, 186.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year. For example:     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  Forexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234or filename 24689 would be found at:     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689An alternative method of locating eBooks:     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALLThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, No. 424, NewSeries, February 14, 1852, by VariousThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and withalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1852.  PRICE 1-1/2 _d_.THE PATTERN NATION.It seems to be the destiny of France to work out all sorts of problemsin state and social policy. It may be said to volunteer experiments ingovernment for the benefit of mankind. All kinds of forms it tries,one after the other: each, in turn, is supposed to be the right thing;and when found to be wrong, an effort, fair or unfair, is made to trysomething else. It would surely be the height of ingratitude not tothank our versatile neighbour for this apparently endless series ofexperiments.Unfortunately, the novel projects extemporised by the French are noton all occasions easily laid aside. What they have laid hold on, theycannot get rid of. We have a striking instance of this in the practiceof subdividing lands. Forms of state administration may be altered,and after all not much harm done; it is only changing one variety ofpower at the Tuileries for another. A very different thing is arevolution in the method of holding landed property. Few things aremore dangerous than to meddle with laws of inheritance: if care be nottaken, the whole fabric of society may be overthrown. The unpleasantpredicament which the French have got into on this account is mostalarming--far more terrible than the wildest of their revolutions. Howthey are to get out of it, no man can tell.Latterly, the world has heard much of Socialism. This is the termapplied to certain new and untried schemes of social organisation, bywhich, among other things, it is proposed to supersede the ordinaryrights of property and laws of inheritance--the latter, as isobserved, having, after due experience, failed to realise thathappiness of condition which was anticipated sixty years ago at theirinstitution. As it is always instructive to look back on the firstdeparture from rectitude, let us say a few words as to how the Frenchfell into their present unhappy position.At the Revolution of 1789-93, it will be recollected that the laws ofprimogeniture were overthrown, and it was ordained that in futureevery man's property should be divided equally among his children athis death: there can be no doubt that considerations of justice andhumanity were at the foundation of this new law of inheritance.Hitherto, there had been a great disparity in the condition of highand low: certain properties, descending from eldest son to eldest son,had become enormously large, and were generally ill managed; whileprodigious numbers of people had no property at all, and weredependents on feudal superiors. The country was undoubtedly in a badcondition, and some modification of the law was desirable. Reckless ofconsequences, the system as it stood was utterly swept away, and thatof equal partition took its place. About the same period, vast domainsbelonging to the crown, the clergy, and the nobility, weresequestrated and sold in small parcels; so that there sprang up almostat once a proprietary of quite a new description. Had the law of equalpartition been extended only to cases in which there was notestamentary provision, it could not have inflicted serious damage,and would at all events have been consistent with reason andexpediency: but it went the length of depriving a parent of the rightto distribute his property in the manner he judged best, and handedover every tittle of his earnings in equal shares to his children. Onechild might be worthless, and another the reverse; no matter--all wereto be treated alike. No preference could be shewn, no posthumousreward could be given for general good-conduct or filial respect. Inall this, there was something so revolting to common sense, that onefeels a degree of wonder that so acute a people as the French shouldhave failed to observe the error into which they were plunging.For every law, however bad, there is always some justification or pleaof necessity. Besides tending to level the position of individuals,the plan of equal distribution of property was said to be justifiableon the ground that there are more than two parties concerned. Society,it was alleged, comes in as a third, and says to the parent: 'You mustprovide for this son, however worthless; you must not throw himdestitute on our hands; for that is to shift the responsibility fromyourself, who brought him into the world, to us, who have nothing todo with him.' This plea, more plausible than sound, had its effect.That an occasional wrong might not be inflicted, a great nationalerror, practically injurious, was committed.A compulsory law of equal division of lands among the children of adeceased proprietor, may be long in revealing its horrors in a countrywhere the redundant population sheds habitually off. In Switzerland,for example, the evil of a subdivision of lands is marked but in amoderate degree--though bad enough in the main--because a certainproportion of each generation emigrates in quest of a livelihood--theyoung men going off to be mercenary soldiers in Italy, waiters athotels, and so forth; and the young women to be governesses anddomestic servants. France, on the contrary, is the last nation in theworld to try the subdivision principle. Its people, with some triflingexceptions, go nowhere, as if affecting to despise all the rest of theworld. Contented with moderate fortunes, inclined to make amusementtheir occupation, unwilling or unable to learn foreign languages, orto care for anything abroad, and having so intense a love of France,that they will not emigrate, they necessarily settle down in agradually aggregating mass, and are driven to the very last shifts forexistence. Only two things have saved the nation from anarchy: theremarkable circumstance of few families consisting of more than two,or at most three children, any more being deemed a culpablemonstrosity; and the draughting of young men for the army. In otherwords, the war-demon is an engine to keep the population in check; forif it does not at once kill off men, it occupies them in militaryaffairs at the public expense. The prodigious number of civil postsunder government--said to be upwards of half a million--acts also as ameans for absorbing the overplus rural population.Circumstances of the nature here pointed out have modified the evileffects of the law of subdivision; but after making every allowance onthis and every other score that can be suggested, it is undeniablethat the partition of property has gone down and down, till at length,in some situations, it can go no further. The morsels of land havebecome so small, that they are not worth occupying, and will barelyrealise the expense of legal transfer. In certain quarters, we areinformed, the individual properties are not larger than a singlefurrow, or a patch the size of a cabbage-garden. A good number ofthese landed estates--one authority says a million and a quarter--areabout five acres in extent, which is considered quite a respectableproperty; but as, at the death of each proprietor, there is a furtherpartition, the probability would seem to be that, ultimately, thesurface of France will resemble the worst parts of Ireland, with apopulation sunk to the lowest grade of humanity. Perhaps, however, theevils inflicted on society through the agency of subdivision, aremainly incidental. General injury goes on at a more rapid rate thanthe actual partition of property. From the causes above mentioned, thepopulation in France is long in doubling itself; and the slower theincrease, the slower the subdivision. Already, however, the propertiesare so small, that they do not admit of that profitable cultureenjoined by principles of improved husbandry and correct socialpolicy. In the proper cultivation of the soil, other parties besidesagriculturists are concerned; for whatever limits production, affectsthe national wealth. The meagre husbandry of the small properties inFrance is thus a serious loss to the country, and tends to generalimpoverishment. But there is another and equally calamitousconsequence of excessive subdivision. The small proprietors in Franceare for the greater part owners only in name: practically, they aretenants. Desperate in their circumstances, they have borrowed money ontheir wretched holdings; and so poor is the security, and so limitedis the capital at disposal on loan, that the interest paid on mortgageruns from 8 to 10 per cent.--often is as high as 20 per cent. Afterpaying taxes, interest on loans, and other necessary expenses, such isthe exhaustion of resources, that thousands of these French peasantproprietors may be said to live in a continual battle with famine.According to official returns, there are in France upwards of 348,000dwellings with no other aperture than the door; and nearly 2,000,000with only one window. And to this the 'pattern nation' has broughtitself by its headlong haste to upset, not simply improve, a badinstitution. The living in these windowless and single-windowed abodesis not living, in the proper sense of the word: it is existencewithout comfort, without hope. The next step is to burrow in holeslike rabbits.It will thus be observed, that the subdivision of real estate hasbrought France pretty much back to the point where it started--a smallwealthy class, and a very numerous poor class. The computation is,that in a population of 36,000,000, only 800,000 are in easycircumstances. A considerable proportion of this moneyed class areusurers, living in Paris and other large towns. They are the lendersof cash on bonds, which squeeze out the very vitals of the nation--thegay flutterers and loungers of the streets, theatres, and cafes,drawing the means of luxurious indulgence from the myriads who toilout their lives in the fields.Obtaining a glimpse of these facts, we can no longer wonder at thesubmission of the French peasantry to a thinning of their families bymilitary conscription; at the eager thirst for office which afflictsthe whole nation; or at the morbid desire to overturn society, andstrike out a better organisation. As matters grow worse, this passionfor wholesale change becomes more fervidly manifested. The_jacqueries_ of the middle ages are renewed. Various districts ofcountry, in which poverty has reached its climax, break into universalinsurrection. It is a war levied by those who have nothing againstthose who have something. To have coin in the pocket, is to be theenemy. The cry is: Down with the rich; take all they have got, anddivide the plunder amongst us. Such are the avowed principles of theSocialists. According to them, all property is theft, and taking byviolence is only recovering stolen goods! When a nation has come tothis deplorable pass, what, it may be asked, can cure it? The maladyis not political; it is social. Perhaps, under a right development ofindustry, France has not too great a population; but, subject to thepresent misdirection of its energies, the position of the country isassuming a gravity of aspect which may well engage the most earnestconsideration. The least that could be recommended is an immediatechange in the law which so unscrupulously subdivides and ruins landedproperty.The history of the Revolution of 1789-93, must have made a feebleimpression, if it has failed to print a deep and indelible convictionon the mind, that the acts of that great and wicked drama would someday be bitterly expiated. To expect anything else would be to impeachthe principles of everlasting justice. Bearing in remembrance thehorrid excesses of almost an entire nation, nothing that now occurs inFrance affords us the least surprise. The anarchical revolts of 1851,are only a sequence of crimes committed upwards of half a century ago.Philosophically, the beginning and the end are one thing. Blind withrage against all that was noble, holy, and simply respectable, theinnocent were dragged in crowds to the scaffold, and their propertyconfiscated and disposed of. See the consequence after a lapse ofsixty years, 'My sin hath found me out.' The ill-gotten wealth hasbeen the very instrument to punish and prostrate. A robbery followedby divisions among the spoilers. Waste succeeded by clamorousdestitution. What a lesson!It is needless to say, that Socialism, which proposes a universalre-distribution of property, with some unintelligible organisation oflabour--all on an equality, no rich and no poor, no masters and noservants, everybody sharing his dinner with his neighbour--is a fancyas baseless as any crotchet which even the 'pattern nation' has everconcocted. Yet, it is not the less likely to be carried intoexecution, perhaps only the more likely from its practical absurdity.Of course, the more educated and wealthy portion of the nation viewthe doctrines of Socialism, as far as they can comprehend them, withserious apprehension; but unhappily for France, these classesuniformly submit to any folly or crime, which comes with the emphasisof authority, valid or usurped. At present, they may be said to havemade a compromise, bartering civil liberty for bare safety--permissionto live! But how long this will last, and what form the tenure ofproperty is to assume, are questions not easy to answer. It would notsurprise us to see the nation, in its corporate capacity, assume theposition of universal lender of money on, or proprietor of,embarrassed estates; in which case the 'ryot system' of India will,strangely enough, have found domestication in Europe! Is this to bethe next experiment?A curious and saddening problem is the future of this great country.'France,' said Robespierre in one of his moments of studiedinspiration, 'has astonished all Europe with her prodigies of reason!'We are now witnessing the development of several of these astonishingprodigies; and the spectacle, to say the least of it, is instructive.MY TRAVELLING COMPANION.My picture was a failure. Partial friends had guaranteed its success;but the Hanging Committee and the press are not composed of one'spartial friends. The Hanging Committee thrust me into thedarkest corner of the octagon-room, and the press ignored myexistence--excepting in one instance, when my critic dismissed me in aquarter of a line as a 'presumptuous dauber.' I was stunned with theblow, for I had counted so securely on the L.200 at which my grandhistorical painting was dog-cheap--not to speak of the deathless famewhich it was to create for me--that I felt like a mere wreck when myhopes were flung to the ground, and the untasted cup dashed from mylips. I took to my bed, and was seriously ill. The doctor bled me tillI fainted, and then said, that he had saved me from a brain-fever.That might be, but he very nearly threw me into a consumption, onlythat I had a deep chest and a good digestion. Pneumonic expansion andactive chyle saved me from an early tomb, yet I was too unhappy to begrateful.But why did my picture fail? Surely it possessed all the elements ofsuccess! It was grandly historical in subject, original in treatment,pure in colouring; what, then, was wanting? This old warrior's head,of true Saxon type, had all the majesty of Michael Angelo; that youngfigure, all the radiant grace of Correggio; no Rembrandt shewed moresevere dignity than yon burnt umber monk in the corner; and Titiannever excelled the loveliness of this cobalt virgin in the foreground.Why did it not succeed? The subject, too--the 'Finding of the Body ofHarold by Torch-light'--was sacred to all English hearts; and beingconceived in an entirely new and original manner, it was redeemed fromthe charge of triteness and wearisomeness. The composition waspyramidal, the apex being a torch borne aloft for the 'high light,'and the base shewing some very novel effects of herbage and armour.But it failed. All my skill, all my hope, my ceaseless endeavour, myburning visions, all--all had failed; and I was only a poor,half-starved painter, in Great Howland Street, whose landlady wasdaily abating in her respect, and the butcher daily abating in hispunctuality; whose garments were getting threadbare, and his dinnershypothetical, and whose day-dreams of fame and fortune had faded intothe dull-gray of penury and disappointment. I was broken-hearted, ill,hungry; so I accepted an invitation from a friend, a rich manufacturerin Birmingham, to go down to his house for the Christmas holidays. Hehad a pleasant place in the midst of some ironworks, the blazingchimneys of which, he assured me, would afford me some exquisitestudies of 'light' effects.By mistake, I went by the Express train, and so was thrown into thesociety of a lady whose position would have rendered any acquaintancewith her impossible, excepting under such chance-conditions as thepresent; and whose history, as I learned it afterwards, led me toreflect much on the difference between the reality and the seeming oflife.She moved my envy. Yes--base, mean, low, unartistic, degrading as isthis passion, I felt it rise up like a snake in my breast when I sawthat feeble woman. She was splendidly dressed--wrapped in furs of themost costly kind, trailing behind; her velvets and lace worth acountess's dowry. She was attended by obsequious menials; surroundedby luxuries; her compartment of the carriage was a perfect palace inall the accessories which it was possible to collect in so small aspace; and it seemed as though 'Cleopatra's cup' would have been noimpracticable draught for her. She gave me more fully the impressionof luxury, than any person I had ever met with before; and I thought Ihad reason when I envied her.She was lifted into the carriage carefully; carefully swathed in hersplendid furs and lustrous velvets; and placed gently, like a woundedbird, in her warm nest of down. But she moved languidly, and fretfullythrust aside her servants' busy hands, indifferent to her comforts,and annoyed by her very blessings. I looked into her face: it was astrange face, which had once been beautiful; but ill-health, and care,and grief, had marked it now with deep lines, and coloured it withunnatural tints. Tears had washed out the roses from her cheeks, andset large purple rings about her eyes; the mouth was hard and pinched,but the eyelids swollen; while the crossed wrinkles on her brow toldthe same tale of grief grown petulant, and of pain grown soured, asthe thin lip, quivering and querulous, and the nervous hand, neverstill and never strong.The train-bell rang, the whistle sounded, the lady's servitors stoodbareheaded and courtesying to the ground, and the rapid rush of theiron giant bore off the high-born dame and the starveling painter instrange companionship. Unquiet and unresting--now shifting herplace--now letting down the glass for the cold air to blow full uponher withered face--then drawing it up, and chafing her hands and feetby the warm-water apparatus concealed in her _chauffe-pied_,while shivering as if in an ague-fit--sighing deeply--lost inthought--wildly looking out and around for distraction--she soon mademe ask myself whether my envy of her was as true as deep sympathy andpity would have been.'But her wealth--her wealth!' I thought. 'True she may suffer, but howgloriously she is solaced! She may weep, but the angels of social lifewipe off her tears with perfumed linen, gold embroidered; she maygrieve, but her grief makes her joys so much the more blissful. Ah!she is to be envied after all!--envied, while I, a very beggar, mightwell scorn my place now!'Something of this might have been in my face, as I offered my sickcompanion some small attention--I forget what--gathering up one of herluxurious trifles, or arranging her cushions. She seemed almost toread my thoughts as her eyes rested on my melancholy face; and sayingabruptly: 'I fear you are unhappy, young man?' she settled herself inher place like a person prepared to listen to a pleasant tale.'I am unfortunate, madam,' I answered.'Unfortunate?' she said impatiently. 'What! with youth and health, canyou call yourself unfortunate? When the whole world lies untriedbefore you, and you still live in the golden atmosphere of hope, canyou pamper yourself with sentimental sorrows? Fie upon you!--fie uponyou! What are your sorrows compared with mine?''I am ignorant of yours, madam,' I said respectfully; 'but I know myown; and, knowing them, I can speak of their weight and bitterness. Byyour very position, you cannot undergo the same kind of distress asthat overwhelming me at this moment: you may have evils in your pathof life, but they cannot equal mine.''Can anything equal the evils of ruined health and a desolatedhearth?' she cried, still in the same impatient manner. 'Can the worstgriefs of wayward youth equal the bitterness of that cup which youdrink at such a time of life as forbids all hope of after-assuagement?Can the first disappointment of a strong heart rank with the terribledesolation of a wrecked old age? You think because you see about methe evidences of wealth, that I must be happy. Young man, I tell youtruly, I would gladly give up every farthing of my princely fortune,and be reduced to the extreme of want, to bring back from the gravethe dear ones lying there, or pour into my veins one drop of thebounding blood of health and energy which used to make life a longplay-hour of delight. Once, no child in the fields, no bird in thesky, was more blessed than I; and what am I now?--a sickly, lonely oldwoman, whose nerves are shattered and whose heart is broken, withouthope or happiness on the earth! Even death has passed me by inforgetfulness and scorn!'Her voice betrayed the truth of her emotion. Still, with an accent ofbitterness and complaint, rather than of simple sorrow, it was thevoice of one fighting against her fate, more than of one sufferingacutely and in despair: it was petulant rather than melancholy; angryrather than grieving; shewing that her trials had hardened, notsoftened her heart.'Listen to me,' she then said, laying her hand on my arm, 'and perhapsmy history may reconcile you to the childish depression, from whatcause soever it may be, under which you are labouring. You are youngand strong, and can bear any amount of pain as yet: wait until youreach my age, and then you will know the true meaning of the worddespair! I am rich, as you may see,' she continued, pointing to hersurroundings--'in truth, so rich that I take no account either of myincome or my expenditure. I have never known life under any otherform; I have never known what it was to be denied the gratification ofone desire which wealth could purchase, or obliged to calculate thecost of a single undertaking. I can scarcely realise the idea ofpoverty. I see that all people do not live in the same style asmyself, but I cannot understand that it is from inability: it alwaysseems to me to be from their own disinclination. I tell you, I cannotfully realise the idea of poverty; and you think this must make mehappy, perhaps?' she added sharply, looking full in my face.'I should be happy, madam, if I were rich,' I replied. 'Suffering nowfrom the strain of poverty, it is no marvel if I place an undue valueon plenty.''Yet see what it does for me!' continued my companion. 'Does it giveme back my husband, my brave boys, my beautiful girl? Does it giverest to this weary heart, or relief to this aching head? Does itsoothe my mind or heal my body? No! It but oppresses me, like a heavyrobe thrown round weakened limbs: it is even an additional misfortune,for if I were poor, I should be obliged to think of other thingsbeside myself and my woes; sand the very mental exertion necessary tosustain my position would lighten my miseries. I have seen my daughterwasting year by year and day by day, under the warm sky of thesouth--under the warm care of love! Neither climate nor affectioncould save her: every effort was made--the best advice procured--thelatest panacea adopted; but to no effect. Her life was prolonged,certainly; but this simply means, that she was three years in dying,instead of three months. She was a gloriously lovely creature, like afair young saint for beauty and purity--quite an ideal thing, with hergolden hair and large blue eyes! She was my only girl--my youngest, mydarling, my best treasure! My first real sorrow--now fifteen yearsago--was when I saw her laid, on her twenty-first birthday, in theEnglish burial-ground at Madeira. It is on the gravestone, that shedied of consumption: would that it had been added--and her mother ofgrief! From the day of her death, my happiness left me!'Here the poor lady paused, and buried her face in her hands. The firstsorrow was evidently also the keenest; and I felt my own eyelids moistas I watched this outpouring of the mother's anguish. After all, herewas grief beyond the power of wealth to assuage: here was sorrowdeeper than any mere worldly disappointment.'I had two sons,' she went on to say after a short time--'only two.They were fine young men, gifted and handsome. In fact, all mychildren were allowed to be very models of beauty. One entered thearmy, the other the navy. The eldest went with his regiment to theCape, where he married a woman of low family--an infamous creature ofno blood; though she was decently conducted for a low-born thing asshe was. She was well-spoken of by those who knew her; but what_could_ she be with a butcher for a grandfather! However, my poorinfatuated son loved her to the last. She was very pretty, I haveheard--young, and timid; but being of such fearfully low origin, ofcourse she could not be recognised by my husband or myself! We forbademy son all intercourse with us, unless he would separate himself fromher; but the poor boy was perfectly mad, and he preferred thislow-born wife to his father and mother. They had a little baby, whowas sent over to me when the wife died--for, thank God! she did die ina few years' time. My son was restored to our love, and he receivedour forgiveness; but we never saw him again. He took a fever of thecountry, and was a corpse in a few hours. My second boy was in thenavy--a fine high-spirited fellow, who seemed to set all the accidentsof life at defiance. I could not believe in any harm coming to _him_.He was so strong, so healthy, so beautiful, so bright: he might havebeen immortal, for all the elements of decay that shewed themselves inhim. Yet this glorious young hero was drowned--wrecked off acoral-reef, and flung like a weed on the waters. He lost his own lifein trying to save that of a common sailor--a piece of pure goldbartered for the foulest clay! Two years after this, my husband diedof typhus fever, and I had a nervous attack, from which I have neverrecovered. And now, what do you say to this history of mine? Forfifteen years, I have never been free from sorrow. No sooner did onegrow so familiar to me, that I ceased to tremble at its hideousness,than another, still more terrible, came to overwhelm me in freshmisery. For fifteen years, my heart has never known an hour's peace;and to the end of my life, I shall be a desolate, miserable,broken-hearted woman. Can you understand, now, the valuelessness of myriches, and how desolate my splendid house must seem to me? They havebeen given me for no useful purpose here or hereafter; they encumberme, and do no good to others. Who is to have them when I die?Hospitals and schools? I hate the medical profession, and I am againstthe education of the poor. I think it the great evil of the day, and Iwould not leave a penny of mine to such a radical wrong. What is tobecome of my wealth?'--'Your grandson,' I interrupted hastily: 'the child of the officer.'The old woman's face gradually softened. 'Ah! he is a lovely boy,' shesaid; 'but I don't love him--no, I don't,' she repeated vehemently.'If I set my heart on him, he will die or turn out ill: take to thelow ways of his wretched mother, or die some horrible death. I steelmy heart against him, and shut him out from my calculations of thefuture. He is a sweet boy: interesting, affectionate, lovely; but Iwill not allow myself to love him, and I don't allow him to love me!But you ought to see him. His hair is like my own daughter's--long,glossy, golden hair; and his eyes are large and blue, and the lashescurl on his cheek like heavy fringes. He is too pale and too thin: helooks sadly delicate; but his wretched mother was a delicate littlecreature, and he has doubtless inherited a world of disease and poorblood from her. I wish he was here though, for you to see; but I keephim at school, for when he is much with me, I feel myself beginning tobe interested in him; and I do not wish to love him--I do not wish toremember him at all! With that delicate frame and nervous temperament,he _must_ die; and why should I prepare fresh sorrow for myself, bytaking him into my heart, only to have him plucked out again bydeath?'All this was said with the most passionate vehemence of manner, as ifshe were defending herself against some unjust charge. I saidsomething in the way of remonstrance. Gently and respectfully, butfirmly, I spoke of the necessity for each soul to spiritualise itsaspirations, and to raise itself from the trammels of earth; and inspeaking thus to her, I felt my own burden lighten off my heart, and Iacknowledged that I had been both foolish and sinful in allowing myfirst disappointment to shadow all the sunlight of my existence. I amnot naturally of a desponding disposition, and nothing but a blow assevere as the non-success of my 'Finding the Body of Harold byTorch-light' could have affected me to the extent of mentalprostration as that under which I was now labouring. But this was veryhard to bear! My companion listened to me with a kind of blanksurprise, evidently unaccustomed to the honesty of truth; but she boremy remarks patiently, and when I had ended, she even thanked me for myadvice.'And now, tell me the cause of your melancholy face?' she asked, as wewere nearing Birmingham. 'Your story cannot be very long, and I shallhave just enough time to hear it.'I smiled at her authoritative tone, and said quietly: 'I am an artist,madam, and I had counted much on the success of my first historicalpainting. It has failed, and I am both penniless and infamous. I amthe "presumptuous dauber" of the critics--despised by mycreditors--emphatically a failure throughout.''Pshaw!' cried the lady impatiently; 'and what is that for a grief? aday's disappointment which a day's labour can repair! To me, yourtroubles seem of no more worth than a child's tears when he has brokenhis newest toy! Here is Birmingham, and I must bid you farewell.Perhaps you will open the door for me? Good-morning: you have made myjourney pleasant, and relieved my ennui. I shall be happy to see youin town, and to help you forward in your career.'And with these words, said in a strange, indifferent, matter-of-facttone, as of one accustomed to all the polite offers of good society,which mean nothing tangible, she was lifted from the carriage by atrain of servants, and borne off the platform.I looked at the card which she placed in my hand, and read the addressof 'Mrs Arden, Belgrave Square.'I found my friend waiting for me; and in a few moments was seatedbefore a blazing fire in a magnificent drawing-room, surrounded withevery comfort that hospitality could offer or luxury invent.'Here, at least, is happiness,' I thought, as I saw the familyassemble in the drawing-room before dinner. 'Here are beauty, youth,wealth, position--all that makes life valuable. What concealedskeleton can there be in this house to frighten away one grace ofexistence? None--none! They must be happy; and oh! what a contrast tothat poor lady I met with to-day; and what a painful contrast tomyself!'And all my former melancholy returned like a heavy cloud upon my brow;and I felt that I stood like some sad ghost in a fairy-land of beauty,so utterly out of place was my gloom in the midst of all this gaietyand splendour.One daughter attracted my attention more than the rest. She was theeldest, a beautiful girl of about twenty-three, or she might have beeneven a few years older. Her face was quite of the Spanish style--dark,expressive, and tender; and her manners were the softest and mostbewitching I had ever seen. She was peculiarly attractive to anartist, from the exceeding beauty of feature, as well as from thedepth of expression which distinguished her. I secretly sketched herportrait on my thumb-nail, and in my own mind I determined to make herthe model for my next grand attempt at historical composition--'theReturn of Columbus.' She was to be the Spanish queen; and I thought ofmyself as Ferdinand; for I was not unlike a Spaniard in appearance,and I was almost as brown.I remained with my friend a fortnight, studying the midnight effectsof the iron-foundries, and cultivating the acquaintance of Julia. Inthese two congenial occupations the time passed like lightning, and Iwoke as from a pleasant dream, to the knowledge of the fact, that myvisit was expected to be brought to a close. I had been asked, Iremembered, for a week, and I had doubled my furlough. I hinted atbreakfast, that I was afraid I must leave my kind friends to-morrow,and a general regret was expressed, but no one asked me to staylonger; so the die was unhappily cast.Julia was melancholy. I could not but observe it; and I confess thatthe observation caused me more pleasure than pain. Could it be sorrowat my departure? We had been daily, almost hourly, companions forfourteen days, and the surmise was not unreasonable. She had alwaysshewn me particular kindness, and she could not but have seen mymarked preference for her. My heart beat wildly as I gazed on her palecheek and drooping eyelid; for though she had been always still andgentle, I had never seen--certainly I had never noticed--such evidenttraces of sorrow, as I saw in her face to-day. Oh, if it were for me,how I would bless each pang which pained that beautiful heart!--how Iwould cherish the tears that fell, as if they had been pricelessdiamonds from the mine!--how I would joy in her grief and live in herdespair! It might be that out of evil would come good, and from thedeep desolation of my unsold 'Body' might arise the heavenlyblessedness of such love as this! I was intoxicated with my hopes; andwas on the point of making a public idiot of myself, but happily someslight remnant of common-sense was left me. However, impatient tolearn my fate, I drew Julia aside; and, placing myself at her feet,while she was enthroned on a luxurious ottoman, I pretended that Imust conclude the series of lectures on art, and the best methods ofcolouring, on which I had been employed with her ever since my visit.'You seem unhappy to-day, Miss Reay,' I said abruptly, with my voicetrembling like a girl's.She raised her large eyes languidly. 'Unhappy? no, I am neverunhappy,' she said quietly.Her voice never sounded so silvery sweet, so pure and harmonious. Itfell like music on the air.'I have, then, been too much blinded by excess of beauty to have beenable to see correctly,' I answered. 'To me you have appeared alwayscalm, but never sad; but to-day there is a palpable weight of sorrowon you, which a child might read. It is in your voice, and on youreyelids, and round your lips; it is on you like the moss on the youngrose--beautifying while veiling the dazzling glory within.''Ah! you speak far too poetically for me,' said Julia, smiling. 'Ifyou will come down to my level for a little while, and will talk to merationally, I will tell you my history. I will tell it you as a lessonfor yourself, which I think will do you good.'The cold chill that went to my soul! Her history! It was no diary offacts that I wanted to hear, but only a register of feelings--aregister of feelings in which I should find myself the only pointwhereto the index was set. History! what events deserving that namecould have troubled the smooth waters of her life?I was silent, for I was disturbed; but Julia did not notice either myembarrassment or my silence, and began, in her low, soft voice, toopen one of the saddest chapters of life which I had ever heard.'You do not know that I am going into a convent?' she said; then,without waiting for an answer, she continued: 'This is the last monthof my worldly life. In four weeks, I shall have put on the white robeof the novitiate, and in due course I trust to be dead for ever tothis earthly life.'A heavy, thick, choking sensation in my throat, and a burning painwithin my eyeballs, warned me to keep silence. My voice would havebetrayed me.'When I was seventeen,' continued Julia, 'I was engaged to my cousin.We had been brought up together from childhood, and we loved eachother perfectly. You must not think, because I speak so calmly now,that I have not suffered in the past. It is only by the grace ofresignation and of religion, that I have been brought to my presentcondition of spiritual peace. I am now five-and-twenty--next week Ishall be six-and-twenty: that is just nine years since I was firstengaged to Laurence. He was not rich enough, and indeed he was far tooyoung, to marry, for he was only a year older than myself; and if hehad had the largest possible amount of income, we could certainly nothave married for three years. My father never cordially approved ofthe engagement, though he did not oppose it. Laurence was takenpartner into a large concern here, and a heavy weight of business wasimmediately laid on him. Youthful as he was, he was made the sole andalmost irresponsible agent in a house which counted its capital bymillions, and through which gold flowed like water. For some time, hewent on well--to a marvel well. He was punctual, vigilant, careful;but the responsibility was too much for the poor boy: the praises hereceived, the flattery and obsequiousness which, for the first time,were lavished on the friendless youth, the wealth at his command, allturned his head. For a long time, we heard vague rumours of irregularconduct; but as he was always the same good, affectionate, respectful,happy Laurence when with us, even my father, who is so strict, andsomewhat suspicious, turned a deaf ear to them. I was the earliest tonotice a slight change, first in his face, and then in his manners. Atlast the rumours ceased to be vague, and became definite. Businessneglected; fatal habits visible even in the early day; the frightfuluse of horrible words which once he would have trembled to use; thenights passed at the gaming-table, and the days spent in the societyof the worst men on the turf--all these accusations were brought to myfather by credible witnesses; and, alas! they were too true to berefuted. My father--Heaven and the holy saints bless his grayhead!--kept them from me as long as he could. He forgave him again andagain, and used every means that love and reason could employ to bringhim back into the way of right; but he could do nothing against theforce of such fatal habits as those to which my poor Laurence had nowbecome wedded. With every good intention, and with much strong lovefor me burning sadly amid the wreck of his virtues, he yet would notrefrain: the Evil One had overcome him; he was his prey here andhereafter. O no--not hereafter!' she added, raising her hands and eyesto heaven, 'if prayer, if fasting, patient vigil, incessant striving,may procure him pardon--not for ever his prey! Our engagement wasbroken off; and this step, necessary as it was, completed his ruin. Hedied'--Here a strong shudder shook her from head to foot, and I halfrose, in alarm. The next instant she was calm.'Now, you know my history,' continued she. 'It is a tragedy of reallife, which you will do well, young painter, to compare with yourown!' With a kindly pressure of the hand, and a gentle smile--oh! sosweet, so pure, and heavenly!--Julia Reay left me; while I satperfectly awed--that is the only word I can use--with the revelationwhich she had made both of her history and of her own grand soul.'Come with me to my study,' said Mr Reay, entering the room; 'I have aworld to talk to you about. You go to-morrow, you say. I am sorry forit; but I must therefore settle my business with you in good timeto-day.'I followed him mechanically, for I was undergoing a mental castigationwhich rather disturbed me. Indeed, like a young fool--as eager inself-reproach as in self-glorification--I was so occupied in inwardlycalling myself hard names, that even when my host gave me a commissionfor my new picture, 'The Return of Columbus,' at two hundred and fiftypounds, together with an order to paint himself, Mrs Reay, andhalf-a-dozen of their children, I confess it with shame, that Ireceived the news like a leaden block, and felt neither surprise norjoy--not though these few words chased me from the gates of the Fleet,whither I was fast hastening, and secured me both position and dailybread. The words of that beautiful girl were still ringing in my ears,mixed up with the bitterest self-accusations; and these together shutout all other sound, however pleasant. But that was always my way.I went back to London, humbled and yet strengthened, having learnedmore of human nature and the value of events, in one short fortnight,than I had ever dreamed of before. The first lessons of youthgenerally come in hard shape. I had sense enough to feel that I hadlearned mine gently, and that I had cause to be thankful for themildness of the teaching. From a boy, I became a man, judging moreaccurately of humanity than a year's ordinary experience would haveenabled me to do. And the moral which I drew was this: that under ourmost terrible afflictions, we may always gain some spiritual good, ifwe suffer them to be softening and purifying rather than hardeninginfluences over us. And also, that while we are suffering the mostacutely, we may be sure that others are suffering still more acutely;and if we would but sympathise with them more than withourselves--live out of our ownselves, and in the wide world aroundus--we would soon be healed while striving to heal others. Of this Iam convinced: the secret of life, and of all its good, is in love; andwhile we preserve this, we can never fail of comfort. The sweet waterswill always gush out over the sandiest desert of our lives while wecan love; but without it--nay, not the merest weed of comfort or ofvirtue would grow under the feet of angels. In this was thedistinction between Mrs Arden and Julia Reay. The one had hardened herheart under her trials, and shut it up in itself; the other had openedhers to the purest love of man and love of God; and the result was tobe seen in the despair of the one and in the holy peace of the other.Full of these thoughts, I sought out my poor lady, determined to doher real benefit if I could. She received me very kindly, for I hadtaken care to provide myself with a sufficient introduction, so as toset all doubts of my social position at rest: and I knew how far thiswould go with her. We soon became fast friends. She seemed to rest onme much for sympathy and comfort, and soon grew to regard me with asort of motherly fondness that of itself brightened her life. I paidher all the attention which a devoted son might pay--humoured herwhims, soothed her pains; but insensibly I led her mind out fromitself--first in kindness to me, and then in love to her grandson.I asked for him just before the midsummer holidays, and with greatdifficulty obtained an invitation for him to spend them with her. Sheresisted my entreaties stoutly, but at last was obliged to yield; notto me, nor to my powers of persuasion, but to the holy truth of whichI was then the advocate. The child came, and I was there also toreceive him, and to enforce by my presence--which I saw without vanityhad great influence--a fitting reception. He was a pensive, clever,interesting little fellow; sensitive and affectionate, timid, giftedwith wonderful powers, and of great beauty. There was a shy look inhis eyes, which made me sure that he inherited much of his lovelinessfrom his mother; and when we were great friends, he shewed me a smallportrait of 'poor mamma;' and I saw at once the most striking likenessbetween the two. No human heart could withstand that boy, certainlynot my poor friend's. She yielded, fighting desperately against me andhim, and all the powers of love, which were subduing her, but yieldingwhile she fought; and in a short time the child had taken his properplace in her affections, which he kept to the end of her life. Andshe, that desolate mother, even she, with her seared soul andpetrified heart, was brought to the knowledge of peace by the gloriouspower of love.Prosperous, famous, happy, blessed in home and hearth, this has becomemy fundamental creed of life, the basis on which all good, whether ofart or of morality, is rested: of art especially; for only by atender, reverent spirit can the true meaning of his vocation be madeknown to the artist. All the rest is mere imitation of form, notinsight into essence. And while I feel that I can live out of myself,and love others--the whole world of man--more than myself, I know thatI possess the secret of happiness; ay, though my powers were suddenlyblasted as by lightning, my wife and children laid in the cold grave,and my happy home desolated for ever. For I would go out into thethronged streets, and gather up the sorrows of others, to relievethem; and I would go out under the quiet sky, and look up to theFather's throne; and I would pluck peace, as green herbs from activebenevolence and contemplative adoration. Yes; love can save from thesterility of selfishness, and from the death of despair: but lovealone. No other talisman has the power; pride, self-sustainment,coldness, pleasure, nothing--nothing--but that divine word of Lifewhich is life's soul!POPULAR MUSIC--MAINZER.In our days, vocal music is beginning to assert in this country theplace it has long held abroad as a great moral educator; no longerregarded as a superfluity of the rich, it is now established as abranch of instruction in almost every school, and is gradually findingits way into many nooks and corners, where it will act as an antidoteto grosser pleasures, by supplying the means of an innocent andelevating recreation.The apostle of music, considered as a boon and privilege of 'themillion,' has lately passed away from the scene of his active labours;and it is but a tribute due to his memory as a philanthropist and manof genius, while we deplore his loss, to pause for a moment andbriefly trace his career.Joseph Mainzer was born, on the 21st October 1801, at Treves, ofparents in the middle rank of life. When quite a child, thepredominating taste of his life was so strongly developed, that inspite of harsh masters he learned to play on the piano, violin,bassoon, and several wind-instruments; and at the age of twelve couldread at sight the most difficult music, and even attemptedcomposition. Music, however, was not intended to be his profession,and was only carried on as a relaxation from the severer studies towhich Mainzer devoted himself at the university of Treves, where hetook the highest degree in general merit, and the first prize fornatural science. At the age of twenty-one, he left college to descendinto the heart of the Saarbruck Mountains as an engineer of mines,where, according to custom, he had to commence with the lowest gradeof labour, and for months drag a heavy wheel-barrow, and wield thepickaxe. Yet here, in reality, dawned his mission as the apostle ofpopular music: he relieved the tedium of those interminable nights oftoil--for days there were none--by composing and teaching choruses,thus leading the miners both in labour and in song. This undergroundlife, however, was too severe for his constitution; and he was obligedto return home in impaired health. He now studied divinity and music;and, after a time, was advised to travel in order to perfect himselfin the latter branch of art. Under Rinck at Darmstadt, and at Viennaand Rome, he enjoyed every advantage; and, on leaving the EternalCity, was invited to a farewell _fete_ by Thorwaldsen, where all theeminent artists of the day were present, and joined in singing hiscompositions. On returning home, after two years' absence, he adoptedmusic as his vocation, and published his first elementary work--the_Singschule_, which was introduced in Prussia and Germany as the_methode_ in schools; and soon after, the king of Prussia sent him thegold medal awarded to men eminent in the arts and sciences. Paris,however, soon offered more attractions to Mainzer than his nativeplace, and thither he repaired and pitched his tent for ten years.During this period, he established his reputation as a composer ofdramatic, sacred, and domestic music, and as an acute and elegantwriter and critic. His opera of _La Jacquerie_ had a run of seventeennights consecutively at the theatre. He was soon welcomed into theliterary and artistic circles of Paris; and one evening, at an elegant_reunion_, being invited to play, he _improvised_ a piece, which wastaken for a composition of Palestrina's. Many were moved to tears, onepair of pre-eminently bright eyes especially; and the consequence was,that the composer and the bright eyes were soon after united inmarriage!But amid these captivating _salons_ and congenial occupations, whathad become of the apostle of popular music? He was not asleep; onlydigesting and preparing a system which should, by its simplicity andclearness, bring scientific music within the reach of the humblest aswell as the highest classes of society. At last it was matured, andthe working-classes were invited to come and test it--gratuitously ofcourse. A few accepted the invitation; but their success and delightin the new art thus opened up to them, was so great, that the 'two orthree' pioneers soon swelled into an army of 3000 _ouvriers_! But aband of 3000 workmen in Paris was considered dangerous: it could notbe credited that they met merely for social improvement andrelaxation; some political design must surely lurk under it:government was alarmed, the police threatened; and it was left toMainzer's choice either to remain in Paris without his artisanclasses, or to seek elsewhere a field for his popular labours. Hedecided at once on the latter alternative, and departed for England,amidst the heartfelt regrets of those whom he had attached so stronglyto himself, while he inculcated peace, order, and every social virtue.On his revisiting Paris long after, his old pupils serenaded himunmolested; and in 1849, the Institute of France voluntarily placedhis name on their list for the membership vacant by the death ofDonizetti; yet he would not accept the proposal of a later Frenchgovernment to return and establish his system: he preferred thefreedom of action which he enjoyed in Britain.In London, a period of arduous labour commenced. Mainzer arrivedwithout patronage, without the _prestige_ that his name had earnedabroad, and, what was a greater drawback, without any knowledge ofEnglish! But, nothing daunted, with his usual energy he set about thetask of acquiring the language, which he did in an incredibly shorttime--commencing, like a child, by naming all familiar objects, andgoing on, until, without perplexing himself with rules or theirexceptions, he had acquired facility enough to lecture in public. Hiswork on _Music and Education_ shows with what force and purity ofstyle he could afterwards write in English. It was the sameprinciple--that of commencing with practice and letting theoryfollow--which he carried out in his system of 'Singing for theMillion.' He argued, that as children learn to speak before they canread or construct language grammatically, so they ought to be taughtvocal music in such a way as to introduce the rules of harmonygradually, and prepare them for the manipulation of an instrument, ifit is intended they should learn one; while for the great masses ofboth children and adults, _the voice_ is the best and only instrument,and one that can be trained, with _very few exceptions_, to take partin choral, if not in solo singing, and at the same time be made apowerful and pleasing agent in moral culture. On this subject, weshall quote Dr Mainzer's own words, when speaking of the compositionsintroduced into his classes, he says: 'Besides religious compositions,there are others, which refer to the Creator, by calling attention tothe beauty and grandeur of his works. Songs, shewing in a few touchinglines the wondrous instinct of the sparrow, the ant, the bee, andcultivating a feeling of respect for all nature's children. Besidesthese, there are songs intended to promote social and domesticvirtues--order, cleanliness, humility, contentment, unity, temperance,etc.; thus impressing, not the letter of the law of charity onimmature minds, but the spirit of it in the memory, and so identifyingthem with the very fibres of the heart.'With such views and principles, Mainzer arrived in England, topropagate his humanising art; and London soon became the centre of aseries of lectures and classes, held in the principal towns accessibleby railway--such as Brighton, Oxford, Reading, etc. But this dividedwork was not satisfactory, and the national schools and popular fieldin London were preoccupied by Hullah, who had some time previouslyintroduced Wilhem's system, under the sanction of government. Therewas room and to spare, however, for every system, and Mainzer wishedevery man good-speed who advanced the cause; but as a fresh field forhis own exertions, after two years spent in England, he turned histhoughts towards Edinburgh, where he had been invited by requisition,and warmly received in 1842.On his return to Scotland, he found his cause somewhat damaged in hisabsence, by the attempt of precentors to teach his system incongregational classes. Unlike the church-organists of England, theScotch precentors are not educated musicians--a naturally good voiceand ear is their only pre-requisite. Dr Mainzer soon repaired thismistake in those congregations which invited his personalsuperintendence; and in one church (Free St Andrew's) the good effectsof his system are still to be heard, in a congregation forming theirown choir, and singing in _four parts_.To restore this country to the standard of musical eminence which weknow from old authorities that it held in the sixteenth century, wasthe object of Dr Mainzer's energetic endeavours. The elements, hebelieved, were not wanting. In Scotland, the musical capacity of thepeople he found to be above rather than below the average of othernations: all that was wanting was to convince the people of this bythe cultivation of their neglected powers. As a preliminary step, heexcited those friendly to the object to found the 'Association for theRevival of Sacred Music in Scotland,' of which he was the director andmoving spring; and under its auspices he commenced a course of_gratuitous_ teaching to classes formed of pupils from the parish anddistrict schools of Edinburgh, precentors, teachers, and operatives.The success of these normal classes was so great and so rapid, that atthe end of the first year the pupils were able to become teachers intheir turn in their own schools or homes; and at the close of thesecond and third sessions, concerts and rural fetes were held, atwhich many hundreds of young voices joined in giving true and powerfulexpression to such works of the great masters as _Judas Maccabaeus_;while for the delight of their parents' firesides, and their own moralimprovement, the children carried home with them those simple buttouching and expressive melodies, composed by Mainzer for their use.At the same time, Mr Mainzer carried on classes for the upper ranks,especially for young children; gave lectures on the history of musicfrom the earliest times and in all countries; and published a talentedwork on _Music and Education_, of which very favourable reviewsappeared at the time.[1] Mainzer had a peculiar predilection forScotland: its scenery, its history, its music, all supplied food forhis various tastes. With a poetic appreciation of the beauties ofnature, he desired no greater pleasure than to wander in perfectfreedom among our lochs and hills; and his descriptions of Edinburgh,the Highlands, and Western Islands, which appeared in the _AugsburgGazette_, have brought some and inspired more with the wish to visitthe Switzerland of Britain. The history and music of Scotland threwfresh light upon each other under his researches. He delighted totrace the reciprocal influence of national events and national music,from the time of the Culdee establishments of the sixth century, when'Iona was the Rome of the north,' down to the _Covenanter's Lament_,and the Jacobite songs of the last century. Since these days, thespirit that invented and handed down popular song has passed away withthe national and clannish feuds which gave rise to the gathering songand the lament. The age of peace has been heralded in by the songs ofBurns and Lady Nairne, the authoress of _The Land o' the Leal_, whohas done much to restore the taste for our beautiful old melodies, bywedding them to pure and appropriate verse.[2]In such pursuits, Mainzer--by this time dubbed doctor by a Germanuniversity--passed five years very pleasantly, but, in a worldly pointof view, very unprofitably. He had failed on first coming to Edinburghin obtaining the musical chair, which seemed so appropriate a nichefor him; and however reluctant to leave his favourite normal classesand his adopted home, still when he looked to the future, he wascompelled to think of leaving Edinburgh--for the German proverb stillheld true: 'Kunst geht nach brod;' and if man cannot live by bread_alone_, neither can the artist live _without_ bread! At thisjuncture, the Chevalier Neukomm, of European celebrity as a composerand organist, and a valued friend of Dr Mainzer, came to Edinburgh toinspect his friend's normal classes. He was so much delighted withthem, and considered Dr Mainzer so little appreciated by the generalpublic, that he persuaded him to try Manchester as his future field ofexertion.In the autumn of 1848, accordingly, Neukomm introduced Mainzer to theleading men of that city, who received him so cordially, that he atonce took his proper position, and entered on a career both useful andprofitable, and which continued to be increasingly successful, untilat Christmas 1850, he was laid aside by ill-health. Over-exertion hadbrought on a complication of diseases, to which he was a martyr forten months, and which terminated fatally on the 10th November 1851.During that long period of intense suffering, his active mind wasnever clouded nor repining, and at every interval of comparative ease,he read or listened to reading with avidity. During the first monthsof his illness, he superintended the publication of a new musicalwork, called _The Orpheon_, two numbers of which appeared; and hislast exertion in this way was arranging two songs: _The Sigh_ ofCharles Swain, and Longfellow's _Footsteps of Angels_, adapted toWeber's last song. Prophetic requiems both!A few weeks after his death, the hall which had been built inEdinburgh for the classes of the Association which he founded, wasopened by an amateur concert given as a tribute to his memory. He hadpromised to preside on this occasion; but his place was filled by hisaged, but still vigorous friend, the Chevalier Neukomm, who had cometo Edinburgh, at the request of the Association, to compose a seriesof psalms, one of which was sung by the pupils. Music for the Psalms,_adapted to the varying meaning of each verse_, has hitherto been adesideratum in the musical world; now being supplied in ChevalierNeukomm's work, and already subscribed for by no mean judges--theQueen and Prince Albert, the king of Prussia, &c. It was touching, andyet gratifying, to see one of Dr Mainzer's oft-cherished hopesrealised for the first time that evening--that of the _musical union_of accomplished amateurs of private life with the pupils of the normalclasses.Having thus briefly traced Dr Mainzer's life, it now remains to offera few remarks on his general character. His talents were of adiversified and high order; and those who knew him only as the authorof 'Singing for the Million,' were not aware of his generalcultivation of mind. In the dead and living languages, he was equallyat home: now he would be speculating on the formation of the Greekchorus, and again mastering some dialect of modern Europe, in order toelucidate the history of the people or their music and poetry. Hisliterary articles were sought after by all the leading journals inGermany and Paris; and his volumes of _Sketches of Travel_, and of_The Lower Orders in Paris_, are graphic and entertaining. A year ortwo ago, a _Notice Bibliographique_ of his works appeared in Paris,which contained a list of above thirty publications. Great diligence,joined to enthusiasm, enabled him to accomplish so much in thesevarious departments of literature. His manners, too, were of thatfrank, cordial, and agreeable tone which inspires confidence, andprepossessed every one in his favour; so that from all he could obtainthe information which he wished, and they could afford. Over hispupils, his influence was immense. He had the rare art of engaging theentire attention of children; and while he maintained strictdiscipline, he gained their warmest affection: his own earnestness wasreflected on the countenances of his pupils.Those alone who knew him in private life could thoroughly estimatethat purity of mind and heart which eminently characterised him, alongwith a childlike simplicity and unworldliness, which often, indeed,made him the prey of designing persons, but which, joined to hisgeneral information and cheerfulness, made his society mostattractive. His personal appearance was indicative of a delicate andnervous organisation: slight and fragile in figure, with anintellectual forehead and eye, that spoke of the preponderance of the_spirituelle_ in his idiosyncrasy; one of those minds which are everworking beyond the powers of the body; ever planning new achievementsand new labours of love, and which too often, alas! go out at noonday,while half their fond projects are unaccomplished, yet not before theyhave made a name to live, and left the world their debtors!FOOTNOTES:[1] See _Chambers's Journal_, No. 226, New Series.[2] See _Lays from Strathearn_, 4to.A NEWCASTLE PAPER IN 1765-6.There is scarcely anything more entertaining and instructive than aleisurely look over an old newspaper file. A newspaper of any age isan attraction, and the current newspaper something more, for it is nowa necessity. But the next place to it in point of interest is perhapsdue to the journal half a century, or two-thirds of a century old. Itintroduces us, if we be youthful, to the habits of our grandsires; andif we be in 'the sere, the yellow leaf,' to the habits of our fathers,more fully than the pleasantest novel or most elaborate essay, and farmore intimately than the most correct and complete historical records.It enables us to observe freely the position and avocations of thedenizens of the past, and catch hasty, but most suggestive glances atbygone days; it 'shews the very age and body of the time, its form andpressure.' It is a milestone from which we may reckon our progress,and must delight as well as surprise us by the advancement it shews usto have made in social and political life, particularly with regard tothose 'triumphs of mind over matter,' for which recent times have beenpre-eminently distinguished.The writer of this article had lately an opportunity of inspecting afile of the _Newcastle Chronicle_ for 1765-6, and the contrast betweenjournals and things in general which that examination forced on theattention, was in some respects sufficiently striking or curious tobe, in his opinion, deserving of some permanent record. At present,the journal in question almost, if not entirely, reaches 'the largestsize allowed by law;' at that time, it consisted merely of a singledemy sheet. Now, the Newcastle people would be amazed beyond measureif they did not receive at breakfast-time, on the morning ofpublication, the parliamentary, and all other important news of thenight; then, the latest London news was four days old. But a betteridea of the journal can perhaps be given, by stating what it lackedthan what it then contained. It had no leaders, no parliamentaryreports, and very little indeed, in any shape, that could be termedpolitical news. In these matters, its conductor had to say, withCanning's knife-grinder: 'Story! God bless you, I have none to tell,sir.' Not that the political world was unfruitful in affairs ofmoment; it was a time of no small change, interest, and excitement. Inthe period referred to, the Grenville ministry had endeavoured toburden the American colonies, by means of the stamp-duties, with someof the debt contracted in the late war. Thereupon, immense discontenthad arisen at home and abroad; that administration had fallen; and theRockingham ministry, which was then formed, found full employment (in1766) in undoing what had been effected in the previous year. How theGrafton ministry was next formed; how the unfortunate design of taxingthe colonists was revived; and how that policy ended, readers ofEnglish history know full well. John Wilkes, too, had been alreadypersecuted into prominence, although not yet forced up to the heightof his popularity with the masses. But, notwithstanding these andother stirring incidents, the _Chronicle_ was, politically speaking,almost a blank. From time to time, it was stated that the royal assenthad been given to certain measures; but concerning the preparation anddiscussion of those measures, nothing was known. A few other politicalfacts of interest, indeed, such as the arrival of Wilkes in Londonfrom France; the repeal of the obnoxious Stamp Act; the riots of theSpitalfields weavers on account of the importation of French silks;and an attack upon the Speaker, and many of the members of the Dublinparliament, who were grossly insulted, and kept from going to theHouse, in consequence of 'a report that parliament designed to imposemore taxes,' were also curtly noticed. Political rumours abounded,although positive knowledge of that kind was exceedingly scanty; andthe little that could be obtained was eked out by inuendo, rather thanby venturing on any direct statement. The familiarity which, accordingto the proverb, is apt to breed contempt, was not then indulged inwith reference to rulers, parliaments, or even agitators. The emperorof Russia was alluded to under the title of 'a great northernpotentate;' parliament was spoken of as 'a certain august assembly;'and Wilkes was usually entitled, 'a certain popular gentleman.'Some of the political rumours are worthy of republication. Thesubjoined, from the London news of July 29, 1766, serves to shew howlong a political change may be mooted before its effect is tried inthis country: 'It is said, a bill will be brought into parliament nextsession, binding elections for members of parliament to be by ballot.'And, without at all entering into the discussion of political topics,it may perhaps be observed that the following, taken from the_Chronicle_ of August 10, 1765, points out how an evil of the presentday has long been felt and acknowledged: 'We hear the electors of acertain borough have been offered 3000 guineas for a seat, thoughthere is but so short a time for the session of the presentparliament.'Great surprise is expressed (1766) that the consumption of coal inLondon 'hath increased from 400,000 odd to 600,000 chaldrons yearly.'We find that the coal imported into London during the first six monthsof 1851, amounted to 1,527,527 tons, besides 90,975 tons brought intothe metropolis during the same period by railway and canal. 'Carryingcoal to Newcastle' proved a successful speculation on September 25,1765, when, on account of a strike among the pitmen, 'several pokes ofcoal were brought to this town by one of the common carriers, and soldon the Sandhill for 9d. a poke, by which he cleared 6d. a poke.' Aboutthe same time, wheat was selling in Darlington and Richmond for 4s.and 4s. 6d. per bushel, after having been nearly double that priceonly two or three weeks previously. In the number for June 25, 1766,we have the following quotation from a Doncaster letter:--'Corn soldlast market-day from 12s. to 14s. per quarter; meat, from 2-1/2d. to3d. per pound; fowls, and other kinds of poultry, had no price, beingmostly carried home. I wish a scheme was set on foot, to run many sucharticles to London by land-carriage; there is plenty here.' In thesame paper, the prices of grain in London are given: wheat, 36s. to41s.; barley, 22s. to 25s.; oats, 16s. to 20s.Recently, the Newcastle papers, led on by the _Chronicle_, have beenmaking strenuous efforts to extend the French coal-trade, but suchexertions formed no part of the 'wisdom of our ancestors.' The numberfor June 15, 1765, informs us that 'some sinister designs forexporting a very considerable quantity of coals to France andelsewhere, have lately been discovered and prevented.' Sturdy Britonshad then far too much hatred for 'our natural enemies' to wish toexchange aught but hostilities with them. About the same time, welearn that 'clubs of young gentlemen of fortune' had come to themagnanimous resolve, 'to toast no lady who has so much inconsiderationas to lavish her money away in French fopperies, to the detriment ofher own country.'The style of advertising then in vogue occasionally gave the paper asomewhat pictorial appearance. Cockfighting was in great force, andthe public announcements relative to this barbarous sport wereinvariably headed by a portraiture of a couple of game-birds facingeach other with a most belligerent aspect; while the numerousadvertisements of horses 'stolen or strayed,' were embellished by arepresentation of the supposed thief, mounted on the missing animal,which was forced into a breakneck pace, while Satan himself, _inpropria persona_, was perched on the crupper, in an excited andtriumphant attitude. In the local paragraphs, we note severalindicating a strong feeling of animosity between the Scotch andEnglish borderers. We observe also that the Newcastle dogs--to thisday a very numerous fraternity--were at times quite unmanageable, andcaused, either by their ravenous exploits, or their downright madness,no small uneasiness to the town and neighbourhood. It must beconfessed, that in its marriage-notices, at least, the _Chronicle_ wasfar superior to anything that journalism can now exhibit in Newcastleor in Great Britain. These interesting announcements must haveintensely delighted our grandmothers; and, we fear, have frequentlytempted our grandsires into a somewhat precipitate plunge into thegulf of matrimony. Instead of barely specifying, as papers now do,that Mr Smith married Miss Brown, the _Chronicle_ uniformly tantalisedits bachelor readers with an account of the personal, mental, and, ifsuch there were, metallic charms of the bride; so that how any singlegentleman, in the teeth of such notifications, could retain hiscondition for long, is really marvellous. Most of the young ladies whohad thus bestowed themselves on their fortunate admirers, aredescribed as 'sprightly,' and many as 'genteel and agreeable;' somehave 'a genteel fortune,' other's 'a considerable fortune,' andothers, again, rejoice in the possession of 'a large fortune:' one mangains 'a well-accomplished young lady, with a fortune of L.1000;'another takes unto himself 'an agreeable widow lady, with a fortune ofL.2000;' a third marches off with 'a young lady endowed with everyaccomplishment to make the marriage state happy, with a fortune ofL.5000;' while a fourth _Benedict_, more lucky still, obtains 'a mostamiable, affable, and agreeable young lady, with a fortune ofL.10,000.' We suppose that the best excuse newspaper editors now havefor being less florid in their matrimonial announcements is, thatwhere the papers formerly had one, they have now at least a dozen ofthese interesting notices; so that their brevity may be less owing tothe want of gallantry than to the want of space.So extremely meagre was the news, both foreign and domestic, that aconsiderable portion of the four small pages of the _Chronicle_ wasusually devoted to literature. Extracts were frequently given from theworks of Johnson, Smollett, and other popular writers, and a columnwas often occupied by an essay from a contributor to the paper,generally treating of some social evil or peculiarity, but neverintermeddling with local or general politics. These effusionsdisplayed a very respectable amount of ability, and the generalgetting-up, or what would now be termed the sub-editing of the paper,was also performed with care and ability. The scraps of news werealways presented rewritten and carefully condensed, instead of theloose 'scissors-and-paste' style of publication adopted by manyprovincial papers of the present day. Notices not only of localtheatricals, but of histrionic matters at Old Drury, were occasionallygiven; the number for March 15, 1766, containing a well-writtencriticism of '_The Clandestine Marriage; a New Comedy_,' performedthere. As the _Chronicle_ thus had to leave politics for literature,we may perhaps, in our turn, digress from a consideration of itspages, to note briefly that this period was set in the very midst ofthe celebrated Georgian era, in which this country could boast of moredistinguished men--especially in literature--than at any other period.In about twenty previous years, many great ones had departed--notablyPope, Thomson, Fielding. Richardson also had died in 1761, andShenstone in 1763; the author of the _Night-Thoughts_ survived till1765, when his burial was announced in the _Chronicle_ of April 27.At this time (1765-6), Dr Johnson had reached the zenith of his fame;Gray was becoming popular; Smollett had written most of his novels;Goldsmith was about to present the world with his exquisite _Vicar ofWakefield_; Gibbon had returned to England from Rome with the idea of_The Decline and Fall_ floating in his brain; Thomas Chatterton,          ----'the marvellous boy,    The sleepless soul that perished in his pride,'had already given proofs of his wondrous precocity; the genuinesailor-poet, Falconer, had lately published _The Shipwreck_; LaurenceSterne had just collected the materials for his _Sentimental Journey_;Sir William Blackstone had published his celebrated _Commentaries_;Wesley and Whitefield had not yet ended their useful career; the starof Edmund Burke was rising; and Jeremy Bentham, being then (1766) butseventeen years of age, had taken his master's degree at Oxford,although, it is true, the first literary performance of the eccentricphilosopher did not appear till some years later. Home, Moore, andColman, had appeared successfully as dramatists, and were about to befollowed by Macklin, Cumberland, Goldsmith, and Sheridan. Newcastle ordistrict celebrities of the time included Mark Akenside, the author of_The Pleasures of the Imagination_; Dr Thomas Percy, dean of Carlisle,who published, in 1765, his _Reliques of English Poetry_; and Dr JohnLanghorne, a northern divine of no small popularity in his day as apoet. Among other illustrious living men, were Horace Walpole, HenryMackenzie, Blair, Hume, Adam Smith, Dr Robertson, Garrick, Reynolds;and last, not least, William Pitt, who, in 1766, was created Earl ofChatham.But let us return to our more immediate purpose--that of making a fewselections from the _Chronicle_, some of which will doubtless reflectfar less credit on the age than the enumeration we have just made ofeminent individuals. Now and then, a duel took place in Hyde Park. Theamusements of some of our aristocrats did not always exhibit them inany very dignified position, as witness the subjoined:--'Sir CharlesBunbury ran 100 yards at Newmarket for 1000 guineas, against a tailorwith 40 lb. weight of cabbage, _alias_ shreds.'Here is a paragraph, from the number for March 15, 1766, relative tothe recreations of some less elevated in the social scale: 'Sundaymorning, a little before three o'clock, a match at marbles was playedunder the piazza at Covent Garden by the light of thirty-two links (byseveral rogues well known in that circle), for twenty guineas a side.'A few other quotations may be deemed worthy of republication, althoughsome of them may have no direct or important bearing. The audacity ofhighway robbers at this period is known to everybody. The following,dated December 21, 1765, gives a tolerably correct idea of the usualstyle adopted by those gentlemen of the road:--'Thursday, the Leedsand Leicester stage-coaches were stopped on Finchley Common by ahighwayman, who took from the passengers a considerable sum of money.A nobleman's cook, a young woman about twenty-five, declared she wouldnot be robbed, when the highwayman, admiring her courage, let heralone. He broke the coach-glass with his pistol, and gave the coachmanhalf-a-crown to get it mended.' News from London, dated January 9,1765, says: 'Early on Tuesday morning, a member of parliament, on hisreturn home in a chair to his house in New Palace Yard, was stoppedand robbed by a single footpad of his purse, in which were sixty-threeguineas.'About the same time, we are informed that 'the celebrated J.J.Rousseau hath for the present taken up his residence at a friend'shouse in Putney.'--The number for October 26, 1765, contains anadvertisement of a 'beggar's stand' (copied from the _PublicAdvertiser_), 'to be let, in a charitable neighbourhood. Income, about30s. a week.'The following reference to our acquaintances, the Sikhs, nowsufficiently well known, is curious, as it is doubtless one of theirfirst appearances in the columns of the English press. It is datedJuly 5, 1766: 'The Seyques, an idolatrous people inhabiting theneighbourhood of Cachemire, whose name was hardly known two years ago,have beaten Abdaly and the Patanes whom he commanded.' Modern Cockneyswould stare to read a paragraph like this: 'A great deal of grass hathbeen cut down about Islington, Kentish-Town,' &c.We will conclude our selections, which have now grown quite desultoryand miscellaneous, by the brief obituary of a 'remarkable' man, fromthe _Chronicle_ of July 26, 1766: 'Thursday, died at his house nearHampstead, the Rev. Mr Southcote, remarkable for having a leg ofmutton every night for supper during a course of forty years, smokingten pipes as constantly, and drinking three bottles of port.'GENIUS FOR EMIGRATION.Lady E. Stuart Wortley, in the account of her journey in America,mentions that she saw a man proceeding on foot across the Isthmus ofPanama, bound for the Pacific, carrying a huge box on his back thatwould almost have contained a house. It was really a dreadful thing tosee the poor man, full-cry for California, toiling along with hisenormous burden, under a tropical sun, the heat of which he requiredto endure through forty miles of wilderness, and no chance of reliefor refreshment by the way. Yet this serio-comic spectacle is notsingular. Multitudes seem to have gone to the diggings with everyspecies of encumbrance, and in a totally unsuitable garb. Splendiddress-coats and waistcoats, boots and pantaloons, but noworking-clothes, nor implements for camping, and in many instances noteven a cloak: everything suitable for the enjoyment of their goldenpromises, with nothing to assist in realising them.Nearly the same thing has occurred in innumerable instances as regardsAustralia. The men going thither must in general be shepherds or theirmasters; and to be either to any purpose, they must go far into thebush. For this they required a talent for constructing huts forthemselves and servants, and hurdles for the cattle, and consequentlytools to assist them; but they often went without either tools ortalents, and so had to pay extravagantly for very common services.They may have had common clothes, but they had made no provision forliving far from the assistance of women; and consequently, if acoat-sleeve was torn, it must hang just as it was; if a stocking wasout at heel, having neither needles nor worsted, nor the power ofusing them, they had no other resource but to _tie_ the _hole_together. They had no idea of washing and dressing, and consequentlymust want clean linen, or stockings, and every other article of cleanapparel, till a woman could be heard of, and bribed to assist them.The consequence was, that it was cheaper to buy new articles thaneither wash or mend the old. It is doubtful whether many had notomitted to learn to shave themselves, or to provide razors or strops,or even scissors.Then as to baking bread, or cooking the humblest meal, they wereequally at a loss. They seem to have had no idea of the humblestgrate, or even of a flat and easily-cleaned stone for a hearth; andso, having kneaded their 'damper,' it is never said how they thrust itin the ashes till it was partially heated, and comparatively fit tobe eaten. They have mutton, and mutton only; but how cooked is equallyunknown. It is not known that they have any apparatus whatever, stewor frying pan, or even a hook and string. Yet the natives of Scotlandmay have seen many things nicely baked by means of a hot hearthstonebelow, a griddle with live coals above, and burning turf all round. Asingle pot with water is a boiler; with the juice of the meat, orlittle more, a stew-pan; or merely surrounded by fire, an oven: but itis believed many have not that single pot. Even the cheap crock thatholds salted meat might also be turned into a pudding-dish; and such avessel as that which of old held the ashes of the dead, and nowoccasionally holds salt, the French peasant often turns into a_pot-au-feu_--a pot for boiling his soup--and makes that soup out ofdocks and nettles collected by the wayside, with a littlemeal--delicious if seasoned with salt and a scrap of meat, or awell-picked lark or sparrow, or even a nicely-skinned and washed thighof a frog!The natives of New Holland themselves get fat upon serpentswell-killed--that is, with the heads adroitly cut off, so as not tosuffer the poison to go through the body; or upon earth or tree wormsnicely roasted. The Turks roast their _kebabs_--something near tomutton-chops--by holding them to the fire on skewers. But theinhabitants of Great Britain, accustomed to comforts unknown to anyother part of the world, are, when deprived of these comforts, themost helpless in the world.The natives of Ireland might be supposed to be excellent subjects foremigration, for at home they have often only straw and rags for beds,stones for seats, and one larger in the middle for a table; while thebasket or 'kish' that washes the potatoes, receives them again whenboiled: so that the pot and basket are the only articles of furniture.Simplicity beyond this is hardly conceivable: there is but one stepbeyond it--wanting the pot, and throwing the potatoes, however cooked,broadcast upon the stone-table; and this is possible by roastingthe potatoes in the embers. The Guachos of South America teach howeven the most savoury meal of beef may be obtained without potor oven--namely, by roasting it in the skin! It is called_carne-con-cuero_--flesh in the skin--and is pronounced delicious.Diogenes threw away his dish, his only article of furniture, uponseeing a boy drink from his hand; and after this example, an Irishmanmight throw away his pot; though we would not recommend him to do so.Unless people know how to prepare food, they may starve in the midstof comparative plenty. It is alleged--though we do not vouch for thefact--that when wheat and maize were carried into Ireland and givengratis, the famine was not stayed. Though they had the wheat andmaize, they could not grind them; if ground, they could not cookthem--they had neither vessels nor fuel; if vessels and fuel weregiven, they were still unable to assist themselves--they had not skillto cook them; and if cooked, they could not eat them--they had neverbeen accustomed to do so! Such are the effects of carrying contentmenttoo far: the individual becomes wholly resourceless.We try to induce them to fish with the same results. If we give themboats, they have no nets; give them nets, they know not how to usethem; teach them to use them, and they can neither cook nor eat thefish; and as to selling them for other comforts, there is no market!Without a knowledge of agriculture, or fishing, or even talents tofeed themselves, such men are useless in any quarter, unless assubjects to be taught; and now at last, but greatly too late, they arebeing taught, and the much-abused railway will carry their produce tothe market.The Scottish Celt is more shifty. In the old days when he had fleshand little else to eat, he could broil it on the coals; and a Scotchcollop is perhaps equal to a Turkish kebob. We wonder if in Australiathe long-forgotten Scotch collop has been revived? It requires nocooking-vessels. It may be held to the fire on a twig, or laid on thecoals and turned by a similar twig--bent into a collop-tongs--or evenby the fingers.In the Rebellion of 1745, the Scoto-Celt could knead into a cake themeal, which he carried as his sole provision, and knew that it oughtto be fired upon a griddle; but if he had no other convenience, hecould knead it in his bonnet, and eat it raw, and go forth to meet andconquer the best-appointed soldiers in Europe. It was only when atlast he had neither rest nor food that he was dispersed--notconquered. A lowland Scot is better. With a dish and hot water, and ofcourse the meal and salt, he can make _brose_, and live and thriveupon it.How John Bull, who in his own country is carnivorous, and will havehis roast-pig on Sunday, if he should slave all the week--how he getson in a new country, is more doubtful. Very likely, having more wants,he makes more provision for them; but as below a certain rank he isnot a writing animal, less is known of his successes or difficulties.For our own part, we think we would have made an excellent Crusoe, andyour Crusoe is the only man for a new country.Some years ago, we travelled over the backbone of Scotland, andreturned somewhat on its western fin, both on foot; and all ourequipments were a travelling dress, a stout umbrella, and a parcel inwax-cloth strapped on our left shoulder, not larger than is generallyseen in the hands of a commercial traveller--that is, twelve inches bysix or eight; and yet we never wanted for anything. It is true we hadgenerally the convenience of inns by the way; but if by our_Traveller's Guide_ (which we also carried) we saw the stage was to belong, an oaten cake, with a _plug_ of wheaten bread for the lastmouthful, to keep down heartburn, and a slice of cold beef or ham, ora hard-boiled egg, were ample provisions. Drink? There was no lack ofdrink. Springs of the most beautiful water were frequent by theroadside, and constantly bubbling up, without noise or motion, throughthe purest sand, though heaven only was looking upon them; and asingle leaf from our memorandum-book, formed into the shape of agrocer's twist as wanted, served us as a drinking-cup throughout thejourney. Had we even been overtaken by night, it was summer, and a bedunder whins, or upon heather, with our umbrella set against the wind,and secured to us, would have been delightful. Once, indeed, we fearedthis would have been our fate; for on the very top of Corryarrick, andconsequently nine miles or more from house or home in any direction,we sprained our ankle, or rather an old sprain returned. To allappearance, we were done for, and might have sat stiff for days orweeks by the solitary spring that happened to be near at the instant.But a piece of flannel from the throat, and a tape from the wondrousparcel, enabled us again to wag; and we finished our allotted journeyto Dalwhinnie in time for dinner, tea, and supper in one--and then toour journal with glorious serenity!Our arrangements for the continent were equally simple. When we wereasked to shew our luggage, on entering France, we produced aportmanteau nine inches by six. 'Voila ma magasin!' It was opened, andthere were certainly some superfluities, though natural enough in anincipient traveller. 'Une plume pour ecrire l'Histoire de laFrance!'--'Un cahier pour la meme!' And the intending historian ofFrance, even with his imported pen and paper-book, and also threeshirts and some pairs of socks, was allowed to go to his dinner, withhis _magasin_ in his hand, and start by the first conveyance; whilehis less fortunate fellow-travellers had to dine in absence of theirluggage, and perhaps give the town that had the honour of being theirlanding-place, the profit of their company for the night.But what is the use of all these insinuations of aptitude forcolonisation, when there is not such another man in the world? We begpardon; but we have actually discovered such another, and to introducehim suitably has been the sole aim of our existence in writing thisinteresting preface. In a most authentic newspaper, we find thefollowing admirable history, copied from the _New York Express_:--'A man who had been an unsuccessful delver in the mines of Georgia, onhearing the thrilling news of the gold placers of California, had hisspirit quickened within him; and although he had arrived at anage--being about sixty--when the fires of youth usually cease to burnwith vigour, he fixed his eyes upon the far-distant and butlittle-known country, and resolved that he would wend his way thitheralone, and even in the absence of that friend, generally thoughtindispensable, money, of which he was wholly destitute.'Under such circumstances, it would not avail to think of a passageround "The Horn," or by the more uncertain, and at the same timeimperfected route, across the Isthmus. But as California was on thiscontinent, he knew that there was a way thither, though it might leadthrough trackless deserts and barren wastes. These were not enough todaunt his determined spirit. He bent his way to the "Father ofWaters," and worked his way as he could, till he found himself at"Independence," in health, and with no less strength, and with 150dollars in his purse. He had no family to provide for, or evencompanion to care for, on the route which he was about to enter. Yetsome things were necessary for himself; and to relieve his body fromthe pressure of a load, he provided himself with a wheel-barrow, onwhich to place his traps.'It must not be supposed that our hero was ignorant of the largenumber of emigrants that was moving over the plains, and it is quiteprobable that his sagacity was precocious enough to look ahead at theresult of attempting to carry forward such ponderous loads, and such avariety of at least dispensable things as the earlier parties startedwith. A detailed list of the 'amount and variety of goods and wares,useful and superfluous, including many of the appendages of refinedand fashionable life, would astonish the reader. Our hero was not in ahurry. He reasoned thus: "The world was not made in a day; the race isnot always for the swift." He trundled along his barrow, enjoying thecomforts of his pipe, the object of wonder to many, and the subject ofmuch sportive remark to those who were hurried along by their freshand spirited teams on their first days.'Many weeks had not passed, however, before our traveller had tangibleevidence that trouble had fallen to the lot of some who had precededhim. A stray ox was feeding on his track: the mate of which, heafterwards learned, was killed, and this one turned adrift as useless.He coaxed this waif to be the companion of his journey, taking care tostop where he could provide himself with the needful sustenance. Hehad not travelled far before he found a mate for his ox, and ere longa wagon, which had given way in some of its parts, and been abandonedby its rightful owner, and left in the road. Our travelling genius wasaroused to turn these mishaps to his own advantage; so he wentstraightway to work to patch and bolster up the wagon, bound hisfaithful oxen to it, and changed his employment from trundling awheel-barrow to driving a team. Onward moved the new establishment,the owner gathering as he went, from the superabundance of those whohad gone before him, various articles of utility--such as flour,provisions of all kinds, books, implements, even rich carpets, &c.which had been cast off as burdensome by other travellers. He wouldoccasionally find poor worn-out animals that had been left behind, andas it was not important for him to speed his course, he gathered themtogether, stopping where there was abundance of grass, long enough forhis cattle to gain a little strength and spirit. Time rolled on, andhis wagon rolled with it, till he reached the end of his journey, whenit was discovered that he had an uncommon fine team and a good wagon,&c. which produced him on the sale 2500 dollars.'Being now relieved of the care of his team, and in the midst of thegold-diggings, he soon closed his prospecting by a location; and whileall around him were concentrating their strength to consummate thework of years in a few months, he deliberately commenced building,finishing, and, as fast as he could, furnishing, a comfortable cabin.His wood he gathered and regularly piled in a straight line andperpendicular by the door, convenient as though the old lady had beenwithin to provide his meals. He acted upon the adage, "Never to starttill you are ready." Now our hero was ready to commence working his"claim;" and this he did, as he did everything else, steadily andsystematically.'He may yet be seen at his work, with the prospect--if he lives to bean old man--of being rich; for in the last two years he hasaccumulated 10,000 dollars.'Need we add a word? This is decidedly the kind of man foremigrating--or, indeed, for remaining at home. We, being of his owncharacter, can conceive his delicious nights of camping out, his headunder his wheel-barrow, until he arrived at the dignity of a wagon;his principal luggage being perhaps a coverlet, to preserve him fromthe cold in sleep, and a gun that unscrewed, and its appendages, toprovide him a fresh bird or beef. It is very probable that he soughtneither of these, but was contented with something concentrated andpreserved, and thus feasted; and with a drink from some deliciousspring, or from a bottle--that could not be broken--supplied at thelast spring he had passed, lay down conscious of his progress, wellsatisfied with the past, and hopeful of the future.On his arrival at his destination, his conduct is equally exemplary.Every one should provide for the preservation of life and health asfirst measures; and if not done at a rate which future exertions arelikely to render profitable, why make the expenditure? Now, manyare in all these new adventures expending on inevitablenecessities--having made no previous provision for them--such sums asrender all their exertions hopeless; while at the same time they aresacrificing health and strength.The government of Australia has certainly been very successful inpreserving order at the gold placers there, and has given its sanctionupon moderate terms; for here, we believe, gold and silver mines are_inter regalia_, and could have been entirely seized by the crown. Wesincerely trust it will appropriate the great and unexpected revenuethence arising in improving the roads through this magnificentcountry, and providing shelter for the traveller; for at this moment,many of the roads being over the steepest mountains, and the gradientsunmitigated by cuttings, or any other act of engineering whatever,they are all but impassable, and are travelled with the greatesttorture to the unfortunate animals concerned. It was the reproach ofSpain, that though in possession of South America for centuries, shehad formed few roads; and that the few formed were bad, and theaccommodation in their neighbourhood of the worst description--oftenopen sheds, without food or furniture, or indeed inhabitants; or ifinhabited, with only stones for seats, and raised mounds of earth forbeds. Even now, in little more than half a century, things are betterin Australia than this, at least wherever government has extended. Butthere is a vast deal more to be done; and it is a pity that in thefirst place suitable schools are not formed for the persons intendingto emigrate, and opportunity given them to do so, without thedegradation of crime, and the expense and disgrace of conviction.EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYED.The _Westminster Review_ for January, in an able and temperatearticle, entitled _Employers and Employed_, delineates the progress ofthe working power from the original condition of _serfdom_, throughthat of _vassalage_, which prevailed in the middle ages, to the systemof simple contract in which we now find it in France and America. Thisthe writer regards as part of a universal progress towards a more andmore equalised condition of the various orders of men--'an equality,not perhaps of wealth, or of mind, or of inherent power, but of socialcondition, and of individual rights and freedom.' In England, however,we are only in a state of transition from that relation of protectionon the one hand, and respect or loyalty on the other, whichconstituted the system of vassalage, to the true democratic relationwhich assumes a perfect equality and independence in the contractingparties. 'The master cannot divest himself of the idea, that in virtueof his rank he is entitled to deference and submission; and theworkman conceives that, in virtue of his comparative poverty, he isentitled to assistance in difficulty, and to protection from theconsequences of his own folly and improvidence. Each party expectsfrom the other something more than is expressed or implied in thecovenant between them. The workman, asserting his equality andindependence, claims from his employer services which only inferioritycan legitimately demand; the master, tacitly and in his heart denyingthis equality and independence, repudiates claims which only thevalidity of this plea of equality and independence can effectuallynonsuit or liquidate.'Arguing that 'the reciprocal duties of employers and employed, _assuch_, are comprised within the limits of their covenant,' the writergoes on to say, that nevertheless there remains a relation of'fellow-citizenship and of Christian _neighbourhood_,' by virtue ofwhich the employer owes service to his work-people, seeing that 'everyman owes service to every man whom he is in a position to serve.' Letnot the Pharisaic fundholder and lazy mortgagee suppose that the greatemployers of labour are thus under a peculiar obligation from which_they_ are exempt. The obligation is assumed to be equal upon all whohave power and means; and it only lies with special weight at the doorof the employer of multitudes, in as far as he is in a situation toexercise influence over their character and conduct, and usually hasgreater means of rendering aid suited to their particular necessities.Before proceeding to expound the various duties thus imposed upon theemployer, the writer lays down a primary duty as essential to the dueperformance of the rest--namely, he must see to making his businesssucceed; and for this end he must possess a sufficient capital atstarting; and he must not, for any reasons of vanity or benevolence,or through laxness, pay higher wages than the state of thelabour-market and the prospects of trade require. Of the secondaryduties which next come in course--and which, be it remembered, arisenot from the mastership, but from the neighbourship--the first is thatof 'making his factory, and the processes carried on there, as healthyas care and sanitary science can render them.' 'This is the moreincumbent upon him, as it is little likely to be thought of ordemanded by his workmen. It is a topic on which his cultivatedintelligence is almost sure to place him far ahead of them; and out ofthe superiority, as we have seen, springs the obligation.' Ourreviewer adds the remark, that, 'in the minor workshops, andespecially in the work-rooms of tailors and seamstresses, theemployers are still, for the most part, unawakened to the importanceand imperativeness of this class of obligations. The health ofthousands is sacrificed from pure ignorance and want of thought.'One mode of serving those who work for him, which the circumstancesrender appropriate, is to provide them with decent and comfortabledwellings. Much has been done in this way. 'In almost all countryestablishments, and in most of those in the smaller towns, theemployers have been careful to surround their mills with substantialand well-built cottages, often with gardens attached to them,containing four rooms--kitchen, scullery, and two bedrooms: cottageswhich are let for rents which at once remunerate the owner and areeasy for the occupier.' Even in large towns, where there are greatlocal difficulties, something has been done by the building of ModelLodging-houses, and by the efforts of Societies for improving theDwellings of the Poor. The writer specifies one of the greatestdifficulties as existing in the working-people themselves: whenprovided with a variety of rooms for the separation of the variousmembers of their families, they are very apt to defeat the whole planby taking in lodgers, and contenting themselves with the filthy anddepraving huddlement out of which their benevolent superiorsendeavoured to rescue them. But it may be hoped that, by promotingonly a few of the more intelligent and better-disposed to suchimproved dwellings, and thus setting up good examples, the multitudemight in time be trained to an appreciation of the decency and comfortof ampler accommodation. Another wide field of usefulness is open tothe employers in the establishment of schools, reading-rooms, baths,wash-houses, and the like.It strikes us that the writer of this article is not true to his ownprinciple in his view of the duties of the employer. We readily grantthe duty of making his business prosperous and his workshops healthy.To fail in the latter particular especially, were not merely to failin a duty, but to incur a heavy positive blame. But we cannot see howit is incumbent on the employer to provide houses for the persons whoenter into the labour-contract with him, any more than to see thatthey get their four-pound loaf of a certain quality or price. It maybe a graceful thing, a piece of noble benevolence, to enter into thesebuilding schemes, but it is also to go back into that system ofvassalage out of which it is assumed that the relation of employer andemployed is passing. Either the new buildings will pay asspeculations, or they will not. If they are sure to pay, ordinaryspeculators will be as ready to furnish them as bakers are to sellbread. If the contrary be the case, why burden with the actual orprobable loss the party in a simple contract which involves no suchobligation? Clearly, there must be no great reason to expect a fairreturn for capital laid out in this way, or we should see buildingschemes for the working-classes taken up extensively by ordinaryspeculators. For employers, then, to enter into such plans, must insome degree be the result of benevolent feelings towards their men;and, so far, we must hold there is an acknowledgment on both sidesthat the system of vassalage is not yet extinct amongst us, and thatthe time for its extinction is not yet come.If we look, however, at the entire condition of the working-people ofEngland, we shall see that it acknowledges the same truth in some ofits broadest features. When a time of depression comes, and factoriesdo not require half of their usual number of hands, or even so many,it is never expected, on any hand, that the superfluous labourers areto maintain themselves till better times return. The employer isexpected to keep them in his service, at least on short time, and at areduced remuneration, although at a ruinous loss to himself. Theworkmen, though well aware of the contingency, make little or noprovision against it, but calmly trust to the funds of theiremployers, or the contributions of the class to which these belong.Now, while such a practice exists, the relation of employer andemployed is not that of independent contractors, but so far that ofthe feudal baron and his villeins, or of a chieftain and his'following.' It is, in effect, a voluntarily maintained slavery on thepart of the operatives--a habit as incompatible with political libertyas with moral dignity and progress, and therefore a sore evil in ourstate. Obviously, to perfect the system of independent contract, theworkmen would need to redeem themselves from that condition of utter_unprovidedness_ in which the great bulk of them are for the presentcontent to live. Instead of what we see so prevalent now--a sort ofhopelessness as to the benefits of saving--a dread to let it be knownor imagined of them that they possess any store, lest it lead to areduction of their wages (a foolish fallacy), or deprive them of aclaim on their employer's consideration in the event of a period ofdepression (a mean and unworthy fear), we must see a dignified senseof independence, resting on the possession of some kind of property,before we can expect that even this stage in the Progress of Labourshall be truly reached.But is it not just one of the essential disadvantages attending thecontract system, or may we rather call it the system of weekly hire,that while it prompts the employer to frugality, by the obviousbenefits to him of constant accumulation, it leaves the employed, as amass, without a sufficient motive to the same virtue, and thus insurestheir being retained in that unprovidedness which forbids independenceand true social dignity? On this point, were we a workman, we shouldbe sorry to rest in an affirmative, or to allow it to slacken ourexertions or sap our self-denial; because if there is a higherdevelopment of the labouring state in store for society, it can onlybe attained by the more speedy perfection of the contract state in_the entire independence of the workman_. The writer from whom we havequoted thinks, and with his sentiments we entirely concur, that'society, in its progress towards an ideal state, may have to undergomodifications, compared with which all previous ones will seemtrifling and superficial. Of one thing only can we feelsecure--namely, that the loyal and punctual discharge of all theobligations arising out of existing social relations will best hallow,beautify, and elevate those relations, if they are destined to bepermanent; and will best prepare a peaceful and beneficent advent fortheir successors, if, like so much that in its day seemed eternal,they too are doomed to pass away.'ANECDOTE OF THE FIELD OF SHERRIFMUIR.My grandfather, William Wilson, was born in the farmhouse of Drumbrae,on the estate of Airthrey, at no great distance from the field ofSherrifmuir. At the rebellion of 1715, he was a lad of fifteen yearsof age, and learning that the rebels under the Earl of Mar had metwith the royal forces under the Duke of Argyle in the neighbourhood,on the morning of Sunday the 12th November, while it was still dusk,he went to the top of a neighbouring hill named Glentye, from whichthe whole of the moor was discernible, and on which a number ofcountry people were stationed, attracted to the spot, like himself, bycuriosity. Being at no great distance from both armies, he could seethem distinctly. The Highlanders, who observed no regular order, hecompared to a large, dark, formless cloud, forming a striking contrastto the regular lines and disciplined appearance of the royal army.After observing them for some space of time, an orderly dragoon, sentby the Duke of Argyle, rode up to the spot where the spectators stood,warning them to remove from a position in which they were in as greatdanger as the combatants themselves. My grandfather accordinglyreturned home, listening with awe to the sharp report of musketry,intermixed with the booming of cannon, which now informed him that thebattle had commenced. He had not been long in the house when adismounted dragoon made his appearance, requesting to have his leftwrist bandaged, so as to stop the blood. The hand had been cut off,and his horse killed under him, and he was on his way to Stirling toseek surgical aid. While his wishes were being complied with, heoccupied himself in taking some refreshment, till one of thefarm-servants came in and warned him that four armed Highlanders werecoming down the hill in the direction of the house. The soldier, whohad no doubt been taught at the Marlborough school, and served perhapsat Ramillies and Blenheim, immediately went out to the front of thehouse, which concealed him from his enemies. Presently, he heard bythe footsteps that one was near, when he instantly presented himselfat the gable, and shot the foremost Highlander with his carbine; then,seeing that the others came on in Indian file, with short distancesbetween, he advanced to meet them, dropped the second with a bulletfrom his pistol, and cut down the third with his sword. The fourth,seeing the fate of his comrades, took to flight. After this wholesaleexecution, the dragoon, with perfect coolness, returned to the house,finished his repast, tranquilly said his thanks and adieus, and wentoff in the direction of Stirling. The next morning the country peoplewere summoned to bury the dead. The ground was thickly covered withcranreuch, and life still remained in numbers of both armies, whobegged earnestly for water. But what struck my grandfatherparticularly was, that the heads and bodies of a great many of theslain royalists were horribly mutilated by the claymores of theHighlanders; while on those of the Highlanders themselves nothing wasobserved but the wound which had caused their death.--_Communicated byMr Alexander Wilson, shoemaker, Stirling._THINNESS OF A SOAP-BUBBLE.A soap-bubble as it floats in the light of the sun reflects to the eyean endless variety of the most gorgeous tints of colour. Newtonshewed, that to each of these tints corresponds a certain thickness ofthe substance forming the bubble; in fact, he shewed, in general, thatall transparent substances, when reduced to a certain degree oftenuity, would reflect these colours. Near the highest point of thebubble, just before it bursts, is always observed a spot whichreflects no colour and appears black. Newton shewed that the thicknessof the bubble at this black point was the 2,500,000th part of an inch!Now, as the bubble at this point possesses the properties of water asessentially as does the Atlantic Ocean, it follows that the ultimatemolecules forming water must have less dimensions than thisthickness.--_Lardner's Handbook._ENGLISH PLOUGHING.The following, written from England, is going the round of the papers,and is as true as the gospel, in my opinion. I have seen betterploughing here with a pair of oxen than in the old country with fivehorses; but Johnny won't learn. 'Lord! only look at five great,elephant-looking beasts in one plough, with one great lummokin fellowto hold the handle, and another to carry the whip, and a boy to lead,whose boots have more iron on them than the horses' hoofs have, allcrawling as if going to a funeral! What sort of a way is that to dowork? It makes me mad to look at 'em. If there is any airthly clumsyfashion of doin' a thing, that's the way they are always sure to githere. They're a benighted, obstinate, bull-headed people the English,that's the fact, and always was.' Well done, Jonathan--quitetrue!--_From a private Letter from Boston._JOHN BUNYAN AND MINCE-PIES.In No. 417 of this Journal it is chronicled that John Bunyan scrupledto eat mince-pies, because of the superstitious character popularlyattached to them; but it would appear from an anecdote sent to us by acorrespondent, that if this was true at all of the author of the_Pilgrim's Progress_, he must have received new light upon thesubject at a later period of life. When he was imprisoned forpreaching--so says the anecdote--in Bedford jail, a superstitiouslady, thinking to entrap him, sent a servant to request his acceptanceof a Christmas pie; whereupon Banyan replied: 'Tell your mistress thatI accept her present thankfully, for I have learned to distinguishbetween a mince-pie and superstition.'FOREST-TEACHINGS.    There was travelling in the wild-wood      Once, a child of song;    And he marked the forest-monarchs      As he went along.    Here, the oak, broad-eaved and spreading;      Here, the poplar tall;    Here, the holly, forky-leaved;    Here, the yew, for the bereaved;      Here, the chestnut, with its flowers, and its spine-bestudded ball.    Here, the cedar, palmy-branched;      Here, the hazel low;    Here, the aspen, quivering ever;      Here, the powdered sloe.    Wondrous was their form and fashion,      Passing beautiful to see    How the branches interlaced,    How the leaves each other chased,      Fluttering lightly hither, thither on the wind-aroused tree.    Then he spake to those wood-dwellers:      'Ye are like to men,    And I learn a lesson from ye      With my spirit's ken.    Like to us in low beginning,      Children of the patient earth;    Born, like us, to rise on high,    Ever nearer to the sky,      And, like us, by slow advances from the minute of your birth.    'And, like mortals, ye have uses--      Uses each his own:    Each his gift, and each his beauty,      Not to other known.    Thou, O oak, the strong ship-builder,      For thy country's good,    Givest up thy noble life,    Like a patriot in the strife,      Givest up thy heart of timber, as he poureth out his blood.    'Thou, O poplar, tall and taper,      Reachest up on high;    Like a preacher pointing upward--      Upward to the sky.    Thou, O holly, with thy berries,      Gleaming redly bright,    Comest, like a pleasant friend,    When the dying year hath end,      Comest to the Christmas party, round the ruddy fire-light.    'Thou, O yew, with sombre branches,      And dark-veiled head--    Like a monk within the church-yard,      When the prayers are said,    Standing by the newly-buried      In the depth of thought--    Tellest, with a solemn grace,    Of the earthly dwelling-place,      Of the soul to live for ever--of the body come to nought,    'Thou, O cedar, storm-enduring,      Bent with years, and old,    Standest with thy broad-eaved branches,      Shadowing o'er the mould;    Shadowing o'er the tender saplings,      Like a patriarch mild,    When he lifts his hoary head,    And his hands a blessing shed,      On the little ones around him--on the children of his child.    'And the light, smooth-barked hazel,      And the dusky sloe,    Are the poor men of the forest--      Are the weak and low.    Yet unto the poor is given      Power the earth to bless;    And the sloe's small fruit of down,    And the hazel's clusters brown,      Are the tribute they can offer--are their mite of usefulness.    'When the awful words were spoken,      "It is finished!"--    When the all-loving heart was broken,      Bowed the patient head;    When the earth grew dark as midnight      In her solemn awe--    Then the forest-branches all    Bent, with reverential fall--      Bent, as bent the Jewish foreheads at the giving of the law.    'But one tree was in the forest      That refused to bow;    Then a sudden blast came o'er it,      And a whisper low    Made the leaves and branches quiver--      Shook the guilty tree;    And the voice was: "Tremble ever      To eternity:    Be a lesson from thee read--    He that boweth not his head,      And obeyeth not his Maker, let him fear eternally!"    'So thou standest ever shaking,      Ever quivering with fear,    For the voice is still upon thee,      And the whisper near.    Like the guilty, conscience-haunted;      And the name for thee    Is, "The tree of many thoughts"--    Is, "The tree of many doubts;"      And thy leaves are thoughts and doubtings--for thou art the          sinner's tree.    'Thou, O chestnut, richly branched,      Standest in thy might,    Rising like a leafy tower      In the summer light.    And thy branches are fruit-laden,      Waving bold and free;    And the beams upon thee shed    Are like blessings on thy head:      Thou art strong, and fair, and fruitful--for thou art the good          man's tree.    'So, farewell, great forest-teachers:      There is a spirit dwells    In the veinings of each leaflet,      In each flower's cells:    Ye have each a voice and lesson,      And ye seem to say:    "Open, man, thine eyes to see    In each flower, stone, and tree,      Something pure and something holy, as thou passest on thy way."'

I havehad it pointed out, not altogether facetiously, that it is impossible todetermine with accuracy what one woman, much less what any number ofwomen, wants. I sympathize with the first half of the tradition. Thedesires, that is to say, the ideals, of an individual, man or woman, arenot always easy to determine. The individual is complex and exceedinglyprone to variation. The mass alone is consistent. The ideals of the massof women are wrapped in mystery simply because no one has cared enoughabout them to inquire what they are.Men, ardently, eternally, interested in Woman--one woman at a time--arealmost never even faintly interested in women. Strangely, deliberatelyignorant of women, they argue that their ignorance is justified by aninnate unknowableness of the sex.I am persuaded that the time is at hand when this sentimental, halfcontemptuous attitude of half the population towards the other half willhave to be abandoned. I believe that the time has arrived whenself-interest, if other motive be lacking, will compel society toexamine the ideals of women. In support of this opinion I ask you toconsider three facts, each one of which is so patent that it requires noargument.The Census of 1900 reported nearly six million women in the UnitedStates engaged in wage earning outside their homes. Between 1890 and1900 the number of women in industry increased faster than the number ofmen in industry. _It increased faster than the birth rate._ The numberof women wage earners at the present date can only be estimated. Ninemillion would be a conservative guess. Nine million women who haveforsaken the traditions of the hearth and are competing with men in theworld of paid labor, means that women are rapidly passing from thedomestic control of their fathers and their husbands. Surely this isthe most important economic fact in the world to-day.Within the past twenty years no less than nine hundred and fifty-fourthousand divorces have been granted in the United States. Two thirds ofthese divorces were granted to aggrieved wives. In spite of theanathemas of the church, in the face of tradition and early precept, indefiance of social ostracism, accepting, in the vast majority of cases,the responsibility of self support, more than six hundred thousandwomen, in the short space of twenty years, repudiated the burden ofuncongenial marriage. Without any doubt this is the most importantsocial fact we have had to face since the slavery question was settled.Not only in the United States, but in every constitutional country inthe world the movement towards admitting women to full politicalequality with men is gathering strength. In half a dozen countries womenare already completely enfranchised. In England the opposition isseeking terms of surrender. In the United States the stoutest enemy ofthe movement acknowledges that woman suffrage is ultimately inevitable.The voting strength of the world is about to be doubled, and the newelement is absolutely an unknown quantity. Does any one question thatthis is the most important political fact the modern world has everfaced?I have asked you to consider three facts, but in reality they are butthree manifestations of one fact, to my mind the most important humanfact society has yet encountered. Women have ceased to exist as asubsidiary class in the community. They are no longer wholly dependent,economically, intellectually, and spiritually, on a ruling class of men.They look on life with the eyes of reasoning adults, where once theyregarded it as trusting children. Women now form a new social group,separate, and to a degree homogeneous. Already they have evolved a groupopinion and a group ideal.And this brings me to my reason for believing that society will soon becompelled to make a serious survey of the opinions and ideals of women.As far as these have found collective expressions, it is evident thatthey differ very radically from accepted opinions and ideals of men. Asa matter of fact, it is inevitable that this should be so. Back of thedifferences between the masculine and the feminine ideal lie centuriesof different habits, different duties, different ambitions, differentopportunities, different rewards.I shall not here attempt to outline what the differences have been orwhy they have existed. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in _Women andEconomics_, did this before me,--did it so well that it need never bedone again. I merely wish to point out that different habits of actionnecessarily result, after long centuries, in different habits ofthought. Men, accustomed to habits of strife, pursuit of materialgains, immediate and tangible rewards, have come to believe that strifeis not only inevitable but desirable; that material gain and visiblereward are alone worth coveting. In this commercial age strife meansbusiness competition, reward means money. Man, in the aggregate, thinksin terms of money profit and money loss, and try as he will, he cannotyet think in any other terms.I have in mind a certain rich young man, who, when he is notsuperintending the work of his cotton mills in Virginia, is giving histime to settlement work in the city of Washington. The rich young man isdevoted to the settlement. One day he confided to a guest of the house,a social worker of note, that he wished he might dedicate his entirelife to philanthropy."There is much about a commercial career that is depressing to asympathetic nature," he declared. "For example, it constantly depressesme to observe the effect of the cotton mills on the girls in my employ.They come in from the country, fresh, blooming, and eager to work.Within a few months perhaps they are pale, anaemic, listless. Notinfrequently a young girl contracts tuberculosis and dies before onerealizes that she is ill. It wrings the heart to see it.""I suspect," said the visitor, "that there is something wrong with yourmills. Are you sure that they are sufficiently well ventilated?""They are as well ventilated as we can have them," said the rich youngman. "Of course we cannot keep the windows open.""Why not?" persisted the visitor."Because in our mills we spin both black and white yarn, and if thewindows were kept open the lint from the black yarn would blow on thewhite yarn and ruin it."A quick vision rose before the visitor's consciousness, of a mill room,noisy with clacking machinery, reeking with the mingled odors ofperspiration and warm oil, obscure with flying cotton flakes whichcovered the forms of the workers like snow and choked in their throatslike desert sand."But," she exclaimed, "you can have two rooms, one for the white yarnand the other for the black."The rich young man shook his head with the air of one who goes awayexceedingly sorrowful."No," he replied, "we can't. The business won't stand it."This story presents in miniature the social attitude of the majority ofmen. They cannot be held entirely responsible. Their minds automaticallyfunction just that way. They have high and generous impulses, theirhearts are susceptible to tenderest pity, they often possess the visionof brotherhood and human kinship, but habit, long habit, alwaysintervenes in time to save the business from loss of a few dollarsprofit.Three years ago Chicago was on the eve of one of its periodical "vicecrusades," of which more later. Sensational stories had been publishedin several newspapers, to the effect that no fewer than five thousandJewish girls were leading lives of shame in the city, a statement whichwas received with horror by the Jewish population of Chicago. A meetingof wealthy and influential men and women was called in the law libraryof a well known jurist and philanthropist. Representatives from varioussocial settlements in Jewish quarters of the town were invited, and itwas as a guest of one of these settlements that I was privileged to bepresent.Eloquent addresses were made and an elaborate plan for investigation andrelief was outlined. Finally it came to a point where ways and means hadto be considered. The presiding officer put this phase of the matter tothe conference with smiling frankness. "You must realize, ladies andgentlemen," he said, "that we have entered upon an extensive and, I amafraid, a very expensive campaign."At this a middle aged and notably dignified man arose and said withemotion trembling in his voice: "Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemenof the conference, this surely is no time for us to think of economy ofexpenditure. If the daughters of Israel are losing their ancient dowerof purity, the sons of Israel should be willing, nay, eager to ransomthem at any cost. Permit me, as a privileged honor which I value highly,to offer, as a contribution towards the preliminary expenses of thiscampaign, my check for ten thousand dollars."He sat down to that polite little murmur of applause which goes roundthe room, and I whispered to the head resident of the settlement ofwhich I was a guest, an inquiry as to the identity of the generousdonor."That gentleman," she whispered in reply, "is one of the owners of agreat mail order department store in Chicago." She sighed deeply, asshe added: "During the first week of the panic that store discharged,without warning, five hundred girls."These typical examples of the reasoning processes of men are offeredwithout the slightest rancor. They had to be given in order that thewoman's habit of thought might be explained with clearness.Women, since society became an organized body, have been engaged in therearing, as well as the bearing of children. They have made the home,they have cared for the sick, ministered to the aged, and given to thepoor. The universal destiny of the mass of women trained them to feedand clothe, to invent, manufacture, build, repair, contrive, conserve,economize. They lived lives of constant service, within the narrowconfines of a home. Their labor was given to those they loved, and thereward they looked for was purely a spiritual reward.A thousand generations of service, unpaid, loving, intimate, must haveleft the strongest kind of a mental habit in its wake. Women, when theyemerged from the seclusion of their homes and began to mingle in theworld procession, when they were thrown on their own financialresponsibility, found themselves willy nilly in the ranks of theproducers, the wage earners; when the enlightenment of education was nolonger denied them, when their responsibilities ceased to be entirelydomestic and became somewhat social, when, in a word, women began to_think_, they naturally thought in human terms. They couldn't havethought otherwise if they had tried.They might have learned, it is true. In certain circumstances womenmight have been persuaded to adopt the commercial habit of thought. Butthe circumstances were exactly propitious for the encouragement of theold-time woman habit of service. The modern thinking, planning,self-governing, educated woman came into a world which is losing faithin the commercial ideal, and is endeavoring to substitute in its place asocial ideal. She came into a generation which is reaching passionatehands towards democracy. She became one with a nation which is weary ofwars and hatreds, impatient with greed and privilege, sickened ofpoverty, disease, and social injustice. The modern, free-functioningwoman accepted without the slightest difficulty these new ideals ofdemocracy and social service. Where men could do little more thantheorize in these matters, women were able easily and effectively toact.I hope that I shall not be suspected of ascribing to women any ingrainedor fundamental moral superiority to men. Women are not better than men.The mantle of moral superiority forced upon them as a substitute forintellectual equality they accepted, because they could not helpthemselves. They dropped it as soon as the substitute was no longernecessary.That the mass of women are invariably found on the side of the newideals is no evidence of their moral superiority to men; it is merelyevidence of their intellectual youth.Visitors from western cities and towns are often amazed, and vastlyamused, to find in New York and other eastern cities little narrow-gaugestreet car lines, where gaunt horses haul the shabbiest of cars over theoldest and roughest of road beds. The Westerner declares that nowhere inthe East does he find surface cars that equal in comfort and elegancethe cars recently installed in his Michigan or Nebraska or Washingtonhome town."Recently installed." There you have it.The eastern city retains its horse cars and its out-of-date electricrolling stock because it has them, and because there are all sorts ofdifficulties in the way of replacing them. Old franchises have to expireor otherwise be got rid of; corporations have to be coaxed or coerced;greed and corruption often have to be overcome; huge sums of money haveto be appropriated; a whole machinery of municipal government has to beset in motion before the old and established city can change itstraction system.The new western town goes on foot until it attains to a certain size anda sufficient prosperity. Then it installs electric railways, and ofcourse it purchases the newest and most modern of the available models.New social ideals are difficult for men to acquire in a practical waybecause their minds are filled with old traditions, inherited memories,outworn theories of law, government, and social control. They cannot getrid of these at once. They have used them so long, have found them soconvenient, so satisfactory, that even when you show them somethingadmittedly better; they are able only partially to comprehend and toaccept.Women, on the other hand, have very few antiques to get rid of. Untilrecently their minds, scantily furnished with a few personal preferencesand personal prejudices, were entirely bare of community ideals or anysocial theory. When they found themselves in need of a social theory itwas only natural that they should choose the most modern, the mostprogressive, the most idealistic. They made their choice unconsciously,and they began the application of their new-found theory almostautomatically. The machinery they employed was the long derided,misconceived, and unappreciated Women's Club.CHAPTER IIFROM CULTURE CLUBS TO SOCIAL SERVICEUnless you have lived in a live town in the Middle West--say inMichigan, or Indiana, or Nebraska--you cannot have a very adequate ideaof how ugly, and dirty, and neglected, and disreputable a town can bewhen nobody loves it. The railway station is a long, low, rakish thingof boards, painted a muddy maroon color. Around it is a stretch of bareground strewn with ashes. Beyond lies the main street, with some goodbusiness blocks,--a First National Bank in imposing granite, and aMasonic Temple in pressed brick. The high school occupies a treeless,grassless, windswept block by itself.In the center of the residential section of the town is a big,unsightly, hummocky vacant place, vaguely known as the park--or theplace where they are going to have a park, when the city gets around toit. At present it is a convenient spot wherein to dump tin cans, emptybottles, broken crockery, old shoes, and other residue. When the windblows, in the spring and fall, a fine assortment of desiccated rubbishis wafted up and down, and into the neighbors' dooryards.Everybody is busy in these live towns. Everybody is prosperous, andpatriotic, and law-abiding, and respectable. The business of "gettingon" absorbs the entire time and attention of the men. They "get on" sowell, for the most part, that their wives have plenty of leisure ontheir hands, and the latter occupy a portion of their leisure bybelonging to a club, organized for the study of the art of theRenaissance, Chinese religions before Confucius, or the mystery ofBrowning. The club meets every second Wednesday, and the members readpapers, after which there is tea and a social hour. The papers vary indegree alone, as the writer happens to be a skimmer, a wader, or adeep-sea diver in standard editions of the encyclopedias. The socialhour, however, occasionally develops in a direction quite away from therealms of pure culture.Such a town, with such a woman's club, was Lake City, Minnesota, a fewyears ago. Lake City had a busy and a prosperous male population, awoman's club bent on intellectual uplift, and a place where there wasgoing to be a park. One windy second Wednesday the club members arrivedwith their eyes full of dust, soot on their white gloves, andindignation in their hearts. When tea and the social hour came aroundculture went by the board and the conversation turned to the perfectlydisgraceful way in which the town's street cleaning was conducted."The streets are bad enough," said one member, "but, after all, oneexpects the streets to be dusty. What I object to is having a citydump-heap at my front door. Have any of you crossed my corner of thepark since the snow melted?"She drew a lively picture of a state of things gravely menacing to thehealth of her neighborhood, and that of all the people whose homes facedthe neglected square."Why doesn't somebody complain to the authorities?" she concluded. "Whydon't we do something about it? The next time we meet we might at leastadopt resolutions, or, better still, have a committee appointed. What doyou think, Madam President?"Madam President tapped her teaspoon on the edge of her empty cup. "Ithink," she said, "that we will come to order and do it now. Will youput what you have just suggested in the form of a motion?"At the next meeting of the club the committee to investigate the parkmade its report. The club members began a lively canvass among realestate owners and business men, and before long an astonished citycouncil found itself on its feet, receiving a deputation from thewoman's club. The women came armed with a donation of fifteen hundreddollars cash, and a polite, but firm, demand that the money be used toclean up and plant the park.The council replied that it had always intended to get around to thatpark, and would have done it long ago but for the fact that there was nopark board in existence, and could not be one, because the Solons whodrew up the city charter had forgotten to put in a provision for such aboard.The club held more meetings, and appointed more committees. One ofthese unearthed a State law which seemed to cover the case, and make apark board possible without the direct assistance of a city charter. Thecity attorney was visited, and somehow was coaxed, or argued, or bulliedinto giving a favorable opinion, after which the election of a parkboard followed as a matter of course. The town suddenly becameinterested in the park. The club women's fifteen hundred dollars wasdoubled by popular subscription, and the work of turning a town rubbishheap into a cool and shady garden spot was brief but durable.You wouldn't know the Lake City of those years if you saw it to-day.They have an attractive railroad station, paved streets, cementsidewalks, public playgrounds for children, a high school set in ashaded square, and residence streets that look like parkways. And thewoman's club was the parent of them all.There is a theory which expresses itself somewhat obviously in thephrase: "Whatever all the women of the country want they will get." Thetheory is a convenient one, because it may be used to defer action onany suggested reform, and it is harmless because of the seemingimpossibility of ascertaining what all the women of the country reallywant. The women of the United States and the women of all the world havediscovered a means through which they may express their collectiveopinions and desires: organization, and more organization. Lake City isbut one instance in a thousand.When American women began, a generation ago, to form themselves intoclubs, and later to join these clubs into state federations of clubs,and finally the state federations into a national body, they did notdream that they were going to express a collective opinion. Indeed, atthat time not very many had opinions worth expressing. The immediateneed of women's souls at the beginning of the club movement was foreducation; the higher education they missed by not going to college, andthey formed their clubs with the sole object of self-culture.The study period did not last very long. In fact it was doomed from thebeginning, for it is not in the nature of women, or at least it is notin the habit of women, to do things for themselves alone. They have_served_ for so many generations that they have learned to like servingbetter than anything else in the world, and they add service to thepursuit of culture, just as some of them add the important postscript tothe unimportant letter.Thus Dallas, Texas, had a women's club of the culture caste. One springday, after the star member had read a paper on the "Lake Poets," andanother member had rendered a Chopin _etude_ on the piano, they began totalk about the stegomyia mosquito, and what a pity it was that theannual danger of contagion and death from the bite of that insect had tobe faced all over again. Pools of water all over town, simply swarmingwith little wriggling things, soon to emerge as full-armed stegomyias,merely because the city authorities hadn't the money, or said theyhadn't, to cover the pools with oil."Why, oil isn't very expensive," said one of the club women. "Let's buya whole lot of it and do the work ourselves."So the work of saving hundreds of lives every year was added to thestudy of "Lake Poets" and Chopin by the Women's Club of Dallas. Themembers mapped the city, laid it out in districts, organized theirforces, bought oil and oil-cans and set forth. They visited the schools,got teachers and pupils interested, and secured their co-operation. Thestudy of city sanitation was soon put into the school curriculum, andoiling pools of standing water in every quarter of the town is now aregular part of the school program in the upper grades. Every year theclub women renew the agitation, and every year the school children goout with their teachers and cover the pools with oil.That story could be paralleled in almost any city in the United States.Clubs everywhere organized for the intellectual advancement of themembers, for the culture of music, art, and crafts, soon added to theoriginal object a department of philanthropy, a department of publicschool decoration, a department of child labor, a department of civics.The day a women's club adopts civics as a side line to literature, thatday it ceases to be a private association and becomes a publicinstitution--and the public sometimes finds this out before the clubsuspects it.An Eastern woman was visiting in San Francisco a short time before thefire. In the complication of three streets with names almost identical,she lost her way to the reception whither she was bound. The conductoron the last car she tried before going home was deeply sympathetic."'Tis a shame, ma'am, them streets," he declared. "I've always saidthere was no sense at all in havin' them named like that. A stranger isbound to go wrong. I'll tell you what you do, ma'am: you go straight toMrs. Lovell White, she that bosses the women's clubs, you know, ma'am.You tell her about them streets, and she'll have 'em changed."The conductor's simple faith in the Women's Club of San Francisco didnot lack justification. In the intervals of studying Browning andantique art, the club found time to discover to San Francisco all sortsof things that the city wanted and needed without knowing that it did."We ought to have a flower market," pronounced the club."Nonsense," said the City Council. "Besides, where is the money to comefrom?""We'll establish the flower market and show you," returned the club.They did. They found a centrally located square, the place where peoplewould be likely to go for an early morning sale of potted plants and cutflowers. Prices are moderate in outdoor markets, and nothing else sostimulates in an entire community the gardening instinct, usuallyconfined to a few individuals. The city authorities discovered that theflower market filled a long-felt want. So the city took the market over.These activities were more or less local. Others, begun as localaffairs, ultimately became national in scope. The movement which hasresulted in a national program in favor of public playgrounds forchildren began as a women's club movement. For a dozen years before thePlaygrounds Association of America came into existence, women's clubsall over the country had been establishing playgrounds, supporting themout of their club treasuries, and using every power of persuasion toeducate boards of education and city councils in their favor.Pittsburg affords a typical instance. In 1896 there was a Civic Club ofAllegheny County, composed of women of the twin steel cities ofPittsburg and Allegheny. At the head of its Education Department therewas a woman, Miss Beulah Kennard, who loved children; not beautifullyclean, well behaved, curled and polished children, but just children.Children attracted Miss Kennard to such a degree that she couldn't bearthe sight of them wallowing in the grime and soot of Pittsburg streetsand alleys. Often she stopped in her walks to watch them, dodging wagonsand automobiles; throwing stones, tossing balls, fighting, and shootingcraps; stealing apples from push-carts, getting arrested and beingdragged through the farce of a trial at law for the crime of playing."Those children," Miss Kennard told her club, "have got to have adecent place to play this summer." And the club agreed with her. Thetreasury yielded for a beginning the modest sum of one hundred andtwenty-five dollars, and with this money the women fitted out oneschoolyard, large enough for sixty children to play in. There was notrouble about getting the sixty together. They came, a noisy, joyous,turbulent, vacation set of children, and the anxious committee from theclub looked at them in great trepidation of spirit and said to oneanother: "What on earth are we going to do with them, now that we've gotthem here?"With hardly a ghost of precedent to guide them, the club undertook thework, and as women have had considerable experience in taking care ofchildren at home, they soon discovered ways of taking care of themsuccessfully in the playground.The next summer the Civic Club invested six hundred dollars inplaygrounds. Two schoolyards were fitted up in Pittsburg and two inAllegheny. After that, every summer, the work was extended. More moneyeach year was voted, and additional playgrounds were established. In thesummer of 1899, three years after the first experiment, Pittsburgchildren had nine playgrounds and Allegheny children had three, allgifts of the women. By another year the committee was handling thousandsof dollars and managing an enterprise of considerable magnitude. Alsotheir work was attracting the admiration of other club women, who askedfor an opportunity to co-operate. In 1900 practically all the clubs ofthe two cities united, and formed a joint committee of the Women's Clubsof Pittsburg and vicinity to take charge of playgrounds.[Illustration: CARPENTER SHOP, VACATION SCHOOL, PITTSBURGH. Establishedby club women and for years supported by them.]All this time the work was entirely in the hands of the club women, whobought the apparatus, organized the games, employed the trainedsupervisors, and supplied from their own membership the volunteerworkers, without whom the enterprise would have been a failure from thestart. The Board of Education co-operated to the extent of lendingschoolyards. Finally the Board of Education decided to vote an annualcontribution of money.In 1902 the city of Pittsburg woke up and gave the women fifteenhundred dollars, with which they established one more playground and arecreation park. The original one hundred and twenty-five dollars hadnow expanded to nearly eight thousand dollars, and Pittsburg andAllegheny children were not only playing in a dozen schoolyards, butthey were attending vacation schools, under expert instructors in manualtraining, cooking, sewing, art-crafts. Several recreation centers,all-the-year-round playgrounds, have been added since then. ForPittsburg has adopted the women's point of view in the matter ofplaygrounds. This year the city voted fifty thousand, three hundred andfifty dollars, and the Board of Education appropriated ten thousanddollars for the vacation schools.In Detroit it was the Twentieth Century Club that began the playgroundagitation. Mrs. Clara B. Arthur, some ten years ago, read a paperbefore the Department of Philanthropy and Reform, and following it thechairman of the meeting appointed a committee to consider thepossibility of playgrounds for Detroit children. The committee visitedthe Board of Education, explained the need of playgrounds, and askedthat the Board conduct one trial playground in a schoolyard, during theapproaching vacation. The Board declined. The boards of education inmost cities declined at first.The club did not give up. It talked playgrounds to the other clubs,until all the organizations of women were interested. Within a year ortwo Detroit had a Council of Women, with a committee on playgrounds. Thecommittee went to the Common Council this time and asked permission toerect a pavilion and establish a playground on a piece of city land.This was a great, bare, neglected spot, the site of an abandonedreservoir which had been of no use to anybody for twenty years. Theplace had the advantage of being in a very forlorn neighborhood wheremany children swarmed.The Common Council was mildly amused at the idea of putting publicproperty to such an absurd, such an unheard-of use. A few of the menwere indignant. One Germanic alderman exploded wrathfully: "Vot doesvimmens know about poys' play?--No!" And that settled it.The committee went to the Board of Education once more, this time withbetter success. They received permission to open and conduct, during thelong vacation, one playground in a large schoolyard. For two summers thewomen maintained that playground, holding their faith against theopposition of the janitors, the jeers of the newspapers, and theconstant hostility of tax-payers, who protested against the "ruin ofschool property." After two years the Board of Education took over thework. The mayor became personally interested, and the Common Councilgracefully surrendered. They have plenty of playgrounds in Detroit now,the latest development being winter sports.If the Germanic alderman who protested that "vimmins" did not knowanything about boys' play was in office at the time, one wonders whathis emotions were when the playgrounds committee first appeared beforethe Council and asked to have vacant lots flooded to give childrenskating ponds in winter. Of course the Council refused. Fire plugs werefor water in case of fire, not for children's enjoyment. In fact therewas a city ordinance forbidding the opening of a fire plug in winter,except to extinguish fire. It took two years of constant work on thepart of the club women to remove that ordinance, but they did it, andthe children of Detroit have their winter as well as their summerplaygrounds.[Illustration: CAPTAIN BALL ON GIRL'S FIELD, WASHINGTON PARK,PITTSBURGH. Out of the persistent work of club women more than threehundred playgrounds for children have been established.]In Philadelphia are fourteen splendid playgrounds and vacation schools,established in the beginning and maintained for many years by a civicclub of women, the largest women's civic club in the country. Theprocess of educating public opinion in their favor was slow, for it isdifficult to make men see that the children of a modern city havedifferent needs from the country or village children of a generationago. Men remember their own boyhood, and scoff at the idea of organizedand supervised play in a made playground. Women have no memories of theold swimming-hole. They simply see the conditions before them, and theyinstinctively know what must be done to meet them. The process ofeducating the others is slow, but this year in Philadelphia sixty publicschoolyards were opened for public playgrounds, and the cityappropriated five thousand dollars towards their maintenance. In ahundred cities East and West the women's clubs have been the originalmovers or have co-operated in the playground movement.Out of this persistent work was born the Playground Association ofAmerica, an organization of men and women, which in the three years ofits existence has established more than three hundred playgrounds forchildren. In Massachusetts they have secured a referendum providing thatall cities of over ten thousand inhabitants shall vote upon the questionof providing adequate playgrounds. The act provides that every city andtown in the Commonwealth which accepts the act shall after July 1, 1910,provide and maintain at least one public playground, and at least oneother playground for every additional twenty thousand inhabitants.Something like twenty-five cities in the State have accepted theplaygrounds act. It is a good beginning. The slogan of the movement,"The boy without a playground is the father of the man without a job,"has swept over the continent.[Illustration: STORY HOUR AT VACATION PLAYGROUND, CASTELAR SCHOOL YARD,LOS ANGELES, CAL.]This surely is a not inconsiderable achievement for so humble aninstrument as women's clubs. It is true that in most communities theyhave forgotten that the women's clubs ever had anything to do with themovement. The Playgrounds Association has not forgotten, however. Itspresident, Luther Halsey Gulick, of New York, declares that even now thework would languish if it lost the co-operation of the women's clubs.The scope of woman's work for civic betterment is wider than theinterests that directly affect children. How much the women attempt, howdifficult they find their task, how much opposition they encounter, andhow certain their success in the end, is indicated in a modest report ofthe Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Women's Civic Club. That report says inpart:"It is no longer necessary for us to continue, at our own cost, thepractical experiment we began in street-cleaning, or to advocate thepaving of a single principal street, as a test of the value of improvedhighways; nor is it necessary longer to strive for a pure water supply,a healthier sewerage system, or the construction of playgrounds. _Thiswork is now being done by the City Council, by the Board of PublicWorks, and by the Park Commission._"Not that the Harrisburg Women's Civic Club has gone out of business. Itstill keeps fairly busy with schoolhouse decoration, traveling librariesfor factory employees, and inspecting the city dump.In Birmingham, Alabama, the women's work has been recognized officially.The club Women have formed "block" clubs, composed of the women livingin each block, and the mayor has invested them with powers ofsupervision, control of street cleaning, and disposal of waste andgarbage. They really act as overseers, and can remove lazy andincompetent employees.Carlisle, Pennsylvania, has a ten-year-old Civic Club. The women havesucceeded in getting objectionable billboards removed, public dumpsremoved from the town, in having all outside market stalls covered, andhave secured ordinances forbidding spitting in public places, andagainst throwing litter into the streets.Cranford, New Jersey, is one of a dozen small cities where the women'sclubs hold regular town house-cleanings. One large town in the MiddleWest adopted a vigorous method of educating public opinion in favor ofspring and fall municipal house-cleaning. The club women got aphotographer and went the rounds of streets and alleys and privatebackyards. Wherever bad or neglected conditions were found the club senta note to the owner of the property asking him to co-operate with itsmembers in cleaning up and beautifying the town. Where no attention waspaid to the notes, the photographs were posted conspicuously in theclub's public exhibit.If the California women saved the big tree grove, the New Jersey women,by years of persistent work, saved the Palisades of the Hudson fromdestruction and inaugurated the movement to turn them into a publicpark. As for the Colorado club women, they saved the Cliff Dwellers'remains. You can no longer buy the pottery and other priceless relics ofthose prehistoric people in the curio-shops of Denver.I am not attempting a catalogue; I am only giving a few crucialinstances. The activities of women if they appeared only sporadically inLake City, Dallas, San Francisco, and a dozen other cities, would notnecessarily carry much weight. They would possess an interest purelylocal. But the club women of Lake City, Dallas, San Francisco, do notkeep their interests local. Once a year they travel, hundreds of them,to a chosen city in the State, and there they hold a convention whichlasts a week. And every second year the club women of Minnesota andTexas and California, and every other State in the Union, to saynothing of Alaska, Porto Rico, and the Canal Zone, thousands of them,journey to a chosen center, and there they hold a convention which lastsa week. And at these state and national conventions the club womencompare their work and criticise it, and confer on public questions, anddecide which movements they shall promote. They summon experts in alllines of work to lecture and advise. Increasingly their work is nationalin its scope.In round numbers, eight hundred thousand women are now enrolled in theclubs belonging to the General Federation of Women's Clubs, holding incommon certain definite opinions, and working harmoniously towardscertain definite social ends. Remember that these eight hundredthousand women are the educated, intelligent, socially powerful.Long ago these eight hundred thousand women ceased to confine theirstudies to printed pages. They began to study life. Leaders developed,women of intellect and experience, who could foresee the immense poweran organized womanhood might some time wield, and who had courage todirect the forces under them towards vital objects.When, in 1904, Mrs. Sarah Platt Decker, of Denver, was elected Presidentof the General Federation, she found a number of old-fashioned clubsstill devoting themselves to Shakespeare and the classic writers. Mrs.Decker, a voter, a full citizen, and a public worker of prominence inher State, simply laughed the musty study clubs out of existence."Ladies," she said to the delegates at the biennial meeting of 1904,"Dante is dead. He died several centuries ago, and a great many thingshave happened since his time. Let us drop the study of his 'Inferno' andproceed in earnest to contemplate our own social order."[Illustration: MRS. SARAH PLATT DECKER]Mostly they took her advice. A few clubs still devote themselves to thepursuit of pure culture, a few others exist with little motive beyondcongenial association. The great majority of women's clubs are organizedfor social service. A glance at their national program shows themodernity, the liberal character of organized women's ideals. TheGeneral Federation has twelve committees, among them being those onIndustrial Conditions of Women and Children, Civil Service Reform,Forestry, Pure Food and Public Health, Education, Civics, Legislation,Arts and Crafts, and Household Economics. Every state federation hasadopted, in the main, the same departments; and the individual clubsfollow as many lines of the work as their strength warrants.The contribution of the women's clubs to education has been enormous.There is hardly a State in the Union the public schools of which havenot been beautified, inside and outside; hardly a State wherekindergartens and manual training, domestic science, medical inspection,stamp savings banks, or other improvements have not been introduced bythe clubs. In almost every case the clubs have purchased the equipmentand paid the salaries until the boards of education and the schoolsuperintendents have been convinced of the value of the innovations. Inthe South, where opportunities for the higher education of women arerestricted, the clubs support dozens of scholarships in colleges andinstitutes. Many western State federations, notable among which is thatof Colorado, have strong committees on education which are active in theentire school system.Thomas M. Balliett, Dean of Pedagogy in the New York University, paid adeserved tribute to the Massachusetts club women when he said:     In Massachusetts the various women's organizations have, within the     past few years, made a study of schools and school conditions     throughout the State with a thoroughness that has never been     attempted before.Dean Balliett says of women's clubs in general that the mostimportant reform movements in elementary education within the pasttwenty years have been due, in large measure, to the efforts oforganized women. And he is right.The women's clubs have founded more libraries than Mr. Carnegie. Earlyin the movement the women began the circulation among the clubs oftraveling reference libraries. Soon this work was extended, but theobject of the libraries was diverted. Instead of collections of books onspecial subjects to assist the club women in their studies, thetraveling cases were arranged in miscellaneous groups, and were sent toschools, to factories, to lonely farms, mining camps, lumber camps, andto isolated towns and villages.Iowa now has more than twelve thousand volumes, half of them referencebooks, in circulation. Eighty-one permanent libraries have grown out ofthe traveling libraries in Iowa alone. After the traveling cases havebeen coming to a town for a year or two, people wake up and agree thatthey want a permanent place in which to read and study. Ohio has over athousand libraries in circulation, having succeeded, a few years ago, ingetting a substantial appropriation from the legislature to supplementtheir work. Western States--Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho--have suppliedreading matter to ranches and mining camps for many years.One interesting special library is circulated in Massachusetts and RhodeIsland in behalf of the anti-tuberculosis movement. Something like fortyof the best books on health, and on the prevention and cure oftuberculosis, are included. This library, with a pretty completetuberculosis exhibit, is sent around, and is shown by the local clubsof each town. Usually the women try to have a mass-meeting, at whichlocal health problems are discussed. The Health Department of theGeneral Federation is working to establish these health libraries andexhibits in every State.Not only in the United States, but in every civilized country, havewomen associated themselves together with the object of reforming whatseems to them social chaos. In practically every civilized country inthe world to-day there exists a Council of Women, a central organizationto which clubs and societies of women with all sorts of opinions andobjects send delegates. In the United States the council is made up ofthe General Federation of Women's Clubs, the Woman's ChristianTemperance Union, and innumerable smaller organizations, like theNational Congress of Mothers, and the Daughters of the AmericanRevolution. More than a million and a half American women areaffiliated.Four hundred and twenty-six women's organizations belong to the councilin Great Britain. In Switzerland the council has sixty-four alliedsocieties; in Austria it has fifty; in the Netherlands it hasthirty-five. Seventy-five thousand women belong to the French council.In all, the International Council of Women, to which all the councilssend delegates, represents more than eight million women, in countriesas far apart as Australia, Argentine, Iceland, Persia, South Africa, andevery country in Europe. The council, indeed, has no formal organizationin Russia, because organizations of every kind are illegal in Russia.But Russian women attend every meeting of the International Council.Turkish women sent word to the last meeting that they hoped soon to askfor admission. The President of the International Council of Women isthe Countess of Aberdeen. Titled women in every European country belongto their councils. The Queen of Greece is president of the Greekcouncil.The object of this great world organization of women is to provide acommon center for women of every country, race, creed, or party who areassociating themselves together in altruistic work. Once every fiveyears the International Council holds a great world congress of women.What eight million of the most intelligent, the most thoughtful, themost altruistic women in the world believe, what they think the worldneeds, what they wish and desire for the good of humanity, must be ofinterest. It must count.[Illustration: LADY ABERDEEN President of the International Council ofWomen.]The International Council of Women discusses every important questionpresented, but makes no decision until the opinion of the delegates ispractically unanimous. It commits itself to no opinion, lends itself tono movement, until the movement has passed the controversial stage.Those who cling to the old notion that women are perpetually at war withone another will learn with astonishment that eight million women of allnationalities, religions, and temperaments are agreed on at least fourquestions. In the course of its twenty years of existence theInternational Council has agreed to support four movements: Peace andarbitration, social purity, removing legal disabilities of women, womansuffrage.The American reader will be inclined to cavil at the last-mentionedobject. Woman suffrage, it will be claimed, has not passed thecontroversial stage, even with women themselves. That is true in theUnited States and in England. It is true, in a sense, in most countriesof the world. But in European countries not _woman_ suffrage, but_universal_ suffrage is being struggled for.I had this explained to me in Russia, in the course of a conversationwith Alexis Aladyn, the brilliant leader of the Social Democratic party.I said to him that I had been informed that the conservative reformers,as well as the radicals, included woman suffrage in their programs.Aladyn looked puzzled for a moment, and then he replied: "All partiesdesire universal suffrage. Naturally that includes women."Finland at that time, 1906, had recently won its independence from theautocracy and was preparing for its first general election. Talking withone of the nineteen women returned to Parliament a few months later, Iasked: "How did you Finnish women persuade the makers of the newconstitution to give you the franchise?""Persuade?" she repeated; "we did not have to persuade them. There wassimply no opposition. One of the demands made on the Russian Governmentwas for universal suffrage."The movement for universal suffrage, that is the movement for freegovernment, with the consent of the governed, is considered by theInternational Council of Women to have passed the controversial stage.The whole club movement, as a matter of fact, is a part of the greatdemocratic movement which is sweeping over the whole world. Individualclubs may be exclusive, even aristocratic in their tendencies, but thelarge organization is absolutely democratic. If the President of theInternational Council is an English peeress, one of the vice-presidentsis the wife of a German music teacher, and one of the secretaries is aself-supporting woman. The General Federation in the United States ismade up of women of various stations in life, from millionaires' wivesto factory girls.The democracy of women's organizations was shown at the meeting inLondon a year ago of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, wheredelegates from twenty-one countries assembled. One of the great featuresof the meeting was a wonderful pageant of women's trades andprofessions. An immense procession of women, bearing banners and emblemsof their work, marched through streets lined with spectators to AlbertHall, where the entire orchestra of this largest auditorium in the worldwas reserved for them. A published account of the pageant, afterdescribing the delegations of teachers, nurses, doctors, journalists,artists, authors, house workers, factory women, stenographers, andothers well known here, says:     Then the ranks opened, and down the long aisle came the chain     makers who work at the forge, and the pit-brow women from the     mines,--women whose faces have been blackened by smoke and coal     dust until they can never be washed white.... To these women, the     hardest workers in the land, were given the seats of honor, while     behind them, gladly taking a subordinate place, were many women     wearing gowns with scarlet and purple hoods, indicating their     university degrees.Every public movement--reform, philanthropic, sanitary, educational--nowasks the co-operation of women's organizations. The United StatesGovernment asked the co-operation of the women's clubs to save theprecarious Panama situation. At a moment when social discontentthreatened literally to stop the building of the canal, the Departmentof Commerce and Labor employed Miss Helen Varick Boswell, of New York,to go to the Isthmus and organize the wives and daughters of Governmentemployees into clubs. The Department knew that the clubs, onceorganized, would do the rest. Nor was it disappointed.The Government asks the co-operation of women in its latest work ofconserving natural resources. At the biennial of the Federation ofWomen's Clubs in 1906 Mr. Enos Mills delivered an address on forestry, amovement which was beginning to engage the attention of the clubs.Within an hour after he left the platform Mr. Mills had been engaged bya dozen state presidents to lecture to clubs and federations. As soonas it reached the Government that the women's clubs were paying fiftydollars a lecture to learn about forestry work, the Government arrangedthat the clubs should have the best authorities in the nation to lectureon forestry free of all expense.But the Government is not alone in recognizing the power of women'sorganizations. If the Government approves their interest in publicquestions, vested interests are beginning to fear it. The president ofthe Manufacturers' Association, in his inaugural address, told hiscolleagues that their wives and daughters invited some very dangerousand revolutionary speakers to address their clubs. He warned them thatthe women were becoming too friendly toward reforms that the associationfrowned upon.This is indeed true, and women display, in their new-found enthusiasm,a singularly obstinate spirit. All the legislatures south of the Masonand Dixon Line cannot make the Southern women believe that Southernprosperity is dependent upon young children laboring in mills. The womengo on working for child labor and compulsory education laws, unconvincedby the arguments of the mill owners and the votes of the legislators.The highest court in the State of New York was powerless to persuade NewYork club women that the United States Constitution stands in the way ofa law prohibiting the night work of women. The Court of Appeals declaredthe law unconstitutional, and many women at present are toiling atnight. But the club women immediately began fighting for a new law.The women of every State in the Union are able to work harmoniouslytogether because they are unhampered with traditions of what thefounders of the Republic intended,--the sacredness of state rights, orthe protective paternalism of Wall Street. The gloriously illogicalsincerity of women is concerned only about the thing itself.I have left for future consideration women who having definite socialtheories have organized themselves for definite objects. This chapterhas purposely been confined to the activities of average women--goodwives and mothers, the eight hundred thousand American women whosecollective opinion is expressed through the General Federation ofWomen's Clubs. For the most part they are mature in years, these clubwomen. Their children are grown. Some are in college and some aremarried. I have heard more than one presiding officer at a StateFederation meeting proudly announce from the platform that she hadbecome a grandmother since the last convention.The present president of the General Federation, Mrs. Philip N. Mooreof St. Louis, Missouri, is a graduate of Vassar College, and served fora time as president of the National Society of Collegiate Alumnae. Thereare not wanting in the club movement many women who have taken collegeand university honors. Club women taken the country over, however, arenot college products. If they had been, the club movement might havetaken on a more cultural and a less practical form. As it was, the womenformed their groups with the direct object of educating themselves and,being practical women used to work, they readily turned their newknowledge to practical ends. As quickly as they found out, througheducation, what their local communities needed they were filled with agenerous desire to supply those needs. In reality they simply learnedfrom books and study how to apply their housekeeping lore to municipalgovernment and the public school system. Nine-tenths of the work theyhave undertaken relates to children, the school, and the home. Some ofit seemed radical in the beginning, but none of it has failed, in thelong run, to win the warmest approval of the people.The eight million women who form the International Council of Women, andexpress the collective opinion of women the world over, are notexceptional types, although they may possess exceptional intelligence.They are merely good citizens, wives, and mothers. Their programcontains nothing especially radical. And yet, what a revolution wouldthe world witness were that program carried out? Peace and arbitration;social purity; public health; woman suffrage; removal of all legaldisabilities of women. This last-named object is perhaps morerevolutionary in its character than the others, because its fulfillmentwill disturb the basic theories on which the nations have establishedtheir different forms of government.CHAPTER IIIEUROPEAN WOMEN AND THE SALIC LAWSeveral years ago a woman of wealth and social prominence in Kentucky,after pondering some time on the inferior position of women in theUnited States, wrote a book. In this volume the United States wascompared most unfavorably with the countries of Europe, where thedignity and importance of women received some measure of recognition.Women, this author protested, enjoy a larger measure of political powerin England than in America. In England and throughout Europe theirsocial power is greater. If a man becomes lord mayor of an English cityhis wife becomes lady mayoress, and she shares all her husband'sofficial honors. On the Continent women are often made honorary colonelsof regiments, and take part with the men in military reviews. Womenfrequently hold high offices at court, acting as chamberlains,constables, and the like. The writer closed her last chapter with theannouncement that she meant henceforth to make her home in England,where women had more than once occupied the throne as absolute monarchand constitutional ruler.It is true that in some particulars American women do seem to be at adisadvantage with European women. With what looks like a higher regardfor women's intelligence, England has bestowed upon them every measureof suffrage except the Parliamentary franchise. In England, throughoutthe Middle Ages, and even down to the present century, women held theoffice of sheriff of the county, clerk of the crown, high constable,chamberlain, and even champion at a coronation,--the champion being apicturesque figure who rides into the hall and flings his glove to thenobles, in defense of the king's crown.In the royal pageants of European history behold the powerful figures ofMaria Theresa, Catherine the Great, Mary Tudor, Elizabeth, Mary ofScotland, Christina of Sweden, rulers in fact as well as in name; to saynothing of the long line of women regents in whose hands the stateintrusted its affairs, during the minority of its kings. In the UnitedStates a woman candidate for mayor of a small town would be considereda joke.These and other inconsistencies have puzzled many ardent upholders ofAmerican chivalry. In order to understand the position of women in theUnited States it is necessary to make a brief survey of the laws underwhich European women are governed, and the social theory on which theirapparent advantages are based.In the first place, the statement that in European countries a woman maysucceed to the throne must be qualified. In three countries only,England, Spain, and Portugal, are women counted in the line ofsuccession on terms approaching equality with men. In these threecountries when a monarch dies leaving no sons his eldest daughterbecomes the sovereign. If the ruling monarch die, leaving no children atall, the oldest daughter--failing sons--of the man who was in hislifetime in direct line of succession is given preference to male heirsmore remote. Thus Queen Victoria succeeded William IV, she being theonly child of the late king's deceased brother and heir, the Duke ofKent.Similar laws govern the succession in Portugal and Spain, althoughdispute on this point has more than once caused civil war in Spain.In Holland, Greece, Russia, Austria, and a few German states a woman maysucceed to the throne, provided every single male heir to the crown isdead. Queen Wilhelmina became sovereign in Holland only because theHouse of Orange was extinct in the male line, and Holland lost, onaccount of the accession of Wilhelmina, the rich and important Duchy ofLuxemburg.Luxemburg, in common with the rest of Europe, except the countriesdescribed, lives under what is known as the Salic Law, according towhich a woman may not, in any circumstances, become sovereign.A word about this Salic Law is necessary, because the tradition of itpermeates the whole atmosphere in which the women of Europe live, move,and have their legal and social being.The Salic Law was the code of a barbarous people, so far extinct andforgotten that it is uncertain just what territory in ancient Gaul theyoccupied at the time the code was formulated. Later the Salian Franks,as the tribe was designated, built on the left bank of the Seine rudefortresses and a collection of wattled huts which became the ancestor ofthe present-day city of Paris.The Salic Law was a complete code. It governed all matters, civil andmilitary. It prescribed rules of war; it fixed the salaries ofofficials; it designated the exact amount of blood money the family of aslain man might collect from the family of the slayer; it regu latedconditions under which individuals might travel from one village toanother; it governed matters of property transfer and inheritance.The Salian Franks are dust; their might has perished, their annals areforgotten, their cities are leveled, their mightiest kings sleep inunmarked graves, their code has passed out of existence, almost indeedout of the memory of man,--all except one paragraph of one division ofone law. The law related to inheritance of property; the specialdivision distinguished between real and personal property, and theparagraph ruled that a woman might inherit movable property, but thatshe might not inherit land.There was not a syllable in the law relating to the inheritance of athrone. Nevertheless, centuries after the last Salian king was laid inhis barbarous grave a French prince successfully contested with anEnglish prince the crown of France, his claim resting on that obscureparagraph in the Salic code. The Hundred Years' War was fought on thisissue, and the final outcome of the war established the Salic Lawpermanently in France, and with more or less rigor in most of theEuropean states.At the time of the French Revolution, when the "Rights of Man" werebeing declared with so much fervor and enthusiasm, when the old lawswere being revised in favor of greater freedom of the individual, the"Rights of Woman" were actually revised downward. Up to this time theapplication of the Salic Law was based on tradition and precedent. Now aspecial statute was enacted forever barring women from the sovereigntyof France. "Founded on the pride of the French, who could not bear to beruled by their own women folk," as the records are careful to state.The interpretation of the Salic Law did more, a great deal more, thanexclude women from the throne. It established the principle of theinherent inferiority of women. The system of laws erected on thatprinciple were necessarily deeply tinged with contempt for women, andwith fear lest their influence in any way might affect the conduct ofstate affairs. That explains why, at the present time, although in mostEuropean countries women are allowed to practice medicine, they are notallowed to practice law. Medicine may be as learned a profession, but itaffects only human beings. The law, on the other hand, affects thestate. A woman advocate, you can readily imagine, might so influence acourt of justice that the laws of the land might suffer feminization.From the European point of view this would be most undesirable.The apparently superior rights possessed by English women were alsobestowed upon them by a vanished system of laws. They have descendedfrom Feudalism, in which social order the _person_ did not exist. Thesocial order consisted of _property_ alone, and the claims of property,that is to say, land, were paramount over the claims of the individual.Those historic women sheriffs of counties, clerks of crown,chamberlains, and high constables held their high offices because theoffices were hereditary property in certain titled families, and theyhad to belong to the entail, even when a woman was in possession. Theoffices were purely titular. No English woman ever acted as highconstable. No English woman ever attended a coronation as king'schampion. The rights and duties of these offices were delegated to amale relative. Every once in a while, during the Middle Ages, somestrong-minded lady of title demanded the right to administer her officein person, but she was always sternly put down by a rebuking House ofLords, sometimes even by the king's majesty himself.In the same way the voting powers of the women of England are a resultof hereditary privilege. Local affairs in England, until a very recentperiod, were administered through the parish, and the only personsqualified to vote were the property owners of the parish. It was reallyproperty interests and not people who voted. Those women who ownedproperty, or who were administering property for their minor children,were entitled to vote, to serve on boards of guardians, and to dispensethe Poor Laws. Out of their right of parish vote has grown their rightof municipal franchise. It carries with it a property qualification, andthe proposed Parliamentary franchise, for which the women of England aremaking such a magnificent fight, will also have a propertyqualification.The real position, legal and social, which women in England andcontinental Europe have for centuries occupied, may be gauged from anexamination of the feminist movement in a very enlightened country, sayGermany. The laws of Germany were founded on the Corpus Juris of theRomans, a stern code which relegates women to the position of chattels.And chattels they have been in Germany, until very recent years, whenthrough the intelligent persistence of strong women the chains havesomewhat been loosened.A generation ago, in 1865, to be exact, a group of women in Leipzigformed an association which they called the Allgemeinen DeutschenFrauenbund, which may be Anglicized into General Association of GermanWomen. The stated objects of the association give a pretty clear idea ofthe position of women at that time. The women demanded as their rights,Education, the Right to Work, Free Choice of Profession. Nothing more,but these three demands were so revolutionary that all masculineGermany, and most of feminine Germany, uttered horrified protests.Needless to say nothing came of the women's demand.After the Franco-Prussian War the center of the women's revolt naturallymoved to the capital of the new empire, Berlin. From that city, duringthe years that followed, so much feminine unrest was radiated that in1887 the German Woman Suffrage Association was formed, with the demandfor absolute equality with men. Two remarkable women, Minna Cauer andAnita Augsberg, the latter unmarried and a doctor of laws, were themoving spirits in the first woman suffrage agitation, which has sinceextended throughout the empire until there is hardly a small townwithout its suffrage club.Now the woman suffragist in Germany differs from the American suffragistin that she is always a member of a political party. She is a silentmember to be sure, but she adheres to her party, because, throughtradition or conviction, she believes in its policies. Usually thesuffragist is a member of the Social Democratic Party, allied to theInternational Socialist Party. She is a suffragist because she is aSocialist, because woman suffrage, and, indeed, the full equalization ofthe laws governing men and women are a part of the Socialist platform inevery country in the world. The woman member of the Social Democraticparty is not working primarily for woman suffrage. She is working for acomplete overturning of the present economic system, and she advocates_universal adult suffrage_ as a means of bringing about the social andeconomic changes demanded by the Socialists.These German Socialist women are often very advanced spirits, who holduniversity degrees, who have entered the professions, and are generallyemancipated from strictly conventional lives. Others, in large numbers,belong to the intellectual proletarian classes. Their Americanprototypes are to be found in the Women's Trade Union League, describedin a later chapter.The other German suffragists are members of the radical, the moderate(we should say conservative), and the clerical parties. These women aremiddle class, average, intelligent wives and mothers. They correspondfairly well with the women of the General Federation of Clubs in theUnited States, and like the American club women they are affiliated withthe International Council of Women. Locally they are working for thesocial reforms demanded by the first American suffrage convention, heldin Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. They are demanding the highereducation, married women's property rights, free speech, and the rightto choose a trade or profession. They are demanding other rights, fromlack of which the American woman never suffered. The right to attend apolitical meeting was until recently denied to German women. Althoughthey take a far keener and more intelligent interest in national andlocal politics than American women as a rule have ever taken, theirpresence at political meetings has but yesterday been sanctioned.The civil responsibility of the father and mother in many Europeancountries is barbarously unequal. If a marriage exists between theparents the father is the only parent recognized. He is sole guardianand authority. When divorce dissolves a marriage the rights of thefather are generally paramount, even when he is the party accused.On the other hand, if no marriage exists between the parents, if thechild is what is called illegitimate, the mother is alone responsiblefor its maintenance. Not only is the father free from allresponsibility, his status as a father is denied by law. Inquiry intothe paternity of the child is in some countries forbidden. The unhappymother may have documentary proof that she was betrayed under promise ofmarriage, but she is not allowed to produce her proof.Under the French Code, the substance of which governs all Europe, it isdistinctly a principle that the woman's honor is and ought to be of lessvalue than a man's honor. Napoleon personally insisted on thisprinciple, and more than once emphasized his belief that no importanceshould be attached to men's share in illegitimacy.These and other degrading laws the European progressive women are tryingto remove from the Codes. They have their origin in the belief in "Theimprudence, the frailty, and the imbecility" of women, to quote fromthis Code Napoleon.Whatever women's legal disabilities in the United States, their lawswere never based on the principle that women were imprudent, frail, orimbecile. They placed women at a distinct disadvantage, it is true, butit was the disadvantage of the minor child and not of the inferior, thechattel, the property of man, as in Europe.Laws in the United States were founded on the assumption that womenstood in perpetual need of protection. The law makers carried this tothe absurd extent of assuming that protection was all the right a womanneeded or all she ought to claim. They even pretended that when a womanentered the complete protection of the married state she no longer stoodin need of an identity apart from her husband. The working out of thistheory in a democracy was far from ideal, as we shall see.CHAPTER IVAMERICAN WOMEN AND THE COMMON LAWA little girl sat in a corner of her father's law library watching, withwide, serious eyes, a scene the like of which was common enough ageneration or two ago. The weeping old woman told a halting story of adissipated son, a shrewish daughter-in-law, and a state of servitude onher own part,--a story pitifully sordid in its details. The farm hadcome to her from her father's estate. For forty years she had toiledside by side with her husband, getting a simple, but comfortable,living from the soil. Then the husband died. Under the will the soninherited the farm, and everything on it,--house, furniture, barns,cattle, tools. Even the money in the bank was his. A clause in the willprovided that the son should give his mother a home during her lifetime.So here she was, after a life of hard work and loving service, shorn ofeverything; a pauper, an unpaid servant in the house of anotherwoman,--her son's wife. Was it true that the law took her home away fromher,--the farm that descended to her from her father, the house she hadlived in since childhood? Could nothing, _nothing_ be done?The aged judge shook his head, sadly. "You see, Mrs. Grant," heexplained, "the farm has never really been yours since your marriage,for then it became by law your husband's property, precisely as if hehad bought it. He had a right to leave it to whom he would. No doubt hedid what he thought was for your good. I wish I could help you, but Icannot. The law is inexorable in these matters."After the forlorn old woman had gone the lawyer's child went and stoodby her father's chair. "Why couldn't you help her?" she asked. "Why doyou let them take her home away from her?"Judge Cady opened the sheep-bound book at his elbow and showed thelittle girl a paragraph. Turning the pages, he pointed out others forher to read. Spelling through the ponderous legal phraseology the littlegirl learned that a married woman had no existence, in the eyes of thelaw, apart from her husband. She could own no property; she couldneither buy nor sell; she could not receive a gift, even from her ownhusband. She was, in fact, her husband's chattel. If he beat her she hadno means of punishing, or even restraining him, unless, indeed, shecould prove that her life was endangered. If she ran away from him thelaw forced her to return.Paragraph after paragraph the child read through, and, unseen by herfather, marked faintly with a pencil. So far as she was aware, father,and father's library of sheep-bound books, were the beginning and theend of the law, and to her mind the way to get rid of measures whichtook women's homes away from them was perfectly simple. That night whenthe house was quiet she stole downstairs, scissors in hand, determined_to cut every one of those laws out of the book_.The young reformer was restrained, but only temporarily. As ElizabethCady Stanton she lived to do her part toward revising many of the lawsunder which women, in her day, suffered, and her successors, theorganized women of the United States, are busy with their scissors,revising the rest.Not alone in Russia, Germany, France, and England do the laws governingmen and women need equalizing. In America, paradise of women, thegenerally accepted theory that women have "all the rights they want"does not stand the test of impartial examination.In America some women have all the rights they want. Your wife and thewives of the men you associate with every day usually have all therights they want, sometimes a few that they do not need at all. Is thehouse yours? The furniture yours? The motor yours? The income yours? Arethe children yours? If you are the average fond American husband, youwill return the proud answer: "No, indeed, they are _ours_."This is quite as it should be, assuming that all wives are as tenderlycherished, and as well protected as the women who live on your block.For a whole big army of women there are often serious disadvantagesconnected with that word "ours."In Boston there lived a family of McEwans,--a man, his wife, and severalhalf-grown children. McEwan was not a very steady man. He dranksometimes, and his earning capacity was uncertain. Mrs. McEwan was anenergetic, capable, intelligent woman, tolerant of her husband'sfailings, ambitious for her children. She took a large house, furnishedit on the installment plan, and filled it with boarders. The boardersgave the family an income larger than they had ever possessed before,and McEwan's contributions fell off. He became an unpaying guesthimself. All his earnings, he explained, were going into investments.The man was, in fact, speculating in mining stocks.One day McEwan came home with a face of despair. His creditors, he toldhis wife, had descended on him, seized his business, and threatened totake possession of the boarding house."But it is mine," protested the woman, with spirit. "I bought every bitof furniture with the money my boarders paid me. Nobody can touch myproperty or my earnings to satisfy a claim on you. I am not liable foryour debts."One of the boarders was a lawyer, and to him that night she took thecase. "A woman's earnings are her own in Massachusetts, are they not?"she demanded."You are what the law calls a free trader," replied the lawyer, "andwhatever you earn is yours, certainly. That is--of course you arerecorded at the city clerk's office?""Why no. Why should I be?""The law requires it. Otherwise this property, and even the money yourboarders pay you, are liable to attachment for your husband's debts.Unless you make a specific declaration that you are in business foryourself, the law assumes that the business is your husband's.""If I went to work for a salary, should I have to be recorded in orderto keep my own money?" Mrs. McEwan was growing angry."No," replied the lawyer, "not if you were careful to keep your incomeand your husband's absolutely separate. If you both paid installments ona piano the piano would be your husband's, not yours. If you bought ahouse together, the house could be seized for his debts. Everything youbuy with your money is yours. Everything you buy with money he gives youis his. Everything you buy together is his. You could not protect suchproperty from your husband's creditors, or from his heirs."Mrs. McEwan's case is mild, her wrongs faint beside those of a woman inLos Angeles, California. Her husband was a doctor, and she had been,before her marriage, a trained nurse. The young woman had saved severalhundred dollars, and she put the money into a first payment on a prettylittle cottage. During the first two or three years of the marriage thedoctor's wife, from time to time, attended cases of illness, usuallycontributing her earnings toward the payment for the house or intofurniture for the house. In all she paid about a thousand dollars, orsomething like one-third of the cost of the house. Then children came,and her earning days were over.Unfortunately the domestic affairs of this household became disturbed.The doctor contracted a drug habit. He became irregular in his conductand ended by running away with a dissolute woman. After he had gone hiswife found that the house she lived in, and which she had helped to buy,had been sold, without her knowledge or consent. The transaction wasperfectly legal. Community property, that is, property held jointly byhusband and wife, is absolutely controlled by the husband in California.In that State community property may even be given away, without thewife's knowledge or consent.It happened not many years ago that one of the most powerfulmillionaires in California, in a moment of generosity, conveyed to oneof his sons a very valuable property. Some time afterwards the fatherand son quarreled, and the father attempted to get back his property.His plea in court was that his wife's consent to the transaction hadnever been sought; but the court ruled that since the property was ownedin community, the wife's consent did not have to be obtained.This particular woman happened to be rich enough to stand the experienceof having a large slice of property given away without her knowledge,but the same law would have applied to the case of a woman who couldnot afford it at all.It is in the case of women wage earners that these laws bear thepeculiar asperity. Down in the cotton-mill districts of the South arescores of men who never, from one year to the next, do a stroke of work.They are supposed to be "weakly." Their wives and children work elevenhours a day (or night) and every pay day the men go to the mills andcollect their wages. The money belongs to them under the law. Even ifthe women had the spirit to protest, the protest would be useless. Theright of a man to collect and to spend his wife's earnings is protectedin many States in the chivalric South. In Texas, for example, a husbandis entitled to his wife's earnings even _though he has deserted her_.I do not know that this occurs very often in Texas. Probably not, unlessamong low-class Negroes. In all likelihood if a Texas woman shouldappeal to her employer, and tell him that her husband had abandoned her,he would refuse to give the man her wages. Should the husband be in aposition to invoke the law, he could claim his wife's earnings,nevertheless.The Kentucky lady who chose England for her future home, had she knownit, selected the country to which most American women owe their legaldisabilities. American law, except in Louisiana and Florida, is foundedon English common law, and English common law was developed at a periodwhen men were of much greater importance in the state than women. Thestate was a military organization, and every man was a fighter, aking's defender. Women were valuable only because defenders of kingshad to have mothers.English common law provided that every married woman must be supportedin as much comfort as her husband's estate warranted. The mothers of thenation must be fed, clothed, and sheltered. What more could theypossibly ask? In return for permanent board and clothes, the woman wasrequired to give her husband all of her property, real and personal.What use had she for property? Did she need it to support herself? Incase of war and pillage could she defend it?Husband and wife were one--and that one was the man. He was so much theone that the woman had literally no existence in the eyes of the law.She not only did not possess any property; she could possess none. Herhusband could not give her any, because there could be no contractbetween a married pair. A contract implies at least two people, andhusband and wife were one. The husband could, if he chose, establish atrusteeship, and thus give his wife the free use of her own. But you caneasily imagine that he did not very often do it.A man could, also, devise property to his wife by will. Often this wasdone, but too often the sons were made heirs, and the wife was left towhat tender mercies they owned. If a man died intestate the wife merelyshared with other heirs. She had no preference.Under the old English common law, moreover, not only the property, butalso the services of a married woman belonged to her husband. If hechose to rent out her services, or if she offered to work outside thehome, it followed logically that her wages belonged to him. What use hadshe for wages?On the other hand, every man was held responsible for the support of hiswife. He was responsible for her debts, as long as they were thenecessities of life. He was also responsible for her conduct. Beingpropertyless, she could not be held to account for wrongs committed. Ifshe stole, or destroyed property, or injured the person of another, ifshe committed any kind of a misdemeanor in the presence of her husband,and that also meant if he were in her neighborhood at the time, the lawheld him responsible. He should have restrained her.This was supposed to be a decided advantage to the woman. Whenever arebellious woman or group of women voiced their objection to the systemwhich robbed them of every shred of independence they were alwaysreminded that the system at the same time relieved them of every shredof responsibility, even, to an extent, of moral responsibility. "Sogreat a favorite," comments Blackstone, "is the female sex under thelaws of England."You may well imagine that, in these circumstances, husbands wereinterested that their wives should be very good. The law supported themby permitting "moderate correction." A married woman might be kept inwhat Blackstone calls "reasonable restraint" by her husband. But onlywith a stick no larger than his thumb.The husbandly stick was never imported into the United States. Even thedour Puritans forbade its use. The very first modification of theEnglish common law, in its application to American women, was made in1650, when the General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony decreed that ahusband beating his wife, or, for that matter, a wife beating herhusband, should be fined ten pounds, or endure a public whipping.The Pilgrim Fathers and the other early colonists in America broughtwith them the system of English common law under which they and theirancestors had for centuries been governed. From time to time, asconditions made them necessary, new laws were enacted and put intoforce. In all cases not specifically covered by these new laws, the oldEnglish common law was applied. It did not occur to any one that womenwould ever need special laws. The Pilgrim Fathers and their successors,the Puritans, simply assumed that here, as in the England they had leftbehind, woman's place was in the home, where she was protected,supported, and controlled.But in the new world woman's place in the home assumed an importancemuch greater than it had formerly possessed. Labor was scarce,manufacturing and trading were undeveloped. Woman's special activitieswere urgently needed. Woman's hands helped to raise the roof-tree, herskill and industry, to a very large extent, furnished the house. Shespun and wove, cured meat, dried corn, tanned skins, made shoes, dippedcandles, and was, in a word, almost the only manufacturer in thecountry. But this did not raise her from her position as an inferior.Woman owned neither her tools nor her raw materials. These her husbandprovided. In consequence, husband and wife being one, that one, inAmerica, as in England, was the husband.This explanation is necessary in order to understand why the legalposition of most American women to-day is that of inferiors, or, atbest, of minor children.It is necessary also, in order to understand why, except in matters oflaw, American women are treated with such extraordinary considerationand indulgence. As long as pioneer conditions lasted women were valuablebecause of the need of their labor, their special activities. Also, fora very long period, women were scarce, and they were highly prized notalone for their labor, but because their society was so desirable. Inother words, pioneer conditions gave woman a better standing in the newworld than she had in the old, and she was treated with an altogethernew consideration and regard.In England no one thought very badly of a man who was moderately abusiveof his wife. In America, violence against women was, from the first, anunbearable idea. Laws protecting maid servants, dependent women, and, aswe have seen, even wives, were very early enacted in New England.But although woman was more dearly prized in the new country than in theold, no new legislation was made for her benefit. Her legal status, orrather her absence of legal status apart from her husband, remainedexactly as it had been under the English common law.No legislature in the United States has deliberately made laws placingwomen at a disadvantage with men. Whatever laws are unfair andoppressive to women have just happened--just grown up like weeds out ofneglected soil.Let me illustrate. No lawmaker in New Mexico ever introduced a bill intothe legislature making men liable for their wives' torts or pettymisdemeanors. Yet in New Mexico, at this very minute, a wife is socompletely her husband's property that he is responsible for herbehavior. If she should rob her neighbor's clothesline, or wreck achicken yard, her unfortunate husband would have to stand trial. Simplybecause in New Mexico married women are still living under laws thatwere evolved in another civilization, long before New Mexico was dreamedof as a State.Nowhere else in the United States are women allowed to shelter theirweak moral natures behind the stern morality of their husbands, but inmore than one State the husband's responsibility for his wife's acts isassumed. In Massachusetts, for one State, if a woman owned a saloon andsold beer on Sunday, she would be liable to arrest, and so also wouldher husband, provided he were in the house when the beer was sold. Bothwould probably be fined. Simply because it was once the law that amarried woman had no separate existence apart from her husband, thisabsurd law, or others as absurd, remain on the statute books of almostevery State in the Union.The ascent of woman, which began with the abolishment of corporealpunishment of wives, proceeded very slowly. Most American women married,and most American wives were kindly treated. At least public opiniondemanded that they be treated with kindness. Long before any othermodification of her legal status was gained, a woman subjected tocruelty at the hands of her lawful spouse was at liberty to seek policeprotection.The reason why police protection was so seldom sought is plain enough.Imagine a woman complaining of a husband who would be certain to beather again for revenge, and to whom she was bound irrevocably by lawsstronger even than the laws on the statute books. Remember that the onlyright she had was the right to be supported, and if she left herhusband's house she left her only means of living. She could hardlysupport herself, for few avenues of industry were open to women. She wasliterally a pauper, and when there is nowhere else to lay his head, eventhe most miserable pauper thinks twice before he runs away from thepoorhouse. Besides, the woman who left her husband had to give up herchildren. They too were the husband's property.There were some women who hesitated before they consented to pauperizethemselves by marrying. Widows were especially wary, if old stories areto be trusted. A story is told in the New York University Law School ofa woman in Connecticut who took with her, as a part of her weddingoutfit, a very handsome mahogany bureau, bequeathed her by hergrandfather. After a few years of marriage the husband suddenly died,leaving no will. The home and all it contained were sold at auction. Thewidow was permitted to buy certain objects of furniture, and among themwas her cherished bureau. Where the poor woman found the money withwhich to buy is not revealed. In time this woman married again, andagain her husband died without a will. Again there was an auction, andagain the widow purchased her beloved heirloom. It seems possible thatthis time she had saved money in anticipation of the necessity.A little later, for she was still young and attractive, a suitorappeared, offering his heart and "all his worldly goods." "No, I thankyou," replied the sorely tried creature, "I prefer to keep my bureau."The first struggle made by women in their own behalf was against thiscondition of marital slavery. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott,Lydia Maria Child, and others of that brave band of rebellious women,were active for years, addressing legislative committees in New York andMassachusetts, circulating petitions, writing to newspapers, agitatingeverywhere in favor of married women's property rights. Finally it beganto dawn on the minds of men that there might be a certain publicadvantage, as well as private justice, attaching to separate ownershipby married women of their own property.In 1839 the Massachusetts State Legislature passed a cautious measuregiving married women qualified property rights. It was not until 1848that a really effective Married Women's Property Law was secured, byaction of the New York State Assembly. The law served as a model in manyof the new Western States just then framing their laws.These New York legislators, and the Western legislators who firstgranted property rights to married women, were actuated less by a senseof justice towards women than by enlightened selfishness. The effect ofso much freedom on women themselves was a matter for grave conjecture.It was not suggested by any of the American debaters, as it was later onthe floors of the English Parliament, that women, if they controlledtheir own property, would undoubtedly squander it on men whom theypreferred to their husbands. But it was prophesied that women once inpossession of money would desert their husbands by regiments,--whichspeaks none too flatteringly of the husbands of that day.Men of property stood for the Married Women's Property Act, because theyperceived plainly that their own wealth, devised to daughters who couldnot control it, might easily be gambled away, or wasted throughimprovidence, or diverted to the use of strangers. In other words, theyknew that their property, when daughters inherited it, became theproperty of their sons-in-law. They had no guarantee that their owngrandchildren would ever have the use of it, unless it was controlled bytheir mothers.It was the women's clubs and women's organizations in America, as it wasthe Women's Councils in Europe, that actively began the agitationagainst women's legal disabilities. The National Woman SuffrageAssociation, oldest of all women's organizations in the United States,has been calling attention to the unequal laws, and demanding theirabolishment, for two generations.Practically all of the state federations of women's clubs havelegislative committees, and it is usually the business of thesecommittees to codify the laws of their respective States which applydirectly to women. In some cases a woman lawyer is made chairman, andthe work is done under her direction. Sometimes, as in Texas, a wellknown and friendly man lawyer is retained for the task. Almostinvariably the report of the legislative committee contains disagreeablesurprises. American women have been so accustomed to their privilegesthat they have taken their rights for granted, and are usuallyastonished when they find how limited their rights actually are.There are some States in the Union where women are on terms of somethinglike equality with men. There is one State to which all intelligentwomen look with a sort of envious, admiring, questioning curiosity,Colorado, which is literally the woman's paradise. In Colorado it wouldbe difficult to find even the smallest inequality between men and women.They vote on equal terms, and if any woman deserves to go to thelegislature, and succeeds in convincing a large enough public of thefact, nothing stands in the way of her election. One woman, Mrs. AlmaLafferty, is a member of the present legislature, and she has hadseveral predecessors.But Colorado women have a larger influence still in legislativematters. To guard their interests they have a Legislative Committee ofthe State Federation of Women's Clubs, consisting of thirty to fortycarefully chosen women.This committee has permanent headquarters in Denver during every sessionof the legislature, and every bill which directly affects women andchildren, before reaching the floor of either house, is submitted forapproval to the committee.Miss Jane Addams has declared, and Miss Addams is pretty good authority,that the laws governing women and children in Colorado are superior tothose of any other State. Women receive equal pay for equal work inColorado. They are permitted to hold any office. They are co-guardiansof their children, and the education of children has been placed almostentirely in the hands of women. This does not mean that Colorado hasweakened its schools by barring men from the teaching profession. Itmeans that women are superintendents of schools in many counties, andthat one woman was, for more than ten years, State superintendent ofschools.Contrast Colorado with Louisiana, possibly the last State in the Union awell-informed woman would choose for a residence. The laws of Louisianawere based, not on the English common law, but on the Code Napoleon,which regards women merely as a working, breeding, domestic animal."There is one thing that is not _French_," thundered the great Napoleon,closing a conference on his famous code, "and that is that a woman cando as she pleases."[Illustration: A "WOMEN'S RIGHTS" MAP OF THE UNITED STATES]The framers of Louisiana's laws were particular to guard against toogreat a freedom of action on the part of its women. Toward the end ofMrs. Jefferson Davis's life she added a codicil to her will, giving to acertain chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy a number of veryvaluable relics of her husband, and of the short-lived ConfederateGovernment. Her action was made public, and it was then revealed thattwo women had signed the document as witnesses. Instantly Mrs. Davis'sattention was called to the fact that in Louisiana, where she was thenliving, no woman may witness a document. Women's signatures areworthless.In Louisiana your disabilities actually begin when you become an engagedgirl. From that happy moment on you are under the dominance of a man.Your wedding presents are not yours, but his. If you felt like giving aduplicate pickle-fork to your mother, you could not legally do so, andafter you were married, if your husband wanted that pickle-fork, hecould get it. Your clothing, your dowry, become community property assoon as the marriage ceremony is over, and community property inLouisiana is controlled absolutely by the husband. Every dollar a womanearns there is at her husband's disposal. Without her husband's consenta Louisiana woman may not go into a court of law, even though she may bein business for herself and the action sought is in defense of herbusiness.Nor does the Louisiana woman fare any better as a mother. Then, in fact,her position is nothing short of humiliating. During her husband'slifetime he is sole guardian of their children. At his death she maybecome their guardian, but if she marries a second time--and the lawpermits her to remarry, provided she waits ten months--she retains herchildren only by the formal consent of her first husband's family. Ifthey dislike her, or disapprove of her second marriage, they may demandthe custody of the children.It is true that many of these absurd laws in Louisiana are not now oftenenforced. It is also true that in Louisiana and other states few men areso unjust to their wives as to take advantage of unequal propertyrights. Laws always lag behind the sense of justice which lives in man.But the point is that unequal laws still remain on our statute books,and they may be, and sometimes are, enforced.Between these two extremes, Colorado and Louisiana, women have the otherforty-six States to choose. None of them offers perfect equality. Evenin Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah--the three States besides Colorado wherewomen vote--women are in such a minority that their votes are powerlessto remove all their disabilities. Very rarely have club women even somuch felicity as the New York State Federation, whose legislativechairman, Miss Emilie Bullowa, reported that she was unable to find asingle unimportant inequality in the New York laws governing theproperty rights of women.In most of the older States the property rights of married women are nowfairly guaranteed, but the proud boast that in America no woman is theslave of her husband will have to be modified when it is known that inat least seventeen States these rights are still denied.The husband absolutely controls his wife's property and her earnings inTexas, Tennessee, Louisiana, California, Arizona, North Dakota, andIdaho. He has virtual control--that is to say, the wife's rights aremerely provisional--in Alabama, New Mexico, and Missouri.Women to control their own business property must be registered astraders on their own account in these States: Georgia, Montana, Nevada,Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, and Virginia.Nor are women everywhere permitted to work on equal terms with men.[Illustration: MISS EMILIE BULLOWA.]There is a current belief, often expressed, that in the United Statesevery avenue of industry is open to women on equal terms with men. Thisis not quite true. In some States a married woman may not engage in anybusiness without permission from the courts. In Texas, Louisiana, andGeorgia this is the case. In Wyoming, where women vote, but where theyare in such minority that their votes count for little, a married womanmust satisfy the court that she is under the necessity of earning herliving.If you are a woman, married or unmarried, and wish to practice law, youare barred from seven of the United States. The legal profession isclosed to women in Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, Arkansas, Delaware,Tennessee, and South Carolina.In some States they discourage women from aspiring to the learnedprofessions by refusing them the advantages of higher education whichthey provide for their brothers.Four state universities close their doors to women, in spite of thefact that women's taxes help support the universities. These States areGeorgia, Virginia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The last-named admitswomen to post-graduate courses.You can hold no kind of an elective office, you cannot be even a countysuperintendent of schools in Alabama or Arkansas, if you are a woman. InAlabama, indeed, you may not be a minister of the gospel, a doctor ofmedicine, or a notary public. Florida likewise will have nothing to dowith a woman doctor.Only a few women want to hold office or engage in professional work.Every woman hopes to be a mother. What then is the legal status of theAmerican mother? When the club women began the study of their positionbefore the law they were amazed to find, in all but ten of the Statesand territories, that they had absolutely no control over the destiniesof their own children. In ten States only, and in the District ofColumbia, are women co-guardians with their husbands of their children.In Pennsylvania if a woman supports her children, or has money tocontribute to their support, she has joint guardianship. Under somewhatsimilar circumstances Rhode Island women have the same right.In all the other States and territories children belong to theirfathers. They can be given away, or willed away, from the mother. Thatthis almost never happens is due largely to the fact that, as a rule, noone except the mother of a child is especially keen to possess it.It is due also in large measure to the fact that courts of justice aregrowing reluctant to administer such archaic laws.The famous Tillman case is an example. Senator Ben Tillman of SouthCarolina has one son,--a dissipated, ill-tempered, and altogetherdisreputable man, whose wife, after several miserable years of marriedlife, left him, taking with her their two little girls. South Carolinaallows no divorce for any cause. The sanctity of the marriage tie isheld so lightly in South Carolina that the law permits it to be abusedat will by the veriest brute or libertine. Mrs. Tillman could notdivorce her husband, so she took her children and went to live quietlyat her parent's home in the city of Washington.One day the father of the children, young Tillman, appeared at thathome, and in a fit of drunken resentment against his wife, kidnapped thechildren. He could not care for the children, probably had no wish tohave them near him, but he took them back to South Carolina, and _gave_them to his parents, made a present of a woman's flesh and blood andheart to people who hated her and whom she hated in return.Under the laws of South Carolina, under the printed statutes, youngTillman had a perfect right to do this thing, and his father, a UnitedStates Senator, upheld him in his act. Young Mrs. Tillman, however,showed so little respect for the statutes that she sued her husband andhis parents to recover her babies. The judge before whom the suit wasbrought was in a dilemma. There was the law--but also there was justiceand common sense. To the everlasting honor of that South Carolina judge,justice and common sense triumphed, and he ruled that _the law wasunconstitutional._There are other hardships in this law denying to mothers the right ofco-guardianship of their children. Two names signed to a child's workingpapers is a pretty good thing sometimes, for it often happens thatselfish and lazy fathers are anxious to put their children to work,when the mothers know they are far too young. A woman in Scranton,Pennsylvania, told me, with tears filling her eyes, that her childrenhad been taken by their father to the silk mills as soon as they weretall enough to suit a not too exacting foreman. "What could I say aboutit, when he went and got the papers?" she sighed.The father--not the mother--controls the services of his children. Hecan collect their wages, and he does. Very, very often he squanders themoney they earn, and no one may interfere.A family of girls in Fall River, Massachusetts, were met every pay dayat the doors of the mill by their father, who exacted of each one herpay envelope, unopened. It was his regular day for getting drunk andindulging in an orgy of gambling. Often more than half of the girls'wages would have vanished before night. Twice the entire amount waswasted in an hour. This kept on until the girls passed their childhoodand were mature enough to rebel successfully.It is the father and not the mother that may claim the potentialservices of a child.Many times have these unjust laws been protested against. In every Statein the Union where they exist they have been protested against byorganized groups of intelligent women. But their protests have beenreceived with apathy, and, in some instances, with contempt bylegislators. Only last year a determined fight was made by the women ofCalifornia for a law giving them equal guardianship of their children.The women's bill was lost in the California Legislature, and lost by alarge majority.What arguments did the California legislators use against the proposedmeasure? Identically the same that were made in Massachusetts and NewYork a quarter of a century ago. If women had the guardianship of theirchildren, would anything prevent them from taking the children andleaving home? What would become of the sanctity of the home, with itslawful head shorn of his paternal dignity? In California a husband ishead of the family in very fact, or at least a law of the State says so.At one time the law which made the husband the head of the homeguaranteed to the family support by the husband. It does not do thatnow. There are laws on the statute books of many States obliging thewife to support her husband if he is disabled, and the children, if thehusband defaults. There are no laws compelling the husband to supporthis wife. The husband is under an assumed obligation to support hisfamily, but there exists no means of forcing him to do his duty. Familydesertion has become one of the commonest and one of the most bafflingof modern social problems. Everybody is appalled by its prevalence, butnobody seems to know what to do about it. The Legal Aid Society of NewYork City reports about three new cases of family desertion for everyday in the year. Other agencies in other cities report a state ofaffairs quite as serious.Laws have been passed in most States making family desertion amisdemeanor, and in New York a recent law has made it a felony.Unfortunately there has been devised no machinery to enforce these laws,so they are practically non-existent. It is true that if the desertinghusband is arrested he may be sent to jail or to the rock pile.But that does not cure him nor support his family. Mostly he is notarrested. He has only to take himself out of the reach of the localauthorities. In New York a deserting husband, though he is counted afelon, needs only to cross the river to New Jersey to be reasonablysafe. Imagine the State of New York spending good money to chase a manwhom it does not want as a citizen, and whom it can only punish bysending to jail for a short period. The State is better off without sucha man. To bring him back would not even benefit his deserted family.Women, far more law abiding than men, insist that a system which evolvedout of feudal conditions, and has for its very basis the assumption ofthe weakness, ignorance, and dependence of women, has no place intwentieth century civilization.American women are no longer weak, ignorant, dependent. The presentsocial order, in which military force is subordinated to industry andcommerce, narrows the gulf between them, and places men and womenphysically on much the same plane. As for women's intellectual abilityto decide their own legal status, they are, taken the country over,rather better educated than men. There are more girls than boys in thehigh schools of the United States; more girls than boys in the highergrammar grades. Fewer women than men are numbered among illiterate. Asfor the great middle class of women, it is obvious that they are betterread than their men. Their specific knowledge of affairs may be less,but their general intelligence is not less than men's.Increasingly women are ceasing to depend on men for physical support.Increasingly even married women are beginning to think of themselves asindependent human beings. Their work of bearing and rearing children, ofmanaging the household, begins to assume a new dignity, a real value,in their eyes.In New Zealand at the present time statutes are proposed which shalldetermine exactly the share a wife may legally claim in her husband'sincome. American women may not need such a law, but they insist thatthey need something to take the place of that one which in eleven Statesmakes it possible for a husband to claim all of his wife's income.CHAPTER VWOMEN'S DEMANDS ON THE RULERS OF INDUSTRYThe big elevator, crowded with shoppers to the point of actualdiscomfort, contained only one man. He wore a white-duck uniform, andrecited rapidly and monotonously, as the car shot upward: "Corsets,millinery, muslin underwear, shirt-waists, coats and suits, infants'wear, and ladies' shoes, second floor; no ma'am, carpets and rugs on thethird floor; this car don't go to the restaurant; take the other side;groceries, harness, sporting goods, musical instruments, phonographs,men's shoes, trunks, traveling bags, and toys, fifth floor."Buying and selling, serving and being served--women. On every floor, inevery aisle, at every counter, women. In the vast restaurant, whichcovers several acres, women. Waiting their turn at the long line oftelephone booths, women. Capably busy at the switch boards, women. Downin the basement buying and selling bargains in marked-down summerfrocks, women. Up under the roof, posting ledgers, auditing accounts,attending to all the complex bookkeeping of a great metropolitandepartment store, women. Behind most of the counters on all the floorsbetween, women. At every cashier's desk, at the wrappers' desks, runningback and forth with parcels and change, short-skirted women. Filling theaisles, passing and repassing, a constantly arriving and departingthrong of shoppers, women. Simply a moving, seeking, hurrying mass offemininity, in the midst of which the occasional man shopper, man clerk,and man supervisor, looks lost and out of place.To you, perhaps, the statement that six million women in the UnitedStates are working outside of the home for wages is a simple, unanalyzedfact. You grasp it as an intellectual abstraction, without muchappreciation of its human significance. The mere reading of statisticsdoes not help you to realize the changed status of women, and ofsociety. You need to see the thing with your own eyes.Standing on the corner of the Bowery and Grand Street, in New York, whenthe Third Avenue trains overhead are roaring their way uptown packedwith homeward-bound humanity, or on the corner of State and Madisonstreets, in Chicago, or on the corner of Front and Lehigh streets, inPhiladelphia; pausing at the hour of six at the junction of any city'sgreat industrial arteries, you get a full realization of the change. Ofthe pushing, jostling, clamoring mob, which the sidewalks are much toonarrow to contain, observe the preponderance of girls. From factory,office, and department store they come, thousands and tens of thousandsof girls. Above the roar of the elevated, the harsh clang of theelectric cars, the clatter of drays and wagons, the shouting ofhucksters, the laughter and oaths of men, their voices float, a shrill,triumphant treble in the orchestra of toil.You may get another vivid, yet subtle, realization of theinterdependence of women and modern industry if you manage to penetrateinto the operating-room of a telephone exchange. Any hour will do. Anyday in the week. There are no nights, nor Sundays, nor holidays in atelephone exchange. The city could not get along for one single minutein one single hour of the twenty-four without the telephone girl. Herhands move quickly over the face of the switch board, picking up long,silk-wound wires, reaching high, plugging one after another the holes ofthe switch board. The wires cross and recross, until the switch board islike a spider web, and in the tangle of lines under the hands of thetelephone girl are enmeshed the business affairs of a city.What would happen if this army of women was suddenly withdrawn from thetelephone exchanges? Men could not take their places. That experimenthas been tried more than once, and it has always failed.Having seen how well women serve industry, go back to the departmentstore and see how they dominate it also.The department store apparently exists for women. The architect whodesigned the building studied her necessities. The makers of storefurniture planned counters, shelves, and seats to suit her stature.Buyers of goods know that their jobs are forfeit unless they can guesswhat her taste in gowns and hats is going to be six months hence.WOMEN'S DEMAND ON INDUSTRY Woman dominates the department store for theplain reason that she supports it. Whoever earns the income, and thatpoint has been somewhat in question lately, there is no doubt at all asto who spends it. She does. Hence, she is able to control the conditionsunder which this business is conducted.You can see for yourself that this is so. Walk through any largedepartment store and observe how much valuable space is devoted tomaking women customers comfortable. There is always a drawing-room witheasy-chairs and couches; plenty of little desks with handsome stationerywhere the customer may write notes; here, and in the retiring-roomadjoining, are uniformed maids to offer service. But these things arenot all that the women who support industry demand of the men in power.They demand that industry be carried on under conditions favorable tothe health and comfort of the workers.Not until the development of the department store were women able toobserve at close range the conduct of modern business. Not unnaturallyit was in the department store that they began one of the most ambitiousof their present-day activities,--that of humanizing industry.It was just twenty years ago that New York City was treated to a hugejoke. It was such a joke that even the miserable ones with whom it wasconcerned were obliged to smile. An obscure group of women, callingthemselves the Working Women's Society, came out with the announcementthat they proposed to form the women clerks of the city into a laborunion.These women said that the girls in the department stores were receivingwages lower than the sweat-shop standard. They said that a foreign womanin a downtown garment shop could earn seven dollars a week, whereas anAmerican girl in a fashionable store received about four dollars and ahalf.They also charged that the city ordinance providing seats for saleswomenwas habitually violated, and that the girls were forced to stand fromten to fourteen hours a day. They said that sanitary conditions in thecloak rooms and lunch rooms of some of the stores were such as toendanger health and life. They said that the whole situation was so badthat no clerk endured it for a longer period than five years. Mostlythey were used up in two years. They proposed a labor union of retailclerks as the only possible resource. Their effort failed.The trades union idea at that time had not reached the girl behind thecounter. As a matter of fact it has not reached her yet, and it probablynever will. The department-store clerk considers herself a higher socialbeing than the ordinary working-girl, and in a way she is justified. Theexceptionally intelligent department-store clerk has one chance in athousand of rising to the well-paid, semi-professional post of buyer.Also the exceptionally attractive girl has possibly one chance in fivethousand of marrying a millionaire. It is a long chance now, and it wasa longer chance a dozen years ago, because there were fewer millionairesthen than now, but it served well enough to cause the failure of thetrades union plan.There is one thing that never fails, however, and that is a righteousprotest. Out of the protest of that little, obscure group of workingwomen in New York City was born a movement which has spread beyond theAtlantic Ocean, which has effected legislation in many States of theUnion, which has even determined an extremely important legal decisionin the Supreme Court of the United States.A group of rich and influential women, prominent in many philanthropicefforts, became interested in the Working Women's Society. Theyinvestigated the charges brought against the department stores, and whatthey discovered made them resolve that conditions must be changed.In May, 1890, the late Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, Mrs. FrederickNathan, and others, called a large mass meeting in Chickering Hall. Mrs.Nathan had a constructive plan for raising the standard in shopconditions, especially those affecting women employees.If women would simply withdraw their patronage from the stores where,during the Christmas season, women and children toiled long hours atnight without any extra compensation, sooner or later the night workwould cease. A few stores, said Mrs. Nathan, maintained a standardabove the average. It was within the power of the women of New York toraise all the others to that standard, and afterwards it might bepossible to go farther and establish a standard higher than the presenthighest."We do not desire to blacklist any firm," declared Mrs. Nathan, "but wecan _whitelist_ those firms which treat their employees humanely. We canmake and publish a list of all the shops where employees receive fairtreatment, and we can agree to patronize only those shops. By actingopenly and publishing our White List we shall be able to create animmense public opinion in favor of just employers."Thus was the Consumers' League of New York ushered into existence. Eightmonths after the Chickering Hall meeting the committee appointed toco-operate with the Working Women's Society in preparing its list offair firms had finished its work and made its report. The new League wasformally organized on January 1, 1891.[Illustration: Mrs. Frederick Nathan]THE CONSUMERS' LEAGUE "WHITE LIST"The first White List issued in New York contained only eight firm names.The number was disappointingly small, even to those who knew theconditions. Still more disappointing was the indifference of the otherfirms to their outcast position. Far from evincing a desire to earn aplace on the White List, they cast aspersions on a "parcel of women" whowere trying to "undermine business credit," and scouted the very idea ofan organized feminine conscience."Wait until the women want Easter bonnets," sneered one merchant. "Doyou think they will pass up anything good because the store is not ontheir White List?"Clearly something stronger than moral suasion was called for. Even asfar back as 1891 a few women had begun to doubt the efficacy of thatindirect influence, supposed to be woman's strongest weapon. What wasthe astonishment of the merchants when the League framed, and caused tobe introduced into the New York Assembly, a bill known as the MercantileEmployers' Bill, to regulate the employment of women and children inmercantile establishments, and to place retail stores, from thesmallest to the largest, under the inspection of the State FactoryDepartment.The bill was promptly strangled, but the next year, and the next, andstill the next, it obstinately reappeared. Finally, in 1896, four yearsafter it was first introduced, the bill struggled through the lowerHouse. In spite of powerful commercial influences the bill was reportedin the Senate, and some of the senators became warmly interested in it.A commission was appointed to make an official investigation intoconditions of working women in New York City.The findings of this Rheinhard Commission, published afterwards in twolarge volumes, were sensational enough. Merchants reluctantly testifiedto employing grown women at a salary of _thirty-three cents a day_. Theyconfessed to employing little girls of eleven and twelve years, indefiance of the child-labor law. They declared that pasteboard andwooden stock boxes were good enough seats for saleswomen; that theyshould not expect to sit down in business hours anyhow. They defended,on what they called economic grounds, their long hours and uncompensatedovertime. They defended their systems of fines, which sometimes tookaway from a girl almost the entire amount of her weekly salary. Theythreatened, if a ten-hour law for women under twenty-one years old werepassed, to employ older women. Thus thousands of young and helplessgirls would be thrown out of employment into the hands of charity.The Senate heard the report of the Rheinhard Commission, and in spite ofthe merchants' protests the women's bill was passed without a dissentingvote.The most important provision of the bill was the ten-hour limit which itplaced on the work of women under twenty-one. The overwhelming majorityof department-store clerks are girls under twenty-one. The bill alsoprovided seats for saleswomen, and specified the number ofseats,--one to every three clerks. It forbade the employment ofchildren, except those holding working certificates from theauthorities. These, and other minor provisions, affected all retailstores, as far as the law was obeyed.As a matter of fact the Consumers' League's bill carried a "joker" whichmade its full enforcement practically impossible. The matter ofinspection of stores was given over to the local boards of health,supposedly experts in matters of health and sanitation, but, as itproved, ignorant of industrial conditions. In New York City, after ayear of this inadequate inspection, political forces were brought tobear, and then there were no store inspectors.Year after year, for twelve years, the Consumers' League tried topersuade the legislature that department and other retail stores neededinspection by the State Factory Department. A little more than a yearago they succeeded. After the bill placing all retail stores underfactory inspection was passed, a committee from the Merchants'Association went before Governor Hughes and appealed to him to veto whatthey declared was a vicious and wholly superfluous measure. GovernorHughes, however, signed the bill.In the first three months of its enforcement over twelve hundredinfractions of the Mercantile Law were reported in Greater New York. Noless than nine hundred and twenty-three under-age children were takenout of their places as cash girls, stock girls, and wrappers, and weresent back to their homes or to school. The contention of the Con sumers'League that retail stores needed regulation seems to have beenjustified.To the business man capital and labor are both abstractions. To womencapital may be an abstraction, but labor is a purely human proposition,a thing of flesh and blood. The department-store owners who so bitterlyfought the Mercantile Law, and for years afterwards fought itsenforcement, were not monsters of cruelty. They were simply businessmen, with the business man's contracted vision. They could think onlyin terms of money profit and money loss.In spite of this radical difference in the point of view, women havesucceeded, in a measure, in controlling the business policy of thestores supported by their patronage.The White List would be immensely larger if the Consumers' League wouldconcede the matter of uncompensated overtime at the Christmas season.Hundreds of stores fill every condition of the standard except this one.The League stands firm on the point, and up to the present so do thestores. Only the long, slow process of public education will remove thecustom whereby _thousands of young girls and women are compelled everyholiday season to give their employers from thirty to forty hours ofuncompensated labor_.No one has ever tried to compute the amount of unpaid overtime extortedin the business departments of nearly all city stores during three tofive months of every winter. The customer, by declining to purchaseafter a certain hour, is able to release the weary saleswoman at sixo'clock. She is not able to release the equally weary girls who toil inthe bookkeeping and auditing departments.That, in these days of adding and tabulating machines, accounting inmost stores is still done by cheap hand labor, is a statement whichstrains credulity. Merely from the standpoint of business economy itseems absurd. But it is a fact easily verified.I tested it by obtaining employment in the auditing department of one ofthe largest and most respectable stores in New York. In this store, and,according to the best authorities, in most other stores, the accountingforce is made up of girls not long out of grammar school, ignorant andincapable--but cheap. They work slowly, and as each day's sales areposted and audited before the close of the day following, the businessforce has to work until nine and ten o'clock several nights in the week.In some cases they work every night.Only the enlightening power of education of employers, education ofpublic opinion, can be expected to overcome this blight, and theConsumers' League, realizing this, is preparing the way for education.The Consumers' League began with a purely benevolent motive, and inthis early philanthropic stage it gained immediate popularity. Cityafter city, State after State, formed Consumers' Leagues, until, in1899, a National League, with branches in twenty-two States, wasorganized. The National League, far from being a philanthropic society,has be come a scientific association for the study of industrialeconomics.When the original Consumers' League undertook its first piece oflegislation in behalf of women workers the members knew that they wereright, but they had very few reasons to offer in defense of theirclaim. The New York League and all of the others have been collectingreasons ever since. To-day they have a comprehensive and systematizedcollection of reasons why women should not work long hours; why theyshould not work at night; why manufacturing should not be carried on intenements; why all home wage-earning should be forbidden; why the speedof machines should be regulated by law; why pure-food laws should beextended; why minimum wage rates should be established.In the headquarters of the National League in New York City a group oftrained experts work constantly, collecting and recording a vast body offacts concerning the human side of industry. It is ammunition whichtells. One single blast of it, fired in the direction of a laundry inPortland, Oregon, two years ago, performed the wonderful feat of blowinga large hole through the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of theUnited States.There was a law in Oregon which decreed that the working day of women infactories and laundries should be ten hours long. The law was constantlyviolated, especially in the steam laundries of Portland. One night afactory inspector walked into the laundry of one Curt Muller, and foundworking there, long after closing time, one Mrs. Gotcher. The inspectorpromptly sent Mrs. Gotcher home and arrested Mr. Muller.The next day in court Mr. Muller was fined ten dollars. Instead ofpaying the fine he appealed, backed up in his action by the otherlaundrymen of Portland, on the ground that the ten-hour law for womenworkers was unconstitutional. The Fourteenth Amendment to theConstitution guarantees to every adult member of the community the rightfreely to contract. A man or a woman may contract with an employer towork as many hours a day, or a night, for whatever wages, in whateverdangerous or unhealthful or menacing conditions, _unless_ "there is fairground to say that there is material danger to the public health orsafety, or to the health and safety of the employee, or to the generalwelfare...." This is the legal decision on which most protectivelegislation in the United States has been based.Several years ago, in Illinois, a law providing an eight-hour day forwomen was declared unconstitutional because nobody's health or safetywas endangered; and on the same grounds the same fate met a New Yorklaw forbidding all-night employment of women.So Mr. Curt Muller and the laundrymen of Portland, Oregon, had reason tobelieve that they could attack the Oregon law. The case was appealed,and appealed again, by the laundrymen, and finally reached the SupremeCourt of the United States. Then the Consumers' League took a hand.The brief for the State of Oregon, "defendant in error," was prepared byLouis D. Brandeis, of Boston, assisted by Josephine Goldmark, one of themost effective workers in the League's New York headquarters. This briefis probably one of the most remarkable legal documents in existence. Itconsists of one hundred and twelve printed pages, of which a fewparagraphs were written by the attorney for the State. All the rest wascontributed, under Miss Goldmark's direction, from the Consumers'League's wonderful collection of reasons why women workers should beprotected.The League's reply to the Oregon laundrymen who asked leave to worktheir women employees far into the night was, "The World's Experienceupon Which the Legislation Limiting the Hours of Labor for Women isBased." It is simply a mass of testimony taken from hearings before theEnglish Parliament, before state legislatures, state labor boards; fromthe reports of factory inspectors in many countries; from reports ofindustrial commissions in the United States and elsewhere; from medicalbooks; from reports of boards of health.REASONS FOR PROTECTING WOMEN WORKERS The brief included a short andinteresting chapter, containing a number of things the League hadcollected on the subject of laundries. Supreme Court judges cannot beexpected to know that laundry work is classed by experts among thedangerous trades. That washing clothes, from a simple home or backyardoccupation, has been transformed into a highly-organized factory tradefull of complicated and often extremely dangerous machinery; that theatmosphere of a steam laundry is more conducive to tuberculosis and theother occupational diseases than cotton mills; that the work inlaundries, being irregular, is conducive to a general low state ofmorals; that, on the whole, women should not be required to spend moretime than necessary in laundries; all this was set forth.Medical testimony showed the physical differences between men andwomen; the lesser power of women to endure long hours of standing; theheightened susceptibility of women to industrial poisons--lead, naphtha,and the like. A long chapter of testimony on the effect of child-bearingin communities where the women had toiled long hours before marriage, orafterwards, was included.The testimony of factory inspectors, of industrial experts, of employersin England, Germany, France, America, revealed the bad effect of longhours on women's safety, both physical and moral. It revealed the goodeffect, on the individual health, home life, and general welfare, ofshort hours of labor.Nor was the business aspect of the case neglected. That peopleaccomplish as much in an eight-hour day as in a twelve-hour day hasactually been demonstrated. The brief stated, for one instance, theexperience of a bicycle factory in Massachusetts.In this place young women were employed to sort the ball bearings whichwent into the machines. They did this by touch, and no girl was of useto the firm unless her touch was very sensitive and very sure. The headof this firm became convinced that the work done late in the afternoonwas of inferior quality, and he tried the experiment of cutting thehours from ten to nine. The work was done on piece wages, and the girlsat first protested against the nine-hour day, fearing that their payenvelopes would suffer. To their astonishment they earned as much innine hours as they had in ten. In time the employer cut the working daydown to eight hours and a half, and in addition gave the girlsten-minute rests twice a day. Still they earned their full wages, andthey continued to earn full wages after the day became eight hourslong. The employer testified before the United States IndustrialCommission of 1900 that he believed he could successfully shorten theday to seven hours and a half and get the same amount of workaccomplished.What can you do against testimony like that? The Consumers' Leagueconvinced the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Oregonten-hour law was upheld.The importance of this decision cannot be overestimated. On it hangs thevalidity of nearly all the laws which have been passed in the UnitedStates for the protection of women workers. If the Oregon law had beendeclared unconstitutional, laws in twenty States, or practically allthe States where women work in factories, would have been in perpetualdanger, and the United States might easily have sunk to a positionoccupied now by no leading country in Europe.Great Britain has had protective legislation for women workers since1844. In 1847 the labor of women in English textile mills was limited toten hours a day, the period we are now worrying about, as being possiblycontrary to our Constitution. France, within the past five years, hasestablished a ten-hour day, broken by one hour of rest. Switzerland,Germany, Holland, Austria, Italy, limit the hours of women's labor. Inseveral countries there are special provisions giving extra time off towomen who have household responsibilities. What would ourConstitution-bound law makers say to such a proposition, if any one hadthe hardihood to suggest it?If this law had not been upheld by the United States Supreme Court thewomen of no State could have hoped to secure further legislation forwomen workers. As it is, women in many States are preparing to establishwhat is now known as "The Oregon Standard," that is, a ten-hour day forall working women.Nothing in connection with the woman movement is more significant,certainly nothing was more unexpected, than the voluntary abandonment,on the part of women, of class prejudice and class distinctions. Whereformerly the interest of the leisured woman in her wage-earning sisterswas of a sentimental or philanthropic character, it has become practicaland democratic.The Young Women's Christian Association has had an industrialdepartment, which up to a recent period concerned itself merely with thespiritual welfare of working girls. Prayer meetings in factories, clubs,and classes in the Association headquarters, working-girls' boardinghomes, and other philanthropic efforts were the limits of theAssociation's activities. The entire policy has changed of late, andunder the capable direction of Miss Annie Marian MacLean, of Brooklyn,New York, the industrial department of the Association is doingscientific investigation of labor conditions of women.In a cracker factory I once saw a paid worker in the Young Women'sChristian Association pause above a young girl lying on the floor,crimson with fever, and apparently in the throes of a serious illness.With angelic pity on her face the Association worker stooped andslipped a tract into the sick girl's hand. The kind of industrialsecretary the Association now employs would send for an ambulance andsee that the girl had the best of hospital care. She would inquirewhether the girl's illness was caused by the conditions under which sheworked, and she would know if it were possible to have those conditionschanged.WOMEN'S CLUBS STUDYING LABOR PROBLEMS Nearly every state federation ofwomen's clubs has its industrial committee, and many large clubs have acorresponding department. It is these industrial sections of the women'sclubs which are such a thorn in the flesh of Mr. John Kirby, Jr., thenew president of the National Manufacturers' Association. In hisinaugural address Mr. Kirby warned his colleagues that women's clubswere not the ladylike, innocuous institutions that too-confiding mansupposed them to be. In those clubs, he declared, their own wives anddaughters were listening to addresses by the worst enemies of theManufacturers' Association, the labor leaders. By which he meant thatthe club women were inviting trade-union men and women to present theworker's side of industrial subjects. "Soon," exclaimed Mr. Kirby, "weshall have to fight the women as well as the unions."The richest and most aristocratic woman's club in the country is theColony Club of New York. The Colony Club was organized by a number ofwomen from the exclusive circles of New York society, after the mannerof men's clubs. The women built a magnificent clubhouse on MadisonAvenue, furnished it with every luxury, including a wonderfulroof-garden. For a time the Colony Club appeared to be nothing morethan a beautiful toy which its members played with. But soon it began todevelop into a sort of a woman's forum, where all sorts of social topicswere discussed. Visiting women of distinction, artists, writers,lecturers, were entertained there.Last year the club inaugurated a Wednesday afternoon course inindustrial economics. The women did not invite lecturers from ColumbiaUniversity to address them. They asked John Mitchell and many lesserlights of the labor world. They wanted to learn, at first hand, thefacts concerning conditions of industry. Most of them are stockholdersin mills, factories, mines, or business establishments. Many own realestate on which factories stand."It is not fair," they have openly declared, "that we should enjoywealth and luxury at the cost of illness, suffering, and death. We donot want wealth on such terms."The Colony Club members, and the women who form the Auxiliary to theNational Civic Federation, have for their object improvement in theworking and living conditions of wage earners in industries and ingovernmental institutions. A few conscientious employers have spent apart of their profits to make their employees comfortable. They havegiven them the best sanitary conditions, good air, strong light, andcomfortable seats. They have provided rest rooms, lunch rooms, vacationhouses, and the like.No one should belittle such efforts on the part of employers. Equally,no one should regard them as a solution of the industrial problem. Norshould they be used as a substitute for justice.Too often this so-called welfare work has been clumsily managed,untactfully administered. Too often it has been instituted, not tobenefit the workers, but to advertise the business. Too often its realobject was a desire to play the philanthropist's role, to exactobsequience from the wage earner.[Illustration: MRS. J. BORDEN HARRIMAN President of the Colony Club, NewYork, the most exclusive Women's Club in the country]I know a corset factory which makes a feature in its advertising of theperfect sanitary condition of its works; when visitors are expected, thegirls are required to stop work and clean the rooms. Since they work ona piece-work scale, the "perfect sanitary conditions" exist at theirexpense. In a department store I know, employees are required to sign aprinted expression of gratitude for overtime pay or an extra holiday.This kind of welfare work simply alienates employees from theiremployers. It always fails.It seems to the women who have studied these things that propersanitary conditions, lunch rooms, comfortable seats, provision forrest, vacations with pay, and the like are no more than the wageearner's due. They are a part of the laborer's hire, and should beguaranteed by law, exactly as wages are guaranteed. An employer deservesgratitude for overtime pay no more than for fire escapes.Testimony gathered from all sources by the Consumers' League, women'sclubs, and women's labor organizations has proved beyond doubt that goodworking conditions, reasonable hours of work, and living wages vastlyincrease the efficiency of the workers, and thus increase the profits ofthe employers.The New York Telephone Company does not set itself up to be abenevolent institution. Its directors know that its profits depend onthe excellence of its service. There is one exchange in the Borough ofBrooklyn which handles a large part of the Long Island traffic. Thistraffic is very heavy in summer on account of the number of summerresorts along the coast. In the fall and winter the traffic is verylight. Six months in the year the operators at this exchange work onlyhalf the day, yet the company keeps them on full salary the year round."We cannot afford to do anything else," explains the traffic manager."We cannot afford operators who would be content with half wages."[Illustration: MISS ELIZABETH MALONEY]The old-time dry-goods merchant sincerely believed that his businesswould suffer if he provided seats for his saleswomen. He believed thathe would go into bankruptcy if he allowed his women clerks humanworking conditions. Then came the Consumers' League and mercantile laws,and a new pressure of public opinion, and the dry-goods merchant foundout that a clerk in good physical condition sells more goods than onethat is exhausted and uncomfortable.The fact is that welfare work, carefully shorn of its name, has proveditself to be such good business policy that in future all intelligentemployers will advocate it; public opinion will demand it; laws willprovide for it.It used to be the invariable custom in stores--it is so still in afew--to lay off many clerks during the dull seasons. Now the best storesfind that they can better afford to give all their employees vacationswith pay. A clerk coming home after a vacation can sell goods, even indull times. More and more employers are coming to appreciate the moneyvalue of the Saturday half-holiday in summer. Hearn, in New York, closeshis department store all day Saturday during July and August. The storesells more goods in five days than it previously sold in six.THE FILENE SYSTEM OF DEVELOPING EFFICIENT WORKERS There is onedepartment store which has demonstrated that it is profitable to payhigher wages than its competitors, and that it pays to allow theemployees to fix the terms of their own employment. This is the Filenestore in Boston, which has developed within the past ten years from aconservative, old-fashioned dry-goods business into an extremelyoriginal and interesting experiment station in commercial economics.The entire policy of the Filene management is bent on developing to thehighest possible point the efficiency of each individual clerk. The bestpossible material is sought. No girl under sixteen is employed, and nogirl of any age who has not graduated with credit from the grammarschools. There are a number of college-bred men and women in the Fileneemploy.[Illustration: A DEPARTMENT STORE REST-ROOM FOR WOMEN]Good wages are paid, even to beginners, and experienced employees arerewarded, not according to a fixed rate of payment, but according toearning capacity. Taken throughout the store, wages, plus commissions,which are allowed in all departments, average about two dollars a weekhigher than in other department stores in Boston.No irresponsible, automatic employee can develop high efficiency. Shedoes not want to become efficient; she wants merely to receive a payenvelope at the end of the week. In order to develop responsibility andinitiative in their employees the Filenes have put them on aself-governing basis. The workers do not literally make their own rules,but the vote of the majority can change any rule made by the firm. Thefirm furnishes its employees with a printed book of rules, in which thepolicy of the store is set forth. If the employees object to any of therules, or any part of the policy, they can vote a change.The medium through which the clerks express their opinions and desiresis the Filene Co-operative Association, of which every clerk and everyemployee in the place is a member. No dues are exacted, as is the customin the usual employees' association. The executive body, called theStore Council, and all other officers are elected by the members. Allmatters of grievance, all subjects of controversy, are referred to theStore Council, which, as often as occasion demands, calls a meeting ofthe entire association after business hours.For example: Christmas happens on a Friday. The firm decides to keep thestore open on the following day--Saturday. There is an expression ofdissatisfaction from a number of clerks. A meeting of the association iscalled, and a vote taken as to whether the majority want the extraholiday or not; whether the majority are willing to lose thecommissions on a day's sales, for, of course, salaries continue. Thevote reveals that the majority want the holiday. The Store Council soreports to the firm, and the firm must grant the holiday.All matters of difficulty arising between employers and employed, in theFilene store, are settled not by the firm, but by the Arbitration Boardof Employees, also elected by popular vote. All disagreements as towages, position, promotion, all questions of personal issue betweensaleswomen and aislemen, or others in authority, are referred to theBoard of Arbitration, and the board's decision is final. There is notyranny of the buyer, no arbitrary authority of the head of adepartment. Every clerk knows that her tenure is secure as long as sheis an efficient saleswoman.Surely it is not too much to hope that, in a future not too fardistant, all women who earn their bread will serve a system of industryadjusted by law to human standards. In enlightened America the courts,presided over by men to whom manual labor is known only in theory, havepersistently ruled that the _Constitution forbade the State to make lawsprotecting women workers_. It has seemed to most of our courts and mostof our judges that the State fulfilled its whole duty to its womencitizens when it guaranteed them the right freely to contract--eventhough they consented, or their poverty consented, to contracts whichinvolved irreparable harm to themselves, the community, and futuregenerations. The women of this country have done nothing more importantthan to educate the judiciary of the United States out of and beyondthis terrible delusion.CHAPTER VIMAKING OVER THE FACTORY FROM THE INSIDEThe decision of the United States Supreme Court, establishing thelegality of restricted hours of labor for Oregon working women, wasreceived with especial satisfaction in the State of Illinois. TheIllinois working women, or that thriving minority of them organized inlabor unions, had been waiting sixteen years for a favorable opportunityto get an eight-hour day for themselves. Sixteen years ago the IllinoisState Legislature gave the working women such a law, and two years laterthe Illinois Supreme Court took it away from them, on the ground that itwas unconstitutional.The action of the Illinois Supreme Court was by no means withoutprecedent. Many similar decisions had been handed down in other States,until it had become almost a principle of American law that protectivelegislation for working women was invalid.The process of reasoning by which learned judges reach the conclusionthat an eight-hour day for men may be decreed without depriving anybodyof his constitutional rights, and at the same time rule that women wouldbe outrageously wronged by having their working hours limited, mayappear obscure.The explanation is, after all, simple. The learned judges are men, andthey know something--not much, but still something--about the men of theworking classes. They know, for example, something about the conditionsunder which coal miners work, and they can see that it is contrary topublic interests that men should toil underground, at arduous labor,twelve hours a day. Accidents result with painful frequency, and theseare bad things,--bad for miners and mine owners alike. They are bad forthe whole community. Therefore the regulation of miners' hours of laborcomes legitimately under the police powers of the law.The learned judges, I say this with all due respect, do not knowanything about working women. Their own words prove it. The texts oftheir decisions, denying the constitutionality of protective measures,are amazing in the ignorance they display,--ignorance of industrialconditions surrounding women; ignorance of the physical effects ofcertain kinds of labor on young girls; ignorance of the effect ofwomen's arduous toil on the birth rate; ignorance of moral conditions intrades which involve night work; ignorance of the injury to the homeresulting from the sweated labor of tenement women. In brief, thelearned judges, when they write opinions involving the health, thehappiness, the very lives of women workers, might be writing about theinhabitants of another planet, so little knowledge do they display ofthe real facts.We have seen how the women of the Consumers' League taught the UnitedStates Supreme Court something about working women; showed them a few ofthe calamities resulting from the unrestricted labor of women andimmature girls. The Supreme Court's decision forever abolished the oldfallacy that the American Constitution _forbids_ protective legislationfor women workers. It remains for women's organizations in the variousStates to educate local courts up to the knowledge that communityinterest _demands_ protective legislation.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Oregon case, whichflatly contradicted the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court, theworking women of Illinois began their educational campaign. They hadnow, for the first time, a fighting chance to secure the restoration oftheir shortened work day. The women of fifteen organized trades in thecity of Chicago determined to take that chance.The women first appealed to the Industrial Commission, appointed earlyin 1908 by Governor Dineen, to investigate the need of protectivelegislation for workers, men and women alike.The women were given a courteous hearing, but were told frankly thatlimited hours of work for women was not one of protective measures to berecommended by the Commission.The Waitresses' Union, Local No. 484, of Chicago, entered the lists, ledby a remarkable young woman, Elizabeth Maloney, financial secretary ofthe union. Miss Maloney and her associates drafted and introduced intothe Illinois Legislature a bill providing an eight-hour working day forevery woman in the State, working in shop, factory, retail store,laundry, hotel, or restaurant, and providing also ample machinery forenforcing the measure.The "Girls' Bill," as it immediately became known, was the most hotlycontested measure passed by the Illinois Legislature during thesession. Over five hundred manufacturers appeared at the public hearingon the bill to protest against it. One man brought a number of meek andtired women employees, who, he declared, were opposed to having theirworking day made shorter. Another presented a petition signed by hiswomen employees, appealing against being prevented from working elevenhours a day!Nine working girls appeared in support of the bill, and after learnedcounsel for the Manufacturers' Association had argued against themeasure, two of the girls were allowed to speak. The Manufacturers'Association presented the business aspect of the question, the girlsconfined themselves to the human side. Agnes Nestor, secretary of theGlove Makers' Union of the United States and Canada, was one of the twogirls who spoke. Miss Nestor, whose eyes are blue, whose manners aregentle, and whose best weight is ninety-five pounds, had to stand on achair that the law makers might see her when she made her plea:Elizabeth Maloney, of the Waitresses' Union, was the other speaker.They described details in the daily lives of working women not generallyknown except to the workers themselves. Among these was the piece-worksystem, which too often means a system whereby the utmost possible speedis extorted from the toiler, in order that she may earn a living wage.The legislators were asked to imagine themselves operating a machinewhose speed was gauged up to nine thousand stitches a minute; toconsider how many stitches the operator's hand must guide in a week, amonth, a year, in order to earn a living; working thus eleven, twelvehours a day, knowing that the end was nervous breakdown, and decreaseof earning power."I am a waitress," said Miss Maloney, "and I work ten hours a day. Inthat time a waitress who is tolerably busy _walks_ ten miles, and thedishes she carries back and forth aggregate in weight fifteen hundred totwo thousand pounds. Don't you think eight hours a day is enough for agirl to walk?"Only one thing stood in the way of the passage of the bill after thatday. The doubt of its constitutionality proved an obstacle too gravefor the friends of the workers to overcome. It was decided tosubstitute a ten-hour bill, an exact duplicate of the "Oregon Standard"established by the Supreme Court of the United States. The principle oflimitation upon the hours of women's work once established in Illinois,the workers could proceed with their fight for an eight-hour day.The manufacturers lost their fight, and the ten-hour bill became a lawof the State of Illinois. The Manufacturers' Association, through theW.C. Ritchie Paper Box Manufactory, of Chicago, immediately brought suitto test the constitutionality of the law. Two Ritchie employees, AnnaKusserow and Dora Windeguth, made appeal to the Illinois courts. Theirappeal declared that they could not make enough paper boxes in ten hoursto earn their bread, and that their constitutional rights freely tocontract, as well as their human rights, had been taken away from themby the ten-hour law.There was a terrible confession, on the part of the employers, involvedin this protest against the ten-hour day, a confession of the wretchedstate of women's wages in the State of Illinois. If women of matureyears--one of the petitioners had been an expert box maker for overthirty years--are unable, in a day of ten hours, to earn enough to keepbody and soul together, is it not proved that women workers are in noposition freely to contract? For who, of her own free will, wouldcontract to work ten hours a day for less than the price of life?There was sitting in the Circuit Court of Illinois at that time JudgeR.S. Tuthill. When Judge Tuthill, in old age, reviews the events of hiscareer, I think he will not remember with pride that he was blind to thereal meaning of that petition of Anna Kusserow and Dora Windeguth. ForJudge Tuthill issued an injunction against the State Factory Department,forbidding them to enforce the ten-hour law.Immediately a number of women's organizations joined hands with thewomen's trade unions in the fight to save the bill. When it came up inthe December term of the Illinois Supreme Court, Louis D. Brandeis ofBoston, the same able jurist who had argued the Oregon case, was onhand. This time his brief was a book of six hundred and ten printedpages, over which Miss Pauline Goldmark, of the National Consumers'League, and a large corps of trained investigators and students hadtoiled for many months. The World's Experience Against the IllinoisCircuit Court, this document might well have been called. It was simplya digest of the evidence of governmental commissions, laboratories, andbodies of scientific research, on the effects of overwork, andespecially of overtime work, on girls and women, and through them onthe succeeding generation. Incidentally the brief contained threepages of law.The most striking part of the argument contained in the brief was thetestimony of physicians on the toxin of fatigue."Medical Science has demonstrated," says this most important paragraph,"that while fatigue is a normal phenomenon ... excessive fatigue orexhaustion is abnormal.... It has discovered that fatigue is due notonly to actual poisoning, but to a specific poison or toxin of fatigue,entirely analogous in chemical and physical nature to other bacterialtoxins, such as the diphtheria toxin. It has been shown that whenartificially injected into animals in large amounts the fatigue toxincauses death. The fatigue toxin in normal quantities is said to becounteracted by an antidote or antitoxin, also generated in the body.But as soon as fatigue becomes abnormal the antitoxin is not producedfast enough to counteract the poison of the toxin."The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois decided that the AmericanConstitution was never intended to shield manufacturers in theirwillingness to poison women under pretense of giving them work. Theten-hour law was sustained.That the "Girls' Bill" passed, or that it was even introduced, was duein large measure to an organization of women, more militant and moredemocratic than any other in the United States. This is the Women'sTrade Union League. Formed in New York about seven years ago, theLeague consists of women members of labor unions, a few men in organizedtrades, and many women outside the ranks of wage earners. Some of theselatter are women of wealth, who are believers in the trade-unionprinciple, but more are women who work in the professionalranks,--teachers, lawyers, physicians, writers, artists, settlementworkers. These are the first professional workers, men or women, whoever asked for and were given affiliation with the American Federationof Labor. They are the first people, outside the ranks of wage earners,to appear in Labor Day parades.The object of the League, which now has branches in five cities,--NewYork, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland,--is to educate womenwage earners in the doctrine of trade unionism. The League trains andsupports organizers among all classes of workers. As quickly as a groupin any trade seems ready for organizing the League helps them. Itraises funds to assist women in their trade struggles. It acts asarbitrator between employer and wage earners in case of shop disputes.The Women's Tracle Union League reaches not only women in factorytrades, but it has succeeded in organizing women who until latelybelieved themselves to be a grade above this social level. One hundredand fifty dressmakers in New York City belong to a union. Seventystenographers have organized in the same city. The Teachers' Federationof Chicago is a labor union, and although it was formed before theWomen's Trade Union League came into existence, it is now affiliated.The women telegraphers all over the United States are well organized.The businesslike, resourceful, and fearless policy of the League wasbrilliantly demonstrated during the famous strike of the shirt-waistmakers in New York and Philadelphia in the winter of 1910. The story ofthis strike will bear retelling.On the evening of November 22, 1909, there was a great mass meeting ofworkers held at Cooper Union in New York. Samuel Gompers, President ofthe American Federation of Labor, presided, and the stage was wellfilled with members of the Women's Trade Union League. The meeting hadbeen called by the League in conjunction with Shirt-Waist Makers' Union,Local 25, to consider the grievances of shirt-waist makers in general,and especially of the shirt-waist makers in the Triangle factory, whohad been, for more than two months, on strike.The story of the strike, the causes that led up to it, and the bitterinjustice which followed it were rehearsed in a dozen speeches. It wasshown that for four to five dollars a week the girl shirt-waist makersworked from eight in the morning until half-past five in the eveningtwo days in the week; from eight in the morning until nine at nightfour days in the week; and from eight in the morning until noon one dayin the week--Sunday.The shirt-waist makers in the Triangle factory, in hope of betteringtheir conditions, had formed a union, and had informed their employersof their action. The employers promptly locked them out of the shop, andthe girls declared a strike.The strike was more than two months old when the Cooper Union meetingwas held, and the employers showed no signs of giving in. It was agreedthat a general strike of shirt-waist makers ought to be declared. Butthe union was weak, there were no funds, and most of the shirt-waistmakers were women and unused to the idea of solidarity in action. Couldthey stand together in an industrial struggle which promised to be longand bitter?President Gompers was plainly fearful that they could not.Suddenly a very small, very young, very intense Jewish girl, known toher associates as Clara Lemlich, sprang to her feet, and, with theassistance of two young men, climbed to the high platform. Flinging upher arms with a dramatic gesture she poured out a flood of speech,entirely unintelligible to the presiding Gompers, and to the members ofthe Women's Trade Union League. The Yiddish-speaking majority in theaudience understood, however, and the others quickly caught the spiritof her impassioned plea.The vast audience rose as one man, and a great roar arose. "Yes, wewill all strike!""And will you keep the faith?" cried the girl on the platform. "Will youswear by the old Jewish oath of our fathers?"Two thousand Jewish hands were thrust in air, and two thousand Jewishthroats uttered the oath: "If I turn traitor to the cause I now pledge,may this hand wither and drop off from this arm I now raise."Clara Lemlich's part in the work was accomplished. Within a few daysforty thousand shirt-waist makers were on strike.The Women's Trade Union League, under the direction of Miss Helen Marot,secretary, at once took hold of the strike.There were two things to be done at once. The forty thousand had to beenrolled in the union, and those manufacturers who were willing toaccept the terms of the strikers had to be "signed up." Clinton Hall,one of the largest buildings on the lower East Side, was secured, andfor several weeks the rooms and hallways of the building and the streetoutside were crowded almost to the limit of safety with men and womenstrikers, anxious and perspiring "bosses," and busy, active associatesof the Women's Trade Union League.The immediate business needs of the organization being satisfied theLeague members undertook the work of picketing the shops. Picketing, ifthis activity has not been revealed to you, consists in patrolling theneighborhood of the factories during the hours when the strike breakersare going to and from their nefarious business, and importuning them tojoin the strike.Peaceful picketing is legal. The law permits a striker to speak to thegirl who has taken her place, permits her to present her cause in hermost persuasive fashion, but if she lays her hand, ever so gently on theother's arm or shoulder, this constitutes technical violence.Up to the time when the League began picketing there had been a littleof this technical, and possibly an occasional act of real, violence.After the League took a hand there was none. Each group of union girlswho went forth to picket was accompanied by one or more League members.Some of these amateur pickets were girls fresh from college, and amongthese were Elsie Cole, the brilliant daughter of Albany's Superintendentof Schools, Inez Milholland, the beautiful and cherished daughter of amillionaire father, leader of her class, of 1909, in Vassar College,Elizabeth Dutcher and Violet Pike, both prominent in the Association ofCollegiate Alumnae. These young women went out day after day with girlstrikers, endured the insults and threats of the police, suffered arreston more than one occasion, and faced the scorn and indignation ofmagistrates who--well, who did not understand.The strike received an immense amount of publicity, and organizations ofwomen other than the Women's Trade Union League began to take aninterest in it. They sent for Miss Marot, Miss Cole, Miss GertrudeBarnum, and other women known to be familiar with the industrial worldof women, and begged for enlightenment on the subject of the strike.They particularly asked to hear the story from the striking women inperson.The exclusive Colony Club, to which only women of the highest socialeminence are eligible, was called together by Miss Anne Morgan andseveral others, including Mrs. Egerton Winthrop, wife of the presidentof the New York Board of Education, to hear the story from the strikers'own lips. The Colony Club was swept into the shirt-waist strike. Morethan thirteen hundred dollars was collected in a few minutes. A dozenwomen promised influence and personal service in behalf of the strikers.A week later Mrs. O.H.P. Belmont, mother of the Duchess of Marlborough,leader of a large Woman Suffrage Association, engaged the Hippodrome,and packed it to the roof with ten thousand interested spectators.Something like five thousand dollars was donated by this meeting.At the beginning of the strike fully five hundred waist houses wereinvolved. Many of these settled within a few days on the basis ofincreased pay, a fifty-two-hour working week, and recognition of theunion. Others settled later, and under the influence of the "uptownscum," as the employers' association gallantly termed the Women's TradeUnion League, the Colony Club, and the Suffragists, still othersreluctantly gave in. Late in January all except about one hundred out ofthe five hundred had settled with the union, and only about threethousand of the workers were still out of work.Women have been called the scabs of the labor world. That they wouldever become trade unionists, ever evolve the class consciousness of theintelligent proletarian men, was deemed an impossible dream. Above all,that their progress towards industrial emancipation would ever be helpedalong by the wives and daughters of the employing classes wasunthinkable. That the releasing of one class of women from householdlabor by sending another class of women into the factory, there toperform their historic tasks of cooking, sewing, and laundry work, wasto result in the humanizing of industry, no mind ever prophesied.Yet these things are coming. The scabs of the labor world are becomingthe co-workers instead of the competitors of men. The women of theleisure classes, almost as fast as their eyes are opened to thesituation, espouse the cause of their working sisters. The woman in thefactory is preparing to make over that factory or to close it.The history of a recent strike, in a carpet mill in Roxbury,Massachusetts, is a perfect history, in miniature, of the progress ofthe working women.That particular mill is very old and very well known. When it wasestablished, more than a generation ago, the owner was a man who knewevery one of his employees by name, was especially considerate of thewomen operatives, and was loved and respected by every one. Hours oflabor were long, but the work was done in a leisurely fashion, and wageswere good enough to compensate for the long day's labor.The original owner died, and in time the new firm changed to acorporation. The manager knew only his office force and possibly a fewfloor superintendents and foremen. The rest of the force were "hands."The whole state of the industry was altered. New and complicatedmachinery was introduced. The shortened work day was a hundred timesmore fatiguing to the workers because of the increased speed andnerve-racking noise and jar of the machinery. Other grievancesdeveloped. The quality of the yarn furnished the weavers was often sobad that they spent hours of unpaid labor mending a broken warp ormanipulating a rotten shuttle full of yarn. Wages, fixed according tothe piece system, declined, it is said, at least one-fourth. Women whohad formerly earned thirteen dollars a week were reduced to seven andeight dollars.The women formed a union and struck. Some of them had been in the millsas long as forty years, but they walked out with the girls.There you have the story of women's realization of themselves as agroup. Next you encounter the realization of the sisterhood of women.The Boston Branch of the Women's Trade Union League, through itssecretary, Mabel Gillespie, Radcliffe graduate, joined the strikers.Backed up by the Boston Central Labor Union, and the United TextileWorkers of Fall River, the strikers fought their fight during ten weeksof anxiety and deprivation.The employers were firm in their determination to go out of businessbefore treating with the strikers as a group. A hand, mind you, existsas an individual, a very humble individual, but one to be received andconferred with. Hands, considered collectively, have no just right toexist. An employers' association is a necessity of business life. Alabor union is an insult to capital.This was the situation at the end of ten weeks. One day a motor carstopped in front of the offices of the mills and a lady emerged. Mrs.Glendower Evans, conservative, cultured, one might say Back Baypersonified, had come to Roxbury to see the carpet manufacturer. Herpowers of persuasion, plus her social position and her commercialconnections, were sufficient to wring consent from the firm to receiveJohn Golden, president of the United Textile Workers.John Golden, intelligent, honest, a fine type of workingman, educatedin the English school of unionism, held two conferences with the firm.He was able to make the employers see the whole situation in an entirelynew light. They were men of probity; they wanted to be fair; and whenthey saw the human side of the struggle they surrendered. When theyperceived the justice of the collective bargain, the advantages to bothsides of a labor organization honestly conducted, they consented torecognize the union. And the women went back, their group unbroken.Thus are women working, women of all classes, to humanize the factory.From the outside they are working to educate the legislatures and thejudiciary. They are lending moral and financial support to the women ofthe toiling masses in their struggle to make over the factory from theinside. Together they are impressing the men of the working world, lawmakers and judges, with the justice of protecting the mothers of therace.Now that the greatest stumbling block to industrial protectivelegislation has been removed, we may hope to see a change in legaldecisions handed down in our courts. The educational process is notyet complete. Not every judge possesses the prophetic mind of thelate Justice Brewer, who wrote the decision in the Oregon Case. Notevery court has learned that healthy men and women are infinitely morevaluable to a nation than mere property. But in time they will learn.In distant New Zealand, not long ago, there was a match factory in whicha number of women worked for low wages. After fruitless appeals to theowner for better wages the workers resorted to force. They did notstrike. In New Zealand you do not have to strike, because in thatcountry a substitute for the strike is provided by law. To thissubstitute, a Court of Arbitration, the women took their grievance. Theemployer in his answer declared, just as employers in this country mighthave done, that his business would not stand an increase in wages. Heexplained that the match industry was newly established in New Zealand,and that, until it was on a secure basis, factory owners could notafford to pay high wages.The judge ordered an inquiry. In this country it would have been aninquiry into the state of the match industry. There it was an inquiryinto the cost of living in the town where the match factory was located.And then the judge summoned the factory owner to the Court ofArbitration, and this is what he said to the man:"It is impossible for these girls to live decently or healthfully on thewages you are now paying. It is of the utmost importance that theyshould have wholesome and healthful conditions of life. The souls andbodies of the young women of New Zealand are of more importance thanyour profits, and if you cannot pay living wages it will be better forthe community for you to close your factory. _It would be better tosend the whole match industry to the bottom of the ocean, and go back toflints and firesticks, than to drive young girls into the gutter._ Myaward is that you pay what they ask."Does that sound like justice to you? It does to me; it does to the eightmillion women in the world who have learned to think in human terms.CHAPTER VIIBREAKING THE GREAT TABOOAt the threshold of that quarter of old New York called GreenwichVillage stands Jefferson Market Court. Almost concealed behind thetowering structure of the Sixth Avenue Elevated, the building by day israther inconspicuous. But when night falls, swallowing up theneighborhood of tangled streets and obscure alleyways, Jefferson Marketassumes prominence. High up in the square brick tower an illuminatedclock seems perpetually to be hurrying its pointing hands towardmidnight. From many windows, barred for the most part, streams anintense white light. Above an iron-guarded door at the side of thebuilding floats a great globe of light, and beneath its glare, throughthe iron-guarded door, there passes, every week-day night in the year, along procession of prodigals.The guarded door seldom admits any one as important, so to speak, as acriminal. The criminal's case waits for day. The Night Court inJefferson Market sits in judgment only on the small fry caught in thedragnet of the police. Tramps, vagrants, drunkards, brawlers, disturbersof the peace, speeding chauffeurs, licenseless peddlers, youths caughtred-handed shooting craps or playing ball in the streets,--these are themen with whom the Night Court deals. But it is not the men we have cometo see.[Illustration: MISS MAUDE E. MINER]The women of the Night Court. Prodigal daughters! Between December,1908, and December, 1909, no less than five thousand of them passedthrough the guarded door, under the blaze of the electric lights. Thereis never an hour, from nine at night until three in the morning, whenthe prisoners' bench in Jefferson Market Court is without its full quotaof women. Old--prematurely old, and young--pitifully young; white andbrown; fair and faded; sad and cynical; starved and prosper ous;rag-draped and satin-bedecked; together they wait their turn atjudgment.Quietly moving back and forth before the prisoners' bench you see awoman, tall, graceful, black-gowned. She is the salaried probationofficer, modern substitute for the old-time volunteer mission worker.The probation officer's serious blue eyes burn with no missionary zeal.There is no spark of sentimental pity in the keen gaze she turns on eachnew arrival.When the bench is full of women the judge turns to her to inquire:"Anybody there you want, Miss Miner?"Miss Miner usually shakes her head. She diagnoses her cases like aphysician, and she wastes no time on incurables.Once in a while, perhaps several times in the course of a night, MissMiner touches a girl on the arm. At once the girl rises and follows theprobation officer into an adjoining room. If she is what she appears,young in evil, if she has a story which rings true, a story of povertyand misfortune, rather than of depravity, she goes not back to theprisoners' bench. When her turn at judgment comes Miss Miner standsbeside her, and in a low voice meant only for the judge, she tells thefacts. The girl weeps as she listens. To hear one's troubles told issometimes more terrible than to endure them.Court adjourns at three in the morning, and this girl, with theothers--if others have been claimed by the probation officer--goes outinto the empty street, under the light of the tall tower, whose clockhas begun all over again its monotonous race toward midnight. Nopoliceman accompanies the group. The girls are under no manner ofduress. They have promised to go home with Miss Miner, and they go. Thenight's adventure, entered into with dread, with callous indifference,or with thoughtless mirth, ends in a quiet bedroom and a pillow wet withtears.[Illustration: IN THE NIGHT COURT, NEW YORK.]Waverley House, as Miss Miner's home is known, has sheltered, during thepast year, over three hundred girls. Out of that number one hundred andnineteen have returned to their homes, or are earning a living at usefulwork.One hundred and nineteen saved out of five thousand prodigals! In pointof numbers this is a melancholy showing, but in comparison with otherefforts at rescue work it is decidedly encouraging.Nothing quite like Waverley House has appeared in other American cities,but it is a type of detention home for girls which is developinglogically out of the probation system. Delinquent girls under sixteenare now considered, in all enlightened communities, subjects for theJuvenile Court. They are hardly ever associated with older delinquents.But a girl over sixteen is likely to be committed to prison, and may belocked in cells with criminal and abandoned women of the lowest order.Waverley House is the first practical protest against this stupid andevil-encouraging policy.The house, which stands a few blocks distant from the Night Court, wasestablished and is maintained by the Probation Association of New York,consisting of the probation officers in many of the city courts, and ofmen and women interested in philanthropy and social reform. The DistrictAttorney of New York County, Charles S. Whitman, is president of theAssociation, Maude E. Miner is its secretary, Mrs. Russell Sage, MissAnne Morgan, Miss Mary Dreier, president of the New York Women's TradeUnion League, Mrs. Richard Aldrich, formerly president of the Women'sMunicipal League, Andrew Carnegie, Edward T. Devine, head of New York'sorganized charities, Homer Folks, and Fulton Cutting are among thesupporters of Waverley House. Miss Stella Miner is the capable andsympathetic superintendent of the house.The place is in no sense a reformatory. It is an experiment station, alaboratory where the gravest and most baffling of all the diseases whichbeset society is being studied. Girls arrested for moral delinquency andparoled to probation officers are taken to Waverley House, where theyremain, under closest study and searching inquiry, until the best meansof disposing of them is devised. Some are sent to their homes, some tohospitals, some to institutions, some placed on long probation.Maude E. Miner, who declined a chair of mathematics in a woman's collegeto work in the Night Court, is one of an increasing number of women whoare attempting a great task. They are trying to solve a problem whichhas baffled the minds of the wisest since civilization dawned. They haveset themselves to combat an evil fate which every year overtakescountless thousands of young girls, dragging them down to misery,disease, and death. At the magnitude of the effort these women haveundertaken one stands appalled. Will they ever reach the heart of theproblem? Can they ever hope to do more than reclaim a few individuals?This much did the missionaries before them."We could reclaim fully seventy-five per cent," declares Miss Miner, "ifonly we could find a way to begin nearer the beginning."To begin the reform of any evil at the beginning, or near the beginning,instead of near the end is now regarded as an economy of effort. That iswhat educators are trying to do with juvenile delinquency; whatphysicians are doing with disease; what philanthropists are beginning todo with poverty.Hardly any one has suggested that the social evil might have a cause,and that it might be possible to attack it at its source. Yet that anylarge number of girls enter upon such a horrible career, willingly,voluntarily, is unbelievable to one who knows anything of the facts.There must be strong forces at work on these girls, forces they findthemselves entirely powerless to resist.Miss Miner and her fellow probation officers are the visible signs of avery important movement among women to discover what these forces are.Meager, indeed, are the facts at hand. We have had, and we still have,in cities east and west, committees and societies and law and orderleagues earnestly engaged in "stamping out" the evil. It is like tryingto stamp out a fire constantly fed with inflammables and fanned by astrong gale. The protests of most of these leagues amount to littlemore than vain clamor against a thing which is not even distantlycomprehended.The _personnel_ of these agencies organized to "stamp out" the evildiffers little in the various cities. It is largely if not whollymasculine in character, and the evil is usually dealt with from thepoint of view of religion and morals. Women, when they appear in thematter at all, figure as missionaries, "prison angels," and the like. Asevangelists to sinners women have been permitted to associate with theirfallen sisters without losing caste. Likewise, when elderly enough, theyhave been allowed to serve on governing boards of "homes" and"refuges." Their activities were limited to rescue work. They mightextend a hand to a repentant Magdalene. A Phryne they must not even beaware of. In other words, this evil as a subject of investigation andintelligent discussion among women was absolutely prohibited. It hasever been their Great Taboo.Nevertheless, when eight million women, in practically every civilizedcountry in the world, organized themselves into an International Councilof Women, and began their remarkable survey of the social order in whichthey live, one of their first acts was to break the Great Taboo.[Illustration: MISS SADIE AMERICAN]At early congresses of the International Council Miss Sadie American,Mrs. Kate Waller Barrett, Mrs. Elizabeth Grannis, among Americandelegates, Miss Elizabeth Janes of England, Miss Elizabeth Gad ofDenmark, Dr. Agnes Bluhm of Germany, and others interested in the moralwelfare of girls, urged upon the Council action against the "WhiteSlave" traffic. No extensive argument was required to convince themembers of the Council that the "White Slave" traffic and the wholesubject of the moral degradation of women was a social phenomenon toolong neglected by women.These women declared with refreshing candor that it was about time thatthe social evil was dealt with intelligently, and if it was to be dealtwith intelligently women must do the work. The fussy old gentlemen withwhite side whiskers and silk-stocking reformers and the other wellmeaning amateurs, who are engaged in "stamping out" the evil, deserve tobe set aside. In their places the women propose to install socialexperts who shall deal scientifically with the problem.The double standard of morals, accepted in fact if not in principle, inevery community, and so rigidly applied that good women are actuallyforbidden to have any knowledge of their fallen sisters, was for thefirst time repudiated by a body of organized women. The arguments onwhich the double standard of morals is based was, for the first time,seriously scrutinized by women of intelligence and social importance.The desirability of the descent of property in legal paternal lineseemed to these women a good enough reason for applying a rigid standardof morals to women. But they found reasons infinitely greater why thesame rigid standard should be applied to men.The International Council of Women and women's organizations in everycountry number among their members and delegates women physicians, andthrough these physicians they have been able to consider the social evilfrom an altogether new point of view. Certain very ugly facts, whichtouch the home and which intimately concern motherhood and the welfareof children, were brought forth--facts concerning infantile blindness,almost one-third of which is caused by excesses on the part of thefathers; facts concerning certain forms of ill health in married women,and the increase of sterility due to the spread of specific diseasesamong men. The horrible results to innocent women and children of thesemaladies, and their frightful prevalence,--seventy-five per cent of citymen, according to reliable authority, being affected,--aroused in thewomen a sentiment of indignation and revolt. The International Councilof Women put itself on record as protesting against the responsibilitylaid upon women, the unassisted task of preserving the purity of therace.In the United States, women's clubs, women's societies, women's medicalassociations, special committees of women in many cities havecourageously undertaken the study of this problem, intending by means ofinvestigation and publicity to lay bare its sources and seek its remedy.The sources of the evil are about the only phase of the problem whichhas never been adequately examined. It is true that we have suspectedthat the unsteady and ill-adjusted economic position of women furnishedsome explanation for its existence, but even now our information isvague and unsatisfactory.A number of years ago, in 1888 to be exact, the Massachusetts Bureau ofLabor Statistics made an interesting investigation. This was an effortto determine how far the entrance of women into the industrial world,usually under the disadvantage of low wages, was contributing toprofligacy. The bureau gathered statistics of the previous occupationsof nearly four thousand fallen women in twenty-eight American cities.Of these unfortunates over eight hundred had worked in low-waged tradessuch as paper-box making, millinery, laundry work, rope and cordagemaking, cigar and cigarette making, candy packing, textile factory andshoe factory work.About five hundred women had been garment workers, dressmakers, andseamstresses, but how far these were skilled or unskilled was notstated.The department store, at that time little more than a sweat shop so faras wages and long hours of work were concerned, contributed one hundredand sixteen recruits to the list.On the whole, these groups were what the investigators had expected tofind.There were two other large groups of prodigals, and these were entirelyunexpected by the investigators. Of the 3,866 girls examined 1,236, ornearly thirty-two per cent, reported no previous occupation. The nextlargest group, 1,115, or nearly thirty per cent, had been domesticservants. The largest group of all had gone straight from their homesinto lives of evil. A group nearly as large had gone directly from thatoccupation which is constantly urged upon women as the safest and mostsuitable means of earning their living--housework.Now you may, if you want to drop the thing out of your mind as somethingtoo disagreeable to think about, infer from this that at least sixty-twoper cent of those 3,866 women deserved their fate. Some of them were toolazy to work, and the rest preferred a life of soiled luxury to one ofhonest toil in somebody's nice kitchen. Apparently this was the viewtaken by the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor Statistics, because it nevercarried the investigation any farther. It never tried to find out _why_so many girls left their homes to enter evil lives. It never tried tofind out _why_ housework was a trade dangerous to morals.Fortunately it did occur to the women's organizations to examine thefacts a little more carefully. In this article I am going to take youover some of the ground they have covered and show you where theirinvestigations have led them.South Chicago is a fairly good place to begin. Its ugliness andforlornness can be matched in the factory section of almost any largecity. South Chicago is dominated by its steel mills,--enormous drabstructures, whose every crevice leaks quivering heat and whose toweringchimneys belch forth unceasingly a pall of ashes and black smoke. Thesteel workers and their families live as a rule in two and three familyhouses, built of wood, generally unpainted, and always dismallyutilitarian as to architectural details.In South Chicago, four years ago, there was not such a thing as a park,or a playground, or a recreation center. One lone social settlement wasjust seeking a home for itself. There were public schools, quiteimposing buildings. But these were closed and locked and shuttered forthe day as soon as the classes were dismissed.In a certain neighborhood of South Chicago there lived a number of younggirls, healthy, high-spirited, and full of that joy of life which alwaysmust be fed--if not with wholesome food, then husks. For parents thesegirls had fathers who worked twelve hours a day in the steel mills andcame home at night half dead from lack of rest and sleep; and motherswho toiled equally long hours in the kitchen or over the washtub andwere too weary to know or care what the girls did after school. Forsocial opportunity the girls had "going downtown." Perhaps you knowwhat that means. It means trooping up and down the main street in livelygroups, lingering near a saloon where a phonograph is bawling forth acheerful air, visiting a nickel theater, or looking on at a streetaccident or a fight.About this time the panic of 1907 descended suddenly on South Chicagoand turned out of the steel mills hundreds of boys and men. Some ofthese were mere lads, sixteen to eighteen years old. They, too, went"downtown." There was no other place for them to go.As a plain matter of cause and effect, what kind of a moral situationwould you expect to evolve out of these materials?Eventually a woman probation officer descended on the neighborhood. Manyof the girls whom she rescued from conditions not to be described inthese pages were so young that their cases were tried in the JuvenileCourt. Most of them went to rescue homes, reformatories, or hospitals.Some slipped away permanently, in all human probability to join thenever-ceasing procession of prodigals.This is what "no previous occupation" really means in nine cases out often. It means that the girl lived in a home which was no home at all,according to the ideals of you who read these pages.Sometimes it was a cellar where the family slept on rags. Sometimes itwas an attic where ten or twelve people herded in a space not largeenough for four. Some of these homes were never warm in winter. In somethere was hardly any furniture. But we need not turn to these extremecases in order to show that in many thousands of American homes virtueand innocence are lost because no facilities for preserving them arepossible.Annie Donnelly's case will serve as further illustration. AnnieDonnelly's father was a sober, decent man of forty, who drove a cab fromtwelve to fifteen hours every day in the year, Sundays and holidaysincluded. Before the cab drivers' strike, a year or two ago, Donnelly'swages were fifteen dollars a week, and the family lived in a four-roomtenement, for which they paid 5.50 a week. You pay rent weekly to atenement landlord. Since the strike wages are fourteen dollars a weekfor cab drivers, and this fall the Donnelly rent went up fifty cents aweek.The Donnelly tenement was a very desirable one, having but a singledark, windowless room, instead of two or three, like most New Yorktenements. There were three children younger than Annie, who wasfourteen. The family of five made a fairly tight fit in four rooms.Nevertheless, when the rent went up to six dollars Mrs. Donnelly took alodger. She had to or move and, remember, this was a desirable tenementbecause it had only one dark room.One day the lodger asked Annie if she did not want to go to a dance.Annie did want to, but she knew very well that her mother would notallow her to go. Once a year the entire family, including the baby,attended the annual ball of the Coachman's Union, but that was anotherthing. Annie was too young for dances her mother declared.The Donnellys paid for and occupied three rooms, but they really livedin one room, the others being too filled with beds to be habitableexcept at night. The kitchen, the one living-room, was uncomfortablycrowded at meal times. At no time was there any privacy. It wasimpossible for Annie to receive her girl friends in her home. Every bitof her social life had to be lived out of the house.When the weather was warm she often stayed in the street, walking aboutwith the other girls or sitting on a friend's doorstep, until ten oreven eleven o'clock at night. Every one does the same in a crowded cityneighborhood. There comes a time in a girl's life when this sort ofthing becomes monotonous. The time came when Annie found sitting on thedoorstep and talking about nothing in particular entirely unbearable. Soone balmy, inviting spring night she slipped away and went with thelodger to a dance.The dance hall occupied a big, low-ceiled basement room in a buildingwhich was a combination of saloon and tenement house. In one of thefront windows of the basement room was hung a gaudy placard: "The JohnnySullivan Social Club."The lodger paid no admission, but he deposited ten cents for a hatcheck, after which they went in. About thirty couples were swinging in awaltz, their forms indistinctly seen through the clouds of dust whichfollowed them in broken swirls through air so thick that the electriclights were dimmed. Somewhere in the obscurity a piano did its noisiestbest with a popular waltz tune.In a few minutes Annie forgot her timidity, forgot the dust and the heatand the odor of stale beer, and was conscious only that the music waspiercing, sweet, and that she was swinging in blissful time to it. Whenthe waltz tune came to an end at last the dancers stopped, gasping withthe heat, and swaying with the giddiness of the dance."Come along," said the lodger, "and have a beer." When Annie shook herhead he exclaimed: "Aw, yuh have to. The Sullivans gets the room rentfree, but the fellers upstairs has bar privileges, and yuh have to buya beer off of 'em oncet in a while. They've gotta get something out ofit."I do not know whether Annie yielded then or later. But ultimately shelearned to drink beer for the benefit of philanthropists who furnishdance halls rent free, and also to quench a thirst rendered unbearableby heat and dust. They seldom open the windows in these places.Sometimes they even nail the windows down. A well-ventilated room meanspoor business at the bar.Annie Donnelly became a dance-hall _habitue_. Not because she wasviciously inclined; not because she was abnormal; but because she wasdecidedly normal in all her instincts and desires.Besides, it is easy to get the dance-hall habit. At almost every danceinvitations to other dances are distributed with a lavish hand. Theseinvitations, on cheap printed cards, are scattered broadcast over chairsand benches, on the floors, and even on the bar itself. They are locallyknown as "throw-aways." Here are a few specimens, from which you mayform an idea of the quality of dance halls, and the kind ofpeople--almost the only kind of people--who offer pleasure to thestarved hearts of girls like Annie Donnelly. These are actualinvitations picked up in an East Side dance hall by the head worker ofthe New York College Settlement:     "_Second annual reception and ball, given by Jibo and Jack, at New     Starlight Hall, 143 Suffolk Street, December 25. Music by our     favorite. Gents ticket 25 cents, Ladies 15 cents._"     "_Don't miss the ball given by Joe the Greaser, and Sam Rosenstock,     at Odd Fellows' Hall, January 29th._"     "_See the Devil Dance at the Reception and Ball given by Max Pascal     and Little Whity, at Tutonia Hall, Tuesday evening, November     20th."_     _ "Reception and Ball given by two well known friends, Max Turk and     Sam Lande, better known as Mechuch, at Appollo Hall, Chrystmas     night. Floor manager, Young Louis. Ticket admit one 25 cents._"In addition to these private affairs which are arranged purely for theprofit of "Jibo and Jack" and their kind, men who make a living in thisand in yet more unspeakable ways, there are hundreds of saloon dancehalls, not only in New York, but in other cities. These are simplyannexes to drinking places, and people are not welcome there unless theydrink. No admission is charged.There are also numberless dancing academies. Dancing lessons are givenfour nights in the week, as a rule, and the dancing public buysadmission the other three nights and on Sunday afternoons. Some dancingacademies, even in tenement house quarters, are reputable institutions,but to most of them the lowest of the low, both men and women, resort.There, as in the dance halls, the "White Slaver" plies his trade, andthe destroyer of womanliness lays his nets.Annie Donnelly soon learned the ways of all these places. She learned to"spiel." You spiel by holding hands with your partner at arms' length,and whirling round and round at the highest possible speed. The girl'sskirts are blown immodestly high, which is a detail. The effect of thespiel is a species of drunkenness which creates an instant demand forliquor, and a temporary recklessness of the possible results of strongdrink.Annie also learned to dance what is known as the "half time," or the"part time" waltz. This is a dance accompanied by a swaying andcontorting of the hips, most indecent in its suggestion. It is really avery primitive form of the dance, and probably goes back to the paganharvest and bacchic festivals. You may see traces of it in certain crudepeasant dances in out-of-the-way corners of Europe. Now they teach it toimmigrant girls in New York dancing academies and dance halls, and tellthe girls that it is the _American_ fashion of waltzing.Annie Donnelly's destruction was accomplished in less than a year. Itwas the more rapid because of the really superior character of her home.There was nothing the matter with that home except that it was toocrowded for the family to stay in it. Father and mother wererespectable, hard-working people, and after Annie's first realmisadventure, into which she fell almost unwittingly, she was afraid togo home.The dance hall, as we have permitted it to exist, practicallyunregulated, has become a veritable forcing house of vice and crime inevery city in the United States. It is a straight chute down which,every year, thousands of girls descend to the way of the prodigal. Noone has counted their number. All we know of the unclassed is that theyexist, apparently in ever-increasing masses.It was estimated in Chicago, not long ago, that there were about sixthousand unfortunate women known to the police, and something liketwenty thousand who managed to avoid actual collision with the law. Thatis, the latter lived quietly and plied their trade on the street sounostentatiously that they were seldom arrested. How many of theseunfortunates reached the streets through the dance hall is impossible toknow--we only know that it constantly recruits the ranks of theunclassed.[Illustration: A DANCE HALL]The dance hall may be in the rear of a saloon, or over a saloon; it mayoccupy a vacant store building, or a large loft. Somewhere in itsimmediate vicinity there is a saloon. A dance lasts about five minutes,and the interval between dances is from ten to twenty minutes. Waiterscircle among the dancers, importuning them to drink. The dance hallwithout a bar, or some source of liquid supply, does not often exist,except as it has been established by social workers to offset theinfluence of the commercial dance hall.Some dance halls are small and wretchedly lighted. Others are large andpretentious. Some of them have direct connections with Raines Law hotelsand their prototypes. Of hardly a single dance hall can a good word besaid. They are almost entirely in the hands of the element lowest insociety, in business, and in politics.From the old-fashioned German family picnic park to Coney Island in NewYork, Revere Beach in Boston, The White City in Chicago, Savin Rock inNew Haven, and their like, is a far cry.Some of these summer parks try to keep their amusements clean anddecent, and some, notably Euclid Park, Cleveland, succeed. But drink andoften worse evils are characteristic of most of them. There are partsof Coney Island where no beer is sold, where the vaudeville and themoving pictures are clean and wholesome, where dancing is orderly. Butthe nearest side street has its "tough joint." The same thing is true ofthe big summer resorts of other cities.The dance hall, both winter and summer types, have had a deterioratingeffect upon the old-fashioned dancing academy. Formerly these wererespectable establishments where people paid for dancing lessons. Nowthey are a _melange_ of dancing classes and public entertainments. Thedancing masters, unable to compete with the dance hall proprietors, havebeen obliged to transfer many of the dance hall features to theirestablishments.Oddly enough it is rather an unusual thing for a girl to be escorted toa dance in any kind of a dance hall. The girls go alone, with a friend,or with a group of girls. The exceptional girl, who is attended by aman, must dance with him, or if she accepts another part ner, she mustask his permission. An escort is deemed a somewhat doubtful advantage.Those who go unattended are always sure of partners. Often they meet"fellows" they know, or have seen on the streets. Introductions are notnecessary. Even if a girl is unacquainted with any "fellows," if shepossesses slight attractions, she is still sure of partners.The amount of money spent by working girls for dance-hall admissions isconsiderable. A girl receiving six or seven dollars a week in wagesthinks nothing of reserving from fifty cents to a dollar for dancing.In going about among the dance halls one is struck with the number ofblack-gowned girls. The black gown might almost be called the mark ofthe dance-hall _habitue_, the girl who is dance mad and who spends allher evenings going from one resort to another. She wears black becauselight evening gowns soil too rapidly for a meager purse to renew.An indispensable feature of the dancing academy is the "spieler." Thisis a young man whose strongest recommendation is that he is a skilledand untiring dancer. The business of the spieler is to look after thewall-flowers. He seeks the girl who sits alone against the wall; hedances with her and brings other partners to her. It would not do for aplace to get the reputation of slowness. The girls go back to thosedance halls where they have had the best time.The spieler is not uncommonly a worthless fellow; sometimes he is asinister creature, who lives on the earnings of unfortunate girls. Thedance hall, and especially the dancing academy, because of the youth ofmany of its patrons, is a rich harvest field for men of this type.Beginning with the saloon dance hall, unquestionably the most brutallyevil type, and ending with the dancing academy, where some pretense ofchaperonage is made, the dance hall is a vicious institution. It isvicious because it takes the most natural of all human instincts, thedesire of men and women to associate together, and distorts thatinstinct into evil. The boy and girl of the tenement-dwelling classes,especially where the foreign element is strong, do not share theirpleasures in the normal, healthy fashion of other young people. Theposition of the women of this class is not very high. Men do not treather as an equal. They woo her for a wife. In the same manner the boydoes not play with the girl. The relations between young people veryreadily degenerate. The dance hall, with its curse of drink, its lack ofchaperonage and of reasonable discipline, helps this along its downwardcourse.Sadie Greenbaum, as I will call her, was an exceptionally attractiveyoung Jewish girl of fifteen when I first knew her. Although notremarkably bright in school she was industrious, and aspired to be astenographer. She was not destined to realize her ambition. As soon asshe finished grammar school she was served, so to speak, with herworking papers. The family needed additional income, not to meet actualliving expenses, for the Greenbaums were not acutely poor, but in orderthat the only son of the family might go to college. Max was seventeen,a selfish, overbearing prig of a boy, fully persuaded of his superiorityover his mother and sisters, and entirely willing that the family shouldtoil unceasingly for his advancement.Sadie accepted the situation meekly, and sought work in a muslinunderwear factory. At eighteen she was earning seven dollars a week as askilled operator on a tucking machine. She sat down to her work everymorning at eight o'clock, and for four hours watched with straining eyesa tucking foot which carried eight needles and gathered long strips ofmuslin into eight fine tucks, at the rate of four thousand stitches aminute. The needles, mere flickering flashes of white light above thecloth, had to be watched incessantly lest a thread break and spoil thecontinuity of a tuck. When you are on piece wages you do not relishstopping the machine and doing over a yard or two of work.So Sadie watched the needle assiduously, and ignored the fact that herhead ached pretty regularly, and she was generally too weary when lunchtime came to enjoy the black bread and pickles which, with a cup ofstrong tea, made her noon meal. After lunch she again sat down to hermachine and watched the needles gallop over the cloth.At the end of each year Sadie Greenbaum had produced for the good of thecommunity _four miles_ of tucked muslin. In return, the community hadrendered her back something less than three hundred dollars, for themuslin underwear trade has its dull seasons, and you do not earn sevendollars every week in the year.Each week Sadie handed her pay envelope unopened to her mother. Themother bought all Sadie's clothes and gave her food and shelter.Consequently, Sadie's unceasing vigil of the needle paid for herexistence and purchased also the proud consciousness of an older brotherwho would one day own a doctor's buggy and a social position.The one joy of this girl's life, in fact all the real life she lived,was dancing. Regularly every Saturday night Sadie and a girl friend,Rosie by name, put on their best clothes and betook themselves toSilver's Casino, a huge dance hall with small rooms adjoining, wherefood and much drink were to be had.There was a good floor at Silver's and a brass band to dance to. It wasgreat! The girls never lacked partners, and they made some veryagreeable acquaintances.In the dressing room, between dances, all the girls exchangedconversation, views on fashions, confidences about the young men andother gossip. Some of the girls were nice and some, it must be admitted,were "tough." What was the difference? The tough girls, with theirdaring humor, their cigarettes, their easy manners, and their amazinglysmart clothes, furnished a sort of spice to the affair.Sadie and Rosie sometimes discussed the tough girls, and theconversation nearly always ended with one remarking: "Well, if theydon't get anything else out of livin', look at the clothes they put ontheir backs."Perhaps you can understand that longing for pretty gowns, perhaps youcan even sympathize with it. Of course, if you have a number of otherresources, you can keep the dress hunger in its proper place. But if youhave nothing in your existence but a machine--at which you toil forothers' benefit;Sadie and Rosie continued to spend their Saturday evenings and theirSunday evenings at Silver's Casino. At first they went home togetherpromptly at midnight. After midnight these casino dance halls changetheir character. Often professional "pace makers" are introduced, menand women of the lowest class, who are paid to inspire the other dancersto lewd conduct. These wretched people are immodestly clothed, and theyperform immodest or very tough dances. They are usually known as"Twisters," a descriptive title. When they make their appearance theself-respecting dancers go home, and a much looser element comes in. Thepace becomes a rapid one. Manners are free, talk is coarse, laughter isincessant. The bar does a lively business. The dancing and the revels goon until daylight.The first time Sadie and Rosie allowed themselves to be persuaded tostay at Silver's after midnight they were rather horrified by theabandoned character of the dancing, the reckless drinking, and thefighting which resulted in several men being thrown out. The second timethey were not quite so horrified, but they decided not to stay so lateanother time. Then came a great social event, the annual "mask andshadow dance" of a local political organization. Sadie and Rosieattended.A "mask and shadow dance" is as important a function to girls of Sadie'sand Rosie's class as a cotillion is to girls of your class. Such affairsare possible only in large dance halls, and to do them impressivelycosts the proprietor some money. The guests rent costumes and masks andappear in very gala fashion indeed. They dance in the rays of all kindsof colored lights thrown upon them from upper galleries. During part ofa waltz the dancers are bathed in rose-colored lights, which changesuddenly to purple, a blue, or a green. Some very weird effects aremade, the lights being so manipulated that the dancers' shadows arethrown, greatly magnified, on walls and floor. At intervals a rain ofbright-colored confetti pours down from above. The scene becomesbacchanalian. Color, light, music, confetti, the dance, togethercombine to produce an intense and voluptuous intoxication which therevelers deepen with drink.The events of the latter part of that night were very vague in Sadie'smemory when she awoke late the next morning. She remembered that she hadtolerated familiarities which had been foreign to her experienceheretofore, and that she had been led home by some friendly soul, atdaylight, almost helpless from liquor.Frightened, haunted by half-ashamed memories of that dance, Sadiespoiled a good bit of her work on Monday morning. The forewomandescended on her with a torrent of coarse abuse, whereupon Sadie rosesuddenly from her machine, and in a burst of hysterical profanity andtears rushed out of the factory, vowing never to return. There was onlyone course, she decided, for her to take, and she took it."Sadie, why did you do it?" wailed Rosie the next time they met."It's better than the factory," said Sadie.Tucking muslin underwear is dull work, but it is, in most ways, a moreagreeable task than icing cakes in a St. Louis biscuit factory. All dayEdna M---- stood over a tank filled with thick chocolate icing. Thetable beside Edna's tank was kept constantly supplied with freshly baked"lady-fingers," and these in delicate handfuls Edna seized and plungedinto the hot ooze of the chocolate. Her arms, up to the elbows, wentinto the black stuff, over and over again all day. At noon, over theirlunch, the girls talked of their recreations, their clothes, their"fellows."Edna had not very much to contribute to the girls' stories of gayety andadventure. She led a quieter existence than most of the other girls,although her leanings were toward lively pleasures. She was engaged to ayoung man who worked in a foundry and who was steady and perhaps rathertoo serious. He was very jealous of Edna and exacted a stern degree offidelity of her.Before her engagement Edna had gone to a decent dancing school anddearly loved the dance. Now she was not permitted to dance with any onebut her prospective husband. The bright talk at the noon hour made Ednafeel that she was a very poor sport.The young man's work in the foundry alternated weekly between day andnight duty. It occurred to Edna that her young man could not possiblyknow what she did with those evenings he remained in the foundry. If shechose to go with a group of girls to a dance hall, what harm? The longyears of married life stretched themselves out somewhat drably to Edna.She decided to have a good time beforehand.This girl from now on literally lived a double life. Evenings of theweeks her young man was free from the foundry, she spent at home withhim, placidly playing cards, reading aloud, or talking. On the otherevenings she danced, madly, incessantly. Her mother thought she spentthe evenings with her girl friends. The dancing, plus the deceit, soonhad its effect on Edna. She began to visit livelier and livelierresorts, curious to see all phases of pleasure.Suspicion entered into the mind of her affianced. He questioned her;she lied, and he was unconvinced. A night or two later the young manstayed away from the foundry and followed Edna to a suburban resort. Shewent, as usual, with a group of girls, but their men were waiting forthem near the door of the open-air dancing pavilion. Standing justoutside, the angry lover watched the girl "spiel" round and round with aman of doubtful respectability. Soon she joined a noisy, beer-drinkinggroup at one of the tables, and her behavior grew more and morereckless. Finally, amid laughter, she and another girl performed asuggestive dance together.Walking swiftly up to her, the outraged foundryman grasped her by theshoulder, called her a name she did not yet deserve, and threw herviolently to the floor. A terrific fight followed, and the police sooncleared the place.Edna did not dare go home. An over-rigid standard of morals, anover-repressive policy, an over-righteous judgment, plus a motherignorant of the facts of life, plus a girl's longing for joy--the sum ofthese equaled ruin in Edna's case.CHAPTER VIIIWOMAN'S HELPING HAND TO THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTERAnnie, Sadie, Edna, thousands of girls like them, girls of whom almostidentical stories might be told, help to swell the long procession ofprodigals every succeeding year. They joined that procession ignorantlybecause they thirsted for pleasure. Their days were without interest,their minds were unfurnished with any resources. At fourteen most ofthem left public school. Reading and writing are about as muchintellectual accomplishments as the school gives them, and the workwaiting for them in factory, mill, or department store is rarely of acharacter to increase their intelligence.Ask a girl, "Why do you go to the dance hall? Why don't you stay homeevenings?" Nine times in ten her answer will be: "What should I do withmyself, sitting home and twirling my fingers?"If you suggest reading, she will reply: "You can't be reading all thetime." In other words, there is no intellectual impulse, but instead aninstinct for action.The crowded tenement, the city slum, an oppressive system of ill-paidlabor, these are evils which a gradually developing social consciencemust one day eliminate. Their tenure will not be disturbed to-day,to-morrow, or next day. Their evil influence can be offset, in somemeasure, by a recognition on the part of the community of a debt,--adebt to youth.The joy of life, inherent in every young creature, including the younghuman creature, seeks expression in play, in merriment, and will not bedenied.The oldest, the most persistent, the most attractive, the mostsatisfying expression of the joy of life is the dance. Other forms ofrecreation come in for brief periods, but their vogue is alwaystransitory. The roller skating craze, for example, waxed, waned, anddisappeared. Moving pictures and the nickelodeon have had their day, andare now passing. The charm, the passion, the lure of the dance remainsperennial. It never wholly disappears. It always returns.In New York City alone there are three hundred saloon dance halls. Threehundred dens of evil where every night in the year gallons of liquiddamnation are forced down the throats of unwilling drinkers! Wherethe bodies and souls of thousands of girls are annually destroyed,because the young are irresistibly drawn toward joy, and because we, allof us, good people, busy people, indifferent people, unseeing people,have permitted joy to become commercialized, have turned it into acommodity to be used for money profit by the worst elements in society.Could a more inverted scheme of things have been devised in a madhouse?New York is by no means unique. Every city has its dance hall problem;every small town its girl and boy problem; every country-side itstragedy of the girl who, for relief from monotony, goes to the city andnever returns.It is strange that nowhere, until lately, in city, town, or country, hasit occurred to any one that the community owed anything to thisinsatiable thirst for joy.Consider, for instance, the age-long indifference of the oldest of allguardians of virtue, the Christian Church. To the demand for joy theevangelical church has returned the stern reply: "To play cards, to goto the theater, above all, to dance, is wicked." The Methodist Church,for one, has this baleful theory written in its book of discipline, andpersistent efforts on the part of enlightened clergy and lay membershave utterly failed to expurgate it. The Catholic, Episcopalian, andLutheran churches utter no such strictures, but in effect they defendthe theory that joy, if not in itself an evil, at least is no necessityof life.To meet the growing social discontent, the increasing indifference toold forms of religion, the open dissatisfaction with religiousorganizations which had degenerated into clubs for rich men, there wasdeveloped some years ago in America the "institutional church." This wasan honest effort to give to church members, and to those likely tobecome church members, opportunity for social and intellectualdiversion. Parish houses and settlements were established, and thesewere furnished with splendid gymnasiums, club rooms, committee rooms,auditoriums for concerts and lectures, kitchens for cooking lessons, andprovision besides for basketry, sewing, and embroidery classes. Theseare all good, and so are the numberless reading, debating, and studyclubs good, as far as they go. But what a pitifully short way they go!They have built up congregations somewhat, but they have made not theslightest impression on the big social problem. The reason is plain. Theappeal of the institutional church is too intellectual. It reaches onlythat portion of the masses who stand least in need of socialopportunity.To this accusation the church, man instituted and man controlled sincethe beginning of the Christian Era, replies that it does all that canbe done for the uplift of humanity. That the church seems to be losingits hold on the masses of people is attributed to a general drift ofdegenerate humanity towards atheism and unbelief.The people, the great world of people,--what a field for the church towork in, if it only chose! The great obstacle is that the church(leaving out the institutional church), on Sunday a vital, living force,is content to exist all the other days in the week merely as a building.Six days and more than half six evenings in the week the churches standempty and deserted. Simply from the point of view of material economythis waste in church property, reduced to dollars and cents, wouldappear deplorable. From the point of view of social economy, reduced toterms of humanity, the waste is heartbreaking.What would happen if something should loose those churches, or, at anyrate, their big Sunday-school rooms and their ample basements from thisicy exclusiveness, this week-day aloofness from humanity? Can youpicture them at night, streaming with light, gay with music, filled withdancing crowds? not crowds from homes of wealth and comfort, but crowdsfrom streets and byways; crowds for which, at present, the underworldspreads its nets? The great mass of the people, packed in drearytenements, slaves of machinery by day, slaves of their own starved soulsby night, must go somewhere for relaxation and forgetfulness. What wouldhappen if the church should invite them, not to pray but to play?Some of the results might be a decrease in vice, in drinking, gambling,and misery. At least we may infer as much from the success of theoccasional experiments which have been tried. We have a few examples toprove that human nature is not the low, brutish thing it has too oftenbeen described. It does not invariably choose wrong ways, but, on thecontrary, when a choice between right ways and wrong ways is presented,the right is almost always preferred.A year ago in Chicago there was witnessed a spectacle which, for utterbrutality and blindness of heart, I hope never to see duplicated.Chicago had for some time been in the midst of a vigorous crusadeagainst organized vice. Too long neglected by the authorities and thepublic, the so-called levee districts of the city had fallen into thehands of grafting police officials, who, working with the lowest ofdegraded of men, had created an open and most brazen vice syndicate.Without going into details, it is enough to say that conditions finallybecame so scandalous that all Chicago rose in horror and rebellion. Thepolice department was thoroughly overhauled, and a new chief appointedwho undertook in all earnestness to suppress the worst features of thesystem. He had no new weapons it is true, and he probably had nonotion that he could make any impression on the evil of prostitution.But he might have restored external decency and order, and he mightpossibly have prepared the way for some scientific examination of theproblem. But a thing happened: one of those shocking blunders we toooften let happen. The efforts of the chief of police were set back,because of that blunder, no one can tell how far. A new hysteria of viceand disorder dates from the hour the blunder was made.In October of 1909 "Gypsy" Smith, a noted evangelical preacher of theitinerant order, was holding revival meetings in an armory on the SouthSide of Chicago. With mistaken zeal this man announced that he was goingdown into the South Side Levee and with one effort would reclaim everyone of the wretched inhabitants. He invited his immense congregation tofollow him there, and assist in the greatest crusade against vice theworld had ever seen.In Chicago, as in other cities, no procession or parade is allowed tomarch without permission from police headquarters. To the sorrow of allthose who believed that reform had really begun, Chief of Police Stewardissued a permit to "Gypsy" Smith. It is probable that the chief fearedthe effect of a refusal. To lift up the fallen has ever been one of thefunctions of religious bodies. Before issuing the permit, it is saidthat he used all his powers of persuasion against the parade.By orders from headquarters every house in the district was closed,shuttered, and pitch dark on the night of the parade. Every door waslocked, and the most complete silence reigned within. It was into acity of silence that the procession of nearly five thousand men, women,and young people of both sexes marched on that October midnight. In theglare of red fire and flaming torches, to the confused blare of manySalvation Army brass bands, the quavering of hymn tunes, including theclassic, "Where Is My Wandering Boy To-night," and the constantexplosion of photographers' flashlights, the long procession stumbledand jostled its way through streets that gave back for answer darknessand silence.But afterwards! The affair had been widely advertised, and it drew athrong of spectators, not only from every quarter of the city, but fromevery suburb and surrounding country town. Young men brought theirsweethearts, their sisters, to see the "show." As "Gypsy" Smith'sprocession wound its noisy way out of the district, and back into thearmory, this great mob of people surged into the streets prurientlyeager to watch the awakening of the levee. It came. Lights flashed up inalmost every house. The women appeared at the windows and even in thestreet. Saloon doors were flung open. The sound of pianos andphonographs rose above the clamor of the mob. Pandemonium broke loose asthe crowds flung themselves into the saloons and other resorts. Thepolice had to beat people back from the doors with their clubs. A riot,an orgy, impossible to describe, impossible to forget, ensued. Many ofthose who took part in it had never been in such a district before.This horrible scene somehow typified to my mind the whole blind,chaotic, senseless attitude which society has preserved toward the mostbaffling of all its problems. Nothing done to prevent the evil, becauseno one knew what to do. After the evil was an established fact, afterthe hearts of the victims were thoroughly hardened, after the last hopeof return had perished, then a "vice crusade"--led by a man!Another scene witnessed about the same time seems to me to typify thenew attitude which society--led by women--is assuming towards itsproblem. It was in the large kindergarten room of one of the oldest ofChicago's social centers,--the Ely Bates Settlement. A group of littleItalian girls, peasant clad in the red and green colors of their nativeland, swung around the room at a lively pace singing the familiar "SantaLucia." As the song ended the children suddenly broke into the maddestof dances, a tarantella. Led by a graceful young girl, one of thesettlement workers, they danced with the joyous abandon of youthfulspirits untrammeled, ending the dance with a chorus of happy laughter.This was only one group of many hundreds in every quarter ofChicago,--in schools, settlements, kindergartens, and othercenters,--who were rehearsing for the third of the annual playfestivals given out of doors each year in Chicago. The festivals areheld in the most spacious of the seventeen wonderful public gardens andplaygrounds established of late throughout the city. Lasting all day,this annual carnival of play is shared by school children, working girlsand boys, and young men and women. In the morning the children play andperform their costume dances. In the afternoon the fields are given upto athletic sports of older children, and in the evening young men andwomen, of all nationalities, many wearing their old-world peasantdresses, revive the plays and the dances of their native lands. Tens ofthousands view the beautiful spectacle, which each year excites moreinterest and assumes an added importance in the civic life of Chicago.Each of the large parks in Chicago's system is provided with a municipaldance hall, spacious buildings with perfect floors, good light, andventilation. Any group of young people are at liberty to secure a hall,rent free, for dancing parties. The city imposes only onecondition,--that the dances be chaperoned by park supervisors.Beautifully decorated with growing plants from the park greenhousesthese municipal dance halls are scenes of gayety almost every night inthe year. Park restaurants in connection with the halls furnish goodfood at low prices. Of course no liquor is sold. Nobody wants it. Thisis proved by the fact that saloon dance halls in the neighborhood of theparks have been deserted by their old patrons.Women have recognized the debt to youth and the joy of life, and theyare preparing to pay it.In this latest form of social service they have entered a battlefieldwhere the powers of righteousness have ever fought a losing fight. Menhave grappled with the social evil without success. They have laboredto discover a substitute for the saloon, and they have failed. They havetried to suppress the dance hall and they have failed. They have madelaws against evil resorts, and they have sent agents of the police toenforce their laws, but to no effect.The failure of the men does not dishearten or discourage the women whohave taken up the work. They believe that they have discovered analtogether new way in which to fight the social evil.They propose to turn against it its own most powerful weapons. The joyof life is to be fed with proper food instead of poison. Girls and youngmen are to be offered a chance to escape the nets stretched for them bythe underworld. In many cities women's clubs and women's societies areestablishing on a small scale amusement and recreation centers for youngpeople. In New York Miss Virginia Potter, niece of the late BishopPotter, and Miss Potter's colleagues in the Association of WorkingGirls' Clubs, have opened a public dance hall. The use of the largegymnasium of the Manhattan Trade School for Girls was secured, and everySaturday evening, from eight until eleven, young men and women come inand dance to excellent music, under the instruction, if they need it,of a skilled dancing-master. A small fee is charged, partly to defrayexpenses, and partly to attract a class of people who disdainphilanthropy and settlements. The experiment is new, but it isundoubtedly successful. As many as two hundred couples have beenadmitted in an evening. In half a dozen cities women's clubs and women'scommittees are at work on this matter of establishing amusement andrecreation centers for young people. In New York a Committee onAmusement and Vacation Resources of Working Girls has for its presidenta social worker of many years, Mrs. Charles M. Israels. Associated withthe committee are many other well-known social economists,--women ofwealth and influence who have given years to the service of workinggirls. The committee began its work by a scientific investigation intothe dance halls of New York, the summer parks and picnic grounds in theoutlying districts, and of the summer excursion boats which ply up anddown the Hudson River and Long Island Sound. The revelations made bythis investigation, carried on under the supervision of Miss JuliaSchoenfeld, were terrible enough. They were made to appear still moreterrible when it was known that men of the highest social and commercialstanding were profiting hugely from the most vicious forms ofamusement. A state senator is one of the largest stockholders in ConeyIsland resorts of bad character. An ex-governor of the State controls apopular excursion boat, on which staterooms are rented by the hour, forimmoral purposes no one can possibly doubt. The women of the committeesubmitted the findings of their investigators to the managers of theseamusement places and to the directors of the steamboat lines, and inmany instances reforms have been promised. The point is that a committeeof women had to finance an investigation to show these business men theconditions which were adding to their wealth, and into which they hadnever even inquired.Another investigation made by the committee revealed the meagerness ofthe provision made by churches, settlements, and business establishmentsfor working girls' vacations. There are, in round numbers, four hundredthousand working women in Greater New York. Of these, something likethree hundred thousand are unmarried girls between the ages of fourteenand thirty. In all, only 6,874 of these young toilers, who earn on anaverage six dollars a week, are provided with vacation outings. They areusually given vacations, with or without pay, but they spend the idletime at Coney Island, on excursion boats, or in the dance hall.Of the 1,257 churches and synagogues of New York, only six reportorganized vacation work for girls and women. Of the twenty or more largedepartment stores, employing thousands of women, only three havevacation houses in the country. Of the hundred or more socialsettlements in New York only fifteen provide summer homes. There areseveral vacation societies which do good work with limited resources,but they are able to care for comparatively few. We have heard much offresh air work for children, and we can afford to hear more. But thatthe fresh air work for young girls and women who toil long hours infactory and shop must be extended, this committee's investigationdefinitely establishes.The first practical work of the committee, after the investigation ofamusement and recreation places, was a bill introduced into the StateLegislature providing for the licensing and regulation of public dancingacademies, prohibiting the sale of liquor in such establishments, andholding the proprietor responsible for indecent dancing and improperbehavior.Against the bitter opposition of the dancing academy proprietors thebill became a law and went into effect in September, 1909. Almostimmediately it was challenged on constitutional grounds. The committeepromptly introduced another bill, this one to regulate dance halls.This bill, which passed the legislature and is now a law, aims to wipeout the saloon dance hall absolutely, and so to regulate the sale ofliquor in all dancing places that the drink evil will be cut down to aminimum. The license fee of fifty dollars a year will eliminate thelowest, cheapest resorts, and a rigid system of inspection will not onlygo far towards preserving good order, but will do away with thewretchedly dirty, ill-smelling, unsanitary fire traps in which manyhalls are located. The dance-hall proprietor who encourages or eventolerates "tough" dancing, or who admits to the floor "White Slavers,"procurers, or persons of open immorality, will be liable to forfeitureof his license.The committee has done more than try to reform existing dance halls. Ithas taken steps to establish, in neighborhoods where evil resortsabound, attractive dance halls, where a decent standard of conduct iscombined with all the best features of the evil places--good floors,lively music, bright lights. Two corporations have been organized forthe maintenance, in various parts of the city, of model dance halls, andone hall has already been opened. The patrons of the model dance hall donot know that it is a social experiment paid for by a committee ofwomen. It is run exactly like any public dancing place, only in anorderly fashion.Every extension of use of public places, schools, parks, piers, asrecreation places for young people between fifteen and twenty isencouraged and supported by the committee. Already two public schoolshave organized dancing classes, and several settlements have thrown opentheir dances to the public where formerly they were attended only bysettlement club members.By helping working girls to find cheap vacation homes in the country,and by establishing vacation banks to help the girls save for theirsummer outings, the committee hopes to discourage some of the haphazardpicnic park dissipation. In summer many trades are slack, girls areidle, and out of sheer boredom they hang around the parks seekingamusement. It is only a theory, perhaps, but Mrs. Israels and the otherson her committee believe that if many of these girls knew that a countryvacation were within the possibilities, they would gladly save moneytowards it. At present the vacation facilities of working girls in largecities are small. In New York, where at least three hundred thousandgirls and women earn their bread, only about six thousand are helped tosummer vacations in the country. What these women are doing now on asmall scale, experimentally, will soon be adopted, as their children'splaygrounds, their kindergartens, their vacation schools, and otherenterprises have been adopted, by the municipalities. Their probationofficers, long paid out of club treasuries, have already beentransferred to many cities, east and west. Soon municipal dance halls,municipal athletic grounds, municipal amusement and recreation centersfor all ages and all classes will be provided.Already New York is preparing for such a campaign. The newly-appointedParks Commissioner, Charles B. Stover, looking over his office force,dismissed one secretary whose function seemed largely ornamental, anddiverted his salary of four thousand dollars to recreation purposes foryoung people. Commissioner Stover desires the appointment of a cityofficer who shall be a Supervisor of Recreations, a man or a woman whoseentire time shall be devoted to discovering where recreation parks,dancing pavilions, music, and other forms of pleasure are needed, andhow they may be made to do the most good. A neighborhood that thirstsfor concerts ought to have them. A community that desires to dancedeserves a dance hall. In the long run, how infinitely better, how muchmore economical for the city to furnish these recreations, normally anddecently conducted, than to bear the consequences of an order of thingslike the present one. The new order must come. It is the only way yetpointed out by which we may hope to close those other avenues, where thejoy of youth is turned into a cup of trembling, and the dancing feet ofgirlhood are led into mires of shame.CHAPTER IXTHE SERVANT IN HER HOUSEAccording to the findings of the Massachusetts State Bureau of LaborStatistics, whose investigation into previous occupation of fallen womenwas described in a former chapter, domestic service is a dangeroustrade. Of the 3,966 unfortunates who came under the examination of theBureau's investigators, 1,115, or nearly thirty per cent, had been indomestic service. No other single industry furnished anything like thisproportion.From time to time reformatories and institutions dealing with delinquentwomen and girls examine the industrial status of their charges, alwayswith results which agree with or even exceed the Massachusettsstatistics. Bedford Reformatory, one of the two New York Stateinstitutions for delinquent women, in an examination of a group of onethousand women, found four hundred and thirty general houseworkers,twenty-four chamber-maids, thirteen nursemaids, eight cooks, andthirty-six waitresses. As some of the waitresses may have beenrestaurant workers, we will eliminate them. Even so, it will be seenthat four hundred and seventy-five--nearly half of the Bedfordwomen--had been servants.In 1908 the Albion House of Refuge, New York, admitted one hundred andsixty-eight girls. Of these ninety-two were domestics, one was a lady'smaid, and nine were nursemaids.Of one hundred and twenty-seven girls in the Industrial School atRochester, New York, in 1909, only fifty-one were wage earners. Of thatnumber twenty-nine had worked in private homes as domestics. BedfordReformatory receives mostly city girls; Albion and Rochester aresupplied from small cities and country towns. It appears that domesticservice is a dangerous trade in small communities as well as in largeones.On the face of it, the facts are wonderfully puzzling. Domestic serviceis constantly urged upon women as the safest, healthiest, most normalprofession in which they can possibly engage. Assuredly it seems topossess certain unique advantages. Domestic service is the only field ofindustry where the demand for workers permanently exceeds the supply.The nature of the work is essentially suited, by habit, tradition, andlong experiment, to women. It offers economic independence within theshelter of the home.Lastly, housework pays extremely well. A girl totally ignorant of theart of cooking, of any household art, one whose function is to clean,scrub, and assist her employer to prepare meals, can readily command tendollars a month, with board. The same efficiency, or lack of efficiency,in a factory or department store would be worth about ten dollars amonth, without board. The wages of a competent houseworker, in any partof the country, average over eighteen dollars a month. Add to this aboutthirty dollars a month represented by food, lodging, light, and fire,and you will see that the competent houseworker's yearly income amountsto five hundred and seventy-six dollars. This is a higher average thanthe school-teacher or the stenographer receives; it is almost double theaverage wage of the shop girl, or the factory girl. It is, in fact,about as high as the usual income of the American workingman.It is true that the social position of the domestic worker is lower thanthat of the teacher, stenographer, or factory worker. This undoubtedlyaffects the attractiveness of domestic service as a profession. But thelower social position is in itself no explanation of the high rate ofimmorality. At least there are no figures to prove that the rate ofmorality rises or falls with the social status of the individual.In the contemplation of what is known as the "servant problem," I thinkwe have been less scientific and more superficial than in any othersocial or industrial problem. For the increasing dearth of domesticworkers, for the lowered standard of efficiency, for the startlingamount of immorality alleged to belong to the class, we have given everyexplanation except the right one.At the bottom of the "servant problem" lies the fact that it exists inthe privacy of the home. Now, we have reached a point of socialconsciousness where we allow that it is right to intrude some homes andask questions for the good of the community. "How many children haveyou?" "Are they all in school?" "Does your husband drink?" We have notyet reached the point of sending agents to inquire: "How many servantsdo you keep; what are their hours of work, and what kind of sleepingaccommodations do you furnish them?"Some intelligent inquiry has been made into surface conditions. TheSociological Department of Vassar College, under Professor Lucy MaynardSalmon, during the years 1889 and 1890, made an exhaustive study ofwages, hours of work, difficulties, advantages, and disadvantages ofdomestic service. Professor Salmon's book, "Domestic Service," givingthe results of the inquiry, is a classic on the subject. It deals,however, almost entirely with the ethical side of the problem, thesocial relation between mistress and maid. The relation between theworker and the industry is hardly examined at all.A later inquiry into the servant problem was conducted in 1903, in halfa dozen cities, by organizations of women which associated themselvesfor the purpose, under the name of the Intermunicipal Committee onHousehold Research.The Woman's Municipal League of New York, the Educational and IndustrialUnion of Boston, the Housekeepers' Alliance, and the Civic Club ofPhiladelphia were the moving elements in the investigation. Co-operatingwith them were the College Settlements Association and theAssociation of Collegiate Alumnae, which together established ascholar ship for the research. This research was most ably conducted byMiss Frances Kellor, a Vassar graduate, and nine assistant workers, allof whom were college women. The report of the investigation waspublished a year later in the volume "Out of Work."[1]This investigation by organizations of educated and expert women was thefirst survey ever made of domestic service _as an industry_, the firstscientific study of domestic workers _as an industrial group_. It wasthe first intelligent attempt to review housework as if it were a trade.The most important conclusion of the investigators was that housework,domestic service, although carried on as a trade, is really no trade atall. The domestic worker is no more a part of modern industry than theItalian woman who finishes "pants" in a tenement, or the child who staysfrom school to fasten hooks and eyes on paper cards.Do not let us make a mistake concerning the underlying cause of theservant problem. Let us face the truth that we have two institutionswhich are back numbers in twentieth century civilization: two left-oversfrom a past-and-gone domestic system of industry. One of these is thetenement sweat shop, where women combine, or try to combine,manufacturing and housekeeping. The other is the private kitchen--thehome--where the last stand of conservatism and tradition, the lastlingering remnant of hand labor, continues to exist.No woman who is free enough, strong enough, intelligent enough to seekwork in a factory or shop, is ever found in a sweat shop or seencarrying bundles of coats to finish at home.Exactly for the same reason the average American working woman shunshousework as a means of livelihood. You will find in every community afew women of intelligence who are naturally so domestic in their tastesand inclinations that they shrink from any work outside the home. Suchwomen do adhere to domestic service, but, broadly speaking, you beholdin the servant group merely the siftings of the real industrial class.In a tentative, halting sort of fashion we are learning to humanize thefactory and shop. Factory workers, mill hands, department store clerks,have been granted legislation in almost every State of the Union,regulating hours of work, sanitary conditions, ventilation, and in somecases they have been given protection from dangerous machinery. Indepartment stores they have been granted even certain special comforts,such as seats on which to rest while not actually working.Of course, we have done no more than make a beginning in this matter ofhumanizing the factory and the shop. But we have made a beginning, andthe movement toward securing better and juster and healthier conditionsfor workers in all the industries is bound to continue. So long asmanufacturing was carried on in the home, no such protective legislationas workers now enjoy was dreamed of. We had to wait until the workerscame together in large groups before we could see their conditions andunderstand their needs.Housework, because it is performed in isolation, because it is purelyindividual labor, has never been classed among the industries. It hasrather been looked upon as a normal feminine function, a form of healthyexercise. No one has ever suggested to legislators that sweeping andbeating rugs might be included among the dusty trades; that bending oversteaming washtubs, and almost immediately afterwards going out intofrosty air to hang the clothes, might be harmful to throat and lungs;that remaining within doors days at a time, as houseworkers almostinvariably do, reacts on nerves and the entire physical structure; thatsteady service, if not actual labor, from six in the morning until nineand ten at night makes excessive demands on mind and body.Such conditions exist because the workers are too weak, too inefficient,too unintelligent to change them. Yet the demand for servants so farexceeds the supply that they are in a position, theoretically, todictate the terms of their own employment. If they elected to demandpianos and private baths they could get them; that is, if instead ofremaining isolated individuals they could form themselves into anindustrial class, like plumbers, or bricklayers, or carpenters. Even asisolated individuals they are able to command a better money wage thanmore efficient workers, which proves how great is the need for theirservices.The housekeeper clings to her archaic kitchen, firmly believing that ifshe gave it up, tried to replace it by any form of co-operative living,the pillars of society would crumble and the home pass out of existence.Yet so strong is her instinctive repugnance to the medieval system onwhich her household is conducted, that she shuns it, runs away from itwhenever she can. Housekeeping as a business is a dark mystery to her.The mass of women in the United States probably hold, almost as anarticle of religion, the theory that woman's place is in the home. Butthe woman who can organize and manage a home as her husband manages hisbusiness, systematically, profitably, professionally--well, how manysuch women do you know?It would seem as if in the newer generations, the average housekeeper isnot in the professional class at all. Usually she lacks professionaltraining. If she was brought up in a well-to-do home where there wereseveral servants, she knows literally nothing of cooking, or of anydepartment of housekeeping. Even when she has had some instruction inhousehold tasks, she almost never connects cooking with chemistry, foodwith dietetics, cleanliness with sanitation, buying with bookkeeping.She is an amateur. And she takes into her household to do work sheherself is incapable of doing, another amateur, a woman who might, inmany cases, do well under a capable commander, but who is hopelessly atsea when expected to evolve a system of housekeeping all by herself.This irregular state of affairs in what should be a carefully studied,well-organized industry is reflected in the conditions commonly metedout to domestics. Take housing conditions, for example. Somehousekeepers provide their servants with good beds; of course, not quiteas good as other members of the household enjoy, but good enough. Someset aside pleasant, warm, well-furnished rooms for the servants. ButMiss Kellor's investigators reported that it was common to find the onlyunheated room in a house or apartment set aside for the servant. Theyfound great numbers of servants' rooms in basements, having no sunlightor heat.At one home, where an investigator applied for a "place," thehousekeeper complained that her last maid was untidy. Then she showedthe applicant to the servant's room. This was a little den partitionedoff from the coal bin!In another place, the maid was required to sleep on an ironing boardplaced over the bathtub. In still another, the maid spent her night ofrest on a mattress laid over the wash tubs in a basement. A bed for twoservants, consisting of a thin mattress on the dining-room table, wasalso found.Unventilated closets, rooms opening off from the kitchen, small andwindowless, are very commonly provided in city flats. Even in spaciouscountry homes the servants' rooms are considered matters of littleimportance."One woman," writes Miss Kellor, "planned her new three-story house withthe attic windows so high that no one could see out of them. When thearchitect remonstrated she said: 'Oh, those are for the maids; I don'texpect them to spend their time looking out.'"I remember a young girl who waited on table at a woman's hotel where Imade my home. One morning I sent this girl for more cream for my coffee.She was gone some time and I spoke to her a little impatiently when shereturned. She was silent for a moment, then she said: "Do you know thatevery time you send me to the pantry it means a walk of three and a halfblocks? This dining-room and the kitchens and pantries are a blockapart, and are separated by three flights of stairs. I have counted thedistance there and back, and it is more than three blocks.""But, Kittie," I said to her, "why do you work in a hotel, if it's likethat? Why don't you take a place in a private family?""I've tried that," said the girl. "I had a place with the ----family,"mentioning an historic name. "They had sickness in the family, and theystopped in town all summer. My room was up in the attic, with only askylight for ventilation. During the day, except for the time I spentsitting on the area steps after nine o'clock, I was waiting on the cookin a hot kitchen. They let me out of the house once every two weeks.Here I have some freedom, at least."I have told this story to dozens of domestics, many of them from homesof wealth, and they agree that it is a common case. It is very rare,these girls say, to find a mistress who is willing to allow her maids toleave the house except on their days out. They concede certain hours ofrest, it is true, but those hours must be spent within doors. "Why, ifyou went out I should be sure to need you," is the usual explanation.Imagine a factory girl or a stenographer being required to remain afterhours on the chance of being needed for extra work.There is an aspect to this phase of the servant question which isgenerally overlooked by employers. This is an isolation from humanintercourse to be found in no other industry. When the household employsonly one servant the isolation is absolute. The girl is marooned, withinfull sight of others' happy life. Even when kindness is her portion sheis an outsider from the family circle. Important as her function is inthe life of the household, she is socially the lowest unit in it.During the course of a great strike of mill operatives in Fall River,Massachusetts, a few years ago, a considerable group of weaver andspinner girls were induced, by members of the Women's Trade UnionLeague, to take up domestic service until the close of the strike. Asthe girls were in acute financial distress they agreed to try theexperiment. These were mostly American or English girls, some of themabove the average of intelligence and good sense.Housework with its great variety of tasks made severe draughts on thestrength of girls accustomed to using one set of muscles. The long hoursand the confinement of domestic service affected nerves adjusted to alegal fifty-eight-hour week.But the girls' real objection to housework was its loneliness. Hardly asingle house in Boston, or the surrounding suburbs, where the girlsfound places, was provided with a servants' sitting room. There wasabsolutely no provision made for callers. For a servant is supposed notto have friends except on her days out. On those occasions she isassumed to meet her friends on the street.In England people recognize the fact that they have a servant class.Every house of any pretentions provides a servants' hall.In the United States a sitting room for servants, even in millionaires'homes, is a rarity.More than this, in many city households, especially in apartmenthouseholds, the servants are prohibited from receiving their friendseven in the kitchen. "Are we allowed to receive men visitors in thehouse?" chorused a group of girls, questioned in a fashionableemployment agency. "Mostly our friends are not allowed to step insidethe areaway while we are putting on our hats to go out."There is no escaping the conclusion that a large part of the socialevil, or that branch of it recruited every year from domestic service,is traceable to American methods of dealing with servants. The domestic,belonging, as a rule, to a weak and inefficient class, is literallydriven into paths where only strength and efficiency could possiblyprotect her from evil.Servants share, in common with all other human beings, the necessity forhuman intercourse. They must have associates, friends, companions. Ifthey cannot meet them in their homes they must seek them outside.Walk through the large parks in any city, late in the evening, andobserve the couples who occupy obscurely placed benches. You pity themfor their immodest behavior in a public place. But most of them have noother place to meet. And it is not difficult to comprehend thatclandestine appointments in dark corners as a rule do not conduce toproper behavior. Most of the women you see on park benches are domesticservants. Some of them, it is safe to assume, work in New York'sFifth Avenue, or in mansions on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive.[Illustration: AN UNTHOUGHT-OF PHASE OF THE SERVANT QUESTION]The social opportunity of the domestic worker is limited to the parkbench, the cheap theater, the summer excursion boat, and the dance hall.Hardly ever does a settlement club admit a domestic to membership;rarely does a working girls' society or a Young Women's ChristianAssociation circle bid her welcome. The Girls' Friendly Association ofthe Protestant Episcopal Church is a notable exception to this rule.In a large New England city, not long ago, a member of the Woman's Clubproposed to establish a club especially for domestics, since no otherclass of women seemed willing to associate with them. The proposal wasvoted down. "For," said the women, "if they had a clubroom they would besure to invite men, and immorality might result."But there is no direct connection between a clubroom and immorality,whereas the park bench after dark and the dance hall and its almostinvariable accompaniment of strong drink are positive dangers.The housekeeper simply does not realize that her domestics are _girls_,exactly like other girls. They need social intercourse, they needlaughter and dancing and healthy pleasure just as other girls need them,as much as the young ladies of the household need them.Perhaps they need them even more. The girl upstairs has mental resourceswhich the girl downstairs lacks. The girl upstairs has the protectionof family, friends, social position. The last is of greatest importance,because the woman without a social position has ever been regarded by alarge class of men as fair game. The domestic worker sometimes findsthis out within the shelter, the supposed shelter, of her employer'shome.[Illustration: ANOTHER SERIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE SOCIAL QUESTION]Tolstoy's terrible story "Resurrection" has for its central anecdote inthe opening chapter a court-room scene in which a judge is called uponto sentence to prison a woman for whose downfall he had, years before,been responsible. A somewhat similar story in real life, with a happierending, was told me by the head of a woman's reformatory. This officialreceived a visit from a lawyer, who told her with much emotion that hehad, several days before, been present when a young girl was sentencedto a term in a reformatory."She lived in my home," said the man. "I believe that she was a goodgirl up to that time. My wife died, my home was given up, and of courseI forgot that poor girl. She never made any claim on me. When I saw herthere in court, among the dregs of humanity, her face showing what herlife had become, I wanted to shoot myself. Now she is here, with achance to get back her health and a right state of mind. Will you helpme to make amends?"The head of the reformatory rather doubted the man's sincerity at first.She feared that his repentance was superficial. She refused to allowhim to see or to communicate with the girl, but she wrote him regularlyof her progress. Several times in the course of the year the man visitedthe reformatory, and at the end of that period he was allowed to see thegirl. This institution happens to be one of the few where a rational anda humane system of outdoor work is in vogue. The girl, who a year backhad been almost a physical wreck from drugs and the life of the streets,was again strong, healthy, and sane. The two forgave each other and weremarried.If the position of the domestic, while living in the shelter of afamily, is sometimes precarious, her situation, when out of a job, isoften actually perilous.If a girl has a home she goes to that home, and regards her temporaryperiod of unemployment as a pleasant vacation. But in most cases, incities, at any rate, few girls have homes of which they can availthemselves."In no city," says Miss Kellor's report, "are adequate provisions madefor such homeless women, and their predicament is peculiarly acute, fortheir friends are often household workers who cannot extend thehospitality of their rooms."I think I hear a chorus of protesting voices: "We don't have anythingto do with the servant class you are describing. Our girls arerespectable. They meet their friends at church. They come to us fromreputable employment offices, which would not deal with them if theywere not all right."Are you sure you know this? What, after all, do you really know aboutyour servants? What do you know about the employment office that senther to you? What do you know of the world inhabited by servants and thepeople who deal in servants? Can you not imagine that it might bedifferent from the one you live in so safely and comfortably?Are you willing to know the facts about the world, the underworld, fromwhich the girl who cooks your food and takes care of your children isdrawn? Do you care to know how a domestic spends the time betweenplaces, how she gets to your kitchen or nursery, the kind of homes shemay have been in before she came to you? Make a little descent into thatunderworld with a girl whose experience is matched with those of manyothers.Nellie B---- was an Irish girl, strong, pretty of face, and joyful oftemperament. The quiet Indiana town where she earned her living as acook offered Nellie so little diversion that she determined to go toChicago to live. She gave up her place, and with a month's wages in herpocket went to the city.It was late in the afternoon when her train reached the station. Nelliealighted, bewildered and lonely. She had the address of an employmentagency, furnished her by an acquaintance. Nellie slept that night, orrather tossed sleepless in the agency lodging house, on a dirty bedoccupied by two women besides herself. In all her life she had neverbeen inside such a filthy room, or heard such frightful conversation.Therefore next morning she gladly paid her exorbitant bill of one dollarand seventy-five cents, besides a fee of two dollars and a half forobtaining employment, and accepted the first place offered her.The house she was taken to seemed to be conducted rather strangely.Meals were at unusual hours, and the household consisted largely ofyoung women who received many men callers. For about a week Nellie didher work unmolested. At the end of the week her mistress presented herwith a low-necked satin dress and asked her if she would not like toassist in entertaining the men. Simple-minded Nellie had to have thenature of the entertaining explained to her, and she had greatdifficulty in leaving the house after she had declined the offer. Shehad hardly any money left, and the woman refused to pay her for herweek's work.Nellie knew of no other employment agency, so she was obliged to returnto the one she left. When she reproached the agent for sending her to adisreputable house he shrugged his shoulders and replied: "Well, I sendgirls where they're wanted. If they don't like the place they canleave."The fact is, they cannot always leave when they want to. Miss Kellor'sinvestigators found an office in Chicago which sent girls to a resort inWisconsin which was represented as a summer hotel. This notorious placewas surrounded by a high stockade which rendered escape impossible.The investigators found offices in other cities which operatedisreputable houses in summer places. To these the proprietors send thehandsomest of their applicants for honest work.Three girls sent to a house of this kind found themselves prisoners. Onegirl made such a disturbance by screaming and crying that the proprietorliterally kicked her out of the house. The investigators for theIntermunicipal Committee on Household Research saw this girl in ahospital, insane and dying from the treatment she had received. Anotherof the three escaped from the place. She, too, was discovered in a stateof dementia. The fate of the third girl is obscure.[Illustration: THE SERVANT GIRL AND THE EMPLOYMENT AGENCY]Not all employment agencies cater to this trade. Not all would consentto be accessory to women's degradation. But the employment agencybusiness, taken by and large, is disorganized, haphazard, out of date.It is operated on a system founded in lies and extortion. The officeswant fees--fees from servants and fees from employers. They encourageservants to change their employment as often as possible. Often a firmwill send a girl to a place, and a week or two later will send her wordthat they have a better job for her. Sometimes they arrange with her toleave her place after a certain period, promising her an easier positionor a better wage. They favor the girl who changes often. "You're a nicekind of a customer!" jeered one proprietor to a girl who boasted thatshe had been in a family for five years. The girl was a _customer_ tohim, and she was nothing more.To his profitable customer the agent is often very accommodating. If shelacks references he writes her flattering ones, or loans her a referencewritten by some woman of prominence. References, indeed, are oftenhanded around like passports among Russian revolutionists.Many of these unpleasant facts were brought to light in the course ofthe investigation made by the Intermunicipal Committee on HouseholdResearch. The result of their report was a model employment agency law,passed by the New York State Legislature, providing for a strictlicensing system, rigid forms of contract, regulation of fees, andinspection by special officers of the Bureau of Licenses. The lawapplies only to cities of the first class, and unfortunately has neverbeen very well enforced. Perhaps it has not been possible to enforce it.In all the cities examined by the Intermunicipal Committee on HouseholdResearch the investigators found the majority of employment agencies inclose connection with the homes of the agents. In New York, of threehundred and thirteen offices visited, one hundred and twenty were intenements, one hundred and seven in apartment houses, thirty-nine inresidences and only forty-nine in business buildings. InPhiladelphia, only three per cent of employment agencies were foundin business buildings. Chicago made a little better showing, withnineteen per cent in business houses. The difficulty of properlyregulating a business which is carried on in the privacy of a home isapparent. When an agency is in a business building it usually hasconspicuous signs, and often the rooms are well equipped with desks,comfortable chairs, and other office furnishings. But the majority ofagencies are of another description. Those dealing with immigrant girlsare sometimes filthy rooms in some rear tenement, reached through asaloon or a barber shop facing the street. Often the other tenants ofthe building are fortune tellers, palmists, "trance mediums," and likeundesirables.A large number of these agencies operate lodging houses for theirpatrons. There is hardly a good word to say for most of these, exceptthat they are absolutely necessary. Dirty, unsanitary, miserable as theyusually are, if they were closed by law, hundreds, perhaps thousands ofdomestics temporarily out of work, would be turned into the streets.Many are unfamiliar with the cities they live in. Many more are barredfrom hotels on account of small means. Often a girl finding itimpossible to bring herself to lie down on the wretched beds provided bythese lodging houses, leaves her luggage and goes out, not to returnuntil morning. She spends the night in dance halls and other resorts.According to Miss Kellor's report this description of employmentagencies and lodging houses attached to them applies to aboutseventy-five per cent of all offices in the four cities examined. Forgreater accuracy the investigators made a brief survey of conditions incities, such as St. Louis, New Haven, and Columbus, Ohio. Thedifferences were slight, showing that the employment agency problem ismuch the same east and west.Domestic servants have their industrial ups and downs like otherworkers. Sometimes they are able to pay the fees required in ahigh-class employment office, while at other times they are obliged tohave recourse to the cheaper places, where standards of honesty, andperhaps also, of propriety, are low. Domestic workers are the nomads ofindustry. Their lives are like their work,--impermanent, detached fromothers', unobserved.It is for the housekeepers of America to consider the plain factsconcerning domestic service. Some of the conditions they can change.Others they cannot. No one can alter the economic status of the kitchen.Like the sweat shop, it must ultimately disappear.What system of housekeeping will take the place of the present systemcannot precisely be foretold. We know that the whole trend of thingseverywhere is toward co-operation. Within the past ten years think howmuch cooking has gone into the factory, how much washing into the steamlaundry, how much sewing into the shop. As the cost of living increases,more and more co-operation will be necessary, especially for those ofmoderate income. At the present time millions of city dwellers havegiven up living in their own houses, or even in rented houses. Theycannot afford to maintain individual homes, but must live in apartmenthouses, where the expenses of heat, and other expenses, notably water,hall, and janitor service, are reduced to a minimum because shared byall the tenants. There may come a time when the private kitchen will bea luxury of the very rich.For a time, however, the private kitchen and the servant in the kitchenwill remain. That is one servant problem. But the housekeeper still hasanother "servant problem," and I have tried to make it clear that thisproblem pretty closely involves the morals of the community.Now this matter of community morals has begun to interest womenprofoundly. In many of their organizations women are studying andendeavoring to understand the causes of evil. They are securing theappointment of educated women as probation officers in the courts whichdeal with delinquent women and girls. Sincerely they are working towarda better understanding of the problem of the prodigal daughter.Since about one-third of all these prodigals are recruited from theranks of domestic workers it is possible for the housekeepers of thecountry to play an important part in this work. Every woman in theUnited States who employs one servant has a contribution to make to themovement. The power to humanize domestic service in her own household isin every woman's hand.Loneliness, social isolation, the ban of social inferiority,--thesecruel and unreasonable restrictions placed upon an entire class ofworking women are out of tune with democracy. The right of the domesticworker to regular hours of labor, to freedom after her work is done, toa place to receive her friends, must be recognized. The self-respect ofthe servant must in all ways be encouraged.Above all, the right of the domestic worker to social opportunity mustbe admitted. It must be provided for.Yonkers, New York, a large town on the Hudson River, points out one waytoward this end. In Yonkers there has been established a Women'sInstitute for the exclusive use of domestics. It has an employmentagency and supports classes in domestic science for those girls who wishto become more expert workers. There are club rooms and recreationparlors where the girls receive and meet their friends--including theirmen friends. A group of liberal-minded women established this uniqueinstitution, which is well patronized by the superior class of domesticworkers in Yonkers. The dues are small, and members are allowed to shareclub privileges with friends. It is not unusual for employers to presenttheir domestics with membership cards. It cannot be said that theWomen's Institute has solved the servant problem for Yonkers, but manywomen testify to its happy effects on their own individual problems.The Committee on Amusements and Vacation Resources of Working Girls inNew York is collecting a long list of farmhouses and village homes inthe mountains and near the sea where working girls, and this includesdomestics, may spend their vacations for very little money.Every summer, as families leave the city for country and seaside,domestics are thrown out of employment. A department in the Women's Clubcan examine vacation possibilities for domestics. The clubs can alsodeal with the employment agency. Some women's organizations have alreadytaken hold of this department. The Women's Educational and IndustrialUnion of Boston conducts a very large and flourishing employment agency.Women's clubs can study the laws of their own community in regard topublic employment agencies. They can investigate homes for immigrantgirls and boarding-houses for working women.Preventive work is better than reform measures, but both are necessaryin dealing with this problem. Women have still much work to do insecuring reformatories for women. New York is the first State toestablish such reformatories for adult women. Private philanthropy hasoffered refuges and semipenal institutions. The State stands aloof.Even in New York public officials are strangely skeptical of thepossibilities of reform. Last year the courts of New York City sentthree thousand delinquent women to the workhouse on Blackwell'sIsland,--a place notorious for the low state of its _morale_. They sentonly seventeen women to Bedford Reformatory, where a healthy routine ofoutdoor work, and a most effective system administered by a scientificpenologist does wonders with its inmates. Nothing but the will and theorganized effort of women will ever solve the most terrible of allproblems, or remove from society the reproach of ruined womanhood whichblackens it now.NOTES:Note 1: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904.CHAPTER XVOTES FOR WOMENAlthough Woman Suffrage has been for a number of years a part of theprogram of the International Council of Women, the American Branch,represented by the General Federation of Women's Clubs, at firstdisplayed little interest in the subject. Although many of the clubwomen were strong suffragists, there were many others, notably womenfrom the Southern States, who were violently opposed to suffrage. Earlyin the club movement it was agreed that suffrage, being a subject onwhich there was an apparently hopeless difference of opinion, was not aproper subject for club consideration.The position of the women in regard to suffrage was precisely that ofthe early labor unions toward politics. The unions, fearing that thelabor leaders would use the men for their own political advancement,resolved that no question of politics should ever enter into theirdeliberations.In the same way the club women feared that even a discussion of WomanSuffrage in their state and national federation meetings would result intheir movement becoming purely political. They wanted to keep it anon-partisan benevolent and social affair.[Illustration: SUFFRAGETTES IN LONDON ADVERTISING A MEETING]Somehow, in what mysterious manner no one can precisely tell, thereserve of the club women towards the suffrage question began some yearsago to break down. At the St. Louis Biennial of 1904 part of a morningsession was given up to the suffrage organizations. Several remarkablespeeches in favor of the suffrage were made, and there is no doubt thata very deep impression was made, even upon those women openly opposed tothe movement. Six years later, at the biennial meeting held inCincinnati, Ohio, in June, 1910, an entire evening was given up to anexhaustive discussion of both sides of the question.Dating from that evening a stranger visiting the convention might almosthave thought that the sole object of the gathering was a discussion ofthe right of women to the ballot. Women floated through the corridors ofthe hotel talking suffrage. They talked suffrage in little groups in thedining-room, they discussed it in the street cars going to and from theconvention.The local suffrage clubs had planned a banquet to the visitingsuffragists and had calculated a maximum of one hundred and fiftyapplications for tickets.Three days before the banquet they had had nearly three hundredapplications, and when the hour for the banquet arrived every availableseat, the room's limit of three hundred and seventy-five, was occupied.Outside were women offering ten dollars a plate and clamoring for theprivilege of merely listening to the after-dinner speakers. Somethingmust have happened in the course of those eight years to make such anastounding change in the attitude of the club women.The fact is that until the club women had been at work at practicalthings for a long period of years, they did not realize the social valueof their own activities. They thought of their work as benevolent andphilanthropic. That they were performing community service, _citizens_'service, they did not remotely dream. There is nothing surprising intheir _naivete_. It is a fact that in this country, although every oneknows that women own property, pay taxes, successfully manage their ownbusiness affairs, and do an astonishing amount of community work aswell, no one ever thinks of them as citizens.American men are accustomed to women in almost all trades andprofessions. It doesn't astonish a New Yorker to see a hospitalambulance tearing down the street with a white-clad woman surgeon on theback seat. A woman lawyer, architect, editor, manufacturer, excites noparticular notice. In the Western States men are beginning to electwomen county treasurers, county superintendents of schools, and inChicago, second largest city in the country, a Board of Education,overwhelmingly masculine, recently appointed a woman City Superintendentof Schools.Yet to the vast majority of American men women do not look likecitizens.As for the majority of American women they have always until recentlythought of themselves as a class,--a favored and protected class. Theycherished a sentimental kind of delusion that the American man was onlytoo anxious to give them everything that their hearts desired. When theygot out into the world of action, when they began to ask for somethingmore substantial than bonbons, the club women found that the Americanman was not so very generous after all.A typical instance occurred down in Georgia. A few years ago the womenof Georgia found a way to introduce into the legislature a child-laborlaw. It was really a very modest little bill and it protected only afraction of the pitiful army of cotton-mill children, but still it wasworth having. The women worked hard and they got some very powerfulbacking and a barrel or two of petitions. Nevertheless, the bill wasdefeated. One legislative orator rose to explain his vote."Mr. Speaker," he said eloquently, "I am devoted to the good women of myState. If I thought that the women of my State wanted this bill passedI would vote for it; but, sir, I have every reason to believe that thegood women of my State are opposed to this bill, and therefore;"At this juncture another member handed to the orator a petition bearingthe name of five thousand of the best known women in Georgia. The oratorstammered, turned red, felt for his handkerchief, mopped his brow, andcontinued: "Mr. Speaker, I deeply regret that I did not see thispetition yesterday. As it is, my vote is pledged."Incidents of this kind have occurred too frequently for the women of theUnited States to escape their meaning. They have learned that theycannot have everything they want merely by asking for it. Also they havelearned, or a large number of them have learned that the old theory ofwomen being represented at the polls by their husbands is very largely adelusion.The entrance of women in large numbers into labor unions, and intomembership in the Women's Trade Union League is another factor in theincreasing interest of American women in suffrage. After a decision ofthe New York Court of Appeals that the law prohibiting night work ofwomen was unconstitutional, nearly one thousand women book-binders inNew York City made a public announcement that they would thenceforthwork for the ballot. They had been indifferent before, but this closeapplication of politics to their industrial situation--bookbinding isone of the night trades--made them alive to their own helplessness.The shirt-waist strike and the garment workers' strike in New York andPhiladelphia, waged so bitterly in 1910, brought great numbers of womeninto the suffrage ranks. Not only were the women strikers convinced thatthe magistrates and the police treated them with more contempt than theydid the voting men, but they perceived the need of securing better laborlaws for themselves. The conviction that women of the wealthier classeswould stand by them in securing favorable laws, as they stood by thestrikers in the industrial struggle, was a strong lever to turn themtowards the suffrage ranks.[Illustration: MRS. HARRIOT STANTON BLATCH]The Women's Trade Union League building, used as strike headquarters inall strikes involving women workers, is a veritable center of suffragesentiment in New York! One floor houses the offices of the EqualityLeague of Self Supporting Women, of which Harriot Stanton Blatch isfounder and president. This society, which is entirely made up of tradeand professional workers, claims an approximate membership of twenty-twothousand. A number of unions belong to the League, and there is also avery large individual membership.In Chicago the suffrage movement and the labor movement is more closelyassociated than in any other American city. In Chicago, it will beremembered, the Teachers' Federation is a trade union and is allied tothe Central Labor Union. Teachers, almost everywhere denied equal paywith men for equal work, are eager seekers for political power. When, asin Chicago, they are associated with labor, they become convincedsuffragists.Organized labor has always been friendly to woman suffrage, but inChicago not only the union women but the union men are actively friendlytowards the cause. The original moving spirit in the Chicagoorganization was a remarkable young working girl, Josephine Casey. MissCasey sold tickets at one of the stations of the Chicago Elevated, andshe formed her first woman suffrage club among the women members of theUnion of Street and Elevated Railway Employees. Later she organized on alarger scale the Women's Political Equality Union, with membership opento men and women alike. The interest shown in the union by workingmen,many of whom had never before given the matter a moment's thought, was,from the first, extraordinary. During the first winter of the society'sexistence, union after union called for Woman Suffrage speakers.Addresses were made before fifty or more. Some of the more popularspeakers often made four addresses in an evening. Mrs. Raymond Robins,president of the National Women's Trade Union League, and Miss AliceHenry, secretary of the Chicago branch of the League, won many convertsby their expositions of the exceedingly favorable labor laws ofAustralia and New Zealand, where women vote.[Illustration: MEETING A RELEASED SUFFRAGETTE PRISONER.]Unquestionably the mighty battle which is waging in England made a deepimpression on American women of all classes. The visits made in thiscountry by Mrs. Cobden Sanderson, Mrs. Borrman Wells, Mrs. PhilipSnowden, and, most of all, Mrs. Pankhurst, leader of the militantEnglish Suffragists, aroused tremendous enthusiasm from one end of thecountry to the other. Never, until these women appeared, telling, withrare eloquence, their stories of struggle, of arrest and imprisonment,had the vote appeared such an incomparable treasure. Never before,except among a few enthusiasts, had there existed any feeling that thesuffrage was a thing to fight for, suffer for, even to die for.Up to this time the suffrage was a theory, an academic question of rightand justice. After the visits of the English women, American suffragistseverywhere began to view their cause in the light of a politicalmovement. They began to adopt political methods. Instead of privatemeetings where suffrage was discussed before a select audience of thealready convinced, the women began to mount soap boxes on street cornersand to talk suffrage to the man in the street.The first suffrage demonstration was held in New York in February, 1908.The members of a small but enthusiastic Equal Suffrage Club announcedtheir intention of having a parade. Most of the women being wage earnersthey planned to have their parade on a Sunday. When they applied atPolice Headquarters for the necessary permit they found to their disgustthat Sunday parades were forbidden by law."Not unless you are a funeral procession," said the stern captain of thepolice.The woman replied that they were anything but a funeral procession, andthreatened darkly to hold their parade in spite of police regulations.They got plenty of newspaper publicity in the succeeding days, and onthe following Sunday a huge crowd of men, a sprinkling of women, agenerous number of plain clothes men, and New York's famous "camerasquad" assembled in Union Square, where all incendiary things happen.The dauntless seven who made up the suffrage club were there, and at thepsychological moment one of the women ran up the steps of a parkpavilion and spoke in a ringing voice, yet so quietly that the policemade no move to stop her."Friends," she said, "we are not allowed to have our parade, so we aregoing to hold a meeting of protest at No. 209 East 23d Street. We inviteyou to go over there with us." She and the others walked calmly out ofthe square, and the crowd followed. They turned into Fifth Avenue, andthe crowd grew larger. Before three blocks were passed there wereliterally thousands of people marching in the wake of ingenioussuffragists.The sight aroused the indignation of many respectable citizens."Officer," exclaimed one of these, addressing an attendant policeman, "Ithought you had orders that those females were not to parade.""That ain't no parade," said the policeman, serenely; "them folks isjust takin' a quiet walk."The suffragists have taken more than one quiet walk since then. Streetspeaking has become an almost daily occurrence. At first there was somerioting, or, rather, some display of rowdyism on the part of thespectators and some show of interference from the police. The crowdslisten respectfully now, and the police are friendly.The most practical move the New York Suffragists have made was theorganization, early in 1910, of the Woman Suffrage Party, a fusion ofnearly all the suffrage clubs in the greater city into an associationexactly along the lines of a regular political party. At the head of theparty as president is Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of theInternational Woman Suffrage Association. Each of the five boroughs ofthe city has a chairman, and each senatorial and assembly district iseither organized or is in process of organization.[Illustration: THE WOMEN'S TRADES PROCESSION TO THE ALBERT HALL MEETING,APRIL 27, 1909]Absolutely democratic in its spirit and its organization, the partyleaders are drawn from every rank of society. The chairman of theborough of Manhattan is Mrs. James Lees Laidlaw, wife of a prominentWall Street banker. Mrs. Frederick Nathan, president of the New YorkState Consumers' League, is chairman of the assembly district in whichshe lives. Mrs. Melvil Dewey, whose husband is head of a department atColumbia University, is chairman of her own district. Other chairmen areHelen Hoy Greeley, lawyer; Lavinia Dock, trained nurse; Anna Mercy, anEast Side physician; Maud Flowerton, buyer in a department store;Gertrude Barnum, sociologist and writer. Practically every trade andprofession are represented in the party's ranks.The object of the Woman Suffrage Party is organization for politicalwork. Last winter the party made the first aggressive move towardsforcing the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly to report on the bill togive women votes by constitutional amendment. They succeeded in gettinga motion made for the discharge of the committee, sixteen legislatorsvoting for the women.New York is the present center of the progressive suffrage movement,with Chicago not very far behind.In rather amazing fashion are women in many American communitiesbeginning to realize that politics are as much their business as men's.In Salt Lake City when a city council undertakes to give away a valuablewater franchise, or extend gamblers' privileges, or otherwise follow theexample of many another city council in bending before the god of greed,the women of Salt Lake send the word around. When the council meets thewomen are in the room. They don't say anything. They don't have to sayanything. They can vote, these women. More than once the deep-laid plansof the most powerful politicians in Salt Lake City have been completelyfrustrated by a silent warning from the women. The city council has notdared to pass grafting measures with a roomful of women looking on.[Illustration: HELEN HOY GREELEY]Even the non-voting woman has discovered the power which attaches to herpresence, in certain circumstances. In San Francisco during the secondRuef trial, when the decent element of the city was fighting to down oneof the worst bosses that ever cursed a community, the women, under theleadership of Mrs. Elizabeth Gerberding, performed this new kind ofpicket duty. The courtroom where the trial was held was, by order of theboss's attorney, packed with hired toughs whose duty it was to make amockery of the prosecution. Every point against the Ruef side wasreceived by these toughs with jeers and hootings. The district attorneywas insulted, badgered, and openly threatened with violence.Mrs. Gerberding, whose husband is editor of a newspaper opposed to bossrule, attended several sessions, and induced a large number of women ofsocial importance to attend with her. These women went daily to thecourtroom, occupying seats to the exclusion of many of the toughcharacters, and by their presence doing much to preserve order and toassist the efforts of the district attorney. When the assassin's bulletwas fired at the district attorney a number of the women were present.Out of the horror and detestation of this crime was organized theWomen's League of Justice, which soon had a membership of five hundred.The league fought stoutly for the reelection of Heney as districtattorney. Heney was defeated, and the league became the Women's CivicClub of San Francisco, pledged to work for political betterment and aclean city government.In four States of the Union, Washington, Oregon, South Dakota, andOklahoma, the voters will this autumn vote for or against constitutionalamendments giving women the right to vote. It is not very probable thatthe Suffragists will win in any of these States, not because the votersare opposed to suffrage, but because they are, for the most part,uninformed. The suffrage advocates have not yet learned enough politicalwisdom to further their cause through education of the voters.Although enormous sums of money have been spent in suffrage campaigns,in no one has enough money been available to do the work thoroughly. Inthe four States where the question is at present before the voters,complaint is made that there is not enough money in the treasuriesproperly to circulate literature.Many of the wisest leaders in the National Woman Suffrage Association,including Dr. Anna Shaw, Ida Husted Harper, and others, are advising analtogether new method of conducting the struggle for the ballot. Theyadvocate selecting a State, possibly Nebraska, where conditions seemuncommonly favorable, and concentrating the entire strength of thenational organization, every dollar of money in the national treasury,all the speakers and organizers, all the literature, in a mighty effortto give the women of that one State the ballot. The vote won inNebraska, the national association should pass on to the next mostfavorable State and win a victory there. The moral effect of suchcampaigns would no doubt be very great.One of the principal reasons why men hesitate in this country to givethe voting power to women is that they do not know, and they rather fearto guess, how far women would unite in forcing their own policies on thecountry. If an Irish vote, or a German vote, or a Catholic vote, or aHebrew vote is to be dreaded, say the men, how much more of a menacewould a woman vote be. I heard a man, a delegate from an anti-suffrageassociation, solemnly warn the New York State Legislature, at a suffragehearing, against this danger of a woman vote. "When the majority ofwomen and the minority of men vote together," he declared, "there willbe no such thing as personal liberty left in the United States."[Illustration: SUFFRAGETTES IN MADISON SQUARE.]Under certain conditions a woman vote is not an unthinkable contingency.It has even occurred.For the edification of the possible reader who is entirely uninformed,it may be explained that women are not entirely disenfranchised in theUnited States. Women vote on equal terms with men, in four States. Theyhave voted in Wyoming since 1869; in Colorado since 1894; in Utah andIdaho since 1896. They vote at school elections and on certain questionsof taxation in twenty-eight States.While it is true that in the States which have a small measure ofsuffrage the women show little interest in voting, in the four so-calledsuffrage States, they vote conscientiously and in about the sameproportion as men.But here is a notable thing. The women of the suffrage States differ solittle from the women of other States, and women in general, that thechief concerns of their lives are the home, the school, and thebaby,--the Kaiser's "Kirche, Kueche, und Kinder" over again. They votewith enthusiasm on all questions which relate to domestic interests,that is, which directly relate to them and their children. Aside fromthis, the woman vote has made a deep impression on the moral characterof candidates and that is about all it has meant. In general politicswomen have counted scarcely more than have the women of other States.But the new interest in suffrage, the new realization of themselves ascitizens that has been aroused all over the United States within thepast two years have seriously affected the women voters of at least onesuffrage State, Colorado.The women of Colorado, especially the women of Denver, have for severalyears taken an active part in legislation directly affecting themselvesand their children. The legislative committee of the Colorado StateFederation of Clubs has held regular meetings during the sessions of theState Legislature, and it has been a regular custom to submit to thatcommittee for approval all bills relating to women and children. Thisnever seemed to the politicians to be anything very dangerous to theirinterests. It was, in a manner of speaking, a chivalric acknowledgmentof women's virtue as wives and mothers.But lately the women of Colorado have begun to wake up to the fact thatnot only special legislation, but all legislation, is of direct interestto them. It has lately dawned upon them that the matter of streetrailway franchise affects the home as directly as a proposition to erecta high school. Also it has dawned on them that without organization, andmore organization, the woman vote was more or less powerless. So, abouta year ago they formed in Denver an association of women which theycalled the Public Service League. Nothing quite like it ever existedbefore. It is a political but non-partisan association of women, pledgedto work for the civic betterment of Denver, pledged to fight the corruptpoliticians, determined that the city government shall be welladministered even if the women have to take over the offices themselves.The League is, in effect, a secret society of women. It has aninflexible rule that its proceedings are to be kept inviolable. There isa perfect understanding that any woman who divulges one syllable of whatoccurs at a meeting of the League will be instantly dropped frommembership. No woman has yet been dropped.It may well be understood that this secret society of women, thisnon-partisan league of voters, is a thing to strike terror into theheart of a ward boss. As a matter of fact, the corrupt politicians andthe equally corrupt heads of corporations who had long held Denver inbondage regard the Public Service League in mingled dread anddetestation. Equally as a matter of fact politicians of a better classare anxious to enlist the good will of the League. Last summer a Denverelection involved a question of granting a twenty years' franchise to astreet railway company. Opposed to the granting of the franchise was anewly formed citizens' party. Opposed also was the Women's PublicService League. In gratitude for the co-operation of the League theCitizens' Party offered a place on the electoral ticket to any womanchosen by the League.It was the first time in the history of Colorado that a municipal officehad been offered to a woman, and the League promptly took advantage ofit. They named as a candidate for Election Commissioner Miss EllisMeredith, one of the best known, best loved women in the State. Asjournalist and author and club woman Miss Meredith is known far beyondher own State, and her nomination created intense interest not onlyamong the women of her own city and State, but among club womeneverywhere.On the evening of May 3, 1910, there was a meeting held in the BroadwayTheater, Denver, the like of which no American city ever beforewitnessed. It was a women's political mass meeting to endorse thecandidacy of a woman municipal official. The meeting was entirely in thehands of women. Presiding over the immense throng was Mrs. Sarah PlattDecker, formerly president, and still leader of the General Federationof Women's Clubs. Beside her sat Mrs. Helen Grenfell, for thirteen yearscounty and State superintendent of schools, Mrs. Helen Ring Robinson,Mrs. Martha A.B. Conine, and Miss Gail Laughlin, all women of note intheir community. The enthusiasm aroused by that meeting did not subside,and on the day of the election Miss Meredith ran so far ahead of herticket that it seemed as if every woman in Denver, as well as most ofthe men, had voted for her. She took her place in the Board of ElectionCommissioners, and was promptly elected Chairman of the Board.There is nothing especially attractive about the office of ElectionCommissioner. In accepting the nomination Miss Meredith said franklythat she was influenced mainly by two things: first a desire to test theloyalty of the women voters, and second, because, while women had beenheld accountable for elections which have disgraced the city of Denver,they have never before been given a chance to manage the elections.Nothing is more certain that women, when they become enfranchised, willnever, in any large numbers, appear as office seekers. It is probablethat office will be thrust upon the ablest of them. Mrs. Sarah PlattDecker has been spoken of as a possible future Mayor of Denver, and itis certain that she could be elected to Congress if she would allowherself to be placed in nomination.A few women have been elected to the legislatures in the suffrageStates, and they have held high office in educational departments. Insuffrage and nonsuffrage States they have been elected to many countyoffices. Miss Gertrude Jordan is Treasurer of Cherry County, Nebraska.In Idaho, Texas, Louisiana, and several other States women have filledthe same position. The State of Kansas is a true believer in womenoffice-holders, even though it refuses its women complete suffrage.Women can vote in Kansas only at municipal elections, but in fortycounties men have elected women school superintendents. They are clerksof four counties, treasurers of three, and commissioners of one. In onecounty of Kansas a woman is probate judge. The good and faithful workdone by these women ought to go a long way towards educating men oftheir community to the idea of political association with women.The attitude of men towards suffrage has undergone an enormous changewithin the past two years. A large number of the thinking men of thecountry have openly enlisted in the Suffrage ranks. It is said thatalmost every member of the faculty of Columbia University signed theSuffrage petition presented to the Congress of 1909. Well-knownprofessors of many Western universities and colleges have spoken andwritten in favor of equal suffrage. In New York City a flourishingVoters' League for Equal Suffrage has been formed, with a membershiprunning into the hundreds.[Illustration: THE "QUIET WALK" OF THE NEW YORK SUFFRAGISTS, WHOM THEPOLICE WOULD NOT PERMIT TO PARADE]To the average unprejudiced man the old arguments against politicalequality have almost entirely lost weight. The theory that women shouldnot vote because they cannot fight is now rarely argued. Municipalgovernments certainly no longer rest on physical force. The same is trueof state governments, and it is probably true of national governments.At all events we are sincerely trying to make it true. For the rest itwould be extremely difficult to prove that women would make undesirablecitizens. To the anxious inquiry, What will women do with their votes?the answer is simple. They will do with their votes precisely what theydo, or try to do, without votes. This has been proven in every countryin the world where they have received the franchise. In Australia, NewZealand, Finland, and in the English municipalities the ideal of thecommon good has been reflected in the woman vote. Social legislationalone interests women, and so far they have confined their efforts tomatters of education, child labor, pure food, sanitation, control ofliquor traffic, and public morals. The organized non-voting women ofthis country have devoted themselves for years to precisely theseobjects. Without votes, without precedents, and without very much moneythey instituted the playground movement, and the juvenile courtmovement, two of the greatest reforms this country has contributed tocivilization. They have instituted a dozen reforms in our educationalsystem. They practically invented the town and village improvement idea.They have co-operated with every social reform advocated by men, and itis to be noted that wherever their judgment has been in error they haveconscientiously erred in favor of a wider democracy, a more exaltedsocial ideal.[Illustration: SUFFRAGE DEMONSTRATION IN UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK]However long-deferred Woman Suffrage may prove to be, it is prettygenerally conceded that women will inevitably vote some day. Theevolution of society will bring them into political equality with menjust as it has brought them into intellectual and industrial equality.The first woman who followed her spinning-wheel out of her home into thefactory was the natural ancestress of the first woman who demanded theballot.The application of steam to machinery took women's trades out of thehome and placed them in the factory. The effect of this was that menwere confronted with a singular dilemma. They had to choose between twocourses; they had to support their women in idleness, or else they hadto allow them to leave the home and go where their trades had gone. Thefirst course involving the intolerable burden of doing their own andtheir women's work, they were obliged to choose the second. Thejealously-guarded doors of the home were opened, and little by little,grudgingly, the men admitted women to full industrial freedom.Women's housekeeping, or most of it, has gradually been withdrawn fromthe home and transferred to the municipality. There was a time whenwomen could ensure their families pure food, good milk, clean ice,proper sanitation. They cannot do that now. The City Hall governs allsuch matters. Again the men find themselves facing the old dilemma. Theymust either support their women in idleness--do all their own as well asthe women's housekeeping--or they must allow their women to leave thehome and follow their housekeeping to the place where it is now beingdone,--the polls.Women are beginning to understand the situation. They are even beginningto understand how badly the men are providing for the municipal family.They are demanding their old housekeeping tasks back again. To thispoint has the Suffrage movement, begun in 1848 by a band of women calledfanatics, arrived.CHAPTER XIIN CONCLUSIONI have tried to set down in these pages the collective opinion of women,as far as it has expressed itself through deeds. I have not succeeded ifany reader lays down the book with the impression that he has merelybeen reading the story of the American club woman. I have not succeededat all if my readers imagine that I have been writing only about aselected group of women. What I have meant to do is to show theinstinctive bent of the universal woman mind in all ages, reflected inthe actions of the freest group of women the world has ever seen.I might have reanimated ages of stone and of bronze; might have shownyou women, through slow centuries, inventing the arts of spinning andweaving, and pottery molding; learning to build, to till the earth, togrind and to cook grains, to tan skins for clothing against the cold. Noone taught them these things. Out of their brains, as undeveloped and asprimitive as the brains of men, they would never have conceived so muchwisdom. The vague mind of the savage woman never sent her to the spider,the nesting bird, and the burrowing squirrel to learn to weave and tobuild and to store. When we find exactly what it was that taughtprimitive woman how to lay the first stones of civilization, we have aperfect philosophical understanding of all women.I chose to interpret the woman mind through the modern American woman,partly because she has learned the great lesson of organization, and hasthus been able to work more effectively, and to impress her will on thecommunity more strikingly than other women in other ages. What she hasdone is apparent and easy to prove.Also, I chose the American club woman because she represents, not anunusually gifted type, but the average intelligent, well-educated,energetic, wife-and-mother type of woman. The club woman is not radical,or at least not consciously radical. She has not, like the progressiveGerman and Russian woman, theories of political regeneration or offamily reconstruction. What she desires, what ideals she has formed, Ithink must fairly represent the desires and ideals of the great mass ofwomen of the twentieth century.When we survey the activities the club women have engaged in, when wediscover why they chose exactly these activities, we have a perfectphilosophical understanding, not only of the modern woman mind, but ofthe cave woman mind and all the woman mind in between.The woman mind is the most unchangeable thing in the world. It hasturned on identically the same pivot since the present race began.Perhaps before.Turn back and count over the club women's achievements, the things theyhave chosen to do, the things they want. Observe first of all that theywant very little for themselves. Even their political liberty they wantonly because it will enable them to get other things--things needed,directly or indirectly, by children. Most of the things are directlyneeded,--playgrounds, school gardens, child-labor laws, juvenile courts,kindergartens, pure food laws, and other visible tokens of childconcern. Many of the other things are indirectly needed bychildren,--ten-hour working days, seats for shop girls, protection fromdangerous machinery, living wages, opportunities for safe and wholesomepleasures, peace and arbitration, social purity, legal equality withmen, all objects which tend to conserve the future mothers of children.These are the things women want.In my introductory chapter I cited three extremely grave and significantfacts which confront modern civilization. The first was the fact ofwomen's growing economic freedom, their emancipation from domesticslavery. I believe that women would not wish to be economically free iftheir instinct gave them any warning that freedom for them meant dangerto their children. But no observer of social conditions can have failedto observe the oceans of misery endured by women and children because oftheir economic dependence on the fortunes of husbands and fathers.Whatever may be the solution of poverty, whatever be the future statusof the family, it seems certain to me that some way will be devisedwhereby motherhood will cease to be a privately supported profession. Insome way society will pay its own account. If producing citizens to theState be the greatest service a woman citizen can perform, the Statewill ultimately recognize the right of the woman citizen to protectionduring her time of service. The first step towards solving the problemis for women to learn to support themselves before the time comes forthem to serve the State. Through the educating process of productivelabor the woman mind may devise a means of protecting the future mothersof the race.The second fact, the growing prevalence of divorce, on the face of itseems to menace the security of the home and of children. So deeplyoverlain with prejudice, conventionalities, and theological traditionsis the average woman as well as the average man that it is difficult toargue in favor of a temporary tolerance of divorce that a permanent highstandard of marriage may be established. But to my mind any state ofaffairs, even a Reno state of affairs, looks more encouraging than theold conditions under which innocent girls married to rakes and drunkardswere forbidden to escape their chains. It is not for the good ofchildren to be born of disease and misery and hatred. It is not fortheir good to be brought up in an atmosphere of hopeless inharmony. Whatis happening in this country is not a weakening of the marriage bond,but a strengthening of it. For soon there will grow up in the Americanman's mind a desire for a marriage which will be at least as equitableas a business partnership; as fair to one party as to the other. He willcease to regard marriage as a state of bondage for the wife and a stateof license for the husband. He will not venture to suggest to a brightwoman that cooking in his kitchen is a more honorable career thanteaching, or painting, or writing, or manufacturing. Marriage will notmean extinction to any woman. It will mean to the well-to-do wifefreedom to do community service. It will mean to the industrial woman aneconomic burden shared. When that time comes there will be no divorceproblem. There will be no longer a class of women who avoid the risk ofdivorce by refusing to marry.The third fact, the increasing popularity of woman suffrage, I disposedof in the preceding chapter. Nothing that the women who vote have everdone indicates, in the remotest degree, that they are not just asmindful of children's interests at the polls as other women are in theirnurseries and kitchens.On the contrary, wherever women have left their kitchens and nurseries,whenever they have gone out into the world of action and of affairs,they have increased their effectiveness as mothers. I do not mean bythis that the girl who enters a factory at fourteen and works there tenhours a day until she marries increases her effectiveness as a mother.Industrial slavery unfits a woman for motherhood as certainly asintellectual and moral slavery unfits her.Women who are free, who look on life through their own eyes, who thinktheir own thoughts, who live in the real world of striving, struggling,suffering humanity, are the most effective mothers that ever lived. Theyknow how to care for their own children, and more than that, they knowhow to care for the community's children.The child at his mother's knee, spelling out the words of a psalm,stands for the moral education of the race--or it used to. A group ofChicago club women walking boldly into the city Bridewell and the CookCounty Jail and demanding that children of ten and twelve should nolonger be locked up with criminals; these same women, after the childrenwere segregated, establishing a school for them, and finally these samewomen achieving a juvenile court, is the modern edition of the oldideal.Woman's place is in the home. This is a platitude which no woman willever dissent from, provided two words are dropped out of it. Woman'splace is Home. Her task is homemaking. Her talents, as a rule, aremainly for homemaking. But Home is not contained within the four wallsof an individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people isthe Family. The public school is the real Nursery. And badly do the Homeand the Family and the Nursery need their mother.I dream of a community where men and women divide the work of governingand administering, each according to his special capacities and naturalabilities. The division of labor between them will be on natural and notconventional lines. No one will be rewarded according to sex, butaccording to work performed. The city will be like a great,well-ordered, comfortable, sanitary household. Everything will be asclean as in a good home. Every one, as in a family, will have enough toeat, clothes to wear, and a good bed to sleep on. There will be noslums, no sweat shops, no sad women and children toiling in tenementrooms. There will be no babies dying because of an impure milk supply.There will be no "lung blocks" poisoning human beings that landlords maypile up sordid profits. No painted girls, with hunger gnawing at theirempty stomachs, will walk in the shadows. All the family will be takencare of, taught to take care of themselves, protected in their dailytasks, sheltered in their homes.The evil things in society are simply the result of half the human race,with only half the wisdom, and not even half the moral power containedin the race, trying to rule the world alone. Men's government rests onforce, on violence. Everything evil, everything bad, everything selfish,is a form of violence. Poverty itself is a form of violence.Women will not tolerate violence. They loathe waste. They cannot bear tosee illness and suffering and starvation. Alone, they are no morecapable of coping with these evils than men are. But they have the veryresources that men lack. Working with men they could accomplishmiracles.Note the inventiveness of women, most of which goes to waste becausethey lack the wonderful constructive ability of men. Women inventedspinning. They could never have harnessed the lightning to their wheels.Women established the first public playgrounds. Men extended the publicplaygrounds across the country.Women established the juvenile court. Men took it over and worked out anew system of criminal jurisprudence for children. Women have cleaned upa hundred cities. Men are rebuilding them. Slowly men and women arelearning to live and work together. Reluctantly men are coming to acceptwomen as their co-workers.Woman's place is Home, and she must not be forbidden to dwell there. Whowould be so selfish, so blind, so reactionary, as to forbid her herfullest freedom to do her work, must surrender opposition in the end.For woman's work is race preservation, race improvement, and who opposesher, or interferes with her, simply fights nature, and nature neverloses her battles.INDEXAberdeen, Countess of,Addams, Jane,Alabama,Aladyn, Alexis,Albert Hall, London,Albion House of Refuge, N.Y.,Aldrich, Mrs. Richard,Allegheny, Pa.,Allgemeinen Deutschen Frauenbund,American, Sadie,American Federation of LaborAmerican women and common lawArbitration,Argentine,Arizona,ArkansasArthur, Mrs. Clara B.,Association of Collegiate Alumnae,Association of Working Girls' Clubs,Augsberg, Anita,Australia,AustriaBalliett, Thomas M.,Barnum, GertrudeBarrett, Mrs. Kate Waller,Bedford Reformatory, N.Y.,Belmont, Mrs. O.H.P.,Berlin,Birmingham, Ala.,BlackstoneBlackwell's Island,Blatch, Harriot Stanton,Bluhm, Agnes,Boston, MassBoston Central Labor Union,Boswell, Helen V.,Brandeis, Louis D.Brewer, Justice,Brooklyn, N.Y.,Bullowa, Emilie,CaliforniaCarlisle, Pa.,Carnegie, Andrew,Casey, Josephine,Catt, Mrs. Carrie Chapman,Cauer, Minna,ChicagoChild, Lydia Maria,Church, the Christian, its relation to social problems,Civic Club of Allegheny CountyCivic Club of Philadelphia,Cleveland, O.Cliff Dwellers' remains,Cobden Sanderson, Mrs.,Code NapoleonCole, ElsieCollege Settlements Association,Colony Club,Colorado,Colorado State Federation of Clubs,Columbia University,Columbus, Ohio,Common law,Coney IslandConine, Mrs. Martha A.B.,Consumers' League of N.Y.,Consumers' LeaguesConventions of women's clubs,Corpus Juris,Cotton mills, women and girls inCouncil of WomenCranford, N.J.,Cutting, Fulton,Dallas, Tex.,Dance halls,Daughters of the American Revolution,Daughters of the Confederacy,Davis, Mrs. Jefferson,Decker, Mrs. Sarah Platt,Delaware,Denver, Colo.,Department stores,Detroit,Devine, Edward T.,Dewey, Mrs. Melvil,Dineen, Governor,District of Columbia,DivorceDock, Lavinia,Domestic service,_Domestic Service_, ProfessorSalmon's,Donnelly, Annie,Dreier, Mary,Dutcher, Elizabeth,Eight-hour day,Ely Bates Settlement,Employment agencies,EnglandEquality League of Self-Supporting Women,Europe,European women,Evans, Mrs. Glendower,Factories,Fall River, Mass.Festivals, play,FeudalismFilene system,FinlandFloridaFlowerton, Maud,Folks, Homer,France,Franks, SalianFrench Code,Gad, Elizabeth,General Federation of Women's Clubs,GeorgiaGerberding, Mrs. Elizabeth,German Woman Suffrage Association,Germany,Gillespie, Mabel,Gilman, Charlotte Perkins, her _Women and Economics_,"Girls' Bill,"Girls' Friendly Association,Golden, John,Goldmark, Josephine,Goldmark, Pauline,Gompers, SamuelGrannis, Mrs. Elizabeth,Greece,Greece, Queen of,Greeley, Helen Hoy,Greenbaum, Sadie,Grenfell, Mrs. Helen,Gulick, Luther H.,Harper, Ida Husted,Harrisburg, Pa.,Hearn,Henry, Alice,Holland,Housekeepers' Alliance,Hughes, Governor,Hundred Years' War,Iceland,Idaho,Illinois,Inheritance,Intermunicipal Committee on Household Research,International Council of Women,International Woman Suffrage AllianceIowa,Israels, Mrs. Charles M.Italy,Janes, Elizabeth,Jefferson Market Court,Jordan, Gertrude,KansasKellor, Frances,Kennard, Beulah,Kirby, John, Jr.,Kusserow, AnnaLafferty, Mrs. Alma,Laidlaw, Mrs. James Lees,Lake City, Minn.,Laughlin, Gail,Laundries,Law, AmericanLegal Aid Society of N.Y.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.

Eckrich, and the ProjectGutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading TeamTHE FORGOTTEN THRESHOLDA Journal of Arthur MiddletonTO W.S.B.FOR SUBSTANTIAL EMBODIMENTPREFATORY NOTEBefore Arthur Middleton died he gave me this record among others inthe belief that it would help to tell me what he had always known inthe silences, yet could never in life transmute into the friendlycounters of speech. During the last years of his all too briefexperience of his friends, more than once he shyly sought to tell whathe knew, yet always silence claimed him, and nothing but the wonder ofhis eyes revealed the dream that consumed his heart. Because beautyclaims these words in a deeper knowledge than we had before, I havetranscribed this fragment of them here, confident that in these whiteintuitions of his youth there is a revelation of the Light behindbeauty beyond our poor knowledge and still poorer faith. I haveomitted only what was most sacred to the privacies of his heart andour affection. He was of the old faith and would have wished had hepublished these pages to have expressed his entire and passionateloyalty to the Roman Catholic Church in faith and deed, and to havedisclaimed any word therein which conflicted with the intimacies ofits truth. I can do no more than to echo his wish, and mourn theunhappy chance which took him from us on an April tide, though itbefell on the Easter that he loved and at that hour when the flamingsymbol of the Divine Sacrifice was setting in the west. So the passionof the sun and tide which reflected his belief witnessed theconsummation of his great desire.--THE EDITOR.THE FORGOTTEN THRESHOLDTHE JOURNAL(N.B.--On the opening pages of the blank book in which this journal iscontained there is a short fragment which bears no relation that I candiscover to the entries that follow, and I am inclined to believe thatit is the beginning of an autobiography which Middleton nevercontinued. In my uncertainty, however, I print it, and accordingly itis transcribed below.--THE EDITOR.)_Fragment_.--I was not more than three years old when the sunlightfirst made me happy as it stole through the curtains and over thecoverlet till it kissed my lips and wrapped me in its warm embrace.Then I would fall asleep again and my dreams, if I dreamed at all,were white and faintly stirred me to a smile. I never tried to catchthe sunbeams, for I felt their gold in my heart, nor could they havebeen nearer than they were, being associated with my mother'swatchfulness as she stole in to smile upon my slumbers and claim thesecond silent unconscious kiss. On Sunday morning they would befreighted with a quiet whiter light, more peaceful and hushed to thefeeling of the day, and somehow the peace was guarded with finger onlip throughout the house, so that it was implicit in my nest of imageslong before reason took note of it or sought to explain it to myconsciousness. Once again as a boy of fifteen I knew it with a catchof delighted and almost tearful surprise when I stroked the breast ofa wounded pigeon who found shelter in my room. The world is not asquiet in these days, nor is the hum of traffic in the mart attuned sokindly to the flow of light as when it ran so gently by the bedside ofthe dreaming boy. ...(The journal now follows, written in a small cramped hand, withoutparagraphing or division. I omit the first few entries as purelypersonal. Middleton had gone to a group of remote western islands, andthese notes are the fruit of his sojourn there.)--THE EDITOR.July 5.Yesterday found me on the island with its silences, and last night thehost was red and sacrificial and rode on a thunder cloud. Thisafternoon the planets go singing through my flesh and my song ofpraise has widened to the arches of the sun. The sea is moaning slowlyon the sand. I stripped to the cool salt air for the first time. ...Walking I found my way out on the long gray dunes.July 6.On the dunes today with my mother. My hand swept idly over the softwhite sand, shifting the order of many thousands of starry worlds.What a chord of music if one could but hear it in its entirety! As itwas, I caught wonderful echoes that would light the beauties of many asunrise. The silent man reminds me of Synge in his drifting life andthe fires glowing in his eyes. Today I saw the-beauty of a flower. ...Some day I shall write a play about the stars. The action will burn intheir seedtime and blow on the winds of Fate with all its ironies. ...Tonight in the sitting room I heard in my heart the singing of thesands. It is on the shifting desert, I feel, that we shall discoverthe secret origin of language. How the infinitely aspiring music mustsound tonight along the dunes!July 7.The night before last after I retired I felt that lifted feelingphysically which represents the beating of the tides. Last night itcoalesced with the singing of the sands. At Mass this morning thevoices at the Credo thundered out _Et Homo factus est_ in a torrent ofliving sound. At the elevation I saw a thin white flame rise from theuplifted chalice and disappear. It takes a beam of light one hundredand eight years to travel from Arcturus to the earth. Are we similartraveling beams, and is death merely our arrival on another planetwhich we illumine? Today I read aloud on the cliffs from the gloriesof Plato's _Phaedrus_.July 8.In the morning I wandered onto the dunes leading out toward WonderIsland, but was driven off by the terns who were nesting. ... Thebillows of the wind today mingled in me with the sands and the tide,so that I experienced from a new angle Landor's "We are what suns andwinds and waters make us." ...July 9.My life will see much traveling.July 10.Morning on the dunes. A cold clear bath while mists drove over thesands. Returning home, as I came to the deep sand on the road, Iperceived the mystery of the resurrection of the body. In death thereis no physical decay. The singing planets of the human body merelypart to combine in other songs, recurring again in the end to theirold disposal and song, exchanging other worlds for their own oncemore, and recurring to the first motif of the symphony. I was sad thisafternoon for the will failed me in my work. Sitting on the sand thismorning the singing dunes had attained to the harmony of silence. Allat once a little wisp of seaweed--hardly more than a thread--startedto beat time upon the sands. And then I knew and saw it to be in itshappy beating the pulse that governed the music of the stars. Can theheart conduct the symphony of the body? Tonight the sun set, borneaway--a Grail--by angels from the questing Galahad. There was a greatsilence in my heart as I sat in the crowded room.July 11.A day of northeast wind and upward thunder. The joy of the wind was inme, and I lost the sense of space. The air was so buoyant that it wasclosely kin to the sea. ... Today I succeeded a little better with mywill. I had a strange sensation this afternoon, which told me thatbare lonely places are the only places to write drama, since thereonly can we find the pure dynamic forces of life disentangled from thesubtle and complicated web of human ambitions and interests. The airwas very thin and clear at twilight, but the sun was hidden in theclouds. ...July 12.... There was a great silence this evening in the crowded room.Closing my eyes, I raised the upper lids as far as possible withoutseeing material things, and so saw myself in fearful wonder elevatingthe host and chalice on high. I know now the inner meaning of "Domine,non sum dignus _ut intres sub tecta mea_." Under these two archedroofs of the eyes hidden from all light save Light, there is a secretdwelling. ... A day of close-shrouded palling fog--a chrism confirmingthe strength of beauty.July 13.This morning the wind blew through the fields of grass like countlessangels in the courts of heaven. Shadow and color and light andmovement dancing before the first syllable of the Name. A gull flewdown almost to my hand, and the sunlight thundered in my ears. Lastnight the sea was sadly purifying the earth. I now understand theWasher of the Ford. Majesty lies in darkness, and grief is only theprivilege of seeing Majesty. Today on the porch with closed eyesburied in my hands the winds swept over me in a torrent of livinglight. A symphony is a wonderful symbol. In the first place, it ismusic. In the second place, it is a name of praise with foursyllables. Then it completes a cycle, and returns on a higher plane tothe motif with which it began. It is the history of a soul, and in itslast movement typifies the resurrection of the body, by means of thisvery return,--a return to the order and disposal in which it wascreated and which it now reassumes to praise its Creator for alleternity by the harmony of the original Thought. I looked at twilightinto the tiny white heart of a flower that grew among the grasses, andout of the heart pulsed the Sacred Body in wounds all glorified, withHands outstretched conducting the music of the worlds. I know now thatthe flower was a chalice. The sadness of it cannot die as the Man can,and I know that it is with me ready to be shared. As I write this,there is a mist within my room. I always sleep now like one ready tosoar. In the crowded room tonight I felt myself making the movementsof swimming, as if the air were water and I an expert swimmer.July 14.     _Views of the unveiled heavens alone forth bring Prophets who     cannot sing_.A day of tempestuous wind and rain with all the keen dynamic life oftime poised 'mid eternities. The happiest of my days battling with theelements in wonderful silences. At Mass with wonder the shining of theHost. My eyes were veiled from the chalice, but I felt two angels--guarding the acolytes. Again at the Credo the thunder of _Et Homofactus est_. With Shelley in the afternoon and a perilous walk on thecliffs. ... I am gaining in detachment. The desire and passion forsolitude grows and I meditate a winter on the islands. How unworthy Iam to partake of mysteries! They fill me with fear, for it is hard forthe body to live in eternity. In the evening with Gordon Craig. Is heright about masks? A mask is a symbol, but a face may be a sacrament.The Mass, after all, is the supreme dream and drama of the world.Sadness is majesty, as I found the other night, and majesty is alwaysimpenetrable, for it is a secret full of awe and mysterious silence.Tonight I see that great drama, whether it be a tragedy or no, mustreveal time poised in infinity. Beauty, I think, contains everythingsave the human will, and it is the ideal of the will to be thuscontained and of beauty to be the container. ... In the supreme dramaof Gethsemane and Calvary, Christ used the human body as the supremevisible instrument of drama.July 15.... Tonight the fog broke through the sunset and scattered gold acrossthe sea. Clouds hung over the cliffs. ... I prayed through the sunset,and won a victory for the will.July 16.Last night in the darkness I learned many things. The human will isthe unit, the core of flame which binds all elements together. It issad because it is the force of impact tearing things from theirdetached and comfortable places and placing them in new relations. Itis the magnet, the summoning voice, our own conscience, the expressionof Majesty. It disposes reluctant and conflicting notes in harmony.And we have control of it given into our hands. And then, too, Ilearnt that words are worlds. At every breath, nay, by the slightestthought, we create planets. Pray that they harmonize! They have power.Are they angels? They convey our messages, but their harmony ofinter-woven song and meaning was lost at Babel to our ears. Yet bythem if our will is strong and we do not fail in deeds we may take ourpart in the symphony as truly as life itself. And so we must not usethem idly. How can anyone dare to tell a lie? One begins to see howGod is a Name. I felt before how the secret of language was to befound among the sands. It is because the sands are the nearest andmost visible planets we possess. Words are planets. But planets aresands on the shore of eternity. Words are sands. We are little wordsmade flesh, little echoes in the image of the great Word made Flesh.His creation is the complete echo made flesh, His Image and likenesswhich He contemplates. And so we are in our measure part of the songmade flesh, and the little common words that we use are our brothers.July 17.The sunset tonight was a glorious crucifixion after the day of clouds.It was human in its beckoning. I cannot find the secret of the moon,but it reminds me of Lionel's phrase, if it be his, "goldenmediocrities." Is it the astral embodiment of "They also serve whoonly stand and wait"? Why is it that the little human beauties ofNature pass me by as entities, and that I seek bare places? Is there aparallel in my personal attitude toward all but those who arespecially dear to me? I thought of how I looked down on the city fromthe mountain in May, and felt the whole city to be my prayer. It hadbeen given into my control for a few minutes, and the only worthy useto which I could put it was to offer it up with a prayer for my peopleand all the desire of my heart that the prayer would be answered. Thehalf-million souls with all their dreams were under my care then, andtheir acts were mine. So little are cities, and so little I found myworthiness that I could not hide my tears. Later I crossed to theheight looking down on the cemetery, the world was silent save for theflaming heart of the city pulsing below, and reflecting the FlamingHeart above as the sun set. The woodpeckers did not fear me, and Isank slowly and deeply into God. I think that some day I shall knowHis wounds. I cannot understand why I was delivered from temptation atthe moment that the city was put into my hands.July 18.... I bathed on the dunes on Wonder Island. The sun set tonightsacramentally just as it set that night at ---- when I failed tospeak. Never had I felt stronger, but something held me back fromtelling him how the dearest wish of my life was that he shouldparticipate in the Holy Eucharist. The flame was in my hands to layupon his heart, but something bade me wait. I distrusted it, and askedhim to walk with me on the shore. The thunder of the tide and the moonwere too strong. Why could I not have told him? We were silent forhours while his heart lay with the _Titanic_, and even his littledaughter was quiet in the room.July 19.The stars are the dust rubbed off from human souls. "Dust unto dustthou shalt return." At the last judgment, they will fly together in anangelic hosting, and clothe once more the souls which moved in them,and our souls will rule their songs. Human suffering is the frictionof angels making stars. ... I know now that the end of one's fortydays is not complete knowledge, but only a clear indication of theroad. The joy is in that, and also the sorrow. It is the directiongiven to the will, orders to be so carefully obeyed. This is thegreatest discovery of all. Words do not reveal it. It is absolutelyprosaic, though it is eternal beauty. But what I have written does notreflect it even faintly as it seems to me. Read Hello this afternoon.The freedom of the dunes this morning seemed to extend more than isusual. Later I read from Plato's "Symposium."July 20.... The proverbial symbol of impermanence is writing upon sand. Whatcould be more gloriously permanent? To have one's message spelled outby singing planets, to write upon the stars. It is so that our songshave immortality. "Verba scripta manent" takes on a majesticsignificance. Are not joy and sadness the same? The only difference isone of rapidity. Sadness is made up of the long, slow, majestic chordsof the song. It seems to me that when a wheel seems to cease motion,and finally attains a state of motionlessness, it is perhaps merelyturning into a terrible speed which we cannot perceive. It is theturning of an hour-glass. When I am dead, I wish only my faults to bechronicled, for these alone have any value for the world. I havedreamt always of cycles of infinities. As a decimal always tends byevolution towards a number, so also we evolve toward an infinity. Yetat that goal another infinity starts, as another infinity starts innumbers,--the symbol of patience after all.     "Unto the man of yearning thought     And aspiration, to do nought     Is in itself almost an act,--     Being chasm-fire and cataract     Of the soul's utter depths unseal'd.     Yet woe to thee if once thou yield     Unto the act of doing nought!"Read Hello and Elia. I am learning how to see in crowds. These pastfew days I have succeeded in withdrawing into life for long periods inthe midst of a general conversation, yet my absence was not noted inthe least. Out of it I hope will develop the ability to be with lifealways in the tangle and confusion of city circumstance. Thisafternoon I read _Phaedrus_ aloud on a sunny cliff, and in the eveningread aloud Keats' "I stood tiptoe" on the green heights in the windand the rain. Rossetti's lines do not forbid a life of contemplation,but rather encourage it as distinguished from quietism. ... Throughthe summer I am to see the Crucifixion. How I envy St. Francis theStigmata! Even as a little boy I desired them--but I shall never beable perhaps to love passionately enough. The nights that I cried as alittle fellow without knowing why, just because I loved, were nearerthan I shall ever be again.July 21.At Benediction after Mass today I saw the Wonder in all Humanity withLight surrounding It, and I shook with an awful thunder of sound. ...Today I have been happy to tears, and in the blue afternoon on thecliffs with my mother, I shared "Endymion" and "Epipsychidion." ... Ido not understand why silence is spoken of as a precept. To me it isthe living attribute of God. ... How nobly scornful is Sir Aubrey DeVere's phrase, "witless ecstasies"!July 22.Simply a day of hard work. But I was happy in it. In an odd way I feltas I wrote all day on the smooth white paper that I was stroking thesleek breasts of doves. Tonight the steady patter of the rain upon theeaves.July 23.A day of hard routine work. ... Tonight in the inky darkness I walkedto the postoffice in the thundering wind and rain and surf, andlearned how the deeps can praise the Lord. I have always felt thewonder of that psalm.July 24.Rose at 4:30 and saw the sun rise a pure and shimmering symbol of theHost above the silver outline of Wonder Island. The day was dumb. Alittle boy has come whose face is his sacrament. What a song he mustsing! I look forward to the morrow as a day of special grace andwonder. ...July 25.It is evident to me that music is wrong before a play or duringintermissions. But it is necessary until our dramatists provide someother prelude. That prelude must be a beautiful setting of silence fora few moments showing the protagonist under the light of eternity. Inthe beginning all words contained a spiritual "import,"--were angels.At Babel many fell. Now all our spiritual words are material wordsgrown out of their meanings. When expression becomes passion, it isthe passion of creation, clothing itself in images as God does througheternity in the Passion of Creation. This is near the heart of life'smost awful secret, but words conceal it except from experience. ForPassion proceeds from Creation as Preservation proceeds from both,though they are all from Eternity in the Unity of the Godhead. All myplanets at the contemplation of This are dancing before the throne.The thunderous rhythm of their music is shaking me physically like theengines of a steamer in shallow water. Every atom struggles againstthe law of cohesion. God loves the beautiful boy. His name is HenryR----. The Greeks, Emerson says, called the world _Cosmos_, Beauty.Reading this on the veranda this afternoon, I closed my eyes and sankcontentedly into life. When I returned the faces were foreign, andeven my mother never knew. On the dunes this morning I heard thesilence of Eternity on the edge of time. I think it is a pine forest.Babel took away the Word, until It came to earth, and in material formtook on supreme Spirit coming from the Father. ...July 26.I wish I could raise a singing altar of planets by some greatsacrifice. My fingers drummed upon the sands this morning a crude andsimple rhythm. I thought of its influence in displacing planets, andof the almost infinite musical variations that were set in motion, andthen I compared my crude thrumming with the majestic thunders of thesea, and realized the insupportable beauty of absolute music. A dogtalks by smell. There are vibrations of smell, as well as of sound orof heat or of light. And the blind reveal vibration of touch, theholiest of the senses. We talk now by sound, but are learning to talkby heat and light. When shall we learn to talk by smell and touch?Flowers, too, talk by smell. There is nothing but vibration in theimage of God, for LIFE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE TREMBLING OF HISBEAUTY. The awful speed of Truth hardens into fact. Words must not saymore.A dog taught me this,--Prince, the companion of the silent man. Oneshould be a priest when he marries two ideas. In any one of theplanets within the singing tissue of my flesh are Dantes and St.Francises. Creation requires of us infinite crucifixions which weshall never be able to consummate alone. When I lie on my breasts onthe sand and bury my face in my hands, all Nature receives me as ahuman bridegroom, and I sink through time to eternity _creating_ spacearound me, that widens and narrows to the reaches of immortality. Itis always on the sands that I find the friendliest depths, or in thesnow drift of cold planets upon a winter day or else within in theterrible energy of my body, as my heart beats time to the universalspheral rhythm. Think of the literal meaning of "universal!" Tonightin the silence I read _Prometheus Bound_. I love the grace of theboy's eyes. I pray to be guarded from the pride of humility.July 27.[Illustration: Circle with a cross through it.]... It was a day of silences. I traced this figure idly on the sandtoday, and suddenly understood the symbolism of the scarab. But didthe Egyptians anticipate the Redemption? As men are impressed by theface of the world, so is the world impressed by their faces. The face,as mirror of the soul, shines forth with electricity and makes animpression on life, altering the song of those it acts upon as theviolin sound alters the formation of sands resting on a tighteneddrum. By what ancient intuition does the Latin word "malum" mean both"apple" and "evil"? Music creates substance through the speed ofgaiety, and God in His Creation is a cosmic humorist. (Cosmic meansbeautiful.) To distinguish between fascination and sympathy is acounsel of perfection for critics which has its spiritual analogies.... Angels ran in hosts through the grasses.July 28.     "His soul's most secret thought,     Eternal Light declares."I read Lionel's poems on the cliffs, and almost discovered the secretof the blue. Today for the first time I realized the remoteness ofthese islands, and it was a great joy. It was a golden day of sunshineon the cliffs with blue cloudless sky over quiet waters. Life isturning inward to the heart of silence, and out of it will come thebeauty of my dream if life is willing.July 29. ... I met a man today who knew beauty. He was a French countrylawyer. ... The sunset tonight revealed all the sadness of the BurningBabe. I failed today.July 30.Another sadder failure of the will. Yet beauty came in the evening.The love of man, far more the love of God, is God in heaven descendedupon earth, eternity made time in beauty, "majestic instancy," theWord made Flesh. The soul is the pool wherein God and we see ourimages, and Heaven will be the mutual contemplation of our souls. Sothat human love is the adoration of God in human flesh, and thereinmay the beloved be seen as the image of God in time. The praise of OurLady should then be the praise of God. Was this Patmore's secret? OrDante's and Petrarch's? "My lady was desired in the high heaven." ...I see now how in Heaven there is no marriage or giving in marriage.Far flowing ramparts of a starry world! The _flammantia moenia mundi_of Lucretius. To contemplate Beauty FACE TO FACE! What a wonderfulproof of the beauty of our souls. Twin mirrors of a single singingthought, the face of man looking into the Face of God, soul minglingwith Soul in immortal music, bathed in the cool wind of Our Lady'seyes. Today I lost a nation in the cycle of my soul. What is the bloodbut the history of my planets as engraved upon the constellations ofmy flesh? It is the book of the angel of judgment for the firstsyllable of my song, as the emotions, the intellect, and, alas, thewill, for the second, third, and fourth. The flesh is the ebb tidefrom God, as the emotions are the flood. The intellect is the secondebb, and in the will pray God that it may be flood! The other isHell....July 31.... A victory for the will this morning. ... Tomorrow is the first ofAugust, and I shall enter upon my forty days. The ringing in my earsis the ringing of my fleshly stars "toned all in Time." I havecommenced an anthology of high imaginings more worthy than a book ofessays of that title I have loved and desired to use foryears,--_Flame and Dew_. If rightly done, it may do poetry one of thegreatest of services by assisting it to praise Beauty on many lips innaked Light. I wish to consecrate my work on it to that end. Today Ihave been influenced by Frederick Tennyson, Traherne, and Patmore. Inagony lies the highest music. The key is struck by circumstance,Time's organist, and the stars tremble with music. For the fullthundering silence of Absolute Beauty a Divine Agony was necessary, sothat all Heaven and its choirs and Hell trembled in the majesty ofthis _stricken_ Doom. Death is the final chord, the passage of ourfull song from time to the silence of eternity. Sleep next to death isthe most terrible life that soul and body knows. It is the center ofthe wheel radiating high powers to the circumference. The speed thereis terrific, so fast that it hardens, again that "majestic instancy."The tiniest flame is the friction of conflicting "universes." Beautyis alike the center and circumference of infinity, the silent wheel ofomnipresent omnipotence, wherein all thoughts are not timed buteternal. From eternity we were nothing: to eternity we are Beauty'simage. Is it strange that in sleep we are often given sight?August 1.Art is the exhibition of life in the light of eternity. I can conceiveof no other adequate critical formula. This applies to painting,sculpture, literature and music. Such too is the art of life,--theexhibition to God and man of life in the light of eternity. I havebeen startled to find a kinship between Wordsworth and Millet. I foundit today in a stooped old man who was traveling the roads with awalking stick and a heavy bundle of driftwood. He was worthy of agreat painter or a great poet. By the sign of the cross one draws amagic circle round the soul which evil may not penetrate. It placesone "in the name." On the seashore one should lie parallel with thewaves facing inland. Then only may one advance onward with theirprayer.August 2.It is absolutely true that only music may shape woods and fountainsand the beauty of souls, for it is the only medium of expression whichis pure. Pure music is the true white magic, as black magic is musicmixed with clay by human hands. Naked Beauty alone may mix music withclay in Its own image and likeness. Even poetry fails save in so faras it echoes the pure natural truths of music. And all creation mayflow from a flute if the player breathes a prayer. Some day we shallhave the great opera of the Incarnation and Redemption. It is theideal goal of music, and so of all art. But it demands the poet, thepainter, and the sculptor, too, for its actors shall be immortalstatues and a living chorus singing the passion of the race againstthe supreme dawn and the supreme sunset. But its greatest moments willbe silence. Christ and His Mother will live this silence in the gloryof transfigured stone, and the drama will be played in the open withthe stars above as orchestra, to which the human music will be but abeautiful echo. To this Wagner and Craig point the way. I readPatmore's _Two Infinities_ today with bewilderment and emphaticdisagreement. It seems absolutely lacking in vision, provincial,almost challenging Creation. And yet it is essentially true. Christwas a man of golden mediocrities. He speaks of the lilies of thefield, but never of stars or of planets. And St. Francis perhaps hintsat the solution. To him brother Wind and brother Fire and brother Wormare alike and equal, for he sees them in the light of infinity. Butall are wonderful, and we must not sneer at the stars. ... Todaywriting as a means of expression has seemed to be absolutely futile.Silence is the only active way of praise that I can find, providedthat it informs some daily action. My will won again today. Horizonsare wonderful. S---- told me that Lionel invited him into his Oxfordrooms one evening at sunset and led him to a seat from which nothinglower than the horizon was to be seen. "There," he said, "nothingmatters that is below that line." You see he knew that our souls intheir beauty are always above it.August 3.To watch a grass-blade tapping will teach you wonderful music--thelanguage of the wind. The sunlight running through my flesh in-flamesthe song of the will. I lost myself tonight in the crowded silences.Joy stays with me now, and if I can only join it to sorrow, the willcan then sing simply and freely a continuous song. The turning of thetide is soon to come, and my homesickness for G----ville istransforming itself into a different nostalgia. My planets are risingin song like little candle flames. I wish I possessed their humility.Within me tonight are quiet moonlit waters very full and rich withsilent promises of rest.August 4.At Mass today Mr. C---- showed a fine courtesy serving with the highhumility of a punctilious gentleman. ... Today I saw the body ofChrist, "infinite riches in a little room." The human body of Christin its passion is the sum of all our bodies, and it is this truth towhich pantheism in its blindness dimly beckons. The saints and purepoets and those who have died for friends are the image of the SacredHeart, and in them at moments of pure _reflection_ there is nakedlight and the vision which is insupportable. Hence in the greatestsaints the stigmata. All God's lonely ones are the reflections of Hispain when they attain to sanctity. And holy priests are thereflections of His Hands. Little children and saints may look into HisEyes and see their own. And repentant sinners may reflect His Feet intheir tears. All the births and lives of the earth go to form HisHuman Body, which is vast as Eternity and radiating with Light fromall points and inward to the Heart of Light. To some saints it hasbeen permitted to be the spouse of this body and soul. Magic is whiteor black. White magic is the offspring of spiritual marriage and is asacrament. Black magic is the offspring of unauthorized spiritualcontacts. My frame tonight is possessed by angels dancing before thethrone in a fearfully rapid rhythm. The secret of spiritualachievement is unremitting labor urged without ceasing by a fearfuljoy. No drama is more vast than that of the crucifixion, and yet Ihave seen it all in the heart of a strawberry blossom with wounds allglorified in an ecstasy of living trembling light, and heard thebeating of His Sacred Heart while universe called out to universe inthe anguish of His surrender and all the stars died into the Light ofEternity. The tide has turned.August 5.Today looking into a narrow dome I saw the seeded planets banded bycircles of light whereon they turned. And color changed into silenceat the bidding of the central suns. And these were the eyes of happyinnocence wherein all others died to the Living Light, God being inthem by their childishness. The tide turned yesterday, and today Ihave spent entirely in eternity surrounded by a host of fair-wingedPossibilities, God's angels to humanity. Death is glorified by theirpassage from the future to the past, and we respond by plunging ourlights into the Light wherein it dies. _Abt Vogler_ is the musicalphilosophy of it all. At my first symphony concert as a little boy, Isaw the face of the dying Christ through the wall, and in it the musicof the seventh Symphony sang through the naked eyes calling me inwardto the Sacred Heart. This morning and noon at table I smiled at whitehorizons and in the evening I swam through the Host on my futurewings. We love earth, air, fire, and water now, but the eternal joy ofswimming through the Light of God and reflecting His Light in song andsilence is the infinity of all poets' dreams incarnate in the awfulspeed of Absolute Music. It is the privilege of laughing into the Eyesof God, those Eyes before which the angels veil their faces. It is theprivilege of smelling the blossom of the Living Rose, of tasting andconsuming forever the Body and Blood, of touching the Sacred Knees,and of hearing the Divinity who is Music. Priests and poets shall swimin the song of his heart, and those who have died for friends willreflect its resolving rhythm. How I pity Blake his pride, though hewas preserved from the pride of humility. God will let me see more ofHim in this life than Blake did, though it is of the most triflingsignificance to anticipate eternity in poor time, the crippled heir oforiginal sin. Since it is to be, I wish with all my blood that my willwere worthier.August 6.A day of happy drudgery reading proofs. I rode through them in thewinds of eternity. That is the secret of it all,--to teach us joy. Thehuman symbol of it is a martyr's ecstasy, which is in no way sensuousor voluptuous since it has completely forgotten the body. The SacredHeart is the Mystical Rose spreading its petals over the Cross ofTime. In _Flame and Dew_ is the first application of an idea andbelief that the day will come when anthologies will be bookscontaining the wisdom of the poets on special sciences, such as thescience of childhood, the science of love, the science of death, andthe science of silence.August 7.Imagination being Eternal Life, it shows the blind instinct oflanguage that the word should mean the creation of images. Imaginationis the instrument of God's creation in his own _image_ and likeness.Today I came to Petrarch and Dante--the mystics of the supremeelements. To contrast their serenity with Blake's wrath shows thewhiter heights. All height is inward through narrow circles to theCentral Fire of Silent Love from which the angels shrink in spiralmessages of inspiring flame, and toward which humanity aspires innarrowing and advancing circles of expiring flesh. But depth isoutward to the hearts of men. Sirius sings to my living stars tonightits light in the music of the ancient winds, telling me of thecrucifixion in burning colors of a dying world. Why am I unworthy ofan equal death? The blood runs toward it in a passion of harmony. Theday is near when my morning stars shall sing their lives out togetherin praise of their Creator, though it is futile to measure it in termsof time. One is not curious of time if one lives in eternity. Death isthen only the fulfilment of our operative desires. I wish that I wereone of the tears of God. Joy is for those _of good will_.August 8.I met one of Wordsworth's old men today gathering faggots on theshore. "I have been to all places and cities and I found no one happyon the world, and now I wish me to be dead." ... Tonight I bowed insilence under the vault of stars. To be holy is to lose the knowledgeof good and evil through "clinging Heaven by the hems." To refuse evilis to refuse the apple _(malum)_ of the Tree of Knowledge. There is nopossibility of finding the ideal unless we look passionately fornothing but the beauty of souls, seeing therein God's image andrefusing to perceive the clouds of evil. Circles lead to Heaven, butstraight lines to Hell. Straight lines are the tangents that "err"from the sphere of the ideal. Miss C---- told me about a little boywho was visiting Italy with his mother. He fell down hill, and stoppedbefore a roadside crucifix. And then he forgot his fall. They foundhim crying as if his heart would break, and he told them that it wasbecause he was so sorry for that sad Man whom everybody had madesuffer so. The angels drop seed into our souls which make theminvisible to other men, and we also may plant seed with modesty andhumility. It is God's fernseed to mortals. How strange it is that wemeasure time by moons, cold satellites, and thus the symbol of death.But after all time is the dark night of the soul. I realized for thefirst time today that I was born in December, the month of creation,when the flame turns in upon itself in the hard cold earth and givesbirth to high hopes whose fulfilment are in eternity. It is the monthof Christmas on that account. I have begun to perceive what awfulwings my thoughts have, and know that they are given them by Godthrough me to carry them humbly into the most secret circle of theSacred Breast. We must do the labor of God with human hands, yet theLabor of God is the Creation of Beauty. As the vegetable kingdomrenews its life once a year through time and so preserves its secret,our souls must renew themselves in infinite recurrence througheternity. Our life differs only in ardor which is speed. The greatestspeed lies in submission, for submission is the greatest strength. Athigh moments it is Atlas supporting the earth. At the supreme moment,it becomes the mystery of the Redemption.August 9.Singing through the universal stars that were woven into His Flesh, Isaw the Son of God tonight glorified in the joy of a living Smile. Andall the angels bowed laughing toward Him and clapped and danced beforeHis Name, though the sum of their song was silence. And then everyliving star was scourged by the sins of men, and died into thedarkness, saying "Thy Will be done," and it was morning with theEucharist in the sky. Only Redemption trembled through the air. Thestars are the eternal reflections of God's patience, for they endureHis Human Passion, since together they form the shadow of the Wordmade Flesh. They are the singing echo in time of God's speechlesspatience, as we are destined to be if we conquer our wills. Butpatience is suffering, and Alpha must submit to the yoke of Omega.Since God is the Alpha and Omega he caused the Incarnation andPassion. THE IDEAL OF HUMAN LIFE IS THE PASSIONATE REDEMPTION OF THEWILL. This is life's darkest secret, _unless_ we live in theEucharist. We are to be the silent reflections of speechless patiencein the still waters of eternity. The evil came when Lucifer stole firefrom heaven and brought it down to men. Conquer fire, and we conquerthe will. Then heaven is ours. My body and blood ache with my prayerfor it.August 10.The angels weave what God creates, according to their functions. Hisarchangels are the weavers of time, and all the others of materialnature, uninformed by a soul. This is a branch of the heavenly song.To weave God's image is the function of the saints and of all those onearth. It is the wonder of incarnate Music that saved the world,Absolute Silence born into Sound, and dying with all Sound intoSilence. The archangels are God's messengers of life and death, forthey control the days. But they are sent from Him to His Image, andour weaving is made out of their materials as we adapt them to oursong. All outer powers and forces are brought us by the angels, andamong the dearest to God's heart are his flame-winged Possibilitiesthat hover on the borderline between today and tomorrow, Time andEternity. They alone may not enter time unless we beckon them. Thestarry heaven is the heaven of the body; the crystal sphere, of theintellect; and the empyrean, of the pure soul. We may live in thestarry heaven in this life, if God gives us the grace. But it is thena heaven of desire. But the weaving of the angels is the wholephilosophy of nature. Their music explains its sympathies and sorrows,its deaths and resurrections, and above all its solemn silences ofnight and noon. And the song of their weaving becomes nature's love ofwisdom, that is to say, adoration of the Word. The saints are the onlycomplete philosophers. The object of asceticism is generallymisunderstood, particularly in one phase of its endeavors,--to forgetthe body. The truth of the matter is that the flesh and blood in theirhighest song toward which we should strive are so occupied withpraising God that they completely lack self-consciousness, and do notdistract the intellect or the will. God is with them in naked purity.It is His simplest and dearest starry music. He demands that our lifeshould be a programme of infinite proportions. And yet I wonder if asaint can ever be both a great prophet and a great apostle. I do notbelieve a great prophet can be tender enough to persuade. That is whyprophets are scorned or ignored by their generation. Gentleness is theabsolute breath of music, which alone can penetrate the soul or eventhe material body of nature. The supreme gentleness of St. Francis ofAssisi made the birds listen to his music, for his breath ran dancingin a cool breeze through all their singing stars. We need a St.Francis at present burningly. Is it possible to form a religious orderof the poets? Here is an ideal. But it must be Franciscan: a gown, agirdle, and sandals, poverty, chastity, and obedience. Where is thewise man to obey? I can believe that jewels are potent for good orevil, since they are condensed flame and a secret word lies hidden ineach of their hearts. A day of tempestuous wind and rain.August 11.Today I found myself progressing slowly to a triumphant rhythm roundthe circumference of a vast musical plane. The celestial earth is flatbut progresses upwards to its central point, the cone of aspirationand song. And then I remembered the vision of St. Frances of Romewherein she saw the Supreme Godhead as a vast Circle of Light in themidst of which was a Pillar, the Cone of Redemption and Silence. Deathis the point of meeting. Perhaps the Zodiac is the merry-go-round ofthe stars. A second day of tempest. The great message of future poetrywill be to proclaim that nature is the expression of man, rather thanman of nature, and thus to reveal the essential nobility of man as theimage of God rather than the image of nature. Suns and winds andwaters are what we make them. Pantheism confuses the image of theimage with the face. Nature is the mirror of man as man is the mirrorof God. Nay more, nature is the mirror in time of man's eternity, asman is the image in time and eternity of God. It is for this reasonthat the stars are the open book of the future, though they are not tobe read by men aloud. Astrology is forbidden because it violates theprecept of silence, which is the courtesy we pay as gentlemen to God.We may only read the stars in little children's eyes, wherein theirfuture is concealed. The breast of Mary is the fountain of the stars,and round it fly the seraphim in flaming adoration of the blessedwomb. Her eyes are God's dew, wherein the secret of His Light iswhispered by the thrones. I felt through the morning His humanPresence graciously walking the roads, and I was resting on His leftArm that brought me to His Heart, the country wherein the dreams of mywill are born.August 12.I have been sick today. Rain and tempest, but God was on the wind, andI am happy.August 13.Still ill. Rain and fog with intermittent sunshine. But I am as happyas I have ever been.August 14.Still ill. Fog in the morning breaking into a wonderful pearl day ofsummer haze. Our bodily senses are instruments in our orchestra.August 15.Today I sank into Beauty several times in the sunlight.August 16.Read through the last proofs and on the dunes with my mother in theafternoon I lived in the light of God. The sun I caused to smile and Iwrapped myself in the blue of the Virgin's sky. I found myself causinga shower twice by failing in humility. But the laughing Light of God'seyes in my soul is eternal, and when I submit it controls the tides ofmy body and mind. Tonight a woodpecker alighted on Father K----'sshoulder and stayed with him nearby. The Brahmin may attain to theshadow of the first syllable of the Word. He does not believe thatthere are others. _Om_ is simply the symbol of inward breath,inspiration. I heard myself today very near to the Heart of Silence,whose systole and diastole is the ebb and flow of Love from Eternityto Eternity. Time is the sound of silence and is dead to all eternity.It is the only beautiful death that the angels do not mourn, for inthe death of Time is the Redemption of the World. It takes the circleof eternity to unite the four points of the cross, and a crucifixionto unite two parallel lines.August 17.Out of the summer I am weaving the pattern web of the future inthreads of desire. Every resurrection of a body is the last judgmentof infinite planets, which fly to or flee from the human song of God'sfirst syllable. Yet those that flee may be purchased by an infiniteRedemption. This opens a terrible possibility of mercy. Is Godcontinually becoming man for the love of His image? This is the joyfulsecret of God's sad fourth syllable. I clothe it in words to guard itfrom my intellect. Infinite incarnations prove time an illusion, sincethey make it eternity. God's Sacred Heart is the silent ocean beyondthe universe. It reflects. The Incarnation is its flood. The Hosttonight was more white than shining silver in a lonely pearl sky. Itwas Absolute Music unveiled to the human eye. Tonight I stood out forlong alone with the stars, and watched a thunderstorm come over thesea. We must guard our dreams and intuitions not only from theintellects of others but most of all from our own. Yet our faith mustbe precisely bounded, although this boundary is to be none other thanthe infinite succession of points where time and eternity meet and bowdown before God. This morning I saw His Beauty in a daisy. ... I donot believe that God will reveal His mysteries if we seek to knowthem, without inflicting a penalty. The way of knowledge is the way ofsilent patience, which lies quietly dreaming of Love till the floodwashes it with Living Light.August 18.Every time we look into another's soul we may enter Paradise. There isan indescribable grace in the air this first day of prescient autumn.The summer has taught me the secret of loneliness and the infinite wayof satisfying its desire. To be alone with God we must be intimatewith the beauty in the eyes of every face, and yet absolutely detachedsave from one's family and friend. Life's ideal is to see the end inthe beginning, and act the road between. This is no other than theeternal life of the Alpha and Omega. But the essence of it in time isthat the whole tide of humanity should ebb and flow in our breast. Itrequires a crucifixion to drink in all its saltness. I found the dunesbeyond the lagoon this morning and sank into God in the wind of thesunlit blue. When I returned, the people were coming from Church.Tonight the Host was quivering gold, and as I write the planets areringing in my ears. I pray that at the end I may come to the Heart ofEternal Silence.August 19.On the dunes this morning toward Wonder Island ... Eternity isinfinite speed. Time is the dragwheel, nothing more. Hence thesignificance of "when eternity reaffirms the conception of an hour."Flame is the symbol of time as dew is the symbol of eternity. Theymeet in Christ and through Him in the human race. The moon properlyloved is the kindness of time, as the sun is the reflected love ofEternity made Flesh in the Host on the altar. ... Tonight I desireonly silence to love.August 20.On the dunes toward Wonder Island this morning I lost space and walkedupon the blue ringing a cycle of stars in either hand. But I felt nosense of distance and the seed of the sands blew on the wind whichcarried me. It taught me how to walk softly through life, and cominghome I had the sand in my hair. I know now what clouds are, softerthan the breasts of doves. God's flying sorrows are the sandals of thesoul. They make us His angels, Mercuries of Light. The sun has notbled for many a night, but has slowly descended in silver splendor,always a second dawn with its fresh, keen, cool surprises. Today wasthe grace of last night's desire. The wonder of it this morning was mycomplete surrender, the assurance with which I moved on the singingskies as my native element. I know that only the appearances remained,as in the Eucharist after the Consecration we seem to see the breadand wine. Life was the poise of infinity, and I knew of no horizon,for I could look down upon the dawn. It came two weeks ago Sunday inmy heart. I see the mystery of the Resurrection in its beauty, and whywhite lilies are its deepest symbol. How can there be a prison or acage? Every twilight is a white horizon. The gulls know that and thesea tonight has lost its sorrow.August 21.By sailboat to P---- and G---- with the silent man, returning with thestars. Their hosting was like the flocking of wild geese, and theyfollowed St. Francis of Assisi as a leader, the captain of the morningstars. In the silence I heard the operation of the divine mathematics.I loved those Chaldean seers to whom God talked directly and wrote Hismessage upon the stars. I lay prone on the deck looking upwards andfell into the Divine Ocean slowly. The moon rode serenely to thesouthwest, and humanity was with me in the boat. Navigators are nowthe only men left wise enough to follow the stars. The sunpath wasJacob's ladder, and the Aran islanders know its secret when they seeTir-n'an-Og in the west on calm sunset evenings. The sea had my trust,eternal through yesterday's experience, and I believe that if faithand good works required it of me, I could walk softly over it. If thesoul is to control the body, surely spiritual gravity should be ableto overcome material gravity. Certainly it would take more than thesea to quench my flame, if God made me worthy.August 22.I looked down from great heights today on all the little smilingintimacies. They are like happy babies to me, and my speech shouldplay with them, if I can ever become worthy of their simplicity. Therhythm of all music is the systole and diastole of the Sacred Heart,which is the ebb and flow of an infinite ocean. This is the meaning, Ithink, of the old Gaelic rune, _Ri tragadh s'ri lionadh, mar a bha,mar a tha, mar a bhitheas gu bragh ri traghadh s'ri lionadh_. (The ebband the flow, as it was, as it is, as it ever shall be, the ebb andthe flow.) The resolute gaze of the soul toward this in loveconstitutes prayer in its only form. It shows blood to be the mostrich and beautiful of human things, and its salt waves purify theflesh, as the salt waves of Gethsemane and Calvary redeemed the souland its singing stars.August 23.My life so far has been a word, and not a deed. But the world was notredeemed until the Word BECAME FLESH--AND DWELT AMONGST US. Mary S----met us on the roads today and said, "I hope that we'll be meeting inHeaven, we seem to meet so often now." I sleep at night in a cruciformposition adoring beauty with every faculty save my will, the mostnecessary of all.August 24.In the open today amid a hurricane of wind ... I walked with achildish old man with a pleasant soul. The wind brought meteor showersof beauty to the body. It rained grace in the sky of noon.I could carry overflowing happiness now even to New York. Todayreminded me of the sunlight on the roar of Broadway. God is on thewind tonight, and is beating down my will with his wings.August 25.I lay through a night of tempestuous wind with the open window at myhead. I awoke and saw myself face to face in my weakness. It rainedall day. ... I can hardly bear my love today. It is a terrific dynamoof silence. But it will be very long before I shall fulfill myworthiness. If one could always remember that he is a saviour, andcarry humanity with him, his will would be inflexible and every act anexulting humility. All nature is but a mantle which the wind of myspirit disposes in folds about me, and humanity is the chalice inwhich I may communicate with God,--a chalice woven of our singingflesh and heart and brain and will, wherein the will is its depth, theAtlas which bears the Sacred Body and Blood when it is given to us.August 26.Sorrow has come at last. Full moon, and life is at the flood. Theprecept of all adversity is of course that the ebb tide of fortune isour flood toward God. Even the lamp tonight is singing in the room.August 27.The experience still turns inward to the heart of life. I now see thecore of it. It burns, of course, but think of the wheel it carries. Afew days ago I was on the circumference. Now I have found the center.A day of rain and wind and exterior disturbances. But I have found mycenacle.August 28.A victory for the will. ... It is strange that every vital lesson thatexperience teaches can never be expressed in words. The past few dayshave taught me more than the rest of the summer. There will always bea secrecy of the soul, and what this contains constitutes God's imageand likeness. Life sings tonight in every atom its marvelous chemistryof change and prophecy. Nature knows no elegies, since it may nevertriumph over aught but dust. But the highest dream is less worthy thanthe simplest deed, and we must forget the knowledge of good and evil.I would exchange all the knowledge I have gained for the grace toperform the slightest act of St. Francis. God has made our opportunityinfinite by giving us an eternal standard of values,--that is all.August 29.I am afraid to write further for fear that I shall soon becomeself-conscious. ... It is strange that the will did not come home tome as a complete experience before. I simply had the foreboding of it.This summer on the 9th of August I heard the Fourth Syllable in itsawfulness for the first time, and understood the mystery of theRedemption. The time has now come to close this book, for the recordis complete, and may not be reopened until I redeem my will._They departed into their own country another way_.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FORGOTTEN THRESHOLD********** This file should be named 13138.txt or 13138.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/1/3/13138Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It may, therefore, be askedto what purpose is the story which follows, of the experiences of oneperson under that dead and accursed institution? To such question, if itbe asked, it may be answered that the narrator presents his story incompliance with the suggestion of friends, and in the hope that it mayadd something of accurate information regarding the character andinfluence of an institution which for two hundred years dominated thecountry--exercising a potent but baneful influence in the formation ofits social, civil and industrial structures, and which finally plungedit into the most stupendous civil war which the world has ever known. Asthe enlightenment of each generation depends upon the thoughtful studyof the history of those that have gone before, everything which tends tofullness and accuracy in that history is of value, even though it be notpresented with the adjuncts of literary adornment, or thrilling sceniceffects.CHAPTER I.LIFE ON A COTTON PLANTATION.       *       *       *       *       *BIRTH--SOLD IN A RICHMOND SLAVE PEN.I was born in Virginia, in 1832, near Charlottesville, in the beautifulvalley of the Rivanna river. My father was a white man and my mother anegress, the slave of one John Martin. I was a mere child, probably notmore than six years of age, as I remember, when my mother, two brothersand myself were sold to Dr. Louis, a practicing physician in the villageof Scottsville. We remained with him about five years, when he died,and, in the settlement of his estate, I was sold to one WashingtonFitzpatrick, a merchant of the village. He kept me a short time when hetook me to Richmond, by way of canal-boat, expecting to sell me; but asthe market was dull, he brought me back and kept me some three monthslonger, when he told me he had hired me out to work on a canal-boatrunning to Richmond, and to go to my mother and get my clothes ready tostart on the trip. I went to her as directed, and, when she had madeready my bundle, she bade me good-by with tears in her eyes, saying: "Myson, be a good boy; be polite to every one, and always behave yourselfproperly." It was sad to her to part with me, though she did not knowthat she was never to see me again, for my master had said nothing toher regarding his purpose and she only thought, as I did, that I washired to work on the canal-boat, and that she should see meoccasionally. But alas! We never met again. I can see her form still aswhen she bade me good-bye. That parting I can never forget. I ran offfrom her as quickly as I could after her parting words, for I did notwant her to see me crying. I went to my master at the store, and heagain told me that he had hired me to work on the canal-boat, and to goaboard immediately. Of the boat and the trip and the scenes along theroute I remember little--I only thought of my mother and my leaving her.When we arrived at Richmond, George Pullan, a "nigger-trader," as he wascalled, came to the boat and began to question me, asking me first if Icould remember having had the chickenpox, measles or whooping-cough. Ianswered, yes. Then he asked me if I did not want to take a little walkwith him. I said, no. "Well," said he, "you have got to go. Your mastersent you down here to be sold, and told me to come and get you and takeyou to the trader's yard, ready to be sold." I saw that to hesitate wasuseless; so I at once obeyed him and went.       *       *       *       *       *A SLAVE MARKET.The trader's establishment consisted of an office, a large show-room anda yard in the rear enclosed with a wall of brick fifteen feet high. Theprincipal men of the establishment were the proprietor and the foreman.When slaves were to be exhibited for sale, the foreman was called to theoffice by means of a bell, and an order given him to bring into theshow-room all the slaves in the establishment. This was the work of buta few minutes, and the women were placed in a row on one side of theroom and the men on the other. Persons desirous of purchasing thempassed up and down between the lines looking the poor creatures over,and questioning them in about the following manner: "What can you do?""Are you a good cook? seamstress? dairymaid?"--this to the women, whilethe men would be questioned as to their line of work: "Can you plow? Areyou a blacksmith? Have you ever cared for horses? Can you pick cottonrapidly?" Sometimes the slave would be required to open his mouth thatthe purchaser might examine the teeth and form some opinion as to hisage and physical soundness; and if it was suspected that a slave hadbeen beaten a good deal he would be required to step into another roomand undress. If the person desiring to buy found the slave badly scarredby the common usage of whipping, he would say at once to the foreman;"Why! this slave is not worth much, he is all scarred up. No, I don'twant him; bring me in another to look at." Slaves without scars fromwhipping and looking well physically always sold readily. They werenever left long in the yard. It was expected that all the slaves in theyard for sale would be neatly dressed and clean before being broughtinto the show-room. It was the foreman's business to see that each onewas presentable.       *       *       *       *       *SLAVE WHIPPING AS A BUSINESS.Whipping was done at these markets, or trader's yards, all the time.People who lived in the city of Richmond would send their slaves herefor punishment. When any one wanted a slave whipped he would send a noteto that effect with the servant to the trader. Any petty offense on thepart of a slave was sufficient to subject the offender to this brutaltreatment. Owners who affected culture and refinement preferred to senda servant to the yard for punishment to inflicting it themselves. Itsaved them trouble, they said, and possibly a slight wear and tear offeeling. For this service the owner was charged a certain sum for eachslave, and the earnings of the traders from this source formed a verylarge part of the profits of his business. The yard I was in had aregular whipping post to which they tied the slave, and gave him"nine-and-thirty," as it was called, meaning thirty-nine lashes as hardas they could lay it on. Men were stripped of their shirts inpreparation for the whipping, and women had to take off their dressesfrom the shoulders to the waist. These whippings were not so severe aswhen the slaves were stripped entirely of their clothes, as wasgenerally the case on the plantations where slaves were owned by thedozen. I saw many cases of whipping while I was in the yard. Sometimes Iwas so frightened that I trembled violently, for I had never seenanything like it before.       *       *       *       *       *SOLD IN THE MARKET.I was only in the yard a short time before I was bought by one GeorgeReid who lived in Richmond. He had no wife, but an old lady kept housefor him and his three sons. At this time he had a place in thepostoffice, but soon after I came there he lost it. He then moved intothe country upon a farm of about one thousand acres, enclosed by a cedarhedge. The house was a plain frame structure upon a stone basement andcontained four rooms. It was surrounded with shrubbery, and was apleasant country seat. But I did not like it here. I grieved continuallyabout my mother. It came to me, more and more plainly, that I wouldnever see her again. Young and lonely as I was, I could not help crying,oftentimes for hours together. It was hard to get used to being awayfrom my mother. I remember well "Aunt Sylvia," who was the cook in theReid household. She was very kind to me and always spoke consolingly tome, especially if I had been blue, and had had one of my fits of crying.At these times she would always bake me an ash cake for supper, sayingto me; "My child, don't cry; 'Aunt Sylvia' will look after you." Thisash cake was made of corn meal and water, a little salt to make itpalatable, and was baked by putting it between cabbage leaves andcovering it with hot ashes. A sweeter or more delicious cake one couldnot desire, and it was common upon the tables of all the Virginiafarmers. I always considered it a great treat to get one of these cakesfrom "Aunt Sylvia."The appellations of "aunt" and "uncle" for the older slaves were notonly common among the blacks, but the whites also addressed them in thesame way.       *       *       *       *       *ON THE AUCTION BLOCKI was sick a great deal--in fact, I had suffered with chills and feverever since Mr. Reid bought me. He, therefore, concluded to sell me, and,in November, 1844, he took me back to Richmond, placing me in theExchange building, or auction rooms, for the sale of slaves. The saleswere carried on in a large hall where those interested in the businesssat around a large block or stand, upon which the slave to be sold wasplaced, the auctioneer standing beside him. When I was placed upon theblock, a Mr. McGee came up and felt of me and asked me what I could do."You look like a right smart nigger," said he, "Virginia always producesgood darkies." Virginia was the mother of slavery, and it was held bymany that she had the best slaves. So when Mr. McGee found I was bornand bred in that state he seemed satisfied. The bidding commenced, andI remember well when the auctioneer said; "Three hundred eightydollars--once, twice and sold to Mr. Edward McGee." He was a rich cottonplanter of Pontotoc, Miss. As near as I can recollect, I was not morethan twelve years of age, so did not sell for very much.       *       *       *       *       *PRICE OF SLAVES.Servant women sold for 500 to 700, and sometimes as high as 800 whenpossessing extra qualifications. A house maid, bright in looks, strongand well formed, would sell for 1,000 to 1,200. Bright mulatto girls,well versed in sewing and knitting, would sometimes bring as high as1,800, especially if a Virginian or a Kentuckian. Good blacksmiths soldfor 1,600 to 1,800. When the slaves were put upon the block they werealways sold to the highest bidder. Mr. McGee, or "Boss," as I soonlearned to call him, bought sixty other slaves before he bought me, andthey were started in a herd for Atlanta, Ga., on foot.       *       *       *       *       *STARTED FOR A COTTON PLANTATION.Boss, myself and ten others met them there. We then started forPontotoc, Miss. On our way we stopped at Edenton, Ga., where Boss soldtwenty-one of the sixty slaves. We then proceeded on our way, Boss byrail and we on foot, or in the wagon. We went about twenty miles a day.I remember, as we passed along, every white man we met was yelling,"Hurrah for Polk and Dallas!" They were feeling good, for election hadgiven them the men that they wanted. The man who had us in charge joinedwith those we met in the hurrahing. We were afraid to ask them thereason for their yelling, as that would have been regarded as animpertinence, and probably would have caused us all to be whipped.       *       *       *       *       *MY MISSISSIPPI HOME.At length, after a long and wearisome journey, we reached Pontotoc,McGee's home, on Christmas eve. Boss took me into the house and into thesitting room, where all the family were assembled, and presented me as aChristmas gift to the madam, his wife.My boss, as I remember him, was a tall, raw-boned man, but ratherdistinguished in looks, with a fine carriage, brilliant in intellect,and considered one of the wealthiest and most successful planters of histime. Mrs. McGee was a handsome, stately lady, about thirty years ofage, brunette in complexion, faultless in figure and imperious inmanner. I think that they were of Scotch descent. There were fourchildren, Emma, Willie, Johnnie and Jimmie. All looked at me, andthought I was "a spry little fellow." I was very shy and did not saymuch, as everything was strange to me. I was put to sleep that night ona pallet on the floor in the dining room, using an old quilt as acovering. The next morning was Christmas, and it seemed to be a customto have egg-nog before breakfast. The process of making this was new andinteresting to me. I saw them whip the whites of eggs, on a platter, toa stiff froth; the yolks were thoroughly beaten in a large bowl, sugarand plenty of good brandy were added, and the whites of the eggs andcream were then stirred in, a little nutmeg grated on top of each glasswhen filled for serving. This was a delicious drink, and the best of allwas, there was plenty of it. I served this to all the family, and, asthere were also visiting relatives present, many glasses were required,and I found the tray so heavy I could hardly carry it. I helped myself,after the service was finished, and I was delighted, for I had nevertasted anything so fine before.My boss told me I was to wait on the madam, do any errand necessary,attend to the dining room--in fact I was installed as general utilityboy. It was different from the quiet manner of life I had seen beforecoming here--it kept my spirits up for some time. I thought of my motheroften, but I was gradually growing to the idea that it was useless tocry, and I tried hard to overcome my feelings.       *       *       *       *       *PLANTATION LIFE.As already stated, it was Christmas morning, and, after breakfast, I sawthe cook hurrying, and when I went out into the yard, everywhere Ilooked slaves met my view. I never saw so many slaves at one timebefore. In Virginia we did not have such large farms. There were noextensive cotton plantations, as in Mississippi. I shall never forgetthe dinner that day--it was a feast fit for a king, so varied and lavishwas the bill of fare. The next attraction for me was the farm handsgetting their Christmas rations. Each was given a pint of flour of whichthey made biscuit, which were called "Billy Seldom," because biscuitwere very rare with them. Their daily food was corn bread, which theycalled "Johnny Constant," as they had it constantly. In addition to theflour each received a piece of bacon or fat meat, from which they gotthe shortening for their biscuit. The cracklings from the rendering oflard were also used by the slaves for shortening. The hands were allowedfour days off at Christmas, and if they worked on these days, as some ofthem did, they got fifty cents a day for chopping. It was not common tohave chopping done during the holidays; some planters, however, found itconvenient thus to get it out of the way for the work which came afterChristmas.       *       *       *       *       *THE GREAT HOUSE.I soon became familiar with my work in the house and with theneighborhood, as I often had to carry notes for Boss to neighboringfarmers, as well as to carry the mail to and from the postoffice. The"great house," as the dwelling of the master was called, was two storieshigh, built of huge logs, chinked and daubed and whitewashed. It wasdivided, from front to rear, by a hall twenty-five feet long and twelvefeet wide, and on each side of the hall, in each story, was one largeroom with a large fire-place. There were but four rooms in all, yetthese were so large that they were equal to at least six of our modernrooms. The kitchen was not attached to the main building, but was aboutthirty feet to the rear. This was the common mode of building in thesouth in those days. The two bedrooms upstairs were very plain infurnishings, but neat and comfortable, judged by the standard of thetimes. A wing was added to the main building for dining room. In rear ofthe kitchen was the milk or dairy house, and beyond this the smoke housefor curing the meat. In line with these buildings, and still further tothe rear, was the overseer's house. Near the milk house was a largetree, and attached to the trunk was a lever; and here was where thechurning was done, in which I had always to assist. This establishmentwill serve as a sample of many of those on the large plantations in thesouth. The main road from Pontotoc to Holly Springs, one of the greatthoroughfares of the state and a stage route, passed near the house, andthrough the center of the farm. On each side of this road was a fence,and in the corners of both fences, extending for a mile, were plantedpeach trees, which bore excellent fruit in great profusion.       *       *       *       *       *HOUSE SERVANT AND ERRAND BOY.My first work in the morning was to dust the parlor and hall and arrangethe dining room. It came awkward to me at first, but, after the madamtold me how, I soon learned to do it satisfactorily. Then I had to waiton the table, sweep the large yard every morning with a brush broom andgo for the mail once a week. I used to get very tired, for I was youngand consequently not strong. Aside from these things which cameregularly, I had to help the madam in warping the cloth. I dreaded thiswork, for I always got my ears boxed if I did not or could not do thework to suit her. She always made the warp herself and put it in, and Ihad to hand her the thread as she put it through the harness. I wouldget very tired at this work and, like any child, wanted to be at play,but I could not remember that the madam ever gave me that privilege.Saddling the horse at first was troublesome to me, but Boss was constantin his efforts to teach me, and, after many trials, I learned the tasksatisfactorily to the master and to bring the horse to the door when hewished to go out for business or pleasure. Riding horseback was commonfor both ladies and gentlemen, and sometimes I would have to saddlethree or more horses when Boss, the madam, a friend or friends desired aride. Bird hunting parties were common and were greatly enjoyed, by theyoung people especially. Boss always invited some of the young people ofthe neighborhood to these parties and they never failed to put in anappearance. Williams, Bradford and Freeman were the sons of richplanters, and were always participants in this sport, and their younglady friends joined in it as on-lookers. The young men singing andwhistling to the birds, I in the meantime setting the net. As soon as Ihad got the net in order they would approach the birds slowly, drivingthem into it. There was great laughter and excitement if they weresuccessful in catching a fine flock.       *       *       *       *       *CRUEL TREATMENT.I was but a lad, yet I can remember well the cruel treatment I received.Some weeks it seemed I was whipped for nothing, just to please mymistress' fancy. Once, when I was sent to town for the mail and hadstarted back, it was so dark and rainy my horse got away from me and Ihad to stay all night in town. The next morning when I got back home Ihad a severe whipping, because the master was expecting a lettercontaining money and was disappointed in not receiving it that night, ashe was going to Panola to spend Christmas. However, the day came and allthe family went except me. During the time they were gone the overseerwhipped a man so terribly with the "bull whip" that I had to go for thedoctor, and when Dr. Heningford, the regular family physician, came, hesaid it was awful--such cruel treatment, and he complained about it. Itwas common for a slave to get an "over-threshing," that is, to bewhipped too much. The poor man was cut up so badly all over that thedoctor made a bran poultice and wrapped his entire body in it. This wasdone to draw out the inflammation. It seems the slave had been sick, andhad killed a little pig when he became well enough to go to work, as hisappetite craved hearty food, and he needed it to give him strength forhis tasks. For this one act, comparatively trivial, he was almostkilled. The idea never seemed to occur to the slave holders that theseslaves were getting no wages for their work and, therefore, had nothingwith which to procure what, at times, was necessary for their health andstrength--palatable and nourishing food. When the slaves took anythingthe masters called it stealing, yet they were stealing the slaves' timeyear after year. When Boss came home he was called on by the townofficials, for the case had been reported to them. Boss, however, gotout of it by saying that he was not at home when the trouble occurred.The poor slave was sick from his ill treatment some four or five months,and when he recovered there was a running sore left on his body, fromthe deep cuts of the whip, which never healed. I can not forget how helooked, the sore was a sickening sight; yet, when he was able to walk hehad to return to work in the field.I had not been at Pontotoc very long when I saw the hounds run a slave,by name Ben Lyon. "Old Ben," as he was called, ran away and had beengone a week when he was seen by a woman who "told on him," and then Iwas sent to get the man who had trained dogs, or hounds as they werecalled. The dogs ran the slave about ten miles when they lost track at acreek, but he was caught that night in a farmer's house gettingsomething to eat.       *       *       *       *       *INSTRUCTIONS IN MEDICINE.After some time, Boss began to tell me the names of medicines and theirproperties. I liked this and seemed to grasp the idea very well. Aftergiving me a number of names he would make me repeat them. Then he wouldtell me the properties of each medicine named, how it was used and forwhat purpose and how much constituted a dose. He would drill me in allthis until I knew it and, in a short time, he would add other names tothe list. He always showed me each medicine named and had me smell andcarefully examine it that I might know it when seen again. I liked this,and used to wish that I was as wise as my master. He was very precise,steady and gentle in any case of sickness, and, although he had longretired from the medical world, all recognized his merit wherever hewent. I used to go to the woods and gather slippery elm, alum root andthe roots of wild cherry and poplar, for we used all these incompounding medicines for the servants.       *       *       *       *       *THE OVERSEER--WHIPPINGS AND OTHER CRUELTIES.The overseer was a man hired to look after the farm and whip the slaves.Very often they were not only cruel, but barbarous. Every farmer orplanter considered an overseer a necessity. As a rule, there was also oneach plantation, a foreman--one of the brighter slaves, who was heldresponsible for the slaves under him, and whipped if they did not comeup to the required task. There was, too, a forewoman, who, in likemanner, had charge of the female slaves, and also the boys and girlsfrom twelve to sixteen years of age, and all the old people that werefeeble. This was called the trash gang. Ah! it would make one's heartache to see those children and how they were worked. Cold, frostymornings, the little ones would be crying from cold; but they had tokeep on. Aunt Polly, our forewoman, was afraid to allow them to run toget warm, for fear the overseer would see them. Then she would bewhipped, and he would make her whip all of the gang. At length, I becameused to severe treatment of the slaves; but, every little whilesomething would happen to make me wish I were dead. Everything was in abustle--always there was slashing and whipping. I remember when Bossmade a change in our overseer. It was the beginning of the year. Riley,one of the slaves, who was a principal plower, was not on hand for workone Monday morning, having been delayed in fixing the bridle of hismule, which the animal, for lack of something better, perhaps, had beenvigorously chewing and rendered nearly useless. He was, therefore,considerably behind time, when he reached the field. Without waiting tolearn what was the reason for the delay, the overseer sprang upon himwith his bull whip, which was about seven feet long, lashing him withall his strength, every stroke leaving its mark upon the poor man'sbody, and finally the knot at the end of the whip buried itself in thefleshy part of the arm, and there came around it a festering sore. Hesuffered greatly with it, until one night his brother took out the knot,when the poor fellow was asleep, for he could not bear any one to touchit when he was awake. It was awful to hear the cracking of that whip asit was laid about Riley--one would have thought that an ox team hadgotten into the mire, and was being whipped out, so loud and sharp wasthe noise!I usually slept in the dining room on the floor. Early one morning anold slave, by name of "Uncle Jim," came and knocked at the window, andupon my jumping up and going to him, he told me to tell Boss that UncleJim was there. He had run away, some time before, and, for some reason,had returned. Boss, upon hearing the news, got up and sent me to tellthe overseer to come at once. He came, and, taking the bull whip, acowhide and a lot of peach-tree switches, he and Boss led Uncle Jim backinto the cow lot, on the side of the hill, where they drove four stakesin the ground, and, laying him flat on his face, tied his hands and feetto these stakes. After whipping him, in this position, all they wantedto, a pail of strong salt and water was brought, and the poor fellow was"washed down." This washing was customary, after whippings, as theplanters claimed it drew out all the soreness, and healed the laceratedflesh.Upon one occasion, the family being away, I was left extra work to do,being set to help three fellow slaves lay off the rows for plantingcorn. We did not get them quite straight. The deviation we made from theline was very little, and could scarcely be seen, even by an expert; butthe least thing wrong about the work would cause any slave to bewhipped, and so all four of us were flogged.       *       *       *       *       *THE SLAVE CABIN.There was a section of the plantation known as "the quarters," wherewere situated the cabins of the slaves. These cabins were built of roughlogs, and daubed with the red clay or mud of the region. No attempt wasmade to give them a neat appearance--they were not even whitewashed.Each cabin was about fourteen feet square, containing but one room, andwas covered with oak boards, three feet in length, split out of logs byhand. These boards were not nailed on, but held in their places by whatwere termed weight-poles laid across them at right angles. There werein each room two windows, a door and a large, rude fire-place. The doorand window frames, or facings, were held in their places by wooden pins,nails being used only in putting the doors together. The interior of thecabins had nothing more attractive than the outside--there was noplastering and only a dirt floor. The furniture consisted of one bed, aplain board table and some benches made by the slaves themselves.Sometimes a cabin was occupied by two or more families, in which casethe number of beds was increased proportionately. For light a greaselamp was used, which was made of iron, bowl shaped, by a blacksmith. Thebowl was filled with grease and a rag or wick placed in it, one endresting on the edge for lighting. These lamps gave a good light, andwere in general use among the slaves. Tallow candles were a luxury,never seen except in the "great houses" of the planters. The only lightfor outdoors used by the slaves was a torch made by binding together abundle of small sticks or splinters.       *       *       *       *       *COTTON RAISING.After the selection of the soil most suitable for cotton, thepreparation of it was of vital importance. The land was deeply plowed,long enough before the time for planting to allow the spring rains tosettle it. Then it was thrown into beds or ridges by turning furrowsboth ways toward a given center. The seed was planted at the rate of onehundred pounds per acre. The plant made its appearance in about ten daysafter planting, if the weather was favorable. Early planting, however,followed by cold, stormy weather frequently caused the seed to rot. Assoon as the third leaf appeared the process of scraping commenced, whichconsisted of cleaning the ridge with hoes of all superfluous plants andall weeds and grass. After this a narrow plow known as a "bull tongue,"was used to turn the loose earth around the plant and cover up any grassnot totally destroyed by the hoes. If the surface was very rough thehoes followed, instead of preceding, the plow to unearth those plantsthat may have been partially covered. The slaves often acquired greatskill in these operations, running plows within two inches of thestalks, and striking down weeds within half an inch with their hoes,rarely touching a leaf of the cotton. Subsequent plowing, alternatingwith hoeing, usually occurred once in twenty days. There was danger indeep plowing of injuring the roots, and this was avoided, except in themiddle of rows in wet seasons when it was necessary to bury and moreeffectually kill the grass. The implements used in the culture of cottonwere shovels, hoes, sweeps, cultivators, harrows and two kinds of plows.It required four months, under the most favorable circumstances, forcotton to attain its full growth. It was usually planted about the 1stof April, or from March 20th to April 10th, bloomed about the 1st ofJune and the first balls opened about August 15th, when pickingcommenced. The blooms come out in the morning and are fully developed bynoon, when they are a pure white. Soon after meridian they begin toexhibit reddish streaks, and next morning are a clear pink. They falloff by noon of the second day.       *       *       *       *       *THE COTTON WORM.A cut worm was troublesome sometimes; but the plants were watched verycarefully, and as soon as any signs of worms were seen work for theirdestruction was commenced. The majority of the eggs were laid upon thecalyx and involucre. The worm, after gnawing through its enclosed shell,makes its first meal upon the part of the plant upon which the egg waslaid, be it leaf, stem or involucre. If it were laid upon the leaf, aswas usually the case, it might be three days before the worm reached theboll; but were the eggs laid upon the involucre the worm pierced throughwithin twenty-four hours after hatching. The newly hatched boll wormwalks like a geometrical larva or looper, a measuring worm as it wascalled. This is easily explained by the fact that while in the fullgrown worm the abdominal legs, or pro legs, are nearly equal in length,in the newly hatched worm the second pair are slightly shorter than thethird, and the first pair are shorter and slenderer than the second--astate of things approaching that in the full grown cotton worm, thoughthe difference in size in the former case is not nearly so marked as inthe latter. This method of walking is lost with the first or secondmolt. There is nothing remarkable about these young larvae. They seem tobe thicker in proportion to their length than the young cotton worms,and they have not so delicate and transparent an appearance. Their headsare black and their bodies seem already to have begun to vary in color.The body above is furnished with sparse, stiff hairs, each arising froma tubercle. I have often watched the newly hatched boll while in thecotton fields. When hatched from an egg which had been deposited upon aleaf, they invariably made their first meal on the substance of theleaf, and then wandered about for a longer or shorter space of time,evidently seeking a boll or flower bud. It was always interesting towatch this seemingly aimless search of the young worm, crawling firstdown the leaf stem and then back, then dropping a few inches by a silkenthread and then painfully working its way back again, until, at last, itfound the object of its search, or fell to the ground where it wasdestroyed by ants. As the boll worms increase in size a most wonderfuldiversity of color and marking becomes apparent. In color differentworms will vary from a brilliant green to a deep pink or dark brown,exhibiting almost every conceivable intermediate stage from animmaculate, unstriped specimen to one with regular spots and manystripes. The green worms were more common than those of any othercolor--a common variety was a very light green. When these worms put inan appearance it raised a great excitement among the planters. We didnot use any poison to destroy them, as I learn is the method nowemployed.       *       *       *       *       *THE COTTON HARVEST.The cotton harvest, or picking season, began about the latter part ofAugust or first of September, and lasted till Christmas or after, but inthe latter part of July picking commenced for "the first bale" to gointo the market at Memphis. This picking was done by children from nineto twelve years of age and by women who were known as "sucklers," thatis, women with infants. The pickers would pass through the rows gettingvery little, as the cotton was not yet in full bloom. From the lowerpart of the stalk where it opened first is where they got the firstpickings. The season of first picking was always a great time, for theplanter who brought the first bale of cotton into market at Memphis waspresented with a basket of champagne by the commission merchants. Thiswas a custom established throughout Mississippi. After the firstpickings were secured the cotton developed very fast, continuing to budand bloom all over the stalk until the frost falls. The season ofpicking was exciting to all planters, every one was zealous in pushinghis slaves in order that he might reap the greatest possible harvest.The planters talked about their prospects, discussed the cotton markets,just as the farmers of the north discuss the markets for theirproducts. I often saw Boss so excited and nervous during the season hescarcely ate. The daily task of each able-bodied slave during the cottonpicking season war 250 pounds or more, and all those who did not come upto the required amount would get a whipping. When the planter wantedmore cotton picked than usual, the overseer would arrange a race. Theslaves would be divided into two parties, with, a leader for each party.The first leader would choose a slave for his side, then the secondleader one for his, and so on alternately until all were chosen. Eachleader tried to get the best on his side. They would all work like goodfellows for the prize, which was a tin cup of sugar for each slave onthe winning side. The contest was kept up for three days whenever theplanter desired an extra amount picked. The slaves were just asinterested in the races as if they were going to get a five dollar bill.       *       *       *       *       *PREPARING COTTON FOR MARKET.The gin-house was situated about four hundred yards from "the greathouse" on the main road. It was a large shed built upon square timbers,and was similar to a barn, only it stood some six feet from the ground,and underneath was located the machinery for running the gin. The cottonwas put into the loft after it was dried, ready for ginning. In thisprocess the cotton was dropped from the loft to the man who fed themachine. As it was ginned the lint would go into the lint room, and theseed would drop at the feeder's feet. The baskets used for holding lintwere twice as large as those used in the picking process, and they werenever taken from the gin house. These lint baskets were used in removingthe lint from the lint room to the place where the cotton was baled. Abale contained 250 pounds, and the man who did the treading of thecotton into the bales would not vary ten pounds in the bale, soaccustomed was he to the packing. Generally from fourteen to fifteenbales of cotton were in the lint room at a time.       *       *       *       *       *OTHER FARM PRODUCTS.Cotton was the chief product of the Mississippi farms and nothing elsewas raised to sell. Wheat, oats and rye were raised in limitedquantities, but only for the slaves and the stock. All the fine flourfor the master's family was bought in St. Louis. Corn was raised inabundance, as it was a staple article of food for the slaves. It wasplanted about the 1st of March, or about a month earlier than thecotton. It was, therefore, up and partially worked before the cotton wasplanted and fully tilled before the cotton was ready for cultivation.Peas were planted between the rows of corn, and hundreds of bushels wereraised. These peas after being harvested, dried and beaten out of theshell, were of a reddish brown tint, not like those raised for themaster's family, but they were considered a wholesome and nutritiousfood for the slaves. Cabbage and yams, a large sweet potato, coarserthan the kind generally used by the whites and not so delicate inflavor, were also raised for the servants in liberal quantities. No haywas raised, but the leaves of the corn, stripped from the stalks whileyet green, cured and bound in bundles, were used as a substitute for itin feeding horses.       *       *       *       *       *FARM IMPLEMENTS.Almost all the implements used on the plantation were made by theslaves. Very few things were bought. Boss had a skilled blacksmith,uncle Ben, for whom he paid 1,800, and there were slaves who werecarpenters and workers in wood who could turn their hands to almostanything. Wagons, plows, harrows, grubbing hoes, hames, collars,baskets, bridle bits and hoe handles were all made on the farm and fromthe material which it produced, except the iron. The timber used inthese implements was generally white or red oak, and was cut andthoroughly seasoned long before it was needed. The articles thusmanufactured were not fine in form or finish, but they were durable, andanswered the purposes of a rude method of agriculture. Horse collarswere made from corn husks and from poplar bark which was stripped fromthe tree, in the spring, when the sap was up and it was soft andpliable, and separated into narrow strips which were plaited together.These collars were easy for the horse, and served the purpose of themore costly leather collar. Every season at least 200 cotton basketswere made. One man usually worked at this all the year round, but in thespring he had three assistants. The baskets were made from oak timber,grown in the home forests and prepared by the slaves. It was no smallpart of the work of the blacksmith and his assistant to keep the farmimplements in good repair, and much of this work was done at night. Allthe plank used was sawed by hand from timber grown on the master's land,as there were no saw mills in that region. Almost the only things notmade on the farm which were in general use there were axes, trace chainsand the hoes used in cultivating the cotton.       *       *       *       *       *THE CLEARING OF NEW LAND.When additional land was required for cultivation the first step was togo into the forest in summer and "deaden" or girdle the trees on a giventract. This was cutting through the bark all around the trunk aboutthirty inches from the ground. The trees so treated soon died and in ayear or two were in condition to be removed. The season selected forclearing the land was winter, beginning with January. The trees, exceptthe larger ones, were cut down, cut into lengths convenient for handlingand piled into great heaps, called "log heaps," and burned. Theundergrowth was grubbed out and also piled and burned. The burning wasdone at night and the sight was often weird and grand. The chopping wasdone by the men slaves and the grubbing by women. All the trees thatblew down during the summer were left as they fell till winter when theywere removed. This went on, year after year, until all the trees werecleared out. The first year after the new land was cleared corn was putin, the next season cotton. As a rule corn and cotton were plantedalternately, especially if the land was poor, if not, cotton would becontinued year after year on the same land. Old corn stalks were alwaysplowed under for the next year's crop and they served as an excellentfertilizer. Cotton was seldom planted on newly cleared land, as theroots and stumps rendered it difficult to cultivate the land withoutinjury to the growing plant.I never saw women put to the hard work of grubbing until I went toMcGee's and I greatly wondered at it. Such work was not done by womenslaves in Virginia. Children were required to do some work, it matterednot how many grown people were working. There were always tasks set forthe boys and girls ranging in age from nine to thirteen years, beyondthese ages they worked with the older slaves. After I had been inPontotoc two years I had to help plant and hoe, and work in the cottonduring the seasons, and soon learned to do everything pertaining to thefarm.       *       *       *       *       *COOKING FOR THE SLAVES.In summer time the cooking for the slaves was done out of doors. A largefire was built under a tree, two wooden forks were driven into theground on opposite sides of the fire, a pole laid on the forks and onthis kettles were hung over the fire for the preparation of the food.Cabbage and meat, boiled, alternated with meat and peas, were the staplefor summer. Bread was furnished with the meals and corn meal dumplings,that is, little balls made of meal and grease from the boiled bacon anddropped into boiling water, were also provided and considered quitepalatable, especially if cooked in the water in which the bacon wasboiled. In winter the cooking was done in a cabin, and sweet potatoes,dried peas and meat were the principal diet. This bill of fare was fordinner or the mid-day meal. For supper each slave received two pieces ofmeat and two slices of bread, but these slices were very large, as theloaves were about six inches thick and baked in an old fashioned oven.This bread was made from corn meal for, as I have said, only on holidaysand special occasions did the slaves have white bread of any kind. Partof the meat and bread received at supper time was saved for the "morningbite." The slaves never had any breakfast, but went to the field atdaylight and after working till the sun was well up, all would stop fortheir morning bite. Very often some young fellow ate his morning bitethe evening before at supper and would have nothing for the morning,going without eating until noon. The stop for morning bite was veryshort; then all would plunge into work until mid-day, when all handswere summoned to their principal meal.       *       *       *       *       *CARDING AND SPINNING.Through the winter and on rainy days in summer, the women of the fieldhad to card the wool and spin it into yarn. They generally worked inpairs, a spinning wheel and cards being assigned to each pair, and whileone carded the wool into rolls, the other spun it into yarn suitable forweaving into cloth, or a coarse, heavy thread used in making bridles andlines for the mules that were used in the fields. This work was done inthe cabins, and the women working together alternated in the carding andspinning. Four cuts were considered a task or day's work, and if any onefailed to complete her task she received a whipping from the madam. Atnight when the spinners brought their work to the big house I would haveit to reel. The reel was a contrivance consisting of a sort of wheel,turned on an axis, used to transfer the yarn from the spools orspindles of the spinning wheels into cuts or hunks. It was turned byhand and when enough yarn had been reeled to make a cut the reelsignaled it with a snap. This process was continued until four cuts werereeled which made a hunk, and this was taken off and was ready for use.So the work went on until all was reeled. I often got very weary of thiswork and would almost fall asleep at it, as it was generally done atnight after I had had a long day's toil at something else.       *       *       *       *       *WEAVING--CLOTHES OF THE SLAVES.One woman did the weaving and it was her task to weave from nine to tenyards a day. Aunt Liza was our weaver and she was taught the work by themadam. At first she did not get on so well with it and many times I haveseen the madam jump at her, pinch and choke her because she was dull inunderstanding how to do it. The madam made the unreasonable demand thatshe should do the full task at first, and because she failed she waspunished, as was the custom in all cases of failure, no matter howunreasonable the demand. Liza finally became equal to her task andaccomplished it each day. But the trouble and worry to me was when I hadto assist the madam in warping--getting the work ready for the weaver.She would warp the thread herself and place it in the loom, then I wouldhave to hand her the threads, as she put them through the hames. For anyfailure in quickly comprehending or doing my work, I did not fail toreceive the customary blow, or blows, from her hand.Each piece of cloth contained forty yards, and this cloth was used inmaking clothes for the servants. About half of the whole amount requiredwas thus made at home; the remainder was bought, and as it was heavierit was used for winter clothing. Each man was allowed for summer twopairs of pants and two shirts, but no coat. The women had two dressesand two chemises each for summer. For winter the men had each two pairsof pants, one coat, one hat and one pair of coarse shoes. These shoesbefore being worn had to be greased with tallow, with a little tar init. It was always a happy time when the men got these winter goods--itbrought many a smile to their faces, though the supply was meager andthe articles of the cheapest. The women's dresses for winter were madeof the heavier wool-cloth used for the men. They also had one pair ofshoes each and a turban. The women who could utilize old clothes, madefor themselves what were called pantalets. They had no stockings orundergarments to protect their limbs--these were never given them. Thepantalets were made like a pant-leg, came just above the knee, and werecaught and tied. Sometimes they looked well and comfortable. The men'sold pant-legs were sometimes used.I remember once when Boss went to Memphis and brought back a bolt ofgingham for turbans for the female slaves. It was a red and yellowcheck, and the turbans made from it were only to be worn on Sunday. Theold women were so glad that they sang and prayed. A little gift from themaster was greatly appreciated by them. I always came in for my shareeach year, but my clothes were somewhat different. I wore pants made ofBoss's old ones, and all his old coats were utilized for me. Theyrounded them off at the tail just a little and called them jackets. Myshoes were not brogans, but made of lighter leather, and made suitablefor in the house. I only worked on the farm in busy seasons, and did nothave the regular wear of the farm hands. On Monday morning it was agreat sight to see all the hands marching to the field. The cottonclothes worn by both men and women, and the turbans of the latter, weresnowy white, as were the wool hats of the men--all contrasted with thedark faces of the wearers in a strange and striking manner.       *       *       *       *       *SLAVE MOTHERS--CARE OF THE CHILDREN.The women who had young babies were assigned to what was considered"light work," such as hoeing potatoes, cutting weeds from the fencecorners, and any other work of like character. About nine o'clock in theforenoon, at noon, and three o'clock in the afternoon, these women,known on the farms as "the sucklers," could be seen going from work tonurse their babies. Many were the heart-sighs of these sorrowing mothersas they went to minister to their infants. Sometimes the little thingswould seem starved, for the mothers could only stop their toil threetimes a day to care for them. When old enough to receive it, the babieshad milk, the liquor from boiled cabbage, and bread and milk together. Awoman who was too old to do much of anything was assigned to the chargeof these babies in the absence of their mothers. It was rare that shehad any one to help her. The cries of these little ones, who were cutoff almost entirely from motherly care and protection, wereheart-rending.The cabin used for the infants during the day was a double one, that is,double the usual size, and was located near the great house. The cradlesused were made of boards, and were not more than two by three feet insize. The women carried their babies in the cradles to the baby cabin inthe morning, taking them to their own cabins at night. The childrenranging in age from one to seven years were numerous, and the old womanhad them to look after as well as the babies. This was indeed a task,and might well have taxed the strength of a younger woman. They werealways from eight to a dozen infants in the cabin. The summer season wastrying on the babies and young children. Often they would drink too muchliquor from cabbage, or too much buttermilk, and would be taken with asevere colic. I was always called on these occasions to go with Boss toadminister medicine. I remember on one occasion a little boy had eatentoo much cabbage, and was taken with cramp colic. In a few minutes hisstomach was swollen as tight and hard as a balloon, and his teethclenched. He was given an emetic, put in a mustard bath and was soonrelieved. The food was too heavy for these children, and they werenearly always in need of some medical attendance. Excessive heat, withimproper food, often brought on cholera infantum, from which the infantssometimes died rapidly and in considerable numbers.       *       *       *       *       *METHODS OF PUNISHMENT.The methods of punishment were barbarous in the extreme, and so numerousthat I will not attempt to describe them all. One method was to tie theslave to a tree, strip off his clothes, and then whip him with arawhide, or long, limber switches, or the terrible bull whip. Anotherwas to put the slave in stocks, or to buck him, that is, fasten his feettogether, draw up his knees to his chin, tie his hands together, drawthem down over the knees, and put a stick under the latter and over thearms. In either of these ways the slave was entirely at the mercy of histormentors, and the whipping could proceed at their pleasure. Afterthese whippings the slave was often left helpless and bleeding upon theground, until the master, or overseer, saw fit to let him up. The mostcommon method of punishment was to have the servants form a ring, calledthe "bull ring," into which the one to be punished was led naked. Theslaves were then each given a switch, rawhide, strap or whip, and eachone was compelled to cut at the poor victim as he ran around the ring.The ring was composed of men, women and children; and, as they numberedfrom forty to fifty, each circuit of the ring would result in thatnumber of lashes, and by the time the victim had made two or threerounds his condition can be readily imagined. The overseer was alwaysone of the ring, vigorously using the whip, and seeing that all theslaves did the same. Some of the victims fainted before they had passedonce around the ring. Women slaves were punished in the same manner asthe men. The salt water bath was given after each punishment. Runawayslaves were usually caught by means of hounds, trained for the purposeby men who made it a business and a source of revenue, notwithstandingits brutal features and degrading influence.       *       *       *       *       *FOURTH OF JULY BARBECUE.Barbecue originally meant to dress and roast a hog whole, but has cometo mean the cooking of a food animal in this manner for the feeding of agreat company. A feast of this kind was always given to us, by Boss, onthe 4th of July. The anticipation of it acted as a stimulant throughthe entire year. Each one looked forward to this great day of recreationwith pleasure. Even the older slaves would join in the discussion of thecoming event. It mattered not what trouble or hardship the year hadbrought, this feast and its attendant pleasure would dissipate allgloom. Some, probably, would be punished on the morning of the 4th, butthis did not matter; the men thought of the good things in store forthem, and that made them forget that they had been punished. All theweek previous to the great day, the slaves were in high spirits, theyoung girls and boys, each evening, congregating, in front of thecabins, to talk of the feast, while others would sing and dance. Theolder slaves were not less happy, but would only say; "Ah! God hasblessed us in permitting us to see another feast day." The day beforethe 4th was a busy one. The slaves worked with all their might. Thechildren who were large enough were engaged in bringing wood and bark tothe spot where the barbecue was to take place. They worked eagerly, allday long; and, by the time the sun was setting, a huge pile of fuel wasbeside the trench, ready for use in the morning. At an early hour of thegreat day, the servants were up, and the men whom Boss had appointed tolook after the killing of the hogs and sheep were quickly at their work,and, by the time they had the meat dressed and ready, most of the slaveshad arrived at the center of attraction. They gathered in groups,talking, laughing, telling tales that they had from their grandfather,or relating practical jokes that they had played or seen played byothers. These tales were received with peals of laughter. But howevermuch they seemed to enjoy these stories and social interchanges, theynever lost sight of the trench or the spot where the sweetmeats were tobe cooked.The method of cooking the meat was to dig a trench in the ground aboutsix feet long and eighteen inches deep. This trench was filled with woodand bark which was set on fire, and, when it was burned to a great bedof coals, the hog was split through the back bone, and laid on poleswhich had been placed across the trench. The sheep were treated in thesame way, and both were turned from side to side as they cooked. Duringthe process of roasting the cooks basted the carcasses with apreparation furnished from the great house, consisting of butter,pepper, salt and vinegar, and this was continued until the meat wasready to serve. Not far from this trench were the iron ovens, where thesweetmeats were cooked. Three or four women were assigned to this work.Peach cobbler and apple dumpling were the two dishes that made oldslaves smile for joy and the young fairly dance. The crust or pastry ofthe cobbler was prepared in large earthen bowls, then rolled out likeany pie crust, only it was almost twice as thick. A layer of this crustwas laid in the oven, then a half peck of peaches poured, in, followedby a layer of sugar; then a covering of pastry was laid over all andsmoothed around with a knife. The oven was then put over a bed of coals,the cover put on and coals thrown on it, and the process of bakingbegan. Four of these ovens were usually in use at these feasts, so thatenough of the pastry might be baked to supply all. The ovens were filledand refilled until there was no doubt about the quantity. The appledumplings were made in the usual way, only larger, and served with saucemade from brown sugar. It lacked flavoring, such as cinnamon or lemon,yet it was a dish highly relished by all the slaves. I know that thesefeasts made me so excited, I could scarcely do my house duties, and Iwould never fail to stop and look out of the window from the dining roomdown into the quarters. I was eager to get through with my work and bewith the feasters. About noon everything was ready to serve. The tablewas set in a grove near the quarters, a place set aside for theseoccasions. The tableware was not fine, being of tin, but it served thepurpose, and did not detract from the slaves' relish for the feast. Thedrinks were strictly temperance drinks--buttermilk and water. Some ofthe nicest portions of the meat were sliced off and put on a platter tosend to the great house for Boss and his family. It was a pleasure forthe slaves to do this, for Boss always enjoyed it. It was said that theslaves could barbecue meats best, and when the whites had barbecuesslaves always did the cooking. When dinner was all on the table, theinvitation was given for all to come; and when all were in a good wayeating, Boss and the madam would go out to witness the progress of thefeast, and seemed pleased to see the servants so happy. Everything wasin abundance, so all could have plenty--Boss always insisted on this.The slaves had the whole day off, and could do as they liked. Afterdinner some of the women would wash, sew or iron. It was a day ofharmless riot for all the slaves, and I can not express the happiness itbrought them. Old and young, for months, would rejoice in the memory ofthe day and its festivities, and "bless" Boss for this ray of sunlightin their darkened lives.       *       *       *       *       *ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH.There was an observance of religious forms at least by the occupants ofboth the great house and the cabins. The McGee family were church-goingpeople, and, except in very inclement weather, never failed to attendservice on Sunday. They were Methodists, and their church was four milesfrom their residence. The Baptist church was but two miles distant, andthe family usually alternated in their attendance between the two placesof worship. I always attended them to church, generally riding behindwhile the Boss drove. Upon reaching church, my first duty was to run toa spring for a pitcher of fresh water, which I passed not only to themembers of our party, but to any others desiring drink. Whatever may bethought of the religious professions of the slave-holders, there can beno question that many of the slaves were sincere believers in theChristian religion, and endeavored to obey the precepts according totheir light.       *       *       *       *       *RELIGIOUS MEETINGS OF THE SLAVES.Saturday evening on the farm was always hailed with delight. The air wasfilled with happy shouts from men and boys, so glad were they thatSunday, their only day of rest, was near. In the cabins the women werewashing and fixing garments for Sunday, that they might honor the Lordin cleanliness and decency. It was astonishing how they utilized whatthey had, and with what skill and industry they performed theseself-imposed tasks. Where the family was large it was often aftermidnight before this work was done. While this preparation for theSabbath was in progress in most of the cabins, the old men would gatherin one for a prayer-meeting. As they began to sing some familiar hymn,the air would ring with their voices, and it was not long before thecabin was filled with both old and young, who came in their simple yetsincere way to give praise to God. It was common to have one or twoexhorters on the plantation who claimed to be called to do service forGod, by teaching their fellow men the principles of religion. Godcertainly must have revealed himself to these poor souls, for they werevery ignorant--they did not know a letter of the Bible. But when theyopened their mouths they were filled, and the plan of Salvation wasexplained in a way that all could receive it. It was always a mystery tothe white brethren how the slaves could line out hymns, preach Christand redemption, yet have no knowledge even of how the name of Christ wasspelled. They were illiterate to the last degree, so there is but onetheory, they were inspired. God revealed unto them just what they shouldteach their flock, the same as he did to Moses. I remember very wellthat there was always a solemnity about the services--a certain harmony,which had a peculiar effect--a certain pathetic tone which quickened theemotions as they sang those old plantation hymns. It mattered not whattheir troubles had been during the week--how much they had been lashed,the prayer-meeting on Saturday evening never failed to be held. Theirfaith was tried and true. On Sunday afternoons, they would allcongregate again to praise God, and the congregation was enthusiastic.It was pathetic to hear them pray, from the depths of their hearts, forthem who "despitefully used them and persecuted them." This injunctionof our Saviour was strictly adhered to. The words that came from theminister were always of a consolatory kind. He knew the crosses of hisfellow slaves and their hardships, for he had shared them himself. I wasalways touched in hearing him give out the hymns. I can hear old UncleBen now, as he solemnly worded out the following lines:     Must I be carried to the skies,       On flowery beds of ease,     While others fought to win the prize,       And sailed through bloody seas?After singing he would always speak to them of the necessity forpatience in bearing the crosses, urging them to endure "as goodsoldiers." Many tears were shed, and many glad shouts of praise wouldburst forth during the sermon. A hymn usually followed the sermon, thenall retired. Their faces seemed to shine with a happy light--their verycountenance showed that their souls had been refreshed and that it hadbeen "good for them to be there." These meetings were the joy andcomfort of the slaves, and even those who did not profess Christianitywere calm and thoughtful while in attendance.       *       *       *       *       *A NEIGHBORHOOD QUARRELOpposite our farm was one owned by a Mr. Juval, and adjoining that wasanother belonging to one White. The McGees and the Whites were very fastfriends, visiting each other regularly--indeed they had grown uptogether, and Mr. White at one time was the lover of the madam, andengaged to be married to her. This friendship had existed for years,when McGee bought the Juval farm, for which White had also beennegotiating, but which he failed to get on account of McGee havingout-bid him. From this circumstance ill feeling was engendered betweenthe two men, and they soon became bitter enemies. McGee had decided tobuild a fence between the farm he had purchased and that of White, and,during the winter, his teamsters were set to hauling the rails; and, inunloading them, they accidentally threw some of them over the line on toWhite's land. The latter said nothing about the matter until spring,when he wrote McGee a letter, asking him to remove the rails from hisland. McGee paid no attention to the request, and he soon received asecond note, when he said to his wife: "That fellow is about to turnhimself a fool--I'll give him a cow-hiding." A third and more emphaticnote followed, in which White told the Boss that the rails must beremoved within twenty-four hours. He grew indignant, and, in trueSouthern style, he went immediately to town and bought arms, andprepared himself for the fray. When he returned he had every hand on theplantation stop regular work, and put them all to building the fence. Iwas of the number. Boss and the overseer came out to overlook the workand hurry it on. About four o'clock in the afternoon White put in anappearance, and came face to face with McGee, sitting on his horse andhaving a double barreled shot gun lying across the pummel of his saddle.White passed on without saying a word, but Boss yelled at him; "Hello! Isee you are about to turn yourself a d--d fool." White checked up andbegan to swear, saying: "You are a coward to attack an unarmed man." Hegrew furious, took off his hat, ran his fingers through his hair,saying: "Here I am, blow me to h--l, and I'll have some one blow youthere before night." During White's rage he said: "I'll fight youanywhere--bowie-knife fight, shot gun fight or any other." He called, inhis excitement, for his nephew, who was working on his farm, to come,and immediately sent him to Billy Duncan's to get him a double barreledshot gun. Meantime, Mrs. McGee appeared on the scene, and began to cry,begging White to stop and allow her to speak to him. But he replied: "Gooff, go off, I don't want to speak to you." Boss grew weak and sick, andthrough his excitement, was taken violently ill, vomiting as if he hadtaken an emetic. He said to White; "I'll return as soon as I take mywife home," but he never came back. As Boss and the madam rode off,White came galloping back, and said to Brooks, our overseer: "If I amshot down on foul play would you speak of it?" Brooks replied: "No, Idon't care to interfere--I don't wish to have anything to do with it."White was bloodthirsty, and came back at intervals during the entirenight, where we were working, to see if he could find Boss. It is quiteprobable that White may have long cherished a secret grudge againstBoss, because he had robbed him of his first love; and, brooding overthese offenses, he became so excited as to be almost insane. Had McGeereturned that night, White would certainly have shot him. Boss became souneasy over the situation that he sent one of his slaves, a foreman, toPanola county, some seventy-five miles distant, to Mrs. McGee's father,to get her brother, a lawyer, to come and endeavor to effect asettlement. He came, but all his efforts were unavailing. The men met ata magistrate's office, but they came to no understanding. Our folksbecame dissatisfied, and did not care to remain longer in the place, sothey began to look out for other quarters. Boss finally decided to buy afarm in Bolivar, Miss., and to remove his family to Memphis, where hesecured a fine place, just outside of the city.[Illustration: Farmer's Merchants Bank--Three Dollar Banknote]CHAPTER II.SOCIAL AND OTHER ASPECTS OF SLAVERY.       *       *       *       *       *REMOVAL TO MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.McGee had decided to build a new house upon the property which he hadpurchased at Memphis; and, in August 1850, he sent twenty-five of hisslaves to the city, to make brick for the structure, and I went along ascook. After the bricks were burned, the work of clearing the ground forthe buildings was commenced. There were many large and beautiful treesthat had to be taken up and removed; and, when this work was completed,the excavations for the foundations and the cellar were undertaken. Allof this work was done by the slaves. The site was a beautiful one,embracing fourteen acres, situated two miles southeast from the city, onthe Memphis and Charleston railroad. The road ran in front of the placeand the Boss built a flag-station there, for the accommodation ofhimself and his neighbors, which was named McGee Station.       *       *       *       *       *A NEW AND SPLENDID HOUSE.The house was one of the most pretentious in that region, and was a yearand a half in building. It was two stories in height, and built ofbrick, the exterior surface being coated with cement and marked off inblocks, about two feet square, to represent stone. It was thenwhitewashed. There was a veranda in front with six large columns, and,above, a balcony. On the back there were also a veranda and a balcony,extending across that end to the servants' wing. A large hall led fromfront to rear, on one side of which were double parlors, and on theother a sitting room, a bedroom and a dining room. In the second storywere a hall and four rooms, similar in all respects to those below, andabove these was a large attic. The interior woodwork was of blackwalnut. The walls were white, and the centerpieces in the ceilings ofall the rooms were very fine, being the work of an English artisan, whohad been only a short time in this country. This work was so superior,in design and finish, to anything before seen in that region that localartisans were much excited over it; and some offered to purchase theright to reproduce it, but Boss refused the offer. However, some one,while the house was finishing, helped himself to the design, and it wasreproduced, in whole or in part, in other buildings in the city. Thisemployment of a foreign artist was unusual there and caused muchcomment. The parlors were furnished with mahogany sets, the upholsteringbeing in red brocade satin. The dining room was also furnished inmahogany. The bedrooms had mahogany bedsteads of the old-fashionedpattern with canopies. Costly bric-a-brac, which Boss and the madam hadpurchased while traveling in foreign countries, was in great profusion.Money was no object to Edmund McGee, and he added every modernimprovement and luxury to his home; the decorations and furnishings werethroughout of the most costly and elegant; and in the whole of Tennesseethere was not a mansion more sumptuously complete in all itsappointments, or more palatial in its general appearance. When all wasfinished--pictures, bric-a-brac, statuary and flowers all in theirplaces, Mrs. McGee was brought home.In this new house Boss opened up in grand style; everything was changed,and the family entered upon a new, more formal and more pretentiousmanner of living. I was known no longer as errand boy, but installed asbutler and body-servant to my master. I had the same routine of morningwork, only it was more extensive. There was a great deal to be done inso spacious a mansion. Looking after the parlors, halls and diningrooms, arranging flowers in the rooms, waiting on the table, and goingafter the mail was my regular morning work, the year round. Then therewere my duties to perform, night and morning, for my master; these wereto brush his clothes, black his shoes, assist him to arrange his toilet,and do any little thing that he wanted me to. Aside from these regularduties, there were windows to wash, silver to polish and steps to stoneon certain days in the week. I was called to do any errand necessary,and sometimes to assist in the garden. A new staff of house servants wasinstalled, as follows: Aunt Delia, cook; Louisa, chambermaid; Puss,lady's maid to wait on the madam; Celia, nurse; Lethia, wet nurse;Sarah, dairymaid; Julia, laundress; Uncle Gooden, gardener; Thomas,coachman.       *       *       *       *       *THE NEW STYLE OF LIVING.The servants, at first, were dazed with the splendor of the new house,and laughed and chuckled to themselves a good deal about mars' finehouse, and really seemed pleased; for, strange to say, the slaves ofrich people always rejoiced in that fact. A servant owned by a man inmoderate circumstances was hooted at by rich men's slaves. It was commonfor them to say: "Oh! don't mind that darkey, he belongs to po'r whitetrash." So, as I said, our slaves rejoiced in master's good luck. Eachof the women servants wore a new, gay colored turban, which was tieddifferently from that of the ordinary servant, in some fancy knot. Theirfrocks and aprons were new, and really the servants themselves lookednew. My outfit was a new cloth suit, and my aprons for wearing whenwaiting on the table were of snowy white linen, the style being copiedfrom that of the New York waiters. I felt big, for I never knew what awhite bosom shirt was before; and even though the grief at theseparation from my dear mother was almost unbearable at times, and mysense of loneliness in having no relative near me often made me sad,there was consolation, if not compensation, in this little change. I hadknown no comforts, and had been so cowed and broken in spirits, by cruellashings, that I really felt light-hearted at this improvement in mypersonal appearance, although it was merely for the gratification of mymaster's pride; and I thought I would do all I could to please Boss.       *       *       *       *       *THE ADORNMENT OF THE GROUNDS.For some time before all the appointments of the new home werecompleted, a great number of mechanics and workmen, besides our ownservants, were employed; and there was much bustle and stir about thepremises. Considerable out-door work was yet to be done--fences to bemade, gardens and orchards to be arranged and planted, and the groundsabout the house to be laid out and adorned with shrubbery and flowerbeds. When this work was finally accomplished, the grounds were indeedbeautiful. The walks were graveled, and led through a profusion ofshrubbery and flower beds. There was almost every variety of roses;while, scattered over the grounds, there were spruce, pine and junipertrees, and some rare varieties, seldom seen in this northern climate.Around the grounds was set a cedar hedge, and, in time, the place becamenoted for the beauty of its shrubbery; the roses especially weremarvelous in the richness and variety of their colors, their fragranceand the luxuriousness of their growth. People who have never traveledin the South have little idea of the richness and profusion of itsflowers, especially of its roses. Among the climbing plants, whichadorned the house, the most beautiful and fragrant was the Africanhoneysuckle--its odor was indeed delightful.       *       *       *       *       *THE GARDEN.One of the institutions of the place was the vegetable garden. This wasestablished not only for the convenience and comfort of the family, butto furnish employment for the slaves. Under the care of Uncle Gooden,the gardener, it flourished greatly; and there was so much more producedthan the family could use, Boss concluded to sell the surplus. Thegardener, therefore, went to the city, every morning, with a load ofvegetables, which brought from eight to ten dollars daily, and this themadam took for "pin money." In the spring I had always to help thegardener in setting out plants and preparing beds; and, as this was inconnection with my other work, I became so tired sometimes that I couldhardly stand. All the vegetables raised were fine, and at that timebrought a good price. The first cabbage that we sold in the marketsbrought twenty-five cents a head. The first sweet potatoes marketedalways brought a dollar a peck, or four dollars a bushel. The Memphismarket regulations required that all vegetables be washed before beingexposed for sale. Corn was husked, and everything was clean andinviting. Any one found guilty of selling, or exhibiting for sale,vegetables of a previous day was fined, at once, by the market master.This rule was carried out to the letter. Nothing stale could be sold, oreven come into market. The rules required that all poultry be dressedbefore being brought to market. The entrails were cleaned and strung andsold separately--usually for about ten cents a string.       *       *       *       *       *PROFUSION OF FLOWERS.Flowers grew in profusion everywhere through the south, and it has,properly, been called the land of flowers. But flowers had no such salethere as have our flowers here in the north. The pansy and many of ourhighly prized plants and flowers grew wild in the south. The peoplethere did not seem to care for flowers as we do. I have sold manybouquets for a dime, and very beautiful ones for fifteen and twentycents, that would sell in the north for fifty to seventy-five cents.       *       *       *       *       *THE FRUIT ORCHARD.The new place had an orchard of about four acres, consisting of avariety of apple, peach, pear and plum trees. Boss hired an expertgardener to teach me the art of grafting, and, after some practice, Ibecame quite skilled in this work. Some of the pear trees that had beengrafted had three different kinds of fruit on them, and others had threekinds of apples on them besides the pears. This grafting I did myself,and the trees were considered very fine by Boss. Another part of my workwas the trimming of the hedge and the care of all the shrubbery.       *       *       *       *       *I PRACTICE MEDICINE AMONG THE SLAVES.McGee had a medicine chest built into the wall of the new house. Theshelves for medicine were of wood, and the arrangement was veryconvenient. It was really a small drug store. It contained everything inthe way of drugs that was necessary to use in doctoring the slaves. Wehad quinine, castor-oil, alcohol and ipecac in great quantities, asthese were the principal drugs used in the limited practice in the homeestablishment. If a servant came from the field to the house with achill, which was frequent, the first thing we did was to give him a doseof ipecac to vomit him. On the evening after, we would give him two orthree of Cook's pills. These pills we made at home, I always had toprepare the medicines, and give the dose, the Boss standing bydictating. Working with medicine, giving it and caring for the sick werethe parts of my work that I liked best. Boss used Dr. Gunn's bookaltogether for recipes in putting up medicines. He read me the recipe,while I compounded it.       *       *       *       *       *A SWELL RECEPTION.In celebration of the opening of the new house, McGee gave an elaboratereception and dinner. The menu embraced nearly everything that one couldthink of or desire, and all in the greatest profusion. It was a custom,not only with the McGees but among the southern people generally, tomake much of eating--it was one of their hobbies. Everything was cookedwell, and highly seasoned. Scarcity was foreign to the homes of thewealthy southerners.       *       *       *       *       *RELATIVES VISIT AT THE MANSION.After the family had been settled about a month in the new home, theirrelatives in Panola Co., Miss., Mr. Jack McGee, known among the servantsas "Old Jack," Mrs. Melinda McGee, his wife, Mrs. Farrington, theirdaughter who was a widow, and their other children Louisa, Ella andWilliam, all came up for a visit, and to see the wonderful house. Mr.Jack McGee was the father of madam and the uncle of Boss. My master andmistress were therefore first cousins, and Boss sometimes called the oldman father and at other times, uncle. Old Master Jack, as he alighted,said to those behind him: "Now be careful, step lightly, Louisa, this isthe finest house you ever set foot in." When all had come into thehouse, and the old man had begun to look around, he said: "I don't knowwhat Edmund is thinking about-out to build such a house-house." He wasvery old, and had never lost all of his Scotch dialect, and he had ahabit of repeating a part or all of some words, as in the foregoingquotation. The other members of the visiting family were well pleasedwith the house, and said it was grand. They laughed and talked merrilyover the many novel things which they saw. Mrs. Farrington, who was agay widow, was naturally interested in everything. I busied myselfwaiting upon them, and it was late that night before I was through. Somany made extra work for me.       *       *       *       *       *ONE OF THE VISITORS DISTRUSTS ME.The next morning, after breakfast, Boss and old Master Jack went out toview the grounds. They took me along so that if anything was wanted Icould do it. Boss would have me drive a stake in some place to markwhere he desired to put something, perhaps some flowers, or a tree. Hewent on through the grounds, showing his father how everything was to bearranged. The old man shook his head, and said: "Well, it's good, but Iam afraid you'll spoil these niggers-niggers. Keep you eye on that boyLou, (meaning me) he is slippery-slippery, too smart-art." "Oh! I'llmanage that, Father," said Boss. "Well, see that you do-oo, for I seerunning away in his eyes." One of the things that interested old MasterJack was the ringing of the dinner bell. "Well, I do think," said theold man, "that boy can ring a bell better than anybody I ever heard. Why,its got a regular tune." I used to try to see how near I could come tomaking it say, come to dinner.       *       *       *       *       *THE MADAM IN A RAGE.The four days soon passed, and all the company gone, we were once moreat our regular work. Delia, the cook, seemingly had not pleased themadam in her cooking while the company were there; so, the morningafter they left, she went toward the kitchen, calling: "Delia, Delia."Delia said: "Dah! I wonder what she wants now." By this time she was inthe kitchen, confronting Delia. Her face was flushed as she screamedout: "What kind of biscuits were those you baked this week?" "I thinkthey were all right, Mis Sarh." "Hush!" screamed out the madam, stampingher foot to make it more emphatic. "You did not half cook them," saidshe; "they were not beat enough. Those waffles were ridiculous," saidthe madam. "Well, Mis Sarh, I tried." "Stop!" cried Madam in a rage,"I'll give you thunder if you dictate to me." Not a very elegant displayin language or manner for a great lady! Old Aunt Delia, who was used tothese occurrences, said: "My Lord! dat woman dunno what she wants. Ah!Lou, there is nothing but the devil up here, (meaning the new home);can't do nothin to please her up here in dis fine house. I tell youSatan neber git his own til he git her." They did not use baking powder,as we do now, but the biscuits were beaten until light enough. Twentyminutes was the time allotted for this work; but when company came therewas so much to be done--so many more dishes to prepare, that Deliawould, perhaps, not have so much time for each meal. But there was noallowance made. It was never thought reasonable that a servant shouldmake a mistake--things must always be the same. I was listening to thisquarrel between madam and Delia, supposing my time would come next; butfor that once she said nothing to me.       *       *       *       *       *THE MADAM'S SEVERITY.Mrs. McGee was naturally irritable. Servants always got an extrawhipping when she had any personal trouble, as though they could helpit. Every morning little Kate, Aunt Delia's little girl, would have togo with the madam on her rounds to the different buildings of theestablishment, to carry the key basket. So many were the keys that theywere kept in a basket especially provided for them, and the child wasits regular bearer. The madam, with this little attendant, waseverywhere--in the barn, in the hennery, in the smokehouse--and shealways made trouble with the servants wherever she went. Indeed, sherarely returned to the house from these rounds without having whippedtwo or three servants, whether there was really any cause for thepunishment or not. She seldom let a day pass without beating some poorwoman unmercifully. The number and severity of these whippings dependedmore upon the humor of the madam than upon the conduct of the slaves. Ofcourse, I always came in for a share in this brutal treatment. Shecontinued her old habit of boxing my jaws, pinching my ears: no day everpassing without her indulging in this exercise of her physical powers.So long had I endured this, I came to expect it, no matter how well Idid my duties; and it had its natural effect upon me, making me acoward, even though I was now growing into manhood. I remember once, inparticular, when I had tried to please her by arranging the parlor, Ioverheard her say: "They soon get spirit--it don't do to praiseservants." My heart sank within me. What good was it for me to try toplease? She would find fault anyway. Her usual morning greeting was:"Well, Lou, have you dusted the parlors?" "Oh, yes," I would answer."Have the flowers been arranged?" "Yes, all is in readiness," I wouldsay. Once I had stoned the steps as usual, but the madam grew angry assoon as she saw them. I had labored hard, and thought she would bepleased. The result, however, was very far from that. She took me out,stripped me of my shirt and began thrashing me, saying I was spoiled. Iwas no longer a child, but old enough to be treated differently. I beganto cry, for it seemed to me my heart would break. But, after the firstburst of tears, the feeling came over me that I was a man, and it was anoutrage to treat me so--to keep me under the lash day after day.       *       *       *       *       *A SHOCKING ACCIDENT.Not long after Mrs. Farrington had made her first visit to our house,she came there to live. Celia had been acting as her maid. When Mrs.Farrington had been up some months, it was decided that all the familyshould go down to old Master Jack's for a visit. Celia, the maid, hadbeen so hurried in the preparations for this visit that she had donenothing for herself. The night before the family was to leave,therefore, she was getting ready a garment for herself to wear on thetrip; and it was supposed that she sewed until midnight, or after, whenshe fell asleep, letting the goods fall into the candle. All at once, alittle after twelve o'clock, I heard a scream, then a cry of "fire!fire!" and Boss yelling: "Louis! Louis!" I jumped up, throwing an oldcoat over me, and ran up stairs, in the direction of Mrs. Farrington'sroom, I encountered Boss in the hall; and, as it was dark and the smokestifling, I could hardly make any headway. At this moment Mrs.Farrington threw her door open, and screamed for "Cousin Eddie," meaningMcGee. He hurriedly called to me to get a pitcher of water quick. Igrasped the pitcher from the stand, and he attempted to throw the wateron Celia, who was all in a blaze, running around like a mad woman; butthe pitcher slipped from his hand and broke, very little of the waterreaching her. She was at last wrapped in an old blanket, to extinguishthe flames; but she was burned too badly to recover. Boss, being aphysician, said at once: "Poor girl, poor girl! she is burned to death."He did all he could for her, wrapped her in linen sheets, and endeavoredto relieve her sufferings, but all was of no avail--she had inhaled theflame, injuring her internally, and lived only a few days.       *       *       *       *       *MASTER'S NEW COTTON PLANTATION.Shortly after Boss bought his home in Memphis, he bought a large farm inBolivar, Miss. It was a regular cotton farm, on the Mississippi river,embracing 200 acres. The houses built for the slaves were frame,eighteen in number, each to contain three or four families, and arrangedon each side of a street that ran through the farm. This street was allgrassed over, but there were no sidewalks. All the buildings--the barn,gin-house, slaves' quarters and overseers' house--were whitewashed, andon this grass-grown street they made a neat and pretty appearance. Thehouse where the Boss and the madam staid, when they went down to thefarm, was about two hundred yards from the slaves' quarters. It wasarranged in two apartments, one for the overseer and wife, and the otherfor the master and mistress upon the occasion of their visits. Thisbuilding was separated from the other buildings by a fence. There waswhat was called the cook house, where was cooked all the food for thehands. Aunt Matilda was cook in charge. Besides the buildings alreadynamed, there were stables, a blacksmith shop and sawmill; and thegeneral order of arrangement was carried out with respect to all--theappearance was that of a village. Everything was raised in abundance, tolast from one crop to the next. Vegetables and meat were provided fromthe farm, and a dairy of fifty cows furnished all the milk and butterneeded.The cane brakes were so heavy that it was common for bears to hidethere, and, at night, come out and carry off hogs. Wolves were plenty inthe woods behind the farm, and could be heard at any time. The cane wasso thick that when they were clearing up new ground, it would have to beset on fire, and the cracking that would ensue was like the continuousexplosion of small fire crackers.About one hundred and sixty slaves, besides children, all owned byMcGee, were worked on the farm. Instead of ginning two or three bales ofcotton a day, as at Pontotoc, they ginned six to seven bales here.       *       *       *       *       *INCIDENTS.I remember well the time when the great Swedish singer, Jenny Lind, cameto Memphis. It was during her famous tour through America, in 1851. Ourfolks were all enthused over her. Boss went in and secured tickets toher concert, and I was summoned to drive them to the hall. It was agreat event. People swarmed the streets like bees. The carriages andhacks were stacked back from the hall as far as the eye could reach.On another occasion, when the great prodigy, Blind Tom, came toMemphis, there was a similar stir among the people. Tom was very youngthen, and he was called the Blind Boy. People came from far and near tohear him. Those coming from the villages and small towns, who could notget passage on the regular trains, came in freight or on flat bottomcars. The tickets were 5.00 each, as I remember, Boss said it wasexpensive, but all must hear this boy pianist. Many were the comments onthis boy of such wonderful talents. As I drove our people home theyseemed to talk of nothing else. They declared that he was indeed awonder.       *       *       *       *       *LONGING FOR FREEDOM.Sometimes when the farm hands were at work, peddlers would come along;and, as they were treated badly by the rich planters, they hated them,and talked to the slaves in a way to excite them and set them thinkingof freedom. They would say encouragingly to them: "Ah! You will be freesome day." But the down-trodden slaves, some of whom were bowed withage, with frosted hair and furrowed cheek, would answer, looking up fromtheir work: "We don't blieve dat; my grandfather said we was to be free,but we aint free yet." It had been talked of (this freedom) fromgeneration to generation. Perhaps they would not have thought offreedom, if their owners had not been so cruel. Had my mistress beenmore kind to me, I should have thought less of liberty. I know the crueltreatment which I received was the main thing that made me wish to befree. Besides this, it was inhuman to separate families as they did.Think of a mother being sold from all her children--separated for life!This separation was common, and many died heart-broken, by reason of it.Ah! I cannot forget the cruel separation from my mother. I know not whatbecame of her, but I have always believed her dead many years ago.Hundreds were separated, as my mother and I were, and never met again.Though freedom was yearned for by some because the treatment was so bad,others, who were bright and had looked into the matter, knew it was acurse to be held a slave--they longed to stand out in truemanhood--allowed to express their opinions as were white men. Othersstill desired freedom, thinking they could then reclaim a wife, orhusband, or children. The mother would again see her child. All thesepromptings of the heart made them yearn for freedom. New Year's wasalways a heart-rending time, for it was then the slaves were bought andsold; and they stood in constant fear of losing some one dear to them--achild, a husband, or wife.       *       *       *       *       *MY FIRST BREAK FOR FREEDOM.In the new home my duties were harder than ever. The McGees held me withtighter grip, and it was nothing but cruel abuse, from morning tillnight. So I made up my mind to try and run away to a free country. Iused to hear Boss read sometimes, in the papers, about runaway slaveswho had gone to Canada, and it always made me long to go; yet I neverappeared as if I paid the slightest attention to what the family read orsaid on such matters; but I felt that I could be like others, and try atleast to get away. One morning, when Boss had gone to town, Madam hadthreatened to whip me, and told me to come to the house. When she calledme I did not go, but went off down through the garden and through thewoods, and made my way for the city. When I got into Memphis, I found atthe landing a boat called the Statesman, and I sneaked aboard. It wasnot expected that the boat would stay more than a few hours, but, forsome reason, it stayed all night. The boat was loaded with sugar, and Ihid myself behind four hogsheads. I could see both engineers, one eachside of me. When night came on, I crept out from my hiding place, andwent forward to search for food and water, for I was thirsty and veryhungry. I found the table where the deck hands had been eating, andmanaged to get a little food, left from their meal, and some water. Thiswas by no means enough, but I had to be content, and went back to myplace of concealment. I had been on board the boat three days; and, onthe third night, when I came out to hunt food, the second mate saw me.In a minute he eyed me over and said: "Why, I have a reward for you." Ina second he had me go up stairs to the captain. This raised a greatexcitement among the passengers; and, in a minute, I was besieged withnumerous questions. Some spoke as if they were sorry for me, and said ifthey had known I was a poor runaway slave they would have slipped meashore. The whole boat was in alarm. It seemed to me they wereconsulting slips of paper. One said: "Yes, he is the same. Listen howthis reads:""Ran away from Edmund McGee, my mulatto boy Louis, 5 feet 6 inches inheight, black hair, is very bright and intelligent. Will give 500 forhim alive, and half of this amount for knowledge that he has beenkilled."My heart sprang into my throat when I heard two men read thisadvertisement. I knew, at once, what it all meant, remembering how oftenI had heard Boss read such articles from the papers and from thehandbills that were distributed through the city. The captain asked meif I could dance. It seemed he felt sorry for me, for he said: "That's abright boy to be a slave." Then turning to me he said: "Come, give us adance." I was young and nimble, so I danced a few of the old southernclog dances, and sang one or two songs, like this:    "Come along, Sam, the fifer's son,    Aint you mighty glad your day's work's done?"After I finished singing and dancing, the captain took up a collectionfor me and got about two dollars. This cheered me a good deal. I knewthat I would need money if I should ever succeed in getting on.On the following evening, when we reached West Franklin, Indiana, whilethe passengers were at tea, another boat pushed into port right afterours. Immediately a gentleman passenger came to me hurriedly, andwhispered to me to go down stairs, jump out on the bow of the otherboat, and go ashore. I was alarmed, but obeyed, for I felt that he was afriend to slaves. I went out as quietly as I could, and was not misseduntil I had gotten on shore. Then I heard the alarm given that the boywas gone--that the runaway was gone. But I sped on, and did not stopuntil I had run through the village, and had come to a road that ledright into the country. I took this road and went on until I had gonefour or five miles, when I came to a farm house. Before reaching it,however, I met two men on horseback, on their way to the village. Theypassed on without specially noticing me, and I kept on my way untilreaching the farmhouse. I was so hungry, I went in and asked for food.While I was eating, the men whom I had met rode up. They had been to thevillage, and, learning that a runaway slave was wanted, and rememberingmeeting me, they returned in hot haste, in hope of finding me andsecuring the reward. They hallooed to the people in the house, an oldwoman and her daughter, whom they seemed to know, saying: "There is arunaway nigger out, who stole off a boat this evening." The old ladysaid, "Come," becoming frightened at once. When they came in they beganto question me. I trembled all over but answered them. They said: "Youare the fellow we want, who ran off the boat." I was too scared to denyit; so I owned I was on the boat, and stole off. They did not tarrylong, but, taking me with them, they went, about a mile and a half, totheir house. They planned and talked all the way, and one said: "We aregood for 75.00 for him any way." The next morning they took me into thevillage. They soon found out that the engineer, by order of the captain,had stayed over to search for me. A lawsuit followed, and I was takenbefore the magistrate before the engineer could get possession of me.There was a legal course that had to be gone through with. A lawyer, Foxby name, furnished the 75.00 for the men who had caught me. That partof the case being settled, Fox and the engineer started for Evansville,Ind., that same night. Upon arriving there, Fox received from thecaptain of the boat the money he had advanced to the men who caught me;and we went on, arriving at Louisville, Ky., the next day. I was thentaken again before a magistrate, by the captain, when the followingstatement was read by that official:"Captain Montgomery brought forth a boy, and said he is the property ofEdmund McGee, of Memphis, Tenn. Come forth owner, and prove property,for after the boy shall remain in jail six months he shall be sold topay jail feed."Mr. McGee was informed of my whereabouts, and it was not long before heand his cousin came to get me. When they came, I was called up by thenickname they had given me, "Memphis." "Come out here, 'Memphis,'" saidthe turnkey, "your master has come for you." I went down stairs to theoffice, and found Boss waiting for me. "Hello, Lou!" said he, "what areyou doing here, you dog?" I was so frightened I said nothing. Of course,some few words were passed between him and the officers. I heard him saythat I was a smart fellow, and he could not tell why I had run away;that he had always treated me well. This was to impress the officerswith the idea that he was not unkind to his slaves. The slave-holdersall hated to be classed as bad taskmasters. Yet nearly all of them were.The clothes I wore were jail property, and he could not take me away inthem; so we started to go up town to get others. As we passed out thejailer, Buckhanon, said: "Ain't you going to put hand-cuffs on him?""Oh, no!" said Boss. After I was taken to the store and fitted with anew suit of clothes, he brought me back to the jail, where I washedmyself and put on the new garments. When all was complete, and I seemedto suit master's fastidious eye, he took me to the Gault House, where hewas stopping. In the evening we started for home, and reached Memphisthe following day. Boss did not flog me, as I expected, but sent me tomy regular routine work. We had been in this new home so short a time hedid not want it to be rumored that he whipped his slaves, he was sostylish and rich. But the madam was filled with rage, although she didnot say much. I think they saw that I was no longer a child--they fearedI would go again. But after I had been home some three or four weeks,Madam Sarah commenced her old tricks--attempting to whip me, box my jawsand pinch me. If any little thing was not pleasing to her at meal time,it was a special delight for her to reach out, when I drew near to herto pass something, and give me a blow with her hand. Truly it was amonstrous domestic institution that not only tolerated, but fostered,such an exhibition of table manners by a would-be fine lady--such vulgarspite and cruelty!       *       *       *       *       *MY SECOND RUNAWAY TRIP.About three months after my first attempt to get away, I thought I wouldtry it again. I went to Memphis, and saw a boat at the landing, calledthe John Lirozey, a Cincinnati packet. This boat carried the mail. Shehad come into port in the morning, and was being unloaded. I went aboardin the afternoon and jumped down into the hull. Boss had been there inthe fore part of the afternoon inquiring for me, but I did not know itthen. After I had been in the boat some time, the men commenced loadingit. I crept up in the corner and hid myself. At first two or threehundred dry and green hides were thrown in, and these hid me; but lateron two or three tiers of cotton bales were put in the center of thehull, and, when the boat started, I got upon the top of these, and laythere. I could hear the people talking above me, but it was so dark Icould not see anything--it was dark as a dungeon. I had lain there twonights and began to get so weak and faint I could stand it no longer.For some reason the boat did not start the day I went aboard,consequently, I had not gotten as far from home as I expected, and myprivations had largely been in vain. Despairing and hungry, on thethird day, I commenced howling and screaming, hoping that some onewould hear me, and come to my relief, for almost anything else wouldhave been preferable to the privation and hunger from which I wassuffering. But I could make no one hear, at least no one paid anyattention to my screams, if they did hear. In the evening, however, oneof the deck hands came in with a lantern to look around and seeeverything was all right. I saw the light and followed him out, but Ihad been out of my hiding only a short time when I was discovered by aman who took me up stairs to the captain. It was an effort for me towalk up stairs, as I was weak and faint, having neither eaten nor drankanything for three days. This boat was crowded with passengers, and itwas soon a scene of confusion. I was placed in the pilot's room forsafety, until we arrived at a small town in Kentucky called Monroe. Iwas put off here to be kept until the packet came back from Cincinnati.Then I was carried back to Memphis, arriving about one o'clock at night,and, for safe keeping, was put into what was called the calaboose. Thiswas especially for the keeping of slaves who had run away and beencaught. Word was sent to Boss of my capture; and the next morningThomas Bland, a fellow servant of mine, was sent to take me home. I cannot tell how I felt, for the only thought that came to me was that Ishould get killed. The madam met us as we drove into the yard. "Ah!" shesaid to me, "you put up at the wrong hotel, sir." I was taken to thebarn where stocks had been prepared, beside which were a cowhide and apail of salt water, all prepared for me. It was terrible, but there wasno escape. I was fastened in the stocks, my clothing removed, and thewhipping began. Boss whipped me a while, then he sat down and read hispaper, after which the whipping was resumed. This continued for twohours. Fastened as I was in the stocks, I could only stand and take lashafter lash, as long as he desired, the terrible rawhide cutting into myflesh at every stroke. Then he used peach tree switches, which crackedthe flesh so the blood oozed out. After this came the paddle, two and ahalf feet long and three inches wide. Salt and water was at once appliedto wash the wounds, and the smarting was maddening. This torture wascommon among the southern planters. God only knows what I suffered underit all, and He alone gave me strength to endure it. I could hardly moveafter the terrible ordeal was finished, and could scarcely bear myclothes to touch me at first, so sore was my whole body, and it wasweeks before I was myself again.       *       *       *       *       *PREACHING TO THE SLAVES.As an offset, probably, to such diabolical cruelties as those which werepracticed upon me in common with nearly all the slaves in the cottonregion of the south, it was the custom in the section of country where Ilived to have the white minister preach to the servants Sundayafternoon, after the morning service for the whites. The white peoplehired the minister by the year to preach for them at their church. Thenhe had to preach to each master's slaves in turn. The circuit was madeonce a month, but there was service of some kind every Sunday. Theslaves on some places gathered in the yard, at others in the whitefolks' school houses, and they all seemed pleased and eager to hear theword of God. It was a strong evidence of their native intelligence anddiscrimination that they could discern the difference between the truthsof the "word" and the professed practice of those truths by theirmasters. My Boss took pride in having all his slaves look clean and tidyat the Sabbath service; but how would he have liked to have the slaves,with backs lacerated with the lash, appear in those assemblies withtheir wounds uncovered? The question can never be answered. The masterand most of his victims have gone where professions of righteousnesswill not avail to cover the barbarities practised here.       *       *       *       *       *A FAMILY OF FREE PERSONS SOLD INTO SLAVERY.My wife Matilda was born in Fayette county, Kentucky, June 17th, 1830.It seems that her mother and her seven children were to have been freeaccording to the old Pennsylvania law. There were two uncles of thefamily who were also to have been free, but who had been kept over time;so they sued for their freedom, and gained it. The lawyers in the casewere abolitionists and friends to the slaves, and saw that these men hadjustice. After they had secured their freedom, they entered suit for mywife's mother, their sister, and her seven children. But as soon as thebrothers entered this suit, Robert Logan, who claimed my wife's motherand her children as his slaves, put them into a trader's yard inLexington; and, when he saw that there was a possibility of their beingsuccessful in securing their freedom, he put them in jail, to be "solddown the river." This was a deliberate attempt to keep them from theirrights, for he knew that they were to have been set free, many yearsbefore; and this fact was known to all the neighborhood. My wife'smother was born free, her mother, having passed the allotted time undera law, had been free for many years. Yet they kept her children asslaves, in plain violation of law as well as justice. The children offree persons under southern laws were free--this was always admitted.The course of Logan in putting the family in jail, for safe keepinguntil they could be sent to the southern market, was a tacit admissionthat he had no legal hold upon them. Woods and Collins, a couple of"nigger traders," were collecting a "drove" of slaves for Memphis, aboutthis time, and, when they were ready to start, all the family were sentoff with the gang; and, when they arrived in Memphis, they were put inthe traders' yard of Nathan Bedford Forrest. This Forrest afterwardbecame a general in the rebel army, and commanded at the capture of FortPillow; and, in harmony with the debasing influences of his earlybusiness, he was responsible for the fiendish massacre of negroes afterthe capture of the fort--an act which will make his name foreverinfamous. None of this family were sold to the same person except mywife and one sister. All the rest were sold to different persons. Theelder daughter was sold seven times in one day. The reason of this wasthat the parties that bought her, finding that she was not legally aslave, and that they could get no written guarantee that she was, gotrid of her as soon as possible. It seems that those who bought the othermembers of the family were not so particular, and were willing to runthe risk. They knew that such things--such outrages upon law andjustice--were common. Among these was my Boss, who bought two of thegirls, Matilda and her sister Mary Ellen. Matilda was bought for a cook;her sister was a present to Mrs. Farrington, his wife's sister, to actas her maid and seamstress. Aunt Delia, who had been cook, was givenanother branch of work to do, and Matilda was installed as cook. Iremember well the day she came. The madam greeted her, and said: "Well,what can you do, girl? Have you ever done any cooking? Where are youfrom?" Matilda was, as I remember her, a sad picture to look at. She hadbeen a slave, it is true, but had seen good days to what the slavesdown the river saw. Any one could see she was almost heart-broken--shenever seemed happy. Days grew into weeks and weeks into months, but thesame routine of work went on.       *       *       *       *       *MY MARRIAGE--BIRTH OF TWINS.Matilda had been there three years when I married her. The Boss hadalways promised that he would give me a nice wedding, and he kept hisword. He was very proud, and liked praise. The wedding that he gave uswas indeed a pleasant one. All the slaves from their neighboracquaintances were invited. One thing Boss did was a credit to him, butit was rare among slave-holders--he had me married by their parishminister. It was a beautiful evening, the 30th of November, 1858, whenMatilda and I stood in the parlor of the McGee house and were solemnlymade man and wife. Old Master Jack came up from Panola at that time, andwas there when the ceremony was performed. As he looked through hisfingers at us, he was overheard saying: "It will ruin them, givinwedins-wedins." Things went on as usual after this. The madam grew moreirritable and exacting, always finding fault with the servants, whippingthem, or threatening to do so, upon the slightest provocation, or noneat all. There was something in my wife's manner, however, which kept themadam from whipping her--an open or implied threat perhaps that suchtreatment would not be endured without resistance or protest of somekind. This the madam regarded as a great indignity, and she hated mywife for it, and, at times, was ready to crush her, so great was heranger. In a year there were born to us twin babies; and the madam nowthought she had my wife tied, as the babies would be a barrier toanything like resistance on her part, and there would be no danger ofher running away. She, therefore, thought that she could enjoy, withouthindrance, the privilege of beating the woman of whose womanhood she hadtheretofore stood somewhat in fear.       *       *       *       *       *MADAM'S CRUELTY TO MY WIFE AND CHILDREN.Boss said from the first that I should give my wife assistance, as sheneeded time to care for the babies. Really he was not as bad as themadam at heart, for she tried to see how hard she could be on us. Shegave me all the extra work to do that she could think of, apparently tokeep me from helping my wife in the kitchen. She had all the cooking todo for three heavy meals each day, all the washing and ironing of thefinest clothes, besides caring for the babies between times. In themorning she would nurse the babies, then hurry off to the kitchen to getbreakfast while they were left in charge of a little girl. Again at noonshe repeated her visit to the babies, after cooking the dinner, then inthe evening, after supper, she would go to nurse them again. Aftersupper was over, dishes all washed and kitchen in order, she would thengo to the little ones for the night. One can see that she had verylittle time with the children. My heart was sore and heavy, for my wifewas almost run to death with work. The children grew puny and sickly forwant of proper care. The doctor said it was because the milk the mothernursed to them was so heated by her constant and excessive labors as tobe unwholesome, and she never had time to cool before ministering tothem. So the little things, instead of thriving and developing, as wastheir right, dwindled toward the inevitable end. Oh! we werewretched--our hearts ached for a day which we could call our own. Mywife was a Christian, and had learned to know the worth of prayer, sowould always speak consolingly. "God will help us," she said: "let ustry and be patient." Our trial went on, until one morning I heard agreat fuss in the house, the madam calling for the yard man to come andtie my wife, as she could not manage her. My wife had always refused toallow the madam to whip her; but now, as the babies were here, mistressthought she would try it once more. Matilda resisted, and madam calledfor Boss. In a minute he came, and, grabbing my wife, commenced chokingher, saying to her: "What do you mean? Is that the way you talk toladies?" My wife had only said to her mistress: "You shall not whip me."This made her furious, hence her call for Boss. I was in the diningroom, and could hear everything. My blood boiled in my veins to see mywife so abused; yet I dare not open my mouth. After the fuss, my wifewent straight to the laundry. I followed her there, and found herbundling up her babies' clothes, which were washed but not ironed. Iknew at a glance that she was going away. Boss had just gone to thecity; and I did not know what to say, but I told her to do the best shecould. Often when company came and I held the horses, or did an errandfor them, they would tip me to a quarter or half a dollar. This money Ialways saved, and so had a little change, which I now gave to Matilda,for her use in her effort to get away from her cruel treatment. Shestarted at once for Forrest's trader's yards, with the babies in herarms and, after she got into Memphis, she stopped outside the yard torest. While she was sitting on the curb stone, Forrest came out of theyard by the back gate and saw her. Coming up to her he said: "My God!Matilda, what are you doing here? You have changed so I would not haveknown you. Why have you come here?" Matilda said: "I came back here tobe sold again." He stepped back and called another "nigger trader,"Collins by name, from Kentucky. "Look here," said Forrest, pointing tomy wife. Collins took in the situation at once and said he would buy herand the children. "That woman is of a good family," said he, "and wasonly sold to prevent her from getting her freedom." She was then takeninto the yard. "Oh!" said Forrest, "I know these McGees, they are hardcolts." Word was then sent McGee that his cook was in the yard and hadcome to be sold. He went in haste to the yard. Collins offered to buyher, but McGee said no man's money could buy that woman and herchildren. I raised her husband and I would not separate them. She wasbrought back, and as they rode along in the rockaway, Boss said: "When Iam through with you I guess you won't run away again." As they drove upI saw the madam go running out to meet them. She shouted to Matilda:"Ah! madam, you put up at the wrong hotel." They at once went to thebarn where my wife was tied to the joist, and Boss and the madam beather by turns. After they had finished the whipping, Boss said,tauntingly: "Now I am buying you and selling you--I want you to knowthat I never shall sell you while my head and yours is hot." I wastrembling from head to foot, for I was powerless to do anything for her.My twin babies lived only six months after that, not having had the carethey needed, and which it was impossible for their mother to give themwhile performing the almost endless labor required of her, under threatsof cruel beatings. One day not long after our babies were buried themadam followed my wife to the smoke house and said: "I am tempted totake that knife from you, Matilda, and cut you in two. You and old Ruben(one of the slaves) went all around the neighborhood and told the peoplethat I killed your babies, and almost whipped you to death." Of course,when the slaves were accused falsely, as in this case, they were notallowed to make any reply--they just had to endure in silence whateverwas said.       *       *       *       *       *EFFORTS TO LEARN TO READ AND WRITE.Thomas, the coachman, and I were fast friends. We used to get togetherevery time we had a chance and talk about freedom. "Oh!" Tom would say,"if I could only write." I remember when Tom first began to take lessonsat night from some plasterers, workmen of the neighborhood. They sawthat he was so anxious to learn that they promised to teach him everyevening if he would slip out to their house. I, too, was eager to learnto read and write, but did not have the opportunity which Tom had ofgetting out at night. I had to sleep in the house where the folks were,and could not go out without being observed, while Tom had quarters inanother part of the establishment, and could slip out unobserved. Tom,however, consoled me by saying that he would teach me as soon as he knewhow. So Tom one night put a copy of some figures on the side of the barnfor me to practice from. I took the chalk and imitated him as near as Icould, but my work was poor beside his, as he had been learning forsome months, and could make the figures quite well and write a little.Still I kept trying. Tom encouraging me and telling me that I wouldlearn in time. "Just keep trying," said he. When this first lesson wasover, I forgot to rub out the marks on the barn, and the next morningwhen Old Master Jack, who happened to be at our home just at that time,went out there and saw the copy and my imitation of it, he at onceraised great excitement by calling attention to the rude characters andwanting to know who had done that. I was afraid to own that I had doneit; but old Master Jack somehow surmised that it was Tom or I, for hesaid to Boss: "Edmund, you must watch those fellows, Louis and Thomas,if you don't they will get spoilt--spoilt. They are pretty close to townhere--here." Tom and I laughed over this a good deal and how easily weslipped out of it, but concluded not to stop trying to learn all wecould. Tom always said: "Lou, I am going to be a free man yet, then wewill need some education; no, let us never stop trying to learn." Tomwas a Virginian, as I was, and was sold from his parents when a merelad. Boss used to write to his parents (owners) occasionally, that hispeople might hear from him. The letters were to his mother, but sent incare of the white folks. Tom had progressed very fast in his secretstudies, and could write enough to frame a letter. It seems it had beenover a year since Boss had written for him, but nothing was said untilone morning I heard Boss telling Tom to come to the barn to be whipped.He showed Tom three letters which he had written to his mother, and thisso startled him that he said nothing. I listened breathlessly to eachword Boss said: "Where did you learn to write?" asked he, "and when didyou learn? How long have you been writing to your mother?" At thatmoment he produced the three letters which Tom had written. Boss, itseems, had mistrusted something, and spoke to the postmaster, tellinghim to stop any letters which Tom might mail for Virginia to his mother.The postmaster did as directed, for slaves had no rights whichpostmasters were bound to respect; hence, the letters fell into themaster's hands instead of going to their destination. Tom, not hearingfrom his first letter, wrote a second, then a third, never dreaming thatthey had been intercepted. Boss raged and Tom was severely whipped.After this nothing Tom did pleased any of the family--it was acontinual pick on him. Everything was wrong with both of us, for theywere equally hard on me. They mistrusted, I think, that I could write;yet I could not find out just what they did think.       *       *       *       *       *TOM STRIKES FOR LIBERTY AND GAINS IT.Tom stayed only a few weeks after this. He said to me, one morning:"Lou, I am going away. If I can get a boat to-night that is startingoff, why, I am gone from this place." I was sad to see him go, for hewas like a brother to me--he was my companion and friend. He went, andwas just in time to catch the boat at the Memphis dock. He succeeded ingetting on, and made an application to the captain to work on the boat.The captain did not hesitate to employ him, as it was common for slavesto be permitted to hire themselves out for wages which they wererequired to return, in whole or in part, to their masters. Of course allsuch slaves carried a written pass to this effect. Tom was shrewd; and,having learned to write fairly well, he wrote himself a pass, which wasof the usual kind, stating his name, to whom he belonged, and that hewas privileged to hire himself out wherever he could, coming and goingas he pleased. Where the slave was an exceptional one, and where theowner had only two or three slaves, a pass would readily be given tohire himself out, or hire his own time, as it was generally called, hebeing required to turn over to his master a certain amount of hisearnings, each month or week, and to make a report to his master of hiswhereabouts and receipts. Sometimes the slave would be required to turnin to his master a certain sum, as, for instance, fifty or one hundreddollars a year; and he would have to earn that before he could use anyof his earnings for himself. If he was a mechanic he would have littletrouble in doing this, as the wages of such were often quite liberal.This kind of a pass was rarely, if ever, given by the planters havinglarge numbers of slaves. Another kind of pass read something like this:"Pass my boy or my girl," as the case might be, the name being attached.These were only given to permit the slave to go from the farm of his ownmaster to that of another. Some men had wives or children belonging onneighboring farms, and would be given passes to visit them. Without sucha pass they were liable to be stopped and turned back to their homes.There was, however, a good deal of visiting without passes, but it wasagainst the general rule which required them; and any slave leaving homewithout a pass was liable to punishment if discovered. On our plantationpasses were never given, but the slaves did visit in the neighborhood,notwithstanding, and would sometimes slip into town at night. Tom had inthis way seen the pass of a neighboring slave to hire out; and it wasfrom this he learned the form from which he wrote his, and which openedhis way to freedom. Upon reading Tom's pass, the captain did nothesitate, but hired him at once; and Tom worked his way to New Orleans,to which city the boat was bound. In the meantime Boss took me and wedrove to numerous stations, where he telegraphed ahead for his run-awayboy Tom. But Tom reached New Orleans without hindrance, and there fellin with the steward of a Boston steamer, and, getting aboard of it, wassoon on the ocean, on his way to that city where were so many friends ofthe slave. Arriving there he made his way to Canada; which was, for somany generations, the only land of freedom attainable to Americanslaves.       *       *       *       *       *NEWS OF TOM'S REACHING CANADA.Now that Tom was gone, excitement prevailed at the house among thewhite folks--nothing had been heard of him or the method of his escape.All the servants expected that he would be caught, and I was alarmedevery time Boss came from the city, fearing that he had news that Tomwas caught. He had been gone about six months, when, one morning, I wentto the postoffice and brought back a letter. It seemed to me that I feltthat it contained something unusual, but I did not know what it was. Itproved to be a letter from Tom to Boss. They did not intend that theservants should know it was from Tom, but one of the house maids heardthem reading it, and came out and told us. She whispered: "Tom is free;he has gone to Canada; Boss read it in the letter Lou brought." Thisnews cheered me, and made me eager to get away; but I never heard fromhim any more until after the rebellion. Tom gone made my duties more. Inow had to drive the carriage, but Uncle Madison was kept at the barn todo the work there, and hitch up the team--I only had to drive when thefamily went out.       *       *       *       *       *M'GEE EXPECTS TO CAPTURE TOM.In the summer the McGees made up their minds to go down east, and comearound by Niagara Falls, for this was the place from which Tom hadwritten them. Boss had great confidence in himself, and did not doubthis ability to take Tom home with him if he should meet him, even thoughit should be in Canada. So he took a pair of handcuffs with him as apreparation for the enterprise. His young nephew had been to NiagaraFalls, and seen and talked with Tom; but Boss said if he had seen himanywhere he would have laid hands on him, at once, and taken him home,at all hazards.       *       *       *       *       *MAKING CLOTHES.When the family went on this visit down east I was left in charge of thehouse, and was expected to keep everything in order, and also to makethe winter clothes for the farm hands. The madam and I had cut out theseclothes before she left, and it was my principal duty to run the sewingmachine in their manufacture. Many whole days I spent in this work. Mywife made the button holes and sewed on the buttons. I made hundreds ofsacks for use in picking cotton. This work was always done in summer.When the garments were all finished they were shipped to the farm atBolivar, to be ready for the fall and winter wear. In like manner theclothes for summer use were made in winter.       *       *       *       *       *A SUPERSTITION.It was the custom in those days for slaves to carry voo-doo bags. It washanded down from generation to generation; and, though it was one of thesuperstitions of a barbarous ancestry, it was still very generally andtenaciously held to by all classes. I carried a little bag, which I gotfrom an old slave who claimed that it had power to prevent any one whocarried it from being whipped. It was made of leather, and containedroots, nuts, pins and some other things. The claim that it would preventthe folks from whipping me so much, I found, was not sustained by myexperience--my whippings came just the same. Many of the servants werethorough believers in it, though, and carried these bags all the time.       *       *       *       *       *MEMPHIS AND ITS COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE.The city of Memphis, from its high bluff on the Mississippi, overlooksthe surrounding country for a long distance. The muddy waters of theriver, when at a low stage, lap the ever crumbling banks that yearlychange, yielding to new deflections of the current. For hundreds ofmiles below there is a highly interesting and rarely broken series offorests, cane brakes and sand bars, covered with masses of willows andpoplars which, in the spring, when the floods come down, are overflowedfor many miles back. It was found necessary to run embankmentspractically parallel with the current, in order to confine the waters ofthe river in its channel. Memphis was and is the most important city ofTennessee, indeed, the most important between St. Louis and New Orleans,particularly from the commercial point of view. Cotton was the principalproduct of the territory tributary to it. The street running along thebluff was called Front Row, and was filled with stores and businesshouses. This street was the principal cotton market, and here thearticle which, in those days, was personified as the commercial "king,"was bought and sold, and whence it was shipped, or stored, awaiting anadvancing price. The completion of the Memphis and Charleston railroadwas a great event in the history of the city. It was termed the marriageof the Mississippi and the Atlantic, and was celebrated with a greatpopular demonstration, people coming from the surrounding country formany miles. Water was brought from the Atlantic ocean and poured intothe river; and water taken from the river and poured into the Atlanticat Charleston. It was anticipated that this railroad connection betweenthe two cities would make of Charleston the great shipping port, and ofMemphis the principal cotton market of the southwest. The expectation inneither of these cases has been fully realized. Boss, in common withplanters and business men throughout that whole region, was greatlyexcited. I attended him and thus had the opportunity of witnessing thisnotable celebration.[Illustration]CHAPTER III.SLAVERY AND THE WAR OF THE REBELLION.       *       *       *       *       *BEGINNING OF THE WAR.I remember well when Abraham Lincoln was elected. Boss and the madam hadbeen reading the papers, when he broke out with the exclamation: "Thevery idea of electing an old rail splitter to the presidency of theUnited States! Well he'll never take his seat." When Lincoln wasinaugurated, Boss, old Master Jack and a great company of men met at ourhouse to discuss the matter, and they were wild with excitement. Was notthis excitement an admission that their confidence in their ability towhip the Yankees, five or six to one, was not so strong as theypretended?The war had been talked of for some time, but at last it came. When therebels fired upon Fort Sumter, then great excitement arose. The next daywhen I drove Boss to town, he went into the store of one Williams, amerchant, and when he came out, he stepped to the carriage, and said:"What do you think? Old Abraham Lincoln has called for four hundredthousand men to come to Washington immediately. Well, let them come; wewill make a breakfast of them. I can whip a half dozen Yankees with mypocket knife." This was the chief topic everywhere. Soon after this Bossbought himself a six shooter. I had to mould the bullets for him, andevery afternoon he would go out to practice. By his direction, I fixed alarge piece of white paper on the back fence, and in the center of itput a large black dot. At this mark he would fire away, expecting to hitit; but he did not succeed well. He would sometimes miss the fenceentirely, the ball going out into the woods beyond. Each time he wouldshoot I would have to run down to the fence to see how near he came tothe mark. When he came very near to it--within an inch or so, he wouldsay laughingly: "Ah! I would have got him that time." (Meaning a Yankeesoldier.) There was something very ludicrous in this pistol practice ofa man who boasted that he could whip half a dozen Yankees with ajackknife. Every day for a month this business, so tiresome to me, wenton. Boss was very brave until it came time for him to go to war, whenhis courage oozed out, and he sent a substitute; he remaining at home asa "home guard." One day when I came back with the papers from the city,the house was soon ringing with cries of victory. Boss said: "Why, thatwas a great battle at Bull Run. If our men had only known, at first,what they afterwords found out, they would have wiped all the Yankeesout, and succeeded in taking Washington."       *       *       *       *       *PETTY DISRESPECT TO THE EMBLEM OF THE UNION.Right after the bombardment of Fort Sumter, they brought to Memphis theUnion flag that floated over the fort. There was a great jubilee incelebration of this. Portions of the flag, no larger than a half dollarin paper money, were given out to the wealthy-people, and theseevidences of their treason were long preserved as precious treasures.Boss had one of these pieces which he kept a long time; but, as therebel cause waned these reminders of its beginning were less and lessseen, and if any of them are now in existence, it is not likely thattheir possessors will take any pride in exposing them to view.As the war continued we would, now and then, hear of some slave of ourneighborhood running away to the Yankees. It was common when themessage of a Union victory came to see the slaves whispering to eachother: "We will be free." I tried to catch everything I could about thewar, I was so eager for the success of the Union cause. These thingswent on until       *       *       *       *       *THE BATTLE OF SHILOH, APRIL 9, 1862.Boss came hurrying in one morning, right after breakfast, calling to me:"Lou, Lou, come; we have a great victory! I want to go up and carry theboys something to eat. I want you and Matilda to get something ready asquickly as you can." A barrel of flour was rolled into the kitchen, andmy wife and I "pitched in" to work. Biscuit, bread, hoe-cake, ham,tongue--all kinds of meat and bread were rapidly cooked; and, though thetask was a heavy one for my wife and me, we worked steadily; and, aboutfive o'clock in the afternoon the things were ready. One of the largebaskets used to hold cotton was packed full of these provisions. Ourlimbs ached from the strain of the work, for we had little help. Onereason for the anxiety of the Boss for the preparation of this provisionfor the soldiers was that he knew so many in one of the companies, whichwas known as the "Como Avengers," and he had a son, a nephew and abrother of his wife connected with it; the latter a major on Gen.Martin's staff. On the following morning I got up early, and hurriedwith my work to get through, as I had to go to the postoffice. Madamhurried me off, as she expected a letter from her husband, who hadpromised to write, at the earliest moment, of their friends andrelatives. I rushed into the city, at full speed, got some letters and amorning paper, and, returning as rapidly as possible, gave them to her.She grasped them eagerly, and commenced reading the paper. In a shorttime I heard her calling me to come to her. I went in, and she said, ingreat excitement: "Louis, we want to have you drive us into town, to seethe Yankee prisoners, who are coming through, at noon, from Shiloh." Iwent and told Madison to hitch up, as soon as he could. In the meantimeI got myself ready, and it was not long before we were off for the city.The madam was accompanied by a friend of hers, a Mrs. Oliver. We were atthe station in plenty of time. About twelve o'clock the train fromShiloh drew into the station; but the prisoners that were reported to beon board were missing--it proved to be a false report. While they werelooking for the prisoners, Mrs. Oliver saw Jack, a servant of EdwardMcGee, brother of madam. "Oh! Look," said Mrs. Oliver, "there isEdward's Jack. Lou, run and call him." In a minute I was off thecarriage, leaving the reins in madam's hands. Jack came up to thecarriage, and the women began to question him: "Where is your Master,Ed," asked both of them. "He is in the car, Missis--he is shot in theankle," said Jack. In a minute the women were crying. "I was going toget a hack," said Jack, "to--" "No, No!" said both of them. "Go, Lou,and help Jack to bring him to our carriage. You can drive him moresteadily than the hackman." Jack and I went to the car, and helped himout, and after some effort, got him into our carriage. Then I went andgot a livery hack to take the women and his baggage home. When wereached home, we found there old Mrs. Jack McGee, mother of the madam,Mrs. Charles Dandridge, Mrs. Farrington, sisters of madam, and Fanny, acolored woman, Edward's housekeeper and mistress--a wife in all butname. All of these had come to hear the news of the great battle, forall had near relatives in it. Mrs. Jack McGee and Mrs. Dr. CharlesDandridge had each a son in the terrible conflict.       *       *       *       *       *MOURNING IN MASTER'S FAMILY.In the afternoon, when all were seated in the library reading, and I wasin the dining room, finishing up my work, I happened to look out of thewindow, and saw a messenger coming up the graveled walk. I went out tomeet him. "Telegram for Mrs. McGee," he said. I took it to her; and,reading it without a word, she passed it to the next member of thefamily, and so it was passed around until all had read it except Mrs.Dandridge. When it was handed to her, I saw, at a glance, that itcontained for her the most sorrowful tidings. As she read she becamelivid, and when she had finished she covered her face with herhandkerchief, giving a great, heavy sob. By this time the whole familywas crying and screaming: "Oh! our Mack is killed." "Mars, Mack iskilled," was echoed by the servants, in tones of heart-felt sorrow, forhe was an exceptional young man. Every one loved him--both whites andblacks. The affection of the slaves for him bordered on reverence, andthis was true not alone of his father's slaves, but of all those whoknew him. This telegram was from Boss, and announced that he would behome the next day with the remains. Mrs. Farrington at once wrote to oldMaster Jack and to Dr. Dandridge, telling them of Mack's death and tocome at once. After I mailed those letters nothing unusual happenedduring the afternoon, and the house was wrapped in silence and gloom. Onthe following morning I went for the mail as usual, but there wasnothing new. At noon, the remains of the much loved young man arrived atour station, accompanied by Boss and Dr. Henry Dandridge, brother of thefather of the deceased, who was a surgeon in the rebel army. I went tothe station with another servant, to assist in bringing the body to thehouse. We carried it into the back parlor, and, after all had been madeready, we proceeded to wash and dress it. He had lain on the battlefieldtwo days before he was found, and his face was black as a piece of coal;but Dr. Henry Dandridge, with his ready tact, suggested the idea ofpainting it. I was there to assist in whatever way they needed me. Afterthe body was all dressed, and the face painted, cheeks tinted with arosy hue, to appear as he always did in life, the look was natural andhandsome. We were all the afternoon employed in this sad work, and itwas not until late in the evening that his father and mother came downto view the body for the first time. I remember, as they came down thebroad stairs together, the sorrow-stricken yet calm look of those twopeople. Mrs. Dandridge was very calm--her grief was too great for her toscream as the others did when they went in. She stood and looked at herMack; then turning to Boss, she said: "Cousin Eddie, how brave he was!He died for his country." Poor, sorrowing, misguided woman! It was notfor his country he died, but for the perpetuation of the cruel, theinfamous system of human slavery. All the servants were allowed to comein and view the body. Many sad tears were shed by them. Some of theolder slaves clasped their hands, as if in mute prayer, and exclaimed,as they passed by the coffin: "He was a lovin boy." It seems that allhis company but five or six were killed. At an early hour next morningthe funeral party started for the home in Panola, where the body of thelamented young man, sacrificed to an unholy cause, was buried, at theclose of the same day.Edward stayed at our house some six weeks, his ankle was so slow ingetting well. At the end of that time, he could walk with the aid ofcrutches, and he took Fanny and went home.       *       *       *       *       *ALARM OF THE MEMPHIS REBELS.Not long after this the people were very much worked up over themilitary situation. The Yankees had taken Nashville, and had begun tobombard Fort Pillow. The officials of the Memphis and Ohio railroadcompany became alarmed at the condition of things, fearing for thesafety of their stock. The officers, therefore, set about devising someplan by which they might get the cars down on the Memphis and Jacksonroad, where they imagined their property would be safe from the nowterrible Yankees. The railroad officials at once set to work to buy theright of way through Main street, to give them the connection with thesouthern road named. At first it was refused by the city authorities,but finally the right of way was granted. When, however, the railroadmen began to lay the ties and rails, the people grew furious. Some fledat once, for they imagined that this act of the railroad officialsindicated that the Yankees must be coming pretty near. Boss became soexcited, at this time, that he almost felt like going away too. Thefamily grew more and more uneasy; and it was the continual talk: "Wemust get away from Memphis. The companies are already moving theirrolling stock, fearing the Yankees may come at any time and destroyeverything; we must get away," said Boss, speaking to the madam.       *       *       *       *       *THE FAMILY FLEE FROM MEMPHIS.Things continued in this way until about June, 1862. The Union troopshad taken Fort Pillow. We had heard the firing of cannon, and did notknow what it meant. One morning I was in the city after the mail, and Ilearned that a transient boat had just come down the river, which hadlost a part of her wheelhouse. She was fired on from Fort Pillow,sustaining this serious damage from the shot. This increased theexcitement among the people; and our folks became alarmed right away,and commenced talking of moving and running the servants away from theYankees, to a place of safety. McGee was trying for some time to getsome one to take the house, that is, to live in and care for it untilafter the war, while the family were gone. They never thought thatslavery would be abolished, and so hoped to come back again. After somesearch, they found a widow, a Mrs. Hancock. She was to have full chargeof the house and continue keeping boarders, as she had been doing inMemphis. The vaunted courage of this man seems to have earlydisappeared, and his thought was chiefly devoted to getting his familyand his slaves into some obscure place, as far away as possible from theYankees, that were to be so easily whipped. We were about two weeksgetting ready to leave, stowing away some of the things they did notwant to move. The Boss and his family, my wife and I, and all the houseservants were to go to Panola, to his father's. The family went by rail,but I had to drive through in a wagon.       *       *       *       *       *I AM TAKEN TO BOLIVAR FARM.Soon after the family all reached Master Jack's, Boss took me to his ownfarm in Bolivar county. This separated me for a time from my wife, forshe remained with the family. I had to look after the house, at thefarm, attend the dining room, and, between meals, sew every day, makingclothes for the hands. I could run on the machine eighteen to twentypairs of pants a day, but two women made the button holes and did thebasting for me, getting the goods all ready for the machine.       *       *       *       *       *CAPTURE OF A UNION TRADING BOAT.The Yankees had made a raid through Bolivar, before I came, and theexcitement had not abated, as they were spreading themselves all throughthe state. There was a Union trading boat, the Lake City, that had beensuccessful in exchanging her goods for cotton that came from Memphis.She usually stopped at Helena, Fryer's Point and other small towns; buton a trip at this time she came about fifty miles farther down theriver, to Carson's Landing, right at Boss' farm. She was loaded with allkinds of merchandise--sugar, tobacco, liquor, etc. She had a crew ofabout forty men, but they were not well prepared for a vigorous defense.The rebel soldiers stationed in the vicinity saw her as she dropped heranchor near the landing, and they determined to make an effort for hercapture. They put out pickets just above our farm, and allowed no one topass, or stop to communicate with the boat. Every one that sought topass was held prisoner, and every precaution taken to prevent those onthe boat from learning of the purposes of the rebels, knowing that theboat would land in the morning, if not informed of the danger, and thenit was anticipated that they could easily make her a prize. There was asmall ferry boat behind the steamer, and as the latter dropped downstream, and then steamed up to the landing, the former stood off for afew moments. As the steamer touched shore, the rebels charged on her,and captured her without a struggle. In the meantime the ferry boat,seeing what had happened, sped away up stream, the soldiers firing ather, but doing little damage, except the breaking of the glass in thepilot house. The rebels, seeing that the ferry boat had escaped them,turned their attention to the unloading of the steamer. They sent outfor help in this work, and the summons was answered by the neighbors farand near. Wagons were brought, two of which were from our farm, andloaded with goods, which were taken to Deer Creek, forty miles fromCarson Landing. What goods they found themselves unable to carry awaywere packed in the warehouse. The steamer was then burned. McGee waspresent, and the rebel captain gave him a written statement of theaffair to the effect that the residents were not responsible for it, andthat this should be a protection for them against the Union forces. Theofficers and crew of the steamer to the number of forty were madeprisoners, and taken to Deer Creek, the rebel headquarters of thatregion, and put in the jail there. The ferry boat that escaped went toHelena, Arkansas, and carried the news of the affair to the Union forcesthere.       *       *       *       *       *BOSS TAKEN PRISONER.I was told by Boss to take my stand on our veranda, and keep watch onthe river, and if I saw any boat coming down to let him know at once. Ikept a close watch the next morning until about eight o'clock, when Isaw a boat, but she had almost gone past our house before I discoveredher. I ran into the house and told Boss. He ordered me to get his horseat once, which I did; and he mounted and went down to the landing asfast as he could. Upon reaching there, he was taken prisoner by theUnion soldiers, who had just landed from the boat. All who came nearwere captured. The Union soldiers went to work and transferred all thegoods which the rebels had put into the warehouse from the boat whichthey had captured, then setting fire to the warehouse and thepostoffice, they pushed off yelling and shouting with glee. Among thosecaptured by the Union soldiers were three other rich planters besidesBoss, all of whom were taken to Helena. After they had been there abouta week, the planters offered to secure the release of the Unionistscaptured on the boat which the rebels had burned at Carson Landing, andwho had been sent to the rebel jail at Deer Creek, if they wereguaranteed their own release in exchange. They offered to bear theexpense of a messenger to the rebel officer, at Deer Creek, with thisproposition. The Union officer at Helena accepted the proposition, andthe messenger was sent off. It was arranged that he should stop over atour house, both on his way down and back. Upon his return, he stoppedover night, and the next morning proceeded on his way. When he had goneabout five miles, he saw a flat-boat at a landing, on which were peopledrinking and having a merry time. He stopped, and went aboard; and, injoining the carousal, he soon became so intoxicated that he was unableto go on with his journey. Among those present was one Gilcrease, acousin of the McGees, who recognized the man as the messenger in thisimportant business, went to him and asked him for the letters hecarried. The fellow refusing to give them up, Gilcrease took them fromhim, and at once sent to our overseer for a reliable man by whom toforward them to the commandant at Helena. The overseer called me upfrom the cabin to his room, and told me that I was to go to Helena tocarry some important papers, and to come to him for them in the morning,and make an early start. I left him and went back to my cabin.       *       *       *       *       *MY THIRD EFFORT FOR FREEDOM.I made up my mind that this would be a good chance for me to run away. Igot my clothes, and put them in an old pair of saddle bags--two bagsmade of leather, connected with a strip of leather, and used whentraveling horseback for the same purpose as a satchel is used intraveling in the cars. I took these bags, carried them about a half mileup the road, and hid them in a fence corner, where I could get them inthe morning when I had started on my trip. Fryer's Point, the place towhich I was to go, was about fifty miles from the farm. I started earlyin the morning, and, after I had gone twenty-five miles, I came to thefarm of William McGee, a brother of the madam, and stopped to changehorses. I found that William McGee was going, in the morning, down toold Master Jack's; so I took one of their horses, leaving mine to use inits place, went right to Fryer's Point, delivered the letters to a manthere to carry to Helena, and got back to William McGee's farm thatnight. I made up my mind to go with William down to Panola, where madamwas, to tell her about Boss being captured. The next morning, hestarted, and Gibson, his overseer and myself accompanied him. Hequestioned me about the capture of Boss, what the soldiers had done,etc., and I told him all I knew of the matter. "Well, Lou," he said,"why did you not bring us some whisky?" "I did bring a little with me,"I said. He laughed, saying: "Oh, well, when we come to some clear waterwe will stop and have a drink." Then I said: "Mr. Smith will look for meto-night, but he wont see me. I am going to tell the madam that Boss iscaptured." "Hey, ho!" he said, "then you are running away." I replied:"Well I know Miss Sarah don't know Boss is in prison." We traveled on,all three of us, stopping at intervals to be refreshed. After two days,we arrived at Panola. Our journey was a tedious one. The streams were soswollen in places that we could hardly pass. The Tallehatchie we had toswim, and one of the men came near losing his horse and his life. Thehorses became tangled in a prep vine, as we were nearing the shore atwhich we aimed, and, the current being very swift, we were carriedbelow the landing place; but, finally, we got safely ashore, McGeelanding, and we following. Reaching Panola, wet and weary, I conveyed tomadam the story of her husband's capture and imprisonment, a rumor ofwhich had already reached her.The next morning was Christmas, and a number of the family had come tospend it together. They had heard that McGee was captured and in prison;but, now, as I told them every feature of the affair in detail, theygrew excited and talked wildly about it. Among those who came were Dr.Dandridge and his wife, Blanton McGee and his wife, Tim Oliver and hiswife. All these women were daughters of old Master Jack McGee, andsisters to the madam. Mrs. Farrington and old lady McGee were alreadythere. These re-unions on Christmas were a long established custom withthem, but the pleasure of this one was sadly marred by the vicissitudesand calamities of the war. A shadow hung over all the family group. Theyasked me many questions about Boss, and, of course, I related all Iknew.After I had been there three days, they started me back with letters forBoss. When I left it was near night, and I was to stop over at MasterJack's farm fifteen miles away. It was expected that I would reachFryer's Point on the third morning, thus allowing me three days to gosixty miles; but I could not make much headway, as the roads were soheavy. The understanding was that I was to deliver the letters to thesame gentleman, at Fryer's, to whom I delivered the others, forforwarding to Boss at Helena. I was then to go straight to the farm atBoliver, and report to Smith, the overseer. But after I had got aboutfour miles away, I concluded that I would not go back to the farm, buttry to get to the Yankees. I knew I had disobeyed Smith by going down tothe madam's to tell her about Boss, because he told me not to go when Ispoke to him about it. And now if I went back I feared he would kill me;for I knew there would be no escape for me from being run into the bullring, and that torture I could not think of enduring. I, therefore,stopped, and, taking the bridle and saddle from the horse, hid them inthe corner of a fence in a cornfield. Then I went into the woods. Thepapers which I had were in the saddlebag safe. The place where I stayedin the daytime was in a large shuck-pen--a pen built in the field tofeed stock from, in the winter time. This pen was on Dr. Dandridge'sfarm; and the second night I worked my way up near the house. Knowingall the servants, I was watching a chance to send word to the coachman,Alfred Dandridge, that I wanted him to tell my wife that I was not gone.I went down to his cabin, in the quarters; and, after a short time hecame. I was badly scared, and my heart was heavy and sore; but he spokecomfortingly to me, and I was cheered, somewhat, especially when hepromised to see Matilda, and tell her of my whereabouts. He gave me somefood, and hid me away for the night in his house. I kept close all thenext day; and, at night, when all was still, Alfred and I crept out, andwent to old Master Jack's. The distance was not great, and we sooncovered it. Alfred went in and told my wife that I was outside andwanted to see her. She came out, and was so frightened and nervous thatshe commenced sobbing and crying, and almost fainted when I told her, inlow tones, that I was going to try to get to Memphis, and that Alfredwas helping to plan a way to this end. The rebels occupied both roadsleading to Memphis, and I was puzzled to know how to reach the citywithout coming in contact with them. Two days after I had talked withmy wife, the rebel troops who were camped on the Holly Springs road leftfor some other point. My friend Alfred found this out, and came and toldme the encouraging news. The following night I went to old Master Jack'sand told my wife that the way now seemed clear, and that I was going atonce. I was bent on freedom, and would try for it again. I urged my wifenot to grieve, and endeavored to encourage her by saying that I wouldreturn for her, as soon as possible, should I succeed in getting to aland of freedom. After many tears and blessings, we parted, and I left,Uncle Alfred going with me some three miles, as I was not acquaintedwith the road. When he left me I went on alone with gloomy forebodings,but resolved to do my best in this hazardous undertaking, whatever mighthappen. The road passed over hills and through swamps, and I found thetraveling very wearisome. I had traveled some hours, and thought I wasdoing well; when, about one o'clock in the night, I came up out of along swamp, and, reaching the top of a hill, I stopped for a moment'srest, raising myself to an erect position from that of walking, inclinedby reason of weariness and the weight of the saddle-bags thrown acrossmy shoulders. The weather was bad, a heavy mist had come up, and was sodark that I could hardly see my way. As I started on, a soldier yelledat me from the mist: "Halt! advance and give the countersign." I stoppedimmediately, almost scared out of my wits. "Come right up here," saidthe soldier, "or I'll blow you into eternity." I saw at once he was arebel soldier. I knew not what to do. This place where I was halted wasNelson's farm, and the house was held as headquarters for a company ofrebel soldiers, known as bushwhackers. While they belonged to the rebelarmy, they were, in a measure, independent of its regulations anddiscipline, kept back in the woods, ready for any depredation upon theproperty of unionists--any outrage upon their persons. The soldier whohad halted me took me up to the house, and all began to question me. Itold them that I had been sent on an errand, and that I had lost my way.The next morning I was taken about a mile away down in the swamp, overhills and through winding paths, till at last we came to the regularrebel camp. I was in great fear and thought my end had come. Here theybegan to question me again--the captain taking the lead; but I stillstuck to my story that I had been sent on an errand, and had lost myway. I knew that this was my only chance. They tried to make me say thatI had come from the Yankees, as they were in camp near Holly Springs.They thought the Yankees had sent me out as a spy; but I said the sameas at first--that I had lost my way. A soldier standing by said: "Oh! wewill make you talk better than that;" and stepping back to his horse, hetook a sea-grass halter, and said: "I'll hang you." There was a law orregulation of the rebel government directing or authorizing the hangingof any slave caught running away; and this fellow was going to carry itout to the letter. I talked and pleaded for my life. My feelings wereindescribable. God only knows what they were. Dr. Carter, one of thesoldiers, who knew me and the entire McGee family, spoke up and said:"You had better let me go and tell Mr. Jack McGee about him." Thecaptain agreed to this, and the doctor went. The following day, Old Jackcame, and steadily refused to consent to my being hung. He said: "I knowEdmund would not have him hung-ung. He is too valuable-aluable. No, no!we will put him in jail and feed him on bread and water--too valuable anigger to be hung-ung."They tried again to make me say that I was with the Yankees. Theywhipped me a while, then questioned me again. The dog-wood switches thatthey used stung me terribly. They were commonly used in Mississippi forflogging slaves--one of the refinements of the cruelty of theinstitution of slavery. I refused to say anything different from what Ihad said; but when they had finished whipping me I was so sore I couldhardly move. They made up their minds to put me in jail at Panola,twenty-two miles away, to be fed on bread and water. The next day wasSunday, and all arrangements having been made for taking me to the placeappointed for those whose crime was a too great love for personalfreedom, they started with me, passing on the way Old Master Jack's,where they halted to let him know that his advice respecting me was tobe carried out. The old man called to my wife: "Come out and see Louis."Some one had told her that they were going to hang me; and I shall neverforget her looks as she came out in the road to bid me good-by. One ofthe soldiers was softened by her agony, and whispered to her: "Don'tcry, aunty, we are not going to hang him--we will only put him in jail."I saw this changed my wife's looks in a minute. I said a few words toher, and, with a prayer for God's blessing on us both, we parted, andthey moved on. After we had gone about seven miles, we met two soldiers,who belonged to the regiment at Nelson. They said: "Hello! where yougoing with that nigger?" The two men in charge of me replied: "We aregoing to take him to Panola jail." "Why," said one of the soldiers,"there is no jail there; the Yanks passed through and pulled down thedoors and windows of the jail, and let all the prisoners out." Thiscaused a stop; and a council of war was held in the fence corner, theresult of which was a decision to take me back to old Jack McGee's.After we had gotten back there, they took me and gave me anotherflogging to satisfy the madam. I was never so lacerated before. I couldhardly walk, so sore and weak was I. The law was given me that if ever Iwas caught out in the public road again, by any soldier, I was to beshot. Monday morning I was sent to the field to plow; and, though I wasvery stiff and my flesh seemed sore to the bone, my skin drawn andshriveled as if dead, I had, at least, to make the attempt to work. Tohave said: "Master, I am too sore to work," would only have gotten meanother whipping. So I obeyed without a word.       *       *       *       *       *REBELS BURN THEIR COTTON.The capture of Memphis by the Union troops closed the principal cottonmarket of the country, and there was, as a consequence, an immenseaccumulation of the product in the hands of the farmers of that region.They were, therefore, compelled to resort to temporary expedients forits protection from the elements. Old Master Jack had his piled up in along rick, and shelters built over it. Other farmers did the same. Ascotton was almost the only source of revenue for the farmers, and asthere was now no opportunity of getting it to market, there was such adearth of money as had seldom, if ever, been known, and a correspondingdearth of those necessaries of life which money was the only means ofprocuring. The accumulations of our family in this product were verygreat. While the rebel farmers were waiting for a time when they couldturn their stores of this valuable article into money, a proclamationwas issued by the rebel government that all the owners of cotton thathad it stored on their farms must prepare to have it burned. Hundreds ofrebel soldiers marched to every section of Mississippi that they couldreach, and applied the torch to these cotton ricks. The destruction wasenormous. This was to prevent the cotton from falling into the hands ofthe Unionists. Jeff Davis said to his deluded followers that it wasbetter for them to destroy this property than to risk its coming intothe possession of their enemies, since that would equally impoverishthemselves, while it might result to the pecuniary advantage of thosewith whom they were at war. I know that it was a terrible sight when ourcotton was burned. Hundreds of bales were consumed, and it seemed like awholly unnecessary destruction of property, and, therefore, unwise as awar measure. Many were sorry that they had acquiesced in the policy, asit cost them thousands of dollars, and made many poor. They thought thatpossibly their farms might have escaped the visits of the Unionsoldiers, and the property, so much needed, been saved in whole or inpart. They reasoned, and reasoned correctly, that their condition wouldin no sense have been worse if their cotton had not been burned by theirown soldiers, but might have been much better in many cases, without anyreal detriment to the rebel cause. The sacrifice of the property oftheir own people, by the rebel authorities, was evidence of thedesperation of the condition of the rebellion, and was so regarded bynot a few at that time. Those were terrible days. One could see anxietywritten on every face among the whites. The slaves even looked worriedat times, though the war meant so much to them, as they were alwayslooking forward to freedom, at its close, if the Union troops weresuccessful.       *       *       *       *       *MY FOURTH RUNAWAY TRIP.After I had been working on the farm about two months, and hadthoroughly talked the matter over with Alfred Dandridge, we planned tomake a careful and persistent effort to escape from the land of bondage.We thought that as others, here and there, all through the neighborhood,were going, we would make trial of it. My wife and I were at old MasterJacks; and, after we had consulted with Alfred and Lydia, his wife, weall concluded to go at once. Alfred had been a teamster for Dandridgefor many years, and was familiar with the road, as he had hauled cottoninto Memphis for his master for so long a time he could hardly tell whenhe began. Matt Dandridge was a fellow servant, belonging to the sameman, and both had, as was not unusual, taken their master's name, or,rather, were known by it. Matt had learned of our purpose to run away,and concluded to join our party. So one night, when all was still, westarted. Uncle Alfred, as I always called him, was to be our leader. Hewas older than any of the rest of us, and had had a good deal ofexperience; we, therefore, all looked to him--in fact, we reliedentirely upon him. After we had traveled about twelve miles, we came toa swamp, called Hicke-Halley. Here we stopped, as day was dawning, andsettled down for the day, as we could travel only in the night, lest weshould be seen and caught. We were wet--our clothes soaked through fromthe heavy dew. We had to travel through corn fields, cotton patches, oatfields and underbrush, not daring to take the main road. This is why wewere so wet. Uncle Alfred traveled wholly by the stars--they were hisguide. He knew by looking at them the four cardinal points of thecompass. Many old slaves were guided in this way when traveling in thenight, and some could tell the time of night by the position of thestars. We stayed in Hicke-Halley all day, and in the evening, when itwas dark enough, we started on again, Uncle Alfred offering up a prayerto God to guide us safely through. Cold Water was our next stoppingplace, and here a difficulty rose before us that made us fearful. We hadnothing to wear but what we had on, and not much of that, so had smallspace for carrying anything, and, therefore, had brought with us only alittle bite to eat. As we had lived on this small provision for a day,there was now but little left for our increasing wants; and thedifficulty of securing anything from the houses without danger ofdetection was almost insurmountable. But we felt encouraged as wethought of what we were striving for, and sped on our way. But the waywas hard, for sometimes we got completely stuck in brier patches, andhad to turn and go back, in order to find a way out. Old logs anddriftwood, that had been piled up year after year, were other obstaclesin our way; and one can imagine how hard it was to make our way throughsuch a mass of brush and forest by the dim light of the stars as theystruggled through the dense branches of the trees. We stumbled on,however, as best we could, each fearful, yet silently praying forguidance and help. When within four or five miles of Cold Water, UncleAlfred stopped, and cautioned us not to speak above a whisper, as therebel troops were camped on both sides of us. We were in a swamp betweenthe two roads, gradually working our way through to the river, as wecould not go on either of the roads for fear of detection. At thebridges, where these roads crossed the river, there were rebel camps,and it was useless for us to think of crossing either. We, therefore,worked our way carefully through the thicket that we were in until wecame within sight of the river. Then Uncle Alfred went ahead, creeping afew steps, then stopping to see if the river was clear of soldiers. Fromthis point it was some two and a half miles to the bridges, each way;and it was our idea that if we could cross here without being seen bythe soldiers, we would be all right. Uncle Alfred came back to us andtold us that he thought the way was clear. "I can not hear a sound,"said he, "so let us go on." We followed the river down until we came toa place where we could cross. Here we found some drift-wood--an old treehad been blown down, nearly across the river, leaving a space of abouttwenty feet. Over this natural bridge we crept to the open space whichwe waded, the water being up to our knees; but we did not mind this.There was no talking above a whisper, for fear of being heard by thesoldiers. Daylight had begun to dawn, and we felt good that we hadsucceeded thus far. We went on quietly until we got entirely out of theswamp and reached some hills. The woods were on each side of us andstill thick; so we stopped here, on the side of a hill, where the sunshone brightly on us, expecting to rest for the day. Our clothes hadalready become quite dry from the sunshine; and, so far, we felt allright. Alfred and I had made a turn around the place, listening to seeif we could hear any noise, or see any trace of soldiers; but wediscovered no trace of them, and went back to our stopping place. I hadbeen asleep and some of the others were still asleep, when suddenly Iheard the yelp of blood hounds in the distance. It seemed quite far awayat first, but the sound came nearer and nearer, and then we heard menyelling. We knew now that they were on our trail, and became sofrightened that we all leaped to our feet, and were about to run, whenUncle Alfred said: "Stop children, let me oil you feet." He had with hima bottle of ointment made of turpentine and onions, a preparation usedto throw hounds off a trail. All stopped; and the women, having theirfeet anointed first, started off, Uncle Alfred telling them to run indifferent directions. He and I were the last to start. Alfred said:"Don't let the bushes touch you;" at the same time he ran through thebushes with such a rattling noise one could have heard him a greatdistance. He wore one of those old fashioned oil cloth coats made inVirginia; and, as he ran, the bushes, striking against the coat, made anoise like the beating of a tin board with sticks. The funny part of itwas that, having cautioned us to be careful about noise, he made morethan all of us. By this time the woods were resounding with the yelpingof the hounds and the cries of their masters. The hounds numbered somefourteen. The men howled and cheered in concert with the brutes, forthey knew that they were on the right trail, and it would be but a shorttime before they caught us all. I had gotten further away than any ofthem. Having run about a mile, I came to a farm, and started across anopen field, hoping to reach a wood beyond, where I might conceal myself.Before I was half way across the field, on looking back, I saw the dogscoming over the fence, and knowing there was no chance of my getting tothe woods, I turned around, and ran back to a persimmon tree, and justhad time to run up one of the branches when the dogs came upon theground. I looked and saw the men, Williams the nigger-catcher, and Dr.Henry and Charles Dandridge. As soon as Williams rode up, he told me tocome down, but I was so frightened I began to cry, yet came downtrembling. The dogs laid hold of me at once, tearing my clothes andbiting my flesh. Dr. Dandridge was just riding up, and seeing what washappening, yelled out to Williams: "I thought your dogs didn't bite.""Oh! well," said Williams, "he aint hurt--we've got to let 'em bite alittle."They took us all back to the fence where I crossed over, all the othershaving been caught. Our hearts were filled with dismay. All looked as ifthey were condemned to be hung. We knew not what was to be done with us.The women were pitiful to see, crying and moaning--all courage utterlygone. They started back with us to Old Master Jack's, at Panola, and westopped for the night at a small farm house. The old woman who kept itsaid, tauntingly: "You niggers going to the Yankees? You all ought to bekilled." We started on the following morning, and got back home at oneo'clock in the afternoon. All of us were whipped. All the members of thefamily were very angry. Old Lady Jack McGee was so enraged that she saidto my wife: "I thought you were a Christian. You'll never see your God."She seemed to think that because Matilda had sought freedom she hadcommitted a great sin.       *       *       *       *       *INCIDENTS.Ever since the beginning of the war, and the slaves had heard thatpossibly they might some time be free, they seemed unspeakably happy.They were afraid to let the masters know that they ever thought of sucha thing, and they never dreamed of speaking about it except amongthemselves. They were a happy race, poor souls! notwithstanding theirdown-trodden condition. They would laugh and chat about freedom in theircabins; and many a little rhyme about it originated among them, and wassoftly sung over their work. I remember a song that Aunt Kitty, the cookat Master Jack's, used to sing. It ran something like this:     There'll be no more talk about Monday, by and by,     But every day will be Sunday, by and by.The old woman was singing, or rather humming, it one day, and old ladyMcGee heard her. She was busy getting her dinner, and I suppose neverrealized she was singing such an incendiary piece, when old Mrs. McGeebroke in upon her: "Don't think you are going to be free; you darkieswere made by God and ordained to wait upon us." Those passages ofScripture which refer to master and servants were always cited to uswhen we heard the Word preached; and they were interpreted as meaningthat the relation of master and slave was right and proper--that theywere rightly the masters and we the slaves.I remember, not long after Jeff Davis had been elected president of theConfederacy, that I happened to hear old Master Jack talking to some ofthe members of the family about the war, etc. All at once the old manbroke out: "And what do you think! that rascal, Abraham Lincoln, hascalled for 300,000 more men. What is Jeff Davis doin'-doin'?" He talkedon, and seemed so angry that he gave no one a chance to answer: "JeffDavis is a grand rascal-rascal," said he, "he ought to go into the fieldhimself." At first all the Southerners were jubilant over Davis; but asthey were losing so, and the Unionists gaining, they grew angry anddenounced him oftentimes in unsparing terms.       *       *       *       *       *UNION RAID AT MASTER'S FARM.During the time the Union headquarters were at Helena, a Union gun-boatcame down the river as far as Boliva, and stopped at Miles McGee's. Thesoldiers made a raid through the farm, taking chickens, turkeys, meatand everything that they could lay hands on. During this raid MilesMcGee came out of the house with a gun, and shot the commanding officerof the party. He became alarmed over what he had done, and hid in thecabin of one of the servants. He never came near the house. The Unionsoldiers came three different times to catch him, but never succeeded.The last time they came, he made for the canebrake, and hid himselfthere until they were gone. But though he had escaped their righteousvengeance, he became so nervous that he left his hiding place in thecanebraker, and went to Atlanta, Ga., and staid there among friendsuntil things became more quiet. At last wearying of this, he determinedto return to old Master Jack's, but not to his own home. Word had beenreceived of his coming, and great preparations were made for hisreception. After he had started on his return, he was taken ill on thetrain, and was left at a small town called Jackson, where he soon died.I drove the family to the depot upon the day of his expected arrival,and as the train came in, the women waved their handkerchiefs; and, whenthe conductor stepped off, they asked him if Mr. McGee was aboard. Hesaid no--"I have his remains." The scene that followed, I can notdescribe--such wailing and screaming! I could not but feel sad, eventhough they had treated me so meanly, causing the death of my children,and separating me from my wife. Their grief was indeed great. The sadnews was conveyed to his mother, old Mrs. Jack McGee, at the house by anadvance messenger, and we soon followed with the body. He was thefavorite son of his mother, and her grief was very great. But for hiswanton shooting of the Union officer, he would probably not have met hisdeath as he did.       *       *       *       *       *UNION SOLDIERS PASS THE PANOLA HOME.One winter night, while I was at old Master Jack's, I was awakened by arumbling noise like that of heavy wagons, which continued steadily andso long a time that I finally concluded it must be an army passing, andsuch I found to be the case, upon getting up and venturing out, therumbling which had awakened me being caused by the passing artillery. Iwas afraid to go out straight to the soldiers, but would take a fewsteps at a time, then stop and listen behind a tree or the shrubbery.All seemed quiet--there was no talking. I had listened about twentyminutes when there seemed to be a halt at the creek, some distance fromthe house. Soon afterwords I heard the command given: "Forward!" I atonce made up my mind that they were Yankee soldiers. I got on my kneesand crawled to the fence, not daring to go openly, fearing that theymight hear or see me and shoot, supposing me to be a spy. I went backinto the house and told my wife that they were Yankees who had justpassed. "Uncle George," said I, "this would be a good time for us togo." "Oh, no," said he, "we are not quite ready." Uncle George's cabinwas where my wife and I stayed while at old Master Jack's. In themorning I was to carry a parcel to Como, a place not far from home, toMr. James McGee, who was in the rebel army. It was not quite daylightwhen I made ready to go on my trip, for I was anxious to find out moreabout the soldiers. Going to the stable and saddling my horse, I mountedand rode out to the big gate leading to the main road, just as day wasdawning. As I dismounted to open the gate, some soldiers were passingand an officer sung out to me, "Hello! which way are you going." I said"to Como, to carry this parcel of clothing to my young master in thewar." "You have a fine horse," said the officer, "I guess I willexchange horses with you." He took my package of clothing and someletters which I had to mail and my horse, leaving me his, which was avery poor animal. I was badly scared at this performance, fearing that Iwould be severely whipped for the loss of the horse and package. Yet howcould I help it? We knew nothing but to serve a white man, no matterwhat he asked or commanded. As a matter of course, I did not go to Como,as I had nothing to take--the officer had everything, but went back tothe cabin. I supposed that the soldiers had all passed; but in abouthalf an hour Aunt Kitty, on looking out of her cabin window, exclaimed:"My God! just look at the soldiers!" The yard was covered with the bluecoats. Another venerable slave said: "My Lord! de year of jubilee amcome." During the excitement I ran to the big house, and told the madamthat the Yankees were there, and had taken my horse and every thing Ihad. Old Master Jack had heard the news, but was not able to come out.He had arisen, but, when he knew of the presence of the Yankees, he wentback to bed, calling for Kitty to get him a mush poultice. "TellKitty-ity-ity to get me a mush poultice-oltice." It was customary, afterthe beginning of the war, for him to take sick, and call for a poulticeto be put upon his stomach whenever he heard of the Yankees being near.He and many like him were especially valorous only when the blue coatswere far away. The soldiers went into the dairy and drank all the milk,helped themselves to butter, cheese, meat, bread and everything in sightwhich they wanted. Nothing was said to them by the white folks, but theslaves were glad, and whispered to each other: "Ah! we's goin' to befree." Old Master Jack, lying on his couch would ask every little while:"Where are they? Are they gone?" After they had all left the premises,he said; "My God! I can't stand it. Them devils-evils are just goin'through the country destroyin' everything." I was sent down to get UnclePeter for old master, and when Peter came up the old man asked: "Well,did any of the servants go away? And, sir, them devils took Louis' horseand the clothes he had for his young master."       *       *       *       *       *HIDING VALUABLES FROM THE YANKEES.Right after this the McGees commenced planning to put away theirvaluables, to keep them from the Union soldiers. All the servants had tofill up their bed-ticks with fine gin cotton--the lint part--for safekeeping. Great boxes and barrels were packed full of their best things,and put into the cellar, under the house. It was not exactly a cellar,but a large shallow excavation, which held a great deal. We put all thesolid silver ware, such as cake baskets, trays, spoons, forks, dishes,etc., in boxes, and buried them under the hen house. Great packages ofthe finest clothing I had to make up, and these were given in charge ofcertain servants whose duty it was to run into the big house and getthem, whenever they heard that the Yankees were coming, and take them totheir cabins. This was a shrewd arrangement, for the soldiers never wentinto the cabins to get anything. When the soldiers had passed, thesepackages were taken back to the house. It speaks well for the honestyand faithfulness of the slaves that such trusts could be devolved uponthem, notwithstanding all the cruelties inflicted upon them by theirmasters.       *       *       *       *       *DEATH TO RUNAWAY SLAVES.It was about this time, that the law or regulation of the rebelgovernment was promulgated, authorizing or directing the shooting orhanging of any slave caught trying to get away to the Union army. Thisbarbarous law was carried out in many cases, for every little while wewould hear of some slave who was caught running away, and hung or shot.A slave belonging to Boss, ran away, and got safely within the Unionlines; but he returned to get his sister. They both got away from thehouse, but had gone only a few miles, when William McGee overtook them,and shot the man dead. William boasted of this, but told Uncle Peter,the foreman, that he never wanted it mentioned.       *       *       *       *       *SLAVES HUNG AND LEFT TO ROT AS A WARNING.Two slaves belonging to one Wallace, one of our nearest neighbors, hadtried to escape to the Union soldiers, but were caught, brought back andhung. All of our servants were called up, told every detail of therunaway and capture of the poor creatures and their shocking murder, andthen compelled to go and see them where they hung. I never shall forgetthe horror of the scene--it was sickening. The bodies hung at theroadside, where the execution took place, until the blue flies literallyswarmed around them, and the stench was fearful. This barbarousspectacle was for the purpose of showing the passing slaves what wouldbe the fate of those caught in the attempt to escape, and to secure thecirculation of the details of the awful affair among them, throughoutall the neighborhood. It is difficult at this day for those not familiarwith the atrocities of the institution of slavery to believe that suchscenes could ever have been witnessed in this or any other civilizedland, as a result simply of a human being's effort to reach a portion ofthe country, where the freedom of which it was said to be the home,could be enjoyed without molestation. Yet such was the horrible truth innot one case alone, but in many, as I know only too well.       *       *       *       *       *RUNAWAY SLAVE CAUGHT AND WHIPPED.One day while I was waiting at dinner, some of the children from theslave quarters came running into the house, and said to old Master Jack:"Uncle John is going away--he is down to the creek." He had been put inthe carpenter shop, fastened in the stocks, but by some means he hadgotten the stocks off his feet, and got loose. All in the houseimmediately got up and ran out. Old master told me to run and catch therunaway. I did not like to do it, but had to obey. Old master and I ranin pursuit, and soon overtook him. He could not run, as the stocks werestill on his arms and neck. We brought him back, and he was "stakedout"--that is, four stakes were driven into the ground, the arms tied totwo and the legs to the other two. He was then paddled with the whippingpaddle upon the bottom of his feet, by old Master Jack, until bloodblisters arose, when he took his knife and opened them. I was then sentfor salt and water, and the bruises of the suffering chattel were washedas usual in the stinging brine.       *       *       *       *       *A HOME GUARD ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTS HIMSELF.After the capture of Memphis by the Union forces, the soldiers were inthe habit of making raids into the surrounding country. These were asource of alarm and anxiety among the people, and they were constantlyon the watch to defend their property and themselves, as best theycould. One day Dr. Charles Dandridge went over to one of our neighbors,Mr. Bobor's, to practice shooting, and to see if he had heard anythingnew about the war. It was the custom of the home-guards to meet weekly,and practice with their fire-arms, in order to be the better prepared,as they pretended, for any sudden incursion of the now dreaded Yankee.Mr. Bobor had gotten a Yankee pistol from some friend, who was in thearmy, and Dr. Charles wanted to see and try it. It was shown him, andits workings explained. He took it and began shooting, and in showingthe other men how quickly he could shoot a Yankee, and mount his horse,he accidentally shot himself under the short rib near his heart, andfell to the ground. All the men came running to him, picked him up andcarried him into the house, immediately sending word to Mrs. Dandridgeand Master Jack McGee, his father-in-law. The boys came hurrying in, andtold us what had happened. I hitched up and drove Boss over to Mr.Bobor's. We found the wounded man rapidly sinking; and when, a littlelater, his wife came, he could not speak--only clasped her hand. He diedthat night, and we carried his body to the home, which so short a timebefore, he had left in health and high spirits. No casket was to behad--everything of that kind had been consumed or shut out by the war.Accordingly two slaves were ordered to make a coffin, which they did,using plain boards. It was then covered with black alpaca from a dressof the madam, and lined with the cloth from Mrs. Dandridge's operacloak. The regular material used for these purposes was not to be had.By the time the coffin was ready, the body was so bloated, that it couldnot be got into it. Resort was then had to a plain box, and in this thebody of another of the stricken family group was laid away. At thesuggestion of old Master Jack, the coffin, was put up in the carriagehouse, for safe keeping, he saying it would do for him to be buried in.Sorrow had come to this family with such crushing force, that theirformer pride and boastful spirit had given place to utter dejection.       *       *       *       *       *SUBSTITUTES FOR COFFEE.During the war everything was scarce and dear, and substitutes weredevised for many of those things which had formerly been regarded as thenecessaries of life. Sweet potatoes were peeled, then cut in smallpieces and put out in the sun to dry. They were then used as asubstitute for coffee, when that article became so scarce, toward theclose of the war. Great quantities of this preparation were used. Okrawas another substitute for coffee. It was dried in the pod, then theseeds shelled out, and these were dried again and prepared something asthe coffee is. This made a delicious drink when served with cream, beingvery rich and pleasant to the taste. Quinine was a medicine that hadbeen of almost universal use in the south; yet it became so scarce thatit was sold at seven dollars a bottle, and could not often be had atthat price. Lemon leaves were used as a substitute in cases of chillsand fever. The leaves were made into a tea, and given to the patienthot, to produce perspiration. During an attack of chills, I was treatedin this manner to some advantage. At any rate I got well, which can notalways be said of all methods of treatment.CHAPTER IV.REBELLION WEAKENING--SLAVES' HOPES STRENGTHENING.       *       *       *       *       *M'GEES SLAVES TAKEN TO ALABAMA.While I was absent on my last runaway trip, the Yankees had made a raidthrough Panola; and our people had become greatly frightened. As soon asthey had got back with me and my fellow runaways, they assembled a gangof slaves for the purpose of taking them to Atlanta, Ga., to get themout of the reach of the Union soldiers. Among the slaves selected forthe transfer were myself, my wife Matilda, and the seamstress. Theothers all belonged to Dr. Dandridge and Blanton McGee. Both the Drs.Dandridge went with us to Atlanta. We traveled across the country untilwe came to Demopolis, Alabama, where we found Boss camped on the bank ofthe Tombigbee river with all the farm slaves from Bolivar county. Thiswas the first time I had seen Boss since he was captured and taken toHelena. As my wife and I were the only ones in the gang who belonged toBoss, we left those with whom we had come and joined his gang. We allthen went aboard a boat and were taken to the salt works, situated onthe Tombigbee, ninety miles from Mobile. These salt works belonged tothe rebel government. The first president of the works was Mr. Woolsey,of Salem, Alabama. During Mr. Woolsey's term, the first part of 1864,when we had been there some time, he wrote to Boss asking if he wouldsell myself and wife, and offering 3,000 for both of us. Boss wasindignant at this and curtly refused. My wife acted as cook at the saltworks, in the headquarters for the president, managers and clerks. Mr.Woolsey was delighted with her cooking; her bread and rolls, he said,could not be surpassed.       *       *       *       *       *M'GEE'S GREAT SCHEME.When the election of officers of the works came off in the fall, Mr.Gallatin McGee was chosen president. Boss then hired us all, about 100in number, to labor in these works, but he, of course, received all therevenue. The work assigned me was that of butler at headquarters, and mywife was cook. Both women and children, as well as men, were employed inthese works. After some months labor here, soon after Gallatin McGeebecame president, Matilda and I were removed to the Montgomeryheadquarters, where we remained until nearly Christmas. A few daysbefore that time, Boss came to Montgomery and arranged for us to meethim in Mobile. We started at the appointed time, reached the city in themorning, and I went directly to the hotel where he told me he would be.I found him at once, and he informed me all about his plans for thefuture, and what he expected to accomplish. He had purchased an islandin the bay, a little way from Mobile, where he had decided to establishsalt works of his own. All the brick and lumber for the buildings hadbeen carried there, and work upon them was to be commenced immediatelyafter Christmas. He intended to make a home for the family on theisland; and, as soon as he could complete the works, to remove all hishands from the government works to his own. He was very enthusiasticover this scheme, claiming that he would make far more money by it thanhe was then receiving from hiring out his slaves. He told me that hewould remain in Mobile two or three days and would go to Panola to spendthe holidays, after which he intended to bring all the family to Mobile,and remain there until the island was in readiness to be occupied.There was to be a general break up of the old home, and the beginning ofa new manner of life. I stayed in his room at the hotel all theforenoon, listening to his plans; then I went back where my wife wasstopping. As I left his room, he said: "Lou," as he always called me, "Iwill see you and Matilda at the boat this evening." We went to the boatat the appointed time and saw the Boss, but he did not come near us. Asthe boat was about to put off, I looked and saw him walking up and downthe levee, apparently much excited, running his hands nervously throughhis hair--a habit common to him when he was worried. He seemed greatlydistressed. The military situation troubled him, for the Union army hadconquered nearly everything; and the fact now stared him in the facethat he would soon lose his slaves. He never dreamed in the beginning ofthe war that the Unionists would conquer, and that the slaves would befreed; but now he saw that not only all his wealth in the bodies andsouls of men was slipping away from him, but that much, if not all ofthe gain which these chattels had brought him was likely to "take wingsand fly away."       *       *       *       *       *M'GEE'S DEATH.We returned to the salt works the morning after leaving Mobile. Bossremained two days in Mobile, and then started for Panola, the home ofhis father-in-law; but, on his way, he was taken sick, having contracteda heavy cold which ran into pneumonia, and he lasted only a short time,dying on New Year's day. He had taken cold in bringing the slaves fromBolivar over the river on barges. The river was overflowed about fiftymiles out, and the only way he could get the slaves across was by usinglarge barges made of logs. They were several days floating down in thisway, before he could get out to the railroad at Jackson, Miss., where hetransferred them to the cars. This was too much of an exposure and itkilled him.After Boss died all the plans were changed. Col. Hunting, son-in-law ofold Master Jack, came down to the salt works and hired us all out therefor another year. This was the beginning of the year 1865. Of master'splans concerning the island and his proposed salt works the family knewlittle, for they questioned me close as to what he told me of thematter. What he spent on the island in lumber, brick, etc., was lost, asthey knew nothing of the particulars of the expenditure. The madamremained at her fathers, and the slaves at the works.       *       *       *       *       *I MAKE SOME MONEY.As I was here for another year, acting as butler, I thought I would tryand see if I could not make some money for myself. I asked Mr. Brooks,the manager of the works, if he could get me some tobacco by sending toMobile for it. He said he could; and on the fourth day thereafter, inthe evening, it came. I was anxious to get it the same evening, but Mr.Brooks said: "Oh! I guess you had better wait until morning, then whenyou finish your work come down to the office and get it--you will thenhave more time to see the boys in the works." In the morning I was upearly, and after doing my morning work I was off to Brooks' office. WhenI went in he said: "There it is under the table." The package was sosmall I felt disappointed--a hundred dollars worth ought to be more,said I to myself; but I took it, and went out among the men. I thought Iwould try to sell it at five dollars a plug, and if I could not sell itat that I would take four dollars. I must make something, for I hadborrowed the money to buy it with; and I saw that to clear anything onit, I must at least get four dollars a plug. The money which I hadborrowed was from three fellow servants, who had been fortunate inearning some little time and had saved their money. The first man I metin the works bought two plugs, at five dollars each; and after I hadbeen there about an hour all was sold. So I went back with a lightheart. Mr. Brooks said to me at dinner: "Well, how did you get alongwith your tobacco?" "I did very well," I said, "the only trouble was Idid not have enough. I sold it for 180." "Well," said he, "if you did,you made more clear money than the works here. How much a plug did yousell it for?" at the same time drawing out his pencil and commencing tofigure it up. "I had thirty-six plugs," said I, "and I sold them forfive dollars a plug." Nothing more was said just then, but after dinnerBrooks and two of the clerks went out on the veranda to smoke. When theywere in a good way smoking, Brooks slipped into the dining room, andsaid: "Well, that was fine; you got five dollars a plug for thetobacco?" "Oh, yes!" I said, "tobacco is scarce, and they were hungryfor it; it went like hot cakes--the price was not questioned, I sold atonce." "What is the prospect for selling more?" he asked. "Will you sellit for half the profit if I furnish the tobacco?" I said "yes." So hesent the same day for a box of tobacco--about five hundred plugs. Whenthe tobacco came the box was sawed in two and one-half sent up to myroom. I put some fellows out as agents to sell for me--Uncle Hudson, whotook care of the horses and mules at the works; John at the hospital;William, head chopper, among the 100 men in the woods. Each brought infrom 40.00 to 50.00 every two or three days, and took another supply.Sometimes, when I had finished my work in the afternoon, I would get anold pony and go around through the neighborhood and sell four or fiveplugs. It was a mystery to the servants how I got the tobacco; but I didnot let on that Brooks was backing me. In two weeks we had taken in1,600.00, and I was happy as I could be. Brooks was a fine fellow--anortherner by birth, and did just what he said he would. I receivedone-half of the money. Of course this was all rebel money, but I wassharp, and bought up all the silver I could find. Just as we got on theother half of the box, Brooks received word that the Yankees werecoming, and to send all the hands to their masters. I was glad that Ihad made some money, knowing that I would need it if I gained myfreedom, which I now knew was quite probable, as the Union forces weregaining ground everywhere. But the message ended my money-making, and Iprepared to go home to Panola.       *       *       *       *       *GOING BACK TO PANOLA.Mr. Brooks fixed the return papers so that my wife and I could leave theparty of slaves at Demopolis, and go on thence to Panola by rail, toconvey the news to madam that all hands were coming home; that theYankees were expected to capture the salt works within a short time. AtJackson, some seven miles from the salt works, we were delayed overnight by reason of lack of facilities for crossing the Tombigbee river.The report that the Yankees were coming through had created a panicamong the white people; and hundreds, fleeing from their homes, hadgathered at the river, waiting and clamoring for an opportunity tocross. Though slaves were property, and valuable on that account, thewhites seemed to think that their own lives were in danger, and to beprotected first. They therefore took precedence of us. In the morningabout seven o'clock a steamer was seen coming at a distance; but itcould not be discovered at once just what the character of it was. Thewhites became alarmed. Some said: "The Yankees are coming." Other said:"It is a gun boat--they will surely fire on us." But as the boat drewnear the people saw that there was nothing to fear--it was only theregular passenger boat. Besides the hundreds of people, there werescores of wagons, filled with household goods to go over, and thepassage was slow and tedious. We finally got across and traveled as faras Demopolis, where Matilda and I left the other slaves, and took atrain and went on to Panola. I delivered the papers to the madam fromBrooks, which told her all the particulars concerning the break up atthe salt works. She sent wagons right away after the other slaves whowere coming back on foot. They were not brought back to Panola; but werehired out to different farmers along the road home--some in Jackson,some in Granda and others in Panola town. These were all small towns inMississippi. My wife and I went to work at old Master Jack's, I on thefarm and my wife at her old duties in the house. We longed for freedom,but were content for the time with hoping and praying for the coming ofthe day when it should be realized. It was sad to see the changes thathad come to the white folks. Sorrow had left its impress upon all and wefelt it, notwithstanding all that we had suffered at their hands. Bosshad willed the homestead in Memphis to Mrs. Farrington, and she wasgetting ready to take possession. He had borrowed a great amount ofmoney from her when he bought the island at Mobile; and the rapid comingon of the end of the rebellion destroyed all prospect of the success ofhis salt works scheme, even before his death, and really rendered himbankrupt. Hence the transfer of the Memphis property to her was the onlyway he could make good what he owed her. The madam now had no home, butwas compelled to stay with her father, old Master Jack. She was sadlychanged--did not appear like the same person. Her troubles and sorrowshad crushed her former cruel and haughty spirit. Her mother had died afew months before, and then her husband had followed, dying suddenly andaway from home. Then much of her property had been lost, and socialpleasures and distinction were gone forever. Who shall say that thewrongs done her poor, helpless slaves were not avenged in this life? Thelast I knew of her she was still at her father's.       *       *       *       *       *INCIDENTS.A servant who belonged to Dr. Dandridge ran away and got to Memphis justafter it was captured by the Union soldiers. He was put into the armyand was stationed at one of the entrances to the city. He was to haltall persons passing to or from the city, no difference who they were,and learn their names and their business. Young William McGee and hissister, Miss Cherry, one day went up to Memphis and, to their surprise,were halted by this former servant of their uncle. When they came homethey were speaking of it to their father, and old Master Jack said: "Andyou halted, did you?" "Why, yes," replied William, "we had to do it.""Well," said the old man, "I would have died-died before I would havedone it. To think that a servant should have halted you, and one who hasbelonged to the family like Anderson!" This old man, notwithstanding allhis boasting in the absence of immediate danger, was the veriest cowardwhen danger was present; and if he had been in the place of youngWilliam, he would have halted with the greatest alacrity.While at the salt works I had a little experience at nursing. A fellowslave was taken ill, and I was called on to care for him at night. Ialways liked this work; it was a pleasure to me to be in the sick room.Typhoid fever was a new case to me, but I remembered what instructionsBoss had given me about it. I "pitched in" to do what I could; but thefever was so great he lasted only a few days.       *       *       *       *       *MY FIFTH STRIKE FOR FREEDOM IS A SUCCESS.We had remained at old Jack's until June, 1865, and had tried to becontent. The Union soldiers were still raiding all through that section.Every day some town would be taken, and the slaves would secretlyrejoice. After we came back from Alabama we were held with a tighterrein than ever. We were not allowed to go outside of the premises.George Washington, a fellow servant, and Kitty, his wife, and I hadtalked considerably about the Yankees, and how we might get away. Weknew it was our right to be free, for the proclamation had long beenissued--yet they still held us. I did not talk much to my wife aboutgoing away, as she was always so afraid I would be killed, and did notwant me to try any more to escape. But George, his wife and I continuedto discuss the matter, whenever we had a chance. We knew that Memphiswas headquarters for the Union troops, but how to reach it was thegreat question.It was Sunday, and I had driven one portion of the family to church, andGeorge the other. The family was now very large, as the madam and herfamily were there, in addition to Old Master Jack's, and all could notgo in one carriage. On the way back, young William McGee came up throughthe farm, on horseback, a nearer way home from church, and encounteredseveral servants belonging to some of the neighbors. He asked them whatthey were doing there, and if they had passes. To this last question allanswered no. "Well," said he, "never come here again without havingpasses, all of you." At this they all quickly disappeared. When Old Jackcame home, Will told him what had passed; and he immediately called forGeorge and Uncle Peter, the foreman, and told them that no one notbelonging there was to come into the quarters without a pass; and anyservant with a pass should be brought to the house, that the pass mightbe inspected. They thought, or feared, that if the servants werepermitted to come together freely they might plan ways of escape, andcommunicate to each other what they knew about the war and the Yankees.George came out, and finding me, told me what they had said. "No slavefrom outside is to be allowed on the place," said he. I replied: "If welisten to them we shall be here until Christmas comes again." "What doyou mean?" asked George. "I mean that now, today, is the time to make astart." So, late in the afternoon, during the servants' prayer meeting,of which I have heretofore spoken, we thought would be a good time toget away, as no one would be likely to see us. We talked with JohnSmith, another servant, and told him all about our plan, asking him notto say a word about our being gone until he was through feeding thestock. This would give us another hour to advance on our journey, as thefeeding usually took about that time--from six o'clock until seven. Ourfear was that we might be overtaken by the bloodhounds; and, therefore,we wished to get as far away as possible before the white people knew wewere gone. It was Sunday afternoon, June 26th, 1865, when George and I,having made ready for the start for the Union lines, went to bid ourwives good-bye. I told my wife to cheer up, as I was coming again to gether. I said to Kitty, George's wife: "We are going, but look for usagain. It will not be with us as with so many others, who have goneaway, leaving their families and never returning for them. We will behere again." She looked up at me, smiling, and with a look ofresolution, said: "I'll be ready." She was of a firm, daring nature--Idid not fear to tell her all my plans. As my wife was so timid, I saidas little as possible to her. George and I hurriedly said our farewellsto our wives. The parting was heartrending, for we knew the dangers weregreat, and the chances were almost even that we should not meet again. Icould hardly leave my wife, her agitation and grief were so great. Butwe were off in a few moments. We crept through the orchard, passingthrough farm after farm until we struck the railroad, about seven milesfrom home. We followed this road until we reached Senatobia, about halfpast seven in the evening. We felt good, and, stopping all night, westarted the next morning for Hernando, Miss., another small town, andreached there at two o'clock in the afternoon. The most of the bridgeshad been burned, by the troops, and there were no regular railroadtrains. Fortunately, however, flat cars, drawn by horses were run overthe road; and on a train of this kind we took passage. On severaloccasions, the passengers had to get out, and push the car over abridge, as it was not made so horses could cross on it, the horsesmeantime being driven or led through the stream, and then hitched to thecar again. After we had gone through this process repeatedly, we at lastreached Memphis, arriving about seven o'clock Monday evening. The citywas filled with slaves, from all over the south, who cheered and gave usa welcome. I could scarcely recognize Memphis, things were so changed.We met numbers of our fellow servants who had run away before us, whenthe war began. Tuesday and Wednesday we spent in making inquiries; and Ivisited our old home at McGee's station. But how different it was fromwhat it had been when the McGees were there. All was changed. Thursdaywe went to see Col. Walker, a Union officer, who looked after thecolored folks, and saw that they had their rights. When we reached hisoffice we found it so filled with people, waiting to see him, that wewere delayed about two hours, before we had an opportunity of speakingwith him. When our turn came, we went in, and told him that we werecitizens of Memphis until the fall of Fort Pillow and Donelson, whenour master had run us off, with a hundred other slaves, intoMississippi, and thence to the salt works in Alabama. He questioned usas to where we lived in Memphis. I answered: "What is now headquartersof the Union forces was the home of master, Mr. Edmund McGee, who is nowdead." After a few minutes, I said: "Colonel, we want protection to goback to Mississippi after our wives, who are still held as slaves." Hereplied: "You are both free men to go and come as you please." "Why,"said I, "Colonel, if we go back to Mississippi they will shoot thegizzards out of us." "Well," said he, "I can not grant your request. Iwould be overrun with similar applications; but I will tell you what youcan do. There are hundreds of just such men as you want, who would beglad of such a scout." We thanked him and left.       *       *       *       *       *GOING BACK FOR OUR WIVES.After carefully considering the matter, we concluded to go back toSenatobia and see the captain of the Union troops there. The next day,Friday, we hired a two horse wagon, and made preparations to start onour perilous undertaking Saturday morning. It was our hope to find someone at Senatobia to go with us to Panola, and protect us in the effortto bring away our wives. So, early in the morning, we set out. Ourfirst stop was at Big Springs camping ground, where we made preparationsfor refreshing ourselves and spending the night. Just as we had finishedbuilding a fire, for cooking and keeping off the mosquitoes, twosoldiers came riding up to the spring. "Hello," said one, "which way areyou traveling?" "We are just from Memphis," said George. "Have you anywhisky?" asked one of them. We replied "yes." "Will you give a fellow ahorn?" We answered the question by handing them the bottle. While theywere drinking, George and I stepped aside, and, after a few momentstalk, we decided to put the question to them of going with us to get ourwives. I asked: "Where are you from?" "Senatobia," replied one. We atonce laid our cause before them, telling them what Col. Walker had saidregarding our getting some one to go with us on our enterprise. Theylistened attentively, and when we had finished, one of them asked: "Howmuch whisky have you?" George answered: "Two bottles." "What do youintend to do when you see the captain at Senatobia?" "Lay our complaintbefore him," said I. "Now my friend," said one of the soldiers, "I amafraid if you go to the captain you will be defeated. But I'll tell youwhat I'll do. Give my comrade and me one of your bottles of whisky, andwe will put you on a straight track. The reason why I say this is thatour captain has been sweetened by the rebel farmers. He is invited outto tea by them every evening. I know he will put you off. But I willwrite a note to some comrades of mine who, I know, will bring you outsafe." We agreed at once to this proposition, and gave them the whisky.He wrote the note, and gave it to us, telling us to go to the last tenton the line in the camp, where we would find two boys to whom we shouldgive it. "They are brave," said he, "and the only two I know of that canhelp you. If they are not there don't give the note to any one else, butwait till they come back, on Tuesday night. I feel satisfied that theywill go and help you out." With these words, they rode off. George and Ifelt good over our prospects.       *       *       *       *       *A HAZARDOUS TRIP.The next morning was Sunday, and we started on, reaching Senatobia abouteleven o'clock. We went into the camp, following the directions givenus, to go to the last tent in the line; but, when we reached there, thesoldiers were out. We lingered around the grounds a short time, thenwent back, and found them there. We gave them the note; and, afterreading it, they simply asked us where we had stopped our wagon. I toldthem outside the village. "Go there," said one of them, "and remainuntil we come out to see you." Shortly they came out; and, after we hadtold them what we wanted, the distance to McGee's, which was aboutnineteen miles from Senatobia, and had given them such other informationas they desired, they concluded that they would go. "We want to beback," said I, "before daylight Monday morning, because we must not beseen on the road; for we are well known in that section, and, ifdiscovered, would be captured and killed." "Well," said one of thesoldiers, "we will have to go back to camp, and arrange to be excusedfrom roll call this evening, before we can make the trip." They wentback to camp; and, in about ten minutes they came out again saying: "Allis right; we will go." We gave them each ten dollars; and promised, ifthey brought us out safely, to give each ten dollars more. It was nowabout half-past eleven o'clock. They had to go to camp, and slip theirhorses out cautiously, so as not to be seen by the captain. In half anhour we were on our way; and, after we had ridden some two miles, wewere overtaken by the two soldiers. It was Sunday afternoon; and ourhaving a wagon attracted much attention from the farmers as we passedalong. They looked at us so sharply that George and I felt decidedlyuneasy; yet we kept up courage and pressed steadily on. After a long andweary ride we reached old Master Jack's a little after sundown. Thesoldiers rode into the yard ahead of us, and the first person they metwas a servant (Frank) at the woodpile. They said to him: "Go in and tellyour master, Mr. McGee, to come out, we want to see him," at the sametime asking for Louis' and George's wives. Young William McGee came outand the soldiers said to him: "We want feed for seventy-five head ofhorses." McGee said: "We have not got it." Just then George and I werecoming up. We drove in at the gate, through the grove, and passed thewoodpile where McGee and the soldiers were talking. McGee had justreplied: "We have not got that much feed to spare--we are almost out.""Well," said the soldiers, "we must have it," and they followed on rightafter the wagons. As we drove past them, young McGee went running intothe house, saying to his mother: "It is Louis and George, and I'll killone of them to-night." This raised quite an alarm, and the members ofthe family told him not to do that, as it would ruin them. As soon asGeorge and I drove up to the first cabin, which was my wife's andKitty's, we ran in. Kitty met us at the door and said: "I am all ready."She was looking for us. We commenced loading our wagon with our fewthings. Meanwhile the soldiers had ridden around a few rods and cameupon old Master Jack and the minister of the parish, who were watchingas guards to keep the slaves from running away to the Yankees. Justthink of the outrage upon those poor creatures in forcibly retainingthem in slavery long after the proclamation making them free had goneinto effect beyond all question! As the soldiers rode up to the two menthey said: "Hello! what are you doing here? Why have you not told thesetwo men, Louis and George, that they are free men--that they can go andcome as they like?" By this time all the family were aroused, and greatexcitement prevailed. The soldier's presence drew all the servants near.George and I hurried to fill up our wagon, telling our wives to get in,as there was no time to lose--we must go at once. In twenty minutes wewere all loaded. My wife, Aunt Kitty and nine other servants followedthe wagon. I waited for a few moments for Mary Ellen, sister of my wife;and as she came running out of the white folks' house, she said to hermistress, Mrs. Farrington: "Good-bye; I wish you good luck." "I wish youall the bad luck," said she in a rage. But Mary did not stop to noticeher mistress further; and joining me, we were soon on the road followingthe wagon.       *       *       *       *       *TWO BRAVE MEN.Those soldiers were brave indeed. Think of the courage and daringinvolved in this scheme--only two soldiers going into a country of whichthey knew nothing except that every white man living in it was theirenemy. The demand which they made for food for seventy-five horses was aclever ruse, invented by them to alarm the McGees, and make them thinkthat there was a troop of horses near by, and that it would not be safefor them to offer any resistance to our going away with our wives. Hadthey thought that there were but two soldiers, it is certain that theywould have endeavored to prevent us getting away again, and one or moreof us would undoubtedly have been killed.As already stated, nine other slaves followed our wagon, as it movedoff. They had no hats on; some were bare-footed,--they had not stoppedto get anything; but, as soon as they saw a chance to get away, theywent just as they were at the moment. Aunt Kitty was brave andforethoughtful, for during the week we were gone she had baked andcooked a large amount of substantial food that would keep us fromstarving while on our journey.At the first road crossing, the two soldiers thought they saw a largetroop of soldiers in the distance, and they galloped ahead of us at fullspeed; but, on arriving at the spot, they found that what they hadthought soldiers were only a herd of cattle. They rode on to the nextcrossing, we following as we conveniently could. Each poor slave wasbusy with his thoughts and his prayers. Now and then one would hear amoan or a word from some of the party. All were scared, even though thesoldiers were with us. We came to the next cross road, and passed thatsafely. Our fear was that the McGees might get the neighborhood to jointhem and pursue us, or send the home guards after us; but Providencewas seemingly smiling upon us at last, for no one followed or molestedus. We moved on all night, until we came to a creek, at four o'clock inthe morning of Monday. The banks of the creek were very steep, and asthe horses and wagon went down into the stream, the mattress on top ofthe wagon, upon which my wife and her sister's children were sitting,was thrown off into the water. Immediately the horses stopped, andbecame balky. It was such a warm night that they did not want to move onout of the water, and would not start, either, until they got ready. Assoon as the soldiers saw the mattress slide off with my wife and thechildren, one of them plunged into the water with his horse, and, in aminute, brought them all out. All had a good ducking--indeed it seemedlike a baptism by immersion. The drenched ones were wrapped in oldblankets; and, after an hour's delay, we were again on our way. Thesoldiers said: "Now we must leave you; the time is coming when we mustbe in camp for roll call. If you are not at our camp when roll call isover, we will come back and see about you." We gave them each the secondten dollars, as agreed upon, and just as they rode to the top of thehill they left us. We had a clear sweep from this point, and we cameinto Senatobia about nine o'clock in the forenoon. Our two soldierfriends, who had brought us out so safely, came out of camp to see us.They cheered us, and seemed glad that they had rendered us service. Westopped at the camp until we had dried our clothes and had somebreakfast; and, then, we made our way to Memphis.       *       *       *       *       *OUT OF BONDAGE AT LAST.My wife and her sister were shoeless, and the latter had no hat on--shehad hurried out of the house in such excitement that she thought ofnothing but getting away. Having to walk some of the way, as all couldnot ride in the wagon at the same time, we were all tired, dirty andrest-broken, and, on the whole, a pitiful crowd to look at, as we cameinto the city. One venerable old man, bent with age, whose ebony faceshone with delight, came running out into the road as we appeared,exclaiming: "Oh! here dey come, God bless 'em! Poor chil'en! they comefannin." We used large palm leaves to fan ourselves with, as we were sowarm. Those nine souls that followed us walked the whole distance,arriving shortly after we did. Thousands of others, in search of thefreedom of which they had so long dreamed, flocked into the city ofrefuge, some having walked hundreds of miles.It was appropriately the 4th of July when we arrived; and, aside fromthe citizens of Memphis, hundreds of colored refugees thronged thestreets. Everywhere you looked you could see soldiers. Such a day Idon't believe Memphis will ever see again--when so large and so motley acrowd will come together. Our two soldier rescuers looked us up after wewere in Memphis, and seemed truly glad that we had attained our freedom,and that they had been instrumental in it. Only one thing we regret, andthat is that we did not learn their names; but we were in so muchtrouble, and so absorbed in the business which we had in hand--soexcited by the perils of our undertaking, that we never thought to askthem their names, or to what regiment they belonged. Then, after we gotto Memphis, though we were most grateful for the service which they hadrendered us, we were still so excited by our new condition andsurroundings that we thought of little else, and forgot that we had nomeans of establishing, at a later time, the identity of those to whomwe owed so much. Freedom, that we had so long looked for, had come atlast; and we gave praise to God, blessing the day when we met those twoheroes. It is true that we should have been free, sooner or later;still, but for their assistance, my wife and I might never have metagain. If I could not have gone back, which I could never have donealone, until long after, such changes might have occurred as would haveseparated us for years, if not forever. Thousands were separated in thismanner--men escaping to the Union lines, hoping to make a way to returnfor their families; but, failing in this, and not daring to returnalone, never saw their wives or children more. Thanks to God, we wereguided to these brave soldiers, and so escaped from so cruel a fate.       *       *       *       *       *A WORD FOR MY OLD MASTER.In closing this account of my years of bondage, it is, perhaps, butjustice to say of my old master that he was in some respects kinder andmore humane than many other slaveholders. He fed well, and all hadenough to wear, such as it was. It is true that the material was coarse,but it was suited to the season, and, therefore, comfortable, whichcould not truthfully be said of the clothing of the slaves of otherplanters. Not a few of these did not have sufficient clothes to keepthem warm in winter; nor did they have sufficient nourishing andwholesome food. But while my master showed these virtues, similar tothose which a provident farmer would show in the care of his dumbbrutes, he lacked in that humane feeling which should have kept him frombuying and selling human beings and parting kindred--which should havemade it impossible for him to have permitted the lashing, beating andlacerating of his slaves, much more the hiring of an irresponsiblebrute, by the year, to perform this barbarous service for him. TheMcGees were charitable--as they interpreted the word--were always readyto contribute to educational and missionary funds, while denying, underthe severest penalties, all education to those most needing it, and alltrue missionary effort--the spiritual enlightenment for which they werefamishing. Then our masters lacked that fervent charity, the love ofChrist in the heart, which if they had possessed they could not havetreated us as they did. They would have remembered the golden rule: "Dounto others as ye would that men should do to you." Possessing absolutepower over the bodies and souls of their slaves, and grown rich fromtheir unrequited toil, they became possessed by the demon of avarice andpride, and lost sight of the most vital of the Christly qualities.CHAPTER V.FREEDOM AFTER SLAVERY.       *       *       *       *       *COMING NORTH.As before stated, we arrived in Memphis on the Fourth of July, 1865. Myfirst effort as a freeman was to get something to do to sustain myselfand wife and a babe of a few months, that was born at the salt works. Isucceeded in getting a room for us, and went to work the second daydriving a public carriage. I made enough to keep us and pay our roomrent. By our economy we managed to get on very well. I worked on, hopingto go further north, feeling somehow that it would be better for usthere; when, one day I ran across a man who knew my wife's mother. Hesaid to me: "Why, your wife's mother went back up the river toCincinnati. I knew her well and the people to whom she belonged." Thisinformation made us eager to take steps to find her. My wife wasnaturally anxious to follow the clue thus obtained, in hopes of findingher mother, whom she had not seen since the separation at Memphis yearsbefore. We, therefore, concluded to go as far as Cincinnati, at anyrate, and endeavor to get some further information of mother. My wifeseemed to gather new strength in learning this news of her mother,meager though it was. After a stay in Memphis of six weeks we went on toCincinnati, hopeful of meeting some, at least, of the family that,though free, in defiance of justice, had been consigned to cruel andhopeless bondage--bondage in violation of civil as well as moral law. Wefelt it was almost impossible that we should see any one that we everknew; but the man had spoken so earnestly and positively regarding mymother-in-law that we were not without hope. On arriving at Cincinnati,our first inquiry was about her, my wife giving her name anddescription; and, fortunately, we came upon a colored man who said heknew of a woman answering to the name and description which my wife gaveof her mother, and he directed us to the house where she was stopping.When we reached the place to which we had been directed, my wife notonly found her mother but one of her sisters. The meeting was a joyfulone to us all. No mortal who has not experienced it can imagine thefeeling of those who meet again after long years of enforced separationand hardship and utter ignorance of one another's condition and place ofhabitation. I questioned them as to when and where they had met, and howit happened that they were now together. My mother-in-law then began thefollowing narrative:"When I was sold from the Memphis trader's yard I was bought by a manwho lived not far from Memphis. I never heard of any of the children,and knew nothing as to what had become of them. After the capture ofMemphis by the Union army, the people to whom I belonged fled from theirhome, leaving their slaves; and the other slaveholders of theneighborhood did the same. The slaves, left to themselves, at oncedeparted for Memphis, and I among the number. When I had been there buta short time a call was made for nurses to go into the hospital; and,after thinking of it for a few minutes, I concluded to answer the call,and was speedily installed in the work. When I had been there a shorttime I found, to my great surprise and delight, my eldest daughter wasalso employed there. She had come to Memphis as I had, because hermaster's family had fled; and, hearing the call for nurses, had enteredthe service at once. I can not tell my pleasure in meeting one of mychildren, for I had never expected to see any of them again. Wecontinued our work in the hospital until Generals Sheridan and Grantsaid the city was getting too crowded with colored people--there was notroom for them; some must be removed. So, large numbers of them were sentto Cincinnati, and my daughter and I were among them. This is why yousee us here together."When she had finished telling this story my wife and I were sheddingtears of joy. My sister-in-law, Mary Ellen, whom Boss bought at the sametime that he bought my wife, was with us; thus the mother and threedaughters had met again most unexpectedly, and in a way almostmiraculous. This meeting again of mother and daughters, after years ofseparation and many vicissitudes, was an occasion of the profoundestjoy, although all were almost wholly destitute of the necessaries oflife. This first evening we spent together can never be forgotten. I cansee the old woman now, with bowed form and gray locks, as she gavethanks in joyful tones yet reverent manner, for such a wonderfulblessing.       *       *       *       *       *IN CANADA.We did not remain long in Cincinnati, as houses were so scarce we couldnot get a place to stop in. My wife's mother had but one room, and wecould not stay there. We went on to Hamilton, but stayed there only twomonths. I worked at whatever I could get to do--whitewashing and oddjobs of any kind. The women managed to get washing to do, so that we goton very well. Our aim was when we left Memphis to get to Canada, as weregarded that as the safest place for refugees from slavery. We did notknow what might come again for our injury. So, now, as we had found someof my wife's people, we were more eager to go; and, as I could not getany steady work in Hamilton, we made ready to move on. We went straightto Detroit, and crossed over the river to Windsor, Canada, arrivingthere on Christmas 1865. I succeeded in getting work as a porter at theIron House, a hotel situated near the landing. Here my wife also wasemployed, and here we remained until spring; when, as the wages were sosmall in Windsor, I went over to Detroit to seek for more profitableemployment. After some effort, I succeeded in securing a situation, aswaiter, in the Biddle House, and remained there two years, when themanager died, and it changed hands; and, much as I disliked to make achange in my work, I found it necessary. An opportunity soon offered ofa position as sailor on the steamer Saginaw, which ran from Green Bay toEscanaba, in connection with the railroad.       *       *       *       *       *A CLEW TO MY BROTHER WILLIAM.While I was on this boat, one of the men who worked with me said to me,one day: "Have you a brother, Hughes?" I said, "Yes, but I don't knowanything about him. We were sold from each other when boys." "Well,"said he, "I used to sail with a man whose name was Billy Hughes, and helooked just like you." I told him there were three boys of us; that wewere sold to different parties, and that I had never seen either of mybrothers since. One brother was named William, but went by the nicknameof Billy. "Has this man had his forefinger cut off," asked I. "Oh!"replied he, "I don't know, Hughes, about that." "Well," said I, "this isall I remember about Billy. I accidentally chopped off his forefingerone day, when we were small boys in Virginia. This is the only thing bywhich I could identify my brother William." Nothing more was said uponthe matter, and it dropped out of my mind. I did not realize howimportant were the words of this man. It never occurred to me that heheld the clew that might bring us together again.       *       *       *       *       *WORK IN CHICAGO.When the sailing season had ended, the steamer tied up at Chicago forthe winter. Upon going ashore, I at once tried to get something else todo, for I could not afford to be idle a day. One of the first men I metin Chicago was my old friend and fellow-servant Thomas Bland. He wasglad to see me, and told me all about his escape to Canada, and how hehad met Will McGee, at Niagara Falls. He was working at the ShermanHouse, having charge of the coat room. I told him that I had beensailing during the summer, but that the boat was now laid up, and that Iwas anxious for another job. He said he would try and see what he coulddo for me. He went to the proprietor of the hotel, Mr. Rice; and, to mysurprise and delight, he was so fortunate as to secure me a position asporter and general utility man. My family were still at Windsor, Canada;and, when I had secured this place, I got leave of absence to make thema visit, and went there at once. Two babies had been born only a daybefore my arrival. I had hoped to be there on the interesting occasion,but was too late. However, I was pleased to find two bright little girlsto aid in the family greeting, which was delightful after the months ofseparation. My wife, her sister Mary and her two children, her motherand the sister we found at Cincinnati were all still here livingtogether.       *       *       *       *       *ATTENDING NIGHT SCHOOL.After a visit of two weeks with my family, I returned to Chicago, andbegan my work at the Sherman House. I was full of energy and hope, andresolved to put forth every effort to make a man of myself, and to earnan honest living. I saw that I needed education, and it was one of thebitterest remembrances of my servitude that I had been cheated out ofthis inalienable right--this immeasurable blessing. I, therefore,determined to do what was in my power to gain something of that of whichI had been cruelly defrauded. Hence I entered the night-school forfreedmen, which had been established in the city, and faithfullyattended its sessions during the months it was kept open.       *       *       *       *       *I SETTLE IN MILWAUKEE.I worked at the Sherman House until August 1868, and, during this time,saw many travelers and business men, and made some lasting friends amongthem. Among these was Mr. Plankinton. He seemed to take a fancy to me,and offered me a situation in the Plankinton House, soon to be opened inMilwaukee. I readily accepted it for I was not getting a large salary,and the position which he offered promised more. The Plankinton Housewas opened in September, and I was placed in full charge of the coatroom; and, after I had been there some time, I had, in connection withmy coat room duties, charge of the bell stand. My wife had charge of thewaiter's rooms, a lodging house situated on Second street, one door fromGrand Avenue. This was a brick building that stood where the westportion of the Plankinton now stands. The second floor was used as ourliving rooms; the third and fourth floors constituted the sleepingapartments of the hotel waiters. My wife looked after these apartments,saw that they were clean, and had a general supervision of them.       *       *       *       *       *BEGIN BUSINESS FOR MYSELF IN A SMALL WAY.After the hotel had been running a little over a year, I saw there wasa chance for me to make something at laundry work. I was allowed to takewashing from any of the guests who desired their work done privately. Inthis way I worked up quite a business. I still continued my coat roomduties, as my wife managed the laundry work. Our laundry businessincreased so rapidly I deemed it best to change our quarters from Secondstreet to 216 Grand avenue, which seemed better suited for our purpose.Here the business continued to grow until it reached proportions ofwhich we had little idea when we began it.       *       *       *       *       *MEETING RELATIVES OF MY OLD MASTER.One day while I was at the Plankinton I happened to be coming throughthe hall, when whom should I meet but Col. Hunting, son-in-law of oldMaster Jack McGee, of Mississippi. We came face to face, and I knew himat once, but he only partially recognized me. He said: "I know yourface, but can not recall your name." I said: "Don't you know LouisMcGee?" He then remembered me at once. "Why," said he, "my wife, mybrother and all his family are here. There is a party of us on apleasure trip through the north." I soon learned that they had visitedat Waukesha springs, and had been at the hotel only a few hours, waitingfor the boat for Grand Haven. I hastened to bring my wife to see themand got back with her just in time. They were already in the 'bus, butwaited for us. We very cordially shook hands with them. They asked mewhy I had come so far north, and I replied that we kept traveling untilwe found a place where we could make a good living. They wished ussuccess and the 'bus rolled away.       *       *       *       *       *FINDING MY BROTHER WILLIAM.While I was at the Plankinton House many of the traveling men seeminglyliked to talk with me when they came to the coat room to check theirthings. I remember one day when conversing with one of these gentlemen,he asked, all of a sudden: "Say, Hughes, have you a brother?" Ianswered: "Yes, I had two, but I think they are dead. I was sold fromthem when a mere lad." "Well," said he, "if you have a brother he is inCleveland. There is a fellow there who is chief cook at the Forest CityHotel who looks just like you." I grew eager at these words, and put thesame question to him that I did to the man on the steamer when I wassailing: "Has he one fore-finger cut off?" He laughed and answered:"Well, I don't know, Hughes, about that; but I do know this: His nameis Billy and he resembles you very much. I'll tell you what I'll do,when I go back to Cleveland on my next trip I'll look and see if thatfore-finger is off." Now that the second person had called my attentionto the fact that there was a man in Cleveland who looked very much likeme, I became deeply interested--in fact, I was so excited I could hardlydo my work. I awaited the agents return with what of patience I couldcommand; and, at last, one day, when I was least expecting him, I wasgreeted with these words: "Hello, Hughes! I have good news for you." Igrew so excited I could hardly stand still. "Well," he said, "you toldme that you had a brother whose name was William, but called Billy forshort?" "Yes," I said. "Did your brother Billy have his fore-fingerchopped off by his brother Louis, when, as boys, they were one dayplaying together?" "Yes," I replied. "Then I have found your brother,"he said. "I have seen the man in Cleveland, and he corroborates yourstory in every particular. He says that he was born in Virginia, nearCharlottesville, and was owned by one John Martin." I knew now, beyondquestion, that this was my brother William. Words failed me to expressmy feelings at this news. The prospect of seeing my brother, lost somany years before, made me almost wild with joy. I thanked the agent forthe interest he had taken in me, and for the invaluable andcomprehensive information he had brought. He could hardly have done me agreater favor, or bound me to him by a more lasting obligation.My first step was to arrange for a leave of absence from my work, whichI found no difficulty in accomplishing, and by night I was aboard theexpress going to Cleveland. My excitement did not diminish as I sped onmy journey, and the speed of the express was too slow for my eageranticipations. Upon reaching Cleveland I went directly to the hotelwhere I was told my brother was employed, and inquired at the office forBilly Hughes. A bell boy was summoned to take me around to thedepartment where he was. When we met neither of us spoke for somemoments--speech is not for such occasions, but silence rather, and therush of thoughts. When the first flash of feeling had passed I spoke,calling him by name, and he addressed me as brother. There seemed to beno doubt on either side as to our true relationship, though thefeatures of each had long since faded forever from the memory of theother. He took me to his house; and each of us related his story withsuch feelings as few can fully appreciate. He told me that he had neverheard anything of our mother or brother. He went back to the old home inVirginia, after the close of the rebellion, but could get no trace ofher.As we related our varied experiences--the hardships, the wrongs andsorrows which we endured and at last the coming of brighter days, wewere sad, then happy. It seemed, and indeed was, wonderful that weshould have met again after so long a separation. The time allotted tomy visit with him passed most pleasantly, and all too quickly; and, as Ilooked into the faces of his wife and children, I seemed to have entereda new and broader life, and one in which the joys of social intercoursehad marvelously expanded. When I came to saying good-bye to him, soclose did I feel to him, the tie between us seemed never to have beenbroken. That week, so full of new experiences and emotions can never beerased from my memory. After many promises of the maintenance of thesocial relations thus renewed, we parted, to take up again the burdensof life, but with new inspiration and deeper feeling.I came back to my work with renewed vigor, and I could not but rejoiceand give praise to God for the blessings that I had experienced in theyears since my bondage, and especially for this partial restoration ofthe broken tie of kindred. I had long since learned to love Christ, andmy faith in him was so firmly established that I gave him praise foreach and every ray of happiness that came into my life.       *       *       *       *       *GROWTH OF THE LAUNDRY BUSINESS.I continued the laundry work, in connection with that at the hotel,until 1874. I had been in the Plankinton House then six years and ahalf. The laundry business had increased to such an extent that my wifecould not manage it all alone. I, therefore, gave up my position at thehotel, and went into the laundry work on a somewhat larger scale thanthat upon which we had been conducting it. We were still doing businessat 216 Grand avenue, and there we remained until 1876; when we removedto more commodious quarters at 713 on the avenue. But we remained thereonly a few mouths, when we removed to 134 Fourth street in the rear. Theestablishment here was fitted up with all modern appliances; but I wasnot so successful as I anticipated. My losses were heavy; and thoughthe facilities for doing the work were much better than those which wehad before possessed, the location was not so accessible or inviting.We, therefore, went back to our former location at 713 on the avenue.       *       *       *       *       *EMPLOYED AS A NURSE.Not long after this, Dr. Douglas, a prominent physician of the city atthat time, was in failing health, and, wishing a nurse, I wasrecommended to him for this service by a friend. I served the doctor inthis capacity every night for three months. I then went with him toMcComb, a village in southern Mississippi, which had been, in the daysof slavery, a somewhat famous resort, but which had lost its prestige,and entered upon a general decline; the hotel and all its surroundingspresenting the appearance of general dilapidation. I remained here withthe doctor for two weeks--until they succeeded in getting another personto care for him. I then took a run down to New Orleans.       *       *       *       *       *A TRIP SOUTH.On this southern trip I had the opportunity of observing the conditionof the country through which we passed. Many of the farms seemedneglected, the houses dilapidated, or abandoned, the fields eitheruncultivated and overgrown with bushes, or the crops struggling withgrass and weeds for the mastery, and presenting but little promise of apaying harvest. In some places the bushes and other undergrowth werefifteen feet high, and the landscape was peculiar and by no meansinviting. I could remember the appearance of the cotton farms in slaverydays; but how changed were things I now saw! They did not look at alllike those which I had been accustomed to see. Everything was dismal anduninviting. The entire country passed through in Mississippi looked likea wilderness. This deterioration was the natural result of thedevastating war which had swept the country, and to the industrialrevolution which followed and to which affairs had not been adjusted.When I arrived at New Orleans I found the levee filled with fruit.Oranges and bananas were piled in masses like coal, and the scenes inthis portion of the city were very different from anything one sees inthe north. Among the many places of interest in the city were thecemeteries. Owing to the low level of the ground and its saturation withwater, burials are seldom made in graves, but instead in tombs built ofbrick or marble or other stone, in which are constructed cells runningback from the front and of a size and shape sufficient to admit acoffin. Then, as soon as filled, they are sealed up. These tombs containfrom two to six or eight, or even more of these cells, and their generalappearance from the front is not unlike that of a section of mail boxesin a postoffice. Other places of interest were the old French market,the public squares and gardens, the old Catholic churches, and some ofthe relics of slavery days in the shape of pens where slaves wereexposed for sale. One of these was in the basement of the Hotel Royal,which would contain several hundred at once, and from which hundredswent to a bondage bitterer than death, and from which death was the onlyrelief.       *       *       *       *       *I MAKE NURSING MY REGULAR BUSINESS.I came back to Milwaukee with a new idea. I liked nursing--it was mychoice from childhood. Even though I had been deprived of a course oftraining, I felt that I was not too old to try, at least, to learn theart, or to add to what I already knew. Dr. Douglas gave me a splendidrecommendation, and had some cards printed, bearing my name and address.These I distributed, and thus began the business which I have followedsteadily since that time. Dr. Marks very kindly recommended me to wellknown men needing the service of a nurse, and to his professionalassociates; and through this means, and through his continued kindnessand interest, I have been almost constantly engaged in this work. I amalso indebted to Drs. Fox and Spearman and other prominent physiciansfor recommendations which have resulted in securing me employment whichhas proved remunerative to me, and which seemed to give entiresatisfaction to the sick and their friends. This is no small part of thecompensation in the difficult, often wearing, and always delicate dutiesof the nurse in the sick room. To every true man or woman it is one ofthe greatest satisfactions to have the consciousness of having beenuseful to his fellow beings. My duties as nurse have taken me todifferent parts of the state, to Chicago, to California and to Florida;and I have thus gained no little experience, not only in my business,but in many other directions.I have endeavored, in the foregoing sketch, to give a clear and correctidea of the institution of human slavery, as I witnessed and experiencedit--its brutality, its degrading influence upon both master and slave,and its utter incompatibility with industrial improvement and generaleducational progress. Nothing has been exaggerated or set down inmalice, although in the scars which I still bear upon my person, and inthe wounds of spirit which will never wholly heal, there might be founda seeming excuse for such a course. Whatever of kindness was shown meduring the years of my bondage, I still gratefully remember, whether itcame from white master or fellow slave; and for the recognition whichhas been so generously accorded me since the badge of servitude wasremoved, I am profoundly and devoutly thankful.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THIRTY YEARS A SLAVE********** This file should be named 10431.txt or 10431.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/4/3/10431Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.

DE BALZACIl se trouve dans certaines provinces des maisons dont la vue inspireune melancolie egale a celle que provoquent les cloitres les plussombres, les landes les plus ternes ou les ruines les plus tristes.Peut-etre y a-t-il a la fois dans ces maisons et le silence du cloitreet l'aridite des landes et les ossements des ruines. La vie et lemouvement y sont si tranquilles qu'un etranger les croirait inhabitees,s'il ne rencontrait tout a coup le regard pale et froid d'une personneimmobile dont la figure a demi monastique depasse l'appui de la croisee,au bruit d'un pas inconnu. Ces principes de melancolie existent dans laphysionomie d'un logis situe a Saumur, au bout de la rue montueuse quimene au chateau, par le haut de la ville. Cette rue, maintenant peufrequentee, chaude en ete, froide en hiver, obscure en quelquesendroits, est remarquable par la sonorite de son petit pave caillouteux,toujours propre et sec, par l'etroitesse de sa voie tortueuse, par lapaix de ses maisons qui appartiennent a la vieille ville, et quedominent les remparts. Des habitations trois fois seculaires y sontencore solides quoique construites en bois, et leurs divers aspectscontribuent a l'originalite qui recommande cette partie de Saumur al'attention des antiquaires et des artistes. Il est difficile de passerdevant ces maisons, sans admirer les enormes madriers dont les boutssont tailles en figures bizarres et qui couronnent d'un bas-relief noirle rez-de-chaussee de la plupart d'entre elles. Ici, des pieces de boistransversales sont couvertes en ardoises et dessinent des lignes bleuessur les freles murailles d'un logis termine par un toit en colombage queles ans ont fait plier, dont les bardeaux pourris ont ete tordus parl'action alternative de la pluie et du soleil. La se presentent desappuis de fenetre uses, noircis, dont les delicates sculptures se voienta peine, et qui semblent trop legers pour le pot d'argile brune d'ous'elancent les oeillets ou les rosiers d'une pauvre ouvriere. Plus loin,c'est des portes garnies de clous enormes ou le genie de nos ancetres atrace des hieroglyphes domestiques dont le sens ne se retrouvera jamais.Tantot un protestant y a signe sa foi, tantot un ligueur y a mauditHenri IV. Quelque bourgeois y a grave les insignes de sa _noblesse decloches_, la gloire de son echevinage oublie. L'Histoire de France estla tout entiere. A cote de la tremblante maison a pans hourdes oul'artisan a deifie son rabot, s'eleve l'hotel d'un gentilhomme ou sur leplein-cintre de la porte en pierre se voient encore quelques vestiges deses armes, brisees par les diverses revolutions qui depuis 1789 ontagite le pays. Dans cette rue, les rez-de-chaussee commercants ne sontni des boutiques ni des magasins, les amis du moyen-age y retrouveraientl'ouvrouere de nos peres en toute sa naive simplicite. Ces sallesbasses, qui n'ont ni devanture, ni montre, ni vitrages, sont profondes,obscures et sans ornements exterieurs ou interieurs, Leur porte estouverte en deux parties pleines, grossierement ferrees, dont lasuperieure se replie interieurement, et dont l'inferieure armee d'unesonnette a ressort va et vient constamment. L'air et le jour arrivent acette espece d'antre humide, ou par le haut de la porte, ou par l'espacequi se trouve entre la voute, le plancher et le petit mur a hauteurd'appui dans lequel s'encastrent de solides volets, otes le matin, remiset maintenus le soir avec des bandes de fer boulonnees. Ce mur sert aetaler les marchandises du negociant. La, nul charlatanisme. Suivant lanature du commerce, les echantillons consistent en deux ou trois baquetspleins de sel et de morue, en quelques paquets de toile a voile, descordages, du laiton pendu aux solives du plancher, des cercles le longdes murs, ou quelques pieces de drap sur des rayons. Entrez? Une fillepropre, pimpante de jeunesse, au blanc fichu, aux bras rouges quitte sontricot, appelle son pere ou sa mere qui vient et vous vend a vossouhaits, flegmatiquement, complaisamment, arrogamment, selon soncaractere, soit pour deux sous, soit pour vingt mille francs demarchandise. Vous verrez un marchand de merrain assis a sa porte et quitourne ses pouces en causant avec un voisin, il ne possede en apparenceque de mauvaises planches a bouteilles et deux ou trois paquets delattes; mais sur le port son chantier plein fournit tous les tonneliersde l'Anjou; il sait, a une planche pres, combien il _peut_ de tonneauxsi la recolte est bonne; un coup de soleil l'enrichit, un temps depluie le ruine: en une seule matinee, les poincons valent onze francsou tombent a six livres. Dans ce pays, comme en Touraine, lesvicissitudes de l'atmosphere dominent la vie commerciale. Vignerons,proprietaires, marchands de bois, tonneliers, aubergistes, marinierssont tous a l'affut d'un rayon de soleil; ils tremblent en se couchantle soir d'apprendre le lendemain matin qu'il a gele pendant la nuit;ils redoutent la pluie, le vent, la secheresse, et veulent de l'eau, duchaud, des nuages, a leur fantaisie. Il y a un duel constant entre leciel et les interets terrestres. Le barometre attriste, deride, egaietour a tour les physionomies. D'un bout a l'autre de cette rue,l'ancienne Grand'rue de Saumur, ces mots: Voila un temps d'or! sechiffrent de porte en porte. Aussi chacun repond-il au voisin: Il pleutdes louis, en sachant ce qu'un rayon de soleil, ce qu'une pluieopportune lui en apporte. Le samedi, vers midi, dans la belle saison,vous n'obtiendriez pas pour un sou de marchandise chez ces bravesindustriels. Chacun a sa vigne, sa closerie, et va passer deux jours ala campagne. La, tout etant prevu, l'achat, la vente, le profit, lescommercants se trouvent avoir dix heures sur douze a employer enjoyeuses parties, en observations, commentaires, espionnages continuels.Une menagere n'achete pas une perdrix sans que les voisins ne demandentau mari si elle etait cuite a point. Une jeune fille ne met pas la tetea sa fenetre sans y etre vue par tous les groupes inoccupes. La donc lesconsciences sont a jour, de meme que ces maisons impenetrables, noireset silencieuses n'ont point de mysteres. La vie est presque toujours enplein air: chaque menage s'assied a sa porte, y dejeune, y dine, s'ydispute. Il ne passe personne dans la rue qui ne soit etudie. Aussi,jadis, quand un etranger arrivait dans une ville de province, etait-ilgausse de porte en porte. De la les bons contes, de la le surnom de_copieux_ donne aux habitants d'Angers qui excellaient a ces railleriesurbaines. Les anciens hotels de la vieille ville sont situes en haut decette rue jadis habitee par les gentilshommes du pays. La maison pleinede melancolie ou se sont accomplis les evenements de cette histoireetait precisement un de ces logis, restes venerables d'un siecle ou leschoses et les hommes avaient ce caractere de simplicite que les moeursfrancaises perdent de jour en jour. Apres avoir suivi les detours de cechemin pittoresque dont les moindres accidents reveillent des souvenirset dont l'effet general tend a plonger dans une sorte de reveriemachinale, vous apercevez un renfoncement assez sombre, au centre duquelest cachee la porte de la maison a monsieur Grandet. Il est impossiblede comprendre la valeur de cette expression provinciale sans donner labiographie de monsieur Grandet.Monsieur Grandet jouissait a Saumur d'une reputation dont les causes etles effets ne seront pas entierement compris par les personnes qui n'ontpoint, peu ou prou, vecu en province. Monsieur Grandet, encore nomme parcertaines gens le pere Grandet, mais le nombre de ces vieillardsdiminuait sensiblement, etait en 1789 un maitre-tonnelier fort a sonaise, sachant lire, ecrire et compter. Des que la Republique francaisemit en vente, dans l'arrondissement de Saumur, les biens du clerge, letonnelier, alors age de quarante ans, venait d'epouser la fille d'unriche marchand de planches. Grandet alla, muni de sa fortune liquide etde la dot, muni de deux mille louis d'or, au district, ou, moyennantdeux cents doubles louis offerts par son beau-pere au faroucherepublicain qui surveillait la vente des domaines nationaux, il eut pourun morceau de pain, legalement, sinon legitimement, les plus beauxvignobles de l'arrondissement, une vieille abbaye et quelques metairies.Les habitants de Saumur etant peu revolutionnaires, le pere Grandetpassa pour un homme hardi, un republicain, un patriote, pour un espritqui donnait dans les nouvelles idees, tandis que le tonnelier donnaittout bonnement dans les vignes. Il fut nomme membre de l'administrationdu district de Saumur, et son influence pacifique s'y fit sentirpolitiquement et commercialement. Politiquement, il protegea lesci-devant et empecha de tout son pouvoir la vente des biens des emigres;commercialement, il fournit aux armees republicaines un ou deuxmilliers de pieces de vin blanc, et se fit payer en superbes prairiesdependant d'une communaute de femmes que l'on avait reservee pour undernier lot. Sous le Consulat, le bonhomme Grandet devint maire,administra sagement, vendangea mieux encore; sous l'Empire, il futmonsieur Grandet. Napoleon n'aimait pas les republicains: il remplacamonsieur Grandet, qui passait pour avoir porte le bonnet rouge, par ungrand proprietaire, un homme a particule, un futur baron de l'Empire.Monsieur Grandet quitta les honneurs municipaux sans aucun regret. Ilavait fait faire dans l'interet de la ville d'excellents chemins quimenaient a ses proprietes. Sa maison et ses biens, tres avantageusementcadastres, payaient des impots moderes. Depuis le classement de sesdifferents clos, ses vignes, grace a des soins constants, etaientdevenues la tete du pays, mot technique en usage pour indiquer lesvignobles qui produisent la premiere qualite de vin. Il aurait pudemander la croix de la Legion-d'Honneur. Cet evenement eut lieu en1806. Monsieur Grandet avait alors cinquante-sept ans, et sa femmeenviron trente-six. Une fille unique, fruit de leurs legitimes amours,etait agee de dix ans. Monsieur Grandet, que la Providence voulut sansdoute consoler de sa disgrace administrative, herita successivementpendant cette annee de madame de La Gaudiniere, nee de La Bertelliere,mere de madame Grandet; puis du vieux monsieur La Bertelliere, pere dela defunte; et encore de madame Gentillet, grand'mere du cote maternel:trois successions dont l'importance ne fut connue de personne.L'avarice de ces trois vieillards etait si passionnee que depuislongtemps ils entassaient leur argent pour pouvoir le contemplersecretement. Le vieux monsieur La Bertelliere appelait un placement uneprodigalite, trouvant de plus gros interets dans l'aspect de l'or quedans les benefices de l'usure. La ville de Saumur presuma donc la valeurdes economies d'apres les retenus des biens au soleil. Monsieur Grandetobtint alors le nouveau titre de noblesse que notre manie d'egaliten'effacera jamais: il devint _le plus impose_ de l'arrondissement. Ilexploitait cent arpents de vignes, qui, dans les annees plantureuses,lui donnaient sept a huit cents poincons de vin. Il possedait treizemetairies, une vieille abbaye, ou, par economie, il avait mure lescroisees, les ogives, les vitraux, ce qui les conserva; et centvingt-sept arpents de prairies ou croissaient et grossissaient troismille peupliers plantes en 1793. Enfin la maison dans laquelle ildemeurait etait la sienne. Ainsi etablissait-on sa fortune visible,Quant a ses capitaux, deux seules personnes pouvaient vaguement enpresumer l'importance: l'une etait monsieur Cruchot, notaire charge desplacements usuraires de monsieur Grandet; l'autre, monsieur desGrassins, le plus riche banquier de Saumur, aux benefices duquel levigneron participait a sa convenance et secretement. Quoique le vieuxCruchot et monsieur des Grassins possedassent cette profonde discretionqui engendre en province la confiance et la fortune, ils temoignaientpubliquement a monsieur Grandet un si grand respect que les observateurspouvaient mesurer l'etendue des capitaux de l'ancien maire d'apres laportee de l'obsequieuse consideration dont il etait l'objet. Il n'yavait dans Saumur personne qui ne fut persuade que monsieur Grandetn'eut un tresor particulier, une cachette pleine de louis, et ne sedonnat nuitamment les ineffables jouissances que procure la vue d'unegrande masse d'or. Les avaricieux en avaient une sorte de certitude envoyant les yeux du bonhomme, auxquels le metal jaune semblait avoircommunique ses teintes. Le regard d'un homme accoutume a tirer de sescapitaux un interet enorme contracte necessairement, comme celui duvoluptueux, du joueur ou du courtisan, certaines habitudesindefinissables, des mouvements furtifs, avides, mysterieux quin'echappent point a ses coreligionnaires. Ce langage secret forme enquelque sorte la franc-maconnerie des passions. Monsieur Grandetinspirait donc l'estime respectueuse a laquelle avait droit un homme quine devait jamais rien a personne, qui, vieux tonnelier, vieux vigneron,devinait avec la precision d'un astronome quand il fallait fabriquerpour sa recolte mille poincons ou seulement cinq cents; qui ne manquaitpas une seule speculation, avait toujours des tonneaux a vendre alorsque le tonneau valait plus cher que la denree a recueillir, pouvaitmettre sa vendange dans ses celliers et attendre le moment de livrer sonpoincon a deux cents francs quand les petits proprietaires donnaient leleur a cinq louis. Sa fameuse recolte de 1811, sagement serree,lentement vendue, lui avait rapporte plus de deux cent quarante millelivres. Financierement parlant, monsieur Grandet tenait du tigre et duboa: il savait se coucher, se blottir, envisager longtemps sa proie,sauter dessus; puis il ouvrait la gueule de sa bourse, y engloutissaitune charge d'ecus, et se couchait tranquillement, comme le serpent quidigere, impassible, froid, methodique. Personne ne le voyait passer sanseprouver un sentiment d'admiration melange de respect et de terreur.Chacun dans Saumur n'avait-il pas senti le dechirement poli de sesgriffes d'acier? a celui-ci maitre Cruchot avait procure l'argentnecessaire a l'achat d'un domaine, mais a onze pour cent; a celui-lamonsieur des Grassins avait escompte des traites, mais avec uneffroyable prelevement d'interets. Il s'ecoulait peu de jours sans quele nom de monsieur Grandet fut prononce soit au marche, soit pendant lessoirees dans les conversations de la ville. Pour quelques personnes, lafortune du vieux vigneron etait l'objet d'un orgueil patriotique. Aussiplus d'un negociant, plus d'un aubergiste disait-il aux etrangers avecun certain contentement: "Monsieur, nous avons ici deux ou troismaisons millionnaires; mais, quant a monsieur Grandet, il ne connaitpas lui-meme sa fortune!"En 1816 les plus habiles calculateurs deSaumur estimaient les biens territoriaux du bonhomme a pres de quatremillions; mais, comme terme moyen, il avait du tirer par an, depuis1793 jusqu'en 1817, cent mille francs de ses proprietes, il etaitpresumable qu'il possedait en argent une somme presque egale a celle deses biens-fonds. Aussi, lorsqu'apres une partie de boston, on quelqueentretien sur les vignes, on venait a parler de monsieur Grandet, lesgens capables disaient-ils:--Le pere Grandet?... le pere Grandet doit avoir cinq a six millions.--Vous etes plus habile que je ne le suis, je n'ai jamais pu savoir le total, repondaient monsieur Cruchot ou monsieur des Grassins s'ilsentendaient le propos. Quelque Parisien parlait-il des Rotschild ou demonsieur Laffitte, les gens de Saumur demandaient s'ils etaient aussiriches que monsieur Grandet. Si le Parisien leur jetait en souriant unededaigneuse affirmation, ils se regardaient en hochant la tete d'un aird'incredulite. Une si grande fortune couvrait d'un manteau d'or toutesles actions de cet homme. Si d'abord quelques particularites de sa viedonnerent prise au ridicule et a la moquerie, la moquerie et le ridicules'etaient uses. En ses moindres actes, monsieur Grandet avait pour luil'autorite de la chose jugee. Sa parole, son vetement, ses gestes, leclignement de ses yeux faisaient loi dans le pays, ou chacun, apresl'avoir etudie comme un naturaliste etudie les effets de l'instinct chezles animaux, avait pu reconnaitre la profonde et muette sagesse de sesplus legers mouvements.--L'hiver sera rude, disait-on, le pere Grandet a mis ses gants fourres:il faut vendanger.--Le pere Grandet prend beaucoup de merrain, il y aura du vin cetteannee. Monsieur Grandet n'achetait jamais ni viande ni pain. Sesfermiers lui apportaient par semaine une provision suffisante dechapons, de poulets, d'oeufs, de beurre et de ble de rente. Il possedaitun moulin dont le locataire devait, en sus du bail, venir chercher unecertaine quantite de grains et lui en rapporter le son et la farine. Lagrande Nanon, son unique servante, quoiqu'elle ne fut plus jeune,boulangeait elle-meme tous les samedis le pain de la maison. MonsieurGrandet s'etait arrange avec les maraichers, ses locataires, pour qu'ilsle fournissent de legumes. Quant aux fruits, il en recoltait une tellequantite qu'il en faisait vendre une grande partie au marche. Son boisde chauffage etait coupe dans ses haies ou pris dans les vieillestruisses a moitie pourries qu'il enlevait au bord de ses champs, et sesfermiers le lui charroyaient en ville tout debite, le rangeaient parcomplaisance dans son bucher et recevaient ses remerciments. Ses seulesdepenses connues etaient le pain benit, la toilette de sa femme, cellede sa fille, et le payement de leurs chaises a l'eglise; la lumiere,les gages de la grande Nanon, l'etamage de ses casseroles;l'acquittement des impositions, les reparations de ses batiments et lesfrais de ses exploitations. Il avait six cents arpents de bois recemmentachetes qu'il faisait surveiller par le garde d'un voisin, auquel ilpromettait une indemnite. Depuis cette acquisition seulement, ilmangeait du gibier. Les manieres de cet homme etaient fort simples. Ilparlait peu. Generalement il exprimait ses idees par de petites phrasessentencieuses et dites d'une voix douce. Depuis la Revolution, epoque alaquelle il attira les regards, le bonhomme begayait d'une manierefatigante aussitot qu'il avait a discourir longuement ou a soutenir unediscussion. Ce bredouillement, l'incoherence de ses paroles, le flux demots ou il noyait sa pensee, son manque apparent de logique attribues aun defaut d'education etaient affectes et seront suffisamment expliquespar quelques evenements de cette histoire. D'ailleurs, quatre phrasesexactes autant que des formules algebriques lui servaient habituellementa embrasser, a resoudre toutes les difficultes de la vie et du commerce:Je ne sais pas, je ne puis pas, je ne veux pas, nous verrons cela. Ilne disait jamais ni _oui_ ni _non_, et n'ecrivait point. Lui parlait-on?il ecoutait froidement, se tenait le menton dans la main droite enappuyant son coude droit sur le revers de la main gauche, et se formaiten toute affaire des opinions desquelles il ne revenait point. Ilmeditait longuement les moindres marches. Quand, apres une savanteconversation, son adversaire lui avait livre le secret de sespretentions en croyant le tenir, il lui repondait:--Je ne puis rien conclure sans avoir consulte ma femme. Sa femme, qu'ilavait reduite a un ilotisme complet, etait en affaires son paravent leplus commode. Il n'allait jamais chez personne, ne voulait ni recevoirni donner a diner; il ne faisait jamais de bruit, et semblaiteconomiser tout, meme le mouvement. Il ne derangeait rien chez lesautres par un respect constant de la propriete. Neanmoins, malgre ladouceur de sa voix, malgre sa tenue circonspecte, le langage et leshabitudes du tonnelier percaient, surtout quand il etait au logis, ou ilse contraignait moins que partout ailleurs. Au physique, Grandet etaitun homme de cinq pieds, trapu, carre, ayant des mollets de douze poucesde circonference, des rotules noueuses et de larges epaules; son visageetait rond, tanne, marque de petite verole; son menton etait droit, seslevres n'offraient aucunes sinuosites, et ses dents etaient blanches;ses yeux avaient l'expression calme et devoratrice que le peuple accordeau basilic; son front, plein de rides transversales, ne manquait pas deprotuberances significatives; ses cheveux jaunatres et grisonnantsetaient blanc et or, disaient quelques jeunes gens qui ne connaissaientpas la gravite d'une plaisanterie faite sur monsieur Grandet. Son nez,gros par le bout, supportait une loupe veinee que le vulgaire disait,non sans raison, pleine de malice. Cette figure annoncait une finessedangereuse, une probite sans chaleur, l'egoisme d'un homme habitue aconcentrer ses sentiments dans la jouissance de l'avarice et sur le seuletre qui lui fut reellement de quelque chose, sa fille Eugenie, sa seuleheritiere. Attitude, manieres, demarche, tout en lui, d'ailleurs,attestait cette croyance en soi que donne l'habitude d'avoir toujoursreussi dans ses entreprises. Aussi, quoique de moeurs faciles et mollesen apparence, monsieur Grandet avait-il un caractere de bronze. Toujoursvetu de la meme maniere, qui le voyait aujourd'hui le voyait tel qu'iletait depuis 1791. Ses forts souliers se nouaient avec des cordons decuir, il portait en tout temps des bas de laine drapes, une culottecourte de gros drap marron a boucles d'argent, un gilet de velours araies alternativement jaunes et puces, boutonne carrement, un largehabit marron a grands pans, une cravate noire et un chapeau de quaker.Ses gants, aussi solides que ceux des gendarmes, lui duraient vingtmois, et, pour les conserver propres, il les posait sur le bord de sonchapeau a la meme place, par un geste methodique. Saumur ne savait riende plus sur ce personnage.Six habitants seulement avaient le droit de venir dans cette maison. Leplus considerable des trois premiers etait le neveu de monsieur Cruchot.Depuis sa nomination de president au tribunal de premiere instance deSaumur, ce jeune homme avait joint au nom de Cruchot celui de Bonfons,et travaillait a faire prevaloir Bonfons sur Cruchot. Il signait deja C.de Bonfons. Le plaideur assez malavise pour l'appeler monsieur Cruchots'apercevait bientot a l'audience de sa sottise. Le magistrat protegeaitceux qui le nommaient monsieur le president, mais il favorisait de sesplus gracieux sourires les flatteurs qui lui disaient monsieur deBonfons. Monsieur le president etait age de trente-trois ans, possedaitle domaine de Bonfons (_Boni Fontis_), valant sept mille livres de rente;il attendait la succession de son oncle le notaire et celle de sononcle l'abbe Cruchot, dignitaire du chapitre de Saint-Martin de Tours,qui tous deux passaient pour etre assez riches. Ces trois Cruchot,soutenus par bon nombre de cousins, allies a vingt maisons de la ville,formaient un parti, comme jadis a Florence les Medicis; et, comme lesMedicis, les Cruchot avaient leurs Lazzi. Madame des Grassins, mere d'unfils de vingt-trois ans, venait tres assidument faire la partie demadame Grandet, esperant marier son cher Adolphe avec mademoiselleEugenie. Monsieur des Grassins le banquier favorisait vigoureusement lesmanoeuvres de sa femme par de constants services secretement rendus auvieil avare, et arrivait toujours a temps sur le champ de bataille. Cestrois des Grassins avaient egalement leurs adherents, leurs cousins,leurs allies fideles. Du cote des Cruchot, l'abbe, le Talleyrand de lafamille, bien appuye par son frere le notaire, disputait vivement leterrain a la financiere, et tentait de reserver le riche heritage a sonneveu le president. Ce combat secret entre les Cruchot et les desGrassins, dont le prix etait la main d'Eugenie Grandet, occupaitpassionnement les diverses societes de Saumur. Mademoiselle Grandetepousera-t-elle monsieur le president ou monsieur Adolphe des Grassins?A ce probleme, les uns repondaient que monsieur Grandet ne donnerait safille ni a l'un ni a l'autre. L'ancien tonnelier ronge d'ambitioncherchait, disaient-ils, pour gendre quelque pair de France, a qui troiscent mille livres de rente feraient accepter tous les tonneaux passes,presents et futurs des Grandet. D'autres repliquaient que monsieur etmadame des Grassins etaient nobles, puissamment riches, qu'Adolphe etaitun bien gentil cavalier, et qu'a moins d'avoir un neveu du pape dans samanche, une alliance si convenable devait satisfaire des gens de rien,un homme que tout Saumur avait vu la doloire en main, et qui,d'ailleurs, avait porte le bonnet rouge. Les plus senses faisaientobserver que monsieur Cruchot de Bonfons avait ses entrees a toute heureau logis, tandis que son rival n'y etait recu que les dimanches. Ceux-cisoutenaient que madame des Grassins, plus liee avec les femmes de lamaison Grandet que les Cruchot, pouvait leur inculquer certaines ideesqui la feraient, tot ou tard, reussir. Ceux-la repliquaient que l'abbeCruchot etait l'homme le plus insinuant du monde, et que femme contremoine la partie se trouvait egale.--Ils sont manche a manche, disait un bel esprit de Saumur. Plusinstruits, les anciens du pays pretendaient que les Grandet etaient tropavises pour laisser sortir les biens de leur famille, mademoiselleEugenie Grandet de Saumur serait mariee au fils de monsieur Grandet deParis, riche marchand de vin en gros. A cela les Cruchotins et lesGrassinistes repondaient:--D'abord les deux freres ne se sont pas vus deux fois depuis trenteans. Puis, monsieur Grandet de Paris a de hautes pretentions pour sonfils. Il est maire d'un arrondissement, depute, colonel de la gardenationale, juge au tribunal de commerce; il renie Grandet de Saumur, etpretend s'allier a quelque famille ducale par la grace de Napoleon Quene disait-on pas d'une heritiere dont on parlait a vingt lieues a laronde et jusque dans les voitures publiques, d'Angers a Bloisinclusivement? Au commencement de 1818, les Cruchotins remporterent unavantage signale sur les Grassinistes. La terre de Froidfond,remarquable par son parc, son admirable chateau, ses fermes, rivieres,etangs, forets, et valant trois millions, fut mise en vente par le jeunemarquis de Froidfond oblige de realiser ses capitaux. Maitre Cruchot, lepresident Cruchot, l'abbe Cruchot, aides par leurs adherents, surentempecher la vente par petits lots. Le notaire conclut avec le jeunehomme un marche d'or en lui persuadant qu'il y aurait des poursuitessans nombre a diriger contre les adjudicataires avant de rentrer dans leprix des lots; il valait mieux vendre a monsieur Grandet, hommesolvable, et capable d'ailleurs de payer la terre en argent comptant. Lebeau marquisat de Froidfond fut alors convoye vers l'oesophage demonsieur Grandet, qui, au grand etonnement de Saumur, le paya, sousescompte, apres les formalites. Cette affaire eut du retentissement aNantes et a Orleans. Monsieur Grandet alla voir son chateau parl'occasion d'une charrette qui y retournait. Apres avoir jete sur sapropriete le coup d'oeil du maitre, il revint a Saumur, certain d'avoirplace ses fonds a cinq, et saisi de la magnifique pensee d'arrondir lemarquisat de Froidfond en y reunissant tous ses biens. Puis, pourremplir de nouveau son tresor presque vide, il decida de couper a blancses bois, ses forets, et d'exploiter les peupliers de ses prairies.Il est maintenant facile de comprendre toute la valeur de ce mot, lamaison a monsieur Grandet, cette maison pale, froide, silencieuse,situee en haut de la ville, et abritee par les ruines des remparts. Lesdeux piliers et la voute formant la baie de la porte avaient ete, commela maison, construits en tuffeau, pierre blanche particuliere aulittoral de la Loire, et si molle que sa duree moyenne est a peine dedeux cents ans. Les trous inegaux et nombreux que les intemperies duclimat y avaient bizarrement pratiques donnaient au cintre et auxjambages de la baie l'apparence des pierres vermiculees del'architecture francaise et quelque ressemblance avec le porche d'unegeole. Au dessus du cintre regnait un long bas-relief de pierre duresculptee, representant les quatre Saisons, figures deja rongees ettoutes noires. Ce bas-relief etait surmonte d'une plinthe saillante, surlaquelle s'elevaient plusieurs de ces vegetations dues au hasard, desparietaires jaunes, des liserons, des convolvulus, du plantain, et unpetit cerisier assez haut deja. La porte, en chene massif, brune,dessechee, fendue de toutes parts, frele en apparence, etait solidementmaintenue par le systeme de ses boulons qui figuraient des dessinssymetriques. Une grille carree, petite, mais a barreaux serres et rougesde rouille, occupait le milieu de la porte batarde et servait, pourainsi dire, de motif a un marteau qui s'y rattachait par un anneau, etfrappait sur la tete grimacante d'un maitre-clou. Ce marteau, de formeoblongue et du genre de ceux que nos ancetres nommaient Jacquemart,ressemblait a un gros point d'admiration; en l'examinant avecattention, un antiquaire y aurait retrouve quelques indices de la figureessentiellement bouffonne qu'il representait jadis, et qu'un long usageavait effacee. Par la petite grille, destinee a reconnaitre les amis, autemps des guerres civiles, les curieux pouvaient apercevoir, au fondd'une voute obscure et verdatre, quelques marches degradees parlesquelles on montait dans un jardin que bornaient pittoresquement desmurs epais, humides, pleins de suintements et de touffes d'arbustesmalingres. Ces murs etaient ceux du rempart sur lequel s'elevaient lesjardins de quelques maisons voisines. Au rez-de-chaussee de la maison,la piece la plus considerable etait une _salle_ dont l'entree setrouvait sous la voute de la porte cochere. Peu de personnes connaissentl'importance d'une salle dans les petites villes de l'Anjou, de laTouraine et du Berry. La salle est a la fois l'antichambre, le salon, lecabinet, le boudoir, la salle a manger; elle est le theatre de la viedomestique, le foyer commun; la, le coiffeur du quartier venait couperdeux fois l'an les cheveux de monsieur Grandet; la entraient lesfermiers, le cure, le sous-prefet, le garcon meunier. Cette piece, dontles deux croisees donnaient sur la rue, etait plancheiee; des panneauxgris, a moulures antiques, la boisaient de haut en bas; son plafond secomposait de poutres apparentes egalement peintes en gris, dont lesentre-deux etaient remplis de blanc en bourre qui avait jauni. Un vieuxcartel de cuivre incruste d'arabesques en ecaille ornait le manteau dela cheminee en pierre blanche, mal sculpte, sur lequel etait une glaceverdatre dont les cotes, coupes en biseau pour en montrer l'epaisseur,refletaient un filet de lumiere le long d'un trumeau gothique en acierdamasquine. Les deux girandoles de cuivre dore qui decoraient chacun descoins de la cheminee etaient a deux fins, en enlevant les roses qui leurservaient de bobeches, et dont la maitresse-branche s'adaptait aupiedestal de marbre bleuatre agence de vieux cuivre, ce piedestalformait un chandelier pour les petits jours. Les sieges de forme antiqueetaient garnis en tapisseries representant les fables de La Fontaine;mais il fallait le savoir pour en reconnaitre les sujets, tant lescouleurs passees et les figures criblees de reprises se voyaientdifficilement. Aux quatre angles de cette salle se trouvaient desencoignures, especes de buffets termines par de crasseuses etageres. Unevieille table a jouer en marqueterie, dont le dessus faisait echiquier,etait placee dans le tableau qui separait les deux fenetres. Au-dessusde cette table, il y avait un barometre ovale, a bordure noire, enjolivepar des rubans de bois dore, ou les mouches avaient si licencieusementfolatre que la dorure en etait un probleme. Sur la paroi opposee a lacheminee, deux portraits au pastel etaient censes representer l'aieul demadame Grandet, le vieux monsieur de La Bertelliere, en lieutenant desgardes francaises, et defunt madame Gentillet en bergere. Aux deuxfenetres etaient drapes des rideaux en gros de Tours rouge, releves pardes cordons de soie a glands d'eglise. Cette luxueuse decoration, si peuen harmonie avec les habitudes de Grandet, avait ete comprise dansl'achat de la maison, ainsi que le trumeau, le cartel, le meuble entapisserie et les encoignures en bois de rose. Dans la croisee la plusrapprochee de la porte, se trouvait une chaise de paille dont les piedsetaient montes sur des patins, afin d'elever madame Grandet a unehauteur qui lui permit de voir les passants. Une travailleuse en bois demerisier deteint remplissait l'embrasure, et le petit fauteuil d'EugenieGrandet etait place tout aupres. Depuis quinze ans, toutes les journeesde la mere et de la fille s'etaient paisiblement ecoulees a cette place,dans un travail constant, a compter du mois d'avril jusqu'au mois denovembre. Le premier de ce dernier mois elles pouvaient prendre leurstation d'hiver a la cheminee. Ce jour-la seulement Grandet permettaitqu'on allumat du feu dans la salle, et il le faisait eteindre au trenteet un mars, sans avoir egard ni aux premiers froids du printemps ni aceux de l'automne. Une chaufferette, entretenue avec la braise provenantdu feu de la cuisine que la Grande Nanon leur reservait en usantd'adresse, aidait madame et mademoiselle Grandet a passer les matineesou les soirees les plus fraiches des mois d'avril et d'octobre. La mereet la fille entretenaient tout le linge de la maison, et employaient siconsciencieusement leurs journees a ce veritable labeur d'ouvriere, que,si Eugenie voulait broder une collerette a sa mere, elle etait forcee deprendre sur ses heures de sommeil en trompant son pere pour avoir de lalumiere. Depuis longtemps l'avare distribuait la chandelle a sa fille eta la Grande Nanon, de meme qu'il distribuait des le matin le pain et lesdenrees necessaires a la consommation journaliere.La Grande Nanon etait peut-etre la seule creature humaine capabled'accepter le despotisme de son maitre. Toute la ville l'enviait amonsieur et a madame Grandet. La Grande Nanon, ainsi nommee a cause desa taille haute de cinq pieds huit pouces, appartenait a Grandet depuistrente-cinq ans. Quoiqu'elle n'eut que soixante livres de gages, ellepassait pour une des plus riches servantes de Saumur. Ces soixantelivres, accumulees depuis trente-cinq ans, lui avaient permis de placerrecemment quatre mille livres en viager chez maitre Cruchot. Ce resultatdes longues et persistantes economies de la Grande Nanon parutgigantesque. Chaque servante, voyant a la pauvre sexagenaire du painpour ses vieux jours, etait jalouse d'elle sans penser au dur servagepar lequel il avait ete acquis. A l'age de vingt-deux ans, la pauvrefille n'avait pu se placer chez personne, tant sa figure semblaitrepoussante; et certes ce sentiment etait bien injuste: sa figure eutete fort admiree sur les epaules d'un grenadier de la garde; mais entout il faut, dit-on, l'a-propos. Forcee de quitter une ferme incendieeou elle gardait les vaches, elle vint a Saumur, ou elle chercha duservice, animee de ce robuste courage qui ne se refuse a rien. Le pereGrandet pensait alors se marier, et voulait deja monter son menage. Ilavisa cette fille rebutee de porte en porte. Juge de la force corporelleen sa qualite de tonnelier, il devina le parti qu'on pouvait tirer d'unecreature femelle taillee en Hercule, plantee sur ses pieds comme unchene de soixante ans sur ses racines, forte des hanches, carree du dos,ayant des mains de charretier et une probite vigoureuse comme l'etaitson intacte vertu. Ni les verrues qui ornaient ce visage martial, ni leteint de brique, ni les bras nerveux, ni les haillons de la Nanonn'epouvanterent le tonnelier, qui se trouvait encore dans l'age ou lecoeur tressaille. Il vetit alors, chaussa, nourrit la pauvre fille, luidonna des gages, et l'employa sans trop la rudoyer. En se voyant ainsiaccueillie, la Grande Nanon pleura secretement de joie, et s'attachasincerement au tonnelier, qui d'ailleurs l'exploita feodalement. Nanonfaisait tout: elle faisait la cuisine, elle faisait les buees, elleallait laver le linge a la Loire, le rapportait sur ses epaules; ellese levait au jour, se couchait tard; faisait a manger a tous lesvendangeurs pendant les recoltes, surveillait les halleboteurs;defendait, comme un chien fidele, le bien de son maitre; enfin, pleined'une confiance aveugle en lui, elle obeissait sans murmure a sesfantaisies les plus saugrenues. Lors de la fameuse annee de 1811, dontla recolte couta des peines inouies, apres vingt ans de service, Grandetresolut de donner sa vieille montre a Nanon, seul present qu'elle recutjamais de lui. Quoiqu'il lui abandonnat ses vieux souliers (elle pouvaitles mettre), il est impossible de considerer le profit trimestriel dessouliers de Grandet comme un cadeau, tant ils etaient uses. La necessiterendit cette pauvre fille si avare que Grandet avait fini par l'aimercomme on aime un chien, et Nanon s'etait laisse mettre au cou un colliergarni de pointes dont les piqures ne la piquaient plus. Si Grandetcoupait le pain avec un peu trop de parcimonie, elle ne s'en plaignaitpas; elle participait gaiement aux profits hygieniques que procurait leregime severe de la maison ou jamais personne n'etait malade. Puis laNanon faisait partie de la famille: elle riait quand riait Grandet,s'attristait, gelait, se chauffait, travaillait avec lui. Combien dedouces compensations dans cette egalite! Jamais le maitre n'avaitreproche a la servante ni l'halleberge ou la peche de vigne, ni lesprunes ou les brugnons manges sous l'arbre.--Allons, regale-toi, Nanon, lui disait-il dans les annees ou lesbranches pliaient sous les fruits que les fermiers etaient obliges dedonner aux cochons. Pour une fille des champs qui dans sa jeunessen'avait recolte que de mauvais traitements, pour une pauvresserecueillie par charite, le rire equivoque du pere Grandet etait un vrairayon de soleil. D'ailleurs le coeur simple, la tete etroite de Nanon nepouvaient contenir qu'un sentiment et une idee. Depuis trente-cinq ans,elle se voyait toujours arrivant devant le chantier du pere Grandet,pieds nus, en haillons, et entendait toujours le tonnelier lui disant:--Que voulez-vous, ma mignonne? Et sa reconnaissance etait toujoursjeune. Quelquefois Grandet, songeant que cette pauvre creature n'avaitjamais entendu le moindre mot flatteur, qu'elle ignorait tous lessentiments doux que la femme inspire, et pouvait comparaitre un jourdevant Dieu, plus chaste que ne l'etait la Vierge Marie elle-meme;Grandet, saisi de pitie, disait en la regardant:--Cette pauvre Nanon! Son exclamation etait toujours suivie d'un regardindefinissable que lui jetait la vieille servante. Ce mot, dit de tempsa autre, formait depuis longtemps une chaine d'amitie non interrompue,et a laquelle chaque exclamation ajoutait un chainon. Cette pitie,placee au coeur de Grandet et prise tout en gre par la vieille fille,avait je ne sais quoi d'horrible. Cette atroce pitie d'avare, quireveillait mille plaisirs au coeur du vieux tonnelier, etait pour Nanonsa somme de bonheur. Qui ne dira pas aussi: Pauvre Nanon! Dieureconnaitra ses anges aux inflexions de leur voix et a leurs mysterieuxregrets. Il y avait dans Saumur une grande quantite de menages ou lesdomestiques etaient mieux traites, mais ou les maitres n'en recevaientneanmoins aucun contentement. De la cette autre phrase: "Qu'est-ce queles Grandet font donc a leur grande Nanon pour qu'elle leur soit siattachee? Elle passerait dans le feu pour eux!"Sa cuisine, dont lesfenetres grillees donnaient sur la cour, etait toujours propre, nette,froide, veritable cuisine d'avare ou rien ne devait se perdre. QuandNanon avait lave sa vaisselle, serre les restes du diner, eteint sonfeu, elle quittait sa cuisine, separee de la salle par un couloir, etvenait filer du chanvre aupres de ses maitres. Une seule chandellesuffisait a la famille pour la soiree. La servante couchait au fond dece couloir, dans un bouge eclaire par un jour de souffrance. Sa robustesante lui permettait d'habiter impunement cette espece de trou, d'ouelle pouvait entendre le moindre bruit par le silence profond quiregnait nuit et jour dans la maison. Elle devait, comme un dogue chargede la police, ne dormir que d'une oreille et se reposer en veillant.La description des autres portions du logis se trouvera liee auxevenements de cette histoire; mais d'ailleurs le croquis de la salle oueclatait tout le luxe du menage peut faire soupconner par avance lanudite des etages superieurs.En 1819, vers le commencement de la soiree, au milieu du mois denovembre, la grande Nanon alluma du feu pour la premiere fois. L'automneavait ete tres beau. Ce jour etait un jour de fete bien connu desCruchotins et des Grassinistes. Aussi les six antagonistes sepreparaient-ils a venir armes de toutes pieces, pour se rencontrer dansla salle et s'y surpasser en preuves d'amitie. Le matin tout Saumuravait vu madame et mademoiselle Grandet, accompagnees de Nanon, serendant a l'eglise paroissiale pour y entendre la messe, et chacun sesouvint que ce jour etait l'anniversaire de la naissance de mademoiselleEugenie. Aussi, calculant l'heure ou le diner devait finir, maitreCruchot, l'abbe Cruchot et monsieur C. de Bonfons s'empressaient-ilsd'arriver avant les des Grassins peur feter mademoiselle Grandet. Toustrois apportaient d'enormes bouquets cueillis dans leurs petites serres.La queue des fleurs que le president voulait presenter etaitingenieusement enveloppee d'un ruban de satin blanc, orne de frangesd'or. Le matin, monsieur Grandet, suivant sa coutume pour les joursmemorables de la naissance et de la fete d'Eugenie, etait venu lasurprendre au lit, et lui avait solennellement offert son presentpaternel, consistant, depuis treize annees, en une curieuse piece d'or.Madame Grandet donnait ordinairement a sa fille une robe d'hiver oud'ete, selon la circonstance. Ces deux robes, les pieces d'or qu'ellerecoltait au premier jour de l'an et a la fete de son pere, luicomposaient un petit revenu de cent ecus environ, que Grandet aimait alui voir entasser. N'etait-ce pas mettre son argent d'une caisse dansune autre, et, pour ainsi dire, elever a la brochette l'avarice de sonheritiere, a laquelle il demandait parfois compte de son tresor,autrefois grossi par les La Bertelliere, en lui disant:--Ce sera ton _douzain_ de mariage. Le douzain est un antique usageencore en vigueur et saintement conserve dans quelques pays situes aucentre de la France. En Berry, en Anjou, quand une jeune fille se marie,sa famille ou celle de l'epoux doit lui donner une bourse ou setrouvent, suivant les fortunes, douze pieces ou douze douzaines depieces ou douze cents pieces d'argent ou d'or. La plus pauvre desbergeres ne se marierait pas sans son douzain, ne fut-il compose que degros sous. On parle encore a Issoudun de je ne sais quel douzain offerta une riche heritiere et qui contenait cent quarante-quatre portugaisesd'or. Le pape Clement VII, oncle de Catherine de Medicis, lui fitpresent, en la mariant a Henri II, d'une douzaine de medailles d'orantiques de la plus grande valeur. Pendant le diner, le pere, toutjoyeux de voir son Eugenie plus belle dans une robe neuve, s'etait ecrie:--Puisque c'est la fete d'Eugenie, faisons du feu! ce sera de bonaugure.--Mademoiselle se mariera dans l'annee, c'est sur, dit la grande Nanonen remportant les restes d'une oie, ce faisan des tonneliers.--Je ne vois point de partis pour elle a Saumur, repondit madame Grandeten regardant son mari d'un air timide qui, vu son age, annoncaitl'entiere servitude conjugale sous laquelle gemissait la pauvre femme.Grandet contempla sa fille, et s'ecria gaiement:--Elle a vingt-trois ans aujourd'hui, l'enfant, il faudra bientots'occuper d'elle.Eugenie et sa mere se jeterent silencieusement un coup d'oeild'intelligence.Madame Grandet etait une femme seche et maigre, jaune comme un coing,gauche, lente; une de ces femmes qui semblent faites pour etretyrannisees. Elle avait de gros os, un gros nez, un gros front, de grosyeux, et offrait, au premier aspect, une vague ressemblance avec cesfruits cotonneux qui n'ont plus ni saveur ni suc. Ses dents etaientnoires et rares, sa bouche etait ridee, et son menton affectait la formedite en galoche. C'etait une excellente femme, une vraie La Bertelliere.L'abbe Cruchot savait trouver quelques occasions de lui dire qu'ellen'avait pas ete trop mal, et elle le croyait. Une douceur angelique, uneresignation d'insecte tourmente par des enfants, une piete rare, uneinalterable egalite d'ame, un bon coeur, la faisaient universellementplaindre et respecter. Son mari ne lui donnait jamais plus de six francsa la fois pour ses menues depenses. Quoique ridicule en apparence, cettefemme qui, par sa dot et ses successions, avait apporte au pere Grandetplus de trois cent mille francs, s'etait toujours sentie si profondementhumiliee d'une dependance et d'un ilotisme contre lequel la douceur deson ame lui interdisait de se revolter, qu'elle n'avait jamais demandeun sou, ni fait une observation sur les actes que maitre Cruchot luipresentait a signer. Cette fierte sotte et secrete, cette noblesse d'ameconstamment meconnue et blessee par Grandet, dominaient la conduite decette femme. Madame Grandet mettait constamment une robe de levantineverdatre, qu'elle s'etait accoutumee a faire durer pres d'une annee;elle portait un grand fichu de cotonnade blanche, un chapeau de paillecousue, et gardait presque toujours un tablier de taffetas noir. Sortantpeu du logis, elle usait peu de souliers. Enfin elle ne voulait jamaisrien pour elle. Aussi Grandet, saisi parfois d'un remords en serappelant le long temps ecoule depuis le jour ou il avait donne sixfrancs a sa femme, stipulait-il toujours des epingles pour elle envendant ses recoltes de l'annee. Les quatre ou cinq louis offerts par leHollandais ou le Belge acquereur de la vendange Grandet formaient leplus clair des revenus annuels de madame Grandet. Mais, quand elle avaitrecu ses cinq louis, son mari lui disait souvent, comme si leur bourseetait commune:--As-tu quelques sous a me preter? Et la pauvre femme, heureuse depouvoir faire quelque chose pour un homme que son confesseur luirepresentait comme son seigneur et maitre, lui rendait, dans le courantde l'hiver, quelques ecus sur l'argent des epingles. Lorsque Grandettirait de sa poche la piece de cent sous allouee par mois pour lesmenues depenses, le fil, les aiguilles et la toilette de sa fille, il nemanquait jamais, apres avoir boutonne son gousset, de dire a sa femme:--Et toi, la mere, veux-tu quelque chose?--Mon ami, repondait madame Grandet animee par un sentiment de dignitematernelle, nous verrons cela.Sublimite perdue! Grandet se croyait tres genereux envers sa femme. Lesphilosophes qui rencontrent des Nanon, des madame Grandet, des Eugeniene sont-ils pas en droit de trouver que l'ironie est le fond ducaractere de la Providence? Apres ce diner, ou, pour la premiere fois,il fut question du mariage d'Eugenie, Nanon alla chercher une bouteillede cassis dans la chambre de monsieur Grandet, et manqua de tomber endescendant.--Grande bete, lui dit son maitre, est-ce que tu te laisserais choircomme une autre, toi?--Monsieur, c'est cette marche de votre escalier qui ne tient pas.--Elle a raison, dit madame Grandet. Vous auriez du la faire raccommoderdepuis longtemps. Hier, Eugenie a failli s'y fouler le pied.--Tiens, dit Grandet a Nanon en la voyant toute pale, puisque c'est lanaissance d'Eugenie, et que tu as manque de tomber, prends un petitverre de cassis pour te remettre.--Ma foi, je l'ai bien gagne, dit Nanon. A ma place, il y a bien desgens qui auraient casse la bouteille, mais je me serais plutot casse lecoude pour la tenir en l'air.--C'te pauvre Nanon! dit Grandet en lui versant le cassis.--T'es-tu fait mal? lui dit Eugenie en la regardant avec interet.--Non, puisque je me suis retenue en me fichant sur mes reins.--He! bien, puisque c'est la naissance d'Eugenie, dit Grandet, je vaisvous raccommoder votre marche. Vous ne savez pas, vous autres, mettre lepied dans le coin, a l'endroit ou elle est encore solide.Grandet prit la chandelle, laissa sa femme, sa fille et sa servante,sans autre lumiere que celle du foyer qui jetait de vives flammes, etalla dans le fournil chercher des planches, des clous et ses outils.--Faut-il vous aider? lui cria Nanon en l'entendant frapper dansl'escalier.--Non! non! ca me connait, repondit l'ancien tonnelier.Au moment ou Grandet raccommodait lui-meme son escalier vermoulu, etsifflait a tue-tete en souvenir de ses jeunes annees, les trois Cruchotfrapperent a la porte.--C'est-y vous, monsieur Cruchot? demanda Nanon en regardant par lapetite grille.--Oui, repondit le president.Nanon ouvrit la porte, et la lueur du foyer, qui se refletait sous lavoute, permit aux trois Cruchot d'apercevoir l'entree de la salle.--Ah! vous etes des feteux, leur dit Nanon en sentant les fleurs.--Excusez, messieurs, cria Grandet en reconnaissant la voix de ses amis,je suis a vous! Je ne suis pas fier, je rafistole moi-meme une marchede mon escalier.--Faites, faites, monsieur Grandet, _Charbonnier est Maire chez lui_,dit sentencieusement le president en riant tout seul de son allusion quepersonne ne comprit.Madame et mademoiselle Grandet se leverent. Le president, profitant del'obscurite, dit alors a Eugenie:--Me permettez-vous, mademoiselle, de vous souhaiter, aujourd'hui quevous venez de naitre, une suite d'annees heureuses, et la continuationde la sante dont vous jouissez?Il offrit un gros bouquet de fleurs rares a Saumur; puis, serrantl'heritiere par les coudes, il l'embrassa des deux cotes du cou, avecune complaisance qui rendit Eugenie honteuse. Le president, quiressemblait a un grand clou rouille, croyait ainsi faire sa cour.--Ne vous genez pas, dit Grandet en rentrant. Comme vous y allez lesjours de fete, monsieur le president!--Mais, avec mademoiselle, repondit l'abbe Cruchot arme de son bouquet,tous les jours seraient pour mon neveu des jours de fete.L'abbe baisa la main d'Eugenie. Quant a maitre Cruchot, il embrassa lajeune fille tout bonnement sur les deux joues, et dit:--Comme ca nous pousse, ca! Tous les ans douze mois.En replacant la lumiere devant le cartel, Grandet, qui ne quittaitjamais une plaisanterie et la repetait a satiete quand elle lui semblaitdrole, dit:--Puisque c'est la fete d'Eugenie, allumons les flambeaux!Il ota soigneusement les branches des candelabres, mit la bobeche achaque piedestal, prit des mains de Nanon une chandelle neuveentortillee d'un bout de papier, la ficha dans le trou, l'assura,l'alluma, et vint s'asseoir a cote de sa femme, en regardantalternativement ses amis, sa fille et les deux chandelles. L'abbeCruchot, petit homme dodu, grassouillet, a perruque rousse et plate, afigure de vieille femme joueuse, dit en avancant ses pieds bien chaussesdans de forts souliers a agrafes d'argent:--Les des Grassins ne sont pas venus?--Pas encore, dit Grandet.--Mais doivent-ils venir? demanda le vieux notaire en faisant grimacersa face trouee comme une ecumoire.--Je le crois, repondit madame Grandet.--Vos vendanges sont-elles finies? demanda le president de Bonfons aGrandet.--Partout! lui dit le vieux vigneron, en se levant pour se promener delong en long dans la salle et se haussant le thorax par un mouvementplein d'orgueil comme son mot, partout! Par la porte du couloir quiallait a la cuisine, il vit alors la grande Nanon, assise a son feu,ayant une lumiere et se preparant a filer la, pour ne pas se meler a lafete.--Nanon, dit-il, en s'avancant dans le couloir, veux-tu bien eteindreton feu, ta lumiere, et venir avec nous? Pardieu! la salle est assezgrande pour nous tous.--Mais, monsieur, vous aurez du beau monde.--Ne les vaux-tu pas bien? ils sont de la cote d'Adam tout comme toi.Grandet revint vers le president et lui dit:--Avez-vous vendu votre recolte?--Non, ma foi, je la garde. Si maintenant le vin est bon, dans deux ansil sera meilleur. Les proprietaires, vous le savez bien, se sont jure detenir les prix convenus, et cette annee les Belges ne l'emporteront passur nous. S'ils s'en vont, he! bien, ils reviendront.--Oui, mais tenons-nous bien, dit Grandet d'un ton qui fit fremir lepresident.--Serait-il en marche? pensa Cruchot.En ce moment, un coup de marteau annonca la famille des Grassins, etleur arrivee interrompit une conversation commencee entre madame Grandetet l'abbe.Madame des Grassins etait une de ces petites femmes vives, dodues,blanches et roses, qui, grace au regime claustral des provinces et auxhabitudes d'une vie vertueuse, se sont conservees jeunes encore aquarante ans. Elles sont comme ces dernieres roses de l'arriere-saison,dont la vue fait plaisir, mais dont les petales ont je ne sais quellefroideur, et dont le parfum s'affaiblit. Elle se mettait assez bien,faisait venir ses modes de Paris, donnait le ton a la ville de Saumur,et avait des soirees. Son mari, ancien quartier-maitre dans la gardeimperiale, grievement blesse a Austerlitz et retraite, conservait,malgre sa consideration pour Grandet, l'apparente franchise desmilitaires.--Bonjour, Grandet, dit-il au vigneron en lui tenant la main etaffectant une sorte de superiorite sous laquelle il ecrasait toujoursles Cruchot.--Mademoiselle, dit-il a Eugenie apres avoir salue madame Grandet, vousetes toujours belle et sage, je ne sais en verite ce que l'on peut voussouhaiter. Puis il presenta une petite caisse que son domestiqueportait, et qui contenait une bruyere du Cap, fleur nouvellementapportee en Europe et fort rare.Madame des Grassins embrassa tres affectueusement Eugenie, lui serra lamain, et lui dit:--Adolphe s'est charge de vous presenter mon petit souvenir.Un grand jeune homme blond, pale et frele, ayant d'assez bonnes facons,timide en apparence, mais qui venait de depenser a Paris, ou il etaitalle faire son Droit, huit ou dix mille francs en sus de sa pension,s'avanca vers Eugenie, l'embrassa sur les deux joues, et lui offrit uneboite a ouvrage dont tous les ustensiles etaient en vermeil, veritablemarchandise de pacotille, malgre l'ecusson sur lequel un E. G. gothiqueassez bien grave pouvait faire croire a une facon tres soignee. Enl'ouvrant, Eugenie eut une de ces joies inesperees et completes qui fontrougir, tressaillir, trembler d'aise les jeunes filles. Elle tourna lesyeux sur son pere, comme pour savoir s'il lui etait permis d'accepter,et monsieur Grandet dit un "Prends, ma fille!"dont l'accent eutillustre un acteur. Les trois Cruchot resterent stupefaits en voyant leregard joyeux et anime lance sur Adolphe des Grassins par l'heritiere aqui de semblables richesses parurent inouies. Monsieur des Grassinsoffrit a Grandet une prise de tabac, en saisit une, secoua les grainstombes sur le ruban de la Legion-d'Honneur attache a la boutonniere deson habit bleu, puis il regarda les Cruchot d'un air qui semblait dire:--Parez-moi cette botte-la? Madame des Grassins jeta les yeux sur lesbocaux bleus ou etaient les bouquets des Cruchot, en cherchant leurscadeaux avec la bonne foi jouee d'une femme moqueuse. Dans cetteconjoncture delicate, l'abbe Cruchot laissa la societe s'asseoir encercle devant le feu et alla se promener au fond de la salle avecGrandet. Quand ces deux vieillards furent dans l'embrasure de la fenetrela plus eloignee des Grassins:--Ces gens-la, dit le pretre a l'oreille de l'avare, jettent l'argentpar les fenetres.--Qu'est-ce que cela fait, s'il rentre dans ma cave, repliqua levigneron.--Si vous vouliez donner des ciseaux d'or a votre fille, vous en auriezbien le moyen, dit l'abbe.--Je lui donne mieux que des ciseaux, repondit Grandet.--Mon neveu est une cruche, pensa l'abbe en regardant le president dontles cheveux ebouriffes ajoutaient encore a la mauvaise grace de saphysionomie brune. Ne pouvait-il inventer une petite betise qui eut duprix.--Nous allons faire votre partie, madame Grandet, dit madame desGrassins.--Mais nous sommes tous reunis, _nous pouvons_ deux tables ...--Puisque c'est la fete d'Eugenie, faites votre loto general, dit lepere Grandet, ces deux enfants en seront. L'ancien tonnelier, qui nejouait jamais a aucun jeu, montra sa fille et Adolphe.--Allons, Nanon, mets les tables.--Nous allons vous aider, mademoiselle Nanon, dit gaiement madame desGrassins toute joyeuse de la joie qu'elle avait causee a Eugenie.--Je n'ai jamais de ma vie ete si contente, lui dit l'heritiere. Je n'airien vu de si joli nulle part.--C'est Adolphe qui l'a rapportee de Paris et qui l'a choisie, lui ditmadame des Grassins a l'oreille.--Va, va ton train, damnee intrigante! se disait le president; si tues jamais en proces, toi ou ton mari, votre affaire ne sera jamaisbonne.Le notaire, assis dans son coin, regardait l'abbe d'un air calme en sedisant:--Les des Grassins ont beau faire, ma fortune, celle de mon frere etcelle de mon neveu montent en somme a onze cent mille francs. Les desGrassins en ont tout au plus la moitie, et ils ont une fille: ilspeuvent offrir ce qu'ils voudront! heritiere et cadeaux, tout sera pournous un jour.A huit heures et demie du soir, deux tables etaient dressees. La joliemadame des Grassins avait reussi a mettre son fils a cote d'Eugenie. Lesacteurs de cette scene pleine d'interet, quoique vulgaire en apparence,munis de cartons barioles, chiffres, et de jetons en verre bleu,semblaient ecouter les plaisanteries du vieux notaire, qui ne tirait pasun numero sans faire une remarque; mais tous pensaient aux millions demonsieur Grandet. Le vieux tonnelier contemplait vaniteusement lesplumes roses, la toilette fraiche de madame des Grassins, la tetemartiale du banquier, celle d'Adolphe, le president, l'abbe, le notaire,et se disait interieurement: Ils sont la pour mes ecus. Ils viennents'ennuyer ici pour ma fille. He! ma fille ne sera ni pour les uns nipour les autres, et tous ces gens-la me servent de harpons pour pecher!Cette gaiete de famille, dans ce vieux salon gris, mal eclaire par deuxchandelles; ces rires, accompagnes par le bruit du rouet de la grandeNanon, et qui n'etaient sinceres que sur les levres d'Eugenie ou de samere; cette petitesse jointe a de si grands interets; cette jeunefille qui, semblable a ces oiseaux victimes du haut prix auquel on lesmet et qu'ils ignorent, se trouvait traquee, serree par des preuvesd'amitie dont elle etait la dupe; tout contribuait a rendre cette scenetristement comique. N'est-ce pas d'ailleurs une scene de tous les tempset de tous les lieux, mais ramenee a sa plus simple expression? Lafigure de Grandet exploitant le faux attachement des deux familles, entirant d'enormes profits, dominait ce drame et l'eclairait. N'etait-cepas le seul dieu moderne auquel on ait foi, l'Argent dans toute sapuissance, exprime par une seule physionomie? Les doux sentiments de lavie n'occupaient la qu'une place secondaire, ils animaient trois coeurspurs, ceux de Nanon, d'Eugenie et sa mere. Encore, combien d'ignorancedans leur naivete! Eugenie et sa mere ne savaient rien de la fortune deGrandet, elles n'estimaient les choses de la vie qu'a la lueur de leurspales idees, et ne prisaient ni ne meprisaient l'argent, accoutumeesqu'elles etaient a s'en passer. Leurs sentiments, froisses a leur insumais vivaces, le secret de leur existence, en faisaient des exceptionscurieuses dans cette reunion de gens dont la vie etait purementmaterielle. Affreuse condition de l'homme! il n'y a pas un de sesbonheurs qui ne vienne d'une ignorance quelconque. Au moment ou madameGrandet gagnait un lot de seize sous, le plus considerable qui eutjamais ete ponte dans cette salle, et que la grande Nanon riait d'aiseen voyant madame empochant cette riche somme, un coup de marteauretentit a la porte de la maison, et y fit un si grand tapage que lesfemmes sauterent sur leurs chaises.--Ce n'est pas un homme de Saumur qui frappe ainsi, dit le notaire.--Peut-on cogner comme ca, dit Nanon. Veulent-ils casser notre porte?--Quel diable est-ce? s'ecria Grandet.Nanon prit une des deux chandelles, et alla ouvrir accompagnee deGrandet.--Grandet, Grandet, s'ecria sa femme qui poussee par un vague sentimentde peur s'elanca vers la porte de la salle.Tous les joueurs se regarderent.--Si nous y allions, dit monsieur des Grassins. Ce coup de marteau meparait malveillant.A peine fut-il permis a monsieur des Grassins d'apercevoir la figured'un jeune homme accompagne du facteur des messageries, qui portait deuxmalles enormes et trainait des sacs de nuit. Grandet se retournabrusquement vers sa femme et lui dit:--Madame Grandet, allez a votre loto. Laissez-moi m'entendre avecmonsieur.Puis il tira vivement la porte de la salle, ou les joueurs agitesreprirent leurs places, mais sans continuer le jeu.--Est-ce quelqu'un de Saumur, monsieur des Grassins? lui dit sa femme.--Non, c'est un voyageur.--Il ne peut venir que de Paris. En effet, dit le notaire en tirant savieille montre epaisse de deux doigts et qui ressemblait a un vaisseauhollandais, il est _neuffe-s-heures_. Peste! la diligence du GrandBureau n'est jamais en retard.--Et ce monsieur est-il jeune? demanda l'abbe Cruchot.--Oui, repondit monsieur des Grassins. Il apporte des paquets quidoivent peser au moins trois cents kilos.--Nanon ne revient pas, dit Eugenie.--Ce ne peut etre qu'un de vos parents, dit le president.--Faisons les mises, s'ecria doucement Madame Grandet. A sa voix, j'aivu que monsieur Grandet etait contrarie, peut-etre ne serait-il pascontent de s'apercevoir que nous parlons de ses affaires.--Mademoiselle, dit Adolphe a sa voisine, ce sera sans doute votrecousin Grandet, un bien joli jeune homme que j'ai vu au bal de monsieurde Nucingen. Adolphe ne continua pas, sa mere lui marcha sur le pied,puis, en lui demandant a haute voix deux sous pour sa mise:--Veux-tu te taire, grand nigaud! lui dit-elle a l'oreille.En ce moment Grandet rentra sans la grande Nanon, dont le pas et celuidu facteur retentirent dans les escaliers; il etait suivi du voyageurqui depuis quelques instants excitait tant de curiosites et preoccupaitsi vivement les imaginations, que son arrivee en ce logis et sa chute aumilieu de ce monde peut etre comparee a celle d'un colimacon dans uneruche, ou a l'introduction d'un paon dans quelque obscure basse-cour devillage.--Asseyez-vous aupres du feu, lui dit Grandet.Avant de s'asseoir, le jeune etranger salua tres gracieusementl'assemblee. Les hommes se leverent pour repondre par une inclinationpolie, et les femmes firent une reverence ceremonieuse.--Vous avez sans doute froid, monsieur, dit madame Grandet, vous arrivezpeut-etre de ...--Voila bien les femmes! dit le vieux vigneron en quittant la lectured'une lettre qu'il tenait a la main, laissez donc monsieur se reposer.--Mais, mon pere, monsieur a peut-etre besoin de quelque chose, ditEugenie.--Il a une langue, repondit severement le vigneron.L'inconnu fut seul surpris de cette scene. Les autres personnes etaientfaites aux facons despotiques du bonhomme. Neanmoins, quand ces deuxdemandes et ces deux reponses furent echangees, l'inconnu se leva,presenta le dos au feu, leva l'un de ses pieds pour chauffer la semellede ses bottes, et dit a Eugenie:--Ma cousine, je vous remercie, j'ai dine a Tours. Et, ajouta-t-il enregardant Grandet, je n'ai besoin de rien, je ne suis meme pointfatigue.--Monsieur vient de la Capitale, demanda madame des Grassins.Monsieur Charles, ainsi se nommait le fils de monsieur Grandet de Paris,en s'entendant interpeller, prit un petit lorgnon suspendu par unechaine a son col, l'appliqua sur son oeil droit pour examiner et ce qu'ily avait sur la table et les personnes qui y etaient assises, lorgna fortimpertinemment madame des Grassins, et lui dit apres avoir tout vu:--Oui, madame. Vous jouez au loto, ma tante, ajouta-t-il, je vous enprie, continuez votre jeu, il est trop amusant pour le quitter ...--J'etais sure que c'etait le cousin, pensait madame des Grassins en luijetant de petites oeillades.--Quarante-sept, cria le vieil abbe. Marquez donc, madame des Grassins,n'est-ce pas votre numero?Monsieur des Grassins mit un jeton sur le carton de sa femme, qui,saisie par de tristes pressentiments, observa tour a tour le cousin deParis et Eugenie, sans songer au loto. De temps en temps, la jeuneheritiere lanca de furtifs regards a son cousin, et la femme du banquierput facilement y decouvrir un _crescendo_ d'etonnement ou de curiosite.*Le cousin de Paris* Monsieur Charles Grandet, beau jeune homme devingt-deux ans, produisait en ce moment un singulier contraste avec lesbons provinciaux que deja ses manieres aristocratiques revoltaientpassablement, et que tous etudiaient pour se moquer de lui. Ceci veutune explication. A vingt-deux ans, les jeunes gens sont encore assezvoisins de l'enfance pour se laisser aller a des enfantillages Aussi,peut-etre, sur cent d'entre eux, s'en rencontrerait-il bienquatre-vingt-dix-neuf qui se seraient conduits comme se conduisaitCharles Grandet. Quelques jours avant cette soiree, son pere lui avaitdit d'aller pour quelques mois chez son frere de Saumur. Peut-etremonsieur Grandet de Paris pensait-il a Eugenie. Charles, qui tombait enprovince pour la premiere fois, eut la pensee d'y paraitre avec lasuperiorite d'un jeune homme a la mode, de desesperer l'arrondissementpar son luxe, d'y faire epoque, et d'y importer les inventions de la vieparisienne. Enfin, pour tout expliquer d'un mot, il voulait passer aSaumur plus de temps qu'a Paris a se brosser les ongles, et y affecterl'excessive recherche de mise que parfois un jeune homme elegantabandonne pour une negligence qui ne manque pas de grace. Charlesemporta donc le plus joli costume de chasse, le plus joli fusil, le plusjoli couteau, la plus jolie gaine de Paris. Il emporta sa collection degilets les plus ingenieux: il y en avait de gris, de blancs, de noirs,de couleur scarabee, a reflets d'or, de pailletes, de chines, dedoubles, a chale ou droits de col, a col renverse, de boutonnes jusqu'enhaut, a boutons d'or. Il emporta toutes les varietes de cols et decravates en faveur a cette epoque. Il emporta deux habits de Buisson, etson linge le plus fin. Il emporta sa jolie toilette d'or, present de samere. Il emporta ses colifichets de dandy, sans oublier une ravissantepetite ecritoire donnee par la plus aimable des femmes, pour lui dumoins, par une grande dame qu'il nommait Annette, et qui voyageaitmaritalement, ennuyeusement, en Ecosse, victime de quelques soupconsauxquels besoin etait de sacrifier momentanement son bonheur; puisforce joli papier pour lui ecrire une lettre par quinzaine. Ce fut,enfin, une cargaison de futilites parisiennes aussi complete qu'il etaitpossible de la faire, et ou, depuis la cravache qui sert a commencer unduel, jusqu'aux beaux pistolets ciseles qui le terminent, se trouvaienttous les instruments aratoires dont se sert un jeune oisif pour labourerla vie. Son pere lui ayant dit de voyager seul et modestement, il etaitvenu dans le coupe de la diligence retenu pour seul, assez content de nepas gater une delicieuse voiture de voyage commandee pour allerau-devant de son Annette, la grande dame que ... etc., et qu'il devaitrejoindre en juin prochain aux Eaux de Baden. Charles comptaitrencontrer cent personnes chez son oncle, chasser a courre dans lesforets de son oncle, y vivre enfin de la vie de chateau; il ne savaitpas le trouver a Saumur ou il ne s'etait informe de lui que pourdemander le chemin de Froidfond; mais, en le sachant en ville, il crutl'y voir dans un grand hotel. Afin de debuter convenablement chez sononcle, soit a Saumur, soit a Froidfond, il avait fait la toilette devoyage la plus coquette, la plus simplement recherchee, la plusadorable, pour employer le mot qui dans ce temps resumait lesperfections speciales d'une chose ou d'un homme. A Tours, un coiffeurvenait de lui refriser ses beaux cheveux chatains; il y avait change delinge, et mis une cravate de satin noir combinee avec un col rond demaniere a encadrer agreablement sa blanche et rieuse figure. Uneredingote de voyage a demi boutonnee lui pincait la taille, et laissaitvoir un gilet de cachemire a chale sous lequel etait un second giletblanc. Sa montre, negligemment abandonnee au hasard dans une poche, serattachait par une courte chaine d'or a l'une des boutonnieres. Sonpantalon gris se boutonnait sur les cotes, ou des dessins brodes en soienoire enjolivaient les coutures. Il maniait agreablement une canne dontla pomme d'or sculpte n'alterait point la fraicheur de ses gants gris.Enfin, sa casquette etait d'un gout excellent. Un Parisien, un Parisiende la sphere la plus elevee, pouvait seul et s'agencer ainsi sansparaitre ridicule, et donner une harmonie de fatuite a toutes cesniaiseries, que soutenait d'ailleurs un air brave, l'air d'un jeunehomme qui a de beaux pistolets, le coup sur et Annette. Maintenant, sivous voulez bien comprendre la surprise respective des Saumurois et dujeune Parisien, voir parfaitement le vil eclat que l'elegance duvoyageur jetait au milieu des ombres grises de la salle, et des figuresqui composaient le tableau de famille, essayez de vous representer lesCruchot. Tous les trois prenaient du tabac et ne songeaient plus depuislongtemps a eviter ni les roupies, ni les petites galettes noires quiparsemaient le jabot de leurs chemises rousses, a cols recroquevilles eta plis jaunatres. Leurs cravates molles se roulaient en corde aussitotqu'ils se les etaient attachees au cou. L'enorme quantite de linge quileur permettait de ne faire la lessive que tous les six mois, et de legarder au fond de leurs armoires, laissait le temps y imprimer sesteintes grises et vieilles. Il y avait en eux une parfaite entente demauvaise grace et de senilite. Leurs figures, aussi fletries quel'etaient leurs habits rapes, aussi plissees que leurs pantalons,semblaient usees, racornies, et grimacaient. La negligence generale desautres costumes, tous incomplets, sans fraicheur, comme le sont lestoilettes de province, ou l'on arrive insensiblement a ne pluss'habiller les uns pour les autres, et a prendre garde au prix d'unepaire de gants, s'accordait avec l'insouciance des Cruchot. L'horreur dela mode etait le seul point sur lequel les Grassinistes et lesCruchotins s'entendissent parfaitement. Le Parisien prenait-il sonlorgnon pour examiner les singuliers accessoires de la salle, lessolives du plancher, le ton des boiseries ou les points que les mouchesy avaient imprimes et dont le nombre aurait suffi pour ponctuerl'Encyclopedie methodique et le Moniteur, aussitot les joueurs de lotolevaient le nez et le consideraient avec autant de curiosite qu'ils eneussent manifeste pour une girafe. Monsieur des Grassins et son fils,auxquels la figure d'un homme a la mode n'etait pas inconnue,s'associerent neanmoins a l'etonnement de leurs voisins, soit qu'ilseprouvassent l'indefinissable influence d'un sentiment general, soitqu'ils l'approuvassent en disant a leurs compatriotes par des oeilladespleines d'ironie:--Voila comme _ils_ sont a Paris. Tous pouvaient d'ailleurs observerCharles a loisir, sans craindre de deplaire au maitre du logis. Grandetetait absorbe dans la longue lettre qu'il tenait, et il avait pris pourla lire l'unique flambeau de la table, sans se soucier de ses hotes nide leur plaisir. Eugenie, a qui le type d'une perfection semblable, soitdans la mise, soit dans la personne, etait entierement inconnu, crutvoir en son cousin une creature descendue de quelque region seraphique.Elle respirait avec delices les parfums exhales par cette chevelure sibrillante, si gracieusement bouclee. Elle aurait voulu pouvoir toucherla peau blanche de ces jolis gants fins. Elle enviait les petites mainsde Charles, son teint, la fraicheur et la delicatesse de ses traits.Enfin, si toutefois cette image peut resumer les impressions que lejeune elegant produisit sur une ignorante fille sans cesse occupee arapetasser des bas, a ravauder la garde-robe de son pere, et dont la vies'etait ecoulee sous ces crasseux lambris sans voir dans cette ruesilencieuse plus d'un passant par heure, la vue de son cousin fitsourdre en son coeur les emotions de fine volupte que causent a un jeunehomme les fantastiques figures de femmes dessinees par Westall dans lesKeepsake anglais et gravees par les Finden d'un burin si habile qu'on apeur, en soufflant sur le velin, de faire envoler ces apparitionscelestes Charles tira de sa poche un mouchoir brode par la grande damequi voyageait en Ecosse. En voyant ce joli ouvrage fait avec amourpendant les heures perdues pour l'amour, Eugenie regarda son cousin poursavoir s'il allait bien reellement s'en servir. Les manieres de Charles,ses gestes, la facon dont il prenait son lorgnon, son impertinenceaffectee, son mepris pour le coffret qui venait de faire tant de plaisira la riche heritiere et qu'il trouvait evidemment ou sans valeur ouridicule; enfin, tout ce qui choquait les Cruchot et les des Grassinslui plaisait si fort qu'avant de s'endormir elle dut rever longtemps ace phenix des cousins.Les numeros se tiraient fort lentement, mais bientot le loto fut arrete.La grande Nanon entra et dit tout haut:--Madame, va falloir me donner des draps pour faire le lit a cemonsieur.Madame Grandet suivit Nanon. Madame des Grassins dit alors a voix basse:--Gardons nos sous et laissons le loto. Chacun reprit ses deux sous dansla vieille soucoupe ecornee ou il les avait mis. Puis l'assemblee seremua en masse et fit un quart de conversion vers le feu.--Vous avez donc fini? dit Grandet sans quitter sa lettre.--Oui, oui, repondit madame des Grassins en venant prendre place pres deCharles.Eugenie, mue par une de ces pensees qui naissent au coeur des jeunesfilles quand un sentiment s'y loge pour la premiere fois, quitta lasalle pour aller aider sa mere et Nanon. Si elle avait ete questionneepar un confesseur habile, elle lui eut sans doute avoue qu'elle nesongeait ni a sa mere ni a Nanon, mais qu'elle etait travaillee par unpoignant desir d'inspecter la chambre de son cousin pour s'y occuper deson cousin, pour y placer quoi que ce fut, pour obvier a un oubli, poury tout prevoir, afin de la rendre, autant que possible, elegante etpropre. Eugenie se croyait deja seule capable de comprendre les gouts etles idees de son cousin. En effet, elle arriva fort heureusement pourprouver a sa mere et a Nanon, qui revenaient pensant avoir tout fait,que tout etait a faire. Elle donna l'idee a la grande Nanon de bassinerles draps avec la braise du feu, elle couvrit elle-meme la vieille tabled'un napperon, et recommanda bien a Nanon de changer le napperon tousles matins. Elle convainquit sa mere de la necessite d'allumer un bonfeu dans la cheminee, et determina Nanon a monter, sans en rien dire ason pere, un gros tas de bois dans le corridor. Elle courut chercherdans une des encoignures de la salle un plateau de vieux laque quivenait de la succession de feu le vieux monsieur de La Bertelliere, yprit egalement un verre de cristal a six pans, une petite cuillerdedoree, un flacon antique ou etaient graves des amours, et mittriomphalement le tout sur un coin de la cheminee. Il lui avait plussurgi d'idees en un quart d'heure qu'elle n'en avait eu depuis qu'elleetait au monde.--Maman, dit-elle, jamais mon cousin ne supportera l'odeur d'unechandelle. Si nous achetions de la bougie?... Elle alla, legere comme unoiseau, tirer de sa bourse l'ecu de cent sous qu'elle avait recu pourses depenses du mois.--Tiens, Nanon, dit-elle, va vite.--Mais, que dira ton pere? Cette objection terrible fut proposee parmadame Grandet en voyant sa fille armee d'un sucrier de vieux Sevresrapporte du chateau de Froidfond par Grandet.--Et ou prendras-tu donc du sucre? es-tu folle?--Maman, Nanon achetera aussi bien du sucre que de la bougie.--Mais ton pere?--Serait-il convenable que son neveu ne put boire un verre d'eau sucree? D'ailleurs, il n'y fera pas attention.--Ton pere voit tout, dit madame Grandet en hochant la tete.Nanon hesitait, elle connaissait son maitre.--Mais va donc, Nanon, puisque c'est ma fete!Nanon laissa echapper un gros rire en entendant la premiere plaisanterieque sa jeune maitresse eut jamais faite, et lui obeit. Pendantqu'Eugenie et sa mere s'efforcaient d'embellir la chambre destinee parmonsieur Grandet a son neveu, Charles se trouvait l'objet des attentionsde madame des Grassins, qui lui faisait des agaceries.--Vous etes bien courageux, monsieur, lui dit-elle, de quitter lesplaisirs de la capitale pendant l'hiver pour venir habiter Saumur. Maissi nous ne vous faisons pas trop peur, vous verrez que l'on peut encores'y amuser.Elle lui lanca une veritable oeillade de province, ou, par habitude, lesfemmes mettent tant de reserve et de prudence dans leurs yeux qu'ellesleur communiquent la friande concupiscence particuliere a ceux desecclesiastiques, pour qui tout plaisir semble ou un vol ou une faute.Charles se trouvait si depayse dans cette salle, si loin du vastechateau et de la fastueuse existence qu'il supposait a son oncle, qu'enregardant attentivement madame des Grassins, il apercut enfin une imagea demi effacee des figures parisiennes. Il repondit avec grace al'espece d'invitation qui lui etait adressee, et il s'engageanaturellement une conversation dans laquelle madame des Grassins baissagraduellement sa voix pour la mettre en harmonie avec la nature de sesconfidences. Il existait chez elle et chez Charles un meme besoin deconfiance. Aussi, apres quelques moments de causerie coquette et deplaisanteries serieuses, l'adroite provinciale put-elle lui dire sans secroire entendue des autres personnes, qui parlaient de la vente desvins, dont s'occupait en ce moment tout le Saumurois:--Monsieur, si vous voulez nous faire l'honneur de venir nous voir, vousferez tres certainement autant de plaisir a mon mari qu'a moi. Notresalon est le seul dans Saumur ou vous trouverez reunis le haut commerceet la noblesse: nous appartenons aux deux societes, qui ne veulent serencontrer que la parce qu'on s'y amuse. Mon mari, je le dis avecorgueil, est egalement considere par les uns et par les autres. Ainsi,nous tacherons de faire diversion a l'ennui de votre sejour ici. Si vousrestiez chez monsieur Grandet, que deviendriez-vous, bon Dieu! Votreoncle est un grigou qui ne pense qu'a ses provins, votre tante est unedevote qui ne sait pas coudre deux idees, et votre cousine est unepetite sotte, sans education, commune, sans dot, et qui passe sa vie araccommoder des torchons.--Elle est tres bien, cette femme, se dit en lui-meme Charles Grandet enrepondant aux minauderies de madame des Grassins.--Il me semble, ma femme, que tu veux accaparer monsieur, dit en riantle gros et grand banquier.A cette observation, le notaire et le president dirent des mots plus oumoins malicieux; mais l'abbe les regarda d'un air fin et resuma leurspensees en prenant une pincee de tabac, et offrant sa tabatiere a laronde:--Qui mieux que madame, dit-il, pourrait faire a monsieur les honneursde Saumur?--Ha! ca, comment l'entendez-vous, monsieur l'abbe? demanda monsieurdes Grassins.--Je l'entends, monsieur, dans le sens la plus favorable pour vous, pourmadame, pour la ville de Saumur et pour monsieur, ajouta le rusevieillard en se tournant vers Charles.Sans paraitre y preter la moindre attention, l'abbe Cruchot avait sudeviner la conversation de Charles et de madame des Grassins.--Monsieur, dit enfin Adolphe a Charles d'un air qu'il aurait voulurendre degage, je ne sais si vous avez conserve quelque souvenir de moi;j'ai eu le plaisir d'etre votre vis-a-vis a un bal donne par monsieurle baron de Nucingen, et ...--Parfaitement, monsieur, parfaitement, repondit Charles surpris de sevoir l'objet des attentions de tout le monde.--Monsieur est votre fils? demanda-t-il a madame des Grassins.L'abbe regarda malicieusement la mere.--Oui, monsieur, dit-elle.--Vous etiez donc bien jeune a Paris? reprit Charles en s'adressant aAdolphe.--Que voulez-vous, monsieur, dit l'abbe, nous les envoyons a Babyloneaussitot qu'ils sont sevres.Madame des Grassins interrogea l'abbe par un regard d'une etonnanteprofondeur.--Il faut venir en province, dit-il en continuant, pour trouver desfemmes de trente et quelques annees aussi fraiches que l'est madame,apres avoir eu des fils bientot Licencies en Droit. Il me semble etreencore au jour ou les jeunes gens et les dames montaient sur des chaisespour vous voir danser au bal, madame, ajouta l'abbe en se tournant versson adversaire femelle. Pour moi, vos succes sont d'hier ...--Oh! le vieux scelerat! se dit en elle-meme madame des Grassins, medevinerait-il donc?--Il parait que j'aurai beaucoup de succes a Saumur, se disait Charlesen deboutonnant sa redingote, se mettant la main dans son gilet, etjetant son regard a travers les espaces pour imiter la pose donnee alord Byron par Chantrey.L'inattention du pere Grandet, ou, pour mieux dire, la preoccupationdans laquelle le plongeait la lecture de sa lettre, n'echapperent ni aunotaire ni au president qui tachaient d'en conjecturer le contenu parles imperceptibles mouvements de la figure du bonhomme, alors fortementeclairee par la chandelle. Le vigneron maintenait difficilement le calmehabituel de sa physionomie. D'ailleurs chacun pourra se peindre lacontenance affectee par cet homme en lisant la fatale lettre que voici:"Mon frere, voici bientot vingt-trois ans que nous ne nous sommes vus.Mon mariage a ete l'objet de notre derniere entrevue, apres laquellenous nous sommes quittes joyeux l'un et l'autre. Certes je ne pouvaisguere prevoir que tu serais un jour le seul soutien de la famille, a laprosperite de laquelle tu applaudissais alors. Quand tu tiendras cettelettre en tes mains, je n'existerai plus. Dans la position ou j'etais,je n'ai pas voulu survivre a la honte d'une faillite. Je me suis tenusur le bord du gouffre jusqu'au dernier moment, esperant surnagertoujours. Il faut y tomber. Les banqueroutes reunies de mon agent dechange et de Roguin, mon notaire, m'emportent mes dernieres ressourceset ne me laissent rien. J'ai la douleur de devoir pres de quatremillions sans pouvoir offrir plus de vingt-cinq pour cent d'actif. Mesvins emmagasines eprouvent en ce moment la baisse ruineuse que causentl'abondance et la qualite de vos recoltes. Dans trois jours Paris dira:"Monsieur Grandet etait un fripon!" Je me coucherai, moi probe, dansun linceul d'infamie. Je ravis a mon fils et son nom que j'entache et lafortune de sa mere. Il ne sait rien de cela, ce malheureux enfant quej'idolatre. Nous nous sommes dit adieu tendrement. Il ignorait, parbonheur, que les derniers flots de ma vie s'epanchaient dans cet adieu.Ne me maudira-t-il pas un jour? Mon frere, mon frere, la malediction denos enfants est epouvantable; ils peuvent appeler de la notre, mais laleur est irrevocable."Grandet, tu es mon aine, tu me dois ta protection: fais que Charlesne jette aucune parole amere sur ma tombe! Mon frere, si je t'ecrivaisavec mon sang et mes larmes, il n'y aurait pas autant de douleurs quej'en mets dans cette lettre; car je pleurerais, je saignerais, jeserais mort, je ne souffrirais plus; mais je souffre et vois la mortd'un oeil sec. Te voila donc le pere de Charles! il n'a point de parentsdu cote maternel, tu sais pourquoi. Pourquoi n'ai-je pas obei auxprejuges sociaux? Pourquoi ai-je cede a l'amour? Pourquoi ai-je epousela fille naturelle d'un grand seigneur? Charles n'a plus de famille. Omon malheureux fils! mon fils! Ecoute, Grandet, je ne suis pas venut'implorer pour moi; d'ailleurs tes biens ne sont peut-etre pas assezconsiderables pour supporter une hypotheque de trois millions; maispour mon fils! Sache-le bien, mon frere, mes mains suppliantes se sontjointes en pensant a toi. Grandet, je te confie Charles en mourant.Enfin je regarde mes pistolets sans douleur en pensant que tu luiserviras de pere. Il m'aimait bien, Charles; j'etais si bon pour lui,je ne le contrariais jamais: il ne me maudira pas. D'ailleurs, tuverras, il est doux, il tient de sa mere, il ne te donnera jamais dechagrin. Pauvre enfant! accoutume aux jouissances du luxe, il neconnait aucune des privations auxquelles nous a condamnes l'un etl'autre notre premiere misere ... Et le voila ruine, seul. Oui, tous sesamis le fuiront, et c'est moi qui serai la cause de ses humiliations. Ah!je voudrais avoir le bras assez fort pour l'envoyer d'un seul coupdans les cieux pres de sa mere. Folie! Je reviens a mon malheur, acelui de Charles. Je te l'ai donc envoye pour que tu lui apprennesconvenablement et ma mort et son sort a venir. Sois un pere pour lui,mais un bon pere."Ne l'arrache pas tout a coup a sa vie oisive, tu le tuerais. Je luidemande a genoux de renoncer aux creances qu'en qualite d'heritier de samere il pourrait exercer contre moi. Mais c'est une priere superflue;il a de l'honneur, et sentira bien qu'il ne doit pas se joindre a mescreanciers. Fais-le renoncer a ma succession en temps utile. Revele-luiles dures conditions de la vie que je lui fais; et s'il me conserve satendresse, dis-lui bien en mon nom que tout n'est pas perdu pour lui.Oui, le travail, qui nous a sauves tous deux, peut lui rendre la fortuneque je lui emporte; et, s'il veut ecouter la voix de son pere, qui pourlui voudrait sortir un moment du tombeau, qu'il parte, qu'il aille auxIndes! Mon frere, Charles est un jeune homme probe et courageux: tului feras une pacotille, il mourrait plutot que de ne pas te rendre lespremiers fonds que tu lui preteras; car tu lui en preteras, Grandet!sinon tu te creerais des remords. Ah! si mon enfant ne trouvait nisecours ni tendresse en toi, je demanderais eternellement vengeance aDieu de ta durete. Si j'avais pu sauver quelques valeurs, j'avais bienle droit de lui remettre une somme sur le bien de sa mere; mais lespayements de ma fin du mois avaient absorbe toutes mes ressources. Jen'aurais pas voulu mourir dans le doute sur le sort de mon enfant;j'aurais voulu sentir de saintes promesses dans la chaleur de ta main,qui m'eut rechauffe; mais le temps me manque. Pendant que Charlesvoyage, je suis oblige de dresser mon bilan. Je tache de prouver par labonne foi qui preside a mes affaires qu'il n'y a dans mes desastres nifaute ni improbite. N'est-ce pas m'occuper de Charles? Adieu, monfrere. Que toutes les benedictions de Dieu te soient acquises pour lagenereuse tutelle que je te confie, et que tu acceptes, je n'en doutepas. Il y aura sans cesse une voix qui priera pour toi dans le monde ounous devons aller tous un jour, et ou je suis deja.Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet. "--Vous causez donc? dit le pere Grandet en pliant avec exactitude lalettre dans les memes plis et la mettant dans la poche de son gilet. Ilregarda son neveu d'un air humble et craintif sous lequel il cacha sesemotions et ses calculs.--Vous etes-vous rechauffe?--Tres bien, mon cher oncle.--He! bien, ou sont donc nos femmes? dit l'oncle oubliant deja que sonneveu couchait chez lui. En ce moment Eugenie et ma dame Grandetrentrerent.--Tout est-il arrange la-haut? leur demanda le bonhomme en retrouvantson calme.--Oui, mon pere.--He! bien, mon neveu, si vous etes fatigue, Nanon va vous conduire avotre chambre. Dame, ce ne sera pas un appartement de _mirliflor_! maisvous excuserez de pauvres vignerons qui n'ont jamais le sou. Les impotsnous avalent tout.--Nous ne voulons pas etre indiscrets, Grandet, dit le banquier. Vouspouvez avoir a jaser avec votre neveu, nous vous souhaitons le bonsoir.A demain.A ces mots, l'assemblee se leva, et chacun fit la reverence suivant soncaractere. Le vieux notaire alla chercher sous la porte sa lanterne, etvint l'allumer en offrant aux des Grassins de les reconduire. Madame desGrassins n'avait pas prevu l'incident qui devait faire finirprematurement la soiree, et son domestique n'etait pas arrive.--Voulez-vous me faire l'honneur d'accepter mon bras, madame? ditl'abbe Cruchot a madame des Grassins.--Merci, monsieur l'abbe. J'ai mon fils, repondit-elle sechement.--Les dames ne sauraient se compromettre avec moi, dit l'abbe.--Donne donc le bras a monsieur Cruchot, lui dit son mari.L'abbe emmena la jolie dame assez lestement pour se trouver a quelquespas en avant de la caravane.--Il est tres bien, ce jeune homme, madame, lui dit-il en lui serrant lebras. _Adieu, paniers, vendanges sont faites_! Il vous faut dire adieua mademoiselle Grandet, Eugenie sera pour le Parisien. A moins que cecousin ne soit amourache d'une Parisienne, votre fils Adolphe varencontrer en lui le rival le plus ...--Laissez donc, monsieur l'abbe. Ce jeune homme ne tardera pas as'apercevoir qu'Eugenie est une niaise, une fille sans fraicheur.L'avez-vous examinee? elle etait, ce soir, jaune comme un coing.--Vous l'avez peut-etre deja fait remarquer au cousin.--Et je ne m'en suis pas genee ...--Mettez-vous toujours aupres d'Eugenie, madame, et vous n'aurez pasgrand'chose a dire a ce jeune homme contre sa cousine, il fera delui-meme une comparaison qui ...--D'abord, il m'a promis de venir diner apres-demain chez moi.--Ah! si vous vouliez, madame, dit l'abbe.--Et que voulez-vous que je veuille, monsieur l'abbe? Entendez-vousainsi me donner de mauvais conseils? Je ne suis pas arrivee a l'age detrente-neuf ans, avec une reputation sans tache, Dieu merci, pour lacompromettre, meme quand il s'agirait de l'empire du Grand-Mogol. Noussommes a un age, l'un et l'autre, auquel on sait ce que parler veutdire. Pour un ecclesiastique, vous avez en verite des idees bienincongrues. Fi! cela est digne de Faublas.--Vous avez donc lu Faublas?--Non, monsieur l'abbe, je voulais dire les Liaisons Dangereuses.--Ah! ce livre est infiniment plus moral, dit en riant l'abbe. Maisvous me faites aussi pervers que l'est un jeune homme d'aujourd'hui! Jevoulais simplement vous ...--Osez me dire que vous ne songiez pas a me conseiller de vilaineschoses. Cela n'est-il pas clair? Si ce jeune homme, qui est tres bien,j'en conviens, me faisait la cour, il ne penserait pas a sa cousine. AParis, je le sais, quelques bonnes meres se devouent ainsi pour lebonheur et la fortune de leurs enfants; mais nous sommes en province,monsieur l'abbe.--Oui, madame.--Et, reprit-elle, je ne voudrais pas, ni Adolphe lui-meme ne voudraitpas de cent millions achetes a ce prix ...--Madame, je n'ai point parle de cent millions. La tentation eut etepeut-etre au-dessus de nos forces a l'un et a l'autre. Seulement jecrois qu'une honnete femme peut se permettre, en tout bien tout honneur,de petites coquetteries sans consequence, qui font partie de ses devoirsen societe, et qui ...--Vous croyez?--Ne devons-nous pas, madame, tacher de nous etre agreables les uns auxautres ... Permettez que je me mouche.--Je vous assure, madame, reprit-il, qu'il vous lorgnait d'un air un peuplus flatteur que celui qu'il avait en me regardant; mais je luipardonne d'honorer preferablement a la vieillesse la beaute ...--Il est clair, disait le president de sa grosse voix, que monsieurGrandet de Paris envoie son fils a Saumur dans des intentionsextremement matrimoniales ...--Mais, alors, le cousin ne serait pas tombe comme une bombe, repondaitle notaire.--Cela ne dirait rien, dit monsieur des Grassins, le bonhomme est_cachottier_.--Des Grassins, mon ami, je l'ai invite a diner, ce jeune homme. Ilfaudra que tu ailles prier monsieur et madame de Larsonniere, et les duHautoy, avec la belle demoiselle du Hautoy, bien entendu; pourvuqu'elle se mette bien ce jour-la! Par jalousie, sa mere la fagote simal! J'espere, messieurs, que vous nous ferez l'honneur de venir,ajouta-t-elle en arretant le cortege pour se retourner vers les deuxCruchot.--Vous voila chez vous, madame, dit le notaire.Apres avoir salue les trois des Grassins, les trois Cruchot s'enretournerent chez eux, en se servant de ce genie d'analyse que possedentles provinciaux pour etudier sous toutes ses faces le grand evenement decette soiree, qui changeait les positions respectives des Cruchotins etdes Grassinistes. L'admirable bon sens qui dirigeait les actions de cesgrands calculateurs leur fit sentir aux uns et aux autres la necessited'une alliance momentanee contre l'ennemi commun. Ne devaient-ils pasmutuellement empecher Eugenie d'aimer son cousin, et Charles de penser asa cousine? Le Parisien pourrait-il resister aux insinuations perfides,aux calomnies doucereuses, aux medisances pleines d'eloges, auxdenegations naives qui allaient constamment tourner autour de lui etl'engluer, comme les abeilles enveloppent de cire le colimacon tombedans leur ruche?Lorsque les quatre parents se trouverent seuls dans la salle, monsieurGrandet dit a son neveu:--Il faut se coucher. Il est trop tard pour causer des affaires qui vousamenent ici, nous prendrons demain un moment convenable. Ici, nousdejeunons a huit heures. A midi, nous mangeons un fruit, un rien de painsur le pouce, et nous buvons un verre de vin blanc; puis nous dinons,comme les Parisiens, a cinq heures. Voila l'ordre. Si vous voulez voirla ville ou les environs, vous serez libre comme l'air. Vous m'excuserezsi mes affaires ne me permettent pas toujours de vous accompagner. Vousles entendrez peut-etre tous ici vous disant que je suis riche:monsieur Grandet par-ci, monsieur Grandet par la! Je les laisse dire,leurs bavardages ne nuisent point a mon credit. Mais je n'ai pas le sou,et je travaille a mon age comme un jeune compagnon, qui n'a pour toutbien qu'une mauvaise plaine et deux bons bras. Vous verrez peut-etrebientot par vous-meme ce que coute un ecu quand il faut le suer. Allons,Nanon, les chandelles?--J'espere, mon neveu, que vous trouverez tout ce dont vous aurezbesoin, dit madame Grandet; mais s'il vous manquait quelque chose, vouspourrez appeler Nanon.--Ma chere tante, ce serait difficile, j'ai, je crois, emporte toutesmes affaires! Permettez-moi de vous souhaiter une bonne nuit, ainsiqu'a ma jeune cousine.Charles prit des mains de Nanon une bougie allumee, une bougie d'Anjou,bien jaune de ton, vieillie en boutique et si pareille a de lachandelle, que monsieur Grandet, incapable d'en soupconner l'existenceau logis, ne s'apercut pas de cette magnificence.--Je vais vous montrer le chemin, dit le bonhomme.Au lieu de sortir par la porte de la salle qui donnait sous la voute,Grandet fit la ceremonie de passer par le couloir qui separait la sallede la cuisine. Une porte battante garnie d'un grand carreau de verreovale fermait ce couloir du cote de l'escalier afin de temperer le froidqui s'y engouffrait. Mais en hiver la brise n'en sifflait pas moins parla tres rudement, et, malgre les bourrelets mis aux portes de la salle,a peine la chaleur s'y maintenait-elle a un degre convenable. Nanon allaverrouiller la grande porte, ferma la salle, et detacha dans l'ecurie unchien-loup dont la voix etait cassee comme s'il avait une laryngite. Cetanimal d'une notable ferocite ne connaissait que Nanon. Ces deuxcreatures champetres s'entendaient. Quand Charles vit les murs jaunatreset enfumes de la cage ou l'escalier a rampe vermoulue tremblait sous lepas pesant de son oncle, son degrisement alla _rinforzando_. Il secroyait dans un juchoir a poules. Sa tante et sa cousine, verslesquelles il se retourna pour interroger leurs figures, etaient si bienfaconnees a cet escalier, que, ne devinant pas la cause de sonetonnement, elles le prirent pour une expression amicale, et yrepondirent par un sourire agreable qui le desespera.--Que diable mon pere m'envoie-t-il faire ici? se disait-il.Arrive sur le premier palier, il apercut trois portes peintes en rougeetrusque et sans chambranles, des portes perdues dans la muraillepoudreuse et garnies de bandes en fer boulonnees, apparentes, termineesen facon de flammes comme l'etait a chaque bout la longue entree de laserrure. Celle de ces portes qui se trouvait en haut de l'escalier etqui donnait entree dans la piece situee au-dessus de la cuisine, etaitevidemment muree. On n'y penetrait en effet que par la chambre deGrandet, a qui cette piece servait de cabinet. L'unique croisee d'ouelle tirait son jour etait defendue sur la cour par d'enormes barreauxen fer grillages. Personne, pas meme madame Grandet, n'avait lapermission d'y venir, le bonhomme voulait y rester seul comme unalchimiste a son fourneau. La, sans doute, quelque cachette avait etetres habilement pratiquee, la s'emmagasinaient les titres de propriete,la pendaient les balances a peser les louis, la se faisaient nuitammentet en secret les quittances, les recus, les calculs; de maniere que lesgens d'affaires, voyant toujours Grandet pret a tout, pouvaient imaginerqu'il avait a ses ordres une fee ou un demon. La, sans doute, quandNanon ronflait a ebranler les planchers, quand le chien-loup veillait etbaillait dans la cour, quand madame et mademoiselle Grandet etaient bienendormies, venait le vieux tonnelier choyer, caresser, couver, cuver,cercler son or. Les murs etaient epais, les contrevents discrets. Luiseul avait la clef de ce laboratoire, ou, dit-on, il consultait desplans sur lesquels ses arbres a fruits etaient designes et ou ilchiffrait ses produits a un provin, a une bourree pres. L'entree de lachambre d'Eugenie faisait face a cette porte muree. Puis, au bout dupalier, etait l'appartement des deux epoux qui occupaient tout le devantde la maison. Madame Grandet avait une chambre contigue a celled'Eugenie, chez qui l'on entrait par une porte vitree. La chambre dumaitre etait separee de celle de sa femme par une cloison, et dumysterieux cabinet par un gros mur. Le pere Grandet avait loge son neveuau second etage, dans la haute mansarde situee au-dessus de sa chambre,de maniere a pouvoir l'entendre, s'il lui prenait fantaisie d'aller etde venir. Quand Eugenie et sa mere arriverent au milieu du palier, ellesse donnerent le baiser du soir; puis, apres avoir dit a Charlesquelques mots d'adieu, froids sur les levres, mais certes chaleureux aucoeur de la fille, elles rentrerent dans leurs chambres.--Vous voila chez vous, mon neveu, dit le pere Grandet a Charles en luiouvrant sa porte. Si vous aviez besoin de sortir, vous appelleriezNanon. Sans elle, votre serviteur! le chien vous mangerait sans vousdire un seul mot. Dormez bien. Bonsoir. Ha! ha! ces dames vous ontfait du feu, reprit-il. En ce moment la grande Nanon apparut, armeed'une bassinoire.--En voila bien d'une autre! dit monsieur Grandet. Prenez-vous monneveu pour une femme en couches? Veux-tu bien remporter ta braise,Nanon.--Mais, monsieur, les draps sont humides, et ce monsieur est vraimentmignon comme une femme.--Allons, va, puisque tu l'as dans la tete, dit Grandet en la poussantpar les epaules, mais prends garde de mettre le feu. Puis l'avaredescendit en grommelant de vagues paroles.Charles demeura pantois au milieu de ses malles. Apres avoir jete lesyeux sur les murs d'une chambre en mansarde tendue de ce papier jaune abouquets de fleurs qui tapisse les guinguettes, sur une cheminee enpierre de liais cannelee dont le seul aspect donnait froid, sur deschaises de bois jaune garnies en canne vernissee et qui semblaient avoirplus de quatre angles, sur une table de nuit ouverte dans laquelleaurait pu tenir un petit sergent de voltigeurs, sur le maigre tapis delisiere place au bas d'un lit a ciel dont les pentes en drap tremblaientcomme si elles allaient tomber, achevees par les vers, il regardaserieusement la grande Nanon et lui dit:--Ah ca! ma chere enfant, suis-je bien chez monsieur Grandet, l'ancienmaire de Saumur, frere de monsieur Grandet de Paris?--Oui, monsieur, chez un ben aimable, un ben doux, un ben parfaitmonsieur. Faut-il que je vous aide a defaire vos malles?--Ma foi, je le veux bien, mon vieux troupier! N'avez-vous pas servidans les marins de la garde imperiale?--Oh! oh! oh! oh! dit Nanon, quoi que c'est que ca, les marins de lagarde? C'est-y sale? Ca va-t-il sur l'eau?--Tenez, cherchez ma robe de chambre qui est dans cette valise. En voicila clef.Nanon fut tout emerveillee de voir une robe de chambre en soie verte afleurs d'or et a dessins antiques.--Vous allez mettre ca pour vous coucher, dit-elle.--Oui.--Sainte-Vierge! le beau devant d'autel pour la paroisse. Mais, moncher mignon monsieur, donnez donc ca a l'eglise, vous sauverez votreame, tandis que ca vous la fera perdre. Oh! que vous etes donc gentilcomme ca. Je vais appeler mademoiselle pour qu'elle vous regarde.--Allons, Nanon, puisque Nanon y a, voulez-vous vous taire! Laissez-moicoucher, j'arrangerai mes affaires demain; et si ma robe vous plaittant, vous sauverez votre ame. Je suis trop bon chretien pour vous larefuser en m'en allant, et vous pourrez en faire ce que vous voudrez.Nanon resta plantee sur ses pieds, contemplant Charles, sans pouvoirajouter foi a ses paroles.--Me donner ce bel atour! dit-elle en s'en allant. Il reve deja, cemonsieur. Bonsoir.--Bonsoir, Nanon.--Qu'est-ce que je suis venu faire ici? se dit Charles en s'endormant.Mon pere n'est pas un niais, mon voyage doit avoir un but. Psch! ademain les affaires serieuses, disait je ne sais quelle ganache grecque.--Sainte-Vierge! qu'il est gentil, mon cousin, se dit Eugenie eninterrompant ses prieres qui ce soir-la ne furent pas finies.Madame Grandet n'eut aucune pensee en se couchant. Elle entendait, parla porte de communication qui se trouvait au milieu de la cloison,l'avare se promenant de long en long dans sa chambre. Semblable a toutesles femmes timides, elle avait etudie le caractere de son seigneur. Dememe que la mouette prevoit l'orage, elle avait, a d'imperceptiblessignes, pressenti la tempete interieure qui agitait Grandet, et, pouremployer l'expression dont elle se servait, elle faisait alors la morte.Grandet regardait la porte interieurement doublee en tole qu'il avaitfait mettre a son cabinet, et se disait:--Quelle idee bizarre a eue mon frere de me leguer son enfant? Joliesuccession! Je n'ai pas vingt ecus a donner. Mais qu'est-ce que vingtecus pour ce mirliflor qui lorgnait mon barometre comme s'il avait vouluen faire du feu?En songeant aux consequences de ce testament de douleur, Grandet etaitpeut-etre plus agite que ne l'etait son frere au moment ou il le traca.--J'aurais cette robe d'or?... disait Nanon qui s'endormit habillee deson devant d'autel, revant de fleurs, de tabis, de damas, pour lapremiere fois de sa vie, comme Eugenie reva d'amour.Dans la pure et monotone vie des jeunes filles, il vient une heuredelicieuse ou le soleil leur epanche ses rayons dans l'ame, ou la fleurleur exprime des pensees, ou les palpitations du coeur communiquent aucerveau leur chaude fecondance, et fondent les idees en un vague desir;jour d'innocente melancolie et de suaves joyeusetes! Quand les enfantscommencent a voir, ils sourient; quand une fille entrevoit le sentimentdans la nature, elle sourit comme elle souriait enfant. Si la lumiereest le premier amour de la vie, l'amour n'est-il pas la lumiere du coeur?Le moment de voir clair aux choses d'ici-bas etait arrive pourEugenie. Matinale comme toutes les filles de province, elle se leva debonne heure, fit sa priere, et commenca l'oeuvre de sa toilette,occupation qui desormais allait avoir un sens. Elle lissa d'abord sescheveux chatains, tordit leurs grosses nattes au-dessus de sa tete avecle plus grand soin, en evitant que les cheveux ne s'echappassent deleurs tresses, et introduisit dans sa coiffure une symetrie qui rehaussala timide candeur de son visage, en accordant la simplicite desaccessoires a la naivete des lignes. En se lavant plusieurs fois lesmains dans de l'eau pure qui lui durcissait et rougissait la peau, elleregarda ses beaux bras ronds, et se demanda ce que faisait son cousinpour avoir les mains si mollement blanches, les ongles si bien faconnes.Elle mit des bas neufs et ses plus jolis souliers. Elle se laca droit,sans passer d'oeillets. Enfin souhaitant, pour la premiere fois de savie, de paraitre a son avantage, elle connut le bonheur d'avoir une robefraiche, bien faite, et qui la rendait attrayante. Quand sa toilette futachevee, elle entendit sonner l'horloge de la paroisse, et s'etonna dene compter que sept heures. Le desir d'avoir tout le temps necessairepour se bien habiller l'avait fait lever trop tot. Ignorant l'art deremanier dix fois une boucle de cheveux et d'en etudier l'effet, Eugeniese croisa bonnement les bras, s'assit a sa fenetre, contempla la cour,le jardin etroit et les hautes terrasses qui le dominaient; vuemelancolique, bornee, mais qui n'etait pas depourvue des mysterieusesbeautes particulieres aux endroits solitaires ou a la nature inculte.Aupres de la cuisine se trouvait un puits entoure d'une margelle, et apoulie maintenue dans une branche de fer courbee, qu'embrassait unevigne aux pampres fletris, rougis, brouis par la saison. De la, letortueux sarment gagnait le mur, s'y attachait, courait le long de lamaison et finissait sur un bucher ou le bois etait range avec autantd'exactitude que peuvent l'etre les livres d'un bibliophile. Le pave dela cour offrait ces teintes noiratres produites avec le temps par lesmousses, par les herbes, par le defaut de mouvement. Les murs epaispresentaient leur chemise verte, ondee de longues traces brunes. Enfinles huit marches qui regnaient au fond de la cour et menaient a la portedu jardin, etaient disjointes et ensevelies sous de hautes plantes commele tombeau d'un chevalier enterre par sa veuve au temps des croisades.Au-dessus d'une assise de pierres toutes rongees s'elevait une grille debois pourri, a moitie tombee de vetuste, mais a laquelle se mariaient aleur gre des plantes grimpantes. De chaque cote de la porte aclaire-voie s'avancaient les rameaux tortus de deux pommiers rabougris.Trois allees paralleles, sablees et separees par des carres dont lesterres etaient maintenues au moyen d'une bordure en buis, composaient cejardin que terminait, au bas de la terrasse, un couvert de tilleuls. Aun bout, des framboisiers; a l'autre, un immense noyer qui inclinaitses branches jusque sur le cabinet du tonnelier. Un jour pur et le beausoleil des automnes naturels aux rives de la Loire commencaient adissiper le glacis imprime par la nuit aux pittoresques objets, auxmurs, aux plantes qui meublaient ce jardin et la cour. Eugenie trouvades charmes tout nouveaux dans l'aspect de ces choses, auparavant siordinaires pour elle. Mille pensees confuses naissaient dans son ame, ety croissaient a mesure que croissaient au dehors les rayons du soleil.Elle eut enfin ce mouvement de plaisir vague, inexplicable, quienveloppe l'etre moral, comme un nuage envelopperait l'etre physique.Ses reflexions s'accordaient avec les details de ce singulier paysage,et les harmonies de son coeur firent alliance avec les harmonies de lanature. Quand le soleil atteignit un pan de mur, d'ou tombaient desCheveux de Venus aux feuilles epaisses a couleurs changeantes comme lagorge des pigeons, de celestes rayons d'esperance illuminerent l'avenirpour Eugenie, qui desormais se plut a regarder ce pan de mur, ses fleurspales, ses clochettes bleues et ses herbes fanees, auxquelles se mela unsouvenir gracieux comme ceux de l'enfance. Le bruit que chaque feuilleproduisait dans cette cour sonore, en se detachant de son rameau,donnait une reponse aux secretes interrogations de la jeune fille, quiserait restee la, pendant toute la journee, sans s'apercevoir de lafuite des heures. Puis vinrent de tumultueux mouvements d'ame. Elle seleva frequemment, se mit devant son miroir, et s'y regarda comme unauteur de bonne foi contemple son oeuvre pour se critiquer, et se diredes injures a lui-meme.--Je ne suis pas assez belle pour lui. Telle etait la pensee d'Eugenie,pensee humble et fertile en souffrances. La pauvre fille ne se rendaitpas justice; mais la modestie, ou mieux la crainte, est une despremieres vertus de l'amour. Eugenie appartenait bien a ce typed'enfants fortement constitues, comme ils le sont dans la petitebourgeoisie, et dont les beautes paraissent vulgaires; mais si elleressemblait a Venus de Milo, ses formes etaient ennoblies par cettesuavite du sentiment chretien qui purifie la femme et lui donne unedistinction inconnue aux sculpteurs anciens. Elle avait une tete enorme,le front masculin mais delicat du Jupiter de Phidias, et des yeux grisauxquels sa chaste vie, en s'y portant tout entiere, imprimait unelumiere jaillissante. Les traits de son visage rond, jadis frais etrose, avaient ete grossis par une petite verole assez clemente pour n'ypoint laisser de traces, mais qui avait detruit le veloute de la peau,neanmoins si douce et si fine encore que le pur baiser de sa mere ytracait passagerement une marque rouge. Son nez etait un peu trop fort,mais il s'harmoniait avec une bouche d'un rouge de minium, dont leslevres a mille raies etaient pleines d'amour et de bonte. Le col avaitune rondeur parfaite. Le corsage bombe, soigneusement voile, attirait leregard et faisait rever; il manquait sans doute un peu de la grace duea la toilette; mais, pour les connaisseurs, la non-flexibilite de cettehaute taille devait etre un charme. Eugenie, grande et forte, n'avaitdonc rien du joli qui plait aux masses; mais elle etait belle de cettebeaute si facile a reconnaitre, et dont s'eprennent seulement lesartistes. Le peintre qui cherche ici-bas un type a la celeste purete deMarie, qui demande a toute la nature feminine ces yeux modestement fiersdevines par Raphael, ces lignes vierges que donne parfois la nature,mais qu'une vie chretienne et pudique peut seule conserver ou faireacquerir; ce peintre, amoureux d'un si rare modele, eut trouve tout acoup dans le visage d'Eugenie la noblesse innee qui s'ignore; il eut vusous un front calme un monde d'amour; et, dans la coupe des yeux, dansl'habitude des paupieres, le je ne sais quoi divin. Ses traits, lescontours de sa tete que l'expression du plaisir n'avait jamais nialteres ni fatigues, ressemblaient aux lignes d'horizon si doucementtranchees dans le lointain des lacs tranquilles. Cette physionomiecalme, coloree, bordee de lueur comme une jolie fleur eclose, reposaitl'ame, communiquait le charme de la conscience qui s'y refletait, etcommandait le regard. Eugenie etait encore sur la rive de la vie oufleurissent les illusions enfantines, ou se cueillent les margueritesavec des delices plus tard inconnues. Aussi se dit-elle en se mirant,sans savoir encore ce qu'etait l'amour:--Je suis trop laide, il ne fera pas attention a moi.Puis elle ouvrit la porte de sa chambre qui donnait sur l'escalier, ettendit le cou pour ecouter les bruits de la maison.--Il ne se leve pas, pensa-t-elle en entendant la tousserie matinale deNanon, et la bonne fille allant, venant, balayant la salle, allumant sonfeu, enchainant le chien et parlant a ses betes dans l'ecurie. AussitotEugenie descendit et courut a Nanon qui trayait la vache.--Nanon, ma bonne Nanon, fais donc de la creme pour le cafe de moncousin.--Mais, mademoiselle, il aurait fallu s'y prendre hier, dit Nanon quipartit d'un gros eclat de rire. Je ne peux pas faire de la creme. Votrecousin est mignon, mignon, mais vraiment mignon. Vous ne l'avez pas vudans sa chambrelouque de soie et d'or. Je l'ai vu, moi. Il porte dulinge fin comme celui du surplis a monsieur le cure.--Nanon, fais-nous donc de la galette.--Et qui me donnera du bois pour le four, et de la farine, et du beurre?dit Nanon laquelle en sa qualite de premier ministre de Grandetprenait parfois une importance enorme aux yeux d'Eugenie et de sa mere.Faut-il pas le voler, cet homme, pour feter votre cousin? Demandez-luidu beurre, de la farine, du bois, il est votre pere, il peut vous endonner. Tenez, le voila qui descend pour voir aux provisions ...Eugenie se sauva dans le jardin, tout epouvantee en entendant tremblerl'escalier sous le pas de son pere. Elle eprouvait deja les effets decette profonde pudeur et de cette conscience particuliere de notrebonheur qui nous fait croire, non sans raison peut-etre, que nos penseessont gravees sur notre front et sautent aux yeux d'autrui. Ens'apercevant enfin du froid denuement de la maison paternelle, la pauvrefille concevait une sorte de depit de ne pouvoir la mettre en harmonieavec l'elegance de son cousin. Elle eprouva un besoin passionne de fairequelque chose pour lui; quoi? elle n'en savait rien. Naive et vraie,elle se laissait aller a sa nature angelique sans se defier ni de sesimpressions, ni de ses sentiments. Le seul aspect de son cousin avaiteveille chez elle les penchants naturels de la femme, et ils durent sedeployer d'autant plus vivement, qu'ayant atteint sa vingt-troisiemeannee, elle se trouvait dans la plenitude de son intelligence et de sesdesirs. Pour la premiere fois, elle eut dans le coeur de la terreur al'aspect de son pere, vit en lui le maitre de son sort, et se crutcoupable d'une faute en lui taisant quelques pensees. Elle se mit amarcher a pas precipites en s'etonnant de respirer un air plus pur, desentir les rayons du soleil plus vivifiants, et d'y puiser une chaleurmorale, une vie nouvelle. Pendant qu'elle cherchait un artifice pourobtenir la galette, il s'elevait entre la Grande Nanon et Grandet une deces querelles aussi rares entre eux que le sont les hirondelles enhiver. Muni de ses clefs, le bonhomme etait venu pour mesurer les vivresnecessaires a la consommation de la journee.--Reste-t-il du pain d'hier? dit-il a Nanon.--Pas une miette, monsieur.Grandet prit un gros pain rond, bien enfarine, moule dans un de cespaniers plats qui servent a boulanger en Anjou, et il allait le couper,quand Nanon lui dit:--Nous sommes cinq, aujourd'hui, monsieur.--C'est vrai, repondit Grandet, mais ton pain pese six livres, il enrestera. D'ailleurs, ces jeunes gens de Paris, tu verras que ca ne mangepoint de pain.--Ca mangera donc de la _frippe_, dit Nanon.En Anjou, la frippe, mot du lexique populaire, exprime l'accompagnementdu pain, depuis le beurre etendu sur la tartine, frippe vulgaire,jusqu'aux confitures d'alleberge, la plus distinguee des frippes; ettous ceux qui, dans leur enfance, ont leche la frippe et laisse le pain,comprendront la portee de cette locution.--Non, repondit Grandet, ca ne mange ni frippe, ni pain. Ils sontquasiment comme des filles a marier.Enfin, apres avoir parcimonieusement ordonne le menu quotidien, lebonhomme allait se diriger vers son fruitier, en fermant neanmoins lesarmoires de sa _Depense_, lorsque Nanon l'arreta pour lui dire:--Monsieur, donnez-moi donc alors de la farine et du beurre, je feraiune galette aux enfants.--Ne vas-tu pas mettre la maison au pillage a cause de mon neveu?--Je ne pensais pas plus a votre neveu qu'a votre chien, pas plus quevous n'y pensez vous-meme. Ne voila-t-il pas que vous ne m'avez _aveint_que six morceaux de sucre, m'en faut huit.--Ha! ca, Nanon, je ne t'ai jamais vue comme ca. Qu'est-ce qui te passedonc par la tete? Es-tu la maitresse ici? Tu n'auras que six morceauxde sucre.--Eh! bien, votre neveu, avec quoi donc qu'il sucrera son cafe?--Avec deux morceaux, je m'en passerai, moi.--Vous vous passerez de sucre, a votre age! J'aimerais mieux vous enacheter de ma poche.--Mele-toi de ce qui te regarde.Malgre la baisse du prix, le sucre etait toujours, aux yeux dutonnelier, la plus precieuse des denrees coloniales, il valait toujourssix francs la livre, pour lui. L'obligation de le menager, prise sousl'Empire, etait devenue la plus indelebile de ses habitudes. Toutes lesfemmes, meme la plus niaise, savent ruser pour arriver a leurs fins,Nanon abandonna la question du sucre pour obtenir la galette.--Mademoiselle, cria-t-elle par la croisee, est-ce pas que vous voulezde la galette?--Non, non, repondit Eugenie.--Allons, Nanon, dit Grandet en entendant la voix de sa fille, tiens. Ilouvrit la _mette_ ou etait la farine, lui en donna une mesure, et ajoutaquelques onces de beurre au morceau qu'il avait deja coupe.--Il faudra du bois pour chauffer le four, dit l'implacable Nanon.--Eh! bien, tu en prendras a ta suffisance, repondit-ilmelancoliquement, mais alors tu nous feras une tarte aux fruits, et tunous cuiras au four tout le diner; par ainsi, tu n'allumeras pas deuxfeux.--Quien! s'ecria Nanon, vous n'avez pas besoin de me le dire. Grandetjeta sur son fidele ministre un coup d'oeil presque paternel.--Mademoiselle, cria la cuisiniere, nous aurons une galette. Le pereGrandet revint charge de ses fruits, et en rangea une premiere assietteesur la table de la cuisine.--Voyez donc, monsieur, lui dit Nanon, les jolies bottes qu'a votreneveu. Quel cuir, et qui sent bon. Avec quoi que ca se nettoie donc?Faut-il y mettre de votre cirage a l'oeuf?--Nanon, je crois que l'oeuf gaterait ce cuir-la. D'ailleurs, dis-lui quetu ne connais point la maniere de cirer le maroquin, oui, c'est dumaroquin, il achetera lui-meme a Saumur et t'apportera de quoi illustrerses bottes. J'ai entendu dire qu'on fourre du sucre dans leur ciragepour le rendre brillant.--C'est donc bon a manger, dit la servante en portant les bottes a sonnez. Tiens, tiens, elles sentent l'eau de Cologne de madame. Ah!c'est-il drole.--Drole! dit le maitre, tu trouves drole de mettre a des bottes plusd'argent que n'en vaut celui qui les porte.--Monsieur, dit-elle au second voyage de son maitre qui avait ferme lefruitier, est-ce que vous ne mettrez pas une ou deux fois le pot-au-feupar semaine a cause de votre ...?--Oui.--Faudra que j'aille a la boucherie.--Pas du tout; tu nous feras du bouillon de volaille, les fermiers net'en laisseront pas chomer. Mais je vais dire a Cornoiller de me tuerdes corbeaux. Ce gibier-la donne le meilleur bouillon de la terre.--C'est-y vrai, monsieur, que ca mange les morts?--Tu es bete, Nanon! ils mangent, comme tout le monde, ce qu'ilstrouvent. Est-ce que nous ne vivons pas des morts? Qu'est-ce donc queles successions? Le pere Grandet n'ayant plus d'ordre a donner, tira samontre; et voyant qu'il pouvait encore disposer d'une demi-heure avantle dejeuner, il prit son chapeau, vint embrasser sa fille, et lui dit:--Veux-tu te promener au bord de la Loire sur mes prairies? j'aiquelque chose a y faire.Eugenie alla mettre son chapeau de paille cousue, double de taffetasrose; puis, le pere et la fille descendirent la rue tortueuse jusqu'ala place.--Ou devalez-vous donc si matin? dit le notaire Cruchot qui rencontraGrandet.--Voir quelque chose, repondit le bonhomme sans etre la dupe de lapromenade matinale de son ami.Quand le pere Grandet allait voir quelque chose, le notaire savait parexperience qu'il y avait toujours quelque chose a gagner avec lui. Doncil l'accompagna.--Venez, Cruchot? dit Grandet au notaire. Vous etes de mes amis, jevais vous demontrer comme quoi c'est une betise de planter des peupliersdans de bonnes terres ...--Vous comptez donc pour rien les soixante mille francs que vous avezpalpes pour ceux qui etaient dans vos prairies de la Loire, dit maitreCruchot en ouvrant des yeux hebetes. Avez-vous eu du bonheur?... Coupervos arbres au moment ou l'on manquait de bois blanc a Nantes, et lesvendre trente francs!Eugenie ecoutait sans savoir qu'elle touchait au moment le plus solennelde sa vie, et que le notaire allait faire prononcer sur elle un arretpaternel et souverain. Grandet etait arrive aux magnifiques prairiesqu'il possedait au bord de la Loire, et ou trente ouvriers s'occupaienta deblayer, combler, niveler les emplacements autrefois pris par lespeupliers.--Maitre Cruchot, voyez ce qu'un peuplier prend de terrain, dit-il aunotaire. Jean, cria-t-il a un ouvrier, me ... me ... mesure avec ta toisedans tou ... t ou ... tous les sens?--Quatre fois huit pieds, repondit l'ouvrier apres avoir fini.--Trente-deux pieds de perte, dit Grandet a Cruchot. J'avais sur cetteligne trois cents peupliers, pas vrai? Or ... trois ce ... ce ... ce ...cent fois trente-d ... eux pie ... pieds me man ... man ... man ...mangeaient cinq ... inq cents de foin; ajoutez deux fois autant sur lescotes, quinze cents; les rangees du milieu autant. Alors, me ... me ...mettons mille bottes de foin.--Eh! bien, dit Cruchot pour aider son ami, mille bottes de ce foin-lavalent environ six cents francs.--Di ... di ... dites dou ... ou ... onze cents a cause des trois a quatrecents francs de regain. Eh! bien, ca ... ca ... ca ... calculez ce que queque dou ... Onze cents francs par an ... pen ... pendant quarante ans do... donnent a ... a ... avec les in ... in ... interets com ... com ...composes que que que vouous saaavez.--Va pour soixante mille francs, dit le notaire.--Je le veux bien! ca ne ne ne fera que que que soixante mille francs.Eh! bien, reprit le vigneron sans begayer, deux mille peupliers dequarante ans ne me donneraient pas cinquante mille francs. Il y a perte.J'ai trouve ca, moi, dit Grandet en se dressant sur ses ergots. Jean,reprit-il, tu combleras les trous, excepte du cote de la Loire, ou tuplanteras les peupliers que j'ai achetes. En les mettant dans lariviere, ils se nourriront aux frais du gouvernement, ajouta-t-il ense tournant vers Cruchot et imprimant a la loupe de son nez un legermouvement qui valait le plus ironique des sourires.--Cela est clair: les peupliers ne doivent se planter que sur lesterres maigres, dit Cruchot stupefait par les calculs de Grandet.--_O-u-i, monsieur_, repondit ironiquement le tonnelier.Eugenie, qui regardait le sublime paysage de la Loire sans ecouter lescalculs de son pere, preta bientot l'oreille aux discours de Cruchot enl'entendant dire a son client:--He! bien, vous avez fait venir un gendre de Paris, il n'est questionque de votre neveu dans tout Saumur. Je vais bientot avoir un contrat adresser, pere Grandet.--Vous ... ou ... vous etes so ... so ... orti de bo ... bonne heurepooour me dire ca, reprit Grandet en accompagnant cette reflexion d'unmouvement de sa loupe. He! bien, mon vieux camaaaarade, je serai franc,et je vous dirai ce que vooous voooulez sa savoir. J'aimerais mieux,voyez-vooous, je ... jeter ma fi ... fi fille dans la Loire que de ladooonner a son cououousin: vous pou ... pou ... ouvez aaannoncer ca.Mais non, laissez jaaser le le mon ... onde.Cette reponse causa des eblouissements a Eugenie. Les lointainesesperances qui pour elle commencaient a poindre dans son coeur fleurirentsoudain, se realiserent et formerent un faisceau de fleurs qu'elle vitcoupees et gisant a terre. Depuis la veille, elle s'attachait a Charlespar tous les liens de bonheur qui unissent les ames; desormais lasouffrance allait donc les corroborer. N'est-il pas dans la nobledestinee de la femme d'etre plus touchee des pompes de la misere que dessplendeurs de la fortune? Comment le sentiment paternel avait-il pus'eteindre au fond du coeur de son pere? de quel crime Charles etait-ildonc coupable? Questions mysterieuses! Deja son amour naissant,mystere si profond, s'enveloppait de mysteres. Elle revint tremblant surses jambes, et en arrivant a la vieille rue sombre, si joyeuse pourelle, elle la trouva d'un aspect triste, elle y respira la melancolieque les temps et les choses y avaient imprimee. Aucun des enseignementsde l'amour ne lui manquait. A quelques pas du logis, elle devanca sonpere et l'attendit a la porte apres y avoir frappe. Mais Grandet, quivoyait dans la main du notaire un journal encore sous bande, lui avaitdit:--Ou en sont les fonds?--Vous ne voulez pas m'ecouter, Grandet, lui repondit Cruchot.Achetez-en vite, il y a encore vingt pour cent a gagner en deux ans,outre les interets a un excellent taux, cinq mille livres de rente pourquatre-vingt mille francs. Les fonds sont a quatre-vingts francscinquante centimes.--Nous verrons cela, repondit Grandet en se frottant le menton.--Mon Dieu! dit le notaire.--He! bien, quoi? s'ecria Grandet au moment ou Cruchot lui mettait lejournal sous les yeux en lui disant:--Lisez cet article._Monsieur Grandet, l'un des negociants les plus estimes de Paris, s'estbrule la cervelle hier apres avoir fait son apparition accoutumee a laBourse. Il avait envoye au president de la Chambre des Deputes sademission, et s'etait egalement demis de ses fonctions de juge autribunal de commerce. La faillite de messieurs Roguin et Souchet, sonagent de change et son notaire, l'ont ruine. La consideration dontjouissait monsieur Grandet et son credit etaient neanmoins tels qu'ileut sans doute trouve des secours sur la place de Paris. Il est aregretter que cet homme honorable ait cede a un premier moment dedesespoir, etc_.--Je le savais, dit le vieux vigneron au notaire.Ce mot glaca maitre Cruchot, qui, malgre son impassibilite de notaire,se sentit froid dans le dos en pensant que le Grandet de Paris avaitpeut-etre implore vainement les millions du Grandet de Saumur.--Et son fils, si joyeux hier ...--Il ne sait rien encore, repondit Grandet avec le meme calme.--Adieu, monsieur Grandet, dit Cruchot qui comprit tout et alla rassurerle president de Bonfons.En entrant, Grandet trouva le dejeuner pret. Madame Grandet, au cou delaquelle Eugenie sauta pour l'embrasser avec cette vive effusion de coeurque nous cause un chagrin secret, etait deja sur son siege a patins, etse tricotait des manches pour l'hiver.--Vous pouvez manger, dit Nanon qui descendit les escaliers quatre aquatre, l'enfant dort comme un cherubin. Qu'il est gentil les yeuxfermes! Je suis entree, je l'ai appele. Ah bien oui! personne.--Laisse-le dormir, dit Grandet, il s'eveillera toujours assez totaujourd'hui pour apprendre de mauvaises nouvelles.--Qu'y a-t-il donc? demanda Eugenie en mettant dans son cafe les deuxpetits morceaux de sucre pesant on ne sait combien de grammes que lebonhomme s'amusait a couper lui-meme a ses heures perdues. MadameGrandet, qui n'avait pas ose faire cette question, regarda son mari.--Son pere s'est brule la cervelle.--Mon oncle?... dit Eugenie.--Le pauvre jeune homme! s'ecria madame Grandet.--Oui, pauvre, reprit Grandet, il ne possede pas un sou.--He! ben, il dort comme s'il etait le roi de la terre, dit Nanon d'unaccent doux.Eugenie cessa de manger. Son coeur se serra, comme il se serre quand,pour la premiere fois, la compassion, excitee par le malheur de celuiqu'elle aime, s'epanche dans le corps entier d'une femme. La pauvrefille pleura.--Tu ne connaissais pas ton oncle, pourquoi pleures-tu? lui dit sonpere en lui lancant un de ces regards de tigre affame qu'il jetait sansdoute a ses tas d'or.--Mais, monsieur, dit la servante, qui ne se sentirait pas de pitie pource pauvre jeune homme qui dort comme un sabot sans savoir son sort?--Je ne te parle pas, Nanon! tiens ta langue.Eugenie apprit en ce moment que la femme qui aime doit toujoursdissimuler ses sentiments. Elle ne repondit pas.--Jusqu'a mon retour, vous ne lui parlerez de rien, j'espere, m'ameGrandet, dit le vieillard en continuant. Je suis oblige d'aller fairealigner le fosse de mes pres sur la route. Je serai revenu a midi pourle second dejeuner, et je causerai avec mon neveu de ses affaires. Quanta toi, mademoiselle Eugenie, si c'est pour ce mirliflor que tu pleures,assez comme cela, mon enfant. Il partira, d'arre d'arre, pour lesgrandes Indes. Tu ne le verras plus ...Le pere prit ses gants au bord de son chapeau, les mit avec son calmehabituel, les assujettit en s'emmortaisant les doigts les uns dans lesautres, et sortit.--Ah! maman, j'etouffe, s'ecria Eugenie quand elle fut seule avec samere. Je n'ai jamais souffert ainsi. Madame Grandet, voyant sa fillepalir, ouvrit la croisee et lui fit respirer le grand air.--Je suis mieux, dit Eugenie apres un moment.Cette emotion nerveuse chez une nature jusqu'alors en apparence calme etfroide reagit sur madame Grandet, qui regarda sa fille avec cetteintuition sympathique dont sont douees les meres pour l'objet de leurtendresse, et devina tout. Mais, a la verite, la vie des celebres soeurshongroises, attachees l'une a l'autre par une erreur de la nature,n'avait pas ete plus intime que ne l'etait celle d'Eugenie et de samere, toujours ensemble dans cette embrasure de croisee, ensemble al'eglise, et dormant ensemble dans le meme air.--Ma pauvre enfant! dit madame Grandet en prenant la tete d'Eugeniepour l'appuyer contre son sein.A ces mots, la jeune fille releva la tete, interrogea sa mere par unregard, en scruta les secretes pensees, et lui dit:--Pourquoi l'envoyer aux Indes? S'il est malheureux, ne doit-il pasrester ici, n'est-il pas notre plus proche parent?--Oui, mon enfant, ce serait bien naturel; mais ton pere a ses raisons,nous devons les respecter.La mere et la fille s'assirent en silence, l'une sur sa chaise a patins,l'autre sur son petit fauteuil; et, toutes deux, elles reprirent leurouvrage. Oppressee de reconnaissance pour l'admirable entente de coeurque lui avait temoignee sa mere, Eugenie lui baisa la main en disant:--Combien tu es bonne, ma chere maman!Ces paroles firent rayonner le vieux visage maternel, fletri par delongues douleurs.--Le trouves-tu bien? demanda Eugenie.Madame Grandet ne repondit que par un sourire; puis, apres un moment desilence, elle dit a voix basse:--L'aimerais-tu donc deja? ce serait mal.--Mal, reprit Eugenie, pourquoi? Il te plait, il plait a Nanon,pourquoi ne me plairait-il pas? Tiens, maman, mettons la table pour sondejeuner. Elle jeta son ouvrage, la mere en fit autant en lui disant:--Tu es folle! Mais elle se plut a justifier la folie de sa fille en lapartageant. Eugenie appela Nanon.--Quoi que vous voulez encore, mademoiselle?--Nanon, tu auras bien de la creme pour midi.--Ah! pour midi, oui, repondit la vieille servante.--He! bien, donne-lui du cafe bien fort, j'ai entendu dire a monsieurdes Grassins que le cafe se faisait bien fort a Paris. Mets-en beaucoup.--Et ou voulez-vous que j'en prenne?--Achetes-en.--Et si monsieur me rencontre?--Il est a ses pres.--Je cours. Mais monsieur Fessard m'a deja demande si les trois Magesetaient chez nous, en me donnant de la bougie. Toute la ville va savoirnos deportements.--Si ton pere s'apercoit de quelque chose, dit madame Grandet, il estcapable de nous battre.--Eh! bien, il nous battra, nous recevrons ses coups a genoux.Madame Grandet leva les yeux au ciel, pour toute reponse. Nanon prit sacoiffe et sortit. Eugenie donna du linge blanc, elle alla chercherquelques-unes des grappes de raisin qu'elle s'etait amusee a etendre surdes cordes dans le grenier; elle marcha legerement le long du corridorpour ne point eveiller son cousin, et ne put s'empecher d'ecouter a saporte la respiration qui s'echappait en temps egaux de ses levres.--Le malheur veille pendant qu'il dort, se dit-elle. Elle prit les plusvertes feuilles de la vigne, arrangea son raisin aussi coquettement quel'aurait pu dresser un vieux chef d'office, et l'apporta triomphalementsur la table. Elle fit main basse, dans la cuisine, sur les poirescomptees par son pere, et les disposa en pyramide parmi des feuilles.Elle allait, venait, trottait, sautait. Elle aurait bien voulu mettre asac toute la maison de son pere; mais il avait les clefs de tout. Nanonrevint avec deux oeufs frais. En voyant les oeufs, Eugenie eut l'envie delui sauter au cou.--Le fermier de la Lande en avait dans son panier, je les lui aidemandes, et il me les a donnes pour m'etre agreable, le mignon.Apres deux heures de soins, pendant lesquelles Eugenie quitta vingt foisson ouvrage pour aller voir bouillir le cafe, pour aller ecouter lebruit que faisait son cousin en se levant, elle reussit a preparer undejeuner tres simple, peu couteux, mais qui derogeait terriblement auxhabitudes inveterees de la maison. Le dejeuner de midi s'y faisaitdebout. Chacun prenait un peu de pain, un fruit ou du beurre, et unverre de vin. En voyant la table placee aupres du feu, l'un desfauteuils mis devant le couvert de son cousin, en voyant les deuxassiettees de fruits, le coquetier, la bouteille de vin blanc, le pain,et le sucre amoncele dans une soucoupe, Eugenie trembla de tous sesmembres en songeant seulement alors aux regards que lui lancerait sonpere, s'il venait a entrer en ce moment. Aussi regardait-elle souvent lapendule, afin de calculer si son cousin pourrait dejeuner avant leretour du bonhomme.--Sois tranquille, Eugenie, si ton pere vient, je prendrai tout sur moi,dit madame Grandet.Eugenie ne put retenir une larme.--Oh! ma bonne mere, s'ecria-t-elle, je ne t'ai pas assez aimee!Charles, apres avoir fait mille tours dans sa chambre en chanteronnant,descendit enfin. Heureusement, il n'etait encore que onze heures. Leparisien! il avait mis autant de coquetterie a sa toilette que s'il sefut trouve au chateau de la noble dame qui voyageait en Ecosse. Il entrade cet air affable et riant qui sied si bien a la jeunesse, et qui causaune joie triste a Eugenie. Il avait pris en plaisanterie le desastre deses chateaux en Anjou, et aborda sa tante fort gaiement.--Avez-vous bien passe la nuit, ma chere tante? Et vous, ma cousine?--Bien, monsieur, mais vous? dit madame Grandet.--Moi, parfaitement.--Vous devez avoir faim, mon cousin, dit Eugenie; mettez-vous a table.--Mais je ne dejeune jamais avant midi, le moment ou je me leve.Cependant, j'ai si mal vecu en route, que je me laisserai faire.D'ailleurs ... Il tira la plus delicieuse montre plate que Breguet aitfaite. Tiens, mais il est onze heures, j'ai ete matinal.--Matinal?... dit madame Grandet.--Oui, mais je voulais ranger mes affaires. Eh! bien, je mangeraisvolontiers quelque chose, un rien, une volaille, un perdreau.--Sainte Vierge! cria Nanon en entendant ces paroles.--Un perdreau, se disait Eugenie qui aurai voulu payer un perdreau detout son pecule.--Venez vous asseoir, lui dit sa tante.Le dandy se laissa aller sur le fauteuil comme une jolie femme qui sepose sur son divan. Eugenie et sa mere prirent des chaises et se mirentpres de lui devant le feu.--Vous vivez toujours ici? leur dit Charles en trouvant la salle encoreplus laide au jour qu'elle ne l'etait aux lumieres.--Toujours, repondit Eugenie en le regardant, excepte pendant lesvendanges. Nous allons alors aider Nanon, et logeons tous a l'abbaye deNoyers.--Vous ne vous promenez jamais?--Quelquefois le dimanche apres vepres, quand il fait beau, dit madameGrandet, nous allons sur le pont, ou voir les foins quand on les fauche.--Avez-vous un theatre?--Aller au spectacle, s'ecria madame Grandet, voir des comediens! Mais,monsieur, ne savez-vous pas que c'est un peche mortel?--Tenez, mon cher monsieur, dit Nanon en apportant les oeufs, nous vousdonnerons les poulets a la coque.--Oh! des oeufs frais, dit Charles qui semblable aux gens habitues auluxe ne pensait deja plus a son perdreau. Mais c'est delicieux, si vousaviez du beurre? Hein, ma chere enfant.--Ah! du beurre! Vous n'aurez donc pas de galette, dit la servante.--Mais donne du beurre, Nanon! s'ecria Eugenie.La jeune fille examinait son cousin coupant ses mouillettes et y prenaitplaisir, autant que la plus sensible grisette de Paris en prend a voirjouer un melodrame ou triomphe l'innocence. Il est vrai que Charles,eleve par une mere gracieuse, perfectionne par une femme a la mode,avait des mouvements coquets, elegants, menus, comme le sont ceux d'unepetite maitresse. La compatissance et la tendresse d'une jeune fillepossedent une influence vraiment magnetique. Aussi Charles, en se voyantl'objet des attentions de sa cousine et de sa tante, ne put-il sesoustraire a l'influence des sentiments qui se dirigeaient vers lui enl'inondant pour ainsi dire. Il jeta sur Eugenie un de ces regardsbrillants de bonte, de caresses, un regard qui semblait sourire. Ils'apercut, en contemplant Eugenie, de l'exquise harmonie des traits dece pur visage, de son innocente attitude, de la clarte magique de sesyeux ou scintillaient de jeunes pensees d'amour, et ou le desir ignoraitla volupte.--Ma foi, ma chere cousine, si vous etiez en grande loge et en grandetoilette a l'Opera, je vous garantis que ma tante aurait bien raison,vous y feriez faire bien des peches d'envie aux hommes et de jalousieaux femmes.Ce compliment etreignit le coeur d'Eugenie, et le fit palpiter de joie,quoiqu'elle n'y comprit rien.--Oh! mon cousin, vous voulez vous moquer d'une pauvre petiteprovinciale.--Si vous me connaissiez, ma cousine, vous sauriez que j'abhorre laraillerie, elle fletrit le coeur, froisse tous les sentiments ... Et ilgoba fort agreablement sa mouillette beurree. Non, je n'ai probablementpas assez d'esprit pour me moquer des autres, et ce defaut me faitbeaucoup de tort. A Paris, on trouve moyen de vous assassiner un hommeen disant: Il a bon coeur. Cette phrase veut dire: Le pauvre garcon estbete comme un rhinoceros. Mais comme je suis riche et connu pour abattreune poupee du premier coup a trente pas avec toute espece de pistolet eten plein champ, la raillerie me respecte.--Ce que vous dites, mon neveu, annonce un bon coeur.--Vous avez une bien jolie bague, dit Eugenie, est-ce mal de vousdemander a la voir?Charles tendit la main en defaisant son anneau, et Eugenie rougit eneffleurant du bout de ses doigts les ongles roses de son cousin.--Voyez, ma mere, le beau travail.--Oh! il y a gros d'or, dit Nanon en apportant le cafe.--Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela? demanda Charles en riant.Et il montrait un pot oblong, en terre brune, verni, faience al'interieur, borde d'une frange de cendre, et au fond duquel tombait lecafe en revenant a la surface du liquide bouillonnant.--C'est du cafe boullu, dit Nanon.--Ah! ma chere tante, je laisserai du moins quelque trace bienfaisantede mon passage ici. Vous etes bien arrieres! Je vous apprendrai a fairedu bon cafe dans une cafetiere a la Chaptal.Il tenta d'expliquer le systeme de la cafetiere a la Chaptal.--Ah! bien, s'il y a tant d'affaires que ca, dit Manon, il faudraitbien y passer sa vie. Jamais je ne ferai de cafe comme ca. Ah! bien,oui. Et qui est-ce qui ferait de l'herbe pour notre vache pendant que jeferais le cafe?--C'est moi qui le ferai, dit Eugenie.--Enfant, dit madame Grandet en regardant sa fille.A ce mot, qui rappelait le chagrin pres de fondre sur ce malheureuxjeune homme, les trois femmes se turent et le contemplerent d'un air decommiseration qui le frappa.--Qu'avez-vous donc, ma cousine?--Chut! dit madame Grandet a Eugenie qui allait parler. Tu sais, mafille, que ton pere s'est charge de parler a monsieur ...--Dites Charles, dit le jeune Grandet.--Ah! vous vous nommez Charles? C'est un beau nom, s'ecria Eugenie.Les malheurs pressentis arrivent presque toujours. La, Nanon, madameGrandet et Eugenie, qui ne pensaient pas sans frisson au retour du vieuxtonnelier, entendirent un coup de marteau dont le retentissement leuretait bien connu.--Voila papa, dit Eugenie.Elle ota la soucoupe au sucre, en en laissant quelques morceaux sur lanappe. Nanon emporta l'assiette aux oeufs. Madame Grandet se dressa commeune biche effrayee. C'etait une peur panique de laquelle Charles duts'etonner.--Eh! bien, qu'avez-vous donc? leur demanda-t-il.--Mais voila mon pere, dit Eugenie.--Eh! bien?...Monsieur Grandet entra, jeta son regard clair sur la table, sur Charles,il vit tout.--Ah! ah! vous avez fait fete a votre neveu, c'est bien, tres bien,c'est fort bien! dit-il sans begayer. Quand le chat court sur lestoits, les souris dansent sur les planchers.--Fete?... se dit Charles incapable de soupconner le regime et les moeursde cette maison.--Donne-moi mon verre, Nanon? dit le bonhomme.Eugenie apporta le verre. Grandet tira de son gousset un couteau decorne a grosse lame, coupa une tartine, prit un peu de beurre, l'etenditsoigneusement et se mit a manger debout. En ce moment, Charles sucraitson cafe. Le pere Grandet apercut les morceaux de sucre, examina safemme qui palit, et fit trois pas; il se pencha vers l'oreille de lapauvre vieille, et lui dit:--Ou donc avez-vous pris tout ce sucre?--Nanon est allee en chercher chez Fessard, il n'y en avait pas.Il est impossible de se figurer l'interet profond que cette scene muetteoffrait a ces trois femmes: Nanon avait quitte sa cuisine et regardaitdans la salle pour voir comment les choses s'y passeraient. Charlesayant goute son cafe, le trouva trop amer et chercha le sucre queGrandet avait deja serre.--Que voulez-vous, mon neveu? lui dit le bonhomme.--Le sucre.--Mettez du lait, repondit le maitre de la maison, votre cafes'adoucira.Eugenie reprit la soucoupe au sucre que Grandet avait deja serree, et lamit sur la table en contemplant son pere d'un air calme. Certes, laParisienne qui, pour faciliter la fuite de son amant, soutient de sesfaibles bras une echelle de soie, ne montre pas plus de courage que n'endeployait Eugenie en remettant le sucre sur la table. L'amantrecompensera sa Parisienne qui lui fera voir orgueilleusement un beaubras meurtri dont chaque veine fletrie sera baignee de larmes, debaisers, et guerie par le plaisir, tandis que Charles ne devait jamaisetre dans le secret des profondes agitations qui brisaient le coeur de sacousine, alors foudroyee par le regard du vieux tonnelier.--Tu ne manges pas, ma femme?La pauvre ilote s'avanca, coupa piteusement un morceau de pain, et pritune poire. Eugenie offrit audacieusement a son pere du raisin, en luidisant:--Goute donc a ma conserve, papa! Mon cousin, vous en mangerez,n'est-ce pas? Je suis allee chercher ces jolies grappes-la pour vous.--Oh! si on ne les arrete, elles mettront Saumur au pillage pour vous,mon neveu. Quand vous aurez fini, nous irons ensemble dans le jardin,j'ai a vous dire des choses qui ne sont pas sucrees.Eugenie et sa mere lancerent un regard sur Charles a l'expression duquelle jeune homme ne put se tromper.--Qu'est-ce que ces mots signifient, mon oncle? Depuis la mort de mapauvre mere ... (a ces deux mots, sa voix mollit) il n'y a pas de malheurpossible pour moi ...--Mon neveu, qui peut connaitre les afflictions par lesquelles Dieu veutnous eprouver? lui dit sa tante.--Ta! ta! ta! ta! dit Grandet, voila les betises qui commencent. Jevois avec peine, mon neveu, vos jolies mains blanches. Il lui montra lesespeces d'epaules de mouton que la nature lui avait mises au bout desbras. Voila des mains faites pour ramasser des ecus! Vous avez eteeleve a mettre vos pieds dans la peau avec laquelle se fabriquent lesportefeuilles ou nous serrons les billets de banque. Mauvais! mauvais!--Que voulez-vous dire, mon oncle, je veux etre pendu si je comprends unseul mot.--Venez, dit Grandet. L'avare fit claquer la lame de son couteau, but lereste de son vin blanc et ouvrit la porte.--Mon cousin, ayez du courage!L'accent de la jeune fille avait glace Charles, qui suivit son terribleparent en proie a de mortelles inquietudes. Eugenie, sa mere et Nanonvinrent dans la cuisine, excitees par une invincible curiosite a epierles deux acteurs de la scene qui allait se passer dans le petit jardinhumide ou l'oncle marcha d'abord silencieusement avec le neveu. Grandetn'etait pas embarrasse pour apprendre a Charles la mort de son pere,mais il eprouvait une sorte de compassion en le sachant sans un sou, etil cherchait des formules pour adoucir l'expression de cette cruelleverite. Vous avez perdu votre pere! ce n'etait rien a dire. Les peresmeurent avant les enfants. Mais: Vous etes sans aucune espece defortune! tous les malheurs de la terre etaient reunis dans ces paroles.Et le bonhomme de faire, pour la troisieme fois, le tour de l'allee dumilieu dont le sable craquait sous les pieds. Dans les grandescirconstances de la vie, notre ame s'attache fortement aux lieux ou lesplaisirs et les chagrins fondent sur nous. Aussi Charles examinait-ilavec une attention particuliere les buis de ce petit jardin, lesfeuilles pales qui tombaient, les degradations des murs, les bizarreriesdes arbres fruitiers, details pittoresques qui devaient rester gravesdans son souvenir, eternellement meles a cette heure supreme, par unemnemotechnie particuliere aux passions.--Il fait bien chaud, bien beau, dit Grandet en aspirant une fortepartie d'air.--Oui, mon oncle, mais pourquoi ...--Eh! bien, mon garcon, reprit l'oncle, j'ai de mauvaises nouvelles at'apprendre. Ton pere est bien mal ...--Pourquoi suis-je ici? dit Charles. Nanon! cria-t-il, des chevaux deposte. Je trouverai bien une voiture dans le pays, ajouta-t-il en setournant vers son oncle qui demeurait immobile.--Les chevaux et la voiture sont inutiles, repondit Grandet. Charlesresta muet, palit et les yeux devinrent fixes.--Oui, mon pauvre garcon, tu devines. Il est mort. Mais ce n'est rien.Il y a quelque chose de plus grave. Il s'est brule la cervelle ...--Mon pere?...--Oui. Mais ce n'est rien. Les journaux glosent de cela comme s'ils enavaient le droit. Tiens, lis.Grandet, qui avait emprunte le journal de Cruchot, mit le fatal articlesous les yeux de Charles. En ce moment le pauvre jeune homme, encoreenfant, encore dans l'age ou les sentiments se produisent avec naivete,fondit en larmes.--Allons, bien, se dit Grandet. Ses yeux m'effrayaient ... Il pleure, levoila sauve. Ce n'est encore rien, mon pauvre neveu, reprit Grandet ahaute voix sans savoir si Charles l'ecoutait, ce n'est rien, tu teconsoleras; mais ...--Jamais! jamais! mon pere! mon pere!--Il t'a ruine, tu es sans argent.--Qu'est-ce que cela me fait! Ou est mon pere, mon pere?Les pleurs et les sanglots retentissaient entre ces murailles d'unehorrible facon et se repercutaient dans les echos. Les trois femmes,saisies de pitie, pleuraient: les larmes sont aussi contagieuses quepeut l'etre le rire. Charles, sans ecouter son oncle, se sauva dans lacour, trouva l'escalier, monta dans sa chambre, et se jeta en traverssur son lit en se mettant la face dans les draps pour pleurer a son aiseloin de ses parents.--Il faut laisser passer la premiere averse, dit Grandet en rentrantdans la salle ou Eugenie et sa mere avaient brusquement repris leursplaces et travaillaient d'une main tremblante apres s'etre essuye lesyeux. Mais ce jeune homme n'est bon a rien, il s'occupe plus des mortsque de l'argent.Eugenie frissonna en entendant son pere s'exprimant ainsi sur la plussainte des douleurs. Des ce moment, elle commenca a juger son pere.Quoique assourdis, les sanglots de Charles retentissaient dans cettesonore maison; et sa plainte profonde, qui semblait sortir de dessousterre, ne cessa que vers le soir, apres s'etre graduellement affaiblie.--Pauvre jeune homme! dit madame Grandet.Fatale exclamation! Le pere Grandet regarda sa femme, Eugenie et lesucrier; il se souvint du dejeuner extraordinaire apprete pour leparent malheureux, et se posa au milieu de la salle.--Ah! ca, j'espere, dit-il avec son calme habituel, que vous n'allezpas continuer vos prodigalites, madame Grandet. Je ne vous donne pas_mon_ argent pour embucquer de sucre ce jeune drole.--Ma mere n'y est pour rien, dit Eugenie. C'est moi qui ...--Est-ce parce que tu es majeure, reprit Grandet en interrompant safille, que tu voudrais me contrarier? Songe, Eugenie ...--Mon pere, le fils de votre frere ne devait pas manquer chez vous de ...--Ta, ta, ta, ta, dit le tonnelier sur quatre tons chromatiques, le filsde mon frere par-ci, mon neveu par la. Charles ne nous est de rien, iln'a ni sou ni maille; son pere a fait faillite; et, quand ce mirlifloraura pleure son soul, il decampera d'ici; je ne veux pas qu'ilrevolutionne ma maison.--Qu'est-ce que c'est, mon pere, que de faire faillite? demandaEugenie.--Faire faillite, reprit le pere, c'est commettre l'action la plusdeshonorante entre toutes celles qui peuvent deshonorer l'homme.--Ce doit etre un bien grand peche, dit madame Grandet, et notre frereserait damne.--Allons, voila tes litanies, dit-il a sa femme en haussant les epaules.Faire faillite, Eugenie, reprit-il, est un vol que la loi prendmalheureusement sous sa protection. Des gens ont donne leurs denrees aGuillaume Grandet sur sa reputation d'honneur et de probite, puis il atout pris, et ne leur laisse que les yeux pour pleurer. Le voleur degrand chemin est preferable au banqueroutier: celui-la vous attaque,vous pouvez vous defendre, il risque sa tete; mais l'autre ... EnfinCharles est deshonore.Ces mots retentirent dans le coeur de la pauvre fille et y peserent detout leur poids. Probe autant qu'une fleur nee au fond d'une foret estdelicate, elle ne connaissait ni les maximes du monde, ni sesraisonnements captieux, ni ses sophismes: elle accepta donc l'atroceexplication que son pere lui donnait a dessein de la faillite, sans luifaire connaitre la distinction qui existe entre une failliteinvolontaire et une faillite calculee.--Eh! bien, mon pere, vous n'avez donc pu empecher ce malheur?--Mon frere ne m'a pas consulte. D'ailleurs, il doit quatre millions.--Qu'est-ce que c'est donc qu'un million, mon pere? demanda-t-elle avecla naivete d'un enfant qui croit pouvoir trouver promptement ce qu'ildesire.--Deux millions? dit Grandet, mais c'est deux millions de pieces devingt sous, et il faut cinq pieces de vingt sous pour faire cinq francs.--Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! s'ecria Eugenie, comment mon oncle avait-il eu alui quatre millions? Y a-t-il quelque autre personne en France quipuisse avoir autant de millions? (Le pere Grandet se caressait lementon, souriait, et sa loupe semblait se dilater.)--Mais que va devenirmon cousin Charles?--Il va partir pour les Grandes-Indes, ou, selon le voeu de son pere, iltachera de faire fortune.--Mais a-t-il de l'argent pour aller la?--Je lui payerai son voyage ... jusqu'a ... Oui, jusqu'a Nantes.Eugenie sauta d'un bond au cou de son pere.--Ah! mon pere, vous etes bon, vous!Elle l'embrassait de maniere a rendre presque honteux Grandet, que saconscience harcelait un peu.--Faut-il beaucoup de temps pour amasser un million? luidemanda-t-elle.--Dame! dit le tonnelier, tu sais ce que c'est qu'un napoleon.Eh! bien, il en faut cinquante mille pour faire un million.--Maman, nous dirons des neuvaines pour lui.--J'y pensais, repondit la mere.--C'est cela! toujours depenser de l'argent, s'ecria le pere. Ah! ca,croyez-vous donc qu'il y ait des mille et des cent ici?En ce moment une plainte sourde, plus lugubre que toutes les autres,retentit dans les greniers et glaca de terreur Eugenie et sa mere.--Nanon, va voir la-haut s'il ne se tue pas, dit Grandet.--Ha! ca, reprit-il en se tournant vers sa femme et sa fille que sonmot avait rendues pales, pas de betises, vous deux. Je vous laisse. Jevais tourner autour de nos Hollandais, qui s'en vont aujourd'hui. Puisj'irai voir Cruchot et causer avec lui de tout ca.Il partit. Quand Grandet eut tire la porte, Eugenie et sa mererespirerent a leur aise. Avant cette matinee, jamais la fille n'avaitsenti de contrainte en presence de son pere; mais, depuis quelquesheures, elle changeait a tous moments et de sentiments et d'idees.--Maman, pour combien de louis vend-on une piece de vin?--Ton pere vend les siennes entre cent et cent cinquante francs,quelquefois deux cents, a ce que j'ai entendu dire.--Quand il recolte quatorze cents pieces de vin ...--Ma foi, mon enfant, je ne sais pas ce que cela fait; ton pere ne medit jamais ses affaires.--Mais alors papa doit etre riche.--Peut-etre. Mais monsieur Cruchot m'a dit qu'il avait achete Froidfondil y a deux ans. Ca l'aura gene.Eugenie, ne comprenant plus rien a la fortune de son pere, en resta lade ses calculs.--Il ne m'a tant seulement point vue, le mignon! dit Nanon en revenant.Il est etendu comme un veau sur son lit et pleure comme une Madeleine,que c'est une vraie benediction! Quel chagrin a donc ce pauvre gentiljeune homme?--Allons donc le consoler bien vite, maman; et, si l'on frappe, nousdescendrons.Madame Grandet fut sans defense contre les harmonies de la voix de safille. Eugenie etait sublime, elle etait femme. Toutes deux, le coeurpalpitant, monterent a la chambre de Charles. La porte etait ouverte. Lejeune homme ne voyait ni n'entendait rien. Plonge dans les larmes, ilpoussait des plaintes inarticulees.--Comme il aime son pere? dit Eugenie a voix basse.Il etait impossible de meconnaitre dans l'accent de ces paroles lesesperances d'un coeur a son insu passionne. Aussi madame Grandetjeta-t-elle a sa fille un regard empreint de maternite, puis tout bas al'oreille:--Prends garde, tu l'aimerais, dit-elle.--L'aimer! reprit Eugenie. Ah! si tu savais ce que mon pere a dit!Charles se retourna, apercut sa tante et sa cousine.--J'ai perdu mon pere, mon pauvre pere! S'il m'avait confie le secretde son malheur, nous aurions travaille tous deux a le reparer. Mon Dieu,mon bon pere! je comptais si bien le revoir que je l'ai, je crois,froidement embrasse.Les sanglots lui couperent la parole.--Nous prierons bien pour lui, dit madame Grandet. Resignez-vous a lavolonte de Dieu.--Mon cousin, dit Eugenie, prenez courage! Votre perte est irreparable;ainsi songez maintenant a sauver votre honneur ...Avec cet instinct, cette finesse de la femme qui a de l'esprit en toutechose, meme quand elle console, Eugenie voulait tromper la douleur deson cousin en l'occupant de lui-meme.--Mon honneur?... cria le jeune homme en chassant ses cheveux par unmouvement brusque, et il s'assit sur son lit en se croisant les bras.--Ah! c'est vrai. Mon pere, disait mon oncle, a fait faillite. Ilpoussa un cri dechirant et se cacha le visage dans ses mains.--Laissez-moi, ma cousine, laissez-moi! Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! pardonneza mon pere, il a du bien souffrir.Il y avait quelque chose d'horriblement attachant a voir l'expression decette douleur jeune, vraie, sans calcul, sans arriere-pensee. C'etaitune pudique douleur que les coeurs simples d'Eugenie et de sa merecomprirent quand Charles fit un geste pour leur demander de l'abandonnera lui-meme. Elles descendirent, reprirent en silence leurs places presde la croisee, et travaillerent pendant une heure environ sans se direun mot. Eugenie avait apercu, par le regard furtif qu'elle jeta sur lemenage du jeune homme, ce regard des jeunes filles qui voient tout en unclin d'oeil, les jolies bagatelles de sa toilette, ses ciseaux, sesrasoirs enrichis d'or. Cette echappee d'un luxe vu a travers la douleurlui rendit Charles encore plus interessant, par contraste peut-etre.Jamais un evenement si grave, jamais un spectacle si dramatique n'avaitfrappe l'imagination de ces deux creatures incessamment plongees dans lecalme et la solitude.--Maman, dit Eugenie, nous porterons le deuil de mon oncle.--Ton pere decidera de cela, repondit madame Grandet.Elles resterent de nouveau silencieuses. Eugenie tirait ses points avecune regularite de mouvement qui eut devoile a un observateur lesfecondes pensees de sa meditation. Le premier desir de cette adorablefille etait de partager le deuil de son cousin. Vers quatre heures, uncoup de marteau brusque retentit au coeur de madame Grandet.--Qu'a donc ton pere? dit-elle a sa fille.Le vigneron entra joyeux. Apres avoir ote ses gants, il se frotta lesmains a s'en emporter la peau, si l'epiderme n'en eut pas ete tannecomme du cuir de Russie, sauf l'odeur des melezes et de l'encens. Il sepromenait, il regardait le temps. Enfin son secret lui echappa.--Ma femme, dit-il sans begayer, je les ai tous attrapes. Notre vin estvendu! Les Hollandais et les Belges partaient ce matin, je me suispromene sur la place, devant le auberge, en ayant l'air de betiser.Chose, que tu connais, est venu a moi. Les proprietaires de tous lesbons vignobles gardent leur recolte et veulent attendre, je ne les en aipas empeches. Notre Belge etait desespere. J'ai vu cela. Affaire faite,il prend notre recolte a deux cents francs la piece, moitie comptant. Jesuis paye en or. Les billets sont faits, voila six louis pour toi. Danstrois mois, les vins baisseront.Ces derniers mots furent prononces d'un ton calme, mais si profondementironique, que les gens de Saumur, groupes en ce moment sur la place etaneantis par la nouvelle de la vente que venait de faire Grandet, enauraient fremi s'ils les eussent entendus. Une peur panique eut faittomber les vins de cinquante pour cent.--Vous avez mille pieces cette annee, mon pere? dit Eugenie.--Oui, _fifille_.Ce mot etait l'expression superlative de la joie du vieux tonnelier.--Cela fait deux cent mille pieces de vingt sous.--Oui, mademoiselle Grandet.--Eh! bien, mon pere, vous pouvez facilement secourir Charles.L'etonnement, la colere, la stupefaction de Balthazar en apercevant le_Mane-Tekel-Phares_ ne sauraient se comparer au froid courroux deGrandet qui, ne pensant plus a son neveu, le retrouvait loge au coeur etdans les calculs de sa fille.--Ah! ca, depuis que ce mirliflor a mis le pied dans _ma_ maison, touty va de travers. Vous vous donnez des airs d'acheter des dragees, defaire des noces et des festins. Je ne veux pas de ces choses-la. Jesais, a mon age, comment je dois me conduire, peut-etre! D'ailleurs jen'ai de lecons a prendre ni de ma fille ni de personne. Je ferai pourmon neveu ce qu'il sera convenable de faire, vous n'avez pas a y fourrerle nez. Quant a toi, Eugenie, ajouta-t-il en se tournant vers elle, nem'en parle plus, sinon je t'envoie a l'abbaye de Noyers avec Nanon voirsi j'y suis; et pas plus tard que demain, si tu bronches. Ou est-ildonc, ce garcon, est-il descendu?--Non, mon ami, repondit madame Grandet.--Eh! bien, que fait-il donc?--Il pleure son pere, repondit Eugenie.Grandet regarda sa fille sans trouver un mot a dire. Il etait un peupere, lui. Apres avoir fait un ou deux tours dans la salle, il montapromptement a son cabinet pour y mediter un placement dans les fondspublics. Ses deux mille arpents de foret coupes a blanc lui avaientdonne six cent mille francs; en joignant a cette somme l'argent de sespeupliers, ses revenus de l'annee derniere et de l'annee courante, outreles deux cent mille francs du marche qu'il venait de conclure, ilpouvait faire une masse de neuf cent mille francs. Les vingt pour cent agagner en peu de temps sur les rentes, qui etaient a 80 francs, letentaient. Il chiffra sa speculation sur le journal ou la mort de sonfrere etait annoncee, en entendant, sans les ecouter, les gemissementsde son neveu. Nanon vint cogner au mur pour inviter son maitre adescendre: le diner etait servi. Sous la voute et a la derniere marchede l'escalier, Grandet disait en lui-meme:--Puisque je toucherai mes interets a huit, je ferai cette affaire. Endeux ans, j'aurai quinze cent mille francs que je retirerai de Paris enbon or.--Eh! bien, ou donc est mon neveu?--Il dit qu'il ne veut pas manger, repondit Nanon. Ca n'est pas sain.--Autant d'economise, lui repliqua son maitre.--Dame, _voui_, dit-elle.--Bah! il ne pleurera pas toujours. La faim chasse le loup hors dubois.Le diner fut etrangement silencieux.--Mon bon ami, dit madame Grandet lorsque la nappe fut otee, il faut quenous prenions le deuil.--En verite, madame Grandet, vous ne savez quoi vous inventer pourdepenser de l'argent. Le deuil est dans le coeur et non dans les habits.--Mais le deuil d'un frere est indispensable, et l'Eglise nous ordonnede ...--Achetez votre deuil sur vos six louis. Vous me donnerez un crepe, celame suffira.Eugenie leva les yeux au ciel sans mot dire. Pour la premiere fois danssa vie, ses genereux penchants endormis, comprimes, mais subitementeveilles, etaient a tout moment froisses. Cette soiree fut semblable enapparence a mille soirees de leur existence monotone, mais ce fut certesla plus horrible. Eugenie travailla sans lever la tete, et ne se servitpoint du necessaire que Charles avait dedaigne la veille. Madame Grandettricota ses manches. Grandet tourna ses pouces pendant quatre heures,abime dans des calculs dont les resultats devaient, le lendemain,etonner Saumur. Personne ne vint, ce jour-la, visiter la famille. En cemoment, la ville entiere retentissait du tour de force de Grandet, de lafaillite de son frere et de l'arrivee de son neveu. Pour obeir au besoinde bavarder sur leurs interets communs, tous les proprietaires devignobles des hautes et moyennes societes de Saumur etaient chezmonsieur des Grassins, ou se fulminerent de terribles imprecationscontre l'ancien maire. Nanon filait, et le bruit de son rouet fut laseule voix qui se fit entendre sous les planchers grisatres de la salle.--Nous n'usons point nos langues, dit-elle en montrant ses dentsblanches et grosses comme des amandes pelees.--Ne faut rien user, repondit Grandet en se reveillant de sesmeditations. Il se voyait en perspective huit millions dans trois ans,voguait sur cette longue nappe d'or.--Couchons-nous. J'irai dire bonsoir a mon neveu pour tout le monde, etvoir s'il veut prendre quelque chose.Madame Grandet resta sur le palier du premier etage pour entendre laconversation qui allait avoir lieu entre Charles et le bonhomme.Eugenie, plus hardie que sa mere, monta deux marches.--He! bien, mon neveu, vous avez du chagrin. Oui, pleurez, c'estnaturel. Un pere est un pere. Mais faut prendre notre mal en patience.Je m'occupe de vous pendant que vous pleurez. Je suis un bon parent,voyez-vous. Allons, du courage. Voulez-vous boire un petit verre de vin?Le vin ne coute rien a Saumur, on y offre du vin comme dans les Indesune tasse de the.--Mais, dit Grandet en continuant, vous etes sans lumiere. Mauvais,mauvais! faut voir clair a ce que l'on fait. Grandet marcha vers lacheminee.--Tiens! s'ecria-t-il, voila de la bougie. Ou diable a-t-on peche de labougie? Les garces demoliraient le plancher de ma maison pour cuire desoeufs a ce garcon-la.En entendant ces mots, la mere et la fille rentrerent dans leurschambres et se fourrerent dans leurs lits avec la celerite de souriseffrayees qui rentrent dans leurs trous.--Madame Grandet, vous avez donc un tresor? dit l'homme en entrant dansla chambre de sa femme.--Mon ami, je fais mes prieres, attendez, repondit d'une voix alteree lapauvre mere.--Que le diable emporte ton bon Dieu! repliqua Grandet en grommelant.Les avares ne croient point a une vie a venir, le present est tout poureux. Cette reflexion jette une horrible clarte sur l'epoque actuelle,ou, plus qu'en aucun autre temps, l'argent domine les lois, la politiqueet les moeurs. Institutions, livres, hommes et doctrines, tout conspire aminer la croyance d'une vie future sur laquelle l'edifice social estappuye depuis dix-huit cents ans. Maintenant le cercueil est unetransition peu redoutee. L'avenir, qui nous attendait par dela lerequiem, a ete transpose dans le present. Arriver _per fas et nefas_ auparadis terrestre du luxe et des jouissances vaniteuses, petrifier soncoeur et se macerer le corps en vue de possessions passageres, comme onsouffrait jadis le martyre de la vie en vue de biens eternels, est lapensee generale! pensee d'ailleurs ecrite partout, jusque dans leslois, qui demandent au legislateur: Que payes-tu? au lieu de lui dire:Que penses-tu? Quand cette doctrine aura passe de la bourgeoisie aupeuple, que deviendra le pays?--Madame Grandet, as-tu fini? dit le vieux tonnelier.--Mon ami, je prie pour toi.--Tres bien! bonsoir. Demain matin, nous causerons.La pauvre femme s'endormit comme l'ecolier qui, n'ayant pas appris seslecons, craint de trouver a son reveil le visage irrite du maitre. Aumoment ou, par frayeur, elle se roulait dans ses draps pour ne rienentendre, Eugenie se coula pres d'elle, en chemise, pieds nus, et vintla baiser au front.--Oh! bonne mere, dit-elle, demain, je lui dirai que c'est moi.--Non, il t'enverrait a Noyers. Laisse-moi faire, il ne me mangera pas.--Entends-tu, maman?--Quoi?--He! bien, _il_ pleure toujours.--Va donc te coucher, ma fille. Tu gagneras froid aux pieds. Le carreauest humide.Ainsi se passa la journee solennelle qui devait peser sur toute la viede la riche et pauvre heritiere dont le sommeil ne fut plus aussicomplet ni aussi pur qu'il l'avait ete jusqu'alors. Assez souventcertaines actions de la vie humaine paraissent, litteralement parlant,invraisemblables, quoique vraies. Mais ne serait-ce pas qu'on ometpresque toujours de repandre sur nos determinations spontanees une sortede lumiere psychologique, en n'expliquant pas les raisonsmysterieusement concues qui les ont necessitees? Peut-etre la profondepassion d'Eugenie devrait-elle etre analysee dans ses fibrilles les plusdelicates; car elle devint, diraient quelques railleurs, une maladie,et influenca toute son existence. Beaucoup de gens aiment mieux nier lesdenouements, que de mesurer la force des liens, des noeuds, des attachesqui soudent secretement un fait a un autre dans l'ordre moral. Ici doncle passe d'Eugenie servira, pour les observateurs de la nature humaine,de garantie a la naivete de son irreflexion et a la soudainete deseffusions de son ame. Plus sa vie avait ete tranquille, plus vivement lapitie feminine, le plus ingenieux des sentiments, se deploya dans soname. Aussi, troublee par les evenements de la journee, s'eveilla-t-elle,a plusieurs reprises, pour ecouter son cousin, croyant en avoir entendules soupirs qui depuis la veille lui retentissaient au coeur. Tantot ellele voyait expirant de chagrin, tantot elle le revait mourant de faim.Vers le matin, elle entendit certainement une terrible exclamation.Aussitot elle se vetit, et accourut au petit jour, d'un pied leger,aupres de son cousin qui avait laisse sa porte ouverte. La bougie avaitbrule dans la bobeche du flambeau. Charles, vaincu par la nature,dormait habille, assis dans un fauteuil, la tete renversee sur le lit;il revait comme revent les gens qui ont l'estomac vide. Eugenie putpleurer a son aise; elle put admirer ce jeune et beau visage, marbrepar la douleur, ces yeux gonfles par les larmes, et qui tout endormissemblaient encore verser des pleurs. Charles devina sympathiquement lapresence d'Eugenie, il ouvrit les yeux, et la vit attendrie.--Pardon, ma cousine, dit-il, ne sachant evidemment ni l'heure qu'iletait ni le lieu ou il se trouvait.--Il y a des coeurs qui vous entendent ici, mon cousin, et nous avons cruque vous aviez besoin de quelque chose. Vous devriez vous coucher, vousvous fatiguez en restant ainsi.--Cela est vrai.--He! bien, adieu.Elle se sauva, honteuse et heureuse d'etre venue. L'innocence ose seulede telles hardiesses. Instruite, la Vertu calcule aussi bien que leVice. Eugenie, qui, pres de son cousin, n'avait pas tremble, put a peinese tenir sur ses jambes quand elle fut dans sa chambre. Son ignorantevie avait cesse tout a coup, elle raisonna, se fit mille reproches.Quelle idee va-t-il prendre de moi? Il croira que je l'aime. C'etaitprecisement ce qu'elle desirait le plus de lui voir croire. L'amourfranc a sa prescience et sait que l'amour excite l'amour. Quel evenementpour cette jeune fille solitaire, d'etre ainsi entree furtivement chezun jeune homme! N'y a-t-il pas des pensees, des actions qui, en amour,equivalent, pour certaines ames, a de saintes fiancailles! Une heureapres, elle entra chez sa mere, et l'habilla suivant son habitude. Puiselles vinrent s'asseoir a leurs places devant la fenetre et attendirentGrandet avec cette anxiete qui glace le coeur ou l'echauffe, le serre oule dilate suivant les caracteres, alors que l'on redoute une scene, unepunition; sentiment d'ailleurs si naturel, que les animaux domestiquesl'eprouvent au point de crier pour le faible mal d'une correction, euxqui se taisent quand ils se blessent par inadvertance. Le bonhommedescendit, mais il parla d'un air distrait a sa femme, embrassa Eugenie,et se mit a table sans paraitre penser a ses menaces de la veille.--Que devient mon neveu? l'enfant n'est pas genant.--Monsieur, il dort, repondit Nanon.--Tant mieux, il n'a pas besoin de bougie, dit Grandet d'un tongoguenard.Cette clemence insolite, cette amere gaiete frapperent madame Grandetqui regarda son mari fort attentivement. Le bonhomme ... Ici peut-etreest-il convenable de faire observer qu'en Touraine, en Anjou, en Poitou,dans la Bretagne, le mot bonhomme, deja souvent employe pour designerGrandet, est decerne aux hommes les plus cruels comme aux plus bonasses,aussitot qu'ils sont arrives a un certain age. Ce titre ne prejuge riensur la mansuetude individuelle. Le bonhomme, donc, prit son chapeau, sesgants, et dit:--Je vais muser sur la place pour rencontrer nos Cruchot.--Eugenie, ton pere a decidement quelque chose.En effet, peu dormeur, Grandet employait la moitie de ses nuits auxcalculs preliminaires qui donnaient a ses vues, a ses observations, ases plans, leur etonnante justesse et leur assuraient cette constantereussite de laquelle s'emerveillaient les Saumurois. Tout pouvoir humainest un compose de patience et de temps. Les gens puissants veulent etveillent. La vie de l'avare est un constant exercice de la puissancehumaine mise au service de la personnalite. Il ne s'appuie que sur deuxsentiments: l'amour-propre et l'interet; mais l'interet etant enquelque sorte l'amour-propre solide et bien entendu, l'attestationcontinue d'une superiorite reelle, l'amour-propre et l'interet sont deuxparties d'un meme tout, l'egoisme. De la vient peut-etre la prodigieusecuriosite qu'excitent les avares habilement mis en scene. Chacun tientpar un fil a ces personnages qui s'attaquent a tous les sentimentshumains, en les resumant tous. Ou est l'homme sans desir, et quel desirsocial se resoudra sans argent? Grandet avait bien reellement quelquechose, suivant l'expression de sa femme. Il se rencontrait en lui, commechez tous les avares, un persistant besoin de jouer une partie avec lesautres hommes, de leur gagner legalement leurs ecus. Imposer autrui,n'est-ce pas faire acte de pouvoir, se donner perpetuellement le droitde mepriser ceux qui, trop faibles, se laissent ici-bas devorer? Oh!qui a bien compris l'agneau paisiblement couche aux pieds de Dieu, leplus touchant embleme de toutes les victimes terrestres, celui de leuravenir, enfin la Souffrance et la Faiblesse glorifiees? Cet agneau,l'avare le laisse s'engraisser, il le parque, le tue, le cuit, le mangeet le meprise. La pature des avares se compose d'argent et de dedain.Pendant la nuit, les idees du bonhomme avaient pris un autre cours: dela, sa clemence. Il avait ourdi une trame pour se moquer des Parisiens,pour les tordre, les rouler, les petrir, les faire aller, venir, suer,esperer, palir; pour s'amuser d'eux, lui, ancien tonnelier au fond desa salle grise, en montant l'escalier vermoulu de sa maison de Saumur.Son neveu l'avait occupe. Il voulait sauver l'honneur de son frere mortsans qu'il en coutat un sou ni a son neveu ni a lui. Ses fonds allaientetre places pour trois ans, il n'avait plus qu'a gerer ses biens, ilfallait donc un aliment a son activite malicieuse et il l'avait trouvedans la faillite de son frere. Ne se sentant rien entre les pattes apressurer, il voulait concasser les Parisiens au profit de Charles, etse montrer excellent frere a bon marche. L'honneur de la famille entraitpour si peu de chose dans son projet, que sa bonne volonte doit etrecomparee au besoin qu'eprouvent les joueurs de voir bien jouer unepartie dans laquelle ils n'ont pas d'enjeu. Et les Cruchot lui etaientnecessaires, et il ne voulait pas les aller chercher, et il avait decidede les faire arriver chez lui, et d'y commencer ce soir meme la comediedont le plan venait d'etre concu, afin d'etre le lendemain, sans qu'illui en coutat un denier, l'objet de l'admiration de sa ville. *Promessesd'avare, serments d'amour* En l'absence de son pere, Eugenie eut lebonheur de pouvoir s'occuper ouvertement de son bien-aime cousin,d'epancher sur lui sans crainte les tresors de sa pitie, l'une dessublimes superiorites de la femme, la seule qu'elle veuille fairesentir, la seule qu'elle pardonne a l'homme de lui laisser prendre surlui. Trois ou quatre fois, Eugenie alla ecouter la respiration de soncousin; savoir s'il dormait, s'il se reveillait; puis, quand il seleva, la creme, le cafe, les oeufs, les fruits, les assiettes, le verre,tout ce qui faisait partie du dejeuner, fut pour elle l'objet de quelquesoin. Elle grimpa lestement dans le vieil escalier pour ecouter le bruitque faisait son cousin. S'habillait-il? pleurait-il encore? Elle vintjusqu'a la porte.--Mon cousin?--Ma cousine.--Voulez-vous dejeuner dans la salle ou dans votre chambre?--Ou vous voudrez.--Comment vous trouvez-vous?--Ma chere cousine, j'ai honte d'avoir faim.Cette conversation a travers la porte etait pour Eugenie tout un episodede roman.--Eh! bien, nous vous apporterons a dejeuner dans votre chambre, afinde ne pas contrarier mon pere. Elle descendit dans la cuisine avec lalegerete d'un oiseau.--Nanon, va donc faire sa chambre.Cet escalier si souvent monte, descendu, ou retentissait le moindrebruit, semblait a Eugenie avoir perdu son caractere de vetuste; elle levoyait lumineux, il parlait, il etait jeune comme elle, jeune comme sonamour auquel il servait. Enfin sa mere, sa bonne et indulgente mere,voulut bien se preter aux fantaisies de son amour, et lorsque la chambrede Charles fut faite, elles allerent toutes deux tenir compagnie aumalheureux: la charite chretienne n'ordonnait-elle pas de le consoler?Ces deux femmes puiserent dans la religion bon nombre de petitssophismes pour se justifier leurs deportements. Charles Grandet se vitdonc l'objet des soins les plus affectueux et les plus tendres. Son coeurendolori sentit vivement la douceur de cette amitie veloutee, de cetteexquise sympathie, que ces deux ames toujours contraintes surentdeployer en se trouvant libres un moment dans la region des souffrances,leur sphere naturelle. Autorisee par la parente, Eugenie se mit a rangerle linge, les objets de toilette que son cousin avait apportes, et puts'emerveiller a son aise de chaque luxueuse babiole, des colifichetsd'argent, d'or travaille qui lui tombaient sous la main, et qu'elletenait longtemps sous pretexte de les examiner. Charles ne vit pas sansun attendrissement profond l'interet genereux que lui portaient sa tanteet sa cousine; il connaissait assez la societe de Paris pour savoir quedans sa position il n'y eut trouve que des coeurs indifferents ou froids.Eugenie lui apparut dans toute la splendeur de sa beaute speciale.Il admira des lors l'innocence de ces moeurs dont il se moquait laveille. Aussi, quand Eugenie prit des mains de Nanon le bol de faienceplein de cafe a la creme pour le lui servir avec toute l'ingenuite dusentiment, et en lui jetant un bon regard, ses yeux se mouillerent-ilsde larmes, il lui prit la main et la baisa.--He! bien, qu'avez-vous encore? demanda-t-elle.--C'est des larmes de reconnaissance, repondit-il. Eugenie se tournabrusquement vers la cheminee pour prendre les flambeaux.--Nanon, tenez, emportez, dit-elle.Quand elle regarda son cousin, elle etait bien rouge encore, mais aumoins ses regards purent mentir et ne pas peindre la joie excessive quilui inondait le coeur; mais leurs yeux exprimerent un meme sentiment,comme leurs ames se fondirent dans une meme pensee: l'avenir etait aeux. Cette douce emotion fut d'autant plus delicieuse pour Charles aumilieu de son immense chagrin, qu'elle etait moins attendue. Un coup demarteau rappela les deux femmes a leurs places. Par bonheur, ellespurent redescendre assez rapidement l'escalier pour se trouver al'ouvrage quand Grandet entra; s'il les eut rencontrees sous la voute,il n'en aurait pas fallu davantage pour exciter ses soupcons. Apres ledejeuner, que le bonhomme fit sur le pouce, le garde, auquel l'indemnitepromise n'avait pas encore ete donnee, arriva de Froidfond, d'ou ilapportait un lievre, des perdreaux tues dans le parc, des anguilles etdeux brochets dus par les meuniers.--Eh! eh! ce pauvre Cornoiller, il vient comme maree en careme. Est-cebon a manger, ca?--Oui, mon cher genereux monsieur, c'est tue depuis deux jours.--Allons, Nanon, haut le pied, dit le bonhomme. Prends-moi cela, ce serapour le diner, je regale deux Cruchot.Nanon ouvrit des yeux betes et regarda tout le monde.--Eh! bien, dit-elle, ou que je trouverai du lard et des epices?--Ma femme, dit Grandet, donne six francs a Nanon, et fais-moi souvenird'aller a la cave chercher du bon vin.--Eh! bien, donc, monsieur Grandet, reprit le garde qui avait preparesa harangue afin de faire decider la question de ses appointements,monsieur Grandet ...--Ta, ta, ta, ta, dit Grandet, je sais ce que tu veux dire, tu es un bondiable, nous verrons cela demain, je suis trop presse aujourd'hui.--Ma femme, donne-lui cent sous, dit-il a madame Grandet.Il decampa. La pauvre femme fut trop heureuse d'acheter la paix pouronze francs. Elle savait que Grandet se taisait pendant quinze jours,apres avoir ainsi repris, piece a piece, l'argent qu'il lui donnait.--Tiens, Cornoiller, dit-elle en lui glissant dix francs dans la main,quelque jour nous reconnaitrons tes services.Cornoiller n'eut rien a dire. Il partit.--Madame, dit Nanon, qui avait mis sa coiffe noire et pris son panier,je n'ai besoin que de trois francs, gardez le reste. Allez, ca ira toutde meme.--Fais un bon diner, Nanon, mon cousin descendra, dit Eugenie.--Decidement, il se passe ici quelque chose d'extraordinaire, dit madameGrandet. Voici la troisieme fois que, depuis notre mariage, ton peredonne a diner.Vers quatre heures, au moment ou Eugenie et sa mere avaient fini demettre un couvert pour six personnes, et ou le maitre du logis avaitmonte quelques bouteilles de ces vins exquis que conservent lesprovinciaux avec amour, Charles vint dans la salle. Le jeune homme etaitpale. Ses gestes, sa contenance, ses regards et le son de sa voix eurentune tristesse pleine de grace. Il ne jouait pas la douleur, il souffraitveritablement, et le voile etendu sur ses traits par la peine luidonnait cet air interessant qui plait tant aux femmes. Eugenie l'en aimabien davantage. Peut-etre aussi le malheur l'avait-il rapproche d'elle.Charles n'etait plus ce riche et beau jeune homme place dans une sphereinabordable pour elle; mais un parent plonge dans une effroyablemisere. La misere enfante l'egalite. La femme a cela de commun avecl'ange que les etres souffrants lui appartiennent. Charles et Eugenies'entendirent et se parlerent des yeux seulement; car le pauvre dandydechu, l'orphelin se mit dans un coin, s'y tint muet, calme et fier;mais, de moment en moment, le regard doux et caressant de sa cousinevenait luire sur lui, le contraignait a quitter ses tristes pensees, as'elancer avec elle dans les champs de l'Esperance et de l'Avenir ouelle aimait a s'engager avec lui. En ce moment, la ville de Saumur etaitplus emue du diner offert par Grandet aux Cruchot qu'elle ne l'avait etela veille par la vente de sa recolte qui constituait un crime de hautetrahison envers le vignoble. Si le politique vigneron eut donne sondiner dans la meme pensee qui couta la queue au chien d'Alcibiade, ilaurait ete peut-etre un grand homme; mais trop superieur a une ville delaquelle il se jouait sans cesse, il ne faisait aucun cas de Saumur. Lesdes Grassins apprirent bientot la mort violente et la faillite probabledu pere de Charles, ils resolurent d'aller des le soir meme chez leurclient afin de prendre part a son malheur et lui donner des signesd'amitie, tout en s'informant des motifs qui pouvaient l'avoir determinea inviter, en semblable occurrence, les Cruchot a diner. A cinq heuresprecises, le president G. de Bonfons et son oncle le notaire arriverentendimanches jusqu'aux dents. Les convives se mirent a table etcommencerent par manger notablement bien. Grandet etait grave, Charlessilencieux, Eugenie muette, madame Grandet ne parla pas plus que decoutume, en sorte que ce diner fut un veritable repas de condoleance.Quand on se leva de table, Charles dit a sa tante et a son oncle:--Permettez-moi de me retirer. Je suis oblige de m'occuper d'une longueet triste correspondance.--Faites, mon neveu.Lorsque apres son depart le bonhomme put presumer que Charles ne pouvaitrien entendre, et devait etre plonge dans ses ecritures, il regardasournoisement sa femme.--Madame Grandet, ce que nous avons a dire serait du latin pour vous, ilest sept heures et demie, vous devriez allez vous serrer dans votreportefeuille. Bonne nuit, ma fille.Il embrassa Eugenie, et les deux femmes sortirent. La commenca la sceneou le pere Grandet, plus qu'en aucun autre moment de sa vie, employal'adresse qu'il avait acquise dans le commerce des hommes, et qui luivalait souvent, de la part de ceux dont il mordait un peu trop rudementla peau, le surnom de _vieux chien_. Si le maire de Saumur eut porte sonambition plus haut, si d'heureuses circonstances, en le faisant arriververs les spheres superieures de la Societe, l'eussent envoye dans lescongres ou se traitaient les affaires des nations, et qu'il s'y futservi du genie dont l'avait dote son interet personnel, nul doute qu'iln'y eut ete glorieusement utile a la France. Neanmoins, peut-etre aussiserait-il egalement probable que, sorti de Saumur, le bonhomme n'auraitfait qu'une pauvre figure. Peut-etre en est-il des esprits comme decertains animaux, qui n'engendrent plus transplantes hors des climats ouils naissent.--Mon ... on ... on ... on ... sieur le pre ... pre ... pre ... president,vouoouous di ... di ... di ... disiiieeez que la faaaaiiillite ...Le bredouillement affecte depuis si longtemps par le bonhomme et quipassait pour naturel, aussi bien que la surdite dont il se plaignait parles temps de pluie, devint, en cette conjoncture, si fatigant pour lesdeux Cruchot, qu'en ecoutant le vigneron ils grimacaient a leur insu, enfaisant des efforts comme s'ils voulaient achever les mots dans lesquelsil s'empetrait a plaisir. Ici, peut-etre, devient-il necessaire dedonner l'histoire du begayement et de la surdite de Grandet. Personne,dans l'Anjou, n'entendait mieux et ne pouvait prononcer plus nettementle francais angevin que le ruse vigneron. Jadis, malgre toute safinesse, il avait ete dupe par un Israelite qui, dans la discussion,appliquait sa main a son oreille en guise de cornet, sous pretexte demieux entendre, et baragouinait si bien en cherchant ses mots, queGrandet, victime de son humanite, se crut oblige de suggerer a ce malinJuif les mots et les idees que paraissait chercher le Juif, d'acheverlui-meme les raisonnements dudit Juif, de parler comme devait parler ledamne Juif, d'etre enfin le Juif et non Grandet. Le tonnelier sortit dece combat bizarre, ayant conclu le seul marche dont il ait eu a seplaindre pendant le cours de sa vie commerciale. Mais s'il y perditpecuniairement parlant, il y gagna moralement une bonne lecon, et, plustard, il en recueillit les fruits. Aussi le bonhomme finit-il par benirle Juif qui lui avait appris l'art d'impatienter son adversairecommercial; et, en l'occupant a exprimer sa pensee, de lui faireconstamment perdre de vue la sienne. Or, aucune affaire n'exigea, plusque celle dont il s'agissait, l'emploi de la surdite, du bredouillement,et des ambages incomprehensibles dans lesquels Grandet enveloppait sesidees. D'abord, il ne voulait pas endosser la responsabilite de sesidees; puis, il voulait rester maitre de sa parole, et laisser en douteses veritables intentions.--Monsieur de Bon ... Bon ... Bonfons ... Pour la seconde fois, depuistrois ans, Grandet nommait Cruchot neveu monsieur de Bonfons. Le presidentput se croire choisi pour gendre par l'artificieux bonhomme.--Vooouuous di ... di ... di ... disiez donc que les faiiiillites peu ...peu ... peu ... peuvent, dandans ce ... ertains cas, etre empe ... pe ...pe ... chees pa ... par ...--Par les tribunaux de commerce eux-memes. Cela se voit tous les jours,dit monsieur C. de Bonfons enfourchant l'idee du pere Grandet ou croyantla deviner et voulant affectueusement la lui expliquer. Ecoutez?--J'ecoucoute, repondit humblement le bonhomme en prenant la malicieusecontenance d'un enfant qui rit interieurement de son professeur tout enparaissant lui preter la plus grande attention.--Quand un homme considerable et considere, comme l'etait, par exemple,defunt monsieur votre frere a Paris ...--Mon ... on frere, oui.--Est menace d'une deconfiture ...--Caaaa s'aappelle de, de, deconfiture?--Oui. Que sa faillite devient imminente, le tribunal de commerce, dontil est justiciable (suivez bien), a la faculte, par un jugement, denommer, a sa maison de commerce, des liquidateurs. Liquider n'est pasfaire faillite, comprenez-vous? En faisant faillite, un homme estdeshonore; mais en liquidant, il reste honnete homme.--C'est bien di, di, di, different, si caaa ne cou, ou, ou, ou, outepas, pas, pas plus cher, dit Grandet.--Mais une liquidation peut encore se faire, meme sans le secours dutribunal de commerce. Car, dit le president en humant sa prise de tabac,comment se declare une faillite?--Oui, je n'y ai jamais pen, pen, pen, pense, repondit Grandet.--Premierement, reprit le magistrat, par le depot du bilan au greffe dutribunal, que fait le negociant lui-meme, ou son fonde de pouvoirs,dument enregistre. Deuxiemement, a la requete des creanciers. Or, si lenegociant ne depose pas de bilan, si aucun creancier ne requiert dutribunal un jugement qui declare le susdit negociant en faillite,qu'arriverait-il?--Oui, i, i, voy, voy ... ons.--Alors la famille du decede, ses representants, son hoirie; ou lenegociant, s'il n'est pas mort; ou ses amis, s'il est cache, liquident.Peut-etre voulez-vous liquider les affaires de votre frere? demanda lepresident.--Ah! Grandet, s'ecria le notaire, ce serait bien. Il y a de l'honneurau fond de nos provinces. Si vous sauviez votre nom, car c'est votrenom, vous seriez un homme ...--Sublime, dit le president en interrompant son oncle.--Ceertainement, repliqua le vieux vigneron mon, mon fffr, fre, frere seno, no, ne noommait Grandet tou ...

Comprenez-vous?Grandet se fit un cornet de sa main, l'appliqua sur son oreille, et lepresident lui repeta sa phrase.--Mais, repondit le vigneron, il y a ddddonc a boire et a manger dan,dans tout cela. Je, je, je ne sais rien, a mon aaage, de toooutes ce,ce, ces choooses-la. Je doi, dois re, ester i, i, ici pour ve, ve,veiller au grain.

Eh! bien, mon vieil, ami,vous avez des amis, de vieux amis, capables de devouement pour vous.--Allons donc, pensait en lui-meme le vigneron, decidez-vous donc!--Et si quelqu'un partait pour Paris, y cherchait le plus fort creancierde votre frere Guillaume, lui disait ...--Mi, min, minute, ici, reprit le bonhomme, lui disait.

Hein! pas vrai?--Certainement, dit le president. Je suis d'avis, moi, qu'en quelquesmois de temps l'on pourra racheter les creances pour une somme de, etpayer integralement par arrangement. Ha! ha! l'on mene les chiens bienloin en leur montrant un morceau de lard. Quand il n'y a pas eu dedeclaration de faillite et que vous tenez les titres de creances, vousdevenez blanc comme neige.--Comme ne, ne, neige, repeta Grandet en refaisant un cornet de sa main.Je ne comprends pas la ne, ne, neige.--Mais, cria le president, ecoutez-moi donc, alors.--J'e, j'e, j'ecoute.--Un effet est une marchandise qui peut avoir sa hausse et sa baisse.Ceci est une deduction du principe de Jeremie Bentham sur l'usure. Cepubliciste a prouve que le prejuge qui frappait de reprobation lesusuriers etait une sottise.--Ouais! fit le bonhomme.--Attendu qu'en principe, selon Bentham, l'argent est une marchandise,et que ce qui represente l'argent devient egalement marchandise, repritle president; attendu qu'il est notoire que, soumise aux variationshabituelles qui regissent les choses commerciales, la marchandise-billet, portant telle ou telle signature, comme tel ou tel article,abonde ou manque sur la place, qu'elle est chere ou tombe a rien, letribunal ordonne ... (tiens! que je suis bete, pardon), je suis d'avisque vous pourrez racheter votre frere pour vingt-cinq du cent.--Vooous le no, no, no, nommez Je, Je, Je, Jeremie Ben ...--Bentham, un Anglais.--Ce Jeremie-la nous fera eviter bien des lamentations dans lesaffaires, dit le notaire en riant.--Ces Anglais ont que, que, quelquefois du bon, bon sens, dit Grandet.Ainsi, se, se, se, selon Ben, Ben, Ben, Bentham, si les effets de monfrere ... va, va, va, va, valent ... ne valent pas. Si. Je, je, je, disbien, n'est-ce pas? Cela me parait clair ... Les creanciers seraient... Non, ne seraient pas. Je m'een, entends.--Laissez-moi vous expliquer tout ceci, dit le president. En Droit, sivous possedez les titres de toutes les creances dues par la maisonGrandet, votre frere ou ses hoirs ne doivent rien a personne. Bien.--Bien, repeta le bonhomme.--En equite, si les effets de votre frere se negocient (negocient,entendez-vous bien ce terme?) sur la place a tant pour cent de perte;si l'un de vos amis a passe par la; s'il les a rachetes, les creanciersn'ayant ete contraints par aucune violence a les donner, la successionde feu Grandet de Paris se trouve loyalement quitte.--C'est vrai, les a, a, a, affaires sont les affaires, dit le tonnelier.Cela pooooose ... Mais, neanmoins, vous compre, ne, ne, ne, nez, quec'est di, di, di, difficile ... Je, je, je n'ai pas d'aaargent, ni, ni,ni le temps, ni le temps, ni ...--Oui, vous ne pouvez pas vous deranger. He! bien, je vous offred'aller a Paris (vous me tiendriez compte du voyage, c'est une misere).J'y vois les creanciers, je leur parle, j'atermoie, et tout s'arrangeavec un supplement de payement que vous ajoutez aux valeurs de laliquidation, afin de rentrer dans les titres de creances.--Mais nooonous verrons cela, je ne, ne, ne peux pas, je, je, je ne veuxpas m'en, en, en, engager sans, sans, que ... Qui, qui, qui, ne, ne peut,ne peut. Vooouous comprenez?--Cela est juste.--J'ai la tete ca, ca, cassee de ce que, que voous, vous m'a, a, a, avezde, de, declique la. Voila la, la, premiere fois de ma vie que je, jesuis fooorce de son, songer a de ...--Oui, vous n'etes pas jurisconsulte.--Je, je suis un pau, pau, pauvre vigneron, et ne sais rien de ce quevou, vou, vous venez de dire; il fau, fau, faut que j'e, j'e, j'etudieccca.--He! bien, reprit le president en se posant comme pour resumer ladiscussion.--Mon neveu?... fit le notaire d'un ton de reproche en l'interrompant.--He! bien, mon oncle, repondit le president.--Laisse donc monsieur Grandet t'expliquer ses intentions. Il s'agit ence moment d'un mandat important. Notre cher ami doit le definir congrum ...Un coup de marteau qui annonca l'arrivee de la famille des Grassins,leur entree et leurs salutations empecherent Cruchot d'achever saphrase. Le notaire fut content de cette interruption; deja Grandet leregardait de travers, et sa loupe indiquait un orage interieur; maisd'abord le prudent notaire ne trouvait pas convenable a un president detribunal de premiere instance d'aller a Paris pour y faire capituler descreanciers et y preter les mains a un tripotage qui froissait les loisde la stricte probite; puis, n'ayant pas encore entendu le pere Grandetexprimant la moindre velleite de payer quoi que ce fut, il tremblaitinstinctivement de voir son neveu engage dans cette affaire. Il profitadonc du moment ou les des Grassins entraient pour prendre le presidentpar le bras et l'attirer dans l'embrasure de la fenetre.--Tu t'es bien suffisamment montre mon neveu; mais assez de devouementcomme ca. L'envie d'avoir la fille t'aveugle. Diable! il n'y faut pasaller comme une corneille qui abat des noix. Laisse-moi maintenantconduire la barque, aide seulement a la manoeuvre. Est-ce bien ton rolede compromettre ta dignite de magistrat dans une pareille ...Il n'acheva pas; il entendait monsieur des Grassins disant au vieuxtonnelier en lui tendant la main:--Grandet nous avons appris l'affreux malheur arrive dans votre famille,le desastre de la maison Guillaume Grandet et la mort de votre frere;nous venons vous exprimer toute la part que nous prenons a ce tristeevenement.--Il n'y a d'autre malheur, dit le notaire en interrompant le banquier,que la mort de monsieur Grandet junior. Encore ne se serait-il pas tues'il avait eu l'idee d'appeler son frere a son secours. Notre vieil amiqui a de l'honneur jusqu'au bout des ongles compte liquider les dettesde la maison Grandet de Paris. Mon neveu le president pour lui eviterles tracas d'une affaire tout judiciaire lui offre de partirsur-le-champ pour Paris afin de transiger avec les creanciers et lessatisfaire convenablement.Ces paroles confirmees par l'attitude du vigneron qui se caressait lementon surprirent etrangement les trois des Grassins qui pendant lechemin avaient medit tout a loisir de l'avarice de Grandet en l'accusantpresque d'un fratricide.--Ah! je le savais bien s'ecria le banquier en regardant sa femme. Quete disais-je en route, madame des Grassins? Grandet a de l'honneurjusqu'au bout des cheveux, et ne souffrira pas que son nom recoive laplus legere atteinte! L'argent sans l'honneur est une maladie. Il y ade l'honneur dans nos provinces! Cela est bien, tres bien Grandet. Jesuis un vieux militaire, je ne sais pas deguiser ma pensee; je la disrudement: cela est, mille tonnerres! sublime.--Aaalors llle su ... su ... sub ... sublime est bi ... bi ... bien cher,repondit le bonhomme pendant que le banquier lui secouait chaleureusementla main.--Mais ceci, mon brave Grandet, n'en deplaise a monsieur le president,reprit des Grassins, est une affaire purement commerciale, et veut unnegociant consomme. Ne faut-il pas se connaitre aux comptes de retour,debours, calculs d'interets? Je dois aller a Paris pour mes affaires,et je pourrais alors me charger de ...--Nous verrions donc a ta ... ta ... tacher de nous aaaarranger tou ...tous deux dans les po ... po ... po ... possibilites relatives et sansm'en ... m'en ... m'engager a quelque chose que je ... je ... je nevoooou ... oudrais pas faire, dit Grandet en begayant. Parce que,voyez-vous, monsieur le president me demandait naturellement les fraisdu voyage.Le bonhomme ne bredouilla plus ces derniers mots.--Eh! dit madame des Grassins, mais c'est un plaisir que d'etre aParis. Je payerais volontiers pour y aller, moi.Et elle fit un signe a son mari comme pour l'encourager a souffler cettecommission a leurs adversaires coute que coute; puis elle regarda fortironiquement les deux Cruchot, qui prirent une mine piteuse. Grandetsaisit alors le banquier par un des boutons de son habit et l'attiradans un coin.--J'aurais bien plus de confiance en vous que dans le president, luidit-il. Puis il y a des anguilles sous roche, ajouta-t-il en remuant saloupe. Je veux me mettre dans la rente; j'ai quelques milliers defrancs de rente a faire acheter, et je ne veux placer qu'a quatre-vingtsfrancs. Cette mecanique baisse, dit-on, a la fin des mois. Vous vousconnaissez a ca, pas vrai?--Pardieu! Eh! bien, j'aurais donc quelques mille livres de rente alever pour vous?--Pas grand'chose pour commencer. _Motus_! Je veux jouer ce jeu-la sansqu'on n'en sache rien. Vous me concluriez un marche pour la fin du mois;mais n'en dites rien aux Cruchot, ca les taquinerait. Puisque vousallez a Paris, nous y verrons en meme temps, pour mon pauvre neveu, dequelle couleur sont les atouts.--Voila qui est entendu. Je partirai demain en poste, dit a haute voixdes Grassins, et je viendrai prendre vos dernieres instructions a ... aquelle heure?--A cinq heures, avant le diner, dit le vigneron en se frottant lesmains.Les deux partis resterent encore quelques instants en presence.Des Grassins dit apres une pause en frappant sur l'epaule de Grandet:--Il fait bon avoir de bons parents comme ca ...--Oui, oui, sans que ca paraisse, repondit Grandet, je suis un bon pa ...parent. J'aimais mon frere, et je le prouverai bien si si ca ne ne coutepas ...--Nous allons vous quitter, Grandet, lui dit le banquier enl'interrompant heureusement avant qu'il n'achevat sa phrase. Si j'avancemon depart, il faut mettre en ordre quelques affaires.--Bien, bien. Moi-meme, raa ... apport a ce que vouvous savez je je vaisme rereretirer dans ma cham ... ambre des dedeliberations, comme dit lepresident Cruchot.--Peste! je ne suis plus monsieur de Bonfons, pensa tristement lemagistrat dont la figure prit l'expression de celle d'un juge ennuye parune plaidoirie.Les chefs des deux familles rivales s'en allerent ensemble. Ni les unsni les autres ne songeaient plus a la trahison dont s'etait renducoupable Grandet le matin envers le pays vignoble, et se sonderentmutuellement, mais en vain, pour connaitre ce qu'ils pensaient sur lesintentions reelles du bonhomme en cette nouvelle affaire.--Venez-vous chez madame Dorsonval avec nous? dit des Grassins aunotaire.--Nous irons plus tard, repondit le president. Si mon oncle le permet,j'ai promis a mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt de lui dire un petit bonsoir,et nous nous y rendrons d'abord.--Au revoir donc, messieurs, dit madame des Grassins. Et, quand les desGrassins furent a quelques pas des deux Cruchot, Adolphe dit a son pere:--Ils fument joliment, hein?--Tais-toi donc, mon fils, lui repliqua sa mere, ils peuvent encore nousentendre. D'ailleurs ce que tu dis n'est pas de bon gout et sent l'Ecolede Droit.--Eh! bien, mon oncle, s'ecria le magistrat quand il vit les desGrassins eloignes, j'ai commence par etre le president de Bonfons, etj'ai fini par etre tout simplement un Cruchot.--J'ai bien vu que ca te contrariait; mais le vent etait aux desGrassins. Es-tu bete, avec tout ton esprit?... Laisse-les s'embarquersur un _nous verrons_ du pere Grandet, et tiens-toi tranquille, monpetit: Eugenie n'en sera pas moins ta femme.En quelques instants la nouvelle de la magnanime resolution de Grandetse repandit dans trois maisons a la fois, et il ne fut plus questiondans toute la ville que de ce devouement fraternel. Chacun pardonnait aGrandet sa vente faite au mepris de la foi juree entre lesproprietaires, en admirant son honneur, en vantant une generosite donton ne le croyait pas capable. Il est dans le caractere francais des'enthousiasmer, de se colerer, de se passionner pour le meteore dumoment, pour les batons flottants de l'actualite. Les etres collectifs,les peuples, seraient-ils donc sans memoire?Quand le pere Grandet eut ferme sa porte, il appela Nanon.--Ne lache pas le chien et ne dors pas, nous avons a travaillerensemble. A onze heures Cornoiller doit se trouver a ma porte avec leberlingot de Froidfond. Ecoute-le venir afin de l'empecher de cogner, etdis-lui d'entrer tout bellement. Les lois de police defendent le tapagenocturne. D'ailleurs le quartier n'a pas besoin de savoir que je vais memettre en route.Ayant dit, Grandet remonta dans son laboratoire, ou Nanon l'entenditremuant, fouillant, allant, venant, mais avec precaution. Il ne voulaitevidemment reveiller ni sa femme ni sa fille, et surtout ne pointexciter l'attention de son neveu, qu'il avait commence par maudire enapercevant de la lumiere dans sa chambre. Au milieu de la nuit, Eugenie,preoccupee de son cousin, crut avoir entendu la plainte d'un mourant, etpour elle ce mourant etait Charles: elle l'avait quitte si pale, sidesespere! peut-etre s'etait-il tue. Soudain elle s'enveloppa d'unecoiffe, espece de pelisse a capuchon, et voulut sortir. D'abord une vivelumiere qui passait par les fentes de sa porte lui donna peur du feu;puis elle se rassura bientot en entendant les pas pesants de Nanon et savoix melee au hennissement de plusieurs chevaux.--Mon pere enleverait-il mon cousin? se dit-elle en entr'ouvrant saporte avec assez de precaution pour l'empecher de crier, mais de manierea voir ce qui se passait dans le corridor.Tout a coup son oeil rencontra celui de son pere, dont le regard, quelquevague et insouciant qu'il fut, la glaca de terreur. Le bonhomme et Nanonetaient accouples par un gros gourdin dont chaque bout reposait sur leurepaule droite et soutenait un cable auquel etait attache un barilletsemblable a ceux que le pere Grandet s'amusait a faire dans son fournila ses moments perdus.--Sainte Vierge! monsieur, ca pese-t-il?... dit a voix basse la Nanon.--Quel malheur que ce ne soit que des gros sous! repondit le bonhomme.Prends garde de heurter le chandelier.Cette scene etait eclairee par une seule chandelle placee entre deuxbarreaux de la rampe.--Cornoiller, dit Grandet a son garde _in partibus_, as-tu pris tespistolets?--Non, monsieur. Parde! quoi qu'il y a donc a craindre pour vos grossous?...--Oh! rien, dit le pere Grandet.--D'ailleurs nous irons vite, reprit le garde, vos fermiers ont choisipour vous leurs meilleurs chevaux.--Bien, bien. Tu ne leur as pas dit ou j'allais?--Je ne le savais point.--Bien. La voiture est solide?--Ca, notre maitre? ha! ben, ca porterait trois mille. Qu'est-ce queca pese donc vos mechants barils?--Tiens, dit Nanon, je le savons bien! Y a ben pres de dix-huit cents.--Veux-tu te taire, Nanon! Tu diras a ma femme que je suis alle a lacampagne. Je serai revenu pour diner. Va bon train, Cornoiller, fautetre a Angers avant neuf heures.La voiture partit. Nanon verrouilla la grande porte, lacha le chien, secoucha l'epaule meurtrie, et personne dans le quartier ne soupconna nile depart de Grandet ni l'objet de son voyage. La discretion du bonhommeetait complete. Personne ne voyait jamais un sou dans cette maisonpleine d'or. Apres avoir appris dans la matinee par les causeries duport que l'or avait double de prix par suite de nombreux armementsentrepris a Nantes, et que des speculateurs etaient arrives a Angerspour en acheter, le vieux vigneron par un simple emprunt de chevaux faita ses fermiers, se mit en mesure d'aller y vendre le sien et d'enrapporter en valeurs du receveur-general sur le tresor la sommenecessaire a l'achat de ses rentes apres l'avoir grossie de l'agio.--Mon pere s'en va, dit Eugenie qui du haut de l'escalier avait toutentendu. Le silence etait retabli dans la maison, et le lointainroulement de la voiture, qui cessa par degres, ne retentissait deja plusdans Saumur endormi. En ce moment, Eugenie entendit en son coeur, avantde l'ecouter par l'oreille, une plainte qui perca les cloisons, et quivenait de la chambre de son cousin. Une bande lumineuse, fine autant quele tranchant d'un sabre, passait par la fente de la porte et coupaithorizontalement les balustres du vieil escalier.--Il souffre, dit-elle en grimpant deux marches. Un second gemissementla fit arriver sur le palier de la chambre. La porte etait entr'ouverte,elle la poussa. Charles dormait la tete penchee en dehors du vieuxfauteuil, sa main avait laisse tomber la plume et touchait presque aterre. La respiration saccadee que necessitait la posture du jeune hommeeffraya soudain Eugenie, qui entra promptement.--Il doit etre bien fatigue, se dit-elle en regardant une dizaine delettres cachetees, elle en lut les adresses: A messieurs Farry,Breilman et Cie, carrossiers.--A monsieur Buisson, tailleur, etc.--Il a sans doute arrange toutes ses affaires pour pouvoir bientotquitter la France, pensa-t-elle. Ses yeux tomberent sur deux lettresouvertes. Ces mots qui en commencaient une: "Ma chere Annette ..."luicauserent un eblouissement. Son coeur palpita, ses pieds se clouerent surle carreau. Sa chere Annette, il aime, il est aime! Plus d'espoir! Quelui dit-il? Ces idees lui traverserent la tete et le coeur. Elle lisaitces mots partout, meme sur les carreaux, en traits de flammes.--Deja renoncer a lui! Non, je ne lirai pas cette lettre. Je dois m'enaller. Si je la lisais, cependant? Elle regarda Charles, lui pritdoucement la tete, la posa sur le dos du fauteuil, et il se laissa fairecomme un enfant qui, meme en dormant, connait encore sa mere et recoit,sans s'eveiller, ses soins et ses baisers. Comme une mere, Eugeniereleva la main pendante, et, comme une mere, elle baisa doucement lescheveux. Chere Annette! Un demon lui criait ces deux mots aux oreilles.--Je sais que je fais peut-etre mal, mais je lirai la lettre, dit-elle.Eugenie detourna la tete, car sa noble probite gronda. Pour la premierefois de sa vie, le bien et le mal etaient en presence dans son coeur.Jusque-la elle n'avait eu a rougir d'aucune action. La passion, lacuriosite l'emporterent. A chaque phrase, son coeur se gonfla davantage,et l'ardeur piquante qui anima sa vie pendant cette lecture lui renditencore plus friands les plaisirs du premier amour."Ma chere Annette, rien ne devait nous separer, si ce n'est le malheurqui m'accable et qu'aucune prudence humaine n'aurait su prevoir. Monpere s'est tue, sa fortune et la mienne sont entierement perdues. Jesuis orphelin a un age ou, par la nature de mon education, je puispasser pour un enfant; et je dois neanmoins me relever homme de l'abimeou je suis tombe. Je viens d'employer une partie de cette nuit a fairemes calculs. Si je veux quitter la France en honnete homme, et ce n'estpas un doute, je n'ai pas cent francs a moi pour aller tenter le sortaux Indes ou en Amerique. Oui, ma pauvre Anna, j'irai chercher lafortune sous les climats les plus meurtriers. Sous de tels cieux, elleest sure et prompte, m'a-t-on dit. Quant a rester a Paris, je nesaurais. Ni mon ame ni mon visage ne sont faits a supporter lesaffronts, la froideur, le dedain qui attendent l'homme ruine, le fils dufailli! Bon Dieu! devoir deux millions?... J'y serais tue en duel dansla premiere semaine. Aussi n'y retournerai-je point. Ton amour, le plustendre et le plus devoue qui jamais ait ennobli le coeur d'un homme, nesaurait m'y attirer. Helas! ma bien-aimee, je n'ai point assez d'argentpour aller la ou tu es, donner, recevoir un dernier baiser, un baiser ouje puiserais la force necessaire a mon entreprise. "--Pauvre Charles, j'ai bien fait de lire! J'ai de l'or, je le luidonnerai, dit Eugenie.Elle reprit sa lecture apres avoir essuye ses pleurs."Je n'avais point encore songe aux malheurs de la misere. Si j'ai lescent louis indispensables au passage, je n'aurai pas un sou pour mefaire une pacotille. Mais non, je n'aurai ni cent louis ni un louis, jene connaitrai ce qui me restera d'argent qu'apres le reglement de mesdettes a Paris. Si je n'ai rien, j'irai tranquillement a Nantes, je m'yembarquerai simple matelot, et je commencerai la-bas comme ont commenceles hommes d'energie qui, jeunes, n'avaient pas un sou, et sont revenus,riches, des Indes. Depuis ce matin, j'ai froidement envisage mon avenir.Il est plus horrible pour moi que pour tout autre, moi choye par unemere qui m'adorait, cheri par le meilleur des peres, et qui, a mon debutdans le monde, ai rencontre l'amour d'une Anna! Je n'ai connu que lesfleurs de la vie: ce bonheur ne pouvait pas durer. J'ai neanmoins, machere Annette, plus de courage qu'il n'etait permis a un insouciantjeune homme d'en avoir, surtout a un jeune homme habitue aux cajoleriesde la plus delicieuse femme de Paris, berce dans les joies de lafamille, a qui tout souriait au logis, et dont les desirs etaient deslois pour un pere ... Oh! mon pere, Annette, il est mort ... Eh! bien,j'ai reflechi a ma position, j'ai reflechi a la tienne aussi. J'ai bienvieilli en vingt-quatre heures. Chere Anna, si, pour me garder pres detoi, dans Paris, tu sacrifiais toutes les jouissances de ton luxe, tatoilette, ta loge a l'Opera, nous n'arriverions pas encore au chiffredes depenses necessaires a ma vie dissipee; puis je ne saurais acceptertant de sacrifices. Nous nous quittons donc aujourd'hui pour toujours. "--Il la quitte, Sainte Vierge! Oh! bonheur!Eugenie sauta de joie. Charles fit un mouvement, elle en eut froid deterreur; mais, heureusement pour elle, il ne s'eveilla pas. Elle reprit:"Quand reviendrai-je? je ne sais. Le climat des Indes vieillitpromptement un Europeen, et surtout un Europeen qui travaille.Mettons-nous a dix ans d'ici. Dans dix ans, ta fille aura dix-huit ans,elle sera ta compagne, ton espion. Pour toi, le monde sera bien cruel,ta fille le sera peut-etre davantage. Nous avons vu des exemples de cesjugements mondains et de ces ingratitudes de jeunes filles; sachons enprofiter. Garde au fond de ton ame comme je le garderai moi-meme lesouvenir de ces quatre annees de bonheur, et sois fidele, si tu peux, aton pauvre ami. Je ne saurais toutefois l'exiger, parce que, vois-tu, machere Annette, je dois me conformer a ma position, voir bourgeoisementla vie, et la chiffrer au plus vrai. Donc je dois penser au mariage, quidevient une des necessites de ma nouvelle existence; et je t'avoueraique j'ai trouve ici, a Saumur, chez mon oncle, une cousine dont lesmanieres, la figure, l'esprit et le coeur te plairaient, et qui, enoutre, me parait avoir ... "--Il devait etre bien fatigue, pour avoir cesse de lui ecrire, se ditEugenie en voyant la lettre arretee au milieu de cette phrase.Elle le justifiait! N'etait-il pas impossible alors que cette innocentefille s'apercut de la froideur empreinte dans cette lettre? Aux jeunesfilles religieusement elevees, ignorantes et pures, tout est amour desqu'elles mettent le pied dans les regions enchantees de l'amour. Elles ymarchent entourees de la celeste lumiere que leur ame projette, et quirejaillit en rayons sur leur amant; elles le colorent des feux de leurpropre sentiment et lui pretent leurs belles pensees. Les erreurs de lafemme viennent presque toujours de sa croyance au bien, ou de saconfiance dans le vrai. Pour Eugenie, ces mots: Ma chere Annette, mabien-aimee, lui resonnaient au coeur comme le plus joli langage del'amour, et lui caressaient l'ame comme, dans son enfance, les notesdivines du _Venite adoremus_, redites par l'orgue, lui caresserentl'oreille. D'ailleurs, les larmes qui baignaient encore les yeux deCharles lui accusaient toutes les noblesses de coeur par lesquelles unejeune fille doit etre seduite. Pouvait-elle savoir que si Charles aimaittant son pere et le pleurait si veritablement, cette tendresse venaitmoins de la bonte de son coeur que des bontes paternelles? Monsieur etmadame Guillaume Grandet, en satisfaisant toujours les fantaisies deleur fils, en lui donnant tous les plaisirs de la fortune, l'avaientempeche de faire les horribles calculs dont sont plus ou moinscoupables, a Paris, la plupart des enfants quand, en presence desjouissances parisiennes, ils forment des desirs et concoivent des plansqu'ils voient avec chagrin incessamment ajournes et retardes par la viede leurs parents. La prodigalite du pere alla donc jusqu'a semer dans lecoeur de son fils un amour filial vrai, sans arriere-pensee. Neanmoins,Charles etait un enfant de Paris, habitue par les moeurs de Paris, parAnnette elle-meme, a tout calculer, deja vieillard sous le masque dujeune homme. Il avait recu l'epouvantable education de ce monde, ou,dans une soiree, il se commet en pensees, en paroles, plus de crimes quela Justice n'en punit aux Cours d'assises, ou les bons mots assassinentles plus grandes idees, ou l'on ne passe pour fort qu'autant que l'onvoit juste; et la, voir juste, c'est ne croire a rien, ni auxsentiments, ni aux hommes, ni meme aux evenements: on y fait de fauxevenements. La, pour voir juste, il faut peser, chaque matin, la boursed'un ami, savoir se mettre politiquement au-dessus de tout ce qui arrive;provisoirement, ne rien admirer, ni les oeuvres d'art, ni les noblesactions, et donner pour mobile a toute chose l'interet personnel. Apresmille folies, la grande dame, la belle Annette, forcait Charles a pensergravement; elle lui parlait de sa position future, en lui passant dansles cheveux une main parfumee; en lui refaisant une boucle, elle luifaisait calculer la vie: elle le feminisait et le materialisait. Doublecorruption, mais corruption elegante et fine, de bon gout.--Vous etes niais, Charles, lui disait-elle. J'aurai bien de la peine avous apprendre le monde. Vous avez ete tres mal pour monsieur desLupeaulx. Je sais bien que c'est un homme peu honorable; mais attendezqu'il soit sans pouvoir, alors vous le mepriserez a votre aise.Savez-vous ce que madame Campan nous disait?--Mes enfants, tant qu'un homme est au Ministere, adorez-le;tombe-t-il, aidez a le trainer a la voirie. Puissant, il est une especede dieu; detruit, il est au-dessous de Marat dans son egout, parcequ'il vit et que Marat etait mort. La vie est une suite de combinaisons,et il faut les etudier, les suivre, pour arriver a se maintenir toujoursen bonne position.Charles etait un homme trop a la mode, il avait ete trop constammentheureux par ses parents, trop adule par le monde pour avoir de grandssentiments. Le grain d'or que sa mere lui avait jete au coeur s'etaitetendu dans la filiere parisienne, il l'avait employe en superficie etdevait l'user par le frottement. Mais Charles n'avait encore que vingtet un ans. A cet age, la fraicheur de la vie semble inseparable de lacandeur de l'ame. La voix, le regard, la figure paraissent en harmonieavec les sentiments. Aussi le juge le plus dur, l'avoue le plusincredule, l'usurier le moins facile hesitent-ils toujours a croire a lavieillesse du coeur, a la corruption des calculs, quand les yeux nagentencore dans un fluide pur, et qu'il n'y a point de rides sur le front.Charles n'avait jamais eu l'occasion d'appliquer les maximes de lamorale parisienne, et jusqu'a ce jour il etait beau d'inexperience.Mais, a son insu, l'egoisme lui avait ete inocule. Les germes del'economie politique a l'usage du Parisien, latents en son coeur, nedevaient pas tarder a y fleurir, aussitot que de spectateur oisif ildeviendrait acteur dans le drame de la vie reelle. Presque toutes lesjeunes filles s'abandonnent aux douces promesses de ces dehors; maisEugenie eut-elle ete prudente et observatrice autant que le sontcertaines filles en province, aurait-elle pu se defier de son cousin,quand, chez lui, les manieres, les paroles et les actions s'accordaientencore avec les inspirations du coeur? Un hasard, fatal pour elle, luifit essuyer les dernieres effusions de sensibilite vraie qui fut en cejeune coeur, et entendre, pour ainsi dire, les derniers soupirs de laconscience. Elle laissa donc cette lettre pour elle pleine d'amour, etse mit complaisamment a contempler son cousin endormi: les fraichesillusions de la vie jouaient encore pour elle sur ce visage, elle sejura d'abord a elle-meme de l'aimer toujours. Puis elle jeta les yeuxsur l'autre lettre sans attacher beaucoup d'importance a cetteindiscretion, et, si elle commenca de la lire, ce fut pour acquerir denouvelles preuves des nobles qualites que, semblable a toutes lesfemmes, elle pretait a celui qu'elle choisissait."Mon cher, Alphonse, au moment ou tu liras cette lettre je n'aurai plusd'amis; mais je t'avoue qu'en doutant de ces gens du monde habitues aprodiguer ce mot, je n'ai pas doute de ton amitie. Je te charge doncd'arranger mes affaires, et compte sur toi, pour tirer un bon parti detout ce que je possede. Tu dois maintenant connaitre ma position. Jen'ai plus rien, et veux partir pour les Indes. Je viens d'ecrire atoutes les personnes auxquelles je crois devoir quelqu'argent, et tu entrouveras ci-joint la liste aussi exacte qu'il m'est possible de ladonner de memoire. Ma bibliotheque, mes meubles, mes voitures, meschevaux, etc., suffiront, je crois, a payer mes dettes. Je ne veux mereserver que les babioles sans valeur qui seront susceptibles de mefaire un commencement de pacotille. Mon cher Alphonse, je t'enverraid'ici, pour cette vente, une procuration reguliere, en cas decontestations. Tu m'adresseras toutes mes armes. Puis tu garderas pourtoi Briton. Personne ne voudrait donner le prix de cette admirable bete,j'aime mieux te l'offrir, comme la bague d'usage que legue un mourant ason executeur testamentaire. On m'a fait une tres _comfortable_ voiturede voyage chez les Farry, Breilman et Cie, mais ils ne l'ont pas livree,obtiens d'eux qu'ils la gardent sans me demander d'indemnite; s'ils serefusaient a cet arrangement, evite tout ce qui pourrait entacher maloyaute, dans les circonstances ou je me trouve. Je dois six louis al'insulaire, perdus au jeu, ne manque pas de les lui ... "--Cher cousin, dit Eugenie en laissant la lettre, et se sauvant a petitspas chez elle avec une des bougies allumees. La ce ne fut pas sans unevive emotion de plaisir qu'elle ouvrit le tiroir d'un vieux meuble enchene, l'un des plus beaux ouvrages de l'epoque nommee la _Renaissance_,et sur lequel se voyait encore, a demi effacee, la fameuse Salamandreroyale. Elle y prit une grosse bourse en velours rouge a glands d'or, etbordee de cannetille usee, provenant de la succession de sa grand'mere.Puis elle pesa fort orgueilleusement cette bourse, et se plut a verifierle compte oublie de son petit pecule. Elle separa d'abord vingtportugaises encore neuves, frappees sous le regne de Jean V, en 1725,valant reellement au change cinq lisbonines ou chacune centsoixante-huit francs soixante-quatre centimes, lui disait son pere, maisdont la valeur conventionnelle etait de cent quatre-vingts francs,attendu la rarete, la beaute desdites pieces qui reluisaient comme dessoleils. ITEM, cinq genovines ou pieces de cent livres de Genes, autremonnaie rare et valant quatre-vingt-sept francs au change, mais centfrancs pour les amateurs d'or. Elles lui venaient du vieux monsieur LaBertelliere. ITEM, trois quadruples d'or espagnols de Philippe V,frappes en 1729, donnes par madame Gentillet, qui, en les lui offrant,lui disait toujours la meme phrase:--Ce cher serin-la, ce petit jaunet, vaut quatre-vingt-dix-huit livres!Gardez-le bien, ma mignonne, ce sera la fleur de votre tresor. ITEM, ceque son pere estimait le plus (l'or de ces pieces etait a vingt-troiscarats et une fraction), cent ducats de Hollande, fabriques en l'an1756, et valant pres de treize francs. ITEM, une grande curiosite!...des especes de medailles precieuses aux avares, trois roupies au signede la Balance, et cinq roupies au signe de Vierge, toutes d'or pur avingt-quatre carats, la magnifique monnaie du Grand-Mogol, et dontchacune valait trente-sept francs quarante centimes au poids; mais aumoins cinquante francs pour les connaisseurs qui aiment a manier l'or.ITEM, le napoleon de quarante francs recu l'avant-veille, et qu'elleavait negligemment mis dans sa bourse rouge. Ce tresor contenait despieces neuves et vierges, de veritables morceaux d'art desquels le pereGrandet s'informait parfois et qu'il voulait revoir, afin de detailler asa fille les vertus intrinseques, comme la beaute du cordon, la clartedu plat, la richesse des lettres dont les vives aretes n'etaient pasencore rayees. Mais elle ne pensait ni a ces raretes, ni a la manie deson pere, ni au danger qu'il y avait pour elle de se demunir d'un tresorsi cher a son pere; non, elle songeait a son cousin, et parvint enfin acomprendre, apres quelques fautes de calcul, qu'elle possedait environcinq mille huit cents francs en valeurs reelles, qui, conventionnellement,pouvaient se vendre pres de deux mille ecus. A la vue de ses richesses,elle se mit a applaudir en battant des mains, comme un enfant force deperdre son trop plein de joie dans les naifs mouvements du corps. Ainsile pere et la fille avaient compte chacun leur fortune: lui, pour allervendre son or; Eugenie, pour jeter le sien dans un ocean d'affection.Elle remit les pieces dans la vieille bourse, la prit et remonta sanshesitation. La misere secrete de son cousin lui faisait oublier la nuit,les convenances; puis, elle etait forte de sa conscience, de sondevouement, de son bonheur. Au moment ou elle se montra sur le seuil dela porte, en tenant d'une main la bougie, de l'autre sa bourse, Charlesse reveilla, vit sa cousine et resta beant de surprise. Eugenies'avanca, posa le flambeau sur la table et dit d'une voix emue:--Mon cousin, j'ai a vous demander pardon d'une faute grave que j'aicommise envers vous; mais Dieu me le pardonnera, ce peche, si vousvoulez l'effacer.--Qu'est-ce donc? dit Charles en se frottant les yeux.--J'ai lu ces deux lettres.Charles rougit.--Comment cela s'est-il fait? reprit-elle, pourquoi suis-je montee? Enverite, maintenant je ne le sais plus. Mais, je suis tentee de ne pastrop me repentir d'avoir lu ces lettres, puisqu'elles m'ont faitconnaitre votre coeur, votre ame et ...--Et quoi? demanda Charles.--Et vos projets, la necessite ou vous etes d'avoir une somme ...--Ma chere cousine ...--Chut, chut, mon cousin, pas si haut, n'eveillons personne. Voici,dit-elle en ouvrant la bourse, les economies d'une pauvre fille qui n'abesoin de rien. Charles, acceptez-les. Ce matin, j'ignorais ce qu'etaitl'argent, vous me l'avez appris, ce n'est qu'un moyen, voila tout. Uncousin est presque un frere, vous pouvez bien emprunter la bourse devotre soeur.Eugenie, autant femme que jeune fille, n'avait pas prevu des refus, etson cousin restait muet.--Eh! bien, vous refuseriez? demanda Eugenie dont les palpitationsretentirent au milieu du profond silence.L'hesitation de son cousin l'humilia; mais la necessite dans laquelleil se trouvait se representa plus vivement a son esprit, et elle plia legenou.--Je ne me releverai pas que vous n'ayez pris cet or! dit-elle. Moncousin, de grace, une reponse?... que je sache si vous m'honorez, sivous etes genereux, si ...En entendant le cri d'un noble desespoir, Charles laissa tomber deslarmes sur les mains de sa cousine, qu'il saisit afin de l'empecher des'agenouiller. En recevant ces larmes chaudes, Eugenie sauta sur labourse, la lui versa sur la table.--Eh! bien, oui, n'est-ce pas? dit-elle en pleurant de joie. Necraignez rien, mon cousin, vous serez riche. Cet or vous portera bonheur;un jour vous me le rendrez; d'ailleurs, nous nous associerons; enfinje passerai par toutes les conditions que vous m'imposerez. Mais vousdevriez ne pas donner tant de prix a ce don.Charles put enfin exprimer ses sentiments.--Oui, Eugenie, j'aurais l'ame bien petite, si je n'acceptais pas.Cependant, rien pour rien, confiance pour confiance.--Que voulez-vous, dit-elle effrayee.--Ecoutez, ma chere cousine, j'ai la ... Il s'interrompit pour montrer surla commode une caisse carree enveloppee d'un surtout de cuir.--La, voyez-vous, une chose qui m'est aussi precieuse que la vie. Cetteboite est un present de ma mere. Depuis ce matin je pensais que, si ellepouvait sortir de sa tombe, elle vendrait elle-meme l'or que satendresse lui a fait prodiguer dans ce necessaire; mais, accomplie parmoi, cette action me paraitrait un sacrilege. Eugenie serraconvulsivement la main de son cousin en entendant ces derniers mots.--Non, reprit-il apres une legere pause, pendant laquelle tous deux ilsse jeterent un regard humide, non, je ne veux ni le detruire, ni lerisquer dans mes voyages. Chere Eugenie, vous en serez depositaire.Jamais ami n'aura confie quelque chose de plus sacre a son ami. Soyez-enjuge. Il alla prendre la boite, la sortit du fourreau, l'ouvrit etmontra tristement a sa cousine emerveillee un necessaire ou le travaildonnait a l'or un prix bien superieur a celui de son poids.--Ce que vous admirez n'est rien, dit-il en poussant un ressort qui fitpartir un double fond. Voila ce qui, pour moi, vaut la terre entiere. Iltira deux portraits, deux chefs-d'oeuvre de madame de Mirbel, richemententoures de perles.--Oh! la belle personne, n'est-ce pas cette dame a qui vous ecriv ...--Non, dit-il en souriant. Cette femme est ma mere, et voici mon pere,qui sont votre tante et votre oncle. Eugenie, je devrais vous supplier agenoux de me garder ce tresor. Si je perissais en perdant votre petitefortune, cet or vous dedommagerait; et, a vous seule, je puis laisserles deux portraits, vous etes digne de les conserver; maisdetruisez-les, afin qu'apres vous ils n'aillent pas en d'autres mains ...Eugenie se taisait.--He! bien, oui, n'est-ce pas? ajouta-t-il avec grace.En entendant les mots qu'elle venait de dire a son cousin, elle lui jetason premier regard de femme aimante, un de ces regards ou il y a presqueautant de coquetterie que de profondeur; il lui prit la main et labaisa.--Ange de purete! entre nous, n'est-ce pas?... l'argent ne sera jamaisrien. Le sentiment, qui en fait quelque chose, sera tout desormais.--Vous ressemblez a votre mere. Avait-elle la voix aussi douce que lavotre?--Oh! bien plus douce ...--Oui, pour vous, dit-elle en abaissant ses paupieres. Allons, Charles,couchez-vous, je le veux, vous etes fatigue. A demain.Elle degagea doucement sa main d'entre celles de son cousin, qui lareconduisit en l'eclairant. Quand ils furent tous deux sur le seuil dela porte:--Ah! pourquoi suis-je ruine, dit-il.--Bah! mon pere est riche, je le crois, repondit-elle.--Pauvre enfant, reprit Charles en avancant un pied dans la chambre ets'appuyant le dos au mur, il n'aurait pas laisse mourir le mien, il nevous laisserait pas dans ce denuement, enfin il vivrait autrement.--Mais il a Froidfond.--Et que vaut Froidfond?--Je ne sais pas; mais il a Noyers.--Quelque mauvaise ferme!--Il a des vignes et des pres ...--Des miseres, dit Charles d'un air dedaigneux. Si votre pere avaitseulement vingt-quatre mille livres de rente, habiteriez-vous cettechambre froide et nue? ajouta-t-il en avancant le pied gauche.--La seront donc mes tresors, dit-il en montrant le vieux bahut pourvoiler sa pensee.--Allez dormir, dit-elle en l'empechant d'entrer dans une chambre endesordre.Charles se retira, et ils se dirent bonsoir par un mutuel sourire.Tous deux ils s'endormirent dans le meme reve, et Charles commenca deslors a jeter quelques roses sur son deuil. Le lendemain matin, madameGrandet trouva sa fille se promenant avant le dejeuner en compagnie deCharles. Le jeune homme etait encore triste comme devait l'etre unmalheureux descendu pour ainsi dire au fond de ses chagrins, et qui, enmesurant la profondeur de l'abime ou il etait tombe, avait senti tout lepoids de sa vie future.--Mon pere ne reviendra que pour le diner, dit Eugenie en voyantl'inquietude peinte sur le visage de sa mere.Il etait facile de voir dans les manieres, sur la figure d'Eugenie etdans la singuliere douceur que contracta sa voix, une conformite depensee entre elle et son cousin. Leurs ames s'etaient ardemment epouseesavant peut-etre meme d'avoir bien eprouve la force des sentiments parlesquels ils s'unissaient l'un a l'autre. Charles resta dans la salle,et sa melancolie y fut respectee. Chacune des trois femmes eut as'occuper. Grandet ayant oublie ses affaires, il vint un assez grandnombre de personnes. Le couvreur, le plombier, le macon, lesterrassiers, le charpentier, des closiers, des fermiers, les uns pourconclure des marches relatifs a des reparations, les autres pour payerdes fermages ou recevoir de l'argent. Madame Grandet et Eugenie furentdonc obligees d'aller et de venir, de repondre aux interminablesdiscours des ouvriers et des gens de la campagne. Nanon encaissait lesredevances dans sa cuisine. Elle attendait toujours les ordres de sonmaitre pour savoir ce qui devait etre garde pour la maison ou vendu aumarche. L'habitude du bonhomme etait, comme celle d'un grand nombre degentilshommes campagnards, de boire son mauvais vin et de manger sesfruits gates. Vers cinq heures du soir, Grandet revint d'Angers ayant euquatorze mille francs de son or, et tenant dans son portefeuille desbons royaux qui lui portaient interet jusqu'au jour ou il aurait a payerses rentes. Il avait laisse Cornoiller a Angers, pour y soigner leschevaux a demi fourbus, et les ramener lentement apres les avoir bienfait reposer.--Je reviens d'Angers, ma femme, dit-il. J'ai faim.Nanon lui cria de la cuisine:--Est-ce que vous n'avez rien mange depuis hier?--Rien, repondit le bonhomme.Nanon apporta la soupe. Des Grassins vint prendre les ordres de sonclient au moment ou la famille etait a table. Le pere Grandet n'avaitseulement pas vu son neveu.--Mangez tranquillement, Grandet, dit le banquier. Nous causerons.Savez-vous ce que vaut l'or a Angers ou l'on en est venu chercher pourNantes? je vais en envoyer.--N'en envoyez pas, repondit le bonhomme, il y en a deja suffisamment.Nous sommes trop bons amis pour que je ne vous evite pas une perte detemps.--Mais l'or y vaut treize francs cinquante centimes.--Dites donc valait.--D'ou diable en serait-il venu?--Je suis alle cette nuit a Angers, lui repondit Grandet a voix basse.Le banquier tressaillit de surprise. Puis une conversation s'etablitentre eux d'oreille a oreille, pendant laquelle des Grassins et Grandetregarderent Charles a plusieurs reprises. Au moment ou sans doutel'ancien tonnelier dit au banquier de lui acheter cent mille livres derente, des Grassins laissa derechef echapper un geste d'etonnement.--Monsieur Grandet, dit-il a Charles, je pars pour Paris; et, si vousaviez des commissions a me donner ...--Aucune, monsieur. Je vous remercie, repondit Charles.--Remerciez-le mieux que ca, mon neveu. Monsieur va pour arranger lesaffaires de la maison Guillaume Grandet.--Y aurait-il donc quelque espoir, demanda Charles.--Mais, s'ecria le tonnelier avec un orgueil bien joue, n'etes-vous pasmon neveu? votre honneur est le notre. Ne vous nommez-vous pas Grandet?Charles se leva, saisit le pere Grandet, l'embrassa, palit et sortit.Eugenie contemplait son pere avec admiration.--Allons, adieu, mon bon des Grassins, tout a vous, et emboisez-moi biences gens-la! Les deux diplomates se donnerent une poignee de main,l'ancien tonnelier reconduisit le banquier jusqu'a la porte; puis,apres l'avoir fermee, il revint et dit a Nanon en se plongeant dans sonfauteuil:--Donne-moi du cassis? Mais trop emu pour rester en place, il se leva,regarda le portrait de monsieur de La Bertelliere et se mit a chanter,en faisant ce que Nanon appelait des pas de danse:Dans les gardes francaisesJ'avais un bon papa.Nanon, madame Grandet, Eugenie s'examinerent mutuellement et en silence.La joie du vigneron les epouvantait toujours quand elle arrivait a sonapogee. La soiree fut bientot finie. D'abord le pere Grandet voulut secoucher de bonne heure; et, lorsqu'il se couchait, chez lui tout devaitdormir; de meme que quand Auguste buvait la Pologne etait ivre. PuisNanon, Charles et Eugenie n'etaient pas moins las que le maitre. Quant amadame Grandet, elle dormait, mangeait, buvait, marchait suivant lesdesirs de son mari. Neanmoins, pendant les deux heures accordees a ladigestion, le tonnelier, plus facetieux qu'il ne l'avait jamais ete, ditbeaucoup de ses apophtegmes particuliers, dont un seul donnera la mesurede son esprit. Quand il eut avale son cassis, il regarda le verre.--On n'a pas plutot mis les levres a un verre qu'il est deja vide!Voila notre histoire. On ne peut pas etre et avoir ete. Les ecus nepeuvent pas rouler et rester dans votre bourse, autrement la vie seraittrop belle.Il fut jovial et clement. Lorsque Nanon vint avec son rouet:--Tu dois etre lasse, lui dit-il. Laisse ton chanvre.--Ah! ben!... quien, je m'ennuierais, repondit la servante.--Pauvre Nanon! Veux-tu du cassis?--Ah! pour du cassis, je ne dis pas non; madame le fait ben mieux queles apothicaires. Celui qu'i vendent est de la drogue.--Ils y mettent trop de sucre, ca ne sent plus rien, dit le bonhomme.Le lendemain la famille, reunie a huit heures pour le dejeuner, offritle tableau de la premiere scene d'une intimite bien reelle. Le malheuravait promptement mis en rapport madame Grandet, Eugenie et Charles;Nanon elle-meme sympathisait avec eux sans le savoir. Tous quatrecommencerent a faire une meme famille. Quant au vieux vigneron, sonavarice satisfaite et la certitude de voir bientot partir le mirliflorsans avoir a lui payer autre chose que son voyage a Nantes, le rendirentpresque indifferent a sa presence au logis. Il laissa les deux enfants,ainsi qu'il nomma Charles et Eugenie, libres de se comporter comme bonleur semblerait sous l'oeil de madame Grandet, en laquelle il avaitd'ailleurs une entiere confiance en ce qui concernait la morale publiqueet religieuse. L'alignement de ses pres et des fosses jouxtant la route,ses plantations de peupliers en Loire et les travaux d'hiver dans sesclos et a Froidfond l'occuperent exclusivement. Des lors commenca pourEugenie le primevere de l'amour. Depuis la scene de nuit pendantlaquelle la cousine donna son tresor au cousin, son coeur avait suivi letresor. Complices tous deux du meme secret, ils se regardaient ens'exprimant une mutuelle intelligence qui approfondissait leurssentiments et les leur rendait mieux communs, plus intimes, en lesmettant pour ainsi dire, tous deux en dehors de la vie ordinaire. Laparente n'autorisait-elle pas une certaine douceur dans l'accent, unetendresse dans les regards: aussi Eugenie se plut-elle a endormir lessouffrances de son cousin dans les joies enfantines d'un naissant amour.N'y a-t-il pas de gracieuses similitudes entre les commencements del'amour et ceux de la vie? Ne berce-t-on pas l'enfant par de douxchants et de gentils regards? Ne lui dit-on pas de merveilleuseshistoires qui lui dorent l'avenir? Pour lui l'esperance nedeploie-t-elle pas incessamment ses ailes radieuses? Ne verse-t-il pastour a tour des larmes de joie et de douleur? Ne se querelle-t-il paspour des riens, pour des cailloux avec lesquels il essaie de se batir unmobile palais, pour des bouquets aussitot oublies que coupes? N'est-ilpas avide de saisir le temps, d'avancer dans la vie? L'amour est notreseconde transformation. L'enfance et l'amour furent meme chose entreEugenie et Charles: ce fut la passion premiere avec tous sesenfantillages, d'autant plus caressants pour leurs coeurs qu'ils etaientenveloppes de melancolie. En se debattant a sa naissance sous les crepesdu deuil, cet amour n'en etait d'ailleurs que mieux en harmonie avec lasimplicite provinciale de cette maison en ruines. En echangeant quelquesmots avec sa cousine au bord du puits, dans cette cour muette; enrestant dans ce jardinet, assis sur un banc moussu jusqu'a l'heure ou lesoleil se couchait, occupes a se dire de grands riens ou recueillis dansle calme qui regnait entre le rempart et la maison, comme on l'est sousles arcades d'une eglise, Charles comprit la saintete de l'amour; carsa grande dame, sa chere Annette ne lui en avait fait connaitre que lestroubles orageux. Il quittait en ce moment la passion parisienne,coquette, vaniteuse, eclatante, pour l'amour pur et vrai. Il aimaitcette maison, dont les moeurs ne lui semblerent plus si ridicules. Ildescendait des le matin afin de pouvoir causer avec Eugenie quelquesmoments avant que Grandet ne vint donner les provisions; et, quand lespas du bonhomme retentissaient dans les escaliers, il se sauvait aujardin. La petite criminalite de ce rendez-vous matinal, secret memepour la mere d'Eugenie, et que Nanon faisait semblant de ne pasapercevoir, imprimait a l'amour le plus innocent du monde la vivacitedes plaisirs defendus. Puis, quand, apres le dejeuner, le pere Grandetetait parti pour aller voir ses proprietes et ses exploitations, Charlesdemeurait entre la mere et la fille, eprouvant des delices inconnues aleur preter les mains pour devider du fil, a les voir travaillant, a lesentendre jaser La simplicite de cette vie presque monastique, qui luirevela les beautes de ces ames auxquelles le monde etait inconnu, letoucha vivement. Il avait cru ces moeurs impossibles en France, etn'avait admis leur existence qu'en Allemagne, encore n'etait-ce quefabuleusement et dans les romans d'Auguste Lafontaine. Bientot pour luiEugenie fut l'ideal de la Marguerite de Goethe, moins la faute. Enfin dejour en jour ses regards, ses paroles ravirent la pauvre fille, quis'abandonna delicieusement au courant de l'amour; elle saisissait safelicite comme un nageur saisit la branche de saule pour se tirer dufleuve et se reposer sur la rive. Les chagrins d'une prochaine absencen'attristaient-ils pas deja les heures les plus joyeuses de ces fuyardesjournees? Chaque jour un petit evenement leur rappelait la prochaineseparation. Ainsi, trois jours apres le depart de des Grassins, Charlesfut emmene par Grandet au Tribunal de Premiere Instance avec lasolennite que les gens de province attachent a de tels actes, pour ysigner une renonciation a la succession de son pere. Repudiationterrible! espece d'apostasie domestique. Il alla chez maitre Cruchotfaire faire deux procurations, l'une pour des Grassins, l'autre pourl'ami charge de vendre son mobilier. Puis il fallut remplir lesformalites necessaires pour obtenir un passeport a l'etranger. Enfin,quand arriverent les simples vetements de deuil que Charles avaitdemandes a Paris, il fit venir un tailleur de Saumur et lui vendit sagarde-robe inutile. Cet acte plut singulierement au pere Grandet.--Ah! vous voila comme un homme qui doit s'embarquer et qui veut fairefortune, lui dit-il en le voyant vetu d'une redingote de gros drap noir.Bien, tres bien!--Je vous prie de croire, monsieur, lui repondit Charles, que je sauraibien avoir l'esprit de ma situation.--Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela? dit le bonhomme dont les yeuxs'animerent a la vue d'une poignee d'or que lui montra Charles.--Monsieur, j'ai reuni mes boutons, mes anneaux, toutes les superfluitesque je possede et qui pouvaient avoir quelque valeur; mais, neconnaissant personne a Saumur, je voulais vous prier ce matin de ...--De vous acheter cela? dit Grandet en l'interrompant.--Non, mon oncle, de m'indiquer un honnete homme qui ...--Donnez-moi cela, mon neveu; j'irai vous estimer cela la-haut, et jereviendrai vous dire ce que cela vaut, a un centime pres. Or de bijou,dit-il en examinant une longue chaine, dix-huit a dix-neuf carats.Le bonhomme tendit sa large main et emporta la masse d'or.--Ma cousine, dit Charles, permettez-moi de vous offrir ces deux boutonsqui pourront vous servir a attacher des rubans a vos poignets. Cela faitun bracelet fort a la mode en ce moment.--J'accepte sans hesiter, mon cousin, dit-elle en lui jetant un regardd'intelligence.--Ma tante, voici le de de ma mere, je le gardais precieusement dans matoilette de voyage, dit Charles en presentant un joli de d'or a madameGrandet qui depuis dix ans en desirait un.--Il n'y a pas de remerciments possibles, mon neveu, dit la vieille meredont les yeux se mouillerent de larmes. Soir et matin dans mes prieresj'ajouterai la plus pressante de toutes pour vous, en disant celle desvoyageurs. Si je mourais, Eugenie vous conserverait ce bijou.--Cela vaut neuf cent quatre-vingt-neuf francs soixante-quinze centimes,mon neveu, dit Grandet en ouvrant la porte. Mais, pour vous eviter lapeine de vendre cela, je vous en compterai l'argent ... en livres.Le mot en livres signifie sur le littoral de la Loire que les ecus desix livres doivent etre acceptes pour six francs sans deduction.--Je n'osais vous le proposer, repondit Charles; mais il me repugnaitde brocanter mes bijoux dans la ville que vous habitez. Il faut laverson linge sale en famille, disait Napoleon. Je vous remercie donc devotre complaisance. Grandet se gratta l'oreille, et il y eut un momentde silence.--Mon cher oncle, reprit Charles en le regardant d'un air inquiet commes'il eut craint de blesser sa susceptibilite, ma cousine et ma tante ontbien voulu accepter un faible souvenir de moi; veuillez a votre touragreer des boutons de manche qui me deviennent inutiles: ils vousrappelleront un pauvre garcon qui, loin de vous, pensera certes a ceuxqui desormais seront toute sa famille.--Mon garcon! mon garcon, faut pas te denuer comme ca ... Qu'as-tu donc,ma femme? dit-il en se tournant avec avidite vers elle, ah! un ded'or. Et toi, fifille, tiens, des agrafes de diamants. Allons, je prendstes boutons, mon garcon, reprit-il en serrant la main de Charles. Mais... tu me permettras de ... te payer ... ton, oui ... ton passage auxIndes. Oui, je veux te payer ton passage. D'autant, vois-tu, garcon,qu'en estimant tes bijoux, je n'en ai compte que l'or brut, il y apeut-etre quelque chose a gagner sur les facons. Ainsi, voila qui estdit. Je te donnerai quinze cents francs ... en livres, que Cruchot mepretera; car je n'ai pas un rouge liard ici, a moins que Perrottet, quiest en retard de son fermage, ne me le paye. Tiens, tiens, je vaisl'aller voir.Il prit son chapeau, mit ses gants et sortit.--Vous vous en irez donc, dit Eugenie en lui jetant un regard detristesse melee d'admiration.--Il le faut, dit-il en baissant la tete.Depuis quelques jours, le maintien, les manieres, les paroles de Charlesetaient devenus ceux d'un homme profondement afflige, mais qui, sentantpeser sur lui d'immenses obligations, puise un nouveau courage dans sonmalheur. Il ne soupirait plus, il s'etait fait homme. Aussi jamaisEugenie ne presuma-t-elle mieux du caractere de son cousin, qu'en levoyant descendre dans ses habits de gros drap noir, qui allaient bien asa figure palie et a sa sombre contenance. Ce jour-la le deuil fut prispar les deux femmes, qui assisterent avec Charles a un Requiem celebre ala paroisse pour l'ame de feu Guillaume Grandet.Au second dejeuner, Charles recut des lettres de Paris, et les lut.--He! bien, mon cousin, etes-vous content de vos affaires? dit Eugeniea voix basse.--Ne fais donc jamais de ces questions-la, ma fille, repondit Grandet.Que diable, je ne te dis pas les miennes, pourquoi fourres-tu le nezdans celles de ton cousin? Laisse-le donc, ce garcon.--Oh! je n'ai point de secrets, dit Charles.--Ta, ta, ta, mon neveu, tu sauras qu'il faut tenir sa langue en bridedans le commerce.Quand les deux amants furent seuls dans le jardin, Charles dit a Eugenieen l'attirant sur le vieux banc ou ils s'assirent sous le noyer:--J'avais bien presume d'Alphonse, il s'est conduit a merveille. Il afait mes affaires avec prudence et loyaute. Je ne dois rien a Paris,tous mes meubles sont bien vendus, et il m'annonce avoir, d'apres lesconseils d'un capitaine au long-cours, employe trois mille francs quilui restaient en une pacotille composee de curiosites europeennesdesquelles on tire un excellent parti aux Indes. Il a dirige mes colissur Nantes, ou se trouve un navire
