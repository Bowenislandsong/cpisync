 which she dwells, where hospitality can never enter, and whereinterest takes the management instead of affection.  At tea theyall meet again, and a little trickery is perceptible to a niceobserver in the manner of partaking the pound-cake, &c.  Afterthis, those who are happy enough to have engagements hasten tokeep them; those who have not, either mount again to the solitudeof their chamber, or, what appeared to me much worse, remain inthe common sitting-room, in a society cemented by no tie,endeared by no connexion, which choice did not bring together,and which the slightest motive would break asunder.  I remarkedthat the gentlemen were generally obliged to go out everyevening on business, and, I confess, the arrangement did notsurprise me.It is not thus that the women can obtain that influence insociety which is allowed to them in Europe, and to which, bothsages and men of the world have agreed in ascribing such salutaryeffects.  It is in vain that "collegiate institutes" are formedfor young ladies, or that "academic degrees" are conferred uponthem.  It is after marriage, and when these young attempts uponall the sciences are forgotten, that the lamentableinsignificance of the American woman appears, and till this beremedied, I venture to prophesy that the tone of theirdrawing-rooms will not improve.Whilst I was at Philadelphia a great deal of attention wasexcited by the situation of two criminals, who had been convictedof robbing the Baltimore mail, and were lying under sentence ofdeath.  The rare occurrence of capital punishment in Americamakes it always an event of great interest; and the approachingexecution was repeatedly the subject of conversation at theboarding table.  One day a gentleman told us he had that morningbeen assured that one of the criminals had declared to thevisiting clergyman that he was certain of being reprieved, andthat nothing the clergyman could say to the contrary made anyimpression upon him.  Day after day this same story was repeated,and commented upon at table, and it appeared that the report hadbeen heard in so many quarters, that not only was the statementreceived as true, but it began to be conjectured that the criminalhad some ground for his hope.  I learnt from these dailyconversations that one of the prisoners was an American, and theother an Irishman, and it was the former who was so stronglypersuaded he should not be hanged.  Several of the gentlemen attable, in canvassing the subject, declared, that if the one werehanged and the other spared, this hanging would be a murder, andnot a legal execution.  In discussing this point, it was statedthat very nearly all the white men who had suffered death sincethe declaration of Independence had been Irishmen.  What truththere may be in this general statement, I have no means ofascertaining; all I know is, that I heard it made.  On thisoccasion, however, the Irishman was hanged, and the Americanwas not.CHAPTER 27Return to Stonington--Thunderstorm--Emigrants--Illness--AlexandriaA fortnight passed rapidly away in this great city, and,doubtless, there was still much left unseen when we quitted it,according to previous arrangement, to return to our friends inMaryland.  We came back by a different route, going by land fromNewcastle to French Town, instead of passing by the canal.  Wereached Baltimore in the middle of the night, but finished ourrepose on board the steam-boat, and started for Washington atfive o'clock the next morning.Our short abode amid the heat and closeness of a city made usenjoy more than ever the beautiful scenery around Stonington.The autumn, which soon advanced upon us, again clothed the woodsin colours too varied and gaudy to be conceived by those who havenever quitted Europe; and the stately maize, waving its flowingtassels, as the long drooping blossoms are called, made everyfield look like a little forest.  A rainy spring had beenfollowed by a summer of unusual heat; and towards the autumnfrequent thunderstorms of terrific violence cleared the air, butat the same time frightened us almost out of our wits.  On oneoccasion I was exposed, with my children, to the full fury ofone of these awful visitations.  We suffered considerableterror during this storm, but when we were all again safe, andcomfortably sheltered, we rejoiced that the accident hadoccurred, as it gave us the best possible opportunity ofwitnessing, in all its glory, a transatlantic thunderstorm.  Itwas, however, great imprudence that exposed us to it, for wequitted the house, and mounted a hill at a considerable distancefrom it, for the express purpose of watching to advantage theextraordinary aspect of the clouds.  When we reached the top ofthe hill half the heavens appeared hung with a heavy curtain; asort of deep blue black seemed to colour the very air; theblizzards screamed, as with heavy wing they sought the earth.  Weought, in common prudence, to have immediately retreated to thehouse, but the scene was too beautiful to be left.  For severalminutes after we reached our station, the air appeared perfectlywithout movement, no flash broke through the seven-fold cloud,but a flickering light was visible, darting to and fro behind it.By degrees the thunder rolled onward, nearer and nearer, tillthe inky cloud burst asunder, and cataracts of light came pouringfrom behind it.  From that moment there was no interval, nopause, the lightning did not flash, there were no claps ofthunder, but the heavens blazed and bellowed above and around us,till stupor took the place of terror, and we stood utterlyconfounded.  But we were speedily aroused, for suddenly, as iffrom beneath our feet, a gust arose which threatened to mix allthe elements in one.  Torrents of water seemed to bruise theearth by their violence; eddies of thick dust rose up to meetthem; the fierce fires of heaven only blazed the brighter for thefalling flood; while the blast almost out-roared the thunder.But the wind was left at last the lord of all, for after strikingwith wild force, now here, now there, and bringing worlds ofclouds together in most hostile contact, it finished by clearingthe wide heavens of all but a few soft straggling masses, whencesprung a glorious rainbow, and then retired, leaving the earth toraise her half crushed forests; and we, poor pigmies, to callback our frighted senses, and recover breath as we might.During this gust, it would have been impossible for us to havekept our feet; we crouched down under the shelter of a heap ofstones, and, as we informed each other, looked most dismallypale.Many trees were brought to the earth before our eyes; some tornup by the roots, and some mighty stems snapt off several feetfrom the ground.  If the West Indian hurricanes exceed this, theymust be terrible indeed.The situation of Mrs. S--'s house was considered as remarkablyhealthy, and I believe justly so, for on more than one occasion,persons who were suffering from fever and ague at the distance ofa mile or two, were perfectly restored by passing a week orfortnight at Stonington; but the neighbourhood of it,particularly on the side bordering the Potomac, was muchotherwise, and the mortality among the labourers on the canalwas frightful.I have elsewhere stated my doubts if the labouring poor of ourcountry mend their condition by emigrating to the United States,but it was not till the opportunity which a vicinity to theChesapeake and Ohio canal gave me, of knowing what theirsituation was after making the change, that I became fully awarehow little it was to be desired for them.Of the white labourers on this canal, the great majority areIrishmen; their wages are from ten to fifteen dollars a month,with a miserable lodging, and a large allowance of whiskey.  Itis by means of this hateful poison that they are tempted, andindeed enabled for a time, to stand the broiling heat of the sunin a most noxious climate: for through such, close to theromantic but unwholesome Potomac, the line of the canal hashitherto run.  The situation of these poor strangers, when theysink at last in "_the fever,_" which sooner or later is sure toovertake them, is dreadful.  There is a strong feeling againstthe Irish in every part of the Union, but they will do twice asmuch work as a negro, and therefore they are employed.  Whenthey fall sick, they may, and must, look with envy on the slavesaround them; for they are cared for; they are watched andphysicked, as a valuable horse is watched and physicked: not sothe Irishman, he is literally thrown on one side, and a newcomer takes his place. Details of their sufferings, and unheededdeath, too painful to dwell upon, often reached us; on oneoccasion a farmer calling at the house, told the family that apoor man, apparently in a dying condition, was lying beside alittle brook at the distance of a quarter of a mile.  The spotwas immediately visited by some of the family, and there intruth lay a poor creature, who was already past the power ofspeaking; he was conveyed to the house and expired during thenight.  By enquiring at the canal, it was found that he was anIrish labourer, who having fallen sick, and spent his last cent,had left the stifling shanty where he lay, in the desperateattempt of finding his way to Washington, with what hope I knownot.  He did not appear above twenty, and as I looked on hispale young face, which even in death expressed suffering, Ithought that perhaps he had left a mother and a home to seekwealth in America.  I saw him buried under a group of locusttrees, his very name unknown to those who laid him there, butthe attendance of the whole family at the grave, gave a sort ofdecency to his funeral which rarely, in that country, honors thepoor relics of British dust: but no clergyman attended, noprayer was said, no bell was tolled; these, indeed, areceremonies unthought of, and in fact unattainable without muchexpense, at such a distance from a town; had the poor youth beenan American, he would have been laid in the earth in the sameunceremonious manner.  But had this poor Irish lad fallen sickin equal poverty and destitution among his own people, he wouldhave found a blanket to wrap his shivering limbs, and a kindredhand to close his eyes.The poor of great Britain, whom distress, or a spirit ofenterprise tempt to try another land, ought, for many reasons,to repair to Canada; there they would meet co-operation andsympathy, instead of malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness.I frequently heard vehement complaints, and constantly met thesame in the newspapers, of a practice stated to be very generallyadopted in Britain of sending out cargoes of parish paupers tothe United States.  A Baltimore paper heads some such remarkswith the words                    "INFAMOUS CONDUCT!"and then tells us of a cargo of aged paupers just arrived fromEngland, adding, "John Bull has squeezed the orange, and nowinsolently casts the skin in our faces."  Such being the feeling,it will be readily believed that these unfortunates are notlikely to meet much kindness or sympathy in sickness, or insuffering of any kind.  If these American statements be correct,and that different parishes are induced, from an excessivepopulation, to pay the voyage and outfit of some of their paupersacross the Atlantic, why not send them to Canada?It is certain, however, that all the enquiries I could makefailed to substantiate these American statements.  All I couldascertain was, that many English and Irish poor arrived yearly inthe United States, with no other resources than what their labourfurnished.  This, though very different from the newspaperstories, is quite enough to direct attention to the subject.  Itis generally acknowledged that the suffering among our labouringclasses arises from the excess of our population; and it isimpossible to see such a country as Canada, its extent, itsfertility, its fine climate, and know that it is British ground,without feeling equal sorrow and astonishment that it is not madethe means of relief.  How earnestly it is to be wished that somepart of that excellent feeling which is for ever at work inEngland to help the distressed, could be directed systematicallyto the object of emigration to the Canadas.  Large sums areannually raised for charitable purposes, by weekly subscriptionsof one penny; were only a part of the money so obtained to bedevoted to this object, hundreds of families might yearly be sentto people our own land.  The religious feeling, which sonaturally mixes with every charitable purpose, would there findthe best field for its exertions.  Where could a missionary,whether Protestant or Catholic, find a holier mission than thatwhich sent him to comfort and instruct his countrymen in thewilderness? or where could he reap a higher reward in this world,than seeing that wilderness growing into fertile fields under thehands of his flock?I never saw so many autumn flowers as grow in the woods andsheep-walks of Maryland; a second spring seemed to clothe thefields, but with grief and shame I confess, that of theseprecious blossoms I scarcely knew a single name.  I think theMichaelmas daisy, in wonderful variety of form and colour, andthe prickly pear, were almost my only acquaintance: let no onevisit America without having first studied botany; it is anamusement, as a clever friend of mine once told me, that helpsone wonderfully up and down hill, and must be superlativelyvaluable in America, both from the plentiful lack of otheramusements, and the plentiful material for enjoyment in this;besides, if one is dying to know the name of any of these lovelystrangers, it is a thousand to one against his finding any onewho can tell it.The prettiest eclipse of the moon I ever saw was that ofSeptember, of this year, (1830).  We had been passing some hoursamid the solemn scenery of the Potomac falls, and just as we werepreparing to quit it, the full moon arose above the black pines,with half our shadow thrown across her.  The effect of her risingthus eclipsed was more strange, more striking by far, thanwatching the gradual obscuration; and as I turned to look at theblack chasm behind me, and saw the deadly alder, and thepoison-vine waving darkly on the rocks around, I thought thescene wanted nothing but the figure of a palsied crone, pluckingthe fatal branches to concoct some charm of mischief.Whether some such maga dogged my steps, I know not, but manyhours had not elapsed ere I again felt the noxious influence ofan American autumn.  This fever, "built in th' eclipse," speedilybrought me very low, and though it lasted not so long as that ofthe preceding year, I felt persuaded I should never recover fromit.  Though my forebodings were not verified by the event, it wasdeclared that change of air was necessary, and it was arrangedfor me, (for I was perfectly incapable of settling any thing formyself,) that I should go to Alexandria, a pretty town at thedistance of about fifteen miles, which had the reputation ofpossessing a skilful physician.It was not without regret that we quitted our friends atStonington; but the prescription proved in a great degreeefficacious; a few weeks' residence in Alexandria restored mystrength sufficiently to enable me to walk to a beautiful littlegrassy terrace, perfectly out of the town, but very near it, fromwhence we could watch the various craft that peopled the Potomacbetween Alexandria and Washington.  But though graduallyregaining strength, I was still far from well; all plans forwinter gaiety were abandoned, and finding ourselves very wellaccommodated, we decided upon passing the winter where we were.It proved unusually severe; the Potomac was so completely frozenas to permit considerable traffic to be carried on by carts,crossing on the ice, from Maryland.  This had not occurred beforefor thirty years.  The distance was a mile and a quarter, and weventured to brave the cold, and walk across this bright andslippery mirror, to make a visit on the opposite shore; thefatigue of keeping our feet was by no means inconsiderable, butwe were rewarded by seeing as noble a winter landscape around usas the eye could look upon.When at length the frost gave way, the melting snow producedfreshes so violent as to carry away the long bridge atWashington; large fragments of it, with the railing still erect,came floating down amidst vast blocks of ice, during manysuccessive days, and it was curious to see the intrepidity withwhich the young sailors of Alexandria periled their lives tomake spoil of the timber.The solar eclipse of the 12th of February, 1831, was nearer totalthan any I ever saw, or ever shall see.  It was completelyannular at Alexandria, and the bright ring which surrounded themoon's shadow, though only 81 deg. in breadth, gave light sufficientto read the smallest print; the darkness was considerablylessened by the snow, which, as the day was perfectly unclouded,reflected brightly all the light that was left us.Notwithstanding the extreme cold, we passed the whole time in theopen air, on a rising ground near the river; in this positionmany beautiful effects were perceptible; the rapid approach andchange of shadows, the dusky hue of the broad Potomac, thatseemed to drink in the feeble light, which its snow-covered banksgave back to the air, the gradual change of every object from thecolouring of bright sunshine to one sad universal tint of dingypurple, the melancholy lowing of the cattle, and the short, butremarkable suspension of all labour, gave something of mysteryand awe to the scene that we shall long remember.During the following months I occupied myself partly in revisingmy notes, and arranging these pages; and partly in making myselfacquainted, as much as possible, with the literature of thecountry.While reading and transcribing my notes, I underwent a strictself-examination.  I passed in review all I had seen, all I hadfelt, and scrupulously challenged every expression ofdisapprobation; the result was, that I omitted in transcriptionmuch that I had written, as containing unnecessary details ofthings which had displeased me; yet, as I did so, I felt stronglythat there was no exaggeration in them; but such details, thoughtrue, might be ill-natured, and I retained no more than werenecessary to convey the general impressions received.  While thusreviewing my notes, I discovered that many points, which allscribbling travellers are expected to notice, had been omitted;but a few pages of miscellaneous observations will, I think,supply all that can be expected from so idle a pen.CHAPTER 28American Cooking--Evening Parties--Dress--Sleighing--Money-getting Habits--Tax-Gatherer's Notice--IndianSummer--Anecdote of the Duke of Saxe-WeimarIn relating all I know of America, I surely must not omit soimportant a feature as the cooking.  There are sundry anomaliesin the mode of serving even a first-rate table; but as these arealtogether matters of custom, they by no means indicate eitherindifference or neglect in this important business; and whethercastors are placed on the table or on the sideboard; whethersoup, fish, patties, and salad be eaten in orthodox order or not,signifies but little.  I am hardly capable, I fear, of giving avery erudite critique on the subject; general observationstherefore must suffice.  The ordinary mode of living is abundant,but not delicate.  They consume an extraordinary quantity ofbacon.  Ham and beaf-steaks appear morning, noon, and night.  Ineating, they mix things together with the strangest incongruityimaginable.  I have seen eggs and oysters eaten together: thesempiternal ham with apple-sauce; beefsteak with stewed peaches;and salt fish with onions.  The bread is everywhere excellent,but they rarely enjoy it themselves, as they insist upon eatinghorrible half-baked hot rolls both morning and evening.  Thebutter is tolerable; but they have seldom such cream as everylittle dairy produces in England; in fact, the cows are veryroughly kept, compared with our's.  Common vegetables areabundant and very fine.  I never saw sea-cale or cauliflowers,and either from the want of summer rain, or the want of care, theharvest of green vegetables is much sooner over than with us.They eat the Indian corn in a great variety of forms; sometimesit is dressed green, and eaten like peas; sometimes it is brokento pieces when dry, boiled plain, and brought to table like rice;this dish is called hominy.  The flour of it is made into atleast a dozen different sorts of cakes; but in my opinion allbad.  This flour, mixed in the proportion of one-third with finewheat, makes by far the best bread I ever tasted.I never saw turbot, salmon, or fresh cod; but the rock and shadare excellent.  There is a great want of skill in the compositionof sauces; not only with fish, but with every thing.  They usevery few made dishes, and I never saw any that would be approvedby our savants.  They have an excellent wild duck, called theCanvass Back, which, if delicately served, would surpass theblack cock; but the game is very inferior to our's; they have nohares, and I never saw a pheasant.  They seldom indulge in secondcourses, with all their ingenious temptations to the eating asecond dinner; but almost every table has its dessert,(invariably pronounced desart) which is placed on the tablebefore the cloth is removed, and consists of pastry, preservedfruits, and creams.  They are "extravagantly fond," to use theirown phrase, of puddings, pies, and all kinds of "sweets,"particularly the ladies; but are by no means such connoisseurs insoups and ragouts as the gastronomes of Europe.  Almost every onedrinks water at table, and by a strange contradiction, in thecountry where hard drinking is more prevalent than in any other,there is less wine taken at dinner; ladies rarely exceed oneglass, and the great majority of females never take any.  Infact, the hard drinking, so universally acknowledged, does nottake place at jovial dinners, but, to speak plain English, insolitary dram-drinking.  Coffee is not served immediately afterdinner, but makes part of the serious matter of tea-drinking,which comes some hours later.  Mixed dinner parties of ladies andgentlemen are very rare, and unless several foreigners arepresent, but little conversation passes at table.  It certainlydoes not, in my opinion, add to the well ordering a dinner table,to set the gentlemen at one end of it, and the ladies at theother; but it is very rarely that you find it otherwise.Their large evening parties are supremely dull; the men sometimesplay cards by themselves, but if a lady plays, it must not be formoney; no ecarte, no chess; very little music, and that littlelamentably bad.  Among the blacks, I heard some good voices,singing in tune; but I scarcely ever heard a white American, maleor female, go through an air without being out of tune before theend of it; nor did I ever meet any trace of science in thesinging I heard in society.  To eat inconceivable quantities ofcake, ice, and pickled oysters--and to show half their revenue insilks and satins, seem to be the chief object they have in theseparties.The most agreeable meetings, I was assured by all the youngpeople, were those to which no married women are admitted; of thetruth of this statement I have not the least doubt.  Theseexclusive meetings occur frequently, and often last to a latehour; on these occasions, I believe, they generally dance.  Atregular balls, married ladies are admitted, but seldom take muchpart in the amusement.  The refreshments are always profuse andcostly, but taken in a most uncomfortable manner.  I have knownmany private balls, where every thing was on the most liberalscale of expense, where the gentlemen sat down to supper in oneroom, while the ladies took theirs, standing, in another.What we call picnics are very rare, and when attempted, do notoften succeed well.  The two sexes can hardly mix for the greaterpart of a day without great restraint and ennui; it is quitecontrary to their general habits; the favourite indulgences ofthe gentlemen (smoking cigars and drinking spirits), can neitherbe indulged in with decency, nor resigned with complacency.The ladies have strange ways of adding to their charms.  Theypowder themselves immoderately, face, neck, and arms, withpulverised starch; the effect is indescribably disagreeable bydaylight, and not very favourable at any time.  They are alsomost unhappily partial to false hair, which they wear insurprising quantities; this is the more to be lamented, as theygenerally have very fine hair of their own.  I suspect thisfashion to arise from an indolent mode of making their toilet,and from accomplished ladies' maids not being very abundant; itis less trouble to append a bunch of waving curls here, there,and every where, than to keep their native tresses in perfectorder.Though the expense of the ladies' dress greatly exceeds, inproportion to their general style of living, that of the ladiesof Europe, it is very far (excepting in Philadelphia) from beingin good taste.  They do not consult the seasons in the colours orin the style of their costume; I have often shivered at seeing ayoung beauty picking her way through the snow with a palerose-coloured bonnet, set on the very top of her head: I knew oneyoung lady whose pretty little ear was actually frostbitten frombeing thus exposed.  They never wear muffs or boots, and appearextremely shocked at the sight of comfortable walking shoes andcotton stockings, even when they have to step to their sleighsover ice and snow.  They walk in the middle of winter with theirpoor little toes pinched into a miniature slipper, incapable ofexcluding as much moisture as might bedew a primrose.  I must sayin their excuse, however, that they have, almost universally,extremely pretty feet.  They do not walk well, nor, in fact, dothey ever appear to advantage when in movement.  I know not whythis should be, for they have abundance of French dancing-mastersamong them, but somehow or other it is the fact.  I fancied Icould often trace a mixture of affectation and of shyness intheir little mincing unsteady step, and the ever changingposition of the hands.  They do not dance well; perhaps I shouldrather say they do not look well when dancing; lovely as theirfaces are, they cannot, in a position that exhibits the wholeperson, atone for the want of _tournure_, and for the universaldefect in the formation of the bust, which is rarely full, orgracefully formed.I never saw an American man walk or stand well; notwithstandingtheir frequent militia drillings, they are nearly all hollowchested and round shouldered: perhaps this is occasioned by noofficer daring to say to a brother free-born "hold up your head;"whatever the cause, the effect is very remarkable to a stranger.In stature, and in physiognomy, a great majority of thepopulation, both male and female, are strikingly handsome, butthey know not how to do their own honours; half as muchcomeliness elsewhere would produce ten times as much effect.Nothing can exceed their activity and perseverance in all kindsof speculation, handicraft, and enterprise, which promises aprofitable pecuniary result.  I heard an Englishman, who had beenlong resident in America, declare that in following, in meeting,or in overtaking, in the street, on the road, or in the field, atthe theatre, the coffee-house, or at home, he had never overheardAmericans conversing without the word DOLLAR being pronouncedbetween them.  Such unity of purpose, such sympathy of feeling,can, I believe, be found nowhere else, except, perhaps, in anants' nest.  The result is exactly what might be anticipated.This sordid object, for ever before their eyes, must inevitablyproduce a sordid tone of mind, and, worse still, it produces aseared and blunted conscience on all questions of probity.  Iknow not a more striking evidence of the low tone of moralitywhich is generated by this universal pursuit of money, than themanner in which the New England States are described byAmericans.  All agree in saying that they present a spectacle ofindustry and prosperity delightful to behold, and this is thedistrict and the population most constantly quoted as the finestspecimen of their admirable country; yet I never met a singleindividual in any part of the Union who did not paint these NewEnglanders as sly, grinding, selfish, and tricking.  The yankees(as the New Englanders are called) will avow these qualitiesthemselves with a complacent smile, and boast that no people onthe earth can match them at over reaching in a bargain.  I haveheard them unblushingly relate stories of their cronies andfriends, which, if believed among us, would banish the heroesfrom the fellowship of honest men for ever; and all this isuttered with a simplicity which sometimes led me to doubt if thespeakers knew what honour and honesty meant.  Yet the Americansdeclare that "they are the most moral people upon earth."  Againand again I have heard this asserted, not only in conversation,and by their writings, but even from the pulpit.  Such broadassumption of superior virtue demands examination, and after fouryears of attentive and earnest observation and enquiry, my honestconviction is, that the standard of moral character in the UnitedStates is very greatly lower than in Europe.  Of their religion,as it appears outwardly, I have had occasion to speak frequently;I pretend not to judge the heart, but, without any uncharitablepresumption, I must take permission to say, that both ProtestantEngland and Catholic France show an infinitely superior religiousand moral aspect to mortal observation, both as to reverenddecency of external observance, and as to the inward fruit ofhonest dealing between man and man.In other respects I think no one will be disappointed who visitsthe country, expecting to find no more than common sense mightteach him to look for, namely, a vast continent, by far thegreater part of which is still in the state in which nature leftit, and a busy, bustling, industrious population, hacking andhewing their way through it.  What greatly increases the interestof this spectacle, is the wonderful facility for internalcommerce, furnished by the rivers, lakes, and canals, whichthread the country in every direction, producing a rapidity ofprogress in all commercial and agricultural speculationaltogether unequalled.  This remarkable feature is perceptible inevery part of the union into which the fast spreading populationhas hitherto found its way, and forms, I think, the mostremarkable and interesting peculiarity of the country.  I hardlyremember a single town where vessels of some description or othermay not constantly be seen in full activity.Their carriages of every kind are very unlike ours; thosebelonging to private individuals seem all constructed with a viewto summer use, for which they are extremely well calculated, butthey are by no means comfortable in winter.  The waggons and carsare built with great strength, which is indeed necessary, fromthe roads they often have to encounter.  The stagecoaches areheavier and much less comfortable than those of France; to thoseof England they can bear no comparison.  I never saw any harnessthat I could call handsome, nor any equipage which, as to horses,carriage, harness, and servants, could be considered as complete.The sleighs are delightful, and constructed at so little expensethat I wonder we have not all got them in England, lying by, inwaiting for the snow, which often remains with us long enough topermit their use.  Sleighing is much more generally enjoyed bynight than by day, for what reason I could never discover, unlessit be, that no gentlemen are to be found disengaged from businessin the mornings.  Nothing, certainly, can be more agreeable thanthe gliding smoothly and rapidly along, deep sunk in soft furs,the moon shining with almost midday splendour, the air of crystalbrightness, and the snow sparkling on every side, as if it weresprinkled with diamonds.  And then the noiseless movement of thehorses, so mysterious and unwonted, and the gentle tinkling ofthe bells you meet and carry, all help at once to soothe andexcite the spirits: in short, I had not the least objection tosleighing by night, I only wished to sleigh by day also.Almost every resident in the country has a carriage they call acarryall, which name I suspect to be a corruption of the carioleso often mentioned in the pretty Canadian story of Emily Montagu.It is clumsy enough, certainly, but extremely convenient, andadmirably calculated, with its thick roof and moveable draperies,for every kind of summer excursion.Their steam-boats, were the social arrangements somewhatimproved, would be delightful, as a mode of travelling; but theyare very seldom employed for excursions of mere amusement: nor doI remember seeing pleasure-boats, properly so called, at any ofthe numerous places where they might be used with so much safetyand enjoyment.How often did our homely adage recur to me, "All work and no playwould make Jack a dull boy;" Jonathan is a very dull boy.  We areby no means so gay as our lively neighbours on the other side theChannel, but, compared with Americans, we are whirligigs andtetotums; every day is a holyday, and every night a festival.Perhaps if the ladies had quite their own way, a little morerelaxation would be permitted; but there is one remarkablepeculiarity in their manners which precludes the possibility ofany dangerous outbreaking of the kind: few ladies have anycommand of ready money entrusted to them.  I have been a hundredtimes present when bills for a few dollars, perhaps for one, havebeen brought for payment to ladies living in perfectly easycircumstances, who have declared themselves without money, andreferred the claimant to their husbands for payment.  On everyoccasion where immediate disbursement is required it is the same;even in shopping for ready cash they say, "send a bill home withthe things, and my husband will give you a draft."I think that it was during my stay at Washington, that I wasinformed of a government regulation, which appeared to mecurious; I therefore record it here.Every Deputy Post-Master is required to insert in his return thetitle of every newspaper received at his office for distribution.This return is laid before the Secretary of State, who,perfectly knowing the political character of each newspaper, isthus enabled to feel the pulse of every limb of the monster mob.This is a well imagined device for getting a peep at the politicsof a country where newspapers make part of the daily food, but isit quite consistent with their entire freedom?  I do not believewe have any such tricks to regulate the disposal of offices andappointments.I believe it was in Indiana that Mr. T. met with a printednotice relative to the payment of taxes, which I preserved as acurious sample of the manner in which the free citizens arecoaxed and reasoned into obeying the laws.                    "LOOK OUT DELINQUENTS""Those indebted to me for taxes, fees, notes, and accounts, arespecially requested to call and pay the same on or before the 1stday of December, 1828, as no longer indulgence will be given.  Ihave called time and again, by advertisement and otherwise, tolittle effect; but now the time has come when my situationrequires immediate payment from all indebted to me.  It isimpossible for me to pay off the amount of the duplicates oftaxes and my other debts without recovering the same of thosefrom whom it is due.  I am at a loss to know the reason why thosecharged with taxes neglect to pay; from the negligence of many itwould seem that they think the money is mine, or I have funds todischarge the taxes due to the State, and that I can wait withthem until it suits their convenience to pay.  The money is notmine; neither have I the funds to settle amount of the duplicate.My only resort is to collect; in doing so I should be sorry tohave to resort to the authority given me by law for the recoveryof the same.  It should be the first object of every good citizento pay his taxes, for it is in that way government is supported.Why are taxes assessed unless they are collected?  Depend uponit, I shall proceed to collect agreeably to law, so governyourselves accordingly.     JOHN SPENCER,     Sh'ff and Collector, D.C.     Nov 20, 1828.""N.B.  On Thursday, the 27th inst.  A.

H.Dunn, Esqrs. depart for Indianopolis; I wish as many as can payto do so, to enable me to forward as much as possible, to savethe twenty-one per cent, that will be charged against me afterthe 8th of December next.     JS."The first autumn I passed in America, I was surprised to find agreat and very oppressive return of heat, accompanied with aheavy mistiness in the air, long after the summer heats wereover; when this state of the atmosphere comes on, they say, "wehave got to the Indian summer."  On desiring to have this phraseexplained, I was told that the phenomenon described as the_Indian Summer_ was occasioned by the Indians setting fire to thewoods, which spread heat and smoke to a great distance; but Iafterwards met with the following explanation, which appears tome much more reasonable.  "The Indian summer is so calledbecause, at the particular period of the year in which itobtains, the Indians break up their village communities, and goto the interior to prepare for their winter hunting.  Thisseason seems to mark a dividing line, between the heat of summer,and the cold of winter, and is, from its mildness, suited tothese migrations.  The cause of this heat is the slow combustionof the leaves and other vegetable matter of the boundless andinterminable forests.  Those who at this season of the year havepenetrated these forests, know all about it.  To the feet theheat is quite sensible, whilst the ascending vapour warms everything it embraces, and spreading out into the wide atmosphere,fills the circuit of the heavens with its peculiar heat andsmokiness."This unnatural heat sufficiently accounts for the sickliness ofthe American autumn.  The effect of it is extremely distressingto the nerves, even when the general health continues good; tome, it was infinitely more disagreeable than the glowing heat ofthe dog-days.A short time before we arrived in America, the Duke ofSaxe-Weimar made a tour of the United States.  I heard manypersons speak of his unaffected and amiable manners, yet he couldnot escape the dislike which every trace of gentlemanly feelingis sure to create among the ordinary class of Americans.  As anamusing instance of this, I made the following extract from anewspaper."A correspondent of the Charlestown Gazette tells an anecdoteconnected with the Duke of Saxe-Weimar's recent journey throughour country, which we do not recollect to have heard before,although some such story is told of the veritable Capt. BasilHall.  The scene occurred on the route between Augusta andMilledgeville; it seems that the sagacious Duke engaged three orfour, or more seats, in the regular stage, for the accommodationof himself and suite, and thought by this that he had secured themonopoly of the vehicle.  Not so, however; a traveller camealong, and entered his name upon the book, and secured his seatby payment of the customary charges.  To the Duke's greatsurprise on entering the stage, he found our travellercomfortably housed in one of the most eligible seats, wrapt up inhis fear-nought, and snoring like a buffalo.  The Duke, greatlyirritated, called for the question of consideration.  Hedemanded, in broken English, the cause of the gross intrusion,and insisted in a very princely manner, though not, it seems invery princely language, upon the incumbent vacating the seat inwhich he had made himself so impudently at home.  But the Dukehad yet to learn his first lesson of republicanism.  The driverwas one of those sturdy southrons, who can always, and at amoment's warning, whip his weight in wild cats: and he asresolutely told the Duke, that the traveller was as good, if nota better man, than himself; and that no alteration of theexisting arrangement could be permitted.  Saxe-Weimar becameviolent at this opposition, so unlike any to which his educationhitherto had ever subjected him, and threatened John with theapplication of the bamboo.  This was one of those threats whichin Georgia dialect would subject a man to "a rowing up saltriver;" and, accordingly, down leaped our driver from his box,and peeling himself for the combat, he leaped about the vehiclein the most wild-boar style, calling upon the prince of a fiveacre patch to put his threat in execution.  But he of the starrefused to make up issue in the way suggested, contenting himselfwith assuring the enraged southron of a complaint to hisexcellency the Governor, on arriving at the seat of government.This threat was almost as unlucky as the former, for it wroughtthe individual for whom it was intended into that species offury, which, through discriminating in its madness, isnevertheless without much limit in its violence, and he sworethat the Governor might go to --, and for his part he would justas leave lick the Governor as the Duke; he'd like no better funthan to give both Duke and Governor a dressing in the samebreath; could do it, he had little doubt, &c. &c.; andinstigating one fist to diverge into the face of the marvellingand panic-stricken nobleman, with the other he thrust him downinto a seat alongside the traveller, whose presence had beenoriginally of such sore discomfort to his excellency, and biddingthe attendants jump in with their discomfited master, he mountedhis box in triumph, and went on his journey."  I fully believethat this brutal history would be as distasteful to the travelledand polished few who are to be found scattered through the Union,as it is to me: but if they do not deem the _possibility_ of sucha scene to be a national degradation, I differ from them.  TheAmerican people (speaking of the great mass) have no more idea ofwhat constitutes the difference between this "Prince of a fiveacre patch," and themselves, than a dray-horse has of estimatingthe points of the elegant victor of the race-course.  Could thedray-horse speak, when expected to yield the daintiest stall tohis graceful rival, he would say, "a horse is a horse;" and is itnot with the same logic that the transatlantic Houynnhnm putsdown all superiority with "a man is a man?"This story justifies the reply of Talleyrand, when asked byNapoleon what he thought of the Americans, "Sire, ce sont desfiers cochons, et des cochons fiers."CHAPTER 29Literature--Extracts--Fine Arts--EducationThe character of the American literature is, generally speaking,pretty justly appreciated in Europe.  The immense exhalation ofperiodical trash, which penetrates into every cot and corner ofthe country, and which is greedily sucked in by all ranks, isunquestionably one great cause of its inferiority.  Wherenewspapers are the principal vehicles of the wit and wisdom of apeople, the higher graces of composition can hardly be lookedfor.That there are many among them who can write well, is mostcertain; but it is at least equally so, that they have littleencouragement to exercise the power in any manner more dignifiedthan becoming the editor of a newspaper or a magazine.  As far asI could judge, their best writers are far from being the mostpopular.  The general taste is decidedly bad; this is obvious,not only from the mass of slip-slop poured forth by the daily andweekly press, but from the inflated tone of eulogy in which theirinsect authors are lauded.To an American writer, I should think it must be a flatteringdistinction to escape the admiration of the newspapers.  Fewpersons of taste, I imagine, would like such notice as thefollowing, which I copied from a New York paper, where itfollowed the advertisement of a partnership volume of poems by aMr, and Mrs. Brooks; but of such, are their literary noticeschiefly composed."The lovers of impassioned and classical numbers may promisethemselves much gratification from the muse of Brooks, while themany-stringed harp of his lady, the Norna of the Courier Harp,which none but she can touch, has a chord for every heart."Another obvious cause of inferiority in the national literature,is the very slight acquaintance with the best models ofcomposition, which is thought necessary for persons called welleducated.  There may be reason for deprecating the lavish expenseof time bestowed in England on the acquirement of Latin andGreek, and it may be doubtful whether the power of composing inthese languages with correctness and facility, be worth all thelabour it costs; but as long as letters shall be left on theearth, the utility of a perfect familiarity with the exquisitemodels of antiquity, cannot be doubted.  I think I run no risk ofcontradiction, when I say that an extremely small proportion ofthe higher classes in America possess this familiar acquaintancewith the classics.  It is vain to suppose that translations maysuffice.  Noble as are the thoughts the ancients have left us,their power of expression is infinitely more important as a studyto modern writers; and this no translation can furnish.  Nor didit appear to me that their intimacy with modern literature wassuch as to assist them much in the formation of style.  What theyclass as modern literature seems to include little beyond theEnglish publications of the day.To speak of Chaucer, or even Spenser, as a modern, appears tothem inexpressibly ridiculous; and all the rich and variedeloquence of Italy, from Dante to Monti, is about as much knownto them, as the Welsh effusions of Urien and Modred, to us.Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot, &c., were read by the oldfederalists, but now they seem known more as naughty words, thanas great names.  I am much mistaken if a hundred untravelledAmericans could be found, who have read Boileau or Le Fontaine.Still fewer are acquainted with that delightful host of Frenchfemale writers, whose memoirs and letters sparkle in every pagewith unequalled felicity of style.  The literature of Spain andPortugal is no better known, and as for "the wits of Queen Anne'sday," they are laid _en masse_ upon a shelf, in some score ofvery old-fashioned houses, together with Sherlock and Taylor, asmuch too antiquated to suit the immensely rapid progress of mindwhich distinguishes America.The most perfect examples of English writing, either of our own,or of any former day, have assuredly not been produced by theimitation of any particular style; but the Fairy Queen wouldhardly have been written, if the Orlando had not; nor wouldMilton have been the perfect poet he was, had Virgil and Tassobeen unknown to him.  It is not that the scholar mimics inwriting the phrases he has read, but that he can neither think,feel, nor express himself as he might have done, had his mentalcompanionship been of a lower order.They are great novel readers, but the market is chiefly furnishedby England.  They have, however, a few very good native novels.Mr. Flint's Francis Berrian is delightful.  There is a vigor andfreshness in his writing that is exactly in accordance with whatone looks for, in the literature of a new country; and yet,strange to say, it is exactly what is most wanting in that ofAmerica.  It appeared to me that the style of their imaginativecompositions was almost always affected, and inflated.  Even intreating their great national subject of romance, the Indians,they are seldom either powerful or original.  A few well knowngeneral features, moral and physical, are presented over and overagain in all their Indian stories, till in reading them you loseall sense of individual character.  Mr. Flint's History of theMississippi Valley is a work of great interest, and information,and will, I hope, in time find its way to England, where I thinkit is much more likely to be appreciated than in America.Dr. Channing is a writer too well known in England to require mytestimony to his great ability.  As a preacher he has, perhaps,hardly a rival any where.  This gentleman is an Unitarian, and Iwas informed by several persons well acquainted with the literarycharacter of the country, that nearly all their distinguished menwere of this persuasion.Mr. Pierpoint is a very eloquent preacher, and a sweet poet.  Hisworks are not so well known among us as .they ought to be.  Mr.Everett has written some beautiful lines, and if I may judge fromthe specimens of his speeches, as preserved in the volumesintitled "Eloquence of the United States," I should say that heshone more as a poet than an orator.  But American fame hasdecided otherwise.Mr. M. Flint, of Louisiana, has published a volume of poems whichought to be naturalised here.  Mr. Hallock, of New York, has muchfacility of versification, and is greatly in fashion as adrawing-room poet, but I think he has somewhat too much respectfor himself, and too little for his readers.It is, I think, Mr. Bryant who ranks highest as the poet of theUnion.  This is too lofty an eminence for me to attack; besides,"I am of another parish," and therefore, perhaps, no very fairjudge.From miscellaneous poetry I made a great many extracts, but uponreturning to them for transcription I thought that ill-nature anddulness, ('oh ill-matched pair!') would be more served by theirinsertion, than wholesome criticism.The massive Fredoniad of Dr. Emmons, in forty cantos, I neverread; but as I did not meet a single native who had, I hope thiswant of poetical enterprise will be excused.They have very few native tragedies; not more than half a dozen Ibelieve, and those of very recent date.  It would be ungenerousto fall heavily upon these; the attempt alone, nearly the mostarduous a poet can make, is of itself honourable: and the successat least equal to that in any other department of literature.Mr. Paulding is a popular writer of novels; some of hisproductions have been recently republished in England.  MissSedgwick is also well known among us; her "Hope Leslie" is abeautiful story.  Mr. Washington Irving and Mr. Cooper have sodecidedly chosen another field, whereon to reap their laurels,that it is hardly necessary to name them here.I am not, of course, competent to form any opinion of theirscientific works; but some papers which I read almostaccidentally, appeared to me to be written with great clearness,and neatness of definition.It appears extraordinary that a people who loudly declare theirrespect for science, should be entirely without observatories.Neither at their seats of learning, nor in their cities, does anything of the kind exist; nor did I in any direction hear ofindividuals, given to the study of astronomy.I had not the pleasure of making any acquaintance with Mr.Bowditch, of Boston, but I know that this gentleman ranks veryhigh as a mathematician in the estimation of the scientific worldof Europe.Jefferson's posthumous works were very generally circulatedwhilst I was in America.  They are a mighty mass of mischief.  Hewrote with more perspicuity than he thought, and his hot-headeddemocracy has done a fearful injury to his country.  Hollow andunsound as his doctrines are, they are but too palatable to apeople, each individual of whom would rather derive hisimportance from believing that none are above him, than from theconsciousness that in his station he makes part of a noble whole.The social system of Mr. Jefferson, if carried into effect,would make of mankind an unamalgamated mass of grating atoms,where the darling "I'm as good as you," would soon take place ofthe law and the Gospel.  As it is, his principles, though happilynot fully put in action, have yet produced most lamentableresults.  The assumption of equality, however empty, issufficient to tincture the manners of the poor with brutalinsolence, and subjects the rich to the paltry expediency ofsanctioning the falsehood, however deep their conviction that itis such.  It cannot, I think, be denied that the great men ofAmerica attain to power and to fame, by eternally uttering whatthey know to be untrue.  American citizens are not equal.  DidWashington feel them to be so, when his word outweighed (sohappily for them) the votes of thousands?  Did Franklin thinkthat all were equal when he shouldered his way from the printingpress to the cabinet?  True, he looked back in high good humour,and with his kindest smile told the poor devils whom he leftbehind, that they were all his equals; but Franklin did not speakthe truth, and he knew it.  The great, the immortal Jeffersonhimself, he who when past the three score years and ten, stilltaught young females to obey his nod, and so became the father ofunnumbered generations of groaning slaves, what was his matin andhis vesper hymn?  "All men are born free and equal."  Did thevenerable father of the gang believe it?  Or did he too purchasehis immortality by a lie?From the five heavy volumes of the "Eloquence of the UnitedStates," I made a few extracts, which I give more for the sake oftheir political interest, than for any purpose of literarycriticism.Mr. Hancock (one of those venerated men who signed the act ofindependence), in speaking of England, thus expresses himself:"But if I was possessed of the gift of prophecy, I dare not(except by Divine command) unfold the leaves on which the destinyof that once powerful kingdom is inscribed."  It is impossiblenot to regret that Mr. Hancock should thus have let "I dare not,wait upon I would."  It would have been exceedingly edifying tohave known beforehand all the terrible things the republic wasabout to do for us.This prophetic orator spoke the modest, yet awful words, abovequoted, nearly sixty years ago; in these latter days men arebecome bolder, for in a modern 4th of July oration, Mr. Rush,without waiting, I think, for Divine command, gives the followingamiable portrait of the British character."In looking at Britain, we see a harshness of individual characterin the general view of it, which is perceived and acknowledged byall Europe; a spirit of unbecoming censure as regards all customsand institutions not their own; a ferocity in some of theircharacteristics of national manners, pervading their verypastimes, which no other modern people are endued with theblunted sensibility to bear; an universal self-assumedsuperiority, not innocently manifesting itself in speculativesentiments among themselves, but unamiably indulged when withforeigners, of whatever description, in their own country, orwhen they themselves are the temporary sojourners in a foreigncountry; a code of criminal law that forgets to feel for humanfrailty, that sports with human misfortune, that has shed moreblood in deliberate judicial severity for two centuries past,constantly increasing, too, in its sanguinary hue, than has everbeen sanctioned by the jurisprudence of any ancient or modernnation, civilized and refined like herself; the mercilesswhippings in her army, peculiar to herself alone, the conspicuouscommission and freest acknowledgment of vice in the upperclasses; the overweening distinctions shown to opulence andbirth, so destructive of a sound moral sentiment in the nation,so baffling to virtue.  These are some of the traits that rise upto a contemplation of the inhabitants of this isle."Where is the alchymy that can extract from Captain Hall's workone thousandth part of the ill-will contained in this onepassage? Yet America has resounded from shore to shore withexecrations against his barbarous calumnies.But now we will listen to another tone.  Let us see how Americanscan praise.  Mr. Everett, in a recent 4th of July oration, speaksthus:--"We are authorised to assert, that the era of our independencedates the establishment of the only perfect organization ofgovernment."  Again, "Our government is in its theory perfect,and in its operation it is perfect also.  Thus we have solvedthe great problem in human affairs."  And again, "A frame ofgovernment perfect in its principles has been brought down fromthe airy regions of Utopia, and has found a local habitation anda name in our country."Among my miscellaneous reading, I got hold of an Americanpublication giving a detailed, and, indeed, an official accountof the capture of Washington by the British, in 1814.  An eventso long past, and of so little ultimate importance, is, perhaps,hardly worth alluding to; but there are some passages in theofficial documents which I thought very amusing.At the very moment of receiving the attack of the British on theheights of Bladensburgh, there seems to have been a most curiouspuzzle among the American generals, as to where they were to bestationed, and what they were to do.  It is stated that theBritish threw themselves forward in open order, advancing singly.The American general (Winden) goes on in his narrative todescribe what followed, thus:"Our advanced riflemen now began to fire, and continued it forhalf a dozen rounds, when I observed them to run back to anorchard.  They halted there, and seemed for a moment aboutreturning to their original position, but in a few momentsentirely broke and retired to the left of Stansburg's line.  Theadvanced artillery immediately followed the riflemen."The first three or four rockets fired by the enemy were muchabove the heads of Stansburg's line; but the rockets having takena more horizontal direction, an universal flight of the centreand left of this brigade was the consequence.  The 5th regimentand the artillery still remained, and I hoped would prevent theenemy's approach, but they advancing singly, their fire annoyedthe 5th considerably, when I ordered it to retire, to put it outof the reach of the enemy.  This order was, however, immediatelycountermanded, from an aversion to retire before the necessitybecame stronger, and from a hope that the enemy would issue in abody, and enable us to act upon him on terms of equality.  Butthe enemy's fire beginning to annoy the 5th still more, bywounding several of them, and a strong column passing up theroad, and deploying on its left, I ordered them to retire; theirretreat became a flight of absolute and total disorder."Of Beall's regiment, the general gives the following succinctaccount--"It gave one or two ineffectual fires and fled."In another place he says, piteously,--"The cavalry would do anything but charge."General Armstrong's gentle and metaphysical account of thebusiness was, that--"Without all doubt the determining cause ofour disasters is to be found in the love of life."This affair at Washington, which in its result was certainlyadvantageous to America, inasmuch as it caused the presentbeautiful capitol to be built in the place of the one we burnt,was, nevertheless, considered as a national calamity at the time.In a volume of miscellaneous poems I met with one, written withthe patriotic purpose of cheering the country under it; onetriplet struck me as rather alarming for us, however soothing toAmerica.          "Supposing George's house at Kew           Were burnt, as we intend to do,           Would that be burning England too?"I think I have before mentioned that no work of mere pleasantryhas hitherto been found to answer; but a recent attempt of thekind as been made, with what success cannot as yet be decided.The editors are comedians belonging to the Boston company, and itis entitled "The American Comic Annual."  It is accompanied byetchings, somewhat in the manner, but by no means with the spiritof Cruikshank's.  Among the pleasantries of this lively volumeare some biting attacks upon us, particularly upon our utterincapacity of speaking English.  We really must engage a fewAmerican professors, or we shall lose all trace of classic purityin our language.  As a specimen, and rather a favourable one, ofthe work, I transcribed an extract from a little piece, entitled,"Sayings and Doings, a Fragment of a Farce."  One of thepersonages of this farce is an English gentleman, a CaptainMandaville, and among many speeches of the same kind, I selectedthe following.  Collins's Ode is the subject of conversation."A--r, A--a--a it stroiks me that that you manetion his the hodeabout hangger and ope and orror and revenge you know.  I've eardMrs. Sitdowns hencored in it at Common Garden and Doory Lane inthe ight of her poplarity you know.  By the boye, hall the hactinin Amareka is werry orrid.  You're honely in the hinfancy of theistoryonic hart you know; your performers never haspirate thehaitch in sich vords for instance as hink and hoats, and leaveout the _w_ in wice wanity you know; and make nothink of homittinthe _k_ in somethink."There is much more in the same style, but, perhaps, this maysuffice.  I have given this passage chiefly because it affords anexample of the manner in which the generality of Americans areaccustomed to speak of English pronunciation and phraseology.It must be remembered, however, here and every where, that thisphrase, "the Americans," does not include the instructed andtravelled portion of the community.It would be absurd to swell my little volumes with extracts inproof of the veracity of their contents, but having spoken of thetaste of their lighter works, and also of the general tone ofmanners, I cannot forbear inserting a page from an Americanannual (The Token), which purports to give a scene fromfashionable life.  It is part of a dialogue between a young ladyof the "highest standing" and her "tutor," who is moreover herlover, though not yet acknowledged."And so you wo'nt tell me," said she, "what has come over you,and why you look as grave and sensible as a Dictionary, when, bygeneral consent, even mine, 'motley's the only wear?'"'"Am I so grave, Miss Blair?"'"Are you so grave, Miss Blair?  One would think I had not gotmy lesson today.  Pray, sir, has the black ox trod upon your toesince we parted?"'Philip tried to laugh, but he did not succeed; he bit his lipand was silent.'"I am under orders to entertain you, Mr. Blondel, and if my poorbrain can be made to gird this fairy isle, I shall certainly beobedient.  So I begin with playing the leech.  What ails you,sir?"'"Miss Blair!" he was going to remonstrate.'"Miss Blair!  Now, pity.  I'm a quack! for whip me, if I knowwhether Miss Blair is a fever or an ague.  How did you catch it,sir?"'"Really, Miss Blair--"'"Nay, I see you don't like doctoring; I give over, and now I'llbe sensible.  It's a fine day, Mr. Blondel."'"Very."'"A pleasant lane, this, to walk in, if one's company wereagreeable."'"Does Mr. Skefton stay long?" asked Philip, abruptly.'"No one knows,"'"Indeed! are you so ignorant?"'"And why does your wisdom ask that question?"'In no society in the world can the advantage of travel be soconspicuous as in America, in other countries a tone ofunpretending simplicity can more than compensate for the absenceof enlarged views or accurate observation; but this tone is notto be found in America, or if it be, it is only among those who,having looked at that insignificant portion of the world notincluded in the Union, have learnt to know how much is stillunknown within the mighty part which is.  For the rest, they alldeclare, and do in truth believe, that they only, among the sonsof men, have wit and wisdom, and that one of their exclusiveprivileges is that of speaking English _elegantly_.  There aretwo reasons for this latter persuasion; the one is, that thegreat majority have never heard any English but their own, exceptfrom the very lowest of the Irish; and the other, that those whohave chanced to find themselves in the society of the feweducated English who have visited America, have discovered thatthere is a marked difference between their phrases and accentsand those to which they have been accustomed, whereupon theyhave, of course, decided that no Englishman can speak English.The reviews of America contain some good clear-headed articles;but I sought in vain for the playful vivacity and thekeenly-cutting satire, whose sharp edge, however painful to thepatient, is of such high utility in lopping off the excrescencesof bad taste, and levelling to its native clay the heavy growthof dulness.  Still less could I find any trace of that gracefulfamiliarity of learned allusion and general knowledge which markthe best European reviews, and which make one feel in suchperfectly good company while perusing them.  But this is a tonenot to be found either in the writings or conversation ofAmericans; as distant from pedantry as from ignorance, it is notlearning itself, but the effect of it; and so pervading andsubtle is its influence that it may be traced in the festivehalls and gay drawing-rooms of Europe as certainly as in thecloistered library or student's closet; it is, perhaps, the lastfinish of highly-finished society.A late American Quarterly has an article on a work of Dr. VonSchmidt Phiseldek, from which I made an extract, as a curioussample of the dreams they love to batten on.Dr. Von Phiseldek (not Fiddlestick), who is not only a doctor ofphilosophy, but a knight of Dannebrog to boot, has never been inAmerica, but he has written a prophecy, showing that the UnitedStates must and will govern the whole world, because they are sovery big, and have so much uncultivated territory; he prophesiesthat an union will take place between North and South America,which will give a death-blow to Europe, at no distant period;though he modestly adds that he does not pretend to designate theprecise period at which this will take place.  This Danishprophecy, as may be imagined, enchants the reviewer.  He exhortsall people to read Dr. Phiseldek's book, because "nothing butgood can come of such contemplations of the future, and becauseit is eminently calculated to awaken the most lofty anticipationsof the destiny which awaits them, and will serve to impress uponthe nation the necessity of being prepared for such highdestiny."  In another place the reviewer bursts out, "America,young as she is, has become already the beacon, the patriarch ofthe struggling nations of the world;" and afterwards adds, Itwould be departing from the natural order of things, and theordinary operations of the great scheme of Providence, it wouldbe shutting our ears to the voice of experience, and our eyes tothe inevitable connexion of causes and their effects, were we toreject the extreme probability, not to say _moral certainty_,that the old world is destined to receive its influences infuture from the new."  There are twenty pages of this article,but I will only give one passage more; it is an instance of thesort of reasoning by which American citizens persuade themselvesthat the glory of Europe is, in reality, her reproach.  "Wrappedup in a sense of his superiority, the European reclines at home,shining in his borrowed plumes, derived from the product of everycorner of the earth, and the industry of every portion of itsinhabitants, with which his own natural resources would neverhave invested him, he continues revelling in enjoyments whichnature has denied him."The American Quarterly deservedly holds the highest place intheir periodical literature, and, therefore, may be fairly quotedas striking the keynote for the chorus of public opinion.  Surelyit is nationality rather than patriotism which leads it thus tospeak in scorn of the successful efforts of enlightened nationsto win from every corner of the earth the riches which nature hasscattered over it.The incorrectness of the press is very great; they make strangework in the reprints of French and Italian; and the Latin, Isuspect, does not fare much better: I believe they do not oftenmeddle with Greek.With regard to the fine arts, their paintings, I think, are quiteas good, or rather better, than might be expected from thepatronage they receive; the wonder is that any man can be foundwith courage enough to devote himself to a profession in which hehas so little chance of finding a maintenance.  The trade of acarpenter opens an infinitely better prospect; and this is sowell known, that nothing but a genuine passion for the art couldbeguile any one to pursue it.  The entire absence of every meansof improvement, and effectual study, is unquestionably the causewhy those who manifest this devotion cannot advance farther.  Iheard of one young artist, whose circumstances did not permit hisgoing to Europe, but who being nevertheless determined that hisstudies should, as nearly as possible, resemble those of theEuropean academies, was about to commence drawing the humanfigure, for which purpose he had provided himself with a thinsilk dress, in which to clothe his models, as no one of anystation, he said, could be found who would submit to sit as amodel without clothing.It was at Alexandria that I saw what I consider as the bestpicture by an American artist that I met with.  The subject wasHagar and Ishmael.  It had recently arrived from Rome, where thepainter, a young man of the name of Chapman, had been studyingfor three years.  His mother told me that he was twenty-two yearsof age, and passionately devoted to the art; should he, onreturning to his country, receive sufficient encouragement tokeep his ardour and his industry alive, I think I shall hear ofhim again.Much is said about the universal diffusion of education inAmerica, and a vast deal of genuine admiration is felt andexpressed at the progress of mind throughout the Union.  Theybelieve themselves in all sincerity to have surpassed, to besurpassing, and to be about to surpass, the whole earth in theintellectual race.  I am aware that not a single word can besaid, hinting a different opinion, which will not bring down atransatlantic anathema on my head; yet the subject is toointeresting to be omitted.  Before I left England I rememberlistening, with much admiration, to an eloquent friend, whodeprecated our system of public education, as confining thevarious and excursive faculties of our children to one beatenpath, paying little or no attention to the peculiar powers ofthe individual.This objection is extremely plausible, but doubts of itsintrinsic value must, I think, occur to every one who has markedthe result of a different system throughout the United States.From every enquiry I could make, and I took much pains to obtainaccurate information, it appeared that much is attempted, butvery little beyond reading, writing, and bookkeeping, isthoroughly acquired.  Were we to read a prospectus of the systempursued in any of our public schools and that of a first-rateseminary in America, we should be struck by the confinedscholastic routine of the former, when compared to the varied andexpansive scope of the latter; but let the examination go alittle farther, and I believe it will be found that the oldfashioned school discipline of England has produced somethinghigher, and deeper too, than that which roars so loud, andthunders in the index.They will not afford to let their young men study till two orthree and twenty, and it is therefore declared, _ex cathedraAmericana_, to be unnecessary.  At sixteen, often much earlier,education ends, and money-making begins; the idea that morelearning is necessary than can be acquired by that time, isgenerally ridiculed as obsolete monkish bigotry; added to which,if the seniors willed a more prolonged discipline, the juniorswould refuse submission.  When the money-getting begins, leisureceases, and all of lore which can be acquired afterwards, ispicked up from novels, magazines, and newspapers.At what time can the taste be formed?  How can a correct andpolished style, even of speaking, be acquired? or when can thefruit of the two thousand years of past thinking be added to thenative growth of American intellect?  These are the tools, if Imay so express myself, which our elaborate system of schooldiscipline puts into the hands of our scholars; possessed ofthese, they may use them in whatever direction they pleaseafterwards, they can never be an incumbrance.No people appear more anxious to excite admiration and receiveapplause than the Americans, yet none take so little trouble,or make so few sacrifices to obtain it.  This may answer amongthemselves, but it will not with the rest of the world;individual sacrifices must be made, and national economyenlarged, before America can compete with the old world intaste, learning, and liberality.The reception of General Lafayette is the one single instancein which the national pride has overcome the national thrift;and this was clearly referrible to the one single feeling ofenthusiasm of which they appear capable, namely, the triumphof their successful struggle for national independence.  Butthough this feeling will be universally acknowledged as a worthyand lawful source of triumph and of pride, it will not serve totrade upon for ever, as a fund of glory and high station amongthe nations.  Their fathers were colonists; they fought stoutly,and became an independent people.  Success and admiration, eventhe admiration of those whose yoke they had broken, cheeredthem while living, still sheds a glory round their remote anduntitled sepulchres, and will illumine the page of their historyfor ever.Their children inherit the independence; they inherit too thehonour of being the sons of brave fathers; but this will not givethem the reputation at which they aim, of being scholars andgentlemen, nor will it enable them to sit down for evermore totalk of their glory, while they drink mint julap and chewtobacco, swearing by the beard of Jupiter (or some other oath)that they are very graceful, and agreeable, and, moreover abusingevery body who does not cry out Amen!To doubt that talent and mental power of every kind exist inAmerica would be absurd; why should it not?  But in taste andlearning they are woefully deficient; and it is this whichrenders them incapable of graduating a scale by which to measurethemselves.  Hence arises that over weening complacency andself-esteem, both national and individual, which at once rendersthem so extremely obnoxious to ridicule, and so peculiarlyrestive under it.If they will scorn the process by which other nations have becomewhat they avowedly intend to be, they must rest satisfied withthe praise and admiration they receive from each other; andturning a deaf ear to the criticism of the old world, consent tobe their own prodigious great reward."Alexandria has its churches, chapels, and conventicles asabundantly, in proportion to its size, as any city in the Union.I visited most of them, and in the Episcopal and Catholic heardthe services performed quietly and reverently.The best sermon, however, that I listened to, was in a Methodistchurch, from the mouth of a Piquot Indian.  It was impossible notbe touched by the simple sincerity of this poor man.  He gave apicture frightfully eloquent of the decay of his people under theunited influence of the avarice and intemperance of the whitemen.  He described the effect of the religious feeling which hadrecently found its way among them as most salutary.  The purityof his moral feeling, and the sincerity of his sympathy with hisforest brethren, made it unquestionable that he must be the mostvaluable priest who could officiate for them.  His English wasvery correct, and his pronunciation but slightly tinctured bynative accent.While we were still in the neighbourhood of Washington, a mostviolent and unprecedented schism occurred in the cabinet.  Thefour secretaries of State all resigned, leaving General Jacksonto manage the queer little state barge alone.Innumerable contradictory statements appeared upon this occasionin the papers, and many a cigar was thrown aside, ere halfconsumed, that the disinterested politician might give breath tohis cogitations on this extraordinary event; but not all theeloquence of all the smokers, nor even the ultradiplomaticexpositions which appeared from the seceding secretariesthemselves, could throw any light on the mysterious business.It produced, however, the only tolerable caricature I ever sawin the country.  It represents the President seated alone in hiscabinet, wearing a look of much discomfiture, and making greatexertions to detain one of four rats, who are running off, byplacing his foot on the tail.  The rats' heads bear a verysufficient resemblance to the four ex-ministers.  GeneralJackson, it seems, had requested Mr. Van Buren, the Secretary ofState, to remain in office till his place was supplied; this gaveoccasion to a _bon mot_ from his son, who, being asked when hisfather would be in New York, replied, "When the President takesoff his foot."CHAPTER 30Journey to New York--Delaware River--Stagecoach--City of New York--Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies--Theatres--Public Garden--Churches--Morris Canal--Fashions--CarriagesAt length, in spite of the lingering pace necessarily attendingconsultations, and arrangements across the Atlantic, our planswere finally settled; the coming spring was to show us New York,and Niagara, and the early summer was to convey us home.No sooner did the letter arrive which decided this, than we beganour preparations for departure.  We took our last voyage on thePotomac, we bade a last farewell to Virginia, and gave a last dayto some of our kind friends near Washington.The spring, though slow and backward, was sufficiently advancedto render the journey pleasant; and though the road fromWashington to Baltimore was less brilliant in foliage than whenI had seen it before, it still had much of beauty.  The azaliaswere in full bloom, and the delicate yellow blossom of thesassafras almost rivalled its fruit in beauty.At Baltimore we again embarked on a gigantic steam-boat, andreached Philadelphia in the middle of the night.  Here we changedour boat and found time, before starting in the morning, to takea last look at the Doric and Corinthian porticos of the twocelebrated temples dedicated to Mammon.The Delaware river, above Philadelphia, still flows through alandscape too level for beauty, but it is rendered interesting bya succession of gentlemen's seats, which, if less elaboratelyfinished in architecture, and garden grounds, than the lovelyvillas on the Thames, are still beautiful objects to gaze upon asyou float rapidly past on the broad silvery stream that washestheir lawns They present a picture of wealth and enjoyment thataccords well with the noble city to which they are an appendage.One mansion arrested our attention, not only from its being morethan usually large and splendid, but from its having the monumentwhich marked the family resting-place, rearing itself in all thegloomy grandeur of black and white marble, exactly opposite thedoor of entrance.In Virginia and Maryland we had remarked that almost every familymansion had its little grave yard, sheltered by locust andcypress trees; but this decorated dwelling of the dead seemedrather a melancholy ornament in the grounds.We had, for a considerable distance, a view of the dwelling ofJoseph Bonaparte, which is situated on the New Jersey shore, inthe midst of an extensive tract of land, of which he is theproprietor.Here the ex-monarch has built several houses, which are occupiedby French tenants.  The country is very flat, but a terrace oftwo sides has been raised, commanding a fine reach of theDelaware River; at the point where this terrace forms a rightangle, a lofty chapel has been erected, which looks very muchlike an observatory; I admired the ingenuity with which theCatholic prince has united his religion and his love of a fineterrestrial prospect.  The highest part of the building presents,in every direction, the appearance of an immense cross; thetransept, if I may so express it, being formed by the projectionof an ample balcony, which surrounds a tower.  A Quakergentleman, from Philadelphia, exclaimed, as he gazed on themansion, "There we see a monument of fallen royalty!  Strange!that dethroned kings should seek and find their best strong-holdin a Republic."There was more of philosophy than of scorn in his accent, and hiscountenance was the symbol of gentleness and benevolence; but Ioverheard many unquakerlike jokes from others, as to thecomfortable assurance a would-be king must feel of a faithfulalliance between his head and shoulders.At Trenton, the capital of New Jersey, we left oursmoothly-gliding comfortable boat for the most detestablestage-coach that ever Christian built to dislocate the joints ofhis fellow men.  Ten of these torturing machines were crammedfull of the passengers who left the boat with us.  The change inour movement was not more remarkable than that which took placein the tempers and countenances of our fellow-travellers.Gentlemen who had lounged on sofas, and balanced themselves inchairs, all the way from Philadelphia, with all the consciousfascinations of stiff stays and neck-cloths, which, while doingto death the rash beauties who ventured to gaze, seemed but awhalebone panoply to guard the wearer, these pretty youths soguarded from without, so sweetly at peace within, now crushedbeneath their armour, looked more like victims on the wheel, thandandies armed for conquest; their whalebones seemed to enter intotheir souls, and every face grew grim and scowling.  The prettyladies too, with their expansive bonnets, any one of which mighthandsomely have filled the space allotted to three,--how sad thechange!  I almost fancied they must have been of the race ofUndine, and that it was only when they heard the splashing ofwater that they could smile.  As I looked into the altered eyesof my companions, I was tempted to ask, "Look I as cross as you?"Indeed, I believe that, if possible, I looked crosser still, forthe roads and the vehicle together were quite too much for myphilosophy.At length, however, we found ourselves alive on board the boatwhich was to convey us down the Raraton River to New York.We fully intended to have gone to bed, to heal our bones, onentering the steam-boat, but the sight of a table neatly spreaddetermined us to go to dinner instead.  Sin and shame would ithave been, indeed, to have closed our eyes upon the scene whichsoon opened before us.  I have never seen the bay of Naples, Ican therefore make no comparison, but my imagination is incapableof conceiving any thing of the kind more beautiful than theharbour of New York.  Various and lovely are the objects whichmeet the eye on every side, but the naming them would only be togive a list of words, without conveying the faintest idea of thescene.  I doubt if ever the pencil of Turner could do it justice,bright and glorious as it rose upon us.  We seemed to enter theharbour of New York upon waves of liquid gold, and as we dartedpast the green isles which rise from its bosom, like guardiancentinels of the fair city, the setting sun stretched hishorizontal beams farther and farther at each moment, as if topoint out to us some new glory in the landscape.New York, indeed, appeared to us, even when we saw it by asoberer light, a lovely and a noble city.  To us who had been solong travelling through half-cleared forests, and sojourningamong an "I'm-as-good-as-you" population, it seemed, perhaps,more beautiful, more splendid, and more refined than it mighthave done, had we arrived there directly from London; but makingevery allowance for this, I must still declare that I think NewYork one of the finest cities I ever saw, and as much superior toevery other in the Union (Philadelphia not excepted), as Londonto Liverpool, or Paris to Rouen.  Its advantages of position are,perhaps, unequalled any where.  Situated on an island, which Ithink it will one day cover, it rises, like Venice, from the sea,and like that fairest of cities in the days of her glory,receives into its lap tribute of all the riches of the earth.The southern point of Manhatten Island divides the waters of theharbour into the north and east rivers; on this point stands thecity of New York, extending from river to river, and runningnorthward to the extent of three or four miles.  I think itcovers nearly as much ground as Paris, but is much less thicklypeopled.  The extreme point is fortified towards the sea by abattery, and forms an admirable point of defence; I shouldsuppose, no city could boast.  From hence commences the splendidBroadway, as the fine avenue is called, which runs through thewhole city.  This noble street may vie with any I ever saw, forits length and breadth, its handsome shops, neat awnings,excellent _trottoir_, and well-dressed pedestrians.  It has notthe crowded glitter of Bond Street equipages, nor the gorgeousfronted palaces of Regent Street; but it is magnificent in itsextent, and ornamented by several handsome buildings, some ofthem surrounded by grass and trees.  The Park, in which standsthe noble city-hall, is a very fine area, I never found that themost graphic description of a city could give me any feeling ofbeing there; and even if others have the power, I am very sure Ihave not, of setting churches and squares, and long drawnstreets, before the mind's eye.  I will not, therefore, attempt adetailed description of this great metropolis of the new world,but will only say that during the seven weeks we stayed there, wealways found something new to see and to admire; and were it notso very far from all the old-world things which cling about theheart of an European, I should say that I never saw a city moredesirable as a residence.The dwelling houses of the higher classes are extremely handsome,and very richly furnished.  Silk or satin furniture is as often,or oftener, seen than chintz; the mirrors are as handsome as inLondon; the cheffoniers, slabs, and marble tables as elegant; andin addition, they have all the pretty tasteful decoration ofFrench porcelaine, and or-molu in much greater abundance, becauseat a much cheaper rate.  Every part of their houses is wellcarpeted, and the exterior finishing, such as steps, railings,and door-frames, are very superior.  Almost every house hashandsome green blinds on the outside; balconies are not verygeneral, nor do the houses display, externally, so many flowersas those of Paris and London; but I saw many rooms decoratedwithin, exactly like those of an European _petite maitresse_.Little tables, looking and smelling like flower beds, portfolios,nick-nacks, bronzes, busts, cameos, and alabaster vases,illustrated copies of ladylike rhymes bound in silk, and, inshort, all the pretty coxcomalities of the drawing-room scatteredabout with the same profuse and studied negligence as with us.Hudson Square and its neighbourhood is, I believe, the mostfashionable part of the town; the square is beautiful,excellently well planted with a great variety of trees, and onlywanting our frequent and careful mowing to make it equal to anysquare in London.  The iron railing which surrounds thisenclosure is as high and as handsome as that of the Tuilleries,and it will give some idea of the care bestowed on itsdecoration, to know that the gravel for the walks was conveyedby barges from Boston, not as ballast, but as freight.The great defect in the houses is their extreme uniformity whenyou have seen one, you have seen all.  Neither do I quite likethe arrangement of the rooms.  In nearly all the houses thedining and drawing rooms are on the same floor, with amplefolding doors between them; when thrown together they certainlymake a very noble apartment; but no doors can be barriersufficient between dining and drawing-rooms.  Mixed dinnerparties of ladies and gentlemen, however, are very rare, which isa great defect in the society; not only as depriving them of themost social and hospitable manner of meeting, but as leading tofrequent dinner parties of gentlemen without ladies, whichcertainly does not conduce to refinement.The evening parties, excepting such as are expressly for youngpeople, are chiefly conversational; we were too late in theseason for large parties, but we saw enough to convince us thatthere is society to be met with in New York, which would bedeemed delightful any where.  Cards are very seldom used; andmusic, from their having very little professional aid at theirparties is seldom, I believe, as good as what is heard at privateconcerts in London.The Americans have certainly not the same _besoin_ of beingamused, as other people; they may be the wiser for this, perhaps,but it makes them less agreeable to a looker-on.There are three theatres at New York, all of which we visited.The Park Theatre is the only one licensed by fashion, but theBowery is infinitely superior in beauty; it is indeed as pretty atheatre as I ever entered, perfect as to size and proportion,elegantly decorated, and the scenery and machinery equal to anyin London, but it is not the fashion.  The Chatham is so utterlycondemned by _bon ton_, that it requires some courage to decideupon going there; nor do I think my curiosity would havepenetrated so far, had I not seen Miss Mitford's Rienziadvertised there.  It was the first opportunity I had had ofseeing it played, and spite of very indifferent acting, I wasdelighted.  The interest must have been great, for till thecurtain fell, I saw not one quarter of the queer things aroundme: then I observed in the front row of a dress-box a ladyperforming the most maternal office possible; several gentlemenwithout their coats, and a general air of contempt for thedecencies of life, certainly more than usually revolting.At the Park Theatre I again saw the American Roscius, Mr.Forrest.  He played the part of Damon, and roared, I thought,very unlike a nightingale.  I cannot admire this celebratedperformer.Another night we saw Cinderella there; Mrs. Austin was the primadonna, and much admired.  The piece was extremely well got up,and on this occasion we saw the Park Theatre to advantage, for itwas filled with well-dressed company; but still we saw many "yetunrazored lips" polluted with the grim tinge of the hatefultobacco, and heard, without ceasing, the spitting, which ofcourse is its consequence.  If their theatres had the orchestraof the Feydeau, and a choir of angels to boot, I could find butlittle pleasure, so long as they were followed by this runningaccompaniment of _thorough base_.Whilst at New York, the prospectus of a fashionableboarding-school was presented to me.  I made some extracts fromit, as a specimen of the enlarged scale of instruction proposedfor young females.

Thechurches are plain, but very neat, and kept in perfect repairwithin and without; but I saw none which had the least pretensionto splendour; the Catholic Cathedral at Baltimore is the onlychurch in America which has.At New York, as every where else, they show within, during thetime of service, like beds of tulips, so gay, so bright, sobeautiful, are the long rows of French bonnets and pretty faces;rows but rarely broken by the unribboned heads of the malepopulation; the proportion is about the same as I have remarkedelsewhere.  Excepting at New York, I never saw the other side ofthe picture, but there I did.  On the opposite side of the NorthRiver, about three miles higher up, is a place called Hoboken.A gentleman who possessed a handsome mansion and grounds there,also possessed the right of ferry, and to render this productive,he has restricted his pleasure grounds to a few beautiful acres,laying out the remainder simply and tastefully as a public walk.It is hardly possible to imagine one of greater attraction; abroad belt of light underwood and flowering shrubs, studded atintervals with lofty forest trees, runs for two miles along acliff which overhangs the matchless Hudson; sometimes it feathersthe rocks down to its very margin, and at others leaves a pebblyshore, just rude enough to break the gentle waves, and make amusic which mimics softly the loud chorus of the ocean.  Throughthis beautiful little wood, a broad well gravelled terrace is ledby every point which can exhibit the scenery to advantage;narrower and wilder paths diverge at intervals, some into thedeeper shadow of the wood, and some shelving gradually to thepretty coves below.The price of entrance to this little Eden, is the six cents youpay at the ferry.  We went there on a bright Sunday afternoon,expressly to see the humours of the place.  Many thousand personswere scattered through the grounds; of these we ascertained, byrepeatedly counting, that nineteen-twentieths were men.  Theladies were at church.  Often as the subject has pressed upon mymind, I think I never so strongly felt the conviction that theSabbath-day, the holy day, the day on which alone the greatmajority of the Christian world can spend their hours as theyplease, is ill passed (if passed entirely) within brick walls,listening to an earth-born preacher, charm he never so wisely.  "Oh! how can they renounce the boundless store   Of charms, which Nature to her vot'ries yields!   The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,   The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields,   All that the genial ray of morning gilds,   And all that echoes to the song of even,   All that the mountain's sheltering bosom yields,   And all the dread magnificence of heaven;   Oh! how can they renounce, and hope to be forgiven!"How is it that the men of America, who are reckoned good husbandsand good fathers, while they themselves enjoy sufficient freedomof spirit to permit their walking forth into the temple of theliving God, can leave those they love best on earth, bound in theiron chains of a most tyrannical fanaticism?  How can theybreathe the balmy air, and not think of the tainted atmosphere soheavily weighing upon breasts still dearer than their own?  Howcan they gaze upon the blossoms of the spring, and not rememberthe fairer cheeks of their young daughters, waxing pale, as theysit for long sultry hours, immured with hundreds of fellowvictims, listening to the roaring vanities of a preachercanonized by a college of old women?  They cannot think itneedful to salvation,or they would not withdraw themselves.Wherefore is it?  Do they fear these self-elected, self-ordainedpriests, and offer up their wives and daughters to propitiatethem?  Or do they deem their hebdomadal freedom more complete,because their wives and daughters are shut up four or five timesin the day at church or chapel?  It is true, that at Hoboken, asevery where else, there are _reposoires_, which, as you passthem, blast the sense for a moment, by reeking forth the fumes ofwhiskey and tobacco, and it may be that these cannot be enteredwith a wife or daughter.  The proprietor of the grounds, however,has contrived with great taste to render these abominations notunpleasing to the eye; there is one in particular, which hasquite the air of a Grecian temple, and did they drink wineinstead of whiskey, it might be inscribed to Bacchus; but in thisparticular, as in many others, the ancient and modern Republics differ.It is impossible not to feel, after passing one Sunday in thechurches and chapels of New York, and the next in the gardens ofHoboken, that the thousands of well-dressed men you see enjoyingthemselves at the latter, have made over the thousands ofwell-dressed women you saw exhibited at the former, into thehands of the priests, at least, for the day.  The American peoplearrogate to themselves a character of superior morality andreligion, but this division of their hours of leisure does notgive me a favourable idea of either.I visited all the exhibitions in New York.  The Medici of theRepublic must exert themselves a little more before these canbecome even respectable.  The worst of the business is, that withthe exception of about half a dozen individuals, the goodcitizens are more than contented, they are delighted.The newspaper lungs of the Republic breathe forth praise andtriumph, may, almost pant with extacy in speaking of their native_chef d'oeuvres_.  I should be hardly believed were I to relatethe instances which fell in my way, of the utter ignorancerespecting pictures to be found among persons of the _firststanding_ in society.  Often where a liberal spirit exists, and awish to patronise the fine arts is expressed, it is joined to aprofundity of ignorance on the subject almost inconceivable.  Adoubt as to the excellence of their artists is very nervouslyreceived, and one gentleman, with much civility, told me, that atthe present era, all the world were aware that competition waspretty well at an end between our two nations, and that a littleenvy might naturally be expected to mix with the surprise withwhich the mother country beheld the distance at which hercolonies were leaving her behind them.I must, however, do the few artists with whom I becameacquainted, the justice to say, that their own pretensions aremuch more modest than those of their patrons for them.  I haveheard several confess and deplore their ignorance of drawing, andhave repeatedly remarked a sensibility to the merit of Europeanartists, though perhaps only known by engravings, and a deferenceto their authority, which showed a genuine feeling for the art.In fact, I think that there is a very considerable degree ofnatural talent for painting in America, but it has to make itsway through darkness and thick night.  When an academy isfounded, their first care is to hang the walls of its exhibitionroom with all the unutterable trash that is offered to them.  Noliving models are sought for; no discipline as to the manner ofstudy is enforced.  Boys who know no more of human form, thanthey do of the eyes, nose, and mouth in the moon, begin paintingportraits.  If some of them would only throw away their palettesfor a year, and learn to draw; if they would attend anatomicallectures, and take notes, not in words, but in forms, of jointsand muscles, their exhibitions would soon cease to be so utterlybelow criticism.The most interesting exhibition open when I was there was,decidedly, Colonel Trumbold's; and how the patriots of Americacan permit this truly national collection to remain a profitlessburden on the hands of the artist, it is difficult to understand.Many of the sketches are masterly; but like his illustriouscountryman, West, his sketches are his _chef d'oeuvres_.I can imagine nothing more perfect than the interior of thepublic institutions of New York.  There is a practical good sensein all their arrangements that must strike foreigners veryforcibly.  The Asylum for the Destitute offers a hint worthtaking.  It is dedicated to the reformation of youthful offendersof both sexes, and it is as admirable in the details of itsmanagement, as in its object.  Every part of the institution isdeeply interesting; but there is a difference very remarkablebetween the boys and the girls.  The boys are, I think, thefinest set of lads I ever saw brought together; bright looking,gay, active, and full of intelligence.  The girls are exactly inreverse; heavy, listless, indifferent, and melancholy.  Inconversing with the gentleman who is the general superintendantof the establishment, I made the remark to him, and he told me,that the reality corresponded with the appearance.  All of themhad been detected in some act of dishonesty; but the boys, whenremoved from the evil influence which had led them so to usetheir ingenuity, rose like a spring when a pressure is withdrawn;and feeling themselves once more safe from danger and from shame,hope and cheerfulness animated every countenance.  But the pourgirls, on the contrary, can hardly look up again.  They are asdifferent as an oak and a lily after a storm.  The one, when thefresh breeze blows over it, shakes the raindrops from its crest,and only looks the brighter; the other, its silken leaves oncesoiled, shrinks from the eye, and is levelled to the earth forever.We spent a delightful day in New Jersey, in visiting, with a mostagreeable party, the inclined planes, which are used instead oflocks on the Morris canal.This is a very interesting work; it is one among a thousand whichprove the people of America to be the most enterprising in theworld.  I was informed that this important canal, which connectsthe waters of the Hudson and the Delaware, is a hundred mileslong, and in this distance overcomes a variation of levelamounting to sixteen hundred feet.  Of this, fourteen hundred areachieved by inclined planes.  The planes average about sixty feetof perpendicular lift each, and are to support about forty tons.The time consumed in passing them is twelve minutes for onehundred feet of perpendicular rise.  The expense is less than athird of what locks would be for surmounting the same rise.  Ifwe set about any more canals, this may be worth attending to.This Morris canal is certainly an extraordinary work; it not onlyvaries its level sixteen hundred feet, but at one point runsalong the side of a mountain at thirty feet above the tops of thehighest buildings in the town of Paterson, below; at another itcrosses the falls of the Passaic in a stone aqueduct sixty feetabove the water in the river.  This noble work, in a greatdegree, owes its existence to the patriotic and scientific energyof Mr. Cadwallader Colden.There is no point in the national character of the Americanswhich commands so much respect as the boldness and energy withwhich public works are undertaken and carried through.  Nothingstops them if a profitable result can be fairly hoped for.  It isthis which has made cities spring up amidst the forests with suchinconceivable rapidity; and could they once be thoroughlypersuaded that any point of the ocean had a hoard of dollarsbeneath it, I have not the slightest doubt that in about eighteenmonths we should see a snug covered rail-road leading direct tothe spot.I was told at New York, that in many parts of the state it wasusual to pay the service of the Presbyterian ministers in thefollowing manner.  Once a year a day is fixed, on which somemember of every family in a congregation meet at their minister'shouse in the afternoon.  They each bring an offering (accordingto their means) of articles necessary for housekeeping.  Thepoorer members leave their contributions in a large basket,placed for the purpose, close to the door of entrance.  Those ofmore importance, and more calculated to do honour to the piety ofthe donors, are carried into the room where the company isassembled.  Sugar, coffee, tea, cheese, barrels of flour, piecesof Irish linen, sets of china and of glass, were among thearticles mentioned to me as usually making parts of theseofferings.  After the party is assembled, and the business ofgiving and receiving is dispatched, tea, coffee, and cakes arehanded round; but these are not furnished at any expense eitherof trouble or money to the minster, for selected ladies of thecongregation take the whole arrangement upon themselves.  Thesemeetings are called spinning visits.Another New York custom, which does not seem to have soreasonable a cause, is the changing house once a year.  On the1st of May the city of New York has the appearance of sending offa population flying from the plague, or of a town which hadsurrendered on condition of carrying away all their goods andchattels.  Rich furniture and ragged furniture, carts, waggons,and drays, ropes, canvas, and straw, packers, porters, anddraymen, white, yellow, and black, occupy the streets from eastto west, from north to south, on this day.  Every one I spoke toon the subject complained of this custom as most annoying, butall assured me it was unavoidable, if you inhabit a rented house.More than one of my New York friends have built or bought housessolely to avoid this annual inconvenience.There are a great number of negroes in New York, all free; theiremancipation having been completed in 1827.  Not even inPhiladelphia, where the anti-slavery opinions have been the mostactive and violent, do the blacks appear to wear an air of somuch consequence as they do at New York.  They have severalchapels, in which negro ministers officiate; and a theatre inwhich none but negroes perform.  At this theatre a gallery isappropriated to such whites as choose to visit it; and here onlyare they permitted to sit; following in this, with niceetiquette, and equal justice, the arrangement of the whitetheatres, in all of which is a gallery appropriated solely to theuse of the blacks.  I have often, particularly on a Sunday, metgroups of negroes, elegantly dressed; and have been sometimesamused by observing the very superior air of gallantry assumed bythe men, when in attendance on their _belles_, to that of thewhites in similar circumstances.  On one occasion we met inBroadway a young negress in the extreme of the fashion, andaccompanied by a black beau, whose toilet was equally studied;eye-glass, guard-chain, nothing was omitted; he walked beside hissable goddess uncovered, and with an air of the most tenderdevotion.  At the window of a handsome house which they werepassing, stood a very pretty white girl, with two gentlemenbeside her; but alas! both of them had their hats on, and onewas smoking!If it were not for the peculiar manner of walking, whichdistinguishes all American women, Broadway might be taken for aFrench street, where it was the fashion for very smart ladies topromenade.  The dress is entirely French; not an article (exceptperhaps the cotton stockings) must be English, on pain of beingstigmatized as out of the fashion.  Every thing English isdecidedly _mauvais ton_; English materials, English fashions,English accent, English manner, are all terms of reproach; and tosay that an unfortunate looks like an English woman, is thecruellest satire which can be uttered.I remember visiting France almost immediately after we had madethe most offensive invasion of her territory that can well beimagined, yet, despite the feelings which lengthened years of warmust have engendered, it was the fashion to admire every thingEnglish.  I suppose family quarrels are most difficult to adjust;for fifteen years of peace have not been enough to calm the angryfeelings of brother Jonathan towards the land of his fathers,     "The which he hateth passing well."It is hardly needful to say the most courteous amenity of mannerdistinguishes the reception given to foreigners by the patricianclass of Americans._Gentlemen_, in the old world sense of the term, are the sameevery where; and an American gentleman and his family know how todo the honours of their country to strangers of every nation, aswell as any people on earth.  But this class, though it decidedlyexists, is a very small one, and cannot, in justice, berepresented as affording a specimen of the whole.Most of the houses in New York are painted on the outside, but ina manner carefully to avoid disfiguring the material which itpreserves: on the contrary, nothing can be neater.  They are nowusing a great deal of a beautiful stone called Jersey freestone;it is of a warm rich brown, and extremely ornamental to the citywherever it has been employed.  They have also a grey granite ofgreat beauty.  The trottoir paving, in most of the streets, isextremely good, being of large flag stones, very superior to thebricks of Philadelphia.At night the shops, which are open till very late, arebrilliantly illuminated with gas, and all the population seem asmuch alive as in London or Paris.  This makes the solemnstillness of the evening hours in Philadelphia still moreremarkable.There are a few trees in different parts of the city, and Iobserved young ones planted, and guarded with much care; werethey more abundant it would be extremely agreeable, for thereflected light of their fierce summer sheds intolerable day.Ice is in profuse abundance; I do not imagine that there is ahouse in the city without the luxury of a piece of ice to coolthe water, and harden the butter.The hackney coaches are the best in the world, but abominablydear, and it is necessary to be on the _qui vive_ in making yourbargain with the driver; if you do not, he has the power ofcharging immoderately.  On my first experiment I neglected this,and was asked two dollars and a half for an excursion of twentyminutes.  When I referred to the waiter of the hotel, he asked ifI had made a bargain.  "No." "Then I expect" (with the usual lookof triumph) "that the Yankee has been too smart for you."The private carriages of New York are infinitely handsomer andbetter appointed than any I saw elsewhere; the want of smartliveries destroys much of the gay effect, but, on the whole, aNew York summer equipage, with the pretty women and beautifulchildren it contains, look extremely well in Broadway, and wouldnot be much amiss anywhere.The luxury of the New York aristocracy is not confined to thecity; hardly an acre of Manhatten Island but shows some prettyvilla or stately mansion.  The most chosen of these are on thenorth and east rivers, to whose margins their lawns descend.Among these, perhaps, the loveliest is one situated in thebeautiful village of Bloomingdale; here, within the space ofsixteen acres, almost every variety of garden scenery may befound.  To describe all its diversity of hill and dale, of woodand lawn, of rock and river, would be in vain; nor can I conveyan idea of it by comparison, for I never saw anything like it.How far the elegant hospitality which reigns there may influencemy impression, I know not; but, assuredly, no spot I have everseen dwells more freshly on my memory, nor did I ever find myselfin a circle more calculated to give delight in meeting, andregret at parting, than that of Woodlawn.CHAPTER 31Reception of Captain Basil Hall's Book in the United StatesHaving now arrived nearly at the end of our travels, I aminduced, ere I conclude, again to mention what I consider as oneof the most remarkable traits in the national character of theAmericans; namely, their exquisite sensitiveness and sorenessrespecting everything said or written concerning them.  Of this,perhaps, the most remarkable example I can give, is the effectproduced on nearly every class of readers by the appearance ofCaptain Basil Hall's "Travels in North America."  In fact, it wasa sort of moral earthquake, and the vibration it occasionedthrough the nerves of the Republic, from one corner of the Unionto the other, was by no means over when I left the country inJuly, 1831, a couple of years after the shock.I was in Cincinnati when these volumes came out, but it was nottill July, 1830, that I procured a copy of them.  One booksellerto whom I applied, told me that he had had a few copies before heunderstood the nature of the work, but that after becomingacquainted with it, nothing should induce him to sell another.Other persons of his profession must, however, have been lessscrupulous, for the book was read in city, town, village, andhamlet, steam-boat, and stage-coach, and a sort of war-whoop wassent forth perfectly unprecedented in my recollection upon anyoccasion whatever.It was fortunate for me that I did not procure these volumes tillI had heard them very generally spoken of, for the curiosity Ifelt to know the contents of a work so violently anathematised,led me to make enquiries which elicited a great deal of curiousfeeling.An ardent desire for approbation, and delicate sensitivenessunder censure, have always, I believe, been considered as amiabletraits of character; but the condition into which the appearanceof Capt. Hall's work threw the Republic, shows plainly thatthese feelings, if carried to excess, produce a weakness whichamounts to imbecility.It was perfectly astonishing to hear men, who, on other subjects,were sane of judgment, utter their opinions upon this.  I neverheard of any instance in which the common sense generally foundin national criticism was so overthrown by passion.  I do notspeak of the want of justice, and of fair and liberalinterpretation: these, perhaps, were hardly to be expected.Other nations have been called thin-skinned, but the citizens ofthe Union have, apparently, no skins at all; they wince if abreeze blows over them, unless it be tempered with adulation.  Itwas not, therefore, very surprising that the acute and forcibleobservations of a traveller they knew would be listened to,should be received testily.  The extraordinary features of thebusiness were, first, the excess of the rage into which theylashed themselves; and secondly, the puerility of the inventionsby which they attempted to account for the severity with whichthey fancied they had been treated.Not content with declaring that the volumes contained no word oftruth from beginning to end (which is an assertion I heard madevery nearly as often as they were mentioned), the whole countryset to work to discover the causes why Capt. Hall had visitedthe United States, and why he had published his book.I have heard it said with as much precision and gravity as if thestatement had been conveyed by an official report, that Capt.Hall had been sent out by the British government expressly forthe purpose of checking the growing admiration of England for thegovernment of the United States, that it was by a commission fromthe Treasury he had come, and that it was only in obedience toorders that he had found anything to object to.I do not give this as the gossip of a coterie; I am persuadedthat it is the belief of a very considerable portion of thecountry.  So deep is the conviction of this singular people thatthey cannot be seen without being admired, that they will notadmit the possibility that anyone should honestly and sincerelyfind aught to disapprove in them, or their country.At Philadelphia I met with a little anonymous book, written toshow that Capt. Basil Hall was in no way to be depended on, forthat he not only slandered the Americans, but was himself, inother respects, a person of very equivocal morals.  One proof ofthis is given by a quotation of the following playful account ofthe distress occasioned by the want of a bell.  The commentatorcalls it an instance of "shocking coarseness.""One day I was rather late for breakfast, and as there was nowater in my jug, I set off, post haste, half shaved, halfdressed, and more than half vexed, in quest of water, like aseaman on short allowance, hunting for rivulets on some unknowncoast.  I went up stairs, and down stairs, and in the course ofmy researches into half a dozen different apartments, might havestumbled on some lady's chamber, as the song says, whichconsidering the plight I was in, would have been awkward enough."Another indication of this moral coarseness is pointed out in thepassage where Capt. Hall says, he never saw a flirtation all thetime he was in the Union.The charge of ingratitude also was echoed from mouth to mouth.That he should himself bear testimony to the unvarying kindnessof the reception he met with, and yet find fault with thecountry, was declared on all hands to be a proof of the mostabominable ingratitude that it ever entered into the heart of manto conceive.  I once ventured before about a dozen people to askwhether more blame would not attach to an author, if he sufferedhimself to be bribed by individual kindness to falsify facts,than if, despite all personal considerations, he stated themtruly?"Facts!" cried the whole circle at once, "facts! I tell you thereis not a word of fact in it from beginning to end."The American Reviews are, many of them, I believe, well known inEngland; I need not, therefore, quote them here, but I sometimeswondered that they, none of them, ever thought of translatingObadiah's curse into classic American; if they had done so, onlyplacing (he, Basil Hall,) between brackets instead of (he,Obadiah,) it would have saved them a world of trouble.I can hardly describe the curiosity with which I sat down atlength to pursue these tremendous volumes; still less can I dojustice to my surprise at their contents.  To say that I foundnot one exaggerated statement throughout the work, is by no meanssaying enough.  It is impossible for any one who knows thecountry not to see that Captain Hall earnestly sought out thingsto admire and commend.  When he praises, it is with evidentpleasure, and when he finds fault, it is with evident reluctanceand restraint, excepting where motives purely patriotic urge himto state roundly what it is for the benefit of his country shouldbe known.In fact, Captain Hall saw the country to the greatest possibleadvantage.  Furnished, of course, with letters of introduction tothe most distinguished individuals, and with the still moreinfluential recommendation of his own reputation, he was receivedin full drawing-room style and state from one end of the Union tothe other.  He saw the country in full dress, and had little orno opportunity of judging of it unhouselled, disappointed,unannealed, with all its imperfections on its head, as I and myfamily too often had.Captain Hall had certainly excellent opportunities of makinghimself acquainted with the form of the government and the laws;and of receiving, moreover, the best oral commentary upon them,in conversation with the most distinguished citizens.  Of theseopportunities he made excellent use; nothing important met hiseye which did not receive that sort of analytical attention whichan experienced and philosophical traveller alone can give.  Thishas made his volumes highly interesting and valuable; but I amdeeply persuaded, that were a man of equal penetration to visitthe United States with no other means of becoming acquainted withthe national character than the ordinary working-day intercourseof life, he would conceive an infinitely lower idea of the moralatmosphere of the country than Captain Hall appears to have done;and the internal conviction on my mind is strong, that if CaptainHall had not placed a firm restraint on himself, he must havegiven expression to far deeper indignation than any he hasuttered against many points in the American character, with whichhe shows, from other circumstances, that he was well acquainted.His rule appears to have been to state just so much of the truthas would leave on the minds of his readers a correct impression,at the least cost of pain to the sensitive folks he was writingabout.  He states his own opinions and feelings, and leaves it tobe inferred that he has good grounds for adopting them; but hespares the Americans the bitterness which a detail of thecircumstances would have produced.If any one chooses to say that some wicked antipathy to twelvemillions of strangers is the origin of my opinion, I must bearit; and were the question one of mere idle speculation, Icertainly would not court the abuse I must meet for stating it.But it is not so.  I know that among the best, the most pious,the most benevolent of my countrymen, there are hundreds, nay, Ifear thousands, who conscientiously believe that a greater degreeof political and religious liberty (such as is possessed inAmerica) would be beneficial for us.  How often have I wished,during my abode in the United States, that one of theseconscientious, but mistaken reasoners, fully possessed of hiscountry's confidence, could pass a few years in the UnitedStates, sufficiently among the mass of the citizens to know them,and sufficiently at leisure to trace effects to their causes.Then might we look for a statement which would teach thesemistaken philanthropists to tremble at every symptom ofdemocratic power among us; a statement which would make even oursectarians shudder at the thought of hewing down the EstablishedChurch, for they would be taught, by fearful example, to knowthat it was the bulwark which protects us from the gloomy horrorsof fanatic superstition on one side, and the still more dreadfulinroads of infidelity on the other.  And more than all, such aman would see as clear as light, that where every class isoccupied in getting money, and no class in spending it, therewill neither be leisure for worshipping the theory of honesty,nor motive strong enough to put its restrictive doctrine inpractice.  Where every man is engaged in driving hard bargainswith his fellows, where is the honoured class to be found intowhich gentleman-like feelings, principles, and practice, arenecessary as an introduction?That there are men of powerful intellect, benevolent hearts, andhigh moral feeling in America, I know: and I could, if challengedto do so, name individuals surpassed by none of any country inthese qualities; but they are excellent, despite theirinstitutions, not in consequence of them.  It is not by such thatCaptain Hall's statements are called slanders, nor is it fromsuch that I shall meet the abuse which I well know these pageswill inevitably draw upon me; and I only trust I may beable to muster as much self-denial as my predecessor, who assertsin his recently published "Fragments," that he has read none ofthe American criticisms on his book.  He did wisely, if he wishedto retain an atom of his kindly feeling toward America, and hehas, assuredly, lost but little on the score of information, forthese criticisms, generally speaking, consist of mere downrightpersonal abuse, or querulous complaints of his ingratitude andill usage of them; complaints which it is quite astonishing thatany persons of spirit could indulge in.The following good-humoured paragraphs from the Fragments, must,I think, rather puzzle the Americans.  Possibly they may thinkthat Captain Hall is quizzing them, when he says he has read noneof their criticisms; but I think there is in these passagesinternal evidence that he has not seen them.  For if he had readone-fiftieth part of the vituperation of his Travels, which ithas been my misfortune to peruse, he could hardly have broughthimself to write what follows.If the Americans still refuse to shake the hand proffered to themin the true old John Bull spirit, they are worse folks than evenI take them for.Captain Hall, after describing the hospitable reception heformerly met with, at a boarding-house in New York, goes onthus:--"If our hostess be still alive, I hope she will not repentof having bestowed her obliging attentions on one, who so manyyears afterwards made himself, he fears, less popular in herland, than he could wish to be amongst a people to whom he owesso much, and for whom he really feels so much kindness.  He stillanxiously hopes, however, they will believe him, when hedeclares, that, having said in his recent publication no morethan what he conceived was due to strict truth, and to theintegrity of history, as far as his observations and opinionswent, he still feels, as he always has, and ever must continue tofeel towards America, the heartiest good-will."The Americans are perpetually repeating that thefoundation-stone of their liberty is fixed on the doctrine, thatevery man is free to form his own opinions, and to promulgatethem in candour and in moderation.  Is it meant that a foreigneris excluded from these privileges?  If not, may I ask, in whatrespect have I passed these limitations?  The Americans havesurely no fair right to be offended because my views differ fromtheir's; and yet I am told I have been rudely handled by thepress of that country.  If my motives are distrusted, I can onlysay, I am sorely belied.  If I am mistaken, regret at mypolitical blindness were surely more dignified than anger on thepart of those with whom I differ; and if it shall chance that Iam in the right, the best confirmation of the correctness of myviews, in the opinion of indifferent persons, will perhaps befound in the soreness of those, who wince when the truth isspoken."Yet, after all, few things would give me more real pleasure,than to know that my friends across the water would consent totake me at my word; and, considering what I have said about themas so much public matter, which it truly is, agree to reckon me,in my absence, and they always did, when I was amongst them, and,I am sure, they would count me, if I went back again, as aprivate friend.  I differed with them in politics, and I differwith them now as much as ever; but I sincerely wish themhappiness individually; and, as a nation, I shall rejoice if theyprosper.  As the Persians write, "What can I say more?"  And Ionly hope these few words may help to make my peace with peoplewho justly pride themselves on bearing no malice.  As for myself,I have no peace to make; for I have studiously avoided readingany of the American criticisms on my book, in order that thekindly feelings I have ever entertained towards that countryshould not be ruffled.  By this abstinence I may have lost someinformation, and perhaps missed many opportunities of correctingerroneous impressions.  But I set so much store by the pleasingrecollection of the journey itself, and of the hospitality withwhich my family were every where received, that whether it beright, or whether it be wrong, I cannot bring myself to readanything which might disturb these agreeable associations.So let us part in peace; or, rather, let us meet again incordial communication; and if this little work shall find itsway across the Atlantic, I hope it will be read there withoutreference to anything that has passed between us; or, at allevents, with reference only to those parts of our formerintercourse, which are satisfactory to all parties."--_Hall'sFragments_, Vol.1.p.200.I really think it is impossible to read, not only this passage,but many others in these delightful little volumes, withoutfeeling that their author is as little likely to deserve theimputation of harshness and ill-will, as any man that ever lived.In reading Capt. Hall's volumes on America, the observationwhich, I think, struck me the most forcibly, and which certainlycame the most completely home to my own feelings, was thefollowing."In all my travels both amongst Heathens, and amongst Christians,I have never encountered any people by whom I found it nearly sodifficult to make myself understood as by the Americans."I have conversed in London and in Paris with foreigners of manynations, and often through the misty medium of an idiomimperfectly understood, but I remember no instance in which Ifound the same difficulty in conveying my sentiments, myimpressions, and my opinions to those around me, as I did inAmerica.  Whatever faith may be given to my assertion, no one whohas not visited the country can possibly conceive to what extentit is true.  It is less necessary, I imagine, for the mutualunderstanding of persons conversing together, that the languageshould be the same, than that their ordinary mode of thinking,and habits of life should, in some degree, assimilate; whereas,in point of fact, there is hardly a single point of sympathybetween the Americans and us; but whatever the cause, the fact iscertainly as I have stated it, and herein, I think, rests theonly apology for the preposterous and undignified anger felt andexpressed against Capt. Hall's work.  They really cannot, evenif they wished it, enter into any of his views, or comprehend hismost ordinary feelings; and, therefore, they cannot believe inthe sincerity of the impressions he describes.  The candour whichhe expresses, and evidently feels, they mistake for irony, ortotally distrust; his unwillingness to give pain to persons fromwhom he has received kindness, they scornfully reject asaffectation; and, although they must know right well, in theirown secret hearts, how infinitely more they lay at his mercy thanhe has chosen to betray, they pretend, even to themselves, thathe has exaggerated the bad points of their character andinstitutions; whereas, the truth is, that he has let them offwith a degree of tenderness which may be quite suitable for himto exercise, however little merited; while, at the same time, hehas most industriously magnified their merits, whenever he couldpossibly find anything favourable.  One can perfectly wellunderstand why Capt. Hall's avowed Tory principles should bedisapproved of in the United States, especially as (with aquestionable policy in a bookselling point of view, in thesereforming times,) he volunteers a profession of political faith,in which, to use the Kentucky phrase, "he goes the whole hog,"and bluntly avows, in his concluding chapter, that he not onlyholds stoutly to Church and State, but that he conceives theEnglish House of Commons to be, if not quite perfect, at least asmuch so for all the required purposes of representation as it canby possibility be made in practice.  Such a downrightthorough-going Tory and Anti-reformer, pretending to judge of theworkings of the American democratical system, was naturally heldto be a monstrous abomination, and it has been visitedaccordingly, both in America, and as I understand, with us also.The experience which Capt. Hall has acquired in visits to everypart of the world, during twenty or thirty years, goes fornothing with the Radicals on either side the Atlantic: on thecontrary, precisely in proportion to the value of that authoritywhich is the result of actual observation, are they irritated tofind its weight cast into the opposite scale.  Had not Capt.Hall been converted by what he saw in North America, from theWhig faith he exhibited in his description of South America, hisbook would have been far more popular in England during the lasttwo years of public excitement; it may, perhaps, be long beforeany justice is done to Capt. Hall's book in the United States,but a less time will probably suffice to establish its claim toattention at home.CHAPTER 32Journey to Niagara--Hudson--West Point--Hyde Park--Albany--Yankees--Trenton Falls--Rochester--Genesee Falls--LockportHow quickly weeks glide away in such a city as New York,especially when you reckon among your friends some of the mostagreeable people in either hemisphere.  But we had still a longjourney before us, and one of the wonders of the world was to beseen.On the 30th of May we set off for Niagara.  I had heard so muchof the surpassing beauty of the North River, that I expected tobe disappointed, and to find reality flat after description.  Butit is not in the power of man to paint with a strength exceedingthat of nature, in such scenes as the Hudson presents.  Everymile shows some new and startling effect of the combination ofrocks, trees, and water; there is no interval of flat or insipidscenery, from the moment you enter upon the river at New York, tothat of quitting it at Albany, a distance of 180 miles.For the first twenty miles the shore of New Jersey, on the left,offers almost a continued wall of trap rock, which from itsperpendicular form, and lineal fissures, is called the Palisados.This wall sometimes rises to the height of a hundred and fiftyfeet, and sometimes sinks down to twenty.  Here and there, awatercourse breaks its uniformity; and every where the brightestfoliage, in all the splendour of the climate and the season,fringed and chequered the dark barrier.  On the opposite shore,Manhatten Island, with its leafy coronet gemmed with villas,forms a lovely contrast to these rocky heights.After passing Manhatten Island, the eastern shore graduallyassumes a wild and rocky character, but ever varying; woods,lawns, pastures, and towering cliffs all meet the eye in quicksuccession, as the giant steam-boat cleaves its swift passage upthe stream.For several miles the voyage is one of great interest independentof its beauty, for it passes many points where important eventsof the revolutionary war took place.It was not without a pang that I looked on the spot where poorAndre was taken, and another where he was executed.Several forts, generally placed in most commanding situations,still show by their battered ruins, where the struggle wasstrongest, and I felt no lack of that moral interest so entirelywanting in the new States, and without which no journey can, Ithink, continue long without wearying the spirits.About forty miles from New York you enter upon the Highlands, asa series of mountains which then flank the river on both sides,are called.  The beauty of this scenery can only be conceivedwhen it is seen.  One might fancy that these capricious masses,with all their countless varieties of light and shade, werethrown together to show how passing lovely rocks and woods, andwater could be.  Sometimes a lofty peak shoots suddenly up intothe heavens, showing in bold relief against the sky; and then adeep ravine sinks in solemn shadow, and draws the imaginationinto its leafy recesses.  For several miles the river appears toform a succession of lakes; you are often enclosed on all sidesby rocks rising directly from the very edge of the stream, andthen you turn a point, the river widens, and again woods, lawns,and villages are reflected on its bosom.The state prison of Sing Sing is upon the edge of the water, andhas no picturesque effect to atone for the painful images itsuggests; the "Sleepy Hollow" of Washington Irving, just aboveit, restores the imagination to a better tone.West Point, the military academy of the United States, is fiftymiles from New York.  The scenery around it is magnificent, andthough the buildings of the establishment are constructed withthe handsome and unpicturesque regularity which marks the work ofgovernments, they are so nobly placed, and so embosomed in woods,that they look beautiful.  The lengthened notes of a French horn,which I presume was attending some of their military manoeuvres,sounded with deep and solemn sweetness as we passed.About thirty miles further is Hyde Park, the magnificent seat ofDr. Hosack; here the misty summit of the distant Kaatskill beginsto form the outline of the landscape; it is hardly possible toimagine anything more beautiful than this place.  We passed a daythere with great enjoyment; and the following morning set forwardagain in one of those grand floating hotels called steamboats.Either on this day, or the one before, we had two hundred cabinpassengers on board, and they all sat down together to a tablespread abundantly, and with considerable elegance.  A continualsuccession of gentlemen's seats, many of them extremely handsome,borders the river to Albany.  We arrived there late in theevening, but had no difficulty in finding excellentaccommodation.Albany is the state capital of New York, and has some veryhandsome public buildings; there are also some curious relics ofthe old Dutch inhabitants.The first sixteen miles from Albany we travelled in a stage, toavoid a multitude of locks at the entrance of the Erie canal; butat Scenectedy we got on board one of the canal packet-boats forUtica.With a very delightful party, of one's own choosing, finetemperate weather, and a strong breeze to chase the mosquitos,this mode of travelling might be very agreeable, but I can hardlyimagine any motive of convenience powerful enough to induce meagain to imprison myself in a canal boat under ordinarycircumstances.  The accommodations being greatly restricted,every body, from the moment of entering the boat, acts upon asystem of unshrinking egotism.  The library of a dozen books, thebackgammon board, the tiny berths, the shady side of the cabin,are all jostled for in a manner to make one greatly envy thepower of the snail; at the moment I would willingly have given upsome of my human dignity for the privilege of creeping into ashell of my own.  To any one who has been accustomed intravelling, to be addressed with, "Do sit here, you will find itmore comfortable," the "You must go there, I made for this placefirst," sounds very unmusical.There is a great quietness about the women of America (I speak ofthe exterior manner of persons casually met), but somehow orother, I should never call it gentleness.  In such trying momentsas that of _fixing_ themselves on board a packet-boat, the menare prompt, determined, and will compromise any body'sconvenience, except their own.  The women are doggedly stedfastin their will, and till matters are settled, look like hedgehogs,with every quill raised, and firmly set, as if to forbid theapproach of any one who might wish to rub them down.  Incircumstances where an English woman would look proud, and aFrench woman _nonchalante_, an American lady looks grim; even theyoungest and the prettiest can set their lips, and knit theirbrows, and look as hard and unsocial as their grandmothers.Though not in the Yankee or New England country, we werebordering upon it sufficiently to meet in the stages and boatsmany delightful specimens of this most peculiar race.  I likethem extremely well, but I would not wish to have any businesstransactions with them, if I could avoid it, lest, to use theirown phrase, "they should be too smart for me."It is by no means rare to meet elsewhere, in this working-dayworld of our's, people who push acuteness to the verge ofhonesty, and sometimes, perhaps, a little bit beyond; but, Ibelieve, the Yankee is the only one who will be found to boastof doing so.  It is by no means easy to give a clear and justidea of a Yankee; if you hear his character from a Virginian,you will believe him a devil: if you listen to it from himself,you might fancy him a god--though a tricky one; Mercury turnedrighteous and notable.  Matthews did very well, as far as "Iexpect," "I calculate," and "I guess;" but this is only theshell; there is an immense deal within, both of sweet and bitter.In acuteness, cautiousness, industry, and perseverance, heresembles the Scotch; in habits of frugal neatness, he resemblesthe Dutch; in love of lucre he doth greatly resemble the sons ofAbraham; but in frank admission, and superlative admiration ofall his own peculiarities, he is like nothing on earth buthimself.The Quakers have been celebrated for the pertinacity with whichthey avoid giving a direct answer, but what Quaker could ever viewith a Yankee in this sort of fencing?  Nothing, in fact, canequal their skill in evading a question, excepting that withwhich they set about asking one.  I am afraid that in repeating aconversation which I overheard on board the Erie canal boat, Ishall spoil it, by forgetting some of the little delicatedoublings which delighted me--yet I wrote it down immediately.Both parties were Yankees, but strangers to each other; one ofthem having, by gentle degrees, made himself pretty wellacquaninted with the point from which every one on board hadstarted, and that for which he was bound, at last attacked hisbrother Reynard thus:-"Well, now, which way may you be travelling?""I expect this canal runs pretty nearly west.""Are you going far with it?""Well, now, I don't rightly know how many miles it may be.""I expect you'll be from New York?""Sure enough I have been at New York, often and often.""I calculate, then, 'tis not there as you stop?""Business must be minded, in stopping and in stirring.""You may say that.  Well, I look then you'll be making for theSprings?""Folks say as all the world is making for the Springs, and Iexcept a good sight of them is.""Do you calculate upon stopping long when you get to yourjourney's end?""'Tis my business must settle that, I expect?""I guess that's true, too; but you'll be for making pleasure abusiness for once, I calculate?""My business don't often lie in that line.""Then, may be, it is not the Springs as takes you this line?""The Springs is a right elegant place, I reckon.""It is your health, I calculate, as makes you break your goodrules?""My health don't trouble me much, I guess.""No?  Why that's well.  How is the markets, sir?  Are breadstuffs up?""I a'nt just capable to say.""A deal of money's made by just looking after the article at thefountain's head.""You may say that.""Do you look to be making great dealings in produce up thecountry?""Why that, I expect, is difficult to know.""I calculate you'll find the markets changeable these times?""No markets ben't very often without changing.""Why, that's right down true.  What may be your biggest articleof produce?""I calculate, generally, that's the biggest, as I makes most by.""You may say that.  But what do you chiefly call your mostparticular branch?""Why, that's what I can't justly say."And so they went on, without advancing or giving an inch, 'till Iwas weary of listening; but I left them still at it, when Istepped out to resume my station on a trunk at the bow of theboat, where I scribbled in my note-book this specimen of Yankeeconversation.The Erie canal has cut through much solid rock, and we oftenpassed between magnificent cliffs.  The little falls of theMohawk form a lovely scene; the rocks over which the river runsare most fantastic in form.  The fall continues nearly a mile,and a beautiful village, called the Little Falls, overhangs it.As many locks occur at this point, we quitted the boat, that wemight the better enjoy the scenery, which is of the widestdescription.  Several other passengers did so likewise, and I wasmuch amused by one of our Yankees, who very civilly accompaniedour party, pointing out to me the wild state of the country, andapologizing for it, by saying, that the property all roundthereabouts had been owned by an Englishman; "and you'll excuseme, ma'am, but when the English gets a spot of wild ground likethis here, they have no notions about it like us; but theEnglishman have sold it, and if you was to see it five yearshence, you would not know it again; I'll engage there will be bythat, half a score elegant factories--'tis a true shame to letsuch a privilege of water lie idle."We reached Utica at twelve o'clock the following day, prettywell fagged by the sun by day, and a crowded cabin by night;lemon-juice and iced-water (without sugar) kept us alive.  Butfor this delightful recipe, feather fans, and eau de Cologne, Ithink we should have failed altogether; the thermometer stood at90 degrees.At two, we set off in a very pleasant airy carriage for TrentonFalls, a delightful drive of fourteen miles.  These falls havebecome within the last few years only second in fame to Niagara.The West Canada Creek, which in the map shows but as a paltrystream, has found its way through three miles of rock, which, atmany points, is 150 feet high.  A forest of enormous cedars is ontheir summit; and many of that beautiful species of white cedarwhich droops its branches like the weeping-willow grow in theclefts of the rock, and in some places almost dip their darkfoliage in the torrent.  The rock is of a dark grey limestone,and often presents a wall of unbroken surface.  Near the hotel aflight of very alarming steps leads down to the bed of thestream, and on reaching it you find yourself enclosed in a deepabyss of solid rock, with no visible opening but that above yourhead.  The torrent dashes by with inconceivable rapidity; itscolour is black as night, and the dark ledge of rock on which youstand, is so treacherously level with it, that nothing warns youof danger.  Within the last three years two young people, thoughsurrounded by their friends, have stepped an inch too far, anddisappeared from among them, as if by magic, never to revisitearth again.  This broad flat ledge reached but a short distance,and then the perpendicular wall appears to stop your fartherprogress; but there is a spirit of defiance in the mind of man;he will not be stayed either by rocks or waves.  By the aid ofgunpowder a sufficient quantity of the rock has been removed toafford a fearful footing round a point, which, when doubled,discloses a world of cataracts, all leaping forward together inmost magnificent confusion.  I suffered considerably before Ireached the spot where this grand scene is visible; a chainfirmly fastened to the rock serves to hang by, as you creep alongthe giddy verge, and this enabled me to proceed so far; but herethe chain failed, and my courage with it, though the rest of theparty continued for some way farther, and reported largely ofstill increasing sublimity.  But my knees tottered, and my headswam, so while the rest crept onward, I sat down to wait theirreturn on the floor of rock which had received us on quittingthe steps.A hundred and fifty feet of bare black rock on one side, an equalheight covered with solemn cedars on the other, an unfathomedtorrent roaring between them, the fresh remembrance of theghastly legend belonging to the spot, and the idea of my childrenclinging to the dizzy path I had left, was altogether sombreenough; but I had not sat long before a tremendous burst ofthunder shook the air; the deep chasm answered from either side,again, again, and again; I thought the rock I sat upon trembled:but the whole effect was so exceedingly grand, that I had nolonger leisure to think of fear; my children immediatelyreturned, and we enjoyed together the darkening shadows cast overthe abyss, the rival clamour of the torrent and the storm, andthat delightful exaltation of the spirits which sets danger atdefiance.  A few heavy rain drops alarmed us more than all theterrors of the spot, or rather, they recalled our senses, and weretreated by the fearful steps, reaching our hotel unwetted andunharmed.  The next morning we were again early a foot; the lastnight's storm had refreshed the air, and renewed our strength.We now took a different route, and instead of descending, asbefore, walked through the dark forest along the cliff,sufficiently near its edge to catch fearful glimpses of the scenebelow.  After some time the patch began to descend, and at lengthbrought us to the Shantee, commemorated in Miss Sedgwick'sClarence.  This is by far the finest point of the falls.  Thereis a little balcony in front of the Shantee, literally hangingover the tremendous whirlpool; though frail, it makes one fancyoneself in safety, and reminded me of the feeling with which Ihave stood on one side a high gate, watching a roaring bull onthe other.  The walls of this Shantee are literally covered withautographs, and I was inclined to join the laugh against theegotistical trifling, when one of the party discovered "Trollope,England," amidst the innumerable scrawls.  The well knowncharacters were hailed with such delight, that I think I shallnever again laugh at any one for leaving their name where it ispossible a friend may find it.We returned to Utica to dinner, and found that we must eitherwait till the next day for the Rochester coach, or again submitto the packet-boat.  Our impatience induced us to prefer thelatter, not very wisely, I think, for every annoyance seemed toincrease upon us.  The Oneida and the Genesee country are bothextremely beautiful, but had we not returned by another route weshould have known little about it.  From the canal nothing isseen to advantage, and very little is seen at all.  My chiefamusement, I think, was derived from names.  One town, consistingof a whiskey store and a warehouse, is called Port Byron.  AtRome, the first name I saw over a store was Remus, doing infinitehonour, I thought, to the classic lore of his godfathers andgodmothers; but it would be endless to record all the drolleriesof this kind which we met with.  We arrived at Rochester, adistance of a hundred and forty miles, on the second morningafter leaving Utica, fully determined never to enter a canal boatagain, at least, not in America.Rochester is one of the most famous of the cities built on theJack and Bean-stalk principle.  There are many splendid edificesin wood; and certainly more houses, warehouses, factories, andsteam-engines than ever were collected together in the same spaceof time; but I was told by a fellow-traveller that the stumps ofthe forest are still to be found firmly rooted in the cellars.The fall of the Genesee is close to the town, and in the courseof a few months will, perhaps, be in the middle of it.  It is anoble sheet of water, of a hundred and sixty feet perpendicularfall; but I looked at it through the window of a factory, and asI did not like that, I was obligingly handed to the door-way of asawing-mill; in short, "the great water privilege" has been soingeniously taken advantage of, that no point can be found whereits voice and its movement are not mixed and confounded withthose of the "admirable machinery of this flourishing city."The Genesee fall is renowned as being the last and fatal leap ofthe adventurous madman, Sam Patch; he had leaped it once before,and rose to the surface of the river in perfect safety, but thelast time he was seen to falter as he took the leap, and wasnever heard of more.  It seems that he had some misgivings of hisfate, for a pet bear, which he had always taken with him on hisformer break-neck adventures, and which had constantly leapedafter him without injury, he on this occasion left behind, in thecare of a friend, to whom he bequeathed him "in case of his notreturning." We saw the bear, which is kept at the principalhotel; he is a noble creature, and more completely tame than Iever saw any animal of the species.Our journey now became wilder every step, the unbroken forestoften skirted the road for miles, and the sight of a log-hut wasan event.  Yet the road was, for the greater part of the day,good, running along a natural ridge, just wide enough for it.This ridge is a very singular elevation, and, by all the enquiryI could make, the favourite theory concerning it is, that it wasformerly the boundary of Lake Ontario, near which it passes.When this ridge ceased, the road ceased too, and for the rest ofthe way to Lockport, we were most painfully jumbled and joltedover logs and through bogs, till every joint was nearlydislocated.Lockport is beyond all comparison, the strangest looking place Iever beheld.  As fast as half a dozen trees were cut down, a_factory_ was raised up; stumps still contest the ground withpillars, and porticos are seen to struggle with rocks.  It looksas if the demon of machinery, having invaded the peaceful realmsof nature, had fixed on Lockport as the battle-ground on whichthey should strive for mastery.  The fiend insists that thestreams should go one way, though the gentle mother had ever ledtheir dancing steps another; nay, the very rocks must fall beforehim, and take what form he wills.  The battle is lost and won.Nature is fairly routed and driven from the field, and therattling, crackling, hissing, spitting demon has taken possessionof Lockport for ever.We slept there, dismally enough.  I never felt more out of humourat what the Americans call improvement; it is, in truth, as itnow stands, a most hideous place, and gladly did I leave itbehind me.Our next stage was to Lewiston; for some miles before we reachedit we were within sight of the British frontier; and we made oursalaams.The monument of the brave General Brock stands on an elevatedpoint near Queenstown, and is visible at a great distance.We breakfasted at Lewiston, but felt every cup of coffee as asin, so impatient were we, as we approached the end of our longpilgrimage, to reach the shrine, which nature seems to haveplaced at such a distance from her worshippers on purpose to trythe strength of their devotion.A few miles more would bring us to the high altar, but first wehad to cross the ferry, for we were determined upon taking ourfirst view from British ground.  The Niagara river is very lovelyhere; the banks are bold, rugged, and richly coloured, both byrocks and woods; and the stream itself is bright, clear, andunspeakably green.In crossing the ferry a fellow-passenger made many enquiries ofthe young boatman respecting the battle of Queenstown; he was buta lad, and could remember little about it, but he was a Britishlad, and his answers smacked strongly of his loyal Britishfeeling.  Among other things, the questioner asked if manyAmerican citizens had not been thrown from the heights into theriver."Why, yes, there was a good many of them; but it was right toshow them there was water between us, and you know it might helpto keep the rest of them from coming to trouble us on our ownground."This phrase, "our own ground," gave interest to every mile, or Ibelieve I should have shut my eyes, and tried to sleep, that Imight annihilate what remained of time and space between me andNiagara.But I was delighted to see British oaks, and British roofs, andBritish boys and girls.  These latter, as if to impress upon usthat they were not citizens, made bows and courtseys as wepassed, and this little touch of long unknown civility producedgreat effect.  "See these dear children, mamma! do they not lookEnglish? how I love them!" was the exclamation it produced.CHAPTER 33Niagara--Arrival at Forsythes--First sight of the Falls--Goat Island--The Rapids--Buffalo--Lake Erie--Canandaigna--Stage-coach adventuresAt length we reached Niagara.  It was the brightest day that Junecould give; and almost any day would have seemed bright thatbrought me to the object, which for years, I had languished tolook upon.We did not hear the sound of the Falls till very near the hotel,which overhangs them; as you enter the door you see behind thehall an open space surrounded by galleries, one above another,and in an instant you feel that from thence the wonder isvisible.I trembled like a fool, and my girls clung to me, trembling too,I believe, but with faces beaming with delight.  We encountered awaiter who had a sympathy of some sort with us, for he would notlet us run through the hall to the first gallery, but ushered usup stairs, and another instant placed us where, at one glance, Isaw all I had wished for, hoped for, dreamed of.It is not for me to attempt a description of Niagara; I feel Ihave no powers for it.After one long, stedfast gaze, we quitted the gallery that wemight approach still nearer, and in leaving the house had thegood fortune to meet an English gentleman, (The accomplishedauthor of "Cyril Thornton.") who had been introduced to us at NewYork; he had preceded us by a few days, and knew exactly how andwhere to lead us.  If any man living can describe the scene welooked upon it is himself, and I trust he will do it.  As formyself, I can only say, that wonder, terror, and delightcompletely overwhelmed me.  I wept with a strange mixture ofpleasure and of pain, and certainly was, for some time, tooviolently affected in the _physique_ to be capable of muchpleasure; but when this emotion of the senses subsided, and I hadrecovered some degree of composure, my enjoyment was very greatindeed.To say that I was not disappointed is but a weak expression toconvey the surprise and astonishment which this long dreamed ofscene produced.  It has to me something beyond its vastness;there is a shadowy mystery hangs about it which neither the eyenor even the imagination can penetrate; but I dare not dwell onthis, it is a dangerous subject, and any attempt to describe thesensations produced must lead direct to nonsense.Exactly at the Fall, it is the Fall and nothing else you have tolook upon; there are not, as at Trenton, mighty rocks andtowering forests, there is only the waterfall; but it is the fallof an ocean, and were Pelion piled on Ossa on either side of it,we could not look at them.The noise is greatly less than I expected; one can hear withperfect distinctness everything said in an ordinary tone, whenquite close to the cataract.  The cause of this, I imagine to be,that it does not fall immediately among rocks, like the farnoisier Potomac, but direct and unbroken, save by its ownrebound.  The colour of the water, before this rebound hides itin foam and mist, is of the brightest and most delicate green;the violence of the impulse sends it far over the precipicebefore it falls, and the effect of the ever varying light throughits transparency is, I think, the loveliest thing I ever lookedupon.We descended to the edge of the gulf which received the torrent,and thence looked at the horse-shoe fall in profile; it seemslike awful daring to stand close beside it, and raise one's eyesto its immensity.  I think the point the most utterlyinconceivable to those who have not seen it, is the centre of thehorse-shoe.  The force of the torrent converges there, and as theheavy mass pours in, twisted, wreathed, and curled together, itgives an idea of irresistible power, such as no other object everconveyed to me.The following anecdote, which I had from good authority, may givesome notion of this mighty power.After the last American war, three of our ships stationed on LakeErie were declared unfit for service, and condemned.  Some oftheir officers obtained permission to send them over NiagaraFalls.  The first was torn to shivers by the rapids, and wentover in fragments; the second filled with water before shereached the fall; but the third, which was in better condition,took the leap gallantly, and retained her form till it was hid inthe cloud of mist below.  A reward of ten dollars was offered forthe largest fragment of wood that should be found from eitherwreck, five for the second, and so on.  One morsel only was everseen, and that about a foot in length, was mashed as by a vice,and its edges notched like the teeth of a saw.  What had becomeof the immense quantity of wood which had been precipitated? Whatunknown whirlpool had engulphed it, so that, contrary to the verylaws of nature, no vestige of the floating material could findits way to the surface?Beyond the horse-shoe is Goat Island, and beyond Goat Island theAmerican fall, bold, straight, and chafed to snowy whiteness bythe rocks which meet it; but it does not approach, in sublimityor awful beauty, to the wondrous crescent on the other shore.There, the form of the mighty cauldron, into which the delugepoors, the hundred silvery torrents congregating round its verge,the smooth and solemn movement with which it rolls its massivevolume over the rock, the liquid emerald of its long unbrokenwaters, the fantastic wreaths which spring to meet it, and then,the shadowy mist that veils the horrors of its crash below,constitute a scene almost too enormous in its features for man tolook upon.  "Angels might tremble as they gazed;" and I shoulddeem the nerves obtuse, rather than strong, which did not quailat the first sight of this stupendous cataract.Minute local particulars can be of no interest to those who havenot felt their influence for pleasure or for pain.  I will nottell of giddy stairs which scale the very edge of the torrent,nor of beetling slabs of table rock, broken and breaking, onwhich, shudder as you may, you must take your stand or lose yourreputation as a tourist.  All these feats were performed againand again even on the first day of our arrival, and most earthlyweary was I when the day was done, though I would not lose theremembrance of it to purchase the addition of many soft andsilken ones to my existence.By four o'clock the next morning I was again at the littleshantee, close to the horse-shoe fall, which seems reared inwater rather than in air, and took an early shower-bath of spray.Much is concealed at this early hour by the heavy vapour, butthere was a charm in the very obscurity; and every moment, as thelight increased, cloud after cloud rolled off, till the vastwonder was again before me.It is in the afternoon that the rainbow is visible from theBritish side; and it is a lovely feature in the mighty landscape.The gay arch springs from fall to fall, a fairy bridge.After breakfast we crossed to the American side, and exploredGoat Island.  The passage across the Niagara, directly in face ofthe falls, is one of the most delightful little voyagesimaginable; the boat crosses marvellously near them, and withinreach of a light shower of spray.  Real safety and apparentdanger have each their share in the pleasure felt.  The river ishere two hundred feet deep.  The passage up the rock brings youclose upon the American cataract; it is a vast sheet, and has allthe sublimity that height and width, and uproar can give; but ithas none of the magic of its rival about it.  Goat Island has, atall points, a fine view of the rapids; the furious velocity withwhich they rush onward to the abyss is terrific; and the throwinga bridge across them was a work of noble daring.Below the falls, the river runs between lofty rocks, crowned withunbroken forests; this scene forms a striking contrast to thelevel shores above the cataract.  It appears as if the level ofthe river had been broken up by some volcanic force.  The Niagaraflows out of Lake Erie, a broad, deep river; but for severalmiles its course is tranquil, and its shores perfectly level.  Bydegrees its bed begins to sink, and the glassy smoothness isdisturbed by a slight ripple.  The inverted trees, that beforelay so softly still upon its bosom, become twisted and torturedtill they lose their form, and seem madly to mix in the tumultthat destroys them.  The current becomes more rapid at everystep, till rock after rock has chafed the stream to fury, makingthe green one white.  This lasts for a mile, and then down sinkthe rocks at once, one hundred and fifty feet, and the enormousflood falls after them.  God said, let there be a cataract, andit was so.  When the river has reached its new level, theprecipice on either side shows a terrific chasm of solid rock;some beautiful plants are clinging to its sides, and oak, ash,and cedar, in many places, clothe their terrors with richfoliage.This violent transition from level shores to a deep ravine, seemsto indicate some great convulsion as its cause, and when I heardof a burning spring close by, I fancied the volcanic power stillat work, and that the wonders of the region might yet increase.We passed four delightful days of excitement and fatigue; wedrenched ourselves in spray; we cut our feet on the rocks; weblistered our faces in the sun; we looked up the cataract, anddown the cataract; we perched ourselves on every pinnacle wecould find; we dipped our fingers in the flood at a few yards'distance from its thundering fall; in short, we strove to fill asmany niches of memory with Niagara as possible; and I think theimages will be within the power of recall for ever.We met many groups of tourists in our walks, chiefly American,but they were, or we fancied they were, but little observant ofthe wonders around them.One day we were seated on a point of the cliff, near the ferry,which commands a view of both the Falls.  This, by the way, isconsidered as the finest general view of the scene.  One of ourparty was employed in attempting to sketch, what, however, Ibelieve it is impossible for any pencil to convey an idea of tothose who have not seen it.  We had borrowed two or three chairsfrom a neighbouring cottage, and amongst us had gathered aquantity of boughs which, with the aid of shawls and parasols, wehad contrived to weave into a shelter from the midday sun, sothat altogether I have no doubt we looked very cool andcomfortable.A large party who had crossed from the American side, wound upthe steep ascent from the place where the boat had left them; indoing so their backs were turned to the cataracts, and as theyapproached the summit, our party was the principal object beforethem.  They all stood perfectly still to look at us.  This firstexamination was performed at the distance of about a dozen yardfrom the spot we occupied, and lasted about five minutes, bywhich time they had recovered breath, and acquired courage.  Theythen advanced in a body, and one or two of them began to examine(wrong side upwards) the work of the sketcher, in doing whichthey stood precisely between him and his object; but of this Ithink it is very probable they were not aware.  Some among themnext began to question us as to how long we had been at theFalls; whether there were much company; if we were not from theold country, and the like.  In return we learnt that they werejust arrived; yet not one of them (there were eight) ever turnedthe head, even for a moment, to look at the most stupendousspectacle that nature has to show.The company at the hotel changed almost every day.  Many partiesarrived in the morning, walked to the falls; returned to thehotel to dinner, and departed by the coach immediately after it.Many groups were indescribably whimsical, both in appearance andmanner.  Now and then a first-rate dandy shot in among us, like afalling star.On one occasion, when we were in the beautiful gallery, at theback of the hotel, which overlooks the horse-shoe fall, we sawthe booted leg of one of this graceful race protruded from thewindow which commands the view, while his person was thrown backin his chair, and his head enveloped in a cloud of tobacco smoke.I have repeatedly remarked, when it has happened to me to meetany ultra fine men among the wilder and more imposing scenes ofour own land, that they throw off, in a great degree, theirairs, and their "townliness," as some one cleverly calls these_simagrees_, as if ashamed to "play their fantastic tricks"before the god of nature, when so forcibly reminded of hispresence; and more than once on these occasions I have beensurprised to find how much intellect lurked behind the inanemask of fashion.  But in America the effect of fine sceneryupon this class of persons is different, for it is exactlywhen amongst it, that the most strenuous efforts at elegant_nonchalance_ are perceptible among the young exquisites of thewestern world.  It is true that they have little leisure for thedisplay of grace in the daily routine of commercial activity inwhich their lives are passed, and this certainly offers asatisfactory explanation of the fact above stated.Fortunately for our enjoyment, the solemn character of the scenewas but little broken in upon by these gentry.  Every one whocomes to Forsythe's Hotel (except Mrs. Bogle Corbet), walks tothe shantee, writes their name in a book which is kept there,and, for the most part, descends by the spiral staircase whichleads from the little platform before it, to the rocks below.Here they find another shantee, but a few yards from the entranceof that wondrous cavern which is formed by the falling flood onone side, and by the mighty rock over which it pours, on theother.  To this frail shelter from the wild uproar, and theblinding spray, nearly all the touring gentlemen, and even manyof the pretty ladies, find their way.  But here I often saw theirnoble daring fail, and have watched them dripping and draggledturn again to the sheltering stairs, leaving us in fullpossession of the awful scene we so dearly loved to gaze upon.How utterly futile must every attempt be to describe the spot!How vain every effort to convey an idea of the sensations itproduces!  Why is it so exquisite a pleasure to stand for hoursdrenched in spray, stunned by the ceaseless roar, trembling fromthe concussion that shakes the very rock you cling to, andbreathing painfully in the moist atmosphere that seems to haveless of air than water in it?  Yet pleasure it is, and I almostthink the greatest I ever enjoyed.  We more than once approachedthe entrance to this appalling cavern, but I never fairly enteredit, though two or three of my party did.  I lost my breathentirely; and the pain at my chest was so severe, that not all mycuriosity could enable me to endure it.What was that cavern of the winds, of which we heard of old,compared to this?  A mightier spirit than Aeolus reigns here.Nor was this spot of dread and danger the only one in which wefound ourselves alone.  The path taken by "the company" to theshantee, which contained the "book of names" was always the same;this wound down the steep bank from the gate of the hotel garden,and was rendered tolerably easy by its repeated doublings; but itwas by no means the best calculated to manage to advantage thepleasure of the stranger in his approach to the spot.  Allothers, however, seemed left for us alone.During our stay we saw the commencement of another staircase,intended to rival in attraction that at present in use; it is buta few yards from it, and can in no way, I think, contribute tothe convenience of the descent.  The erection of the centralshaft of this spiral stair was a most tremendous operation, andmade me sick and giddy as I watched it.  After it had been madefast at the bottom, the carpenters swung themselves off therocks, by the means of ropes, to the beams which traversed it;and as they sat across them, in the midst of the spray and theuproar, I thought I had never seen life periled so wantonly.  Butthe work proceeded without accident, and was nearly finishedbefore we left the hotel.It was a sort of pang to take what we knew must be our last lookat Niagara; but "we had to do it," as the Americans say, and leftit on the 10th June, for Buffalo.The drive along the river, above the Falls, is as beautiful as aclear stream of a mile in width can make it; and the roadcontinues close to it till you reach the ferry at Black Rock.We welcomed, almost with a shout, the British colours which wesaw, for the first time, on Commodore Barrie's pretty sloop, the_Bull Dog_, which we passed as it was towing up the river to LakeErie, the commodore being about to make a tour of the lakes.At Black Rock we crossed again into the United States, and a fewmiles of horrible jolting brought us to Buffalo.Of all the thousand and one towns I saw in America, I thinkBuffalo is the queerest looking; it is not quite so wild asLockport, but all the buildings have the appearance of havingbeen run up in a hurry, though every thing has an air of greatpretension; there are porticos, columns, domes, and colonnades,but all in wood.  Every body tells you there, as in all theirother new-born towns, and every body believes, that theirimprovement, and their progression, are more rapid, morewonderful, than the earth ever before witnessed; while to me,the only wonder is, how so many thousands, nay millions ofpersons, can be found, in the nineteenth century, who can becontent so to live.  Surely this country may be said to spreadrather than to rise.The Eagle Hotel, an immense wooden fabric, has all thepretension of a splendid establishment, but its monstrouscorridors, low ceilings, and intricate chambers, gave me thefeeling of a catacomb rather than a house.  We arrived afterthe _table d'hote_ tea-drinking was over, and supped comfortablyenough with a gentleman, who accompanied us from the Falls: butthe next morning we breakfasted in a long, low, narrow room,with a hundred persons, and any thing less like comfort canhardly be imagined.What can induce so many intellectual citizens to prefer theselong, silent tables, scantily covered with morsels of fried ham,salt fish and liver, to a comfortable loaf of bread with theirwives and children at home?  How greatly should I prefer eatingmy daily meals with my family, in an Indian wig-wam, to boardingat a _table d'hote_ in these capacious hotels; the custom,however, seems universal through the country, at least we havemet it, without a shadow of variation as to its general features,from New Orleans to Buffalo.Lake Erie has no beauty to my eyes; it is not the sea, and it isnot the river, nor has it the beautiful scenery generally foundround smaller lakes.  The only interest its unmeaning expansegave me, arose from remembering that its waters, there so tameand tranquil, were destined to leap the gulf of Niagara.  Adreadful road, through forests only beginning to be felled,brought us to Avon; it is a straggling, ugly little place, andnot any of their "Romes, Carthages, Ithacas, or Athens," everprovoked me by their name so much.  This Avon flows sweetly withnothing but whiskey and tobacco juice.The next day's journey was much more interesting, for it showedus the lake of Canandaigua.  It is about eighteen miles long, butnarrow enough to bring the opposite shore, clothed with richfoliage, near to the eye; the back-ground is a ridge ofmountains.  Perhaps the state of the atmosphere lent an unusualcharm to the scene; one of those sudden thunderstorms, so rapidin approach, and so sombre in colouring, that they change thewhole aspect of things in a moment, rose over the mountains andpassed across the lake while we looked upon it.  Another featurein the scene gave a living, but most sad interest to it.  Aglaring wooden hotel, as fine as paint and porticos can make it,overhangs the lake; beside it stands a shed for cattle.  To thisshed, and close by the white man's mushroom palace, two Indianshad crept to seek a shelter from the storm.  The one was an agedman, whose venerable head in attitude and expression indicatedthe profoundest melancholy: the other was a youth, and in hisdeep-set eye there was a quiet sadness more touching still.There they stood, the native rightful lords of the fair land,looking out upon the lovely lake which yet bore the name theirfathers had given it, watching the threatening storm that broodedthere; a more fearful one had already burst over them.Though I have mentioned the lake first, the little town ofCanandaigua precedes it, in returning from the West.  It is aspretty a village as ever man contrived to build.  Every house issurrounded by an ample garden, and at that flowery season theywere half buried in roses.It is true these houses are of wood, but they are so neatlypainted, in such perfect repair, and show so well within theirleafy setting, that it is impossible not to admire them.Forty-six miles farther is Geneva, beautifully situated on SenecaLake.  This, too, is a lovely sheet of water, and I think thetown may rival its European namesake in beauty.We slept at Auburn, celebrated for its prison, where thehighly-approved system of American discipline originated.  Inthis part of the country there is no want of churches; everylittle village has its wooden temple, and many of them too; thatthe Methodists and Presbyterians may not clash.We passed through an Indian reserve, and the untouched forestsagain hung close upon the road.  Repeated groups of Indianspassed us, and we remarked that they were much cleaner and betterdressed than those we had met wandering far from their homes.The blankets which they use so gracefully as mantles were aswhite as snow.We took advantage of the loss of a horse's shoe, to leave thecoach, and approach a large party of them, consisting of men,women, and children, who were regaling themselves with I know notwhat, but milk made a part of the repast.  They could not talk tous, but they received us with smiles, and seemed to understandwhen we asked if they had mocassins to sell, for they shook theirsable locks, and answered "no."  A beautiful grove of butternuttrees was pointed out to us, as the spot where the chiefs of thesix nations used to hold their senate; our informer told me thathe had been present at several of their meetings, and though heknew but little of their language, the power of their eloquencewas evident from the great effect it produced among themselves.Towards the end of this day, we encountered an adventure whichrevived our doubts whether the invading white men, in chasingthe poor Indians from their forests, have done much towardscivilizing the land.  For myself, I almost prefer the indigenousmanner to the exotic.The coach stopped to take in "a lady" at Vernon; she entered, andcompletely filled the last vacant inch of our vehicle; for "wewere eight" before.But no sooner was she seated, than her _beau_ came forward with amost enormous wooden best-bonnet box.  He paused for a while tomeditate the possibilities--raised it, as if to place it on ourlaps--sunk it, as if to put it beneath our feet.  Both alikeappeared impossible; when, in true Yankee style he addressed oneof our party with.  If you'll just step out a minute, I guessI'll find room for it.""Perhaps so.  But how shall I find room for myself afterwards?"This was uttered in European accents, and in an instant half adozen whiskey drinkers stepped from before the whiskey store, andtook the part of the _beau_."That's because you'll be English travellers I expect, but wehave travelled in better countries than Europe--we have travelledin America--and the box will go, I calculate."We remonstrated on the evident injustice of the proceeding, and Iventured to say, that as we had none of us any luggage in thecarriage, because the space was so very small, I thought a chancepassenger could have no right so greatly to incommode us."Right!--there they go--that's just their way--that will do inEurope, may be; it sounds just like English tyranny, now don'tit? but it won't do here."  And thereupon he began thrusting inthe wooden box against our legs, with all his strength."No law, sir, can permit such conduct as this.""Law!" exclaimed a gentleman very particularly drunk, "we makesour own laws, and governs our own selves.""Law!" echoed another gentleman of Vernon, "this is a freecountry, _we have no laws here_, and we don't want no foreignpower to tyrannize over us."295I give the words exactly.  It is, however, but fair to state,that the party had evidently been drinking more than an usualportion of whiskey, but, perhaps, in whiskey, as in wine, truthmay come to light.  At any rate the people of the WesternParadise follow the Gentiles in this, that they are a law untothemselves.During the contest, the coachman sat upon the box without sayinga word, but seemed greatly to enjoy the joke; the question of thebox, however, was finally decided in our favour by the nature ofthe human material, which cannot be compressed beyond a certaindegree.For the great part of this day we had the good fortune to have agentleman and his daughter for our fellow-travellers, who wereextremely intelligent and agreeable; but I nearly got myself intoa scrape by venturing to remark upon a phrase used by thegentleman, and which had met me at every corner from the time Ifirst entered the country.  We had been talking of pictures, andI had endeavoured to adhere to the rule I had laid down formyself, of saying very little, where I could say nothingagreeable.  At length he named an American artist, with whoseworks I was very familiar, and after having declared him equal toLawrence (judging by his portrait of West, now at New York), headded, "and what is more, madam, he is perfectly _self-taught_."I prudently took a few moments before I answered; for theequalling our immortal Lawrence to a most vile dauber stuck in mythroat; I could not say Amen; so for some time I said nothing;but, at last, I remarked on the frequency with which I had heardthis phrase of _self-taught_ used, not as an apology, but aspositive praise."Well, madam, can there be a higher praise?""Certainly not, if spoken of the individual merits of a person,without the means of instruction, but I do not understand it whenapplied as praise to his works.""Not understand it, madam?  Is it not attributing genius to theauthor, and what is teaching compared to that?"296I do not wish to repeat all my own _bons mots_ in praise ofstudy, and on the disadvantages of profound ignorance, but Iwould, willingly, if I could, give an idea of the mixedindignation and contempt expressed by our companion at the ideathat study was necessary to the formation of taste, and to thedevelopment of genius.  At last, however, he closed thediscussion thus,--"There is no use in disputing a point that isalready settled, madam; the best judges declare that Mr. H--g'sportraits are equal to that of Lawrence.""Who is it who has passed this judgement, sir?""The men of taste of America, madam."I then asked him, if he thought it was going to rain?The stages do not appear to have any regular stations at whichto stop for breakfast, dinner, and supper.  These necessaryinterludes, therefore, being generally _impromptu_, wereabominably bad.  We were amused by the patient manner in whichour American fellow-travellers ate whatever was set before them,without uttering a word of complaint, or making any effort toimprove it, but no sooner reseated in the stage, than they begantheir complaints--"twas a shame"--"twas a robbery"--"twaspoisoning folks"--and the like.  I, at last, asked the reason ofthis, and why they did not remonstrate?  "Because, madam, noAmerican gentleman or lady that keeps an inn won't bear to befound fault with."We reached Utica very late and very weary; but the delights of agood hotel and perfect civility sent us in good humour to bed,and we arose sufficiently refreshed to enjoy a day's journeythrough some of the loveliest scenery in the world.Who is it that says America is not picturesque?  I forget; butsurely he never travelled from Utica to Albany.  I really cannotconceive that any country can furnish a drive of ninety-six milesmore beautiful, or more varied in its beauty.  The road followsthe Mohawk River, which flows through scenes changing fromfields, waving with plenty, to rocks and woods; gentle slopes,covered with cattle, are divided from each other by precipices500 feet high.  Around the little falls there is a character ofbeauty as singular as it is striking.  Here, as I observed ofmany other American rivers, the stream appears to run in a muchnarrower channel than it once occupied, and the space which itseems formerly to have filled, is now covered with bright greenherbage, save that, at intervals, large masses of rock riseabruptly from the level turf; these are crowned with all suchtrees as love the scanty diet which a rock affords.  Dwarf oak,cedars, and the mountain ash, are grouped in a hundred differentways among them; each clump you look upon is lovelier than itsneighbour; I never saw so sweetly wild a spot.I was surprised to hear a fellow-traveller say, as we passed apoint of peculiar beauty, "all this neighbourhood belongs, or didbelong, to Mr. Edward Ellice, an English Member of Parliament,but he has sold a deal of it, and now, madam, you may see as itbegins to improve;" and he pointed to a great wooden edifice,where, on the white paint, "Cash for Rags," in letters three feethigh, might be seen.I then remembered that it was near this spot that my Yankeefriend had made his complaint against English indifference to"water privilege."  He did not name Mr. Edward Ellice, butdoubtless he was the "English, as never thought of improvement."I have often confessed my conscious incapacity for description,but I must repeat it here to apologize for my passing so dullythrough this matchless valley of the Mohawk.  I would that someBritish artist, strong in youthful daring, would take my word forit, and pass over, for a summer pilgrimage through the State ofNew York.  In very earnest, he would wisely, for I question ifthe world could furnish within the same space, and with equalfacility of access, so many subjects for his pencil.  Mountains,forests, rocks, lakes, rivers, cataracts, all in perfection.  Buthe must be bold as a lion in colouring, or he will make nothingof it.  There is a clearness of atmosphere, a strength of _chiarooscuro_, a massiveness in the foliage, and a brilliance ofcontrast, that must make a colourist of any one who has an eye.He must have courage to dip his pencil in shadows black as night,and light that might blind an eagle.  As I presume my youngartist to be an enthusiast, he must first go direct to Niagara,or even in the Mohawk valley his pinioned wing may droop.  If hisfever run very high, he may slake his thirst at Trenton, andwhile there, he will not dream of any thing beyond it.  Should myadvice be taken, I will ask the young adventurer on his return(when he shall have made a prodigious quantity of money by myhint), to reward me by two sketches.  One shall be the lake ofCanandaigua; the other the Indians' Senate Grove of Butternuts.During our journey, I forget on which day of it, a particularspot in the forest, at some distance from the road, was pointedout to us as the scene of a true, but very romantic story.During the great and the terrible French revolution (1792), ayoung nobleman escaped from the scene of horror, having withdifficulty saved his head, and without the possibility of savingany thing else.  He arrived at New York nearly destitute; andafter passing his life, not only in splendour, but in thesplendour of the court of France, he found himself jostled by thebusy population of the New World, without a dollar between himand starvation.  In such a situation one might almost sigh forthe guillotine.  The young noble strove to labour; but who wouldpurchase the trembling efforts of his white hands, while thesturdy strength of many a black Hercules was in the market?  Heabandoned the vain attempt to sustain himself by the aid of hisfellow-men, and determined to seek a refuge in the forest.  A fewshillings only remained to him; he purchased an axe, and reachedthe Oneida territory.  He felled a few of the slenderest trees,and made himself a shelter that Robinson Crusoe would havelaughed at, for it did not keep out the rain.  Want of food,exposure to the weather, and unwonted toil, produced the naturalresult; the unfortunate young man fell sick, and stretched uponthe reeking earth, stifled, rather than sheltered, by thewithering boughs which hung over him; he lay parched with thirst,and shivering in ague, with the one last earthly hope, that eachheavy moment would prove the last.Near to the spot which he had chosen for his miserable rest, buttotally concealed from it by the thick forest, was the laststraggling wigwam of an Indian village.  It is not known how manydays the unhappy man had lain without food, but he was quiteinsensible when a young squaw, whom chance had brought from thiswigwam to his hut, entered, and found him alive, but totallyinsensible.  The heart of woman is, I believe, pretty much thesame every where; the young girl paused not to think whether hewere white or red, but her fleet feet rested not till she hadbrought milk, rum, and blankets, and when the sufferer recoveredhis senses, his head was supported on her lap, while, with thegentle tenderness of a mother, she found means to make himswallow the restoratives she had brought.No black eyes in the world, be they of France, Italy, or evenof Spain, can speak more plainly of kindness, than the largedeep-set orbs of a squaw; this is a language that all nationscan understand, and the poor Frenchman read most clearly, inthe anxious glance of his gentle nurse, that he should not dieforsaken.So far the story is romantic enough, and what follows is hardlyless so.  The squaw found means to introduce her white friend toher tribe; he was adopted as their brother, speedily acquiredtheir language, and assumed their dress and manner of life.  Hisgratitude to his preserver soon ripened into love, and if thechronicle spoke true, the French noble and the American savagewere more than passing happy as man and wife, and it was not tillhe saw himself the father of many thriving children that theexile began to feel a wish of rising again from savage tocivilized existence.My historian did not explain what his project was in visitingNew York, but he did so in the habit of an Indian, and learntenough of the restored tranquillity of his country to give himhope that some of the broad lands he had left there might berestored to him.I have made my story already too long, and must not linger uponit farther than to say that his hopes were fulfilled, and that,of a large and flourishing family, some are settled in France,and some remain in America, (one of these, I understood, was alawyer at New York), while the hero and the heroine of the talecontinue to inhabit the Oneida country, not in a wigwam, however,but in a good house, in a beautiful situation, with all thecomforts of civilized life around them.Such was the narrative we listened to, from a stage coachcompanion; and it appears to me sufficiently interesting torepeat, though I have no better authority to quote for itstruth, than the assertion of this unknown traveller.CHAPTER 34Return to New York--ConclusionThe comfortable Adelphi Hotel again received us at Albany, on the14th of June, and we decided upon passing the following daythere, both to see the place, and to recruit our strength, whichwe began to feel we had taxed severely by a very fatiguingjourney, in most oppressively hot weather.  It would have beendifficult to find a better station for repose; the rooms werelarge and airy, and ice was furnished in most profuse abundance.But notwithstanding the manifold advantages of this excellenthotel, I was surprised at the un-English arrangement communicatedto me by two ladies with whom we made a speaking acquaintance,by which it appeared that they made it their permanent home.These ladies were a mother and daughter; the daughter was anextremely pretty young married woman, with two little children.Where the husbands were, or whether they were dead or alive, Iknow not; but they told me they had been _boarding_ there abovea year. They breakfasted, dined, and supped at the _tabled'hote_, with from twenty to a hundred people, as accident mightdecide; dressed very smart, played on the piano, in the publicsitting-room, and assured me they were particularly comfortableand well accommodated.  What a life!Some parts of the town are very handsome; the Town Hall, theChamber of Representatives, and some other public buildings,stand well on a hill that overlooks the Hudson, with ampleenclosures of grass and trees around them.Many of the shops are large, and showily set out.  I was amusedby a national trait which met me at one of them.  I entered it topurchase some _eau de Cologne_, but finding what was offered tome extremely bad, and very cheap, I asked if they had none at ahigher price, and better."You are a stranger, I guess," was the answer.  "The Yankees wantlow price, that's all; they don't stand so much for goodness asthe English."Nothing could be more beautiful than our passage down the Hudsonon the following day, as I thought of some of my friends inEngland, dear lovers of the picturesque, I could not but exclaim,      "Que je vous plains! que je vous plains!       Vous ne la verrez pas."Not even a moving panoramic view, gliding before their eyes foran hour together, in all the scenic splendour of Drury Lane, orCovent Garden, could give them an idea of it.  They could onlysee one side at a time.  The change, the contrast, the ceaselessvariety of beauty, as you skim from side to side, the liquidsmoothness of the broad mirror that reflects the scene, and mostof all, the clear bright air through which you look at it; allthis can only be seen and believed by crossing the Atlantic.As we approached New York the burning heat of the day relaxed,and the long shadows of evening fell coolly on the beautifulvillas we passed.  I really can conceive nothing more exquisitelylovely than this approach to the city.  The magnificent boldnessof the Jersey shore on the one side, and the luxurious softnessof the shady lawns on the other, with the vast silvery streamthat flows between them, altogether form a picture which may wellexcuse a traveller for saying, once and again, that the Hudsonriver can be surpassed in beauty by none on the outside ofParadise.It was nearly dark when we reached the city, and it was withgreat satisfaction that we found our comfortable apartments inHudson Street unoccupied; and our pretty, kind (Irish) hostesswilling to receive us again.  We passed another fortnight there;and again we enjoyed the elegant hospitality of New York, thoughnow it was offered from beneath the shade of their beautifulvillas.  In truth, were all America like this fair city, and all,no, only a small proportion of its population like the friends weleft there, I should say, that the land was the fairest in theworld.But the time was come to bid it adieu!  The important business ofsecuring our homeward passage was to be performed.  One must knowwhat it is to cross the ocean before the immense importance ofall the little details of accommodation can be understood.  Theanxious first look: into the face of the captain, to ascertain ifhe be gentle or rough; another, scarcely less important, in thatof the steward, generally a sable one, but not the lessexpressive; the accurate, but rapid glance of measurement thrownround the little state-rooms; another at the good or badarrangement of the stair-case, by which you are to stumble up andstumble down, from cabin to deck, and from deck to cabin; allthis, they only can understand who have felt it.  At length,however, this interesting affair was settled, and most happily.The appearance promised well, and the performance bettered it.We hastened to pack up our "trumpery," as Captain Mirvenunkindly calls the paraphernalia of the ladies, and among therest, my six hundred pages of griffonage.  There is enough of it,yet I must add a few more lines.I suspect that what I have written will make it evident that I donot like America.  Now, as it happens that I met with individualsthere whom I love and admire, far beyond the love and admirationof ordinary acquaintance, and as I declare the country to be fairto the eye, and most richly teeming with the gifts of plenty, Iam led to ask myself why it is that I do not like it.  I wouldwillingly know myself, and confess to others, why it is thatneither its beauty nor its abundance can suffice to neutralize,or greatly soften, the distaste which the aggregate of myrecollections has left upon my mind.I remember hearing it said, many years ago, when the advantagesand disadvantages of a particular residence were being discussed,that it was the "who?" and not the "where?" that made thedifference between the pleasant or unpleasant residence.  Thetruth of the observation struck me forcibly when I heard it; andit has been recalled to my mind since, by the constantlyrecurring evidence of its justness.  In applying this to America,I speak not of my friends, nor of my friends' friends.  The smallpatrician band is a race apart; they live with each other, andfor each other; mix wondrously little with the high matters ofstate, which they seem to leave rather supinely to their tailorsand tinkers, and are no more to be taken as a sample of theAmerican people, than the head of Lord Byron as a sample of theheads of the British peerage.  I speak not of these, but of thepopulation generally, as seen in town and country, among the richand the poor, in the slave states, and the free states.  I do notlike them.  I do not like their principles, I do not like theirmanners, I do not like their opinions.Both as a woman, and as a stranger, it might be unseemly for meto say that I do not like their government, and therefore I willnot say so.  That it is one which pleases themselves is mostcertain, and this is considerably more important than pleasingall the travelling old ladies in the world.  I entered thecountry at New Orleans, remained for more than two years west ofthe Alleghanies, and passed another year among the Atlanticcities, and the country around them.  I conversed during thistime with citizens of all orders and degrees, and I never heardfrom any one a single disparaging word against their government.It is not, therefore, surprising, that when the people of thatcountry hear strangers questioning the wisdom of theirinstitutions, and expressing disapprobation at some of theireffects, they should set it down either to an incapacityof judging, or a malicious feeling of envy and ill-will."How can any one in their senses doubt the excellence of a agovernment which we have tried for half a century, and loved thebetter the longer we have known it."  Such is the natural enquiryof every American when the excellence of their government isdoubted; and I am inclined to answer, that no one in theirsenses, who has visited the country, and known the people, candoubt its fitness for them, such as they now are, or its utterunfitness for any other people..Whether the government has made the people what they are, orwhether the people have made the government what it is, to suitthemselves, I know not; but if the latter, they have shown aconsummation of wisdom which the assembled world may look uponand admire.It is a matter of historical notoriety that the original stock ofthe white population now inhabiting the United States, werepersons who had banished themselves, or were banished from themother country.  The land they found was favourable to theirincrease and prosperity; the colony grew and flourished.  Yearsrolled on, and the children, the grand-children, and the greatgrand-children of the first settlers, replenished the land, andfound it flowing with milk and honey.  That they should wish tokeep this milk and honey to themselves, is not very surprising.What did the mother country do for them?  She sent them out gayand gallant officers to guard their frontier; the which theythought they could guard as well themselves; and then she taxedtheir tea.  Now, this was disagreeable; and to atone for it, thedistant colony had no great share in her mother's grace andglory.  It was not from among them that her high and mighty werechosen; the rays which emanated from that bright sun of honour,the British throne, reached them but feebly.  They knew not, theycared not, for her kings nor her heroes; their thriftiest traderwas their noblest man; the holy seats of learning were but thecradles of superstition; the splendour of the aristocracy, but aleech that drew their "golden blood."  The wealth, the learning,the glory of Britain, was to them nothing; the having their ownway every thing.Can any blame their wish to obtain it?  Can any lament that theysucceeded?And now the day was their own, what should they do next?  Theirelders drew together, and said, "Let us make a government thatshall suit us all; let it be rude, and rough, and noisy; let itnot affect either dignity, glory, or splendour; let it interferewith no man's will, nor meddle with any man's business; let ushave neither tithes nor taxes, game laws, nor poor laws; letevery man have a hand in making the laws, and no man be troubledabout keeping them; let not our magistrates wear purple, nor ourjudges ermine; if a man grow rich, let us take care that hisgrandson be poor, and then we shall all keep equal; let every mantake care of himself, and if England should come to bother usagain, why then we will fight altogether."Could any thing be better imagined than such a government for apeople so circumstanced?  Or is it strange that they arecontented with it?  Still less is it strange that those who havelived in the repose of order, and felt secure that their countrycould go on very well, and its business proceed without theirbawling and squalling, scratching and scrambling to help it,should bless the gods that they are not republicans.So far all is well.  That they should prefer a constitution whichsuits them so admirably, to one which would not suit them at all,is surely no cause of quarrel on our part; nor should it be suchon theirs, if we feel no inclination to exchange the institutionswhich have made us what we are, for any other on the face of theearth.But when a native of Europe visits America, a most extraordinaryspecies of tyranny is set in action against him; and as far as myreading and experience have enabled me to judge, it is such as noother country has ever exercised against strangers.The Frenchman visits England; he is _abime d'ennui_ at ourstately dinners; shrugs his shoulders at our _corps de ballet_,and laughs _a gorge deployee_ at our passion for driving, andour partial affection for roast beef and plum pudding.  TheEnglishman returns the visit, and the first thing he does onarriving at Paris, is to hasten to _le Theatre des Varietes_,that he may see "_Les Anglaises pour rire_," and if among thecrowd of laughters, you hear a note of more cordial mirth thanthe rest, seek out the person from whom it proceeds, and youwill find the Englishman.The Italian comes to our green island, and groans at our climate;he vows that the air which destroys a statue cannot be wholesomefor man; he sighs for orange trees, and maccaroni, and smiles atthe pretensions of a nation to poetry, while no epics arechaunted through her streets.  Yet we welcome the sensitivesouthern with all kindness, listen to his complaints withinterest, cultivate our little orange trees, and teach ourchildren to lisp Tasso, in the hope of becoming more agreeable.Yet we are not at all superior to the rest of Europe in ourendurance of censure, nor is this wish to profit by it allpeculiar to the English; we laugh at, and find fault with, ourneighbours quite as freely as they do with us, and they join thelaugh, and adopt our fashions and our customs.  These mutualpleasantries produce no shadow of unkindly feeling; and as longas the governments are at peace with each other, the individualsof every nation in Europe make it a matter of pride, as well asof pleasure, to meet each other frequently, to discuss, compare,and reason upon their national varieties, and to vote it a markof fashion and good taste to imitate each other in all theexternal embellishments of life.The consequence of this is most pleasantly perceptible at thepresent time, in every capital of Europe.  The long peace hasgiven time for each to catch from each what was best in customsand manners, and the rapid advance of refinement and generalinformation has been the result.To those who have been accustomed to this state of things, thecontrast upon crossing to the new world is inconceivablyannoying; and it cannot be doubted that this is one great causeof the general feeling of irksomeness, and fatigue of spirits,which hangs upon the memory while recalling the hours passed inAmerican society.A single word indicative of doubt, that any thing, or everything, in that country is not the very best in the world,produces an effect which must be seen and felt to be understood.If the citizens of the United States were indeed the devotedpatriots they call themselves, they would surely not thus encrustthemselves in the hard, dry, stubborn persuasion, that they arethe first and best of the human race, that nothing is to belearnt, but what they are able to teach, and that nothing isworth having, which they do not possess.The art of man could hardly discover a more effectual antidote toimprovement, than this persuasion; and yet I never listened toany public oration, or read any work, professedly addressed tothe country, in which they did not labour to impress it on theminds of the people.To hint to the generality of Americans that the silent current ofevents may change their beloved government, is not the way toplease them; but in truth they need be tormented with no suchfear.  As long as by common consent they can keep down thepre-eminence which nature has assigned to great powers, as longas they can prevent human respect and human honour from restingupon high talent, gracious manners, and exalted station, so longmay they be sure of going on as they are.I have been told, however, that there are some among them whowould gladly see a change; some, who with the wisdom ofphilosophers, and the fair candour of gentlemen, shrink from aprofession of equality which they feel to be untrue, and believeto be impossible.I can well believe that such there are, though to me no suchopinions were communicated, and most truly should I rejoice tosee power pass into such hands.If this ever happens, if refinement once creeps in among them, ifthey once learn to cling to the graces, the honours, the chivalryof life, then we shall say farewell to American equality, andwelcome to European fellowship one of the finest countries on theearth.THE ENDEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Domestic Manners of the Americansby Fanny Trollope*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOMESTIC MANNERS OF THE AMERICANS ******** This file should be named 10345.txt or 10345.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/3/4/10345/Produced by David G JohnsonUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

SCARBOROUGH'S FAMILY***E-text prepared by Steven desJardins, Joseph E. Loewenstein, M.D., andProject Gutenberg Distributed ProofreadersMR. SCARBOROUGH'S FAMILYBY ANTHONY TROLLOPE1883PART I.CHAPTER I.MR. SCARBOROUGH.It will be necessary, for the purpose of my story, that I shall go backmore than once from the point at which it begins, so that I may explainwith the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred, whichled up to the incidents that I am about to tell; and I may as well saythat these first four chapters of the book--though they may be thoughtto be the most interesting of them all by those who look to incidentsfor their interest in a tale--are in this way only preliminary.The world has not yet forgotten the intensity of the feeling whichexisted when old Mr. Scarborough declared that his well-known eldest sonwas not legitimate. Mr. Scarborough himself had not been well known inearly life. He had been the only son of a squire in Staffordshire overwhose grounds a town had been built and pottery-works established. Inthis way a property which had not originally been extensive had beengreatly increased in value, and Mr. Scarborough, when he came intopossession, had found himself to be a rich man. He had then gone abroad,and had there married an English lady. After the lapse of some years hehad returned to Tretton Park, as his place was named, and there had losthis wife. He had come back with two sons, Mountjoy and Augustus, andthere, at Tretton, he had lived, spending, however, a considerableportion of each year in chambers in the Albany. He was a man who,through many years, had had his own circle of friends, but, as I havesaid before, he was not much known in the world. He was luxurious andself-indulgent, and altogether indifferent to the opinion of thosearound him. But he was affectionate to his children, and anxious aboveall things for their welfare, or rather happiness. Some marvellousstories were told as to his income, which arose chiefly from theTretton delf-works and from the town of Tretton, which had been builtchiefly on his very park, in consequence of the nature of the clay andthe quality of the water. As a fact, the original four thousand a year,to which his father had been born, had grown to twenty thousand bynature of the operations which had taken place. But the whole of this,whether four thousand or twenty thousand, was strictly entailed, and Mr.Scarborough had been very anxious, since his second son was born, tocreate for him also something which might amount to opulence. But theywho knew him best knew that of all things he hated most the entail.The boys were both educated at Eton, and the elder went into the Guards,having been allowed an intermediate year in order to learn languages onthe Continent. He had then become a cornet in the Coldstreams, and had,from that time, lived a life of reckless expenditure. His brotherAugustus had in the mean time gone to Cambridge and become a barrister.He had been called but two years when the story was made known of hisfather's singular assertion. As from that time it became unnecessary forhim to practise his profession, no more was heard of him as a lawyer. Butthey who had known the young man in the chambers of that great luminary,Mr. Rugby, declared that a very eminent advocate was now spoiled by afreak of fortune.Of his brother Mountjoy,--or Captain Scarborough, as he came to be knownat an early period of his life,--the stories which were told in the worldat large were much too remarkable to be altogether true. But it was onlytoo true that he lived as though the wealth at his command were withoutlimit. For some few years his father bore with him patiently, doublinghis allowance, and paying his bills for him again and again. He made uphis mind,--with many regrets,--that enough had been done for his youngerson, who would surely by his intellect be able to do much for himself.But then it became necessary to encroach on the funds already put by,and at last there came the final blow, when he discovered that CaptainScarborough had raised large sums on post-obits from the Jews. The Jewssimply requested the father to pay the money or some portion of it,which if at once paid would satisfy them, explaining to him thatotherwise the whole property would at his death fall into their hands.It need not here be explained how, through one sad year, thesenegotiations were prolonged; but at last there came a time in which Mr.Scarborough, sitting in his chambers in the Albany, boldly declared hispurpose. He sent for his own lawyer, Mr. Grey, and greatly astonishedthat gentleman by declaring to him that Captain Scarborough wasillegitimate.At first Mr. Grey refused altogether to believe the assertion made tohim. He had been very conversant with the affairs of the family, and hadeven dealt with marriage settlements on behalf of the lady in question.He knew Mr. Scarborough well,--or rather had not known him, but had heardmuch of him,--and therefore suspected him. Mr. Grey was a thoroughlyrespectable man, and Mr. Scarborough, though upright and honorable inmany dealings, had not been thoroughly respectable. He had lived withhis wife off and on, as people say. Though he had saved much of hismoney for the purpose above described, he had also spent much of it in amanner which did not approve itself to Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey had thoroughlydisliked the eldest son, and had, in fact, been afraid of him. Thecaptain, in the few interviews that had been necessary between them, hadattempted to domineer over the lawyer, till there had at last sprung upa quarrel, in which, to tell the truth, the father took the part of theson. Mr. Grey had for a while been so offended as to find it necessaryto desire Mr. Scarborough to employ another lawyer. He had not, however,done so, and the breach had never become absolute. In thesecircumstances Mr. Scarborough had sent for Mr. Grey to come to him atthe Albany, and had there, from his bed, declared that his eldest sonwas illegitimate. Mr. Grey had at first refused to accept the assertionas being worth anything, and had by no means confined himself to politelanguage in expressing his belief. "I would much rather have nothing todo with it," he had said when Mr. Scarborough insisted on the truth ofhis statement."But the evidence is all here," said Mr. Scarborough, laying his hand ona small bundle of papers. "The difficulty would have been, and thedanger, in causing Mountjoy to have been accepted in his brother'splace. There can be no doubt that I was not married till after Mountjoywas born."Mr. Grey's curiosity was roused, and he began to ask questions. Why, inthe first place, had Mr. Scarborough behaved so dishonestly? Why had heoriginally not married his wife? And then, why had he married her? If,as he said, the proofs were so easy, how had he dared to act so directlyin opposition to the laws of his country? Why, indeed, had he beenthrough the whole of his life so bad a man,--so bad to the woman who hadborne his name, so bad to the son whom he called illegitimate, and sobad also to the other son whom he now intended to restore to hisposition, solely with the view of defrauding the captain's creditors?In answer to this Mr. Scarborough, though he was suffering much at thetime,--so much as to be considered near to his death,--had replied withthe most perfect good-humor.He had done very well, he thought, by his wife, whom he had marriedafter she had consented to live with him on other terms. He had donevery well by his elder son, for whom he had intended the entireproperty. He had done well by his second son, for whom he had saved hismoney. It was now his first duty to save the property. He regardedhimself as being altogether unselfish and virtuous from his point ofview.When Mr. Grey had spoken about the laws of his country he had simplysmiled, though he was expecting a grievous operation on the followingday. As for marriage, he had no great respect for it, except as a modeof enabling men and women to live together comfortably. As for the"outraged laws of his country," of which Mr. Grey spoke much, he did notcare a straw for such outrages--nor, indeed, for the expressed opinionof mankind as to his conduct. He was very soon about to leave the world,and meant to do the best he could for his son Augustus. The other sonwas past all hope. He was hardly angry with his eldest son, who hadundoubtedly given him cause for just anger. His apparent motives intelling the truth about him at last were rather those of defrauding theJews, who had expressed themselves to him with brutal audacity, thanthat of punishing the one son or doing justice to the other; but even ofthem he spoke with a cynical good-humor, triumphing in his idea ofthoroughly getting the better of them."I am consoled, Mr. Grey," he said, "when I think how probably it mightall have been discovered after my death. I should have destroyed allthese," and he laid his hands upon the papers, "but still there mighthave been discovery."Mr. Grey could not but think that during the last twenty-four years,--theperiod which had elapsed since the birth of the younger son,--no idea ofsuch a truth had occurred to himself.He did at last consent to take the papers in his hands, and to read themthrough with care. He took them away with that promise, and with anassurance that he would bring them back on the day but onefollowing--should Mr. Scarborough then be alive.Mr. Scarborough, who seemed at that moment to have much life in him,insisted on this proviso:--"The surgeon is to be here to-morrow, you know, and his coming may meana great deal. You will have the papers, which are quite clear, and willknow what to do. I shall see Mountjoy myself this evening. I suppose hewill have the grace to come, as he does not know what he is coming for."Then the father smiled again, and the lawyer went.Mr. Scarborough, though he was very strong of heart, did have somemisgivings as the time came at which he was to see his son. Thecommunication which he had to make was certainly one of vitalimportance. His son had some time since instigated him to come to termswith the "family creditors," as the captain boldly called them."Seeing that I never owed a shilling in my life, or my father before me,it is odd that I should have family creditors," the father had answered."The property has, then, at any rate," the son had said, with a scowl.But that was now twelve months since, before mankind and the Jews amongthem had heard of Mr. Scarborough's illness. Now, there could be noquestion of dealing on favorable terms with these gentlemen. Mr.Scarborough was, therefore, aware that the evil thing which he was aboutto say to his son would have lost its extreme bitterness. It did notoccur to him that, in making such a revelation as to his son's mother hewould inflict any great grief on his son's heart. To be illegitimatewould be, he thought, nothing unless illegitimacy carried with it lossof property. He hardly gave weight enough to the feeling that the eldestson was the eldest son, and too little to the triumph which was presentto his own mind in saving the property for one of the family. Augustuswas but the captain's brother, but he was the old squire's son. The twobrothers had hitherto lived together on fairly good terms, for theyounger had been able to lend money to the elder, and the elder hadfound his brother neither severe or exacting. How it might be betweenthem when their relations with each other should be altogether changed,Mr. Scarborough did not trouble himself to inquire. The captain by hisown reckless folly had lost his money, had lost all that fortune wouldhave given him as his father's eldest son. After having done so, whatcould it matter to him whether he were legitimate or illegitimate? Hisbrother, as possessor of Tretton Park, would be able to do much morefor him than could be expected from a professional man working for hisbread.Mr. Scarborough had looked at the matter all round for the space of twoyears, and during the latter year had slowly resolved on his line ofaction. He had had no scruple in passing off his eldest-born aslegitimate, and now would have none in declaring the truth to the world.What scruple need he have, seeing that he was so soon about to leave theworld?As to what took place at that interview between the father and the sonvery much was said among the clubs, and in societies to which CaptainMountjoy Scarborough was well known; but very little of absolute truthwas ever revealed. It was known that Captain Scarborough left the roomunder the combined authority of apothecaries and servants, and that theold man had fainted from the effects of the interview. He hadundoubtedly told the son of the simple facts as he had declared them toMr. Grey, but had thought it to be unnecessary to confirm his statementby any proof. Indeed, the proofs, such as they were,--the writtentestimony, that is,--were at that moment in the hands of Mr. Grey, and toMr. Grey the father had at last referred the son. But the son hadabsolutely refused to believe for a moment in the story, and haddeclared that his father and Mr. Grey had conspired together to rob himof his inheritance and good name. The interview was at last over, andMr. Scarborough, at one moment fainting, and in the next suffering theextremest agony, was left alone with his thoughts.Captain Scarborough, when he left his father's rooms, and found himselfgoing out from the Albany into Piccadilly, was an infuriated but at thesame time a most wretched man. He did believe that a conspiracy had beenhatched, and he was resolved to do his best to defeat it, let the effectbe what it might on the property; but yet there was a strong feeling inhis breast that the fraud would be successful. No man could possibly beenvironed by worse circumstances as to his own condition. He owed heknew not what amount of money to several creditors; but then he owed,which troubled him more, gambling debts, which he could only pay by hisbrother's assistance. And now, as he thought of it, he felt convincedthat his brother must be joined with his father and the lawyer in thisconspiracy. He felt, also, that he could meet neither Mr. Grey nor hisbrother without personally attacking them. All the world might perish,but he, with his last breath, would declare himself to be CaptainMountjoy Scarborough, of Tretton Park; and though he knew at the momentthat he must perish,--as regarded social life among his comrades,--unlesshe could raise five hundred pounds from his brother, yet he felt that,were he to meet his brother, he could not but fly at his throat andaccuse him of the basest villany.At that moment, at the corner of Bond Street, he did meet his brother."What is this?" said he, fiercely."What is what?" said Augustus, without any fierceness. "What is up now?""I have just come from my father.""And how is the governor? If I were he I should be in a most awful funk.I should hardly be able to think of anything but that man who is to cometo-morrow with his knives. But he takes it all as cool as a cucumber."There was something in this which at once shook, though it did notremove, the captain's belief, and he said something as to the property.Then there came questions and answers, in which the captain did notreveal the story which had been told to him, but the barrister didassert that he had as yet heard nothing as to anything of importance. Asto Tretton, the captain believed his brother's manner rather than hiswords. In fact, the barrister had heard nothing as yet of what was to bedone on his behalf.The interview ended in the two men going and dining at a club, where thecaptain told the whole story of his father's imagined iniquity.Augustus received the tale almost in silence. In reply to his brother'sauthoritative, domineering speeches he said nothing. To him it was allnew, but to him, also, it seemed certainly to be untrue. He did not atall bring himself to believe that Mr. Grey was in the conspiracy, but hehad no scruple of paternal regard to make him feel that this fatherwould not concoct such a scheme simply because he was his father. Itwould be a saving of the spoil from the Amalekites, and of this idea hedid give a hardly-expressed hint to his brother."By George," said the captain, "nothing of the kind shall be done withmy consent.""Why, no," the barrister had answered, "I suppose that neither yourconsent nor mine is to be asked; and it seems as though it were a farceordered to be played over the poor governor's grave. He has prepared aromance, as to the truth or falsehood of which neither you nor I canpossibly be called as witnesses."It was clear to the captain that his brother had thought that the plothad been prepared by their father in anticipation of his own death.Nevertheless, by the younger brother's assistance, the much-needed sumof money was found for the supply of the elder's immediate wants.The next day was the day of terror, and nothing more was heard, eitherthen or for the following week, of the old gentleman's scheme. In twodays it was understood that his death might be hourly expected, but onthe third it was thought that he might "pull through," as his youngerson filially expressed himself. He was constantly with his father, butnot a word passed his lips as to the property. The elder son kepthimself gloomily apart, and indeed, during a part of the next week wasout of London. Augustus Scarborough did call on Mr. Grey, but onlylearned from him that it was, at any rate, true that the story had beentold by his father. Mr. Grey refused to make any farther communication,simply saying that he would as yet express no opinion."For myself," said Augustus, as he left the attorney's chambers, "I canonly profess myself so much astonished as to have no opinion. I supposeI must simply wait and see what Fortune intends to do with me."At the end of a fortnight Mr. Scarborough had so far recovered hisstrength as to be able to be moved down to Tretton, and thither he went.It was not many days after that "the world" was first informed thatCaptain Scarborough was not his father's heir. "The world" received theinformation with a great deal of expressed surprise and inwardsatisfaction,--satisfaction that the money-lenders should be done out oftheir money; that a professed gambler like Captain Scarborough shouldsuddenly become an illegitimate nobody; and, more interesting still,that a very wealthy and well-conditioned, if not actually respectable,squire should have proved himself to be a most brazen-faced rascal. Allof these were matters which gave extreme delight to the world at large.At first there came little paragraphs without any name, and then, somehours afterward, the names became known to the quidnuncs, and in a shortspace of time were in possession of the very gentry who found themselvesdefrauded in this singular manner.It is not necessary here that I should recapitulate all thecircumstances of the original fraud, for a gross fraud had beenperpetrated. After the perpetration of that fraud papers had beenprepared by Mr. Scarborough himself with a great deal of ingenuity, andthe matter had been so arranged that,--but for his own declaration,--hiseldest son would undoubtedly have inherited the property. Now there wasno measure to the clamor and the uproar raised by the money-lenders. Mr.Grey's outer office was besieged, but his clerk simply stated that thefacts would be proved on Mr. Scarborough's death as clearly as it mightbe possible to prove them. The curses uttered against the old squirewere bitter and deep, but during this time he was still supposed to belying at death's door, and did not, in truth, himself expect to livemany days. The creditors, of course, believed that the story was afiction. None of them were enabled to see Captain Scarborough, who,after a short period, disappeared altogether from the scene. But theywere, one and all, convinced that the matter had been arranged betweenhim and his father.There was one from whom better things were expected than to advancemoney on post-obits to a gambler at a rate by which he was to be repaidone hundred pounds for every forty pounds, on the death of a gentlemanwho was then supposed to be dying. For it was proved afterward that thisMr. Tyrrwhit had made most minute inquiries among the old squire'sservants as to the state of their master's health. He had supplied fortythousand pounds, for which he was to receive one hundred thousand poundswhen the squire died, alleging that he should have difficulty inrecovering the money. But he had collected the sum so advanced on betterterms among his friends, and had become conspicuously odious in thematter.In about a month's time it was generally believed that Mr. Scarboroughhad so managed matters that his scheme would be successful. A strugglewas made to bring the matter at once into the law courts, but theattempt for the moment failed. It was said that the squire down atTretton was too ill, but that proceedings would be taken as soon as hewas able to bear them. Rumors were afloat that he would be taken intocustody, and it was even asserted that two policemen were in the houseat Tretton. But it was soon known that no policemen were there, and thatthe squire was free to go whither he would, or rather whither he could.In fact, though the will to punish him, and even to arrest him, wasthere, no one had the power to do him an injury.It was then declared that he had in no sense broken the law,--that noevil act of his could be proved,--that though he had wished his eldestson to inherit the property wrongfully, he had only wished it; and thathe had now simply put his wishes into unison with the law, and hadundone the evil which he had hitherto only contemplated. Indeed, theworld at large rather sympathized with the squire when Mr. Tyrrwhit'sdealings became known, for it was supposed by many that Mr. Tyrrwhit wasto have become the sole owner of Tretton.But the creditors were still loud, and still envenomed. They and theiremissaries hung about Tretton and demanded to know where was thecaptain. Of the captain's whereabouts his father knew nothing, not evenwhether he was still alive; for the captain had actually disappearedfrom the world, and his creditors could obtain no tidings respectinghim. At this period, and for long afterward, they imagined that he andhis father were in league together, and were determined to try at lawthe question as to the legitimacy of his birth as soon as the old squireshould be dead. But the old squire did not die. Though his life wassupposed to be most precarious he still continued to live, and becameeven stronger. But he remained shut up at Tretton, and utterly refusedto see any emissary of any creditor. To give Mr. Tyrrwhit his due, itmust be acknowledged that he personally sent no emissaries, havingcontented himself with putting the business into the hands of a verysharp attorney. But there were emissaries from others, who after a whilewere excluded altogether from the park.Here Mr. Scarborough continued to live, coming out on to the lawn in hiseasy-chair, and there smoking his cigar and reading his French novelthrough the hot July days. To tell the truth, he cared very little forthe emissaries, excepting so far as they had been allowed to interferewith his own personal comfort. In these days he had down with him two orthree friends from London, who were good enough to make up for him awhist-table in the country; but he found the chief interest in his lifein the occasional visits of his younger son."I look upon Mountjoy as utterly gone," he said."But he has utterly gone," his other son replied."As to that I care nothing. I do not believe that a man can be murderedwithout leaving a trace of his murder. A man cannot even throw himselfoverboard without being missed. I know nothing of his whereabouts,--nothing at all. But I must say that his absence is a relief to me.The only comfort left to me in this world is in your presence, andin those material good things which I am still able to enjoy."This assertion as to his ignorance about his eldest son the squirerepeated again and again to his chosen heir, feeling it was onlyprobable that Augustus might participate in the belief which he knew tobe only too common. There was, no doubt, an idea prevalent that thesquire and the captain were in league together to cheat the creditors,and that the squire, who in these days received much undeserved creditfor Machiavellian astuteness, knew more than any one else respecting hiseldest son's affairs. But, in truth, he at first knew nothing, and inmaking these assurances to his younger son was altogether wasting hisbreath, for his younger son knew everything.CHAPTER II.FLORENCE MOUNTJOY.Mr. Scarborough had a niece, one Florence Mountjoy, to whom it had beenintended that Captain Scarborough should be married. There had been noconsiderations of money when the intention had been first formed, forthe lady was possessed of no more than ten thousand pounds, which wouldhave been as nothing to the prospects of the captain when the idea wasfirst entertained. But Mr. Scarborough was fond of people who belongedto him. In this way he had been much attached to his latebrother-in-law, General Mountjoy, and had perceived that his niece wasbeautiful and graceful, and was in every way desirable, as one who mightbe made in part thus to belong to himself. Florence herself, when theidea of the marriage was first suggested to her by her mother, was onlyeighteen, and received it with awe rather than with pleasure orabhorrence. To her her cousin Mountjoy had always been a mostmagnificent personage. He was only seven years her senior, but he hadearly in life assumed the manners, as he had also done the vices, ofmature age, and loomed large in the girl's eyes as a man of undoubtedwealth and fashion. At that period, three years antecedent to hisfather's declaration, he had no doubt been much in debt, but his debtshad not been generally known, and his father had still thought that amarriage with his cousin might serve to settle him--to use the phrasewhich was common with himself. From that day to this the courtship hadgone on, and the squire had taught himself to believe that the twocousins were all but engaged to each other. He had so considered it, atany rate, for two years, till during the last final year he had resolvedto throw the captain overboard. And even during this year there had beenperiods of hope, for he had not finally made up his mind till but ashort time before he had put it in practice. No doubt he was fond of hisniece in accordance with his own capability for fondness. He wouldcaress her and stroke her hair, and took delight in having her near tohim. And of true love for such a girl his heart was quite capable. Hewas a good-natured, fearless, but not a selfish man, to whom the fate inlife of this poor girl was a matter of real concern.And his eldest son, who was by no means good-natured, had something ofthe same nature. He did love truly,--after his own fashion of loving. Hewould have married his cousin at any moment, with or without her tenthousand pounds,--for of all human beings he was the most reckless. Andyet in his breast was present a feeling of honor of which his fatherknew nothing. When it was explained to him that his mother's fair namewas to be aspersed,--a mother whom he could but faintly remember,--thethreat did bring with it its own peculiar agony. But of this the squireneither felt or knew anything. The lady had long been dead, and could benone the better or the worse for aught that could be said of her. To thecaptain it was not so, and it was preferable to him to believe hisfather to be dishonest than his mother. He, at any rate, was in truth inlove with his cousin Florence, and when the story was told to him one ofits first effects was the bearing which it would have upon her mind.It has been said that within two or three days after the communicationhe had left London. He had done so in order that he might at once godown to Cheltenham and see his cousin. There Miss Mountjoy lived, withher mother.The time had been when Florence Mountjoy had been proud of her cousin,and, to tell the truth of her feelings, though she had never loved him,she had almost done so. Rumors had made their way through even to hercondition of life, and she in her innocence had gradually been taught tobelieve that Captain Scarborough was not a man whom she could be safe inloving. And there had, perhaps, come another as to whom her feelingswere different. She had, no doubt, at first thought that she would bewilling to become her cousin's wife, but she had never said as muchherself. And now both her heart and mind were set against him.Captain Scarborough, as he went down to Cheltenham, turned the matterover in his mind, thinking within himself how best he might carry outhis project. His intention was to obtain from his cousin an assurance ofher love, and a promise that it should not be shaken by any storieswhich his father might tell respecting him. For this purpose he he mustmake known to her the story his father had told him, and his ownabsolute disbelief in it. Much else must be confided to her. He mustacknowledge in part his own debts, and must explain that his father hadtaken this course in order to defraud the creditors. All this would bevery difficult; but he must trust in her innocence and generosity. Hethought that the condition of his affairs might be so represented thatthe story should tend rather to win her heart toward him than to turn itaway. Her mother had hitherto always been in his favor, and he had, infact, been received almost as an Apollo in the house at Cheltenham."Florence," he said, "I must see you alone for a few minutes. I knowthat your mother will trust you with me." This was spoken immediately onhis arrival, and Mrs. Mountjoy at once left the room. She had beentaught to believe that it was her daughter's duty to marry her cousin;and though she knew that the captain had done much to embarrass theproperty, she thought that this would be the surest way to settle him.The heir of Tretton Park was, in her estimation, so great a man thatvery much was to be endured at his hands.The meeting between the two cousins was very long, and when Mrs.Mountjoy at last returned unannounced to the room she found her daughterin tears."Oh, Florence, what is the matter?" asked her mother.The poor girl said nothing, but still continued to weep, while thecaptain stood by looking as black as a thunder-cloud."What is it, Mountjoy?" said Mrs. Mountjoy, turning to him."I have told Florence some of my troubles," said he, "and they seemed tohave changed her mind toward me."There was something in this which was detestable to Florence,--anunfairness, a dishonesty in putting off upon his trouble that absence oflove which she had at last been driven by his vows to confess. She knewthat it was not because of his present trouble, which she understood tobe terrible, but which she could not in truth comprehend. He had blurtedit all out roughly,--the story as told by his father of his mother'sdishonor, of his own insignificance in the world, of the threatenedloss of the property, of the heaviness of his debts,--and added hisconviction that his father had invented it all, and was, in fact, athorough rascal. The full story of his debts he kept back, not with anypredetermined falseness, but because it is so difficult for a man to ownthat he has absolutely ruined himself by his own folly. It was notwonderful that the girl should not have understood such a story as hadthen been told her. Why was he defending his mother? Why was he accusinghis father? The accusations against her uncle, whom she did know, weremore fearful to her than these mysterious charges against her aunt, whomshe did not know, from which her son defended her. But then he hadspoken passionately of his own love, and she had understood that. He hadbesought her to confess that she loved him, and then she had at oncebecome stubborn. There was something in the word "confess" which gratedagainst her feelings. It seemed to imply a conviction on his part thatshe did love him. She had never told him so, and was now sure that itwas not so. When he had pressed her she could only weep. But in herweeping she never for a moment yielded. She never uttered a single wordon which he could be enabled to build a hope. Then he had become blackerand still blacker, fiercer and still fiercer, more and more earnest inhis purpose, till at last he asked her whom it was that she loved--as shecould not love him. He knew well whom it was that he suspected;--and sheknew also. But he had no right to demand any statement from her on thathead. She did not think that the man loved her; nor did she know what tosay or to think of her own feelings. Were he, the other man, to come toher, she would only bid him go away; but why she should so bid him shehad hardly known. But now this dark frowning captain, with his bigmustache and his military look, and his general aspect of invinciblepower, threatened the other man."He came to Tretton as my friend," he said, "and by Heaven if he standsin my way, if he dare to cross between you and me, he shall answer itwith his life!"The name had not been mentioned; but this had been very terrible toFlorence, and she could only weep.He went away, refusing to stay to dinner, but said that on the followingafternoon he would again return. In the street of the town he met one ofhis creditors, who had discovered his journey to Cheltenham, and hadfollowed him."Oh, Captain Mountjoy, what is all dis that they are talking about inLondon?""What are they talking about?""De inheritance!" said the man, who was a veritable Jew, looking upanxiously in his face.The man had his acceptance for a very large sum of money, with anassurance that it should be paid on his father's death, for which he hadgiven him about two thousand pounds in cash."You must ask my father.""But is it true?""You must ask my father. Upon my word, I can tell you nothing else. Hehas concocted a tale of which I for one do not believe a word. I neverheard of the story till he condescended to tell it me the other day.Whether it be true or whether it be false, you and I, Mr. Hart, are inthe same boat.""But you have had de money.""And you have got the bill. You can't do anything by coming after me. Myfather seems to have contrived a very clever plan by which he can robyou; but he will rob me at the same time. You may believe me or not asyou please; but that you will find to be the truth."Then Mr. Hart left him, but certainly did not believe a word the captainhad said to him.To her mother Florence would only disclose her persistent intention ofnot marrying her cousin. Mrs. Mountjoy, over whose spirit the glamour ofthe captain's prestige was still potent, said much in his favor.Everybody had always intended the marriage, and it would be the settingright of everything. The captain, no doubt, owed a large sum of money,but that would be paid by Florence's fortune. So little did the poorlady know of the captain's condition. When she had been told that therehad been a great quarrel between the captain and his father, shedeclared that the marriage would set that all right."But, mamma, Captain Scarborough is not to have the property at all."Then Mrs. Mountjoy, believing thoroughly in entails, had declared thatall Heaven could not prevent it."But that makes no difference," said the daughter; "if I--I--I loved himI would marry him so much the more, if he had nothing."Then Mrs. Mountjoy declared that she could not understand it at all.On the next day Captain Scarborough came, according to his promise, butnothing that he could say would induce Florence to come into hispresence. Her mother declared that she was so ill that it would bewicked to disturb her.CHAPTER III.HARRY ANNESLEY.Together with Augustus Scarborough at Cambridge had been one HarryAnnesley, and he it was to whom the captain in his wrath had sworn toput an end if he should come between him and his love. Harry Annesleyhad been introduced to the captain by his brother, and an intimacy hadgrown up between them. He had brought him to Tretton Park when Florencewas there, and Harry had since made his own way to Cheltenham, and hadendeavored to plead his own cause after his own fashion. This he haddone after the good old English plan, which is said to be somewhatloutish, but is not without its efficacy. He had looked at her, anddanced with her, and done the best with his gloves and his cravat, andhad let her see by twenty unmistakable signs that in order to beperfectly happy he must be near her. Her gloves, and her flowers, andher other little properties were sweeter to him than any scents, andwere more valuable in his eyes than precious stones. But he had never asyet actually asked her to love him. But she was so quick a linguist thatshe had understood down to the last letter what all these tokens hadmeant. Her cousin, Captain Scarborough, was to her magnificent,powerful, but terrible withal. She had asked herself a thousand timeswhether it would be possible for her to love him and to become his wife.She had never quite given even to herself an answer to this questiontill she had suddenly found herself enabled to do so by hisover-confidence in asking her to confess that she loved him. She hadnever acknowledged anything, even to herself, as to Harry Annesley. Shehad never told herself that it would be possible that he should ask herany such question. She had a wild, dreamy, fearful feeling that,although it would be possible to her to refuse her cousin, it would beimpossible that she should marry any other while he should still bedesirous of making her his wife. And now Captain Scarborough hadthreatened Harry Annesley, not indeed by name, but still clearlyenough. Any dream of her own in that direction must be a vain dream.As Harry Annesley is going to be what is generally called the hero ofthis story, it is necessary that something should be said of theparticulars of his life and existence up to this period. There will befound to be nothing very heroic about him. He is a young man with morethan a fair allowance of a young man's folly;--it may also be said of ayoung man's weakness. But I myself am inclined to think that there wasbut little of a young man's selfishness, with nothing of falseness ordishonesty; and I am therefore tempted to tell his story.He was the son of a clergyman, and the eldest of a large family ofchildren. But as he was the acknowledged heir to his mother's brother,who was the squire of the parish of which his father was rector, it wasnot thought necessary that he should follow any profession. This unclewas the Squire of Buston, and was, after all, not a rich man himself.His whole property did not exceed two thousand a year, an income whichfifty years since was supposed to be sufficient for the moderate wantsof a moderate country gentleman; but though Buston be not very farremoved from the centre of everything, being in Hertfordshire and notmore than forty miles from London, Mr. Prosper lived so retired a life,and was so far removed from the ways of men, that he apparently did notknow but that his heir was as completely entitled to lead an idle lifeas though he were the son of a duke or a brewer. It must not, however,be imagined that Mr. Prosper was especially attached to his nephew. Whenthe boy left the Charter-house, where his uncle had paid hisschool-bills, he was sent to Cambridge, with an allowance of two hundredand fifty pounds a year, and that allowance was still continued to him,with an assurance that under no circumstances could it ever beincreased. At college he had been successful, and left Cambridge with acollege fellowship. He therefore left it with one hundred andseventy-five pounds added to his income, and was considered by all thoseat Buston Rectory to be a rich young man.But Harry did not find that his combined income amounted to riches amida world of idleness. At Buston he was constantly told by his uncle ofthe necessity of economy. Indeed, Mr. Prosper, who was a sickly littleman about fifty years of age, always spoke of himself as though heintended to live for another half-century. He rarely walked across thepark to the rectory, and once a week, on Sundays, entertained therectory family. A sad occasion it generally was to the elder of therectory children, who were thus doomed to abandon the loud pleasantriesof their own home for the sober Sunday solemnities of the Hall. It wasnot that the Squire of Buston was peculiarly a religious man, or thatthe rector was the reverse: but the parson was joyous, whereas the otherwas solemn. The squire,--who never went to church, because he was supposedto be ill,--made up for the deficiency by his devotional tendencies whenthe children were at the Hall. He read through a sermon after dinner,unintelligibly and even inaudibly. At this his brother-in-law, who hadan evening service in his own church, of course never was present; butMrs. Annesley and the girls were there, and the younger children. ButHarry Annesley had absolutely declined; and his uncle having found outthat he never attended the church service, although he always left theHall with his father, made this a ground for a quarrel. It at last cameto pass that Mr. Prosper, who was jealous and irritable, would hardlyspeak to his nephew; but the two hundred and fifty pounds went on, withmany bickerings on the subject between the parson and the squire. Once,when the squire spoke of discontinuing it, Harry's father reminded himthat the young man had been brought up in absolute idleness, inconformity with his uncle's desire. This the squire denied in stronglanguage; but Harry had not hitherto run loudly in debt, nor kicked overthe traces very outrageously; and as he absolutely must be the heir, theallowance was permitted to go on.There was one lady who conceived all manner of bad things as to HarryAnnesley, because, as she alleged, of the want of a profession and ofany fixed income. Mrs. Mountjoy, Florence's mother, was this lady.Florence herself had read every word in Harry's language, not knowing,indeed, that she had read anything, but still never having missed asingle letter. Mrs. Mountjoy also had read a good deal, though not all,and dreaded the appearance of Harry as a declared lover. In her eyesCaptain Scarborough was a very handsome, very powerful, and very grandpersonage; but she feared that Florence was being induced to refuse herallegiance to this sovereign by the interference of her other veryindifferent suitor. What would be Buston and two thousand a year, ascompared with all the glories and limitless income of the great Trettonproperty? Captain Scarborough, with his mustaches and magnificence, wasjust the man who would be sure to become a peer. She had always heardthe income fixed at thirty thousand a year. What would a few debtssignify to thirty thousand a year? Such had been her thoughts up to theperiod of Captain Scarborough's late visit, when he had come toCheltenham, and had renewed his demand for Florence's hand somewhatroughly. He had spoken ambiguous words, dreadful words, declaring thatan internecine quarrel had taken place between him and his father; butthese words, though they had been very dreadful, had been altogethermisunderstood by Mrs. Mountjoy. The property she knew to be entailed,and she knew that when a property was entailed the present owner of ithad nothing to do with its future disposition. Captain Scarborough, atany rate, was anxious for the marriage, and Mrs. Mountjoy was inclinedto accept him, encumbered as he now was with his father's wrath, inpreference to poor Harry Annesley.In June Harry came up to London, and there learned at his club thesingular story in regard to old Mr. Scarborough and his son. Mr.Scarborough had declared his son illegitimate, and all the world knewnow that he was utterly penniless and hopelessly in debt. That he hadbeen greatly embarrassed Harry had known for many months, and added tothat was now the fact, very generally believed, that he was not andnever had been the heir to Tretton Park. All that still increasingproperty about Tretton, on which so many hopes had been founded, wouldbelong to his brother. Harry, as he heard the tale, immediatelyconnected it with Florence. He had, of course, known the captain was asuitor to the girl's hand, and there had been a time when he thoughtthat his own hopes were consequently vain. Gradually the convictiondawned upon him that Florence did not love the grand warrior, that shewas afraid of him rather and awe-struck. It would be terrible now wereshe brought to marry him by this feeling of awe. Then he learned thatthe warrior had gone down to Cheltenham, and in the restlessness of hisspirit he pursued him. When he reached Cheltenham the warrior hadalready gone."The property is certainly entailed," said Mrs. Mountjoy. He had calledat once at the house and saw the mother, but Florence was discreetlysent away to her own room when the dangerous young man was admitted."He is not Mr. Scarborough's eldest son at all," said Harry; "that is,in the eye of the law." Then he had to undertake that task, verydifficult for a young man, of explaining to her all the circumstances ofthe case.But there was something in them so dreadful to the lady's imaginationthat he failed for a long time to make her comprehend it. "Do you meanto say that Mr. Scarborough was not married to his own wife?""Not at first.""And that he knew it?""No doubt he knew it. He confesses as much himself.""What a very wicked man he must be!" said Mrs. Mountjoy. Harry couldonly shrug his shoulder. "And he meant to rob Augustus all through?"Harry again shrugged his shoulder. "Is it not much more probable that ifhe could be so very wicked he would be willing to deny his eldest son inorder to save paying the debts?"Harry could only declare that the facts were as he told them, or atleast that all London believed them to be so, that at any rate CaptainMountjoy had gambled so recklessly as to put himself for ever and everout of reach of a shilling of the property, and that it was clearly theduty of Mrs. Mountjoy, as Florence's mother, not to accept him as asuitor.It was only by slow degrees that the conversation had arrived at thispass. Harry had never as yet declared his own love either to the motheror daughter, and now appeared simply as a narrator of this terriblestory. But at this point it did appear to him that he must introducehimself in another guise."The fact is, Mrs. Mountjoy," he said, starting to his feet, "that I amin love with your daughter myself.""And therefore you have come here to vilify Captain Scarborough.""I have come," said he, "at any rate to tell the truth. If it be as Isay, you cannot think it right that he should marry your daughter. I saynothing of myself, but that, at any rate, cannot be.""It is no business of yours, Mr. Annesley.""Except that I would fain think that her business should be mine."But he could not prevail with Mrs. Mountjoy either on this day or thenext to allow him to see Florence, and at last was obliged to leaveCheltenham without having done so.CHAPTER IV.CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH'S DISAPPEARANCE.A few days after the visits to Cheltenham, described in the lastchapters, Harry Annesley, coming down a passage by the side of theJunior United Service Club into Charles Street, suddenly met CaptainScarborough at two o'clock in the morning. Where Harry had been at thathour need not now be explained, but it may be presumed that he had notbeen drinking tea with any of his female relatives.Captain Scarborough had just come out of some neighboring club, where hehad certainly been playing, and where, to all appearances, he had beendrinking also. That there should have been no policemen in the streetwas not remarkable, but there was no one else there present to give anyaccount of what took place during the five minutes in which the two menremained together. Harry, who was at the moment surprised by theencounter, would have passed the captain by without notice, had he beenallowed to do so; but this the captain perceived, and stopped himsuddenly, taking him roughly by the collar of his coat. This Harrynaturally resented, and before a word of intelligible explanation hadbeen given the two young men had quarrelled.Captain Scarborough had received a long letter from Mrs. Mountjoy,praying for explanation of circumstances which could not be explained,and stating over and over again that all her information had come fromHarry Annesley.The captain now called him an interfering, meddlesome idiot, and shookhim violently while holding him in his grasp. This was a usage whichHarry was not the man to endure, and there soon arose a scuffle, inwhich blows had passed between them. The captain stuck to his prey,shaking him again and again in his drunken wrath, till Harry, roused toa passion almost equal to that of his opponent, flung him at lastagainst the corner of the club railings, and there left his foesprawling upon the ground, having struck his head violently against theground as he fell. Harry passed on to his own bed, indifferent, as itwas afterwards said, to the fate of his antagonist. All this occupiedprobably five minutes in the doing, but was seen by no human eye.As the occurrence of that night was subsequently made the ground forheavy accusation against Harry Annesley, it has been told here withsufficient minuteness to show what might be said in justification or incondemnation of his conduct,--to show what might be said if the truthwere spoken. For, indeed, in the discussions which arose on the subject,much was said which was not true. When he had retired from the scuffleon that night, Harry had certainly not dreamed that any serious damagehad been done to the man who had certainly been altogether to blame inhis provocation of the quarrel. Had he kept his temper and feelingscompletely under control, and knocked down Captain Scarborough only inself-defence; had he not allowed himself to be roused to wrath bytreatment which could not but give rise to wrath in a young man's bosom,no doubt, when his foe lay at his feet, he would have stooped to pickhim up, and have tended his wounds. But such was not Harry'scharacter,--nor that of any of the young men with whom I have beenacquainted. Such, however, was the conduct apparently expected from himby many, when the circumstances of those five minutes were brought tothe light. But, on the other hand, had passion not completely got thebetter of him, had he not at the moment considered the attack made uponhim to amount to misconduct so gross as to supersede all necessity forgentle usage on his own part, he would hardly have left the man to liveor die as chance would have it. Boiling with passion, he went his way,and did leave the man on the pavement, not caring much, or rather, notthinking much, whether his victim might live or die.On the next day Harry Annesley left London and went down to Buston,having heard no word farther about the captain. He did not start tilllate in the afternoon, and during the day took some trouble to makehimself conspicuous about the town; but he heard nothing of CaptainScarborough. Twice he walked along Charles Street, and looked at thespot on which he had stood on the night before in what might have beendeadly conflict. Then he told himself that he had not been in the leastwounded, that the ferocious maddened man had attempted to do no morethan shake him, that his coat had suffered and not himself, and that inreturn he had certainly struck the captain with all his violence. Therewere probably some regrets, but he said not a word on the subject to anyone, and so he left London.For three or four days nothing was heard of the captain, nor wasanything said about him. He had lodgings in town, at which he was nodoubt missed, but he also had quarters at the barracks, at which he didnot often sleep, but to which it was thought possible on the nextmorning that he might have betaken himself. Before the evening of thatday had come he had no doubt been missed, but in the world at large nospecial mention was made of his absence for some time. Then, among thehaunts which he was known to frequent, questions began to be asked as tohis whereabouts, and to be answered by doubtful assertions that nothinghad been seen or heard of him for the last sixty or seventy hours.It must be remembered that at this time Captain Scarborough was stillthe subject of universal remark, because of the story told as to hisbirth. His father had declared him to be illegitimate, and had therebyrobbed all his creditors. Captain Scarborough was a man quite remarkableenough to insure universal attention for such a tale as this; but now,added to his illegitimacy was his disappearance. There was at first noidea that he had been murdered. It became quickly known to all the worldthat he had, on the night in question, lost a large sum of money at awhist-club which he frequented, and, in accordance with the custom ofthe club, had not paid the money on the spot.The fatal Monday had come round, and the money undoubtedly was not paid.Then he was declared a defaulter, and in due process of time his namewas struck off the club books, with some serious increase of theignominy hitherto sustained.During the last fortnight or more Captain Scarborough's name had beensubjected to many remarks and to much disgrace. But this non-payment ofthe money lost at whist was considered to be the turning-point. A manmight be declared illegitimate, and might in consequence of that or anyother circumstance defraud all his creditors. A man might conspire withhis father with the object of doing this fraudulently, as CaptainScarborough was no doubt thought to have done by most of hisacquaintances. All this he might do and not become so degraded but thathis friends would talk to him and play cards with him. But to have satdown to a whist-table and not be able to pay the stakes was held to beso foul a disgrace that men did not wonder that he should havedisappeared.Such was the cause alleged for the captain's disappearance among hisintimate friends; but by degrees more than his intimate friends came totalk of it. In a short time his name was in all the newspapers, andthere was not a constable in London whose mind was not greatly exercisedon the matter. All Scotland Yard and the police-officers were busy. Mr.Grey, in Lincoln's Inn, was much troubled on the matter. By degreesfacts had made themselves clear to his mind, and he had become awarethat the captain had been born before his client's marriage. He wasineffably shocked at the old squire's villany in the matter, butdeclared to all to whom he spoke openly on the subject that he did notsee how the sinner could be punished. He never thought that the fatherand son were in a conspiracy together. Nor had he believed that they hadarranged the young man's disappearance in order the more thoroughly todefraud the creditors. They could not, at any rate, harm a man of whosewhereabouts they were unaware and who, for all they knew, might be dead.But the reader is already aware that this surmise on the part of Mr.Grey was unfounded.The captain had been absent for three weeks when Augustus Scarboroughwent down for a second time to Tretton Park, in order to discuss thematter with his father.Augustus had, with much equanimity and a steady, fixed purpose, settledhimself down to the position as elder son. He pretended no anger to hisfather for the injury intended, and was only anxious that his own rightsshould be confirmed. In this he found that no great difficulty stood inhis way. The creditors would contest his rights when his father shoulddie; but for such contest he would be prepared. He had no doubt as tohis own position, but thought that it would be safer,--and that it wouldalso probably be cheaper,--to purchase the acquiescence of all claimantsthan to encounter the expense of a prolonged trial, to which there mightbe more than one appeal, and of which the end after all would bedoubtful.No very great sum of money would probably be required. No very great sumwould, at any rate, be offered. But such an arrangement would certainlybe easier if his brother were not present to be confronted with the menwhom he had duped.The squire was still ill down at Tretton, but not so ill but that he hadhis wits about him in all their clearness. Some said that he was not illat all, but that in the present state of affairs the retirement suitedhim. But the nature of the operation which he had undergone was known tomany who would not have him harassed in his present condition. In truth,he had only to refuse admission to all visitors and to take care thathis commands were carried out in order to avoid disagreeable intrusions."Do you mean to say that a man can do such a thing as this and that noone can touch him for it?" This was an exclamation made by Mr. Tyrrwhitto his lawyer, in a tone of aggrieved disgust."He hasn't done anything," said the lawyer. "He only thought of doingsomething, and has since repented. You cannot arrest a man because hehad contemplated the picking of your pocket, especially when he hasshown that he is resolved not to pick it.""As far as I can learn, nothing has been heard about him as yet," saidthe son to the father."Those limbs weren't his that were picked out of the Thames nearBlackfriars Bridge?""They belonged to a poor cripple who was murdered two months since.""And that body that was found down among the Yorkshire Hills?""He was a peddler. There is nothing to induce a belief that Mountjoy haskilled himself or been killed. In the former case his dead body would befound or his live body would be missing. For the second there is noimaginable cause for suspicion.""Then where the devil is he?" said the anxious father."Ah, that's the difficulty. But I can imagine no position in which a manmight be more tempted to hide himself. He is disgraced on every side,and could hardly show his face in London after the money he has lost.You would not have paid his gambling debts?""Certainly not," said the father. "There must be an end to all things.""Nor could I. Within the last month past he has drawn from me everyshilling that I have had at my immediate command.""Why did you give 'em to him?""It would be difficult to explain all the reasons. He was then my elderbrother, and it suited me to have him somewhat under my hand. At anyrate I did do so, and am unable for the present to do more. Lookinground about, I do not see where it was possible for him to raise asovereign as soon as it was once known that he was nobody.""What will become of him?" said the father. "I don't like the idea ofhis being starved. He can't live without something to live upon.""God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb," said the son. "For lambs suchas he there always seems to be pasture provided of one sort or another.""You would not like to have to trust to such pastures," said thefather."Nor should I like to be hanged; but I should have to be hanged if I hadcommitted murder. Think of the chances which he has had, and the way inwhich he has misused them. Although illegitimate, he was to have had thewhole property,--of which not a shilling belongs to him; and he has notlost it because it was not his own, but has simply gambled it away amongthe Jews. What can happen to a man in such a condition better than toturn up as a hunter among the Rocky Mountains or as a gold-digger inAustralia? In this last adventure he seems to have plunged horribly, andto have lost over three thousand pounds. You wouldn't have paid that forhim?""Not again;--certainly not again.""Then what could he do better than disappear? I suppose I shall have tomake him an allowance some of these days, and if he can live and keephimself dark I will do so."There was in this a tacit allusion to his father's speedy death whichwas grim enough; but the father passed it by without any expression ofdispleasure. He certainly owed much to his younger son, and was willingto pay it by quiescence. Let them both forbear. Such was the languagewhich he held to himself in thinking of his younger son. Augustus wascertainly behaving well to him. Not a word of rebuke had passed his lipsas to the infamous attempt at spoliation which had been made. The oldsquire felt grateful for his younger son's conduct, but yet in his heartof hearts he preferred the elder."He has denuded me of every penny," said Augustus, "and I must ask youto refund me something of what has gone.""He has kept me very bare. A man with so great a propensity for gettingrid of money I think no father ever before had to endure.""You have had the last of it.""I do not know that. If I live, and he lets me know his whereabouts, Icannot leave him penniless. I do feel that a great injustice has beendone him.""I don't exactly see it," said Augustus."Because you're too hard-hearted to put yourself in another man's place.He was my eldest son.""He thought that he was.""And should have remained so had there been a hope for him," said thesquire, roused to temporary anger. Augustus only shrugged hisshoulders. "But there is no good talking about it.""Not the least in the world. Mr. Grey, I suppose, knows the truth atlast. I shall have to get three or four thousand pounds from you, or Itoo must resort to the Jews. I shall do it, at any rate, under bettercircumstances than my brother."Some arrangement was at last made which was satisfactory to the son, andwhich we must presume that the father found to be endurable. Then theson took his leave, and went back to London, with the understoodintention of pushing the inquiries as to his brother's existence andwhereabouts.The sudden and complete disappearance of Captain Scarborough struck Mrs.Mountjoy with the deepest awe. It was not at first borne in upon her tobelieve that Captain Mountjoy Scarborough, an officer in theColdstreams, and the acknowledged heir to the Tretton property, hadvanished away as a stray street-sweeper might do, or some milliner'slowest work-woman. But at last there were advertisements in all thenewspapers and placards on all the walls, and Mrs. Mountjoy didunderstand that the captain was gone. She could as yet hardly believethat he was no longer heir to Tretton: and in such short discussionswith Florence as were necessary on the subject she preferred to expressno opinion whatever as to his conduct. But she would by no means giveway when urged to acknowledge that no marriage between Florence and thecaptain was any longer to be regarded as possible. While the captain wasaway the matter should be left as if in abeyance; but this by no meanssuited the young lady's views. Mrs. Mountjoy was not a reticent woman,and had no doubt been too free in whispering among her friends somethingof her daughter's position. This Florence had resented; but it had stillbeen done, and in Cheltenham generally she was regarded as an engagedyoung lady. It had been in vain that she had denied that it was so. Hermother's word on such a subject was supposed to be more credible thather own; and now this man with whom she was believed to be so closelyconnected had disappeared from the world among the most disreputablecircumstances. But when she explained the difficulty to her mother hermother bade her hold her tongue for the present, and seemed to hold outa hope that the captain might at last be restored to his old position."Let them restore him ever so much, he would never be anything to me,mamma." Then Mrs. Mountjoy would only shake her head and purse her lips.On the evening of the day after the fracas in the street Harry Annesleywent down to Buston, and there remained for the next two or three days,holding his tongue absolutely as to the adventure of that night. Therewas no one at Buston to whom he would probably have made known thecircumstances. But there was clinging to it a certain flavor ofdisreputable conduct on his own part which sealed his lips altogether.The louder and more frequent the tidings which reached his ears as tothe captain's departure, the more strongly did he feel that dutyrequired him to tell what he knew upon the matter. Many thoughts andmany fears encompassed him. At first was the idea that he had killed theman by the violence of his blow, or that his death had been caused bythe fall. Then it occurred to him that it was impossible thatScarborough should have been killed and that no account should be givenas to the finding of the body. At last he persuaded himself that hecould not have killed the man, but he was assured at the same time thatthe disappearance must in some sort have been occasioned by what thentook place. And it could not but be that the captain, if alive, shouldbe aware of the nature of the struggle which had taken place. He heard,chiefly from the newspapers, the full record of the captain'sillegitimacy; he heard of his condition with the creditors; he heard ofthose gambling debts which were left unpaid at the club. He saw it alsostated--and repeated--that these were the grounds for the man'sdisappearance. It was quite credible that the man should disappear, orendeavor to disappear, under such a cloud of difficulties. It did notrequire that he and his violence should be adduced as an extra cause.Indeed, had the man been minded to vanish before the encounter, he mightin all human probability have been deterred by the circumstances of thequarrel. It gave no extra reason for his disappearance, and could in nowise be counted with it were he to tell the whole story, in ScotlandYard. He had been grossly misused on the occasion, and had escaped fromsuch misusage by the only means in his power. But still he felt that,had he told the story, people far and wide would have connected his namewith the man's absence, and, worse again, that Florence's name wouldhave become entangled with it also. For the first day or two he had fromhour to hour abstained from telling all that he knew, and then when theday or two were passed, and when a week had run by,--when a fortnight hadbeen allowed to go,--it was impossible for him not to hold his tongue.He became nervous, unhappy, and irritated down at Buston, with hisfather and mother and sister's, but more especially with his uncle.Previous to this his uncle for a couple of months had declined to seehim; now he was sent for to the Hall and interrogated daily on thisspecial subject. Mr. Prosper was aware that his nephew had been intimatewith Augustus Scarborough, and that he might, therefore, be presumed toknow much about the family. Mr. Prosper took the keenest interest in theillegitimacy and the impecuniosity and final disappearance of thecaptain, and no doubt did, in his cross-examinations, discover the factthat Harry was unwilling to answer his questions. He found out for thefirst time that Harry was acquainted with the captain, and alsocontrived to extract from him the name of Miss Mountjoy. But he couldlearn nothing else, beyond Harry's absolute unwillingness to talk uponthe subject, which was in itself much. It must be understood that Harrywas not specially reverential in these communications. Indeed, he gavehis uncle to understand that he regarded his questions as impertinent,and at last declared his intention of not coming to the Hall any morefor the present. Then Mr. Prosper whispered to his sister that he wasquite sure that Harry Annesley knew more than he choose to say as toCaptain Scarborough's whereabouts."My dear Peter," said Mrs. Annesley, "I really think that you are doingpoor Harry an injustice."Mrs. Annesley was always on her guard to maintain something like anaffectionate intercourse between her own family and the squire."My dear Anne, you do not see into a millstone as far as I do. You neverdid.""But, Peter, you really shouldn't say such things of Harry. When all thepolice-officers themselves are looking about to catch up anything intheir way, they would catch him up at a moment's notice if they heardthat a magistrate of the county had expressed such an opinion.""Why don't he tell me?" said Mr. Prosper."There's nothing to tell.""Ah, that's your opinion--because you can't see into a millstone. I tellyou that Harry knows more about this Captain Scarborough than any oneelse. They were very intimate together.""Harry only just knew him.""Well, you'll see. I tell you that Harry's name will become mixed upwith Captain Scarborough's, and I hope that it will be in nodiscreditable manner. I hope so, that's all." Harry in the mean timehad returned to London, in order to escape his uncle, and to be on thespot to learn anything that might come in his way as to the nowacknowledged mystery respecting the captain.Such was the state of things at the commencement of the period to whichmy story refers.CHAPTER V.AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH.Harry Annesley, when he found himself in London, could not for a momentshake off that feeling of nervous anxiety as to the fate of MountjoyScarborough which had seized hold of him. In every newspaper which hetook in his hand he looked first for the paragraph respecting the fateof the missing man, which the paper was sure to contain in one of itscolumns. It was his habit during these few days to breakfast at a club,and he could not abstain from speaking to his neighbors about thewonderful Scarborough incident. Every man was at this time willing tospeak on the subject, and Harry's interest might not have seemed to bepeculiar; but it became known that he had been acquainted with themissing man, and Harry in conversation said much more than it would havebeen prudent for him to do on the understanding that he wished to remainunconnected with the story. Men asked him questions as though he werelikely to know; and he would answer them, asserting that he knewnothing, but still leaving an impression behind that he did know morethan he chose to avow. Many inquiries were made daily at this time inScotland Yard as to the captain. These, no doubt, chiefly came from thecreditors and their allies. But Harry Annesley became known among thosewho asked for information as Henry Annesley, Esq., late of St. John'sCollege, Cambridge; and even the police were taught to think that therewas something noticeable in the interest which he displayed.On the fourth day after his arrival in London, just at that time of theyear when everybody was supposed to be leaving town, and when fadedmembers of Parliament, who allowed themselves to be retained for thepurpose of final divisions, were cursing their fate amid the heats ofAugust, Harry accepted an invitation to dine with Augustus Scarboroughat his chambers in the Temple. He understood when he accepted theinvitation that no one else was to be there, and must have been awarethat it was the intention of the heir of Tretton to talk to himrespecting his brother. He had not seen Scarborough since he had been upin town, and had not been desirous of seeing him; but when theinvitation came he had told himself that it would be better that heshould accept it, and that he would allow his host to say what hepleased to say on the subject, he himself remaining reticent. But poorHarry little knew the difficulty of reticency when the heart is full. Hehad intended to be very reticent when he came up to London, and had, infact, done nothing but talk about the missing man, as to whom he haddeclared that he would altogether hold his tongue.The reader must here be pleased to remember that Augustus Scarboroughwas perfectly well aware of what had befallen his brother, and must,therefore, have known among other things of the quarrel which had takenplace in the streets. He knew, therefore, that Harry was concealing hisknowledge, and could make a fair guess at the state of the poor fellow'smind."He will guess," he had said to himself, "that he did not leave him fordead on the ground, or the body would be there to tell the tale. But hemust be ashamed of the part which he took in the street-fight, and beanxious to conceal it. No doubt Mountjoy was the first offender, butsomething had occurred which Annesley is unwilling should make its wayeither to his uncle's ears, or to his father's, or to mine, or to thesquire's,--or to those of Florence."It was thus that Augustus Scarborough reasoned with himself when heasked Harry Annesley to dine with him.It was not supposed by any of his friends that Augustus Scarboroughwould continue to live in the moderate chambers which he now occupied inthe Temple; but he had as yet made no sign of a desire to leave them.They were up two pair of stairs, and were not great in size; but theywere comfortable enough, and even luxurious, as a bachelor's abode."I've asked you to come alone," said Augustus, "because there is such acrowd of things to be talked of about poor Mountjoy which are notexactly fitted for the common ear.""Yes, indeed," said Harry, who did not, however, quite understand why itwould be necessary that the heir should discuss with him the affairs ofhis unfortunate brother. There had, no doubt, been a certain degree ofintimacy between them, but nothing which made it essential that thecaptain's difficulties should be exposed to him. The matter whichtouched him most closely was the love which both the men had borne toFlorence Mountjoy; but Harry did not expect that any allusion toFlorence would be made on the present occasion."Did you ever hear of such a devil of a mess?" said Augustus."No, indeed. It is not only that he has disappeared--""That is as nothing when compared with all the other incidents of thisromantic tale. Indeed, it is the only natural thing in it. Given all theother circumstances, I should have foretold his disappearance as a thingcertain to occur. Why shouldn't such a man disappear, if he can?""But how has he done it?" replied Harry. "Where has he gone to? At thismoment where is he?""Ah, if you will answer all those questions, and give your informationin Scotland Yard, the creditors, no doubt, will make up a handsome pursefor you. Not that they will ever get a shilling from him, though he wereto be seen walking down St. James's Street to-morrow. But they are asanguine gentry, these holders of bills, and I really believe that ifthey could see him they would embrace him with the warmest affection. Inthe mean time let us have some dinner, and we will talk about poorMountjoy when we have got rid of young Pitcher. Young Pitcher is mylaundress's son to the use of whose services I have been promoted sinceI have been known to be the heir of Tretton."Then they sat down and dined, and Augustus Scarborough made himselfagreeable. The small dinner was excellent of its kind, and the wine wasall that it ought to be. During dinner not a word was said as toMountjoy, nor as to the affairs of the estate. Augustus, who was old forhis age, and had already practised himself much in London life, knewwell how to make himself agreeable. There was plenty to be said whileyoung Pitcher was passing in and out of the room, so that there appearedno awkward vacancies of silence while one course succeeded the other.The weather was very hot, the grouse were very tempting, everybody wasvery dull, and members of Parliament more stupid than anybody else; buta good time was coming. Would Harry come down to Tretton and see the oldgovernor? There was not much to offer him in the way of recreation, butwhen September came the partridges would abound. Harry gave ahalf-promise that he would go to Tretton for a week, and AugustusScarborough expressed himself as much gratified. Harry at the momentthought of no reason why he should not go to Tretton, and thuscommitted himself to the promise; but he afterward felt that Tretton wasof all places the last which he ought just at present to visit.At last Pitcher and the cheese were gone, and young Scarborough producedhis cigars. "I want to smoke directly I've done eating," he said."Drinking goes with smoking as well as it does with eating, so thereneed be no stop for that. Now, tell me, Annesley, what is it that youthink about Mountjoy?"There was an abruptness in the question which for the moment struckHarry dumb. How was he to say what he thought about MountjoyScarborough, even though he should have no feeling to prevent him fromexpressing the truth? He knew, or thought that he knew, MountjoyScarborough to be a thorough blackguard; one whom no sense of honestykept from spending money, and who was now a party to robbing hiscreditors without the slightest compunction,--for it was in Harry's mindthat Mountjoy and his father were in league together to save theproperty by rescuing it from the hands of the Jews. He would havethought the same as to the old squire,--only that the old squire had notinterfered with him in reference to Florence Mountjoy.And then there was present to his mind the brutal attack which had beenmade on himself in the street. According to his views MountjoyScarborough was certainly a blackguard; but he did not feel inclinedquite to say so to the brother, nor was he perfectly certain as to hishost's honesty. It might be that the three Scarboroughs were all in aleague together; and if so, he had done very wrong, as he thenremembered, to say that he would go down to Tretton. When, therefore, hewas asked the question he could only hold his tongue."I suppose you have some scruple in speaking because he's my brother?You may drop that altogether.""I think that his career has been what the novel-reader would callromantic; but what I, who am not one of them, should describe asunfortunate.""Well, yes; taking it altogether it has been unfortunate. I am not asoft-hearted fellow, but I am driven to pity him. The worst of it isthat, had not my father been induced at last to tell the truth, frommost dishonest causes, he would not have been a bit better off than heis. I doubt whether he could have raised another couple of thousand onthe day when he went. If he had done so then, and again more and more,to any amount you choose to think of, it would have been the same withhim.""I suppose so.""His lust for gambling was a bottomless quicksand, which no possibleamount of winning could ever have satiated. Let him enter his club withfive thousand pounds at his banker's and no misfortune could touch him.He being such as he is,--or, alas! for aught we know, such as he was,--theescape which the property has had cannot but be regarded as veryfortunate. I don't care to talk much of myself in particular, though nowrong can have been done to a man more infinite than that which myfather contrived for me.""I cannot understand your father," said Harry. In truth, there wassomething in Scarborough's manner in speaking of his father which almostproduced belief in Harry's mind. He began to doubt whether Augustus wasin the conspiracy."No, I should say not. It is hard to understand that an Englishgentleman should have the courage to conceive such a plot, and the witto carry it out. If Mountjoy had run only decently straight, or not morethan indecently crooked, I should have been a younger brother,practising law in the Temple to the end of my days. The story of Esauand of Jacob is as nothing to it. But that is not the most remarkablecircumstance. My father, for purposes of his own, which includes theabsolute throwing over of Mountjoy's creditors, changes his plan, and ispleased to restore to me that of which he had resolved to rob me. Whatfather would dare to look in the face of the son whom he had thusresolved to defraud? My father tells me the story with a gentle chuckle,showing almost as much indifference to Mountjoy's ruin as to myrecovered prosperity. He has not a blush when he reveals it all. He hasnot a word to say, or, as far as I can see, a thought as to the world'sopinion. No doubt he is supposed to be dying. I do presume that three orfour months will see the end of him. In the mean time he takes it all asquietly as though he had simply lent a five-pound note to Mountjoy outof my pocket.""You, at any rate, will get your property?""Oh, yes; and that, no doubt, is his argument when he sees me. He isdelighted to have me down at Tretton, and, to tell the truth, I do notfeel the slightest animosity toward him. But as I look at him I thinkhim to be the most remarkable old gentleman that the world has everproduced. He is quite unconscious that I have any ground of complaintagainst him.""He has probably thought that the circumstances of your brother's birthshould not militate against his prospects.""But the law, my dear fellow," said Scarborough, getting up from hischair and standing with his cigar between his finger and thumb,--"the lawthinks otherwise. The making of all right and wrong in this worlddepends on the law. The half-crown in my pocket is merely mine becauseof the law. He did choose to marry my mother before I was born, but didnot choose to go through that ceremony before my brother's time. Thatmay be a trifle to you, or to my moral feeling may be a trifle; butbecause of that trifle all Tretton will be my property, and his attemptto rob me of it was just the same as though he should break into a bankand steal what he found there. He knows that just as well as I do, butto suit his own purposes he did it."There was something in the way in which the young man spoke both of hisfather and mother which made Harry's flesh creep. He could not but thinkof his own father and his own mother, and his feelings in regard tothem. But here this man was talking of the misdoings of the one parentand the other with the most perfect _sang-froid._ "Of course Iunderstand all that," said Harry."There is a manner of doing evil so easy and indifferent as absolutelyto quell the general feeling respecting it. A man shall tell you that hehas committed a murder in a tone so careless as to make you feel that amurder is nothing. I don't suppose my father can be punished for hisattempt to rob me of twenty thousand a year, and therefore he talks tome about it as though it were a good joke. Not only that, but he expectsme to receive it in the same way. Upon the whole, he prevails. I findmyself not in the least angry with him, and rather obliged to him thanotherwise for allowing me to be his eldest son.""What must Mountjoy's feelings be!" said Harry."Exactly; what must be Mountjoy's feelings! There is no need to considermy father's, but poor Mountjoy's! I don't suppose that he can be dead.""I should think not.""While a man is alive he can carry himself off, but when a fellow isdead it requires at least one or probably two to carry him. Men do notwish to undertake such a work secretly unless they've been concerned inthe murder; and then there will have been a noise which must have beenheard, or blood which must have been seen, and the body will at last beforthcoming, or some sign of its destruction. I do not think he bedead.""I should hope not," said Harry, rather tamely, and feeling that he wasguilty of a falsehood by the manner in which he expressed his hope."When was it you saw him last?" Scarborough asked the question with anabruptness which was predetermined, but which did not quite take Harryaback."About three months since--in London," said Harry, going back in hismemory to the last meeting, which had occurred before the squire haddeclared his purpose."Ah;--you haven't seen him, then, since he knew that he was nobody?" Thishe asked in an indifferent tone, being anxious not to discover hispurpose, but in doing so he gave Harry great credit for his readiness ofmind."I have not seen him since he heard the news which must have astonishedhim more than any one else.""I wonder," said Augustus, "how Florence Mountjoy has borne it?""Neither have I seen her. I have been at Cheltenham, but was not allowedto see her." This he said with an assertion to himself that though hehad lied as to one particular he would not lie as to any other."I suppose she must have been much cut up by it all. I have half a mindto declare to myself that she shall still have an opportunity ofbecoming the mistress of Tretton. She was always afraid of Mountjoy, butI do not know that she ever loved him. She had become so used to theidea of marrying him that she would have given herself up in mereobedience. I too think that she might do as a wife, and I shallcertainly make a better husband than Mountjoy would have done.""Miss Mountjoy will certainly do as a wife for any one who may be luckyenough to get her," said Harry, with a certain tone of magnificencewhich at the moment he felt to be overstrained and ridiculous."Oh yes; one has got to get her, as you call it, of course. You mean tosay that you are supposed to be in the running. That is your ownlookout. I can only allege, on my own behalf, that it has always beenconsidered to be an old family arrangement that Florence Mountjoy shallmarry the heir to Tretton Park. I am in that position now, and I onlythrow it out as a hint that I may feel disposed to follow out the familyarrangement. Of course if other things come in the way there will be anend of it. Come in." This last invitation was given in consequence of aknock at the door. The door was opened, and there entered a policeman inplain clothes named Prodgers, who seemed from his manner to be wellacquainted with Augustus Scarborough.The police for some time past had been very busy on the track ofMountjoy Scarborough, but had not hitherto succeeded in obtaining anyinformation. Such activity as had been displayed cannot be procuredwithout expense, and it had been understood in this case that old Mr.Scarborough had refused to furnish the means. Something he had suppliedat first, but had latterly declined even to subscribe to a fund. He wasnot at all desirous, he said, that his son should be brought back to theworld, particularly as he had made it evident by his disappearance thathe was anxious to keep out of the way. "Why should I pay the fellows?It's no business of mine," he had said to his son. And from that momenthe had declined to do more than make up the first subscription which hadbeen suggested to him. But the police had been kept very busy, and itwas known that the funds had been supplied chiefly by Mr. Tyrrwhit. Hewas a resolute and persistent man, and was determined to "run down"Mountjoy Scarborough, as he called it, if money would enable him to doso. It was he who had appealed to the squire for assistance in thisobject, and to him the squire had expressed his opinion that, as his sondid not seem anxious to be brought back, he should not interfere in thematter."Well, Prodgers, what news have you to-day?" asked Augustus."There is a man a-wandering about down in Skye, just here and there,with nothing in particular to say for himself.""What sort of a looking fellow is he?""Well, he's light, and don't come up to the captain's marks; but there'sno knowing what disguises a fellow will put on. I don't think he's gotthe captain's legs, and a man can't change his legs.""Captain Scarborough would not remain loitering about in Skye where hewould be known by half the autumn tourists who saw him.""That's just what I was saying to Wilkinson," said Prodgers. "Wilkinsonseems to think that a man may be anybody as long as nobody knows who heis. 'That ain't the captain,' said I.""I'm afraid he's got out of England," said the captain's brother."There's no place where he can be run down like New York, or Paris, orMelbourne, and it's them they mostly go to. We've wired 'em all three,and a dozen other ports of the kind. We catches 'em mostly if they goabroad; but when they remains at home they're uncommon troublesome.There was a man wandering about in County Donegal. We call Ireland athome, because we've so much to do with their police since the LandLeague came up; but this chap was only an artist who couldn't pay hisbill. What do you think about it, Mr. Annesley?" said the policeman,turning short round upon Harry, and addressing him a question. Whyshould the policeman even have known his name?"Who? I? I don't think about it at all. I have no means of thinkingabout it.""Because you have been so busy down there at the Yard, I thought that,as you was asking so many questions, you was, perhaps, interested in thematter.""My friend Mr. Annesley," said Augustus, "was acquainted with CaptainScarborough, as he is with me.""It did seem as though he was more than usually interested, all thesame," said the policeman."I am more than usually interested," replied Harry; "but I do not knowthat I am going to give you my reason. As to his present existence Iknow absolutely nothing.""I dare say not. If you'd any information as was reliable I dare say asit would be forthcoming. Well, Mr. Scarborough, you may be sure of this:if we can get upon his trail we'll do so, and I think we shall. Thereisn't a port that hasn't been watched from two days after hisdisappearance, and there isn't a port as won't be watched as soon as anyEnglish steamer touches 'em. We've got our eyes out, and we means to use'em. Good-night, Mr. Scarborough; good-night, Mr. Annesley," and hebobbed his head to our friend Harry. "You say as there is a reason as isunknown. Perhaps it won't be unknown always. Good-night, gentlemen."Then Constable Prodgers left the room.Harry had been disconcerted by the policeman's remarks, and showed thatit was so as soon as he was alone with Augustus Scarborough. "I'm afraidyou think the man intended to be impertinent," said Augustus."No doubt he did, but such men are allowed to be impertinent.""He sees an enemy, of course, in every one who pretends to know morethan he knows himself,--or, indeed, in every one who does not. You saidsomething about having a reason of your own, and he at once connectedyou with Mountjoy's disappearance. Such creatures are necessary, butfrom the little I've seen of them I do not think that they make the bestcompanions in the world. I shall leave Mr. Prodgers to carry on hisbusiness to the man who employs him,--namely, Mr. Tyrrwhit,--and I adviseyou to do the same."Soon after that Harry Annesley took his leave, but he could not divesthimself of an opinion that both the policeman and his host had thoughtthat he had some knowledge respecting the missing man. AugustusScarborough had said no word to that effect, but there had been asomething in his manner which had excited suspicion in Harry's mind. Andthen Augustus had declared his purpose of offering his hand and fortuneto Florence Mountjoy. He to be suitor to Florence,--he, so soon afterMountjoy had been banished from the scene! And why should he have beentold of it?--he, of whose love for the girl he could not but think thatAugustus Scarborough had been aware. Then, much perturbed in his mind,he resolved, as he returned to his lodgings, that he would go down toCheltenham on the following day.CHAPTER VI.HARRY ANNESLEY TELLS HIS SECRET.Harry hurried down to Cheltenham, hardly knowing what he was going to door say when he got there. He went to the hotel and dined alone. "What'sall this that's up about Captain Mountjoy?" said a stranger, coming andwhispering to him at his table.The inquirer was almost a stranger, but Harry did know his name. It wasMr. Baskerville, the hunting man. Mr. Baskerville was not rich, and notespecially popular, and had no special amusement but that of riding twonags in the winter along the roads of Cheltenham in the direction whichthe hounds took. It was still summer, and the nags, who had been made todo their work in London, were picking up a little strength in idleness,or, as Mr. Baskerville called it, getting into condition. In the meantime Mr. Baskerville amused himself as well as he could by lying in bedand playing lawn-tennis. He sometimes dined at the hotel, in order thatthe club might think that he was entertained at friends' houses; but thetwo places were nearly the same to him, as he could achieve a dinner andhalf a pint of wine for five or six shillings at each of them. A moreempty existence, or, one would be inclined to say, less pleasurable, noone could pass; but he had always a decent coat on his back and a smileon his face, and five shillings in his pocket with which to pay for hisdinner. His asking what was up about Scarborough showed, at any rate,that he was very backward in the world's news."I believe he has vanished," said Harry."Oh yes, of course he's vanished. Everybody knows that--he vanished everso long ago; but where is he?""If you can tell them in Scotland Yard they will be obliged to you.""I suppose it is true the police are after him? Dear me! Forty thousanda year! This is a very queer story about the property, isn't it?""I don't know the story exactly, and therefore can hardly say whether itis queer or not.""But about the younger son? People say that the father has contrivedthat the younger son shall have the money. What I hear is that the wholeproperty is to be divided, and that the captain is to have half, onconditions that he keeps out of the way. But I am sure that you knowmore about it. You used to be intimate with both the brothers. I haveseen you down here with the captain. Where is he?" And again hewhispered into Harry's ear. But he could not have selected any subjectmore distasteful, and, therefore, Harry repulsed Mr. Baskerville not inthe most courteous manner."Hang it! what airs that fellow gives himself," he said to anotherfriend of the same kidney. "That's young Annesley, the son of atwopenny-halfpenny parson down in Hertfordshire. The kind of waysthese fellows put on now are unbearable. He hasn't got a horse to rideon, but to hear him talk you'd think he was mounted three days a week.""He's heir to old Prosper, of Buston Hall.""How's that? But is he? I never heard that before. What's Buston Hallworth?" Then Mr. Baskerville made up his mind to be doubly civil toHarry Annesley the next time he saw him.Harry had to consider on that night in what manner he would endeavor tosee Florence Mountjoy on the next day. He was thoroughly discontentedwith himself as he walked about the streets of Cheltenham. He had nownot only allowed the disappearance of Scarborough to pass by withoutstating when and where, and how he had last seen him, but had directlylied on the subject. He had told the man's brother that he had not seenhim for some weeks previous, whereas to have concealed his knowledge onsuch a subject was in itself held to be abominable. He was ashamed ofhimself, and the more so because there was no one to whom he could talkopenly on the matter. And it seemed to him as though all whom he metquestioned him as to the man's disappearance, as if they suspected him.What was the man to him, or the man's guilt, or his father, that heshould be made miserable? The man's attack upon him had been ferociousin its nature,--so brutal that when he had escaped from MountjoyScarborough's clutches there was nothing for him but to leave him lyingin the street where, in his drunkenness, he had fallen. And now, inconsequence of this, misery had fallen upon himself. Even thisempty-headed fellow Baskerville, a man the poverty of whose characterHarry perfectly understood, had questioned him about MountjoyScarborough. It could not, he thought, be possible that Baskervillecould have had any reasons for suspicion, and yet the very sound of theinquiry stuck in his ears.On the next morning, at eleven o'clock, he knocked at Mrs. Mountjoy'shouse in Mountpellier Place and asked for the elder lady. Mrs. Mountjoywas out, and Harry at once inquired for Florence. The servant at firstseemed to hesitate, but at last showed Harry into the dining-room. Therehe waited five minutes, which seemed to him to be half an hour, and thenFlorence came to him. "Your mother is not at home," he said, putting outhis hand."No, Mr. Annesley, but I think she will be back soon. Will you wait forher?""I do not know whether I am not glad that she should be out. Florence, Ihave something that I must tell you.""Something that you must tell me!"He had called her Florence once before, on a happy afternoon which hewell remembered, but he was not thinking of that now. Her name, whichwas always in his mind, had come to him naturally, as though he had notime to pick and choose about names in the importance of thecommunication which he had to make. "Yes. I don't believe that you wereever really engaged to your cousin Mountjoy.""No, I never was," she answered, briskly. Harry Annesley was certainly ahandsome man, but no young man living ever thought less of his ownbeauty. He had fair, wavy hair, which he was always submitting to somebarber, very much to the unexpressed disgust of poor Florence; becauseto her eyes the longer the hair grew the more beautiful was the wearerof it. His forehead, and eyes, and nose were all perfect in their form--  "Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;  An eye like Mars, to threaten and command."There was a peculiar brightness in his eye, which would have seemed todenote something absolutely great in his character had it not been forthe wavering indecision of his mouth. There was as it were a vacillationin his lips which took away from the manliness of his physiognomy.Florence, who regarded his face as almost divine, was yet conscious ofsome weakness about his mouth which she did not know how to interpret.But yet, without knowing why it was so, she was accustomed to expectfrom him doubtful words, half expressed words, which would not declareto her his perfected thoughts--as she would have them declared. He wassix feet high, but neither broad nor narrow, nor fat nor thin, but avery Apollo in Florence's eye. To the elders who knew him thequintessence of his beauty lay in the fact that he was altogetherunconscious of it. He was a man who counted nothing on his personalappearance for the performance of those deeds which he was most anxiousto achieve. The one achievement now essentially necessary to hishappiness was the possession of Florence Mountjoy; but it certainlynever occurred to him that he was more likely to obtain this because hewas six feet high, or because his hair waved becomingly."I have supposed so," he said, in answer to her last assertion."You ought to have known it for certain. I mean to say that, had I everbeen engaged to my cousin, I should have been miserable at such a momentas this. I never should have given him up because of the gross injusticedone to him about the property. But his disappearance in this dreadfulway would, I think, have killed me. As it is, I can think of nothingelse, because he is my cousin.""It is very dreadful," said Harry. "Have you any idea what can havehappened to him?""Not in the least. Have you?""None at all, but--""But what?""I was the last person who saw him.""You saw him last!""At least, I know no one who saw him after me.""Have you told them?""I have told no one but you. I have come down here to Cheltenham onpurpose to tell you.""Why me?" she said, as though struck with fear at such an assertion onhis part."I must tell some one, and I have not known whom else to tell. Hisfather appears not at all anxious about him. His brother I do notaltogether trust. Were I to go to these men, who are only looking aftertheir money, I should be communicating with his enemies. Your motheralready regards me as his enemy. If I told the police I should simply bebrought into a court of justice, where I should be compelled to mentionyour name.""Why mine?""I must begin the story from the beginning. One night I was coming homein London very late, about two o'clock, when whom should I meet in thestreet suddenly but Mountjoy Scarborough. It came out afterward that hehad then been gambling; but when he encountered me he was intoxicated.He took me suddenly by the collar and shook me violently, and did hisbest to maltreat me. What words were spoken I cannot remember; but hisconduct to me was as that of a savage beast. I struggled with him in thestreet as a man would struggle who is attacked by a wild dog. I thinkthat he did not explain the cause of his hatred, though, of course, mymemory as to what took place at that moment is disturbed and imperfect;but I did know in my heart why it was that he had quarrelled with me.""Why was it?" Florence asked."Because he thought that I had ventured to love you.""No, no!" shrieked Florence; "he could not have thought that.""He did think so, and he was right enough. If I have never said sobefore, I am bound at any rate to say it now." He paused for a moment,but she made him no answer. "In the struggle between us he fell on thepavement against a rail;--and then I left him.""Well?""He has never been heard of since. On the following day, in theafternoon, I left London for Buston; but nothing had been then heard ofhis disappearance. I neither knew of it nor suspected it. The questionis, when others were searching for him, was I bound to go to the policeand declare what I had suffered from him that night? Why should Iconnect his going with the outrage which I had suffered?""But why not tell it all?""I should have been asked why he had quarrelled with me. Ought I to havesaid that I did not know? Ought I to have pretended that there was nocause? I did know, and there was a cause. It was because he thought thatI might prevail with you, now that he was a beggar, disowned by his ownfather.""I would never have given him up for that," said Florence."But do you not see that your name would have been brought in,--that Ishould have had to speak of you as though I thought it possible that youloved me?" Then he paused, and Florence sat silent. But another thoughtstruck him now. It occurred to him that under the plea put forward hewould appear to seek shelter from his silence as to her name. He wasaware how anxious he was on his own behalf not to mention the occurrencein the street, and it seemed that he was attempting to escape under thepretence of a fear that her name would be dragged in. "But independentlyof that I do not see why I should be subjected to the annoyance ofletting it be known that I was thus attacked in the streets. And thetime has now gone by. It did not occur to me when first he was missedthat the matter would have been of such importance. Now it is too late.""I suppose that you ought to have told his father.""I think that I ought to have done so. But at any rate I have come toexplain it all to you. It was necessary that I should tell some one.There seems to be no reason to suspect that the man has been killed.""Oh, I hope not; I hope not that.""He has been spirited away--out of the way of his creditors. For myselfI think that it has all been done with his father's connivance. Whetherhis brother be in the secret or not I cannot tell, but I suspect he is.There seems to be no doubt that Captain Scarborough himself has run sooverhead into debt as to make the payment of his creditors impossible byanything short of the immediate surrender of the whole property. Somemonth or two since they all thought that the squire was dying, and thatthere would be nothing to do but to sell the property which would thenbe Mountjoy's, and pay themselves. Against this the dying man hasrebelled, and has come, as it were, out of the grave to disinherit theson who has already contrived to disinherit himself. It is all aneffort to save Tretton.""But it is dishonest," said Florence."No doubt about it. Looking at it any way it is dishonest, Either theinheritance must belong to Mountjoy still, or it could not have been hiswhen he was allowed to borrow money upon it.""I cannot understand it. I thought it was entailed upon him. Of courseit is nothing to me. It never could have been anything.""But now the creditors declare that they have been cheated, and assertthat Mountjoy is being kept out of the way to aid old Mr. Scarborough inthe fraud. I cannot but say that I think it is so. But why he shouldhave attacked me just at the moment of his going, or why, rather, heshould have gone immediately after he had attacked me, I cannot say. Ihave no concern whatever with him or his money, though I hope--I hopethat I may always have much with you. Oh, Florence, you surely haveknown what has been within my heart."To this appeal she made no response, but sat awhile considering what shewould say respecting Mountjoy Scarborough and his affairs."Am I to keep all this a secret?" she asked him at last."You shall consider that for yourself. I have not exacted from you anysilence on the matter. You may tell whom you please, and I shall notconsider that I have any ground of complaint against you. Of course formy own sake I do not wish it to be told. A great injury was done me, andI do not desire to be dragged into this, which would be another injury.I suspect that Augustus Scarborough knows more than he pretends, and Ido not wish to be brought into the mess by his cunning. Whether you willtell your mother you must judge yourself.""I shall tell nobody unless you bid me." At that moment the door of theroom was opened, and Mrs. Mountjoy entered, with a frown upon her brow.She had not yet given up all hope that Mountjoy might return, and thatthe affairs of Tretton might be made to straighten themselves."Mamma, Mr. Annesley is here.""So I perceive, my dear.""I have come to your daughter to tell her how dearly I love her," saidHarry, boldly."Mr. Annesley, you should have come to me before speaking to mydaughter.""Then I shouldn't have seen her at all.""You should have left that as it might be. It is not at all a properthing that a young gentleman should come and address a young lady inthis way behind her only parent's back.""I asked for you, and I did not know that you would not be at home.""You should have gone away at once--at once. You know how terribly thefamily is cut up by this great misfortune to our cousin Mountjoy.Mountjoy Scarborough has been long engaged to Florence.""No, mamma; no, never.""At any rate, Mr. Annesley knows all about it. And that knowledge oughtto have kept him away at the present moment. I must beg him to leave usnow."Then Harry took his hat and departed; but he had great consolation infeeling that Florence had not repudiated his love, which she certainlywould have done had she not loved him in return. She had spoken no wordof absolute encouragement, but there had much more of encouragement thanof repudiation in her manner.CHAPTER VII.HARRY ANNESLEY GOES TO TRETTON.Harry had promised to go down to Tretton, and when the time cameAugustus Scarborough did not allow him to escape from the visit. Heexplained to him that in his father's state of health there would be nocompany to entertain him; that there was only a maiden sister of hisfather's staying in the house, and that he intended to take down intothe country with him one Septimus Jones, who occupied chambers on thesame floor with him in London, and whom Annesley knew to be youngScarborough's most intimate friend. "There will be a little shooting,"he said, "and I have bought two or three horses, which you and Jones canride. Cannock Chase is one of the prettiest parts of England, and as youcare for scenery you can get some amusement out of that. You'll see myfather, and hear, no doubt, what he has got to say for himself. He isnot in the least reticent in speaking of my brother's affairs." Therewas a good deal in this which was not agreeable. Miss Scarborough wassister to Mrs. Mountjoy as well as to the squire, and had been one ofthe family party most anxious to assure the marriage of Florence and thecaptain. The late General Mountjoy had been supposed to be a great manin his way, but had died before Tretton had become as valuable as it wasnow. Hence the eldest son had been christened with his name, and much ofthe Mountjoy prestige still clung to the family. But Harry did not caremuch about the family except so far as Florence was concerned. And thenhe had not been on peculiarly friendly terms with Septimus Jones, whohad always been submissive to Augustus; and, now that Augustus was arich man and could afford to buy horses, was likely to be moresubmissive than ever.He went down to Tretton alone early in September, and when he reachedthe house he found that the two young men were out shooting. He askedfor his own room, but was instead immediately taken to the old squire,whom he found lying on a couch in a small dressing-room, while hissister, who had been reading to him, was by his side. After the usualgreetings Harry made some awkward apology as to his intrusion at thesick man's bedside. "Why, I ordered them to bring you in here," said thesquire; "you can't very well call that intrusion. I have no idea ofbeing shut up from the world before they nail me down in my coffin.""That will be a long time first, we all hope," said his sister."Bother! you hope it, but I don't know that any one else does;--I don'tfor one. And if I did, what's the good of hoping? I have a couple ofdiseases, either of which is enough to kill a horse." Then he mentionedhis special maladies in a manner which made Harry shrink. "What are theytalking about in London just at present?" he asked."Just the old set of subjects," said Harry."I suppose they have got tired of me and my iniquities?" Harry couldonly smile and shake his head. "There has been such a complication ofromances that one expects the story to run a little more than theordinary nine days.""Men still do talk about Mountjoy.""And what are they saying? Augustus declares that you are especiallyinterested on the subject.""I don't know why I should be," said Harry."Nor I either. When a fellow becomes no longer of any service to eitherman, woman, or beast, I do not know why any should take an interest inhim. I suppose you didn't lend him money?""I was not likely to do that, sir.""Then I cannot conceive how it can interest you whether he be in Londonor Kamtchatka. It does not interest me the least in the world. Were heto turn up here it would be a trouble; and yet they expect me tosubscribe largely to a fund for finding him. What good could he do me ifhe were found?""Oh, John, he is your son," said Miss Scarborough."And would be just as good a son as Augustus, only that he has turnedout uncommonly badly. I have not the slightest feeling in the world asto his birth, and so I think I showed pretty plainly. But nothing couldstop him in his course, and therefore I told the truth, that's all." Inanswer to this, Harry found it quite impossible to say a word, but gotaway to his bedroom and dressed for dinner as quickly as possible.While he was still thus employed Augustus came into the room stilldressed in his shooting-clothes. "So you've seen my father," he said."Yes, I saw him.""And what did he say to you about Mountjoy?""Little or nothing that signifies. He seems to think it unreasonablethat he should be asked to pay for finding him, seeing that thecreditors expect to get the advantage of his presence when found.""He is about right there.""Oh yes; but still he is his father. It may be that it would be expectedthat he should interest himself in finding him.""Upon my word I don't agree with you. If a thousand a year could be paidto keep Mountjoy out of the way I think it would be well expended.""But you were acting with the police.""Oh, the police! What do the police know about it? Of course I talk itall over with them. They have not the smallest idea where the man is,and do not know how to go to work to discover him. I don't say that myfather is judicious in his brazen-faced opposition to all inquiry. Heshould pretend to be a little anxious--as I do. Not that there would beany use now in pretending to keep up appearances. He has declaredhimself utterly indifferent to the law, and has defied the world. Nevermind, old fellow, we shall eat the more dinner, only I must go andprepare myself for it."At dinner Harry found only Septimus Jones, Augustus Scarborough, and hisaunt. Miss Scarborough said a good deal about her brother, and declaredhim to be much better. "Of course you know, Augustus, that Sir WilliamBrodrick was down here for two days.""Only fancy," replied he, "what one has to pay for two days of SirWilliam Brodrick in the country!""What can it matter?" said the generous spinster."It matters exactly so many hundred pounds; but no one will begrudge itif he does so many hundred pounds' worth of good.""It will show, at any rate, that we have had the best advice," said thelady."Yes, it will show;--that is exactly what people care about. What did SirWilliam say?" Then during the first half of dinner a prolonged referencewas made to Mr. Scarborough's maladies, and to Sir William's opinionconcerning them. Sir William had declared that Mr. Scarborough'sconstitution was the most wonderful thing that he had ever met in hisexperience. In spite of the fact that Mr. Scarborough's body was onemass of cuts and bruises and faulty places, and that nothing would keephim going except the wearing of machinery which he was unwilling towear, yet the facilities for much personal enjoyment were left to him,and Sir William declared that, if he would only do exactly as he weretold, he might live for the next five years. "But everybody knows thathe won't do anything that he is told," said Augustus, in a tone of voicewhich by no means expressed extreme sorrow.From his father he led the conversation to the partridges, and declaredhis conviction that, with a little trouble and some expense, a very goodhead of game might be got up at Tretton. "I suppose it wouldn't costmuch?" said Jones, who beyond ten shillings to a game-keeper never paidsixpence for whatever shooting came in his way."I don't know what you call much," said Augustus, "but I think it may bedone for three or four hundred a year. I should like to calculate howmany thousand partridges at that rate Sir William has taken back in hispocket.""What does it matter?" asked Miss Scarborough."Only as a speculation. Of course my father, while he lives, isjustified in giving his whole income to doctors if he likes it; but onegets into a manner of speaking about him as though he had done a gooddeal with his money in which he was not justified.""Don't talk in that way, Augustus.""My dear aunt, I am not at all inclined to be more open-mouthed than heis. Only reflect what it was that he was disposed to do with me, andthe good-humor with which I have borne it!""I think I should hold my tongue about it," said Harry Annesley."And I think that in my place you would do no such thing. To your natureit would be almost impossible to hold your tongue. Your sense of justicewould be so affronted that you would feel yourself compelled to discussthe injury done to you with all your intimate friends. But with yourfather your quarrel would be eternal. I made nothing of it, and, indeed,if he pertinaciously held his tongue on the subject, so should I.""But because he talks," said Harry, "why should you?""Why should he not?" said Septimus Jones. "Upon my word I don't see thejustice of it.""I am not speaking of justice, but of feeling.""Upon my word I wish you would hold your tongues about it; at any ratetill my back is turned," said the old lady.Then Augustus finished the conversation. "I am determined to treat itall as though it were a joke, and, as a joke, one to be spoken oflightly. It was a strong measure, certainly, this attempt to rob me oftwenty or thirty thousand pounds a year. But it was done in favor of mybrother, and therefore let it pass. I am at a loss to conceive what myfather has done with his money. He hasn't given Mountjoy, at any rate,more than a half of his income for the last five or six years, and hisown personal expenses are very small. Yet he tells me that he has thegreatest difficulty in raising a thousand pounds, and positively refusesin his present difficulties to add above five hundred a year to myformer allowance. No father who had thoroughly done his duty by his son,could speak in a more fixed and austere manner. And yet he knows thatevery shilling will be mine as soon as he goes." The servant who waswaiting upon them had been in and out of the room while this was said,and must have heard much of it. But to that Augustus seemed to be quiteindifferent. And, indeed, the whole family story was known to everyservant in the house. It is true that gentlemen and ladies who haveservants do not usually wish to talk about their private matters beforeall the household, even though the private matters may be known; butthis household was unlike all others in that respect. There was not ahousemaid about the rooms or a groom in the stables who did not know howterrible a reprobate their master had been."You will see your father before you go to bed?" Miss Scarborough saidto her nephew as she left the room."Certainly, if he will send to say that he wishes it.""He does wish it, most anxiously.""I believe that to be your imagination. At any rate, I will come--say inan hour's time. He would be just as pleased to see Harry Annesley, forthe matter of that, or Mr. Grey, or the inspector of police. Any onewhom he could shock, or pretend to shock, by the peculiarity of hisopinions, would do as well." By that time, however, Miss Scarborough hadleft the room.Then the three men sat and talked, and discussed the affairs of thefamily generally. New leases had just been granted for addingmanufactories to the town of Tretton: and as far as outward marks ofprosperity went all was prosperous. "I expect to have a water-mill onthe lawn before long," said Augustus. "These mechanics have it all theirown way. If they were to come and tell me that they intended to put up awind-mill in my bedroom to-morrow morning, I could only take off my hatto them. When a man offers you five per cent. where you've only hadfour, he is instantly your lord and master. It doesn't signify howvulgar he is, or how insolent, or how exacting. Associations of thetenderest kind must all give way to trade. But the shooting which liesto the north and west of us is, I think, safe for the present. I supposeI must go and see what my father wants, or I shall be held to haveneglected my duty to my affectionate parent.""Capital fellow, Augustus Scarborough," said Jones, as soon as theirhost had left them."I was at Cambridge with him, and he was popular there.""He'll be more popular now that he's the heir to Tretton. I don't knowany fellow that I can get along better with than Scarborough. I thinkyou were a little hard upon him about his father, you know.""In his position he ought to hold his tongue.""It's the strangest thing that has turned up in the whole course of myexperience. You see, if he didn't talk about it people wouldn't quiteunderstand what it was that his father has done. It's only matter ofreport now, and the creditors, no doubt, do believe that when oldScarborough goes off the hooks they will be able to walk in and takepossession. He has got to make the world think that he is the heir, andthat will go a long way. You may be sure he doesn't talk as he doeswithout having a reason for it. He's the last man I know to do anythingwithout a reason."The evening dragged along very slowly while Jones continued to tell allthat he knew of his friend's character. But Augustus Scarborough did notreturn, and soon after ten o'clock, when Harry Annesley could smoke nomore cigars, and declared that he had no wish to begin uponbrandy-and-water after his wine, he went to his bed.CHAPTER VIII.HARRY ANNESLEY TAKES A WALK."There was the devil to pay with my father last night after I went tohim," said Scarborough to Harry next morning. "He now and then suffersagonies of pain, and it is the most difficult thing in the world to gethim right again. But anything equal to his courage I never before met.""How is he this morning?""Very weak and unable to exert himself. But I cannot say that he isotherwise much the worse. You won't see him this morning; but to-morrowyou will, or next day. Don't you be shy about going to him when he sendsfor you. He likes to show the world that he can bear his sufferings witha light heart, and is ready to die to-morrow without a pang or a regret.Who was the fellow who sent for a fellow to let him see how a Christiancould die? I can fancy my father doing the same thing, only there wouldbe nothing about Christianity in the message. He would bid you come andsee a pagan depart in peace, and would be very unhappy if he thoughtthat your dinner would be disturbed by the ceremony. Now come down tobreakfast, and then we'll go out shooting."For three days Harry remained at Tretton, and ate and drank, and shotand rode, always in young Scarborough's company. During this time he didnot see the old squire, and understood from Miss Scarborough's absencethat he was still suffering from his late attack. The visit was to beprolonged for one other day, and he was told that on that day the squirewould send for him. "I'm sick of these eternal partridges," saidAugustus. "No man should ever shoot partridges two days running. Jonescan go out by himself. He won't have to tip the game-keeper any more foran additional day, and so it will be all gain to him. You'll see myfather in the afternoon after lunch, and we will go and take a walknow."Harry started for his walk, and his companion immediately began againabout the property. "I'm beginning to think," said he, "that it's nearlyall up with the governor. These attacks come upon him worse and worse,and always leave him absolutely prostrate. Then he will do nothing toprevent them. To assure himself a week of life, he will not endure anhour of discomfort. It is plucky, you know.""He is in all respects as brave a man as I have known.""He sets God and man at absolute defiance, and always does it with themost profound courtesy. If he goes to the infernal regions he willinsist upon being the last of the company to enter the door. And he willbe prepared with something good-humored to say as soon as he has beenushered in. He was very much troubled about you yesterday.""What has he to say of me?""Nothing in the least uncivil; but he has an idea in his head whichnothing on earth will put out of it, and in which, but for your ownword, I should be inclined to agree." Harry, when this was said, stoodstill on the mountain-side, and looked full into his companion's face.He felt at the moment that the idea had some reference to MountjoyScarborough and his disappearance. They were together on the heathy,unenclosed ground of Cannock Chase, and had already walked some ten ortwelve miles. "He thinks you know where Mountjoy is.""Why should I know?""Or at any rate that you have seen him since any of us. He professes notto care a straw for Mountjoy or his whereabouts, and declares himselfunder obligation to those who have contrived his departure.Nevertheless, he is curious.""What have I to do with Mountjoy Scarborough?""That's just the question. What have you to do with him? He suggeststhat there have been words between you as to Florence, which has causedMountjoy to vanish. I don't profess to explain anything beyondthat,--nor, indeed, do I profess to agree with my father. But the oddthing is that Prodgers, the policeman, has the same thing running in hishead.""Because I have shown some anxiety about your brother in Scotland Yard.""No doubt; Prodgers says that you've shown more anxiety than was to beexpected from a mere acquaintance. I quite acknowledge that Prodgers isas thick-headed an idiot as you shall catch on a summer's day; butthat's his opinion. For myself, I know your word too well to doubt it."Harry walked on in silence, thinking, or trying to think, what, on thespur of the moment, he had better do. He was minded to speak out thewhole truth, and declare to himself that it was nothing to him whatAugustus Scarborough might say or think. And there was present to him afeeling that his companion was dealing unfairly with him, and wasendeavoring in some way to trap him and lead him into a difficulty. Buthe had made up his mind, as it were, not to know anything of MountjoyScarborough, and to let those five minutes in the street be as thoughthey had never been. He had been brutally attacked, and had thought itbest to say nothing on the subject. He would not allow his secret, suchas it was, to be wormed out of him. Scarborough was endeavoring toextort from him that which he had resolved to conceal; and he determinedat last that he would not become a puppet in his hands. "I don't see whyyou should care a straw about it," said Scarborough."Nor do I.""At any rate you repeat your denial. It will be well that I should letmy father know that he is mistaken, and also that ass Prodgers. Ofcourse, with my father it is sheer curiosity. Indeed, if he thought thatyou were keeping Mountjoy under lock and key, he would only admire yourdexterity in so preserving him. Any bold line of action that wascontrary to the law recommends itself to his approbation. But Prodgershas a lurking idea that he should like to arrest you.""What for?""Simply because he thinks you know something that he doesn't know. Ashe's a detective, that, in his mind, is quite enough for arresting anyman. I may as well give him my assurance, then, that he is mistaken.""Why should your assurance go for more than mine? Give him nothing ofthe kind.""I may give him, at any rate, my assurance that I believe your word.""If you do believe it, you can do so.""But you repeat your assertion that you saw nothing of Mountjoy justbefore his disappearance?""This is an amount of cross-questioning which I do not take in goodpart, and to which I will not submit." Here Scarborough affected tolaugh loudly. "I know nothing of your brother, and care almost aslittle. He has professed to admire a young lady to whom I am notindifferent, and has, I believe, expressed a wish to make her his wife.He is also her cousin, and the lady in question has, no doubt, been muchinterested about him. It is natural that she should be so.""Quite natural--seeing that she has been engaged to him for twelvemonths.""Of that I know nothing. But my interest about your brother has beenbecause of her. You can explain all this about your brother if youplease, or can let it alone. But for myself, I decline to answer anymore questions. If Prodgers thinks that he can arrest me, let him comeand try.""The idea of your flying into a passion because I have endeavored toexplain it all to you! At any rate I have your absolute denial, and thatwill enable me to deal both with my father and Prodgers." To this Harrymade no answer, and the two young men walked back to Tretton togetherwithout many more words between them.When Harry had been in the house about half an hour, and had alreadyeaten his lunch, somewhat sulkily, a message came to him from MissScarborough requiring his presence. He went to her, and was told by herthat Mr. Scarborough would now see him. He was aware that Mr.Scarborough never saw Septimus Jones, and that there was somethingpeculiar in the sending of this message to him. Why should the man whowas supposed to have but a few weeks to live be so anxious to see onewho was comparatively a stranger to him? "I am so glad you have come inbefore dinner, Mr. Annesley, because my brother is so anxious to seeyou, and I am afraid you'll go too early in the morning." Then hefollowed her, and again found Mr. Scarborough on a couch in the sameroom to which he had been first introduced."I've had a sharp bout of it since I saw you before," said the sick man."So we heard, sir.""There is no saying how many or rather how few bouts of this kind itwill take to polish me off. But I think I am entitled to some littlerespite now. The apothecary from Tretton was here this morning, and Ibelieve has done me just as much good as Sir William Brodrick. Hischarge will be ten shillings, while Sir William demanded three hundredpounds. But it would be mean to go out with no one but the Trettonapothecary to look after one.""I suppose Sir William's knowledge has been of some service.""His dexterity with his knife has been of more. So you and Augustus havebeen quarrelling about Mountjoy?""Not that I know of.""He says so; and I believe his word on such a subject sooner than yours.You are likely to quarrel without knowing it, and he is not. He thinksthat you know what has become of Mountjoy.""Does he? Why should he think so, when I told him that I know nothing? Itell you that I know absolutely nothing. I am ignorant whether he isdead or alive.""He is not dead," said the father."I suppose not; but I know nothing about him. Why your second son--""You mean my eldest according to law,--or rather my only son!""Why Augustus Scarborough," continued Harry Annesley, "should take uponhimself to suspect that I know aught of his brother I cannot say. He hassome cock-and-bull story about a policeman whom he professes to believeto be ignorant of his own business. This policeman, he says, is anxiousto arrest me.""To make you give evidence before a magistrate," said his father."He did not dare to tell me that he suspected me himself.""There;--I knew you had quarrelled.""I deny it altogether. I have not quarrelled with Augustus Scarborough.He is welcome to his suspicions if he chooses to entertain them. Ishould have liked him better if he had not brought me down to Tretton,so as to extract from me whatever he can. I shall be more guarded infuture in speaking of Mountjoy Scarborough; but to you I give mypositive assurance, which I do not doubt you will believe, that I knownothing respecting him." An honest indignation gleamed in his eyes as hespoke; but still there were the signs of that vacillation about hismouth which Florence had been able to read, but not to interpret."Yes," said the squire, after a pause, "I believe you. You haven't thatkind of ingenuity which enables a man to tell a lie and stick to it. Ihave. It's a very great gift if a man be enabled to restrain hisappetite for lying." Harry could only smile when he heard the squire'sconfession. "Only think how I have lied about Mountjoy; and howsuccessful my lies might have been, but for his own folly!""People do judge you a little harshly now," said Harry."What's the odd's? I care nothing for their judgment; I endeavored to dojustice to my own child, and very nearly did it. I was very nearlysuccessful in rectifying the gross injustice of the world. Why should alittle delay in a ceremony in which he had no voice have robbed him ofhis possessions? I determined that he should have Tretton, and Idetermined also to make it up to Augustus by denying myself the use ofmy own wealth. Things have gone wrongly not by my own folly. I could notprevent the mad career which Mountjoy has run; but do you think that Iam ashamed because the world knows what I have done? Do you suppose mydeath-bed will be embittered by the remembrance that I have been a liar?Not in the least. I have done the best I could for my two sons, and indoing it have denied myself many advantages. How many a man would havespent his money on himself, thinking nothing of his boys, and then havegone to his grave with all the dignity of a steady Christian father! Ofthe two men I prefer myself; but I know that I have been a liar."What was Harry Annesley to say in answer to such an address as this?There was the man, stretched on his bed before him, haggard, unshaved,pale, and grizzly, with a fire in his eyes, but weakness in hisvoice,--bold, defiant, self-satisfied, and yet not selfish. He had livedthrough his life with the one strong resolution of setting the law atdefiance in reference to the distribution of his property; but chieflybecause he had thought the law to be unjust. Then, when the accident ofhis eldest son's extravagance had fallen upon him, he had endeavored tosave his second son, and had thought, without the slightest remorse, ofthe loss which was to fall on the creditors. He had done all this insuch a manner that, as far as Harry knew, the law could not touch him,though all the world was aware of his iniquity. And now he lay boastingof what he had done. It was necessary that Harry should say something ashe rose from his seat, and he lamely expressed a wish that Mr.Scarborough might quickly recover. "No, my dear fellow," said thesquire; "men do not recover when they are brought to such straits as Iam in. Nor do I wish it. Were I to live, Augustus would feel the secondinjustice to be quite intolerable. His mind is lost in amazement at whatI had contemplated. And he feels that the matter can only be set rightbetween him and fortune by my dying at once. If he were to understandthat I were to live ten years longer, I think that he would eithercommit a murder or lose his senses.""But there is enough for both of you," said Harry."There is no such word in the language as enough. An estate can have butone owner, and Augustus is anxious to be owner here. I do not blame himin the least. Why should he desire to spare a father's rights when thatfather showed himself so willing to sacrifice his? Good-bye, Annesley; Iam sorry you are going, for I like to have some honest fellow to talkto. You are not to suppose that because I have done this thing I amindifferent to what men shall say of me. I wish them to think me good,though I have chosen to run counter to the prejudices of the world."Then Harry escaped from the room, and spent the remaining evening withAugustus Scarborough and Septimus Jones. The conversation was devotedchiefly to the partridges and horses; and was carried on by Septimuswith severity toward Harry, and by Scarborough with an extreme civilitywhich was the more galling of the two.CHAPTER IX.AUGUSTUS HAS HIS OWN DOUBTS."That's an impertinent young puppy," said Septimus Jones as soon as thefly which was to carry Harry Annesley to the station had left thehall-door on the following morning. It may be presumed that Mr. Joneswould not thus have expressed himself unless his friend AugustusScarborough had dropped certain words in conversation in regard to Harryto the same effect. And it may be presumed also that Augustus would nothave dropped such words without a purpose of letting his friend knowthat Harry was to be abused. Augustus Scarborough had made up his mind,looking at the matter all round, that more was to be got by abusingHarry than by praising him."The young man has a good opinion of himself certainly.""He thinks himself to be a deal better than anybody else," continuedJones, "whereas I for one don't see it. And he has a way with him ofpretending to be quite equal to his companions, let them be who theymay, which to me is odious. He was down upon you and down upon yourfather. Of course your father has made a most fraudulent attempt; butwhat the devil is it to him?" The other young man made no answer, butonly smiled. The opinion expressed by Mr. Jones as to Harry Annesley hadonly been a reflex of that felt by Augustus Scarborough. But the reflex,as is always the case when the looking-glass is true, was correct.Scarborough had known Harry Annesley for a long time, as time is countedin early youth, and had by degrees learned to hate him thoroughly. Hewas a little the elder, and had at first thought to domineer over hisfriend. But the friend had resisted, and had struggled manfully toachieve what he considered an equality in friendship. "Now, Scarborough,you may as well take it once for all that I am not going to be talkeddown. If you want to talk a fellow down you can go to Walker, Brown, orGreen. Then when you are tired of the occupation you can come back tome." It was thus that Annesley had been wont to address his friend. Buthis friend had been anxious to talk down this special young man forspecial purposes, and had been conscious of some weakness in the other'scharacter which he thought entitled him to do so. But the weakness wasnot of that nature, and he had failed. Then had come the rivalry betweenMountjoy and Harry, which had seemed to Augustus to be the extreme ofimpudence. From of old he had been taught to regard his brother Mountjoyas the first of young men--among commoners; the first in prospects andthe first in rank; and to him Florence Mountjoy had been allotted as abride. How he had himself learned first to envy and then to covet thisallotted bride need not here be told. But by degrees it had come to passthat Augustus had determined that his spendthrift brother should fallunder his own power, and that the bride should be the reward. How it wasthat two brothers, so different in character, and yet so alike in theirselfishness, should have come to love the same girl with a trueintensity of purpose, and that Harry Annesley, whose character wasessentially different, and who was in no degree selfish, should haveloved her also, must be left to explain itself as the girl's charactershall be developed. But Florence Mountjoy had now for many months beenthe cause of bitter dislike against poor Harry in the mind of AugustusScarborough. He understood much more clearly than his brother had donewho it was that the girl really preferred. He was ever conscious, too,of his own superiority,--falsely conscious,--and did feel that if Harry'scharacter were really known, no girl would in truth prefer him. Hecould not quite see Harry with Florence's eyes nor could he see himselfwith any other eyes but his own.Then had come the meeting between Mountjoy and Harry Annesley in thestreet, of which he had only such garbled account as Mountjoy himselfhad given him within half an hour afterward. From that story, told inthe words of a drunken man,--a man drunk, and bruised, and bloody, whoclearly did not understand in one minute the words spoken in thelast,--Augustus did learn that there had been some great row between hisbrother and Harry Annesley. Then Mountjoy had disappeared,--haddisappeared, as the reader will have understood, with his brother'sco-operation,--and Harry had not come forward, when inquiries were made,to declare what he knew of the occurrences of that night. Augustus hadnarrowly watched his conduct, in order at first that he might learn inwhat condition his brother had been left in the street, but afterwardwith the purpose of ascertaining why it was that Harry had been soreticent. Then he had allured Harry on to a direct lie, and soonperceived that he could afterward use the secret for his own purpose."I think we shall have to see what that young man's about, you know," hesaid afterward to Septimus Jones."Yes, yes, certainly," said Septimus. But Septimus did not quiteunderstand why it was that they should have to see what the young manwas about."Between you and me, I think he means to interfere with me, and I do notmean to stand his interference.""I should think not.""He must go back to Buston, among the Bustonians, or he and I will havea stand-up fight of it. I rather like a stand-up fight.""Just so. When a fellow's so bumptious as that he ought to be licked.""He has lied about Mountjoy," said Augustus. Then Jones waited to betold how it was that Harry had lied. He was aware that there was somesecret unknown to him, and was anxious to be informed. Was Harry awareof Mountjoy's hiding-place, and if so, how had he learned it? Why was itthat Harry should be acquainted with that which was dark to all theworld besides? Jones was of opinion that the squire knew all about it,and thought it not improbable that the squire and Augustus had thesecret in their joint keeping. But if so, how should Harry Annesley knowanything about it? "He has lied like the very devil," continuedAugustus, after a pause."Has he, now?""And I don't mean to spare him.""I should think not." Then there was a pause, at the end of which Jonesfound himself driven to ask a question: "How has he lied?" Augustussmiled and shook his head, from which the other man gathered that he wasnot now to be told the nature of the lie in question. "A fellow thatlies like that," said Jones, "is not to be endured.""I do not mean to endure him. You have heard of a young lady named MissMountjoy, a cousin of ours?""Mountjoy's Miss Mountjoy?" suggested Jones."Yes, Mountjoy's Miss Mountjoy. That, of course, is over. Mountjoy hasbrought himself to such a pass that he is not entitled to have a MissMountjoy any longer. It seems the proper thing that she shall pass, withthe rest of the family property, to the true heir.""You marry her!""We need not talk about that just at present. I don't know that I'vemade up my mind. At any rate, I do not intend that Harry Annesley shallhave her.""I should think not.""He's a pestilential cur, that has got himself introduced into thefamily, and the sooner we get quit of him the better. I should think theyoung lady would hardly fancy him when she knows that he has lied likethe very devil, with the object of getting her former lover out of theway.""By Jove, no, I should think not!""And when the world comes to understand that Harry Annesley, in themidst of all these inquiries, knows all about poor Mountjoy,--was thelast to see him in London,--and has never come forward to say a wordabout him, then I think the world will be a little hard upon theimmaculate Harry Annesley. His own uncle has quarrelled with himalready.""What uncle?""The gentleman down in Hertfordshire, on the strength of whose acresMaster Harry is flaunting it about in idleness. I have my eyes open andcan see as well as another. When Harry lectures me about my father andmy father about me, one would suppose that there's not a hole in his owncoat. I think he'll find that the garment is not altogetherwater-tight." Then Augustus, finding that he had told as much as wasneedful to Septimus Jones, left his friend and went about his own familybusiness.On the next morning Septimus Jones took his departure, and on the dayfollowing Augustus followed him. "So you're off?" his father said tohim when he came to make his adieux."Well, yes; I suppose so. A man has got so many things to look afterwhich he can't attend to down here.""I don't know what they are, but you understand it all. I'm not going toask you to stay. Does it ever occur to you that you may never see meagain?""What a question!""It's one that requires an answer, at any rate.""It does occur to me; but not at all as probable.""Why not probable?""Because there's a telegraph wire from Tretton to London; and becausethe journey down here is very short. It also occurs to me to think sofrom what has been said by Sir William Brodrick. Of course any man maydie suddenly.""Especially when the surgeons have been at him.""You have your sister with you, sir, and she will be of more comfort toyou than I can be. Your condition is in some respects an advantage toyou. These creditors of Mountjoy can't force their way in upon you.""You are wrong there.""They have not done so.""Nor should they, though I were as strong as you. What are Mountjoy'screditors to me? They have not a scrap of my handwriting in theirpossession. There is not one who can say that he has even a verbalpromise from me. They never came to me when they wanted to lend himmoney at fifty per cent. Did they ever hear me say that he was my heir?""Perhaps not.""Not one has ever heard it. It was not to them I lied, but to you and toGrey. D---- the creditors! What do I care for them, though they be allruined?""Not in the least.""Why do you talk to me about the creditors? You, at any rate, know thetruth." Then Augustus quitted the room, leaving his father in a passion.But, as a fact, he was by no means assured as to the truth. He supposedthat he was the heir; but might it not be possible that his father hadcontrived all this so as to save the property from Mountjoy and thatgreedy pack of money-lenders? Grey must surely know the truth. But whyshould not Grey be deceived on the second event as well as the first.There was no limit, Augustus sometimes thought, to his father'scleverness. This idea had occurred to him within the last week, and hismind was tormented with reflecting what might yet be his condition. Butof one thing he was sure, that his father and Mountjoy were not inleague together. Mountjoy at any rate believed himself to have beendisinherited. Mountjoy conceived that his only chance of obtaining moneyarose from his brother. The circumstances of Mountjoy's absence were, atany rate, unknown to his father.CHAPTER X.SIR MAGNUS MOUNTJOY.It was the peculiarity of Florence Mountjoy that she did not expectother people to be as good as herself. It was not that she erected forherself a high standard and had then told herself that she had no rightto demand from others one so exalted. She had erected nothing. Nor didshe know that she attempted to live by grand rules. She had no idea thatshe was better than anybody else; but it came to her naturally as theresult of what had gone before, to be unselfish, generous, trusting, andpure. These may be regarded as feminine virtues, and may be said to besometimes tarnished, by faults which are equally feminine. Unselfishnessmay become want of character; generosity essentially unjust; confidencemay be weak, and purity insipid. Here it was that the strength ofFlorence Mountjoy asserted itself. She knew well what was due toherself, though she would not claim it. She could trust to another, butin silence be quite sure of herself. Though pure herself, she was rarelyshocked by the ways of others. And she was as true as a man pretends tobe.In figure, form, and face she never demanded immediate homage by thesudden flash of her beauty. But when her spell had once fallen on aman's spirit it was not often that he could escape from it quickly. Whenshe spoke a peculiar melody struck the hearer's ears. Her voice was softand low and sweet, and full at all times of harmonious words; but whenshe laughed it was like soft winds playing among countless silver bells.There was something in her touch which to men was almost divine. Of thisshe was all unconscious, but was as chary with her fingers as though itseemed that she could ill spare her divinity.In height she was a little above the common, but it was by the grace ofher movements that the world was compelled to observe her figure. Thereare women whose grace is so remarkable as to demand the attention ofall. But then it is known of them, and momentarily seen, that theirgrace is peculiar. They have studied their graces, and the result isthere only too evident. But Florence seemed to have studied nothing. Thebeholder felt that she must have been as graceful when playing with herdoll in the nursery. And it was the same with her beauty. There was nopeculiarity of chiselled features. Had you taken her face and measuredit by certain rules, you would have found that her mouth was too largeand her nose irregular. Of her teeth she showed but little, and in hercomplexion there was none of that pellucid clearness in which menordinarily delight. But her eyes were more than ordinarily bright, andwhen she laughed there seemed to stream from them some heavenly delight.When she did laugh it was as though some spring had been opened fromwhich ran for the time a stream of sweetest intimacy. For the time youwould then fancy that you had been let into the inner life of this girl,and would be proud of yourself that so much should have been grantedyou. You would feel that there was something also in yourself in thatthis should have been permitted. Her hair and eyebrows were dark brown,of the hue most common to men and women, and had in them nothing thatwas peculiar; but her hair was soft and smooth and ever well dressed,and never redolent of peculiar odors. It was simply Florence Mountjoy'shair, and that made it perfect in the eyes of her male friendsgenerally."She's not such a wonderful beauty, after all," once said of her agentleman to whom it may be presumed that she had not taken the troubleto be peculiarly attractive. "No," said another,--"no. But, by George! Ishouldn't like to have the altering of her." It was thus that mengenerally felt in regard to Florence Mountjoy. When they came to reckonher up they did not see how any change was to be made for the better.To Florence, as to most other girls, the question of her future life hadbeen a great trouble. Whom should she marry? and whom should she declineto marry? To a girl, when it is proposed to her suddenly to changeeverything in life, to go altogether away and place herself under thecustody of a new master, to find for herself a new home, new pursuits,new aspirations, and a strange companion, the change must be socomplete as almost to frighten her by its awfulness. And yet it has tobe always thought of, and generally done.But this change had been presented to Florence in a manner more thanordinarily burdensome. Early in life, when naturally she would not havebegun to think seriously of marriage, she had been told rather thanasked to give herself to her cousin Mountjoy. She was too firm ofcharacter to accede at once--to deliver herself over body and soul tothe tender mercies of one, in truth, unknown. But she had been unable tointerpose any reason that was valid, and had contented herself bydemanding time. Since that there had been moments in which she hadalmost yielded. Mountjoy Scarborough had been so represented to her thatshe had considered it to be almost a duty to yield. More than once theword had been all but spoken; but the word had never been spoken. Shehad been subjected to what might be called cruel pressure. In season andout of season her mother had represented as a duty this marriage withher cousin. Why should she not marry her cousin? It must be understoodthat these questions had been asked before any of the terrible facts ofCaptain Scarborough's life had been made known to her. Because, it maybe said, she did not love him. But in these days she had loved no man,and was inclined to think so little of herself as to make her want oflove no necessary bar to the accomplishment of the wish of others. Bydegrees she was spoken of among their acquaintance as the promised brideof Mountjoy Scarborough, and though she ever denied the imputation,there came over her girl's heart a feeling,--very sad and very solemn,but still all but accepted,--that so it must be. Then Harry Annesley hadcrossed her path, and the question had been at last nearly answered, andthe doubts nearly decided. She did not quite know at first that sheloved Harry Annesley, but was almost sure that it was impossible for herto become the wife of Mountjoy Scarborough.Then there came nearly twelve months of most painful uncertainty in herlife. It is very hard for a young girl to have to be firm with hermother in declining a proposed marriage, when all circumstances of theconnection are recommended to her as being peculiarly alluring. Andthere was nothing in the personal manners of her cousin which seemed tojustify her in declaring her abhorrence. He was a dark, handsome,military-looking man, whose chief sin it was in the eyes of his cousinthat he seemed to demand from her affection, worship, and obedience. Shedid not analyse his character, but she felt it. And when it came topass that tidings of his debts at last reached her, she felt that shewas glad of an excuse, though she knew that the excuse would not haveprevailed with her had she liked him. Then came his debts, and with theknowledge of them a keener perception of his imperiousness. She couldconsent to become the wife of the man who had squandered his propertyand wasted his estate; but not of one who before his marriage demandedof her that submission which, as she thought, should be given by herfreely after her marriage. Harry Annesley glided into her heart after amanner very different from this. She knew that he adored her, but yet hedid not hasten to tell her so. She knew that she loved him, but shedoubted whether a time would ever come in which she could confess it. Itwas not till he had come to acknowledge the trouble to which Mountjoyhad subjected him that he had ever ventured to speak plainly of his ownpassion, and even then he had not asked for a reply. She was still free,as she thought of all this, but she did at last tell herself that, lether mother say what she would, she certainly never would stand at thealtar with her cousin Mountjoy.Even now, when the captain had been declared not to be his father'sheir, and when all the world knew that he had disappeared from the faceof the earth, Mrs. Mountjoy did not altogether give him up. She partlydisbelieved her brother, and partly thought that circumstances could notbe so bad as they were described.To her feminine mind,--to her, living, not in the world of London, but inthe very moderate fashion of Cheltenham,--it seemed to be impossible thatan entail should be thus blighted in the bud. Why was an entail calledan entail unless it were ineradicable,--a decision of fate rather than ofman and of law? And to her eyes Mountjoy Scarborough was so commandingthat all things must at last be compelled to go as he would have them.And, to tell the truth, there had lately come to Mrs. Mountjoy a word ofcomfort, which might be necessary if the world should be absolutelyupset in accordance with the wicked skill of her brother, which even inthat case might make crooked things smooth. Augustus, whom she hadregarded always as quite a Mountjoy, because of his talent, andappearance, and habit of command, had whispered to her a word. Whyshould not Florence be transferred with the remainder of the property?There was something to Mrs. Mountjoy's feelings base in the idea at thefirst blush of it. She did not like to be untrue to her gallant nephew.But as she came to turn it in her mind there were certain circumstanceswhich recommended the change to her--should the change be necessary.Florence certainly had expressed an unintelligible objection to theelder brother. Why should the younger not be more successful? Mrs.Mountjoy's heart had begun to droop within her as she had thought thather girl would prove deaf to the voice of the charmer. Another charmerhad come, most objectionable in her sight, but to him no word ofabsolute encouragement had, as she thought, been yet spoken. Augustushad already obtained for himself among his friends the character of aneloquent young lawyer. Let him come and try his eloquence on hiscousin,--only let it first be ascertained, as an assured fact, and beyondthe possibility of all retrogression, that the squire's villainy wascertain."I think, my love," she said to her daughter one day, "that, under theimmediate circumstances of the family, we should retire for a while intoprivate life." This occurred on the very day on which Septimus Jones hadbeen vaguely informed of the iniquitous falsehood of Harry Annesley."Good gracious, mamma, is not our life always private?" She hadunderstood it all,--that the private life was intended altogether toexclude Harry, but was to be made open to the manoeuvres of her cousin,such as they might be."Not in the sense in which I mean. Your poor uncle is dying.""We hear that Sir William says he is better.""I fear, nevertheless, that he is dying,--though it may, perhaps, take along time. And then poor Mountjoy has disappeared. I think that weshould see no one till the mystery about Mountjoy has been cleared up.And then the story is so very discreditable.""I do not see that that is an affair of ours," said Florence, who had nodesire to be shut up just at the present moment."We cannot help ourselves. This making his eldest son out to be--oh,something so very different--is too horrible to be thought of. I am toldthat nobody knows the truth.""We at any rate are not implicated in that.""But we are. He at any rate is my brother, and Mountjoy is my nephew,--orat any rate was. Poor Augustus is thrown into terrible difficulties.""I am told that he is greatly pleased at finding that Tretton is tobelong to him.""Who tells you that? You have no right to believe anything about suchnear relatives from any one. Whoever told you so has been very wicked."Mrs. Mountjoy no doubt thought that this wicked communication had beenmade by Harry Annesley. "Augustus has always proved himself to beaffectionate and respectful to his elder brother, that is, to hisbrother who is--is older than himself," added Mrs. Mountjoy, feelingthat there was a difficulty in expressing herself as to the presumedcondition of the two Scarboroughs, "Of course he would rather be ownerof Tretton than let any one else have it, if you mean that. The honor ofthe family is very much to him.""I do not know that the family can have any honor left," said Florence,severely."My dear, you have no right to say that. The Scarboroughs have alwaysheld their heads very high in Staffordshire, and more so of late thanever. I don't mean quite of late, but since Tretton became of so muchimportance. Now, I'll tell you what I think we had better do. We'll goand spend six weeks with your uncle at Brussels. He has always beenpressing us to come.""Oh, mamma, he does not want us.""How can you say that? How do you know?""I am sure Sir Magnus will not care for our coming now. Besides, howcould that be retiring into private life? Sir Magnus, as ambassador, hashis house always full of company.""My dear, he is not ambassador. He is minister plenipotentiary. It isnot quite the same thing. And then he is our nearest relative,--ournearest, at least, since my own brother has made this great separation,of course. We cannot go to him to be out of the way of himself.""Why do you want to go anywhere, mamma? Why not stay at home?" ButFlorence pleaded in vain as her mother had already made up her mind.Before that day was over she succeeded in making her daughter understandthat she was to be taken to Brussels as soon as an answer could bereceived from Sir Magnus and the necessary additions were made to theirjoint wardrobe.Sir Magnus Mountjoy, the late general's elder brother, had been for thelast four or five years the English minister at Brussels. He had beenminister somewhere for a very long time, so that the memory of manhardly ran back beyond it, and was said to have gained for himself veryextensive popularity. It had always been a point with successivegovernments to see that poor Sir Magnus got something, and Sir Magnushad never been left altogether in the cold. He was not a man who wouldhave been left out in the cold in silence, and perhaps the feeling thatsuch was the case had been as efficacious on his behalf as hiswell-attested popularity. At any rate, poor Sir Magnus had always beenwell placed, and was now working out his last year or two before theblessed achievement of his pursuit should have been reached. Sir Magnushad a wife of whom it was said at home that she was almost as popular asher husband; but the opinion of the world at Brussels on this subjectwas a good deal divided. There were those who declared that LadyMountjoy was of all women the most overbearing and impertinent. But theywere generally English residents at Brussels, who had come to live thereas a place at which education for their children would be cheaper thanat home. Of these Lady Mountjoy had been heard to declare that she sawno reason why, because she was the minister's wife, she should beexpected to entertain all the second-class world of London. This, ofcourse, must be understood with a good deal of allowance, as the Englishworld at Brussels was much too large to expect to be so received; butthere were certain ladies living on the confines of high society whothought that they had a right to be admitted, and who grievouslyresented their exclusion. It cannot, therefore, be said that LadyMountjoy was popular; but she was large in figure, and painted well, andwore her diamonds with an air which her peculiar favorites declared tobe majestic. You could not see her going along the boulevards in hercarriage without being aware that a special personage was passing. Uponthe whole, it may be said that she performed well her special role inlife. Of Sir Magnus it was hinted that he was afraid of his wife; but intruth he desired it to be understood that all the disagreeable thingsdone at the Embassy were done by Lady Mountjoy, and not by him. He didnot refuse leave to the ladies to drop their cards at his hall-door. Hecould ask a few men to his table without referring the matter to hiswife; but every one would understand that the asking of ladies was basedon a different footing.He knew well that as a rule it was not fitting that he should ask amarried man without his wife; but there are occasions on which an excusecan be given, and upon the whole the men liked it. He was a stout, tall,portly old gentleman, sixty years of age, but looking somewhat older,whom it was a difficulty to place on horseback, but who, when there,looked remarkably well. He rarely rose to a trot during his two hours ofexercise, which to the two attache's who were told off for the duty ofaccompanying him was the hardest part of their allotted work. But othergentlemen would lay themselves out to meet Sir Magnus and to ride withhim, and in this way he achieved that character for popularity which hadbeen a better aid to him in life than all the diplomatic skill which hepossessed."What do you think?" said he, walking off with Mrs. Mountjoy's letterinto his wife's room."I don't think anything, my dear.""You never do." Lady Mountjoy, who had not yet undergone her painting,looked cross and ill-natured. "At any rate, Sarah and her daughter areproposing to come here.""Good gracious! At once?""Yes, at once. Of course, I've asked them over and over again, andsomething was said about this autumn, when we had come back fromPimperingen.""Why did you not tell me?""Bother! I did tell you. This kind of thing always turns up at last.She's a very good kind of a woman, and the daughter is all that sheought to be.""Of course she'll be flirting with Anderson." Anderson was one of thetwo mounted attaches."Anderson will know how to look after himself," said Sir Magnus. "At anyrate they must come. They have never troubled us before, and we ought toput up with them once.""But, my dear, what is all this about her brother?""She won't bring her brother with her.""How can you be sure of that?" said the anxious lady."He is dying, and can't be moved.""But that son of his--Mountjoy. It's altogether a most distressingstory. He turns out to be nobody after all, and now he has disappeared,and the papers for an entire month were full of him. What would you doif he were to turn up here? The girl was engaged to him, you know, andhas only thrown him off since his own father declared that he was notlegitimate. There never was such a mess about anything since Londonfirst began."Then Sir Magnus declared that, let Mountjoy Scarborough and his fatherhave misbehaved as they might, Mr. Scarborough's sister must be receivedat Brussels. There was a little family difficulty. Sir Magnus hadborrowed three thousand pounds from the general which had been settledon the general's widow, and the interest was not always paid withextreme punctuality. To give Mrs. Mountjoy her due, it must be said thatthis had not entered into her consideration when she had written to herbrother-in-law; but it was a burden to Sir Magnus, and had alwaystended to produce from him a reiteration of those invitations, whichMrs. Mountjoy had taken as an expression of brotherly love. Her ownincome was always sufficient for her wants, and the hundred and fiftypounds coming from Sir Magnus had not troubled her much. "Well, my dear,if it must be it must;--only what I'm to do with her I do not know.""Take her about in the carriage," said Sir Magnus, who was beginning tobe a little angry with this interference."And the daughter? Daughters are twice more troublesome than theirmothers.""Pass her over to Miss Abbott. And for goodness' sake don't make so muchtrouble about things which need not be troublesome." Then Sir Magnusleft his wife to ring for her chambermaid and go on with her painting,while he himself undertook the unwonted task of writing an affectionateletter to his sister-in-law. It should be here explained that Sir Magnushad no children of his own, and that Miss Abbott was the lady who wasbound to smile and say pretty things on all occasions to Lady Mountjoyfor the moderate remuneration of two hundred a year and her maintenance.The letter which Sir Magnus wrote was as follows:  MY DEAR SARAH,--Lady Mountjoy bids me say that we shall  be delighted to receive you and my niece at the British  Ministry on the 1st of October, and hope that you will  stay with us till the end of the month.--Believe me, most  affectionately yours,                    MAGNUS MOUNTJOY."I have a most kind letter from Sir Magnus," said Mrs. Mountjoy to herdaughter."What does he say?""That he will be delighted to receive us on the 1st of October. I didsay that we should be ready to start in about a week's time, because Iknow that he gets home from his autumn holiday by the middle ofSeptember. But I have no doubt he has his house full till the time hehas named.""Do you know her, mamma?" asked Florence."I did see her once; but I cannot say that I know her. She used to be avery handsome woman, and looks to be quite good-natured; but Sir Magnushas always lived abroad, and except when he came home about your poorfather's death I have seen very little of him.""I never saw him but that once," said Florence.And so it was settled that she and her mother were to spend a month atBrussels.CHAPTER XI.MONTE CARLO.Toward the end of September, while the weather was so hot as to keepaway from the south of France all but very determined travellers, anEnglish gentleman, not very beautiful in his outward appearance, wassauntering about the great hall of the gambling-house at Monte Carlo, inthe kingdom or principality of Monaco, the only gambling-house now leftin Europe in which idle men of a speculative nature may yet solace theirhours with some excitement. Nor is the amusement denied to idle ladies,as might be seen by two or three highly-dressed _habituees_ who at thismoment were depositing their shawls and parasols with the porters. Theclock was on the stroke of eleven, when the gambling-room would be open,and the amusement was too rich in its nature to allow of the loss ofeven a few minutes. But this gentleman was not an _habitue_, nor was heknown even by name to any of the small crowd that was then assembled.But it was known to many of them that he had had a great "turn of luck"on the preceding day, and had walked off from the "rouge-et-noir" tablewith four or five hundred pounds.The weather was still so hot that but few Englishmen were there, and theplay had not as yet begun to run high. There were only two or three,--menwho cannot keep their hands from ruin when ruin is open to them. To themheat and cold, the dog-star or twenty degrees below zero, make nodifference while the croupier is there, with his rouleaux before him,capable of turning up the card. They know that the chance is againstthem,--one in twenty, let us say,--and that in the long-run one in twentyis as good as two to one to effect their ruin. For a day they may standagainst one in twenty, as this man had done. For two or three days, fora week, they may possibly do so; but they know that the doom must comeat last,--as it does come invariably,--and they go on. But our friend, theEnglishman who had won the money, was not such a one as these, at anyrate in regard to Monaco. Yesterday had been his first appearance, andhe had broken ground there with great success. He was an ill-lookingperson, poorly clad,--what, in common parlance, we should call seedy. Hehad not a scrap of beard on his face, and though swarthy and dark as tohis countenance, was light as to his hair, which hung in quantities downhis back. He was dressed from head to foot in a suit of cross-barred,light-colored tweed, of which he wore the coat buttoned tight over hischest, as though to hide some deficiency of linen.The gentleman was altogether a disreputable-looking personage, and theywho had seen him win his money,--Frenchmen and Italians for the mostpart,--had declared among themselves that his luck had been mostmiraculous. It was observed that he had a companion with him, who stuckclose to his elbow, and it was asserted that this companion continuallyurged him to leave the room. But as long as the croupier remained at thetable he remained, and continued to play through the day with almostinvariable luck. It was surmised among the gamblers there that he hadnot entered the room with above twenty or thirty pieces in his pocket,and that he had taken away with him, when the place was closed, sixhundred napoleons. "Look there; he has come again to give it all back toMadame Blanc, with interest," said a Frenchman to an Italian."Yes; and he will end by blowing his brains out within a week. He isjust the man to do it.""These Englishmen always rush at their fate like mad bulls," said theFrenchman. "They get less distraction for their money than any one.""Che va piano va sano," said the Italian, jingling the four napoleons inhis pocket, which had been six on yesterday morning. Then they saunteredup to the Englishman, and both of them touched their hats to him. TheEnglishman just acknowledged the compliment, and walked off with hiscompanion, who was still whispering something into his ear."It is a gendarme who is with him, I think," said the Frenchman, "onlythe man does not walk erect."Who does not know the outside hall of the magnificent gambling-house atMonte Carlo, with all the golden splendor of its music-room within? Whodoes not know the lofty roof and lounging seats, with its luxuries ofliveried servants, its wealth of newspapers, and every appanage ofcostly comfort which can be added to it? And its music within,--who doesnot know that there are to be heard sounds in a greater perfection oforchestral melody than are to be procured by money and trouble combinedin the great capitals of Europe? Think of the trouble endured by thoseunhappy fathers of families who indulge their wives and daughters at thePhilharmonic and St. James's Hall! Think of the horrors of our theatres,with their hot gas, and narrow passages, and difficulties of entrance,and almost impossibility of escape! And for all this money has to bepaid,--high prices,--and the day has to be fixed long beforehand, so thatthe tickets may be secured, and the daily feast,--papa's too oftensolitary enjoyment,--has to be turned into a painful early fast. And whenat last the thing has been done, and the torment endured, the soundsheard have not always been good of their kind, for the money has notsufficed to purchase the aid of a crowd of the best musicians. But atMonte Carlo you walk in with your wife in her morning costume, andseating yourself luxuriously in one of those soft stalls which are thereprepared for you, you give yourself up with perfect ease to absoluteenjoyment. For two hours the concert lasts, and all around is perfectionand gilding. There is nothing to annoy the most fastidious taste. Youhave not heated yourself with fighting your way up crowded stairs; nobox-keeper has asked you for a shilling. No link-boy has dunned youbecause he stood useless for a moment at the door of your carriage. Nopanic has seized you, and still oppresses you, because of the narrowdimensions in which you have to seat yourself for the next three hours.There are no twenty minutes during which you are doomed to sit inmiserable expectation. Exactly at the hour named the music begins, andfor two hours it is your own fault if you be not happy. Arailway-carriage has brought you to steps leading up to the garden inwhich these princely halls are built, and when the music is over willagain take you home. Nothing can be more perfect than the concert-roomat Monte Carlo, and nothing more charming; and for all this there isnothing whatever to pay.But by whom;--out of whose pocket are all these good things provided?They tell you at Monte Carlo that from time to time are to be seen menwalking off in the dark of the night or the gloom of the evening, or,for the matter of that, in the broad light of day, if the sternnecessity of the hour require it, with a burden among them, to bedeposited where it may not be seen or heard of any more. They arecarrying away "all that mortal remains" of one of the gentlemen who havepaid for your musical entertainment. He has given his all for thepurpose, and has then--blown his brains out. It is one of thedisagreeable incidents to which the otherwise extremely pleasantmoney-making operations of the establishment are liable. Such accidentswill happen. A gambling-house, the keeper of which is able to maintainthe royal expense of the neighboring court out of his winnings and alsoto keep open for those who are not ashamed to accept it,--gratis, allfor love,--a concert-room brilliant with gold, filled with the bestperformers whom the world can furnish, and comfortable beyond allopera-houses known to men must be liable to a few such misfortunes. Whois not ashamed to accept, I have said, having lately been there andthoroughly enjoyed myself? But I did not put myself in the way of havingto cut my throat, on which account I felt, as I came out, that I hadbeen somewhat shabby. I was ashamed in that I had not put a fewnapoleons down on the table. Conscience had prevented me, and a wish tokeep my money. But should not conscience have kept me away from all thathappiness for which I had not paid? I had not thought of it before Iwent to Monte Carlo, but I am inclined now to advise others to stayaway, or else to put down half a napoleon, at any rate, as the price ofa ticket. The place is not overcrowded, because the conscience of manyis keener than was mine.We ought to be grateful to the august sovereign of Monaco in that heenabled an enterprising individual to keep open for us in so brilliant afashion the last public gambling-house in Europe. The principality isbut large enough to contain the court of the sovereign which is held inthe little town of Monaco, and the establishment of the last oflegitimate gamblers which is maintained at Monte Carlo. If the report ofthe world does not malign the prince, he lives, as does the gambler, outof the spoil taken from the gamblers. He is to be seen in his royalcarriage going forth with his royal consort,--and very royal he looks!His little teacup of a kingdom,--or rather a roll of French bread, for itis crusty and picturesque,--is now surrounded by France. There is Niceaway to the west, and Mentone to the east, and the whole kingdom lieswithin the compass of a walk. Mentone, in France, at any rate, is withinfive miles of the monarch's residence. How happy it is that there shouldbe so blessed a spot left in tranquillity on the earth's surface!But on the present occasion Monte Carlo was not in all its grandeur,because of the heat of the weather. Another month, and English lords,and English members of Parliament, and English barristers would bethere,--all men, for instance, who could afford to be indifferent as totheir character for a month,--and the place would be quite alive withmusic, cards, and dice. At present men of business only flocked to itshalls, eagerly intent on making money, though, alas! almost all doomedto lose it. But our one friend with the long light locks was impatientfor the fray. The gambling-room had now been opened, and the servantsof the table, less impatient than he, were slowly arranging their moneyand their cards. Our friend had taken his seat, and was alreadyresolving, with his eyes fixed on the table, where he would make hisfirst plunge. In his right hand was a bag of gold, and under his lefthand were hidden the twelve napoleons with which he intended tocommence. On yesterday he had gone through his day's work by twelve,though on one or two occasions he had plunged deeply. It had seemed tothis man as though a new heaven had been opened to him, as of late hehad seen little of luck in this world. The surmises made as to the lowstate of his funds when he entered the room had been partly true; buttime had been when he was able to gamble in a more costly fashion eventhan here, and to play among those who had taken his winnings andlosings simply as a matter of course.And now the game had begun, and the twelve napoleons were dulydeposited. Again he won his stake, an omen for the day, and wasexultant. A second twelve and a third were put down, and on eachoccasion he won. In the silly imagination of his heart he declared tohimself that the calculation of all chances was as nothing against hisrun of luck. Here was the spot on which it was destined that he shouldredeem all the injury which fortune had done him. And in truth this manhad been misused by fortune. His companion whispered in his ear, but heheard not a word of it. He increased the twelve to fifteen, and againwon. As he looked round there was a halo of triumph which seemed toilluminate his face. He had chained Chance to his chariot-wheel andwould persevere now that the good time had come. What did he care forthe creature at his elbow? He thought of all the good things which moneycould again purchase for him as he carefully fingered the gold for thenext stake. He had been rich, though he was now poor; though how could aman be accounted poor who had an endless sum of six hundred napoleons inhis pocket, a sum which was, in truth, endless, while it could be sorapidly recruited in this fashion? The next stake he also won, but as heraked all the pieces which the croupier pushed toward him his mind hadbecome intent on another sphere and on other persons. Let him win whathe might, his old haunts were now closed against him. What good wouldmoney do him, living such a life as he must now be compelled to pass? Ashe thought of this the five-and-twenty napoleons on the table were takenaway from him almost without consciousness on his part.At that moment there came a voice in his ear,--not the voice of hisattending friend, but one of which he accurately knew the lisping,fiendish sound: "Ah, Captain Scarborough, I thought it vas posshible youmight be here. Dis ish a very nice place." Our friend looked round andglared at the man, and felt that it was impossible that this occupationshould be continued under his eyes. "Yesh; it was likely. How do youlike Monte Carlo? You have plenty of money--plenty!" The man was small,and oily, and black-haired, and beaky-nosed, with a perpetual smile onhis face, unless when on special occasions he would be moved to theexpression of deep anger. Of the modern Hebrews a most complete Hebrew;but a man of purpose, who never did things by halves, who could countupon good courage within, and who never allowed himself to be foiled bymisadventure. He was one who, beginning with nothing, was determined todie a rich man, and was likely to achieve his purpose. Now there was nogleam of anger on his face, but a look of invincible good-humor, whichwas not, however, quite good-humor, when you came to examine it closely."Oh, that is you, is it, Mr. Hart?""Yesh; it is me. I have followed you. Oh, I have had quite a pleasanttour following you. But ven I got my noshe once on to the schent then Iwas sure it was Monte Carlo. And it ish Monte Carlo; eh, CaptainScarborough?""Yes; of course it is Monte Carlo. That is to say, Monte Carlo is theplace where we are now. I don't know what you mean by running on in thatway." Then he drew back from the table, Mr. Hart following close behindhim, and his attendant at a farther distance behind him. As he went heremembered that he had slightly increased the six hundred napoleons ofyesterday, and that the money was still in his own possession. Not allthe Jews in London could touch the money while he kept it in his pocket."Who ish dat man there?" asked Mr. Hart."What can that be to you?""He seems to follow you pretty close.""Not so close as you do, by George; and perhaps he has something to getby it, which you haven't.""Come, come, come! If he have more to get than I he mush be pretty deep.There is Mishter Tyrrwhit. No one have more to get than I, only MishterTyrrwhit. Vy, Captain Scarborough, the little game you wash playingthere, which wash a very pretty little game, is as nothing to my gamewish you. When you see the money down, on the table there, it seems tobe mush because the gold glitters, but it is as noting to my littlegame, where the gold does not glitter, because it is pen and ink. A penand ink soon writes ten thousand pounds. But you think mush of it whenyou win two hundred pounds at roulette.""I think nothing of it," said our friend Captain Scarborough."And it goes into your pocket to give champagne to the ladies, insteadof paying your debts to the poor fellows who have supplied you for solong with all de money."All this occurred in the gambling-house at a distance from the table,but within hearing of that attendant who still followed the player.These moments were moments of misery to the captain in spite of thebank-notes for six hundred napoleons which were still in his breastcoat-pocket. And they were not made lighter by the fact that all thewords spoken by the Jew were overheard by the man who was supposed to bethere in the capacity of his servant. But the man, as it seemed, had amission to fulfil, and was the captain's master as well as servant. "Mr.Hart," said Captain Scarborough, repressing the loudness of his words asfar as his rage would admit him, but still speaking so as to attract theattention of some of those round him, "I do not know what good youpropose to yourself by following me in this manner. You have my bonds,which are not even payable till my father's death.""Ah, there you are very much mistaken.""And are then only payable out of the property to which I believedmyself to be heir when the money was borrowed.""You are still de heir--de heir to Tretton. There is not a shadow of adoubt as to that.""I hope when the time comes," said the captain, "you'll be able to proveyour words.""Of course we shall prove dem. Why not? Your father and your brother arevery clever shentlemen, I think, but they will not be more clever thanMishter Samuel Hart. Mr. Tyrrwhit also is a clever man. Perhaps heunderstands your father's way of doing business. Perhaps it is all rightwith Mr. Tyrrwhit. It shall be all right with me too;--I swear it. Whenwill you come back to London, Captain Scarborough?"Then there came an angry dispute in the gambling-room, during which Mr.Hart by no means strove to repress his voice. Captain Scarboroughasserted his rights as a free agent, declaring himself capable, as faras the law was concerned, of going wherever he pleased without referenceto Mr. Hart; and told that gentleman that any interference on his partwould be regarded as an impertinence. "But my money--my money, which youmust pay this minute, if I please to demand it.""You did not lend me five-and-twenty thousand pounds without security.""It is forty-five--now, at this moment.""Take it, get it; go and put it in your pocket. You have a lot ofwritings; turn then into cash at once. Take them to any other Jew inLondon and sell them. See if you can get your five-and-twenty thousandpounds for them,--or twenty-five thousand shillings. You certainlycannot get five-and-twenty pence for them here, though you had all thepolice of this royal kingdom to support you. My father says that thebonds I gave you are not worth the paper on which they were written. Ifyou are cheated, so have I been. If he has robbed you, so has he me. ButI have not robbed you, and you can do nothing to me.""I vill stick to you like beesvax," said Mr. Hart, while the look ofgood-humor left his countenance for a moment. "Like beesvax! You shallnot escape me again.""You will have to follow me to Constantinople, then.""I vill follow you to the devil.""You are likely to go before me there. But for the present I am off toConstantinople, from whence I intend to make an extended tour to MountCaucasus, and then into Thibet. I shall be very glad of your company,but cannot offer to pay the bill. When you and your companions havesettled yourselves comfortably at Tretton, I shall be happy to come andsee you there. You will have to settle the matter first with my youngerbrother, if I may make bold to call that well-born gentleman my brotherat all. I wish you a good-morning, Mr. Hart." Upon that he walked outinto the hall, and thence down the steps into the garden in front of theestablishment, his own attendant following him.Mr. Hart also followed him, but did not immediately seek to renew theconversation. If he meant to show any sign of keeping his threat and ofsticking to the captain like beeswax, he must show his purpose at once.The captain for a time walked round the little enclosure in earnestconversation with the attendant, and Mr. Hart stood on the stepswatching them. Play was over, at any rate for that day, as far as thecaptain was concerned."Now, Captain Scarborough, don't you think you've been very rash?" saidthe attendant."I think I've got six hundred and fifty napoleons in my pocket, insteadof waiting to get them in driblets from my brother.""But if he knew that you had come here he would withdraw themaltogether. Of course, he will know now. That man will be sure to tellhim. He will let all London know. Of course, it would be so when youcame to a place of such common resort as Monte Carlo.""Common resort! Do you believe he came here as to a place of commonresort? Do you think that he had not tracked me out, and would not havedone so, whether I had gone to Melbourne, or New York, or St.Petersburg? But the wonder is that he should spend his money in such avain pursuit.""Ah, captain, you do not know what is vain and what is not. It is yourbrother's pleasure that you should be kept in the dark for a time.""Hang my brother's pleasure! Why am I to follow my brother's pleasure?""Because he will allow you an income. He will keep a coat on your backand a hat on your head, and supply meat and wine for your needs." HereCaptain Scarborough jingled the loose napoleons in his trousers pocket."Oh, yes, that is all very well but it will not last forever. Indeed, itwill not last for a week unless you leave Monte Carlo.""I shall leave it this afternoon by the train for Genoa.""And where shall you go then?""You heard me suggest to Mr. Hart to the devil,--or else Constantinople,and after that to Thibet. I suppose I shall still enjoy the pleasure ofyour company?""Mr. Augustus wishes that I should remain with you, and, as you yourselfsay, perhaps it will be best."CHAPTER XII.HARRY ANNESLEY'S SUCCESS.Harry Annesley, a day or two after he had left Tretton, went down toCheltenham; for he had received an invitation to a dance there, and withthe invitation an intimation that Florence Mountjoy was to be at thedance. If I were to declare that the dance had been given and Florenceasked to it merely as an act of friendship to Harry, it would perhaps bethought that modern friendship is seldom carried to so great a length.But it was undoubtedly the fact that Mrs. Armitage, who gave the dance,was a great friend and admirer of Harry's, and that Mr. Armitage was anespecial chum. Let not, however, any reader suppose that Florence was inthe secret. Mrs. Armitage had thought it best to keep her in the dark asto the person asked to meet her. "As to my going to Montpelier Place,"Harry had once said to Mrs. Armitage, "I might as well knock at aprison-door." Mrs. Mountjoy lived in Montpelier Place."I think we could perhaps manage that for you," Mrs. Armitage hadreplied, and she had managed it."Is she coming?" Harry said to Mrs. Armitage, in an anxious whisper, ashe entered the room."She has been here this half-hour,--if you had taken the trouble to leaveyour cigars and come and meet her.""She has not gone?" said Harry, almost awe-struck at the idea."No; she is sitting like Patience on a monument, smiling at grief, inthe room inside. She has got horrible news to tell you.""Oh, heavens! What news?""I suppose she will tell you, though she has not been communicative tome in regard to your royal highness. The news is simply that her motheris going to take her to Brussels, and that she is to live for a whileamid the ambassadorial splendors with Sir Magnus and his wife."By retiring from the world Mrs. Mountjoy had not intended to includesuch slight social relaxations as Mrs. Armitage's party, for Harry onturning round encountered her talking to another Cheltenham lady. Hegreeted her with his pleasantest smile, to which Mrs. Mountjoy did notrespond quite so sweetly. She had ever greatly feared Harry Annesley,and had to-day heard a story very much, as she thought, to hisdiscredit. "Is your daughter here?" asked Harry, with well-trainedhypocrisy. Mrs. Mountjoy could not but acknowledge that Florence was inthe room, and then Harry passed on in pursuit of his quarry."Oh, Mr. Annesley, when did you come to Cheltenham?""As soon as I heard that Mrs. Armitage was going to have a party I beganto think of coming immediately." Then an idea for the first time shotthrough Florence's mind--that her friend Mrs. Armitage was a womandevoted to intrigue. "What dance have you disengaged? I have somethingthat I must tell you to-night. You don't mean to say that you will notgive me one dance?" This was merely a lover's anxious doubt on hispart, because Florence had not at once replied to him. "I am told thatyou are going away to Brussels.""Mamma is going on a visit to her brother-in-law.""And you with her?""Of course I shall go with mamma." All this had been said apart, while afair-haired, lackadaisical young gentleman was standing twiddling histhumbs waiting to dance with Florence. At last the little book from herwaist was brought forth, and Harry's name was duly inscribed. The nextdance was a quadrille, and he saw that the space after that was alsovacant; so he boldly wrote down his name for both. I almost think thatFlorence must have suspected that Harry Annesley was to be there thatnight, or why should the two places have been kept vacant? "And now whatis this," he began, "about your going to Brussels?""Mamma's brother is minister there, and we are just going on a visit.""But why now? I am sure there is some especial cause." Florence wouldnot say that there was no especial cause, so she could only repeat herassertion that they certainly were going to Brussels. She herself waswell aware that she was to be taken out of Harry's way, and thatsomething was expected to occur during this short month of her absencewhich might be detrimental to him,--and to her also. But this she couldnot tell, nor did she like to say that the plea given by her mother wasthe general state of the Scarborough affairs. She did not wish todeclare to this lover that that other lover was as nothing to her. "Andhow long are you to be away?" asked Harry."We shall be a month with Sir Magnus; but mamma is talking of going onafterward to the Italian lakes.""Good heavens! you will not be back, I suppose, till ever so much afterChristmas?""I cannot tell. Nothing as yet has been settled. I do not know that Iought to tell you anything about it." Harry at this moment looked up,and caught the eye of Mrs. Mountjoy, as she was standing in the door-wayopposite. Mrs. Mountjoy certainly looked as though no specialcommunication as to Florence's future movements ought to be made toHarry Annesley.Then, however, it came to his turn to dance, and he had a moment allowedto him to collect his thoughts. By nothing that he could do or say couldhe prevent her going, and he could only use the present moment to thebest purpose in his power. He bethought himself then that he had neverreceived from her a word of encouragement, and that such word, if everto be spoken, should be forthcoming that night. What might not happen toa girl who was passing the balmy Christmas months amid the sweet shadowsof an Italian lake? Harry's ideas of an Italian lake were, in truth, atpresent somewhat vague. But future months were, to his thinking,interminable; the present moment only was his own. The dance was nowfinished. "Come and take a walk," said Harry."I think I will go to mamma." Florence had seen her mother's eye fixedupon her."Oh, come, that won't do at all," said Harry, who had already got herhand within his arm. "A fellow is always entitled to five minutes, andthen I am down for the next waltz.""Oh no!""But I am, and you can't get out of it now. Oh, Florence, will youanswer me a question,--one question? I asked it you before, and you didnot vouchsafe me any answer.""You asked me no question," said Florence, who remembered to the lastsyllable every word that had been said to her on that occasion."Did I not? I am sure you knew what it was that I intended to ask."Florence could not but think that this was quite another thing. "Oh,Florence, can you love me?" Had she given her ears for it she could nothave told him the truth then, on the spur of the moment. Her mother'seye was, she knew, watching her through the door-way all the way acrossfrom the other room. And yet, had her mother asked her, she would haveanswered boldly that she did love Harry Annesley, and intended to lovehim for ever and ever with all her heart. And she would have gonefarther if cross-questioned, and have declared that she regarded himalready as her lord and master. But now she had not a word to say tohim. All she knew was that he had now pledged himself to her, and thatshe intended to keep him to his pledge. "May I not have one word," hesaid,--"one word?"What could he want with a word more? thought Florence. Her silence nowwas as good as any speech. But as he did want more she would, after herown way, reply to him. So there came upon his arm the slightest possiblesense of pressure from those sweet fingers, and Harry Annesley was on asudden carried up among azure-tinted clouds into the farthest heaven ofhappiness. After a moment he stood still, and passed his fingers throughhis hair and waved his head as a god might do it. She had now made tohim a solemn promise than which no words could be more binding. "Oh,Florence," he exclaimed, "I must have you alone with me for one moment."For what could he want her alone for any moment? thought Florence. Therewas her mother still looking at them; but for her Harry did not now careone straw. Nor did he hate those bright Italian lakes with nearly sostrong a feeling of abhorrence. "Florence, you are now all my own."There came another slightest pressure, slight, but so eloquent fromthose fingers."I hate dancing. How is a fellow to dance now? I shall run againsteverybody. I can see no one. I should be sure to make a fool of myself.No, I don't want to dance even with you. No, certainly not!--let youdance with somebody else, and you engaged to me! Well, if I must, ofcourse I must. I declare, Florence, you have not spoken a single word tome, though there is so much that you must have to say. What have you gotto say? What a question to ask! You must tell me. Oh, you know what youhave got to tell me! The sound of it will be the sweetest music that aman can possibly hear.""You knew it all, Harry," she whispered."But I want to hear it. Oh, Florence, Florence, I do not think you canunderstand how completely I am beyond myself with joy. I cannot danceagain, and will not. Oh, my wife, my wife!""Hush!" said Florence, afraid that the very walls might hear the soundof Harry's words."What does it signify though all the world knew it?""Oh yes.""That I should have been so fortunate! That is what I cannot understand.Poor Mountjoy! I do feel for him. That he should have had the start ofme so long, and have done nothing!""Nothing," whispered Florence."And I have done everything. I am so proud of myself that I think I mustlook almost like a hero."They had now got to the extremity of the room near an open window, andFlorence found that she was able to say one word. "You are my hero." Thesound of this nearly drove him mad with joy. He forgot all his troubles.Prodgers, the policeman, Augustus Scarborough, and that fellow whom hehated so much, Septimus Jones;--what were they all to him now? He had sethis mind upon one thing of value, and he had got it. Florence hadpromised to be his, and he was sure that she would never break her wordto him. But he felt that for the full enjoyment of his triumph he mustbe alone somewhere with Florence for five minutes. He had not actuallyexplained to himself why, but he knew that he wished to be alone withher. At present there was no prospect of any such five minutes, but hemust say something in preparation for some future five minutes at a timeto come. Perhaps it might be to-morrow, though he did not at present seehow that might be possible, for Mrs. Mountjoy, he knew, would shut herdoor against him. And Mrs. Mountjoy was already prowling round the roomafter her daughter. Harry saw her as he got Florence to an oppositedoor, and there for the moment escaped with her. "And now," he said,"how am I to manage to see you before you go to Brussels?""I do not know that you can see me.""Do you mean that you are to be shut up, and that I am not to be allowedto approach you?""I do mean it. Mamma is, of course, attached to her nephew.""What, after all that has passed?""Why not? Is he to blame for what his father has done?" Harry felt thathe could not press the case against Captain Scarborough without somewant of generosity. And though he had told Florence once about thatdreadful midnight meeting, he could say nothing farther on that subject."Of course mamma thinks that I am foolish.""But why?" he asked."Because she doesn't see with my eyes, Harry. We need not say anythingmore about it at present. It is so; and therefore I am to go toBrussels. You have made this opportunity for yourself before I start.Perhaps I have been foolish to be taken off my guard.""Don't say that, Florence.""I shall think so, unless you can be discreet. Harry, you will have towait. You will remember that we must wait; but I shall not change.""Nor I,--nor I.""I think not, because I trust you. Here is mamma, and now I must leaveyou. But I shall tell mamma everything before I go to bed." Then Mrs.Mountjoy came up and took Florence away, with a few words of mostdisdainful greeting to Harry Annesley.When Florence was gone Harry felt that as the sun and the moon and thestars had all set, and as absolute darkness reigned through the rooms,he might as well escape into the street, where there was no one but thepolice to watch him, as he threw his hat up into the air in hisexultation. But before he did so he had to pass by Mrs. Armitage andthank her for all her kindness; for he was aware how much she had donefor him in his present circumstances. "Oh, Mrs. Armitage, I am soobliged to you! no fellow was ever so obliged to a friend before.""How has it gone off? For Mrs. Mountjoy has taken Florence home.""Oh yes, she has taken her away. But she hasn't shut the stable-doortill the steed has been stolen.""Oh, the steed has been stolen?""Yes, I think so; I do think so.""And that poor man who has disappeared is nowhere.""Men who disappear never are anywhere. But I do flatter myself that ifhe had held his ground and kept his property the result would have beenthe same.""I dare say.""Don't suppose, Mrs. Armitage, that I am taking any pride to myself. Whyon earth Florence should have taken a fancy to such a fellow as I am Icannot imagine.""Oh no; not in the least.""It's all very well for you to laugh, Mrs. Armitage, but as I havethought of it all I have sometimes been in despair.""But now you are not in despair.""No, indeed; just now I am triumphant. I have thought so often that Iwas a fool to love her, because everything was so much against me.""I have wondered that you continued. It always seemed to me that therewasn't a ghost of a chance for you. Mr. Armitage bade me give it all up,because he was sure you would never do any good.""I don't care how much you laugh at me, Mrs. Armitage.""Let those laugh who win." Then he rushed out into the Paragon, andabsolutely did throw his hat up in the air in his triumph.CHAPTER XIII.MRS. MOUNTJOY'S ANGER.Florence, as she went home in the fly with her mother after the party atwhich Harry had spoken to her so openly, did not find the little journeyvery happy. Mrs. Mountjoy was a woman endowed with a strong power ofwishing rather than of willing, of desiring rather than of contriving;but she was one who could make herself very unpleasant when she wasthwarted. Her daughter was now at last fully determined that if she evermarried anybody, that person should be Harry Annesley. Having oncepressed his arm in token of assent, she had as it were given herselfaway to him, so that no reasoning, no expostulations could, she thought,change her purpose; and she had much more power of bringing about herpurposed design than had her mother. But her mother could be obstinateand self-willed, and would for the time make herself disagreeable.Florence had assured her lover that everything should be told her motherthat night before she went to bed. But Mrs. Mountjoy did not wait to besimply told. No sooner were they seated in the fly together than shebegan to make her inquiries. "What has that man been saying to you?" shedemanded.Florence was at once offended by hearing her lover so spoken of, andcould not simply tell the story of Harry's successful courtship, as shehad intended. "Mamma," she said "why do you speak of him like that?""Because he is a scamp.""No, he is no scamp. It is very unkind of you to speak in such terms ofone whom you know is very dear to me.""I do not know it. He ought not to be dear to you at all. You have beenfor years intended for another purpose." This was intolerable toFlorence,--this idea that she should have been considered as capable ofbeing intended for the purposes of other people! And a resolution atonce was formed in her mind that she would let her mother know that suchintentions were futile. But for the moment she sat silent. A journeyhome at twelve o'clock at night in a fly was not the time for theexpression of her resolution. "I say he is a scamp," said Mrs. Mountjoy."During all these inquiries that have been made after your cousin he hasknown all about it.""He has not known all about it," said Florence."You contradict me in a very impertinent manner, and cannot beacquainted with the circumstances. The last person who saw your cousinin London was Mr. Henry Annesley, and yet he has not said a word aboutit, while search was being made on all sides. And he saw him undercircumstances most suspicious in their nature; so suspicious as to havemade the police arrest him if they were aware of them. He had at thatmoment grossly insulted Captain Scarborough.""No, mamma; no, it was not so.""How do you know? how can you tell?""I do know; and I can tell. The ill-usage had come from the other side.""Then you, too, have known the secret, and have said nothing about it?You, too, have been aware of the violence which took place at thatmidnight meeting? You have been aware of what befell your cousin, theman to whom you were all but engaged. And you have held your tongue atthe instigation, no doubt, of Mr. Henry Annesley. Oh, Florence, you alsowill find yourself in the hands of the policeman!" At this moment thefly drew up at the door of the house in Montpelier Place, and the twoladies had to get out and walk up the steps into the hall, where theywere congratulated on their early return from the party by thelady's-maid."Mamma, I will go to bed," said Florence, as soon as she reached hermother's room."I think you had better, my dear, though Heaven knows what disturbancesthere may be during the night." By this Mrs. Mountjoy had intended toimply that Prodgers, the policeman, might probably lose not a momentmore before he would at once proceed to arrest Miss Mountjoy for thesteps she had taken in regard to the disappearance of CaptainScarborough.She had heard from Harry Annesley the fact that he had been brutallyattacked by the captain in the middle of the night in the streets ofLondon; and for this, in accordance with her mother's theory, she was tobe dragged out of bed by a constable, and that, probably, before thenext morning should have come. There was something in this so ludicrousas regarded the truth of the story, and yet so cruel as coming from hermother, that Florence hardly knew whether to cry or laugh as she laidher head upon the pillow.But in the morning, as she was thinking that the facts of her ownposition had still to be explained to her mother,--that it would benecessary that she should declare her purpose and the impossibility ofchange, now that she had once pledged herself to her lover,--Mrs.Mountjoy came into the room, and stood at her bedside, with thatappearance of ghostly displeasure which always belongs to an angry oldlady in a night-cap."Well, mamma?""Florence, there must be an understanding between us.""I hope so. I thought there always had been. I am sure, mamma, you haveknown that I have never liked Captain Scarborough so as to become hiswife, and I think you have known that I have liked Harry Annesley.""Likings are all fiddlesticks!""No, mamma; or, if you object to the word, I will say love. You haveknown that I have not loved my cousin, and that I have loved this otherman. That is not nonsense; that at any rate is a stern reality, if therebe anything real in the world.""Stern! you may well call it stern.""I mean unbending, strong, not to be overcome by outside circumstances.If Mr. Annesley had not spoken to me as he did last night,--could neverhave so spoken to me,--I should have been a miserable girl, but my lovefor him would have been just as stern. I should have remained andthought of it, and have been unhappy through my whole life. But he hasspoken, and I am exultant. That is what I mean by stern. All that ismost important, at any rate to me.""I am here now to tell you that it is impossible.""Very well, mamma. Then things must go on, and we must bide our time.""It is proper that I should tell you that he has disgraced himself.""Never! I will not admit it. You do not know the circumstances,"exclaimed Florence."It is most impertinent in you to pretend that you know them better thanI do," said her mother, indignantly."The story was told to me by himself.""Yes; and therefore told untruly.""I grieve that you should think so of him, mamma; but I cannot help it.Where you have got your information I cannot tell. But that mine hasbeen accurately told to me I feel certain.""At any rate, my duty is to look after you and to keep you from harm. Ican only do my duty to the best of my ability. Mr. Annesley is, to mythinking, a most objectionable young man, and he will, I believe, be inthe hands of the police before long. Evidence will have to be given, inwhich your name will, unfortunately, be mentioned.""Why my name?""It is not probable that he will keep it a secret, whencross-questioned, as to his having divulged the story to some one. Hewill declare that he has told it to you. When that time shall come itwill be well that we should be out of the country. I propose to startfrom here on this day week.""Uncle Magnus will not be able to have us then.""We must loiter away our time on the road. I look upon it as quiteimperative that we shall both be out of England within eight days' timeof this.""But where will you go?""Never mind. I do not know that I have as yet quite made up my mind. Butyou may understand that we shall start from Cheltenham this day week.Baker will go with us, and I shall leave the other two servants incharge of the house. I cannot tell you anything farther as yet,--exceptthat I will never consent to your marriage with Mr. Henry Annesley. Youhad better know that for certain, and then there will be less cause forunhappiness between us." So saying, the angry ghost with the night-capon stalked out of the room.It need hardly be explained that Mrs. Mountjoy's information respectingthe scene in London had come to her from Augustus Scarborough. When hetold her that Annesley had been the last in London to see his brotherMountjoy, and had described the nature of the scene that had occurredbetween them, he had no doubt forgotten that he himself had subsequentlyseen his brother. In the story, as he had told it, there was no need tomention himself,--no necessity for such a character in making up thetragedy of that night. No doubt, according to his idea, the two had beenalone together. Harry had struck the blow by which his brother had beeninjured, and had then left him in the street. Mountjoy had subsequentlydisappeared, and Harry had told to no one that such an encounter hadtaken place. This had been the meaning of Augustus Scarborough when heinformed his aunt that Harry had been the last who had seen Mountjoybefore his disappearance. To Mrs. Mountjoy the fact had been mostinjurious to Harry's character. Harry had wilfully kept the secret whileall the world was at work looking for Mountjoy Scarborough; and, as faras Mrs. Mountjoy could understand, it might well be that Harry hadstruck the fatal blow that had sent her nephew to his long account. Allthe impossibilities in the case had not dawned upon her. It had notoccurred to her that Mountjoy could not have been killed and his bodymade away with without some great effort, in the performance of whichthe "scamp" would hardly have risked his life or his character. But thescamp was certainly a scamp, even though he might not be a murderer, orhe would have revealed the secret. In fact, Mrs. Mountjoy believed inthe matter exactly what Augustus had intended, and, so believing, hadresolved that her daughter should suffer any purgatory rather thanbecome Harry's wife.But her daughter made her resolutions exactly in the contrary direction.She in truth did know what had been done on that night, while her motherwas in ignorance. The extent of her mother's ignorance she understood,but she did not at all know where her mother had got her information.She felt that Harry's secret was in hands other than he had intended,and that some one must have spoken of the scene. It occurred to Florenceat the moment that this must have come from Mountjoy himself, whom shebelieved,--and rightly believed,--to have been the only second personpresent on the occasion. And if he had told it to any one, then mustthat "any one" know where and how he had disappeared. And theinformation must have been given to her mother solely with the view ofdamaging Harry's character, and of preventing Harry's marriage.Thinking of all this, Florence felt that a premeditated and foulattempt,--for, as she turned it in her mind, the attempt seemed to bevery foul,--was being made to injure Harry. A false accusation wasbrought against him, and was grounded on a misrepresentation of thetruth in such a manner as to subvert it altogether to Harry's injury. Itshould have no effect upon her. To this determination she came at once,and declared to herself solemnly that she would be true to it. Anattempt was made to undermine him in her estimation; but they who madeit had not known her character. She was sure of herself now, within herown bosom, that she was bound in a peculiar way to be more thanordinarily true to Harry Annesley. In such an emergency she ought to dofor Harry Annesley more than a girl in common circumstances would bejustified in doing for her lover. Harry was maligned, ill-used, andslandered. Her mother had been induced to call him a scamp, and to giveas her reason for doing so an account of a transaction which wasaltogether false, though she no doubt had believed it to be true.As she thought of all this she resolved that it was her duty to write toher lover, and tell him the story as she had heard it. It might be mostnecessary that he should know the truth. She would write her letter andpost it,--so that it should be altogether beyond her mother'scontrol,--and then would tell her mother that she had written it. She atfirst thought that she would keep a copy of the letter and show it toher mother. But when it was written,--those first words intended for alover's eyes which had ever been produced by her pen,--she found that shecould not subject those very words to her mother's hard judgment.Her letter was as follows:"DEAR HARRY,--You will be much surprised at receiving a letter from meso soon after our meeting last night. But I warn you that you must nottake it amiss. I should not write now were it not that I think it may befor your interest that I should do so. I do not write to say a wordabout my love, of which I think you may be assured without any letter. Itold mamma last night what had occurred between us, and she of coursewas very angry. You will understand that, knowing how anxious she hasbeen on behalf of my cousin Mountjoy. She has always taken his part, andI think it does mamma great honor not to throw him over now that he isin trouble. I should never have thrown him over in his trouble, had Iever cared for him in that way. I tell you that fairly, Master Harry."But mamma, in speaking against you, which she was bound to do insupporting poor Mountjoy, declared that you were the last person who hadseen my cousin before his disappearance, and she knew that there hadbeen some violent struggle between you. Indeed, she knew all the truthas to that night, except that the attack had been made by Mountjoy onyou. She turned the story all round, declaring that you had attackedhim,--which, as you perceive, gives a totally different appearance to thewhole matter. Somebody has told her,--though who it may have been Icannot guess,--but somebody has been endeavoring to do you all themischief he can in the matter, and has made mamma think evil of you. Shesays that after attacking him, and brutally ill-using him, you had lefthim in the street, and had subsequently denied all knowledge of havingseen him. You will perceive that somebody has been at work inventing astory to do you a mischief, and I think it right that I should tell you."But you must never believe that I shall believe anything to yourdiscredit. It would be to my discredit now. I know that you are good,and true, and noble, and that you would not do anything so foul as this.It is because I know this that I have loved you, and shall always loveyou. Let mamma and others say what they will, you are now to me all theworld. Oh, Harry, Harry, when I think of it, how serious it seems to me,and yet how joyful! I exult in you, and will do so, let them say whatthey may against you. You will be sure of that always. Will you not besure of it?"But you must not write a line in answer, not even to give me yourassurance. That must come when we shall meet at length,--say after adozen years or so. I shall tell mamma of this letter, whichcircumstances seem to demand, and shall assure her that you will writeno answer to it."Oh, Harry, you will understand all that I might say of my feelings inregard to you."Your own, FLORENCE."This letter, when she had written it and copied it fair and posted thecopy in the pillar-box close by, she found that she could not in any wayshow absolutely to her mother. In spite of all her efforts it had becomea love-letter. And what genuine love-letter can a girl show even to hermother? But she at once told her of what she had done. "Mamma, I havewritten a letter to Harry Annesley.""You have?""Yes, mamma; I have thought it right to tell him what you had heardabout that night.""And you have done this without my permission,--without even telling mewhat you were going to do?""If I had asked you, you would have told me not.""Of course I should have told you not. Good gracious! has it come tothis, that you correspond with a young gentleman without my leave, andwhen you know that I would not have given it?""Mamma, in this instance it was necessary.""Who was to judge of that?""If he is to be my husband--""But he is not to be your husband. You are never to speak to him again.You shall never be allowed to meet him; you shall be taken abroad, andthere you shall remain, and he shall hear nothing about you. If heattempts to correspond with you--""He will not.""How do you know?""I have told him not to write.""Told him, indeed! Much he will mind such telling! I shall give yourUncle Magnus a full account of it all and ask for his advice. He is aman in a high position, and perhaps you may think fit to obey him,although you utterly refuse to be guided in any way by your mother."Then the conversation for the moment came to an end. But Florence, asshe left her mother, assured herself that she could not promise anyclose obedience in any such matters to Sir Magnus.CHAPTER XIV.THEY ARRIVE IN BRUSSELS.For some weeks after the party at Mrs. Armitage's house, and thesubsequent explanations with her mother, Florence was made to suffermany things. First came the one week before they started, which wasperhaps the worst of all. This was specially embittered by the fact thatMrs. Mountjoy absolutely refused to divulge her plans as they were made.There was still a fortnight before she could be received at Brussels,and as to that fortnight she would tell nothing.Her knowledge of human nature probably went so far as to teach her thatshe could thus most torment her daughter. It was not that she wished totorment her in a revengeful spirit. She was quite sure within her ownbosom that she did all in love. She was devoted to her daughter. But shewas thwarted; and therefore told herself that she could best farther thegirl's interests by tormenting her. It was not meditated revenge, butthat revenge which springs up without any meditation, and is oftentherefore the most bitter. "I must bring her nose to the grindstone,"was the manner in which she would have probably expressed her thoughtsto herself. Consequently Florence's nose was brought to the grindstone,and the operation made her miserable. She would not, however, complainwhen she had discovered what her mother was doing. She asked suchquestions as appeared to be natural, and put up with replies whichpurposely withheld all information. "Mamma, have you not settled on whatday we shall start?" "No, my dear." "Mamma, where are we going?" "Icannot tell you as yet; I am by no means sure myself." "I shall be gladto know, mamma, what I am to pack up for use on the journey." "Just thesame as you would do on any journey." Then Florence held her tongue, andconsoled herself with thinking of Harry Annesley.At last the day came, and she knew that she was to be taken to Boulogne.Before this time she had received one letter from Harry, full of love,full of thanks,--just what a lover's letter ought to have been;--but yetshe was disturbed by it. It had been delivered to herself in the usualway, and she might have concealed the receipt of it from her mother,because the servants in the house were all on her side. But this wouldnot be in accordance with the conduct which she had arranged forherself, and she told her mother. "It is just an acknowledgment of mineto him. It was to have been expected, but I regret it.""I do not ask to see it," said Mrs. Mountjoy, angrily."I could not show it you, mamma, though I think it right to tell you ofit.""I do not ask to see it, I tell you. I never wish to hear his name againfrom your tongue. But I knew how it would be;--of course. I cannot allowthis kind of thing to go on. It must be prevented.""It will not go on, mamma.""But it has gone on. You tell me that he has already written. Do youthink it proper that you should correspond with a young man of whom I donot approve?" Florence endeavored to reflect whether she did think itproper or not. She thought it quite proper that she should love HarryAnnesley with all her heart, but was not quite sure as to thecorrespondence. "At any rate, you must understand," continued Mrs.Mountjoy, "that I will not permit it. All letters, while we are abroad,must be brought to me; and if any come from him they shall be sent backto him. I do not wish to open his letters, but you cannot be allowed toreceive them. When we are at Brussels I shall consult your uncle uponthe subject. I am very sorry, Florence, that there should be this causeof quarrel between us; but it is your doing.""Oh, mamma, why should you be so hard?""I am hard, because I will not allow you to accept a young man who has,I believe, behaved very badly, and who has got nothing of his own.""He is his uncle's heir.""We know what that may come to. Mountjoy was his father's heir; andnothing could be entailed more strictly than Tretton. We know whatentails have come to there. Mr. Prosper will find some way of escapingfrom it. Entails go for nothing now; and I hear that he thinks so badlyof his nephew that he has already quarrelled with him. And he is quite ayoung man himself. I cannot think how you can be so foolish,--you, whodeclared that you are throwing your cousin over because he is no longerto have all his father's property.""Oh, mamma, that is not true.""Very well, my dear.""I never allowed it to be said in my name that I was engaged to mycousin Mountjoy.""Very well, I will never allow it to be said in my name that with myconsent you are engaged to Mr. Henry Annesley."Six or seven days after this they were settled together mostuncomfortably in a hotel at Boulogne. Mrs. Mountjoy had gone therebecause there was no other retreat to which she could take her daughter,and because she had resolved to remove her from beyond the sphere ofHarry Annesley's presence. She had at first thought of Ostend; but ithad seemed to her that Ostend was within the kingdom reigned over by SirMagnus and that there would be some impropriety in removing from thenceto the capital in which Sir Magnus was reigning. It was as though youwere to sojourn for three days at the park-gates before you wereentertained at the mansion. Therefore they stayed at Boulogne, and Mrs.Mountjoy tried the bathing, cold as the water was with equinoctialgales, in order that there might be the appearance of a reason for herbeing at Boulogne. And for company's sake, in the hope of maintainingsome fellowship with her mother, Florence bathed also. "Mamma, he hasnot written again," said Florence, coming up one day from the stand."I suppose that you are impatient.""Why should there be a quarrel between us? I am not impatient. If youwould only believe me, it would be so much more happy for both of us.You always used to believe me.""That was before you knew Mr. Harry Annesley."There was something in this very aggravating,--something speciallyintended to excite angry feelings. But Florence determined to forbear."I think you may believe me, mamma. I am your own daughter, and I shallnot deceive you. I do consider myself engaged to Mr. Annesley.""You need not tell me that.""But while I am living with you I will promise not to receive lettersfrom him without your leave. If one should come I will bring it to you,unopened, so that you may deal with it as though it had been deliveredto yourself. I care nothing about my uncle as to this affair. What hemay say cannot affect me, but what you say does affect me very much. Iwill promise neither to write nor to hear from Mr. Annesley for threemonths. Will not that satisfy you?" Mrs. Mountjoy would not say that itdid satisfy her; but she somewhat mitigated her treatment of herdaughter till they arrived together at Sir Magnus's mansion.They were shown through the great hall by three lackeys into an innervestibule, where they encountered the great man himself. He was justthen preparing to be put on to his horse, and Lady Mountjoy had alreadygone forth in her carriage for her daily airing, with the object, intruth, of avoiding the new-comers. "My dear Sarah," said Sir Magnus, "Ihope I have the pleasure of seeing you and my niece very well. Let mesee, your name is--""My name is Florence," said the young lady so interrogated."Ah yes; to be sure. I shall forget my own name soon. If any one was tocall me Magnus without the 'Sir,' I shouldn't know whom they meant."Then he looked his niece in the face, and it occurred to him thatAnderson might not improbably desire to flirt with her. Anderson was theriding attache, who always accompanied him on horseback, and of whomLady Mountjoy had predicted that he would be sure to flirt with theminister's niece. At that moment Anderson himself came in, and someceremony of introduction took place. Anderson was a fair-haired,good-looking young man, with that thorough look of self-satisfaction andconceit which attaches are much more wont to exhibit than to deserve.For the work of an attache at Brussels is not of a nature to bring forththe highest order of intellect; but the occupations are of a nature tomake a young man feel that he is not like other young men."I am so sorry that Lady Mountjoy has just gone out. She did not expectyou till the later train. You have been staying at Boulogne. What onearth made you stay at Boulogne?""Bathing," said Mrs. Mountjoy, in a low voice."Ah, yes; I suppose so. Why did you not come to Ostend? There is betterbathing there, and I could have done something for you. What! The horsesready, are they? I must go out and show myself, or otherwise they'll allthink that I am dead. If I were absent from the boulevard at this timeof day I should be put into the newspapers. Where is Mrs. Richards?"Then the two guests, with their own special Baker, were made over to theministerial house-keeper, and Sir Magnus went forth upon his ride."She's a pretty girl, that niece of mine," said Sir Magnus."Uncommonly pretty," said the attache."But I believe she is engaged to some one. I quite forget who; but Iknow there is some aspirant. Therefore you had better keep your toe inyour pump, young man.""I don't know that I shall keep my toe in my pump because there isanother aspirant," said Anderson. "You rather whet my ardor, sir, to newexploits. In such circumstances one is inclined to think that theaspirant must look after himself. Not that I conceive for a moment thatMiss Mountjoy should ever look after me."When Mrs. Mountjoy came down to the drawing-room there seemed to bequite "a party" collected to enjoy the hospitality of Sir Magnus, butthere were not, in truth, many more than the usual number at the board.There were Lady Mountjoy, and Miss Abbot, and Mr. Anderson, with Mr.Montgomery Arbuthnot, the two attaches. Mr. Montgomery Arbuthnot wasespecially proud of his name, but was otherwise rather a humble youngman as an attache, having as yet been only three months with Sir Magnus,and desirous of perfecting himself in Foreign Office manners under thetuition of Mr. Anderson. Mr. Blow, Secretary of Legation, was not there.He was a married man of austere manners, who, to tell the truth, lookeddown from a considerable height, as regarded Foreign Office knowledge,upon his chief.It was Mr. Blow who did the "grinding" on behalf of the BelgianLegation, and who sometimes did not hesitate to let it be known thatsuch was the fact. Neither he nor Mrs. Blow was popular at the Embassy;or it may, perhaps, be said with more truth that the Embassy was notpopular with Mr. and Mrs. Blow. It may be stated, also, that there was aclerk attached to the establishment, Mr. Bunderdown, who had been therefor some years, and who was good-naturedly regarded by the Englishinhabitants as a third attache. Mr. Montgomery Arbuthnot did his best tolet it be understood that this was a mistake. In the small affairs ofthe legation, which no doubt did not go beyond the legation, Mr.Bunderdown generally sided with Mr. Blow. Mr. Montgomery Arbuthnot wasrecognized as a second mounted attache, though his attendance on theboulevard was not as constant as that of Mr. Anderson, in consequence,probably, of the fact that he had not a horse of his own. But there wereothers also present. There were Sir Thomas Tresham, with his wife, whohad been sent over to inquire into the iron trade of Belgium. He was alearned free-trader who could not be got to agree with the old familiarviews of Sir Magnus,--who thought that the more iron that was produced inBelgium the less would be forthcoming from England. But Sir Thomas knewbetter, and as Sir Magnus was quite unable to hold his own with thepolitical economist, he gave him many dinners and was civil to his wife.Sir Thomas, no doubt, felt that in doing so Sir Magnus did all thatcould be expected from him. Lady Tresham was a quiet little woman, whocould endure to be patronized by Lady Mountjoy without annoyance. Andthere was M. Grascour, from the Belgian Foreign Office, who spokeEnglish so much better than the other gentlemen present that a strangermight have supposed him to be a school-master whose mission it was toinstruct the English Embassy in their own language."Oh, Mrs Mountjoy, I am so ashamed of myself!" said Lady Mountjoy, asshe waddled into the room two minutes after the guests had beenassembled. She had a way of waddling that was quite her own, and whichthey who knew her best declared that she had adopted in lieu of othergraces of manner. She puffed a little also, and did contrive to attractpeculiar attention. "But I have to be in my carriage every day at thesame hour. I don't know what would be thought of us if we were absent."Then she turned, with a puff and a waddle, to Miss Abbot. "Dear LadyTresham was with us." Mrs. Mountjoy murmured something as to hersatisfaction at not having delayed the carriage-party, and bethoughtherself how exactly similar had been the excuse made by Sir Magnushimself. Then Lady Mountjoy gave another little puff, and assuredFlorence that she hoped she would find Brussels sufficiently gay,--"notthat we pretend at all to equal Paris.""We live at Cheltenham," said Florence, "and that is not at all likeParis. Indeed, I never slept but two nights at Paris in my life.""Then we shall do very well at Brussels." After this she waddled offagain, and was stopped in her waddling by Sir Magnus, who sternlydesired her to prepare for the august ceremony of going in to dinner.The one period of real importance at the English Embassy was, no doubt,the daily dinner-hour.Florence found herself seated between Mr. Anderson, who had taken herin, and M. Grascour, who had performed the same ceremony for herladyship. "I am sure you will like this little capital very much," saidM. Grascour. "It is as much nicer than Paris as it is smaller and lesspretentious." Florence could only assent. "You will soon be able tolearn something of us; but in Paris you must be to the manner born, orhalf a lifetime will not suffice.""We'll put you up to the time of day," said Mr. Anderson, who did notchoose, as he said afterward, that this tidbit should be taken out ofhis mouth."I dare say that all that I shall want will come naturally without anyputting up.""You won't find it amiss to know a little of what's what. You have notgot a riding-horse here?""Oh no," said Florence."I was going on to say that I can manage to secure one for you.Billibong has got an excellent horse that carried the Princess of Styrialast year." Mr. Anderson was supposed to be peculiarly up to everythingconcerning horses."But I have not got a habit. That is a much more serious affair.""Well, yes. Billibong does not keep habits: I wish he did. But we canmanage that too. There does live a habit-maker in Brussels.""Ladies' habits certainly are made in Brussels," said M. Grascour. "Butif Miss Mountjoy does not choose to trust a Belgian tailor there is therailway open to her. An English habit can be sent.""Dear Lady Centaur had one sent to her only last year, when she wasstaying here," said Lady Mountjoy across her neighbor, with two littlepuffs."I shall not at all want the habit," said Florence, "not having thehorse, and indeed, never being accustomed to ride at all.""Do tell me what it is that you do do," said Mr. Anderson, with aconvenient whisper, when he found that M. Grascour had fallen intoconversation with her ladyship. "Lawn-tennis?""I do play at lawn-tennis, though I am not wedded to it.""Billiards? I know you play billiards.""I never struck a ball in my life.""Goodness gracious, how odd! Don't you ever amuse yourself at all? Arethey so very devotional down at Cheltenham?""I suppose we are stupid. I don't know that I ever do especially amusemyself.""We must teach you;--we really must teach you. I think I may boast ofmyself that I am a good instructor in that line. Will you promise to putyourself into my hands?""You will find me a most unpromising pupil.""Not in the least. I will undertake that when you leave this you shallbe _au fait_ at everything. Leap frog is not too heavy for me andspillikins not too light. I am up to them all, from backgammon to acotillon,--not but what I prefer the cotillon for my own taste.""Or leap-frog, perhaps," suggested Florence."Well, yes; leap-frog used to be a good game at Gother School, and Idon't see why we shouldn't have it back again. Ladies, of course, musthave a costume on purpose. But I am fond of anything that requires acostume. Don't you like everything out of the common way? I do."Florence assured him that their tastes were wholly dissimilar, as sheliked everything in the common way. "That's what I call an uncommonlypretty girl," he said afterward to M. Grascour, while Sir Magnus wastalking to Sir Thomas. "What an eye!""Yes, indeed; she is very lovely.""My word, you may say that! And such a turn of the shoulders! I don'tsay which are the best-looking, as a rule, English or Belgians, butthere are very few of either to come up to her.""Anderson, can you tell us how many tons of steel rails they turn out atLiege every week? Sir Thomas asks me, just as though it were thesimplest question in the world.""Forty million," said Anderson,--"more or less.""Twenty thousand would, perhaps, be nearer the mark," said M. Grascour;"but I will send him the exact amount to-morrow."CHAPTER XV.MR. ANDERSON'S LOVE.Lady Mountjoy had certainly prophesied the truth when she said that Mr.Anderson would devote himself to Florence. The first week in Brusselspassed by quietly enough. A young man can hardly declare his passionwithin a week, and Mr. Anderson's ways in that particular were wellknown. A certain amount of license was usually given to him, both by SirMagnus and Lady Mountjoy, and when he would become remarkable by therapidity of his changes the only adverse criticism would come generallyfrom Mr. Blow. "Another peerless Bird of Paradise," Mr. Blow would say."If the birds were less numerous, Anderson might, perhaps, dosomething." But at the end of the week, on this occasion, even SirMagnus perceived that Anderson was about to make himself peculiar."By George!" he said one morning, when Sir Magnus had just left theouter office, which he had entered with the object of giving someinstruction as to the day's ride, "take her altogether, I never saw agirl so fit as Miss Mountjoy." There was something very remarkable inthis speech, as, according to his usual habit of life, Anderson wouldcertainly have called her Florence, whereas his present appellationshowed an unwonted respect."What do you mean when you say that a young lady is fit?" said Mr. Blow."I mean that she is right all round, which is a great deal more than canbe said of most of them.""The divine Florence--" began Mr. Montgomery Arbuthnot, struggling tosay something funny."Young man, you had better hold your tongue, and not talk of youngladies in that language.""I do believe that he is going to fall in love," said Mr. Blow."I say that Miss Mountjoy is the fittest girl I have seen for many aday; and when a young puppy calls her the divine Florence, he does notknow what he is about.""Why didn't you blow Mr. Blow up when he called her a Bird of Paradise?"said Montgomery Arbuthnot. "Divine Florence is not half so disrespectfulof a young lady as Bird of Paradise. Divine Florence means divineFlorence, but Bird of Paradise is chaff.""Mr. Blow, as a married man," said Anderson, "has a certain freedomallowed him. If he uses it in bad taste, the evil falls back upon hisown head. Now, if you please, we'll change the conversation." From thisit will be seen that Mr. Anderson had really fallen in love with MissMountjoy.But though the week had passed in a harmless way to Sir Magnus and LadyMountjoy,--in a harmless way to them as regarded their niece and theirattache,--a certain amount of annoyance had, no doubt, been felt byFlorence herself. Though Mr. Anderson's expressions of admiration hadbeen more subdued than usual, though he had endeavored to whisper hislove rather than to talk it out loud, still the admiration had been bothvisible and audible, and especially so to Florence herself. It wasnothing to Sir Magnus with whom his attache flirted. Anderson was theyounger son of a baronet who had a sickly elder brother, and somefortune of his own. If he chose to marry the girl, that would be wellfor her; and if not, it would be quite well that the young people shouldamuse themselves. He expected Anderson to help to put him on his horse,and to ride with him at the appointed hour. He, in return, gave Andersonhis dinner and as much wine as he chose to drink. They were bothsatisfied with each other, and Sir Magnus did not choose to interferewith the young man's amusements. But Florence did not like being thesubject of a young man's love-making, and complained to her mother.Now, it had come to pass that not a word had been said as to HarryAnnesley since the mother and daughter had reached Brussels. Mrs.Mountjoy had declared that she would consult her brother-in-law in thatdifficulty, but no such consultation had as yet taken place. Indeed,Florence would not have found her sojourn at Brussels to be unpleasantwere it not for Mr. Anderson's unpalatable little whispers. She hadtaken them as jokes as long as she had been able to do so, but was nowat last driven to perceive that other people would not do so. "Mamma,"she said, "don't you think that that Mr. Anderson is an odious youngman?""No, my dear, by no means. What is there odious about him? He is verylively; he is the second son of Sir Gregory Anderson, and has verycomfortable means of his own.""Oh, mamma, what does that signify?""Well, my dear, it does signify. In the first place, he is a gentleman,and in the next, has a right to make himself attentive to any young ladyin your position. I don't say anything more. I am not particularlywedded to Mr. Anderson. If he were to come to me and ask for mypermission to address you, I should simply refer him to yourself, bywhich I should mean to imply that if he could contrive to recommendhimself to you I should not refuse my sanction."Then the subject for that moment dropped, but Florence was astonished tofind that her mother could talk about it, not only without reference toHarry Annesley, but also without an apparent thought of MountjoyScarborough; and it was distressing to her to think that her mothershould pretend to feel that she, her own daughter, should be free toreceive the advances of another suitor. As she reflected it came acrossher mind that Harry was so odious that her mother would have beenwilling to accept on her behalf any suitor who presented himself, eventhough her daughter, in accepting him, should have proved herself to beheartless. Any alternative would have been better to her mother thanthat choice to which Florence had determined to devote her whole life."Mamma," she said, going back to the subject on the next day, "if I amto stay here for three weeks longer--""Yes, my dear, you are to stay here for three weeks longer.""Then somebody must say something to Mr. Anderson.""I do not see who can say it but you yourself. As far as I can see, hehas not misbehaved.""I wish you would speak to my uncle.""What am I to tell him?""That I am engaged.""He would ask me to whom, and I cannot tell him. I should then be drivento put the whole case in his hands, and to ask his advice. You do notsuppose that I am going to say that you are engaged to marry that odiousyoung man? All the world knows how atrociously badly he has behaved toyour own cousin. He left him lying for dead in the street by a blow fromhis own hand; and though from that day to this nothing has been heard ofMountjoy, nothing is known to the police of what may have been hisfate;--even stranger, he may have perished under the usage which hereceived, yet Mr. Annesley has not thought it right to say a word ofwhat had occurred. He has not dared even to tell an inspector of policethe events of that night. And the young man was your own cousin, to whomyou were known to have been promised for the last two years.""No, no!" said Florence."I say that it was so. You were promised to your cousin, MountjoyScarborough.""Not with my own consent.""All your friends,--your natural friends,--knew that it was to be so. Andnow you expect me to take by the hand this young man who has almost beenhis murderer!""No, mamma, it is not true. You do not know the circumstances, and youassert things which are directly at variance with the truth.""From whom do you get your information? From the young man himself. Isthat likely to be true? What would Sir Magnus say as to that were I totell him?""I do not know what he would say, but I do know what is the truth. Andcan you think it possible that I should now be willing to accept thisfoolish young man in order thus to put an end to my embarrassments?"Then she left her mother's room, and, retreating to her own, sat for acouple of hours thinking, partly in anger and partly in grief, of thetroubles of her situation. Her mother had now, in truth, frightened heras to Harry's position. She did begin to see what men might say of him,and the way in which they might speak of his silence, though she wasresolved to be as true to him in her faith as ever. Some exertion ofspirit would, indeed, be necessary. She was beginning to understand inwhat way the outside world might talk of Harry Annesley, of the man towhom she had given herself and her whole heart. Then her mother wasright. And as she thought of it she began to justify her mother. It wasnatural that her mother should believe the story which had been told toher, let it have come from where it might. There was in her mind somesuspicion of the truth. She acknowledged a great animosity to her cousinAugustus, and regarded him as one of the causes of her unhappiness. Butshe knew nothing of the real facts; she did not even suspect thatAugustus had seen his brother after Harry had dealt with him, or that hewas responsible for his brother's absence. But she knew that shedisliked him, and in some way she connected his name with Harry'smisfortune.Of one thing she was certain: let them,--the Mountjoys, and Prospers, andthe rest of the world,--think and say what they would of Harry, she wouldbe true to him. She could understand that his character might be made tosuffer, but it should not suffer in her estimation. Or rather, let itsuffer ever so, that should not affect her love and her truth. She didnot say this to herself. By saying it even to herself she would havecommitted some default of truth. She did not whisper it even to her ownheart. But within her heart there was a feeling that, let Harry be rightor wrong in what he had done, even let it be proved, to the satisfactionof all the world, that he had sinned grievously when he had left the manstunned and bleeding on the pavement,--for to such details her mother'sstory had gone,--still, to her he should be braver, more noble, moremanly, more worthy of being loved, than was any other man. She,perceiving the difficulties that were in store for her, and lookingforward to the misfortune under which Harry might be placed, declared toherself that he should at least have one friend who would be true tohim."Miss Mountjoy, I have come to you with a message from your aunt." Thiswas said, three or four days after the conversation between Florence andher mother, by Mr. Anderson, who had contrived to follow the young ladyinto a small drawing-room after luncheon. What was the nature of themessage it is not necessary for us to know. We may be sure that it hadbeen manufactured by Mr. Anderson for the occasion. He had looked aboutand spied, and had discovered that Miss Mountjoy was alone in the littleroom. And in thus spying we consider him to have been perfectlyjustified. His business at the moment was that of making love, abusiness which is allowed to override all other considerations. Even themaking an office copy of a report made by Mr. Blow for the signature ofSir Magnus might, according to our view of life, have been properly laidaside for such a purpose. When a young man has it in him to make love toa young lady, and is earnest in his intention, no duty, howeverparamount, should be held as a restraint. Such was Mr. Anderson'sintention at the present moment; and therefore we think that he wasjustified in concocting a message from Lady Mountjoy. The business oflove-making warrants any concoction to which the lover may resort. "Butoh, Miss Mountjoy, I am so glad to have a moment in which I can find youalone!" It must be understood that the amorous young gentleman had notyet been acquainted with the young lady for quite a fortnight."I was just about to go up-stairs to my mother," said Florence, risingto leave the room."Oh, bother your mother! I beg her pardon and yours;--I really didn'tmean it. There is such a lot of chaff going on in that outer room, thata fellow falls into the way of it whether he likes it or no.""My mother won't mind it at all; but I really must go.""Oh no. I am sure you can wait for five minutes. I don't want to keepyou for more than five minutes. But it is so hard for a fellow to get anopportunity to say a few words.""What words can you want to say to me, Mr. Anderson?" This she said witha look of great surprise, as though utterly unable to imagine what wasto follow."Well, I did hope that you might have some idea of what my feelingsare.""Not in the least.""Haven't you, now? I suppose I am bound to believe you, though I doubtwhether I quite do. Pray excuse me for saying this, but it is best to beopen." Florence felt that he ought to be excused for doubting her, asshe did know very well what was coming. "I--I--Come, then; I love you!If I were to go on beating about the bush for twelve months I could onlycome to the same conclusion.""Perhaps you might then have considered it better.""Not in the least. Fancy considering such a thing as that for twelvemonths before you speak of it! I couldn't do it,--not for twelve days.""So I perceive, Mr. Anderson.""Well, isn't it best to speak the truth when you're quite sure of it? IfI were to remain dumb for three months, how should I know but what someone else might come in the way?""But you can't expect that I should be so sudden?""That's just where it is. Of course I don't. And yet girls have to besudden too.""Have they?""They're expected to be ready with their answer as soon as they'reasked. I don't say this by way of impertinence, but merely to show thatI have some justification. Of course, if you like to say that you musttake a week to think of it, I am prepared for that. Only let me tell myown story first.""You shall tell your own story, Mr. Anderson; but I am afraid that itcan be to no purpose.""Don't say that,--pray, don't say that,--but do let me tell it." Then hepaused; but, as she remained silent, after a moment he resumed theeloquence of his appeal. "By George! Miss Mountjoy, I have been sostruck of a heap that I do not know whether I am standing on my head ormy heels. You have knocked me so completely off my pins that I am not atall like the same person. Sir Magnus himself says that he never saw sucha difference. I only say that to show that I am quite in earnest. Now Iam not quite like a fellow that has no business to fall in love with agirl. I have four hundred a year besides my place in the Foreign Office.And then, of course, there are chances." In this he alluded to hisbrother's failing health, of which he could not explain the details toMiss Mountjoy on the present occasion. "I don't mean to say that this isvery splendid, or that it is half what I should like to lay at yourfeet. But a competence is comfortable.""Money has nothing to do with it, Mr. Anderson.""What, then? Perhaps it is that you don't like a fellow. What girlsgenerally do like is devotion, and, by George, you'd have that. The veryground that you tread upon is sweet to me. For beauty,--I don't know howit is, but to my taste there is no one I ever saw at all like you. Youfit me--well, as though you were made for me. I know that another fellowmight say it a deal better, but no one more truly. Miss Mountjoy, Ilove you with all my heart, and I want you to be my wife. Now you've gotit!"He had not pleaded his cause badly, and so Florence felt. That he hadpleaded it hopelessly was a matter of course. But he had given rise tofeelings of gentle regard rather than of anger. He had been honest, andhad contrived to make her believe him. He did not come up to her idealof what a lover should be, but he was nearer to it than MountjoyScarborough. He had touched her so closely that she determined at onceto tell him the truth, thinking that she might best in this way put anend to his passion forever. "Mr. Anderson," she said, "though I haveknown it to be vain, I have thought it best to listen to you, becauseyou asked it.""I am sure I am awfully obliged to you.""And I ought to thank you for the kind feeling you have expressed to me.Indeed, I do thank you. I believe every word you have said. It is betterto show my confidence in your truth than to pretend to the humility ofthinking you untrue.""It is true; it is true,--every word of it.""But I am engaged." Then it was sad to see the thorough change whichcame over the young man's face. "Of course a girl does not talk of herown little affairs to strangers, or I would let you have known thisbefore, so as to have prevented it. But, in truth, I am engaged.""Does Sir Magnus know it, or Lady Mountjoy?""I should think not.""Does your mother?""Now you are taking advantage of my confidence, and pressing yourquestions too closely. But my mother does know of it. I will tell youmore;--she does not approve of it. But it is fixed in Heaven itself. Itmay well be that I shall never be able to marry the gentleman to whom Iallude, but most certainly I shall marry no one else. I have told youthis because it seems to be necessary to your welfare, so that you mayget over this passing feeling.""It is no passing feeling," said Anderson, with some tragic grandeur."At any rate, you have now my story, and remember that it is trusted toyou as a gentleman. I have told it you for a purpose." Then she walkedout of the room, leaving the poor young man in temporary despair.CHAPTER XVI.MR. AND MISS GREY.It was now the middle of October, and it may be said that from the timein which old Mr. Scarborough had declared his intention of showing thatthe elder of his sons had no right to the property, Mr. Grey, thelawyer, had been so occupied with the Scarborough affairs as to have hadleft him hardly a moment for other considerations.He had a partner, who during these four months had, in fact, carried onthe business. One difficulty had grown out of another till Mr. Grey'swhole time had been occupied; and all his thoughts had been filled withMr. Scarborough, which is a matter of much greater moment to a man thanthe loss of his time. The question of Mountjoy Scarborough's positionhad been first submitted to him in June. October had now been reachedand Mr. Grey had been out of town only for a fortnight, during whichfortnight he had been occupied entirely in unravelling the mystery. Hehad at first refused altogether to have anything to do with theunravelling, and had desired that some other lawyer might be employed.But it had gradually come to pass that he had entered heart and soulinto the case, and, with many execrations on his own part against Mr.Scarborough, could find a real interest in nothing else. He had begunhis investigations with a thorough wish to discover that MountjoyScarborough was, in truth, the heir. Though he had never loved the youngman, and, as he went on with his investigations, became aware that thewhole property would go to the creditors should he succeed in provingthat Mountjoy was the heir, yet for the sake of abstract honesty he wasmost anxious that it should be so. And he could not bear to think thathe and other lawyers had been taken in by the wily craft of such a manas the Squire of Tretton. It went thoroughly against the grain with himto have to acknowledge that the estate would become the property ofAugustus. But it was so, and he did acknowledge it. It was proved to himthat, in spite of all the evidence which he had hitherto seen in thematter, the squire had not married his wife until after the birth of hiseldest son. He did acknowledge it, and he said bravely that it must beso. Then there came down upon him a crowd of enemies in the guise ofbaffled creditors, all of whom believed, or professed to believe, thathe, Mr. Grey, was in league with the squire to rob them of their rights.If it could be proved that Mountjoy had no claim to the property, thenwould it go nominally to Augustus, who according to their showing wasalso one of the confederates, and the property could thus, they said, bedivided. Very shortly the squire would be dead, and then theconfederates would get everything, to the utter exclusion of poor Mr.Tyrrwhit, and poor Mr. Samuel Hart, and all the other poor creditors,who would thus be denuded, defrauded, and robbed by a lawyer's trick. Itwas in this spirit that Mr. Grey was attacked by Mr. Tyrrwhit and theothers; and Mr. Grey found it very hard to bear.And then there was another matter which was also very grievous to him.If it were as he now stated,--if the squire had been guilty of thisfraud,--to what punishment would he be subjected? Mountjoy was declaredto have been innocent. Mr. Tyrrwhit, as he put the case to his ownlawyers, laughed bitterly as he made this suggestion. And Augustus was,of course, innocent. Then there was renewed laughter. And Mr. Grey! Mr.Grey had, of course, been innocent. Then the laughter was very loud. Wasit to be believed that anybody could be taken in by such a story asthis? There was he, Mr. Tyrrwhit: he had ever been known as a sharpfellow; and Mr. Samuel Hart, who was now away on his travels, and theothers;--they were all of them sharp fellows. Was it to be believed thatsuch a set of gentlemen, so keenly alive to their own interest, shouldbe made the victims of such a trick as this? Not if they knew it! Not ifMr. Tyrrwhit knew it!It was in this shape that the matter reached Mr. Grey's ears; and thenit was asked, if it were so, what would be the punishment to which theywould be subjected who had defrauded Mr. Tyrrwhit of his just claim. Mr.Tyrrwhit, who on one occasion made his way into Mr. Grey's presence,wished to get an answer to that question from Mr. Grey. "The man isdying," said Mr. Grey, solemnly."Dying! He is not more likely to die than you are, from all I hear." Atthis time rumors of Mr. Scarborough's improved health had reached thecreditors in London. Mr. Tyrrwhit had begun to believe that Mr.Scarborough's dangerous condition had been part of the hoax; that therehad been no surgeon's knives, no terrible operations, no moment ofalmost certain death. "I don't believe he's been ill at all," said Mr.Tyrrwhit."I cannot help your belief," said Mr. Grey."But because a man doesn't die and recovers, is he on that account to beallowed to cheat people, as he has cheated me, with impunity?""I am not going to defend Mr. Scarborough; but he has not, in fact,cheated you.""Who has? Come; do you mean to tell me that if this goes on I shall nothave been defrauded of a hundred thousand pounds?""Did you ever see Mr. Scarborough on the matter?""No; it was not necessary.""Or have you got his writing to any document? Have you anything to showthat he knew what his son was doing when he borrowed money of you? Is itnot perfectly clear that he knew nothing about it?""Of course he knew nothing about it then,--at that time. It was afterwardthat his fraud began. When he found that the estate was in jeopardy,then the falsehood was concocted.""Ah, there, Mr. Tyrrwhit, I can only say, that I disagree with you. Imust express my opinion that if you endeavor to recover your money onthat plea you will be beaten. If you can prove fraud of that kind, nodoubt you can punish those who have been guilty of it,--me among thenumber.""I say nothing of that," said Mr. Tyrrwhit."But if you have been led into your present difficulty by an illegalattempt on the part of my client to prove an illegitimate son to havebeen legitimate, and then to have changed his mind for certain purposes,I do not see how you are to punish him. The act will have been attemptedand not completed. And it will have been an act concerning his son andnot concerning you.""Not concerning me!" shrieked Mr. Tyrrwhit."Certainly not, legally. You are not in a position to prove that he knewthat his son was borrowing money from you on the credit of the estate.As a fact he certainly did not know it.""We shall see about that," said Mr. Tyrrwhit."Then you must see about it, but not with my aid. As a fact I am tellingyou all that I know about it. If I could I would prove MountjoyScarborough to be his father's heir to-morrow. Indeed, I am altogetheron your side in the matter,--if you would believe it." Here Mr. Tyrrwhitagain laughed. "But you will not believe it, and I do not ask you to doso. As it is we must be opposed to each other.""Where is the young man?" asked Mr. Tyrrwhit."Ah, that is a question I am not bound to answer, even if I knew. It isa matter on which I say nothing. You have lent him money, at anexorbitant rate of interest.""It is not true.""At any rate it seems so to me; and it is out of the question that Ishould assist you in recovering it. You did it at your own peril, andnot on my advice. Good-morning, Mr. Tyrrwhit." Then Mr. Tyrrwhit wenthis way, not without sundry threats as to the whole Scarborough family.It was very hard upon Mr. Grey, because he certainly was an honest manand had taken up the matter simply with a view of learning the truth. Ithad been whispered to him within the last day or two that MountjoyScarborough had lately been seen alive, and gambling with recklessprodigality, at Monte Carlo. It had only been told to him as probablytrue, but he certainly believed it. But he knew nothing of the detailsof his disappearance, and had not been much surprised, as he had neverbelieved that the young man had been murdered or had made away withhimself. But he had heard before that of the quarrel in the streetbetween him and Harry Annesley; and the story had been told to him so asto fall with great discredit on Harry Annesley's head.According to that story Harry Annesley had struck his foe during thenight and had left him for dead upon the pavement. Then MountjoyScarborough had been missing, and Harry Annesley had told no one of thequarrel. There had been some girl in question. So much and no more Mr.Grey had heard, and was, of course, inclined to think that HarryAnnesley must have behaved very badly. But of the mode of Mountjoy'ssubsequent escape he had heard nothing.Mr. Grey at this time was living down at Fulham, in a small,old-fashioned house which over-looked the river, and was called theManor-house. He would have said that it was his custom to go home everyday by an omnibus, but he did, in truth, almost always remain at hisoffice so late as to make it necessary that he should return by a cab.He was a man fairly well to do in the world, as he had no one dependingon him but one daughter,--no one, that is to say, whom he was obliged tosupport. But he had a married sister with a scapegrace husband and sixdaughters whom, in fact, he did support. Mrs. Carroll, with the kindestintentions in the world, had come and lived near him. She had taken agenteel house in Bolsover Terrace,--a genteel new house on the FulhamRoad, about a quarter of a mile from her brother. Mr. Grey lived in theold Manor-house, a small, uncomfortable place, which had a nook of itsown, close upon the water, and with a lovely little lawn. It wascertainly most uncomfortable as a gentleman's residence, but noconsideration would induce Mr. Grey to sell it. There were but twositting-rooms in it, and one was for the most part uninhabited. Theup-stairs drawing-room was furnished, but any one with half an eye couldsee that it was never used. A "stray" caller might be shown up there,but callers of that class were very uncommon in Mr. Grey'sestablishment.With his own domestic arrangements Mr. Grey would have been quitecontented, had it not been for Mrs. Carroll. It was now some years sincehe had declared that though Mr. Carroll,--or Captain Carroll, as he hadthen been called,--was an improvident, worthless, drunken Irishman, hewould never see his sister want. The consequence was that Carroll hadcome with his wife and six daughters and taken a house close to him.There are such "whips and scorns" in the world to which a man shall beso subject as to have the whole tenor of his life changed by them. Thehero bears them heroically, making no complaints to those around him.The common man shrinks, and squeals, and cringes, so that he is known tothose around him as one especially persecuted. In this respect Mr. Greywas a grand hero. When he spoke to his friends of Mrs. Carroll hisfriends were taught to believe that his outside arrangements with hissister were perfectly comfortable. No doubt there did creep out amongthose who were most intimate with him a knowledge that Mr. Carroll,--forthe captain had, in truth, never been more than a lieutenant, and hadnow long since sold out,--was impecunious, and a trouble rather thanotherwise. But I doubt whether there was a single inhabitant of theneighborhood of Fulham who was aware that Mrs. Carroll and the MissCarrolls cost Mr. Grey on an average above six hundred a year.There was one in Mr. Grey's family to whom he was so attached that hewould, to oblige her, have thrown over the whole Carroll family; but ofthis that one person would not hear. She hated the whole Carroll familywith an almost unholy hatred, of which she herself was endeavoring torepent daily, but in vain. She could not do other than hate them, butshe could do other than allow her father to withdraw his fosteringprotection; for this one person was Mr. Grey's only daughter and his oneclose domestic associate. Miss Dorothy Grey was known well to all theneighborhood, and was both feared and revered. As we shall have much todo with her in the telling of our story, it may be well to make herstand plainly before the reader's eyes.In the first place, it must be understood that she was motherless,brotherless and sisterless. She had been Mr. Grey's only child, and hermother had been dead for fifteen or sixteen years. She was now aboutthirty years of age, but was generally regarded as ranging somewherebetween forty and fifty. "If she isn't nearer fifty than forty I'll eatmy old shoes," said a lady in the neighborhood to a gentleman. "I'veknown her these twenty years, and she's not altered in the least." AsDolly Grey had been only ten twenty years ago, the lady must have beenwrong. But it is singular how a person's memory of things may be createdout of their present appearances. Dorothy herself had apparently nodesire to set right this erroneous opinion which the neighborhoodentertained respecting her. She did not seem to care whether she wassupposed to be thirty, or forty, or fifty. Of youth, as a means ofgetting lovers, she entertained a profound contempt. That no lover wouldever come she was assured, and would not at all have known what to dowith one had he come. The only man for whom she had ever felt theslightest regard was her father. For some women about she did entertaina passionless, well-regulated affection, but they were generally thepoor, the afflicted, or the aged. It was, however, always necessary thatthe person so signalized should be submissive. Now, Mrs. Carroll, Mr.Grey's sister, had long since shown that she was not submissive enough,nor were the girls, the eldest of whom was a pert, ugly, well-grownminx, now about eighteen years old. The second sister, who wasseventeen, was supposed to be a beauty, but which of the two was themore odious in the eyes of their cousin it would be impossible to say.Miss Dorothy Grey was Dolly only to her father. Had any one else soventured to call her she would have started up at once, the outragedaged female of fifty. Even her aunt, who was trouble enough to her, feltthat it could not be so. Her uncle tried it once, and she declined tocome into his presence for a month, letting it be fully understood thatshe had been insulted.And yet she was not, according to my idea, by any means an ill-favoredyoung woman. It is true that she wore spectacles; and, as she alwaysdesired to have her eyes about with her, she never put them off when outof bed. But how many German girls do the like, and are not accounted forthat reason to be plain? She was tall and well-made, we may almost sayrobust. She had the full use of all her limbs, and was never ashamed ofusing them. I think she was wrong when she would be seen to wheel thebarrow about the garden, and that her hands must have suffered in herattempts to live down the conventional absurdities of the world. It istrue that she did wear gloves during her gardening, but she wore themonly in obedience to her father's request. She had bright eyes, somewhatfar apart, and well-made, wholesome, regular features. Her nose waslarge, and her mouth was large, but they were singularly intelligent,and full of humor when she was pleased in conversation. As to her hair,she was too indifferent to enable one to say that it was attractive; butit was smoothed twice a day, was very copious, and always very clean.Indeed, for cleanliness from head to foot she was a model. "She is veryclean, but then it's second to nothing to her," had said a sarcastic oldlady, who had meant to imply that Miss Dorothy Grey was not constant atchurch. But the sarcastic old lady had known nothing about it. DorothyGrey never stayed away from morning church unless her presence wasdesired by her father, and for once or twice that she might do so shewould take her father with her three or four times,--against the grainwith him, it must be acknowledged.But the most singular attribute of the lady's appearance has still to bementioned. She always wore a slouch hat, which from motives of proprietyshe called her bonnet, which gave her a singular appearance, as thoughit had been put on to thatch her entirely from the weather. It was madegenerally of black straw, and was round, equal at all points of thecircle, and was fastened with broad brown ribbons. It was supposed inthe neighborhood to be completely weather-tight.The unimaginative nature of Fulham did not allow the Fulham mind togather in the fact that, at the same time, she might possess two orthree such hats. But they were undoubtedly precisely similar, and shewould wear them in London with exactly the same indifference as in thecomparatively rural neighborhood of her own residence. She would, intruth, go up and down in the omnibus, and would do so alone, without theslightest regard to the opinion of any of her neighbors. The Carrollgirls would laugh at her behind her back, but no Carroll girl had beenseen ever to smile before her face, instigated to do so by theircousin's vagaries.But I have not yet mentioned that attribute of Miss Grey's which is,perhaps, the most essential in her character. It is necessary, at anyrate, that they should know it who wish to understand her nature. Whenit had once been brought home to her that duty required her to do thisthing or the other, or to say this word or another, the thing would bedone or the word said, let the result be what it might. Even to thedispleasure of her father the word was said or the thing was done. Sucha one was Dolly Grey.CHAPTER XVII.MR. GREY DINES AT HOME.Mr. Grey returned home in a cab on the day of Mr. Tyrrwhit's visit, notin the happiest humor. Though he had got the best of Mr. Tyrrwhit in theconversation, still, the meeting, which had been protracted, had annoyedhim. Mr. Tyrrwhit had made accusations against himself personally whichhe knew to be false, but which, having been covered up, and notexpressed exactly, he had been unable to refute. A man shall tell youyou are a thief and a scoundrel in such a manner as to make itimpossible for you to take him by the throat. "You, of course, are not athief and a scoundrel," he shall say to you, but shall say it in such atone of voice as to make you understand that he conceives you to beboth. We all know the parliamentary mode of giving an opponent the lieso as to make it impossible that the Speaker shall interfere.Mr. Tyrrwhit had treated Mr. Grey in the same fashion; and as Mr. Greywas irritable, thin-skinned, and irascible, and as he would brood overthings of which it was quite unnecessary that a lawyer should take anycognizance, he went back home an unhappy man. Indeed, the wholeScarborough affair had been from first to last a great trouble to him.The work which he was now performing could not, he imagined, be put intohis bill. To that he was supremely indifferent; but his younger partnerthought it a little hard that all the other work of the firm should bethrown on his shoulders during the period which naturally would havebeen his holidays, and he did make his feelings intelligible to Mr.Grey. Mr. Grey, who was essentially a just man, saw that his partner wasright, and made offers, but he would not accede to the only propositionwhich his partner made. "Let him go and look for a lawyer elsewhere,"said his partner. They both of them knew that Mr. Scarborough had beenthoroughly dishonest, but he had been an old client. His father beforehim had been a client of Mr. Grey's father. It was not in accordancewith Mr. Grey's theory to treat the old man after this fashion. And hehad taken intense interest in the matter. He had, first of all, beenquite sure that Mountjoy Scarborough was the heir; and though MountjoyScarborough was not at all to his taste, he had been prepared to fightfor him. He had now assured himself, after most laborious inquiry, thatAugustus Scarborough was the heir; and although, in the course of thebusiness, he had come to hate the cautious, money-loving Augustus twiceworse than the gambling spendthrift Mountjoy, still, in the cause ofhonesty and truth and justice, he fought for Augustus against the worldat large, and against the band of creditors, till the world at large andthe band of creditors began to think that he was leagued withAugustus,--so as to be one of those who would make large sums of moneyout of the irregularity of the affair. This made him cross, and put himinto a very bad humor as he went back to Fulham.One thing must be told of Mr. Grey which was very much to his discredit,and which, if generally known, would have caused his clients to thinkhim to be unfit to be the recipient of their family secrets;--he told allthe secrets to Dolly. He was a man who could not possibly be induced toleave his business behind him at his office. It made the chief subjectof conversation when he was at home. He would even call Dolly into hisbedroom late at night, bringing her out of bed for the occasion, todiscuss with her some point of legal strategy,--of legal but still honeststrategy,--which had just occurred to him. Maybe he had not quite seenhis way as to the honesty, and wanted Dolly's opinion on the subject.Dolly would come in in her dressing-gown, and, sitting on his bed, woulddiscuss the matter with him as advocate against the devil. Sometimes shewould be convinced; more frequently she would hold her own. But thepoints which were discussed in that way, and the strength ofargumentation which was used on either side, would have surprised theclients, and the partner, and the clerks, and the eloquent barrister whowas occasionally employed to support this side or the other. Theeloquent barrister, or it might be the client himself, startledsometimes at the amount of enthusiasm which Mr. Grey would throw intohis argument, would little dream that the very words had come from theyoung lady in her dressing-gown. To tell the truth, Miss Grey thoroughlyliked these discussions, whether held on the lawn, or in thedining-room arm-chairs, or during the silent hours of the night. Theyformed, indeed, the very salt of her life. She felt herself to be theConscience of the firm. Her father was the Reason. And the partner, inher own phraseology, was the--Devil. For it must be understood thatDolly Grey had a spice of fun about her, of which her father had thefull advantage. She would not have called her father's partner the"Devil" to any other ear but her father's. And that her father knew,understanding also the spirit in which the sobriquet had been applied.He did not think that his partner was worse than another man, nor did hethink that his daughter so thought. The partner, whose name was Barry,was a man of average honesty, who would occasionally be surprised at thesearching justness with which Mr. Grey would look into a matter after ithad been already debated for a day or two in the office. But Mr. Barry,though he had the pleasure of Miss Grey's acquaintance, had no idea ofthe nature of the duties which she performed in the firm."I'm nearly broken-hearted about this abominable business," said Mr.Grey, as he went upstairs to his dressing room. The normal hour fordinner was half-past six. He had arrived on this occasion at half-pastseven, and had paid a shilling extra to the cabman to drive him quick.The man, having a lame horse, had come very slowly, fidgeting Mr. Greyinto additional temporary discomfort. He had got his additionalshilling, and Mr. Grey had only additional discomfort. "I declare Ithink he is the wickedest old man the world ever produced." This he saidas Dolly followed him upstairs; but Dolly, wiser than her father, wouldsay nothing about the wicked old man in the servants' hearing.In five minutes Mr. Grey came down "dressed,"--by the use of which wordwas implied the fact that he had shaken his neckcloth, washed his handsand face, and put on his slippers. It was understood in the householdthat, though half-past six was the hour named for dinner, half-pastseven was a much more probable time. Mr. Grey pertinaciously refused tohave it changed."Stare super vias antiquas," he had stoutly said when the propositionhad been made to him; by which he had intended to imply that, as duringthe last twenty years he had been compelled to dine at half-past sixinstead of six, he did not mean to be driven any farther in the samedirection. Consequently his cook was compelled to prepare his dinner insuch a manner that it might be eaten at one hour or the other, as chancewould have it.The dinner passed without much conversation other than incidental toMr. Grey's wants and comforts. His daughter knew that he had been at theoffice for eight hours, and knew also that he was not a young man. Everykind of little cosseting was, therefore, applied to him. There was apheasant for dinner, and it was essentially necessary, in Dolly'sopinion, that he should have first the wing, quite hot, and then theleg, also hot, and that the bread-sauce should be quite hot on the twooccasions. For herself, if she had had an old crow for dinner it wouldhave been the same thing. Tea and bread-and-butter were her luxuries,and her tea and bread-and-butter had been enjoyed three hours ago. "Ideclare I think that, after all, the leg is the better joint of thetwo.""Then why don't you have the two legs?""There would be a savor of greediness in that, though I know that theleg will go down,--and I shouldn't then be able to draw the comparison. Ilike to have them both, and I like always to be able to assert myopinion that the leg is the better joint. Now, how about theapple-pudding? You said I should have an apple-pudding." From which itappeared that Mr. Grey was not superior to having the dinner discussedin his presence at the breakfast-table. The apple-pudding came, and wasapparently enjoyed. A large portion of it was put between two plates."That's for Mrs. Grimes," suggested Mr. Grey. "I am not quite sure thatMrs. Grimes is worthy of it." "If you knew what it was to be leftwithout a shilling of your husband's wages you'd think yourself worthy."When the conversation about the pudding was over Mr. Grey ate hischeese, and then sat quite still in his arm-chair over the fire whilethe things were being taken away. "I declare I think he is the wickedestman the world has ever produced," said Mr. Grey as soon as the door wasshut, thus showing by the repetition of the words he had before usedthat his mind had been intent on Mr. Scarborough rather than on thepheasant."Why don't you have done with them?""That's all very well; but you wouldn't have done with them if you hadknown them all your life.""I wouldn't spend my time and energies in white-washing any rascal,"said Dolly, with vigor."You don't know what you'd do. And a man isn't to be left in the lurchaltogether because he's a rascal. Would you have a murderer hangedwithout some one to stand up for him?""Yes, I would," said Dolly, thoughtlessly."And he mightn't have been a murderer after all; or not legally so,which as far as the law goes is the same thing."But this special question had been often discussed between them, and Mr.Grey and Dolly did not intend to be carried away by it on the presentoccasion. "I know all about that," she said; "but this isn't a case oflife and death. The old man is only anxious to save his property, andthrows upon you all the burden of doing it. He never agrees with you asto anything you say.""As to legal points he does.""But he keeps you always in hot water, and puts forward so much villanythat I would have nothing farther to do with him. He has been so craftythat you hardly know now which is, in truth, the heir.""Oh yes, I do," said the lawyer. "I know very well, and am very sorrythat it should be so. And I cannot but feel for the rascal because thedishonest effort was made on behalf of his own son.""Why was it necessary?" said Dolly, with sparks flying from her eye."Throughout from the beginning he has been bad. Why was the woman nothis wife?""Ah! why, indeed. But had his sin consisted only in that, I should nothave dreamed of refusing my assistance as a family lawyer. All thatwould have gone for nothing then.""When evil creeps in," said Dolly, sententiously, "you cannot put itright afterward.""Never mind about that. We shall never get to the end if you go back toAdam and Eve.""People don't go back often enough.""Bother!" said Mr. Grey, finishing his second and last glass ofport-wine. "Do keep yourself in some degree to the question in dispute.In advising an attorney of to-day as to how he is to treat a client youcan't do any good by going back to Adam and Eve. Augustus is the heir,and I am bound to protect the property for him from these money-lendingharpies. The moment the breath is out of the old man's body they willsettle down upon it if we leave them an inch of ground on which tostand. Every detail of his marriage must be made as clear as daylight;and that must be done in the teeth of former false statements.""As far as I can see, the money-lending harpies are the honestest lot ofpeople concerned.""The law is not on their side. They have got no right. The estate, as afact, will belong to Augustus the moment his father dies. Mr.Scarborough endeavored to do what he could for him whom he regarded ashis eldest son. It was very wicked. He was adding a second and a worsecrime to the first. He was flying in the face of the laws of hiscountry. But he was successful; and he threw dust into my eyes, becausehe wanted to save the property for the boy. And he endeavored to make itup to his second son by saving for him a second property. He was notselfish; and I cannot but feel for him.""But you say he is the wickedest man the world ever produced.""Because he boasts of it all, and cannot be got in any way to repent. Hegives me my instructions as though from first to last he had been ahighly honorable man, and only laughs at me when I object. And yet hemust know that he may die any day. He only wishes to have this matterset straight so that he may die. I could forgive him altogether if hewould but once say that he was sorry for what he'd done. But he hascompletely the air of the fine old head of a family who thinks he is tobe put into marble the moment the breath is out of his body, and that herichly deserves the marble he is to be put into.""That is a question between him and his God," said Dolly."He hasn't got a God. He believes only in his own reason,--and is contentto do so, lying there on the very brink of eternity. He is quite contentwith himself, because he thinks that he has not been selfish. He caresnothing that he has robbed every one all round. He has no reverence forproperty and the laws which govern it. He was born only with thelife-interest, and he has determined to treat it as though thefee-simple had belonged to him. It is his utter disregard for law, forwhat the law has decided, which makes me declare him to have been thewickedest man the world ever produced.""It is his disregard for truth which makes you think so.""He cares nothing for truth. He scorns it and laughs at it. And yetabout the little things of the world he expects his word to be taken ascertainly as that of any other gentleman.""I would not take it.""Yes, you would, and would be right too. If he would say he'd pay me ahundred pounds to-morrow, or a thousand, I would have his word as soonas any other man's bond. And yet he has utterly got the better of me,and made me believe that a marriage took place, when there was nomarriage. I think I'll have a cup of tea.""You won't go to sleep, papa?""Oh yes, I shall. When I've been so troubled as that I must have a cupof tea." Mr. Grey was often troubled, and as a consequence Dolly wascalled up for consultations in the middle of the night.At about one o'clock there came the well-known knock at Dolly's door andthe usual invitation. Would she come into her father's room for a fewminutes? Then her father trotted back to his bed, and Dolly, of course,followed him as soon as she had clothed herself decently."Why didn't you tell me?""I thought I had made up my mind not to go; or I thought rather that Ishould be able to make up my mind not to go. But it is possible thatdown there I may have some effect for good.""What does he want of you?""There is a long question about raising money with which Augustusdesires to buy the silence of the creditors.""Could he get the money?" asked Dolly."Yes, I think he could. The property at present is altogetherunembarrassed. To give Mr. Scarborough his due, he has never put hisname to a scrap of paper; nor has he had occasion to do so. The Trettonpottery people want more land, or rather more water, and a large sum ofmoney will be forthcoming. But he doesn't see the necessity of givingMr. Tyrrwhit a penny-piece, or certainly Mr. Hart. He would send themaway howling without a scruple. Now, Augustus is anxious to settle withthem, for some reason which I do not clearly understand. But he wishesto do so without any interference on his father's part. In fact, he andhis father have very different ideas as to the property. The squireregards it as his, but Augustus thinks that any day may make it his own.In fact, they are on the very verge of quarrelling." Then, after a longdebate, Dolly consented that her father should go down to Tretton, andact, if possible, the part of peace-maker.CHAPTER XVIII.THE CARROLL FAMILY."Aunt Carroll is coming to dinner to-day," said Dolly the next day, witha serious face."I know she is. Have a nice dinner for her. I don't think she ever has anice dinner at home.""And the three eldest girls are coming.""Three!""You asked them yourself on Sunday.""Very well. They said their papa would be away on business." It wasunderstood that Mr. Carroll was never asked to the Manor-house."Business! There is a club he belongs to where he dines and gets drunkonce a month. It's the only thing he does regularly.""They must have their dinner, at any rate," said Mr. Grey. "I don'tthink they should suffer because he drinks." This had been a subjectmuch discussed between them, but on the present occasion Miss Grey wouldnot renew it. She despatched her father in a cab, the cab having beenprocured because he was supposed to be a quarter of an hour late, andthen went to work to order her dinner.It has been said that Miss Grey hated the Carrolls; but she hated thedaughters worse than the mother, and of all the people she hated in theworld she hated Amelia Carroll the worst. Amelia, the eldest,entertained an idea that she was more of a personage in the world's eyesthan her cousin,--that she went to more parties, which certainly was trueif she went to any,--that she wore finer clothes, which was also true,and that she had a lover, whereas Dolly Grey,--as she called her cousinbehind her back,--had none. This lover had something to do with horses,and had only been heard of, had never been seen, at the Manor-house.Sophy was a good deal hated also, being a forward, flirting, tricky girlof seventeen, who had just left the school at which Uncle John had paidfor her education. Georgina, the third, was still at school undersimilar circumstances, and was pardoned her egregious noisiness andromping propensities under the score of youth. She was sixteen, and waspossessed of terrible vitality. "I am sure they take after their fatheraltogether," Mr. Grey had once said when the three left the Manor-housetogether. At half-past six punctually they came. Dolly heard a greatclatter of four people leaving their clogs and cloaks in the hall, andwould not move out of the unused drawing-room, in which for the momentshe was seated. Betsey had to prepare the dinner-table down-stairs, andwould have been sadly discomfited had she been driven to do it in thepresence of three Carroll girls. For it must be understood that Betseyhad no greater respect for the Carroll girls than her mistress. "Well,Aunt Carroll, how does the world use you?""Very badly. You haven't been up to see me for ten days.""I haven't counted; but when I do come I don't often do any good. Howare Minna, and Brenda, and Potsey?""Poor Potsey has got a nasty boil under her arm.""It comes from eating too much toffy," said Georgina. "I told her itwould.""How very nasty you are!" said Miss Carroll. "Do leave the child and herailments alone!""Poor papa isn't very well, either," said Sophy, who was supposed to beher father's pet."I hope his state of health will not debar him from dining with hisfriends to-night," said Miss Grey."You have always something ill-natured to say about papa," said Sophy."Nothing will ever keep him back when conviviality demands hispresence." This came from his afflicted wife, who, in spite of all hismisfortunes, would ever speak with some respect of her husband'semployments. "He wasn't at all in a fit state to go to-night, but he hadpromised, and that was enough."When they had waited three-quarters of an hour Amelia began tocomplain,--certainly not without reason. "I wonder why Uncle John alwayskeeps us waiting in this way?""Papa has, unfortunately, something to do with his time, which is notaltogether his own." There was not much in these words, but the tone inwhich they were uttered would have crushed any one more susceptible thanAmelia Carroll. But at that moment the cab arrived, and Dolly went downto meet her father."Have they come?" he asked."Come," she answered, taking his gloves and comforter from him, andgiving him a kiss as she did so. "That girl up-stairs is nearlyfamished.""I won't be half a moment," said the repentant father, hasteningup-stairs to go through his ordinary dressing arrangement."I wouldn't hurry for her," said Dolly; "but of course you'll hurry.You always do, don't you, papa?" Then they sat down to dinner."Well, girls, what is your news?""We were out to-day on the Brompton Road," said the eldest, "and therecame up Prince Chitakov's drag with four roans.""Prince Chitakov! I didn't know there was such a prince.""Oh, dear, yes; with very stiff mustaches, turned up high at thecorners, and pink cheeks, and a very sharp, nobby-looking hat, with alight-colored grey coat, and light gloves. You must know the prince.""Upon my word, I never heard of him, my dear. What did the prince do?""He was tooling his own drag, and he had a lady with him on the box. Inever saw anything more tasty than her dress,--dark red silk, with littlefluffy fur ornaments all over it. I wonder who she was?""Mrs. Chitakov, probably," said the attorney."I don't think the prince is a married man," said Sophy."They never are, for the most part," said Amelia; "and she wouldn't beMrs. Chitakov, Uncle John.""Wouldn't she, now? What would she be? Can either of you tell me whatthe wife of a Prince of Chitakov would call herself?""Princess of Chitakov, of course," said Sophy. "It's the Princess ofWales.""But it isn't the Princess of Christian, nor yet the Princess of Teck,nor the Princess of England. I don't see why the lady shouldn't be Mrs.Chitakov, if there is such a lady.""Papa, don't bamboozle her," said his daughter."But," continued the attorney, "why shouldn't the lady have been hiswife? Don't married ladies wear little fluffy fur ornaments?""I wish, John, you wouldn't talk to the girls in that strain," saidtheir mother. "It really isn't becoming.""To suggest that the lady was the gentleman's wife?""But I was going to say," continued Amelia, "that as the prince drove byhe kissed his hand--he did, indeed. And Sophy and I were walking alongas demurely as possible. I never was so knocked of a heap in all mylife.""He did," said Sophy. "It's the most impertinent thing I ever heard. Ifmy father had seen it he'd have had the prince off the box of the coachin no time.""Then, my dear," said the attorney, "I am very glad that your fatherdid not see it." Poor Dolly, during this conversation about the prince,sat angry and silent, thinking to herself in despair of what extremes ofvulgarity even a first cousin of her own could be guilty. That sheshould be sitting at table with a girl who could boast that a reprobateforeigner had kissed his hand to her from the box of a fashionablefour-horsed coach! For it was in that light that Miss Grey regarded it."And did you have any farther adventures besides this memorableencounter with the prince?""Nothing nearly so interesting," said Sophy."That was hardly to be expected," said the attorney. "Jane, you willhave a glass of port-wine? Girls, you must have a glass of port-wine tosupport you after your disappointment with the prince.""We were not disappointed in the least," said Amelia."Pray, pray, let the subject drop," said Dolly."That is because the prince did not kiss his hand to you," said Sophy.Then Miss Grey sunk again into silence, crushed beneath this last blow.In the evening, when the dinner-things had been taken away, a matter ofbusiness came up, and took the place of the prince and his mustaches.Mrs. Carroll was most anxious to know whether her brother could "lend"her a small sum of twenty pounds. It came out in conversation that thesmall sum was needed to satisfy some imperious demand made upon Mr.Carroll by a tailor. "He must have clothes, you know," said the poorwoman, wailing. "He doesn't have many, but he must have some." There hadbeen other appeals on the same subject made not very long since, and, totell the truth, Mr. Grey did require to have the subject argued, in fearof the subsequent remarks which would be made to him afterward by hisdaughter if he gave the money too easily. The loan had to be arranged infull conclave, as otherwise Mrs. Carroll would have found it difficultto obtain access to her brother's ear. But the one auditor whom shefeared was her niece. On the present occasion Miss Grey simply took upher book to show that the subject was one which had no interest for her;but she did undoubtedly listen to all that was said on the subject."There was never anything settled about poor Patrick's clothes," saidMrs. Carroll, in a half-whisper. She did not care how much her ownchildren heard, and she knew how vain it was to attempt so to speak thatDolly should not hear."I dare say something ought to be done at some time," said Mr. Grey, whoknew that he would be told, when the evening was over, that he wouldgive away all his substance to that man if he were asked."Papa has not had a new pair of trousers this year," said Sophy."Except those green ones he wore at the races," said Georgina."Hold your tongue, miss!" said her mother. "That was a pair I made upfor him and sent them to the man to get pressed.""When the hundred a year was arranged for all our dresses," said Amelia,"not a word was said about papa. Of course, papa is a trouble.""I don't see that he is more of a trouble than any one else," saidSophy. "Uncle John would not like not to have any clothes.""No, I should not, my dear.""And his own income is all given up to the house uses." Here Sophytouched imprudently on a sore subject. His "own" income consisted ofwhat had been saved out of his wife's fortune, and was thus named as inopposition to the larger sum paid to Mrs. Carroll by Mr. Grey. There wasone hundred and fifty pounds a year coming from settled property, whichhad been preserved by the lawyer's care, and which was regarded in thefamily as "papa's own."It certainly is essential for respectability that something should beset apart from a man's income for his wearing apparel; and though themoney was, perhaps, improperly so designated, Dolly would not haveobjected had she not thought that it had already gone to therace-course,--in company with the green trousers. She had her own meansof obtaining information as to the Carroll family. It was very necessarythat she should do so, if the family was to be kept on its legs at all."I don't think any good can come from discussing what my uncle does withthe money." This was Dolly's first speech. "If he is to have it, let himhave it, but let him have as little as possible.""I never heard anybody so cross as you always are to papa," said Sophy."Your cousin Dorothy is very fortunate," said Mrs. Carroll. "She doesnot know what it is to want for anything.""She never spends anything--on herself," said her father. "It is Dolly'sonly fault that she won't.""Because she has it all done for her," said Amelia.Dolly had gone back to her book, and disdained to make any fartherreply. Her father felt that quite enough had been said about it, andwas prepared to give the twenty pounds, under the idea that he might bethought to have made a stout fight upon the subject. "He does want themvery badly--for decency's sake," said the poor wife, thus winding up herplea. Then Mr. Grey got out his check-book and wrote the check fortwenty pounds. But he made it payable, not to Mr. but to Mrs. Carroll."I suppose, papa, nothing can be done about Mr. Carroll." This was saidby Dolly as soon as the family had withdrawn."In what way 'done,' my dear?""As to settling some farther sum for himself.""He'd only spend it, my dear.""That would be intended," said Dolly."And then he would come back just the same.""But in that case he should have nothing more. Though they were todeclare that he hadn't a pair of trousers in which to appear at arace-course, he shouldn't have it.""My dear," said Mr. Grey, "you cannot get rid of the gnats of the world.They will buzz and sting and be a nuisance. Poor Jane suffers worse fromthis gnat than you or I. Put up with it; and understand in your own mindthat when he comes for another twenty pounds he must have it. Youneedn't tell him, but so it must be.""If I had my way," said Dolly, after ten minutes' silence, "I wouldpunish him. He is an evil thing, and should be made to reap the properreward. It is not that I wish to avoid my share of the world's burdens,but that justice should be done. I don't know which I hate theworst,--Uncle Carroll or Mr. Scarborough."The next day was Sunday, and Dolly was very anxious before breakfast toinduce her father to say that he would go to church with her; but he wasinclined to be obstinate, and fell back upon his usual excuse, sayingthat there were Scarborough papers which it would be necessary that heshould read before he started for Tretton on the following day."Papa, I think it would do you good if you came.""Well, yes; I suppose it would. That is the intention; but somehow itfails with me sometimes.""Do you think that you hate people when you go to church as much as whenyou don't?""I am not sure that I hate anybody very much.""I do.""That seems an argument for your going.""But if you don't hate them it is because you won't take the trouble,and that again is not right. If you would come to church you would bebetter for it all round. You'd hate Uncle Carroll's idleness andabominable self-indulgence worse than you do.""I don't love him, as it is, my dear.""And I should hate him less. I felt last night as though I could risefrom my bed and go and murder him.""Then you certainly ought to go to church.""And you had passed him off just as though he were a gnat from which youwere to receive as little annoyance as possible, forgetting theinfluence he must have on those six unfortunate children. Don't you knowthat you gave her that twenty pounds simply to be rid of a disagreeablesubject?""I should have given it ever so much sooner, only that you were lookingat me.""I know you would, you dear, sweet, kind-hearted, but most un-Christian,father. You must come to church, in order that some idea of whatChristianity demands of you may make its way into your heart. It is notwhat the clergyman may say of you, but that your mind will get away fortwo hours from that other reptile and his concerns." Then Mr. Grey, witha loud, long sigh, allowed his boots, and his gloves, and hischurch-going hat, and his church-going umbrella to be brought to him. Itwas, in fact, his aversion to these articles that Dolly had toencounter.It may be doubted whether the church services of that day did Mr. Greymuch good; but they seemed to have had some effect upon his daughter,from the fact that in the afternoon she wrote a letter in kindly wordsto her aunt: "Papa is going to Tretton, and I will come up to you onTuesday. I have got a frock which I will bring with me as a present forPotsey; and I will make her sew on the buttons for herself. Tell Minna Iwill lend her that book I spoke of. About those boots--I will go withGeorgina to the boot-maker." But as to Amelia and Sophy she could notbring herself to say a good-natured word, so deep in her heart had sunkthat sin of which they had been guilty with reference to PrinceChitakov.On that night she had a long discussion with her father respecting theaffairs of the Scarborough family. The discussion was held in thedining-room, and may, therefore, be supposed to have been premeditated.Those at night in Mr. Grey's own bedroom were generally the result ofsudden thought. "I should lay down the law to him--" began Dolly."The law is the law," said her father."I don't mean the law in that sense. I should tell him firmly what Iadvised, and should then make him understand that if he did not followmy advice I must withdraw. If his son is willing to pay thesemoney-lenders what sums they have actually advanced, and if by anyeffort on his part the money can be raised, let it be done. There seemsto be some justice in repaying out of the property that which was lentto the property when by Mr. Scarborough's own doing the property wassupposed to go into the eldest son's hands. Though the eldest son andthe money-lenders be spendthrifts and profligates alike, there will inthat be something of fairness. Go there prepared with your opinion. Butif either father or son will not accept it, then depart, and shake thedust from your feet.""You propose it all as though it were the easiest thing in the world.""Easy or difficult. I would not discuss anything of which the justicemay hereafter be disputed."What was the result of the consultation on Mr. Grey's mind he did notdeclare, but he resolved to take his daughter's advice in all that shesaid to him.CHAPTER XIX.MR. GREY GOES TO TRETTON.Mr. Grey went down to Tretton with a great bag of papers. In fact,though he told his daughter that he had to examine them all before hestarted, and had taken them to Fulham for that purpose, he had notlooked at them. And, as another fact, the bag was not opened till he gothome again. They had been read;--at any rate, what was necessary. He knewhis subject. The old squire knew it well.Mr. Grey was going down to Tretton, not to convey facts or to explainthe law, but in order that he might take the side either of the fatheror of the son. Mr. Scarborough had sent for the lawyer to support hisview of the case; and the son had consented to meet him in order that hemight the more easily get the better of his father.Mr. Grey had of late learned one thing which had before been dark tohim,--had seen one phase of this complicated farrago of dishonesty whichhad not before been visible to him. Augustus suspected his father ofsome farther treachery. That he should be angry at having been debarredfrom his birthright so long,--debarred from the knowledge of hisbirthright,--was, Mr. Grey thought, natural. A great wrong had been, atleast, intended; and that such a man should resent it was to have beenexpected. But of late Mr. Grey had discovered that it was not in thatway that the son's mind worked. It was not anger but suspicion that heshowed; and he used his father's former treatment of him as ajustification for the condemnation implied in his thoughts. There is noknowing what an old man may do who has already acted as he had done. Itwas thus that he expressed himself both by his words and deeds, and didso openly in his father's presence, Mr. Grey had not seen them together,but knew from the letters of both of them that such was the case. OldMr. Scarborough scorned his son's suspicions, and disregarded altogetherany words that might be said as to his own past conduct. He was willing,or half willing, that Mountjoy's debts should be, not paid, but settled.But he was willing to do nothing toward such a step except in his ownway. While the breath was in his body the property was his, and he choseto be treated as its only master. If Augustus desired to do anything by"post-obits," let him ruin himself after his own fashion. "It is notvery likely that Augustus can raise money by post obits, circumstancedas the property is," he had written to Mr. Grey, with a conveyed sneerand chuckle as to the success of his own villany. It was as though hehad declared that the money-lenders had been too well instructed as towhat tricks Mr. Scarborough could play with his property to risk asecond venture.Augustus had, in truth, been awaiting his father's death with greatimpatience. It was unreasonable that a man should live who had acted insuch a way and who had been so cut about by the doctors. His father'sdemise had, in truth, been promised to him, and to all the world. It wasan understood thing, in all circles which knew anything, that old Mr.Scarborough could not live another month. It had been understood sometime, and was understood at the present moment; and yet Mr. Scarboroughwent on living,--no doubt, as an invalid in the last stage of probabledissolution, but still with the full command of his intellect and mentalpowers for mischief. Augustus, suspecting him as he did, had begun tofear that he might live too long. His brother had disappeared, and hewas the heir. If his father would die,--such had been his firstthought,--he could settle with the creditors immediately, before anytidings should be heard of his brother. But tidings had come. Hisbrother had been seen by Mr. Hart at Monte Carlo; and though Mr. Harthad not yet sent home the news to the other creditors, the news had beensent at once to Augustus Scarborough by his own paid attendant upon hisbrother. Of Mr. Hart's "little game" he did not yet know theparticulars; but he was confident that there was some game.Augustus by no means gave his mother credit for the disgraceful conductimputed to her in the story as now told by her surviving husband. It wasnot that he believed in the honesty of his mother, whom he had neverknown, and for whose memory he cared little, but that he believed sofully in the dishonesty of his father. His father, when he hadthoroughly understood that Mountjoy had enveloped the property in debt,so that nothing but a skeleton would remain when the bonds were paid,had set to work, and by the ingenuity of his brain had resolved toredeem, as far as the Scarboroughs were concerned, their estate from itsunfortunate position.It was so that Augustus believed; this was the theory existing in hismind. That his father should have been so clever, and Mr. Grey so blind,and even Mr. Hart and Mr. Tyrrwhit so easily hoodwinked, was remarkable.But so it was,--or might probably be so. He felt no assurance, but therewas ever present to him the feeling of great danger. But the state ofthings as arranged by his father might be established by himself. If hecould get these creditors to give up their bonds while his father'sfalsehood was still believed, it would be a great thing. He had learnedby degrees how small a proportion of the money claimed had, in fact,been advanced to Mountjoy, and had resolved to confine himself to payingthat. That might now probably be accepted with gratitude. The increasingvalue of the estate might bear that without being crushed. But it shouldbe done at once, while Mountjoy was still absent and before Mr. Tyrrwhitat any rate knew that Mountjoy had not been killed. Then had happenedthat accidental meeting with Mr. Hart at Monte Carlo. That idiot of akeeper of his had been unable to keep Mountjoy from the gambling-house.But Mr. Hart had as yet told nothing. Mr. Hart was playing some game ofhis own, in which he would assuredly be foiled. The strong hold whichAugustus had was in the great infirmity of his father and in theblindness of Mr. Grey, but it would be settled. It ought to have beenwell that the thing should be settled already by his father's death.Augustus did feel strongly that the squire ought to complete his work bydying. Were the story, as now told by him, true, he ought certainly todie, so as to make speedy atonement for his wickedness. Were it false,then he ought to go quickly, so that the lie might be effectual. Everyday that he continued to live would go far to endanger the discovery.Augustus felt that he must at once have the property in his own hands,so as to buy the creditors and obtain security.Mr. Grey, who was not so blind as Augustus thought him, saw a great dealof this. Augustus suspected him as well as the squire. His mind wentbackward and forward on these suspicions. It was more probable that thesquire should have contrived all this with the attorney's assistancethan without it. The two, willing it together, might be very powerful.But then Mr. Grey would hardly dare to do it. His father knew that hewas dying; but Mr. Grey had no such easy mode of immediate escape ifdetected. And his father was endowed with a courage as peculiar as itwas great. He did not think that Mr. Grey was so brave a man as hisfather. And then he could trace the payment of no large sum to Mr.Grey,--such as would have been necessary as a bribe in such a case.Augustus suspected Mr. Grey, on and off. But Mr. Grey was sure thatAugustus suspected his own father. Now, of one thing Mr. Grey wascertain:--Augustus was, in truth, the rightful heir. The squire had atfirst contrived to blind him,--him, Mr. Grey,--partly by his ownacuteness, partly through the carelessness of himself and those in hisoffice, partly by the subornation of witnesses who seemed to have beenactually prepared for such an event. But there could be no subsequentblinding. Mr. Grey had a well-earned reputation for professionalacuteness and honesty. He knew there was no need for such suspicions asthose now entertained by the young man; but he knew also that theyexisted, and he hated the young man for entertaining them.When he arrived at Tretton Park he first of all saw Mr. Septimus Jones,with whom he was not acquainted. "Mr. Scarborough will be here directly.He is out somewhere about the stables," said Mr. Jones, in that tone ofvoice with which a guest at the house,--a guest for pleasure,--may addresssometimes a guest who is a guest on business. In such a case the gueston pleasure cannot be a gentleman, and must suppose that the guest onbusiness is not one either.Mr. Grey, thinking that the Mr. Scarborough spoken of could not be thesquire, put Mr. Jones right. "It is the elder Mr. Scarborough whom Iwish to see. There is quite time enough. No doubt Miss Scarborough willbe down presently.""You are Mr. Grey, I believe?""That is my name.""My friend, Augustus Scarborough, is particularly anxious to see youbefore you go to his father. The old man is in very failing health, youknow.""I am well acquainted with the state of Mr. Scarborough's health," saidMr. Grey, "and will leave it to himself to say when I shall see him.Perhaps to-morrow will be best." Then he rung the bell; but the servantentered the room at the same moment and summoned him up to the squire'schamber. Mr. Scarborough also wished to see Mr. Grey before his son, andhad been on the alert to watch for his coming.On the landing he met Miss Scarborough. "He does seem to keep up hisstrength," said the lady. "Mr. Merton is living in the house now, andwatches him very closely." Mr. Merton was a resident young doctor, whomSir William Brodrick had sent down to see that all medical applianceswere at hand as the sick man might require them. Then Mr. Grey was shownin, and found the squire recumbent on a sofa, with a store of bookswithin his reach, and reading apparatuses of all descriptions, and everyappliance which the ingenuity of the skilful can prepare for the reliefof the sick and wealthy."This is very kind of you, Mr. Grey," said the squire, speaking in acheery voice. "I wanted you to come very much, but I hardly thought thatyou would take the trouble. Augustus is here, you know.""So I have heard from that gentleman down-stairs.""Mr. Jones? I have never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jones. What sortof a gentleman is Mr. Jones to look at?""Very much like other gentlemen.""I dare say. He has done me the honor to stay a good deal at my houselately. Augustus never comes without him. He is 'Fidus Achates,' I takeit, to Augustus. Augustus has never asked whether he can be received. Ofcourse it does not matter. When a man is the eldest son, and, so to say,the only one, he is apt to take liberties with his father's house. I amso sorry that in my position I cannot do the honors and receive himproperly. He is a very estimable and modest young man, I believe?" AsMr. Grey had not come down to Tretton either to be a spy on Mr. Jones orto answer questions concerning him, he held his tongue. "Well, Mr. Grey,what do you think about it;--eh?" This was a comprehensive question, butMr. Grey well understood its purport. What did he, Mr. Grey, think ofthe condition to which the affairs of Tretton had been brought, andthose of Mr. Scarborough himself and of his two sons? What did he thinkof Mountjoy, who had disappeared and was still absent? What did he thinkof Augustus, who was not showing his gratitude in the best way for allthat had been done for him? And what did he think of the squire himself,who from his death-bed had so well contrived to have his own way ineverything,--to do all manner of illegal things without paying any of thepenalties to which illegality is generally subject? And having asked thequestion he paused for an answer.Mr. Grey had had no personal interview with the squire since the time atwhich it had been declared that Mountjoy was not the heir. Then somevery severe words had been spoken. Mr. Grey had first sworn that he didnot believe a word of what was said to him, and had refused to deal withthe matter at all. If carried out Mr. Scarborough must take it to someother lawyer's office. There had, since that, been a correspondence asto much of which Mr. Scarborough had been forced to employ anamanuensis. Gradually Mr. Grey had assented, in the first instance onbehalf of Mountjoy, and then on behalf of Augustus. But he had done soin the expectation that he should never again see the squire in thisworld. He, too, had been assured that the man would die, and had feltthat it would be better that the management of things should then be inhonest hands, such as his own, and in the hands of those who understoodthem, than be confided to those who did not not understand them, and whomight probably not be honest.But the squire had not died, and here he was again at Tretton as thesquire's guest. "I think," said Mr. Grey, "that the less said about agood deal of it the better.""That, of course, is sweeping condemnation, which, however, I expect.Let that be all as though it had been expressed. You don't understandthe inner man which rules me,--how it has struggled to free itself fromconventionalities. Nor do I quite understand how your inner man hassuccumbed to them and encouraged them.""I have encouraged an obedience to the laws of my country. Men generallyfind it safer to do so.""Exactly, and men like to be safe. Perhaps a condition of danger hashad its attractions for me. It is very stupid, but perhaps it is so. Butlet that go. The rope has been round my own neck and not round that ofothers. Perhaps I have thought of late that if danger should come Icould run away from it all, by the help of the surgeon. They have becomeso skilful now that a man has no chance in that way. But what do youthink of Mountjoy and Augustus?""I think that Mountjoy has been very ill-used.""But I endeavored to do the best I could for him.""And that Augustus has been worse used.""But he, at any rate, has been put right quite in time. Had he beenbrought up as the eldest son he might have done as Mountjoy did." Thenthere came a little gleam of satisfaction across the squire's face as hefelt the sufficiency of his answer. "But they are neither of thempleased.""You cannot please men by going wrong, even in their own behalf.""I'm not so sure of that. Were you to say that we cannot please men everby doing right on their behalf you would perhaps be nearer the mark.Where do you think that Mountjoy is?" A rumor, had reached Mr. Grey thatMountjoy had been seen at Monte Carlo, but it had been only a rumor. Thesame had, in truth, reached Mr. Scarborough, but he chose to keep hisrumor to himself. Indeed, more than a rumor had reached him."I think that he will turn up safely," said the lawyer. "I think that ifit were made worth his while he would turn up at once.""Is it not better that he should be away?" Mr. Grey shrugged hisshoulders. "What's the good of his coming back into a nest of hornets? Ihave always thought that he did very well to disappear. Where is he tolive if he came back? Should he come here?""Not with his gambling debts unpaid at the club.""That might have been settled. Though, indeed, his gambling was as a tubthat has no bottom to it. There has been nothing for it but to throw himover altogether. And yet how very much the better he has been of thetwo! Poor Mountjoy!""Poor Mountjoy!""You see, if I hadn't disinherited him I should have had to go on payingfor him till the whole estate would have been squandered even during mylifetime.""You speak as though the law had given you the power of disinheritinghim.""So it did.""But not the power of giving him the inheritance.""I took that upon myself. There I was stronger than the law. Now Isimply and humbly ask the law to come and help me. And the upshot isthat Augustus takes upon himself to lecture me and to feel aggrieved. Heis not angry with me for what I did about Mountjoy, but is quarrellingwith me because I do not die. I have no idea of dying just to pleasehim. I think it important that I should live just at present.""But will you let him have the money to pay these creditors?""That is what I want to speak about. If I can see the list of the sumsto be paid, and if you can assure yourself that by paying them I shallget back all the post-obit bonds which Mountjoy has given, and that themoney can be at once raised upon a joint mortgage, to be executed by meand Augustus, I will do it. But the first thing must be to know theamount. I will join Augustus in nothing without your consent. He wantsto assume the power himself. In fact, the one thing he desires is that Ishall go. As long as I remain he shall do nothing except by myco-operation. I will see you and him to-morrow, and now you may go andeat your dinner. I cannot tell you how much obliged I am to you forcoming." And then Mr. Grey left the room, went to his chamber, and inprocess of time made his way into the drawing-room.CHAPTER XX.MR. GREY'S OPINION OF THE SCARBOROUGH FAMILY.Had Augustus been really anxious to see Mr. Grey before Mr. Grey went tohis father, he would probably have managed to do so. He did not alwaystell Mr. Jones everything. "So the fellow has hurried up to the governorthe moment he came into the house," he said."He's with him now.""Of course he is. Never mind. I'll be even with him in the long-run."Then he greeted the lawyer with a mock courtesy as soon as he saw him."I hope your journey has done you no harm, Mr. Grey.""Not in the least.""It's very kind of you, I am sure, to look after our poor concerns withso much interest. Jones, don't you think it is time they gave us somedinner? Mr. Grey, I'm sure, must want his dinner.""All in good time," said the lawyer."You shall have your dinner, Mr. Grey. It is the least we can do foryou." Mr. Grey felt that in every sound of his voice there was aninsult, and took special notice of every tone, and booked them all downin his memory. After dinner he asked some unimportant question withreference to the meeting that was to take place in the morning, and wasat once rebuked. "I do not know that we need trouble our friend herewith our private concerns," he said."Not in the least," said Mr. Grey. "You have already been talking aboutthem in my presence and in his. It is necessary that I should have alist of the creditors before I can advise your father.""I don't see it; but, however, that is for you to judge. Indeed, I donot know on what points my father wants your advice. A lawyer generallyfurnishes such a list." Then Mr. Grey took up a book, and was soon leftalone by the younger men.In the morning he walked out in the park, so as to have free time forthought. Not a word farther had been said between him and Augustustouching their affairs. At breakfast Augustus discussed with his friendthe state of the odds respecting some race and then the characters ofcertain ladies. No subjects could have been less interesting to Mr.Grey, as Augustus was aware. They breakfasted at ten, and twelve hadbeen named for the meeting. Mr. Grey had an hour or an hour and a halffor his walk, in which he could again turn over in his mind all thesematters of which his thoughts had been full for now many a day.Of two or three facts he was certain. Augustus was the legitimate heirof his father. Of that he had seen ample documentary evidence. The wordof no Scarborough should go for anything with him;--but of that fact hewas assured. Whether the squire knew aught of Mountjoy he did not feelsure, but that Augustus did he was quite certain. Who was paying thebills for the scapegrace during his travels he could not say, but hethought it probable that Augustus was finding the money. He, Mountjoy,was kept away, so as to be out of the creditors' way.He thought, therefore, that Augustus was doing this, so that he mightthe more easily buy up the debts. But why should Augustus go to theexpense of buying up the debts, seeing that the money must ultimatelycome out of his own pocket? Because,--so Mr. Grey thought,--Augustus wouldnot trust his own father. The creditors, if they could get hold ofMountjoy when his father was dead, and when the bonds would all becomepayable, might possibly so unravel the facts as to make it apparentthat, after all, the property was Mountjoy's. This was not Mr. Grey'sidea, but was Mr. Grey's idea of the calculation which Augustus wasmaking for his own government. According to Mr. Grey's reading of allthe facts of the case, such were the suspicions which Augustusentertained in the matter. Otherwise, why should he be anxious to take astep which would redound only to the advantage of the creditors? He wasquite certain that no money would be paid, at any rate, by Augustus,solely with the view of honestly settling their claims.But there was another subject which troubled his mind excessively as hewalked across the park. Why should he soil his hands, or, at any rate,trouble his conscience, with an affair so unclean, so perplexed, and sotroublesome? Why was he there at Tretton at all, to be insulted by ayoung blackguard such as he believed Augustus Scarborough to be?Augustus Scarborough, he knew, suspected him. But he, in return,suspected Augustus Scarborough. The creditors suspected him. Mountjoysuspected him. The squire did not suspect him, but he suspected thesquire. He never could again feel himself to be on comfortable terms oftrusting legal friendship with a man who had played such a prank inreference to his marriage as this man had performed. Why, then, shouldhe still be concerned in a matter so distasteful to him? Why should henot wipe his hands of it all and retreat? There was no act of parliamentcompelling him to meddle with the dirt.Such were his thoughts. But yet he knew that he was compelled. He didfeel himself bound to look after interests which he had taken in handnow for many years. It had been his duty,--or the duty of some onebelonging to him,--to see into the deceit by which an attempt had beenmade to rob Augustus Scarborough of his patrimony. It had been his duty,for a while, to protect Mountjoy, and the creditors who had lent theirmoney to Mountjoy, from what he had believed to be a flagitious attempt.Then, as soon as he felt that the flagitious attempt had been madepreviously, in Mountjoy's favor, it became his duty to protect Augustus,in spite of the strong personal dislike which from the first he hadconceived for that young man.And then he doubtless had been attracted by the singularity of all thathad been done in the affair, and of all that was likely to be done. Hehad said to himself that the matter should be made straight, and that hewould make it straight. Therefore, during his walk in the park, heresolved that he must persevere.At twelve o'clock he was ready to be taken up to the sick man's room.When he entered it, under the custody of Miss Scarborough, he found thatAugustus was there. The squire was sitting up, with his feet supported,and was apparently in a good humor. "Well, Mr. Grey," he said, "have yousettled this matter with Augustus?""I have settled nothing.""He has not spoken to me about it at all," said Augustus."I told him I wanted a list of the creditors. He said that it was myduty to supply it. That was the extent of our conversation.""Which he thought it expedient to have in the presence of my friend, Mr.Jones. Mr. Jones is very well in his way, but he is not acquainted withall my affairs.""Your son, Mr. Scarborough, has made no tender to me of anyinformation.""Nor, sir, has Mr. Grey sought for any information from me." During thislittle dialogue Mr. Scarborough turned his face, with a smile, from oneto the other, without a word."If Mr. Grey has anything to suggest in the way of advice, let himsuggest it," said Augustus."Now, Mr. Grey," said the squire, with the same smile."Till I get farther information," said Mr. Grey, "I can only limitmyself to giving the advice which I offered to you yesterday.""Perhaps you will repeat it, so that he may hear it," said the squire."If you get a list of those to whom your son Mountjoy owes money, and anassurance that the moneys named in that list have been from time to timelent by them to him,--the actual amount, I mean,--then I think that if youand your son Augustus shall together choose to pay those amounts, youwill make the best reparation in your power for the injury you have nodoubt done in having contrived that it should be understood thatMountjoy was legitimate.""You need not discuss," said the squire, "any injuries that I have done.I have done a great many, no doubt.""But," continued the lawyer, "before any such payment is made, closeinquiries should be instituted as to the amounts of money which haveabsolutely passed.""We should certainly be taken in," said the squire. "I have greatadmiration for Mr. Samuel Hart. I do believe that it would be foundimpossible to extract the truth from Mr. Samuel Hart. If Mr. Samuel Hartdoes not make money yet out of poor Mountjoy I shall be surprised.""The truth may be ascertained," said Mr. Grey. "You should get someaccountant to examine the checks.""When I remember how easy it was to deceive some really clever men as tothe evidence of my marriage--" began Mr. Scarborough. So the squirebegan, but then stopped himself, with a shrug of his shoulders. Amongthe really clever men who had been easily deceived Mr. Grey was, if notactually first in importance, foremost, at any rate, in name."The truth may be ascertained," Mr. Grey repeated, almost with a scowlof anger upon his brow."Well, yes; I suppose it may. It will be difficult, in opposition to Mr.Samuel Hart.""You must satisfy yourselves, at any rate. These men will know that theyhave no other hope of getting a shilling.""It is a little hard to make them believe anything," said the squire."They fancy, you know, that if they could get a hold of Mountjoy, so asto have him in their hands when the breath is out of my body and thebonds are really due, that then it may be made to turn out that he isreally the heir.""We know that it is not so," said Mr. Grey. At this Augustus smiledblandly."We know. But it is what we can make Mr. Samuel Hart know. In truth, Mr.Samuel Hart never allows himself to know anything,--except the amount ofmoney which he may have at his banker's. And it will be difficult toconvince Mr. Tyrrwhit. Mr. Tyrrwhit is assured that all of us,--you andI, and Mountjoy and Augustus,--are in a conspiracy to cheat him and theothers.""I don't wonder at it," said Mr. Grey."Perhaps not," continued the squire; "the circumstances, no doubt, aresuspicious. But he will have to find out his mistake. Augustus is veryanxious to pay these poor men their money. It is a noble feeling on thepart of Augustus; you must admit that, Mr. Grey." The irony with whichthis was said was evident in the squire's face and voice. Augustus onlyquietly laughed. The attorney sat as firm as death. He was not going toargue with such a statement or to laugh at such a joke. "I suppose itwill come to over a hundred thousand pounds.""Eighty thousand, I should think," said Augustus. "The bonds amount to agreat deal more than that--twice that.""It is for him to judge," said the squire, "whether he is bound by hishonor to pay so large a sum to men whom I do not suppose he loves verywell.""The estate can bear it," said Augustus."Yes, the estate can bear it," said the attorney. "They should be paidwhat they have expended. That is my idea. Your son thinks that theirsilence will be worth the money.""What makes you say that?" demanded Augustus."Just my own opinion.""I look upon it as an insult.""Would you be kind enough to explain to us what is your reason forwishing to do this thing?" asked Mr. Grey."No, sir; I decline to give any reason. But those which you ascribe tome are insulting.""Will you deny them?""I will not assent to anything,--coming from you,--nor will I denyanything. It is altogether out of your place as an attorney to ascribemotives to your clients. Can you raise the money, so that it shall beforthcoming at once? That is the question.""On your father's authority, backed by your signature, I imagine that Ican do so. But I will not answer as a certainty. The best thing would beto sell a portion of the property. If you and your father will join, andMountjoy also with you, it may be done.""What has Mountjoy got to do with it?" asked the father."You had better have Mountjoy also. There may be some doubt as to thetitle. People will think so after the tricks that have been played."This was said by the lawyer; but the squire only laughed. He alwaysshowed some enjoyment of the fun which arose from the effects of his ownscheming. The legal world, with its entails, had endeavored to disposeof his property, but he had shown the legal world that it was not aneasy task to dispose of anything in which he was concerned."How will you get hold of Mountjoy?" asked Augustus. Then the two oldermen only looked at each other. Both of them believed that Augustus knewmore about his brother than any one else. "I think you had better sendto Mr. Annesley and ask him.""What does Annesley know about him?" asked the squire."He was the last person who saw him, at any rate, in London.""Are you sure of that?" said Mr. Grey."I think I may say that I am. I think, at any rate, that I know thatthere was a violent quarrel between them in the streets,--a quarrel inwhich the two men proceeded to blows,--and that Annesley struck him insuch a way as to leave him for dead upon the pavement. Then the youngman walked away, and Mountjoy has not been heard of, or, at least, hasnot been seen since. That a man should have struck such a blow, andthen, on the spur of the moment, thinking of his own safety, should haveleft his opponent, I can understand. I should not like to be accused ofsuch treatment myself, but I can understand it. I cannot understand thatthe man should have been missing altogether, and that then he shouldhave held his tongue.""How do you know all this?" asked the attorney."It is sufficient that I do know it.""I don't believe a word of it," said the squire."Coming from you, of course I must put up with any contradiction," saidAugustus. "I should not bear it from any one else," and he looked at theattorney."One has a right to ask for your authority," said his father."I cannot give it. A lady is concerned whose name I shall not mention.But it is of less importance, as his own friends are acquainted with thenature of his conduct. Indeed, it seems odd to see you two gentlemen soignorant as to the matter which has been a subject of commonconversation in most circles. His uncle means to cut him out from theproperty.""Can he too deal with entails?" said the squire."He is still in middle life, and he can marry. That is what he intendedto do, so much is he disgusted with his nephew. He has already stoppedthe young man's allowance, and swears that he shall not have a shillingof his money if he can help it. The police for some time were in greatdoubt whether they would not arrest him. I think I am justified insaying that he is a thorough reprobate.""You are not at all justified," said the father."I can only express my opinion, and am glad to say that the world agreeswith me.""It is sickening, absolutely sickening," said the squire, turning to theattorney. "You would not believe, now--"But he stopped himself. "What would not Mr. Grey believe?" asked theson."There is no one one knows better than you that after the row in thestreet,--when Mountjoy was, I believe, the aggressor,--he was again seenby another person. I hate such deceit and scheming." Here Augustussmiled. "What are you sniggering there at, you blockhead?""Your hatred, sir, at deceit and scheming. The truth is that when a manplays a game well, he does not like to find that he has any equal.Heaven forbid that I should say that there is rivalry here. You, sir,are so pre-eminently the first that no one can touch you." Then helaughed long,--a low, bitter, inaudible laugh,--during which Mr. Grey satsilent."This comes well from you!" said the father."Well, sir, you would try your hand upon me. I have passed over all thatyou have done on my behalf. But when you come to abuse me I cannot quitetake your words as calmly as though there had been--no, shall I say,antecedents? Now about this money. Are we to pay it?""I don't care one straw about the money. What is it to me? I don't owethese creditors anything.""Nor do I.""Let them rest, then, and do the worst they can. But upon the whole, Mr.Grey," he added, after a pause, "I think we had better pay them. Theyhave endeavored to be insolent to me, and I have therefore ignored theirclaim. I have told them to do their worst. If my son here will agreewith you in raising the money, and if Mountjoy,--as he, too, isnecessary,--will do so, I too will do what is required of me. If eightythousand pounds will settle it all, there ought not to be anydifficulty. You can inquire what the real amount would be. If theychoose to hold to their bonds, nothing will come of it;--that's all.""Very well, Mr. Scarborough. Then I shall know how to proceed. Iunderstand that Mr. Scarborough, junior, is an assenting party?" Mr.Scarborough, junior, signified his assent by nodding his head."That will do, then, for I think that I have a little exhausted myself."Then he turned round upon his couch, as though he intended to slumber.Mr. Grey left the room, and Augustus followed him, but not a word wasspoken between them. Mr. Grey had an early dinner and went up to Londonby an evening train. What became of Augustus he did not inquire, butsimply asked for his dinner and for a conveyance to the train. Thesewere forthcoming, and he returned that night to Fulham."Well?" said Dolly, as soon as she had got him his slippers and madehim his tea."I wish with all my heart I had never seen any one of the name ofScarborough!""That is of course;--but what have you done?""The father has been a great knave. He has set the laws of his countryat defiance, and should be punished most severely. And MountjoyScarborough has proved himself to be unfit to have any money in hishands. A man so reckless is little better than a lunatic. But comparedwith Augustus they are both estimable, amiable men. The father has ideasof philanthropy, and Mountjoy is simply mad. But Augustus is asdishonest as either of them, and is odious also all round." Then atlength he explained all that he had learned, and all that he hadadvised, and at last went to bed combating Dolly's idea that theScarboroughs ought now to be thrown over altogether.CHAPTER XXI.MR. SCARBOROUGH'S THOUGHTS OF HIMSELF.When Mr. Scarborough was left alone he did not go to sleep, as he hadpretended, but lay there for an hour, thinking of his position andindulging to the full the feelings of anger which he now entertainedtoward his second son. He had never, in truth, loved Augustus. Augustuswas very like his father in his capacity for organizing deceit, forplotting, and so contriving that his own will should be in opposition tothe wills of all those around him. But they were thoroughly unlike inthe object to be attained. Mr. Scarborough was not a selfish man.Augustus was selfish and nothing else. Mr. Scarborough hated thelaw,--because it was the law and endeavored to put a restraint upon himand others. Augustus liked the law,--unless when in particular points itinterfered with his own actions. Mr. Scarborough thought that he coulddo better than the law. Augustus wished to do worse. Mr. Scarboroughnever blushed at what he himself attempted, unless he failed, which wasnot often the case. But he was constantly driven to blush for his son.Augustus blushed for nothing and for nobody. When Mr. Scarborough haddeclared to the attorney that just praise was due to Augustus for thenobility of the sacrifice he was making, Augustus had understood hisfather accurately and determined to be revenged, not because of theexpression of his father's thoughts, but because he had so expressedhimself before the attorney. Mr. Scarborough also thought that he wasentitled to his revenge.When he had been left alone for an hour he rung the bell, which wasclose at his side, and called for Mr. Merton. "Where is Mr. Grey?""I think he has ordered the wagonette to take him to the station.""And where is Augustus?""I do not know.""And Mr. Jones? I suppose they have not gone to the station. Just feelmy pulse, Merton. I am afraid I am very weak." Mr. Merton felt his pulseand shook his head. "There isn't a pulse, so to speak.""Oh yes; but it is irregular. If you will exert yourself so violently--""That is all very well; but a man has to exert himself sometimes, letthe penalty be what it may. When do you think that Sir William will haveto come again?" Sir William, when he came, would come with his knife,and his advent was always to be feared."It depends very much on yourself, Mr. Scarborough. I don't think he cancome very often, but you can make the distances long or short. Youshould attend to no business.""That is absolute rubbish.""Nevertheless, it is my duty to say so. Whatever arrangements may berequired, they should be made by others. Of course, if you do as youhave done this morning, I can suggest some little relief. I can give youtonics and increase the amount; but I cannot resist the evil which youyourself do yourself.""I understand all about it.""You will kill yourself if you go on.""I don't mean to go on any farther,--not as I have done to-day; but as togiving up business, that is rubbish. I have got my property to manage,and I mean to manage it myself as long as I live. Unfortunately, therehave been accidents which make the management a little rough at times. Ihave had one of the rough moments to-day, but they shall not berepeated. I give you my word for that. But do not talk to me aboutgiving up my business. Now I'll take your tonics, and then would youhave the kindness to ask my sister to come to me?"Miss Scarborough, who was always in waiting on her brother, was at oncein the room. "Martha," he said, "where is Augustus?""I think he has gone out.""And where is Mr. Septimus Jones?""He is with him, John. The two are always together.""You would not mind giving my compliments to Mr. Jones, and telling himthat his bedroom is wanted?""His bedroom wanted! There are lots of bedrooms, and nobody to occupythem.""It's a hint that I want him to go; he'd understand that.""Would it not be better to tell Augustus?" asked the lady, doubting muchher power to carry out the instructions given to her."He would tell Augustus. It is not, you see, any objection I have to Mr.Jones. I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance. He is a mostagreeable young man, I'm sure; but I do not care to entertain anagreeable young man without having a word to say on the subject.Augustus does not think it worth his while even to speak to me abouthim. Of course, when I am gone, in a month or so,--perhaps a week ortwo,--he can do as he pleases.""Don't, John!""But it is so. While I live I am master at least of this house. I cannotsee Mr. Jones, and I do not wish to have another quarrel with Augustus.Mr. Merton says that every time I get angry it gives Sir William anotherchance with the knife. I thought that perhaps you could do it." ThenMiss Scarborough promised that she would do it, and, having herbrother's health very much at heart, she did do it. Augustus stoodsmiling while the message was, in fact, conveyed to him, but he made noanswer. When the lady had done he bobbed his head to signify that heacknowledged the receipt of it, and the lady retired."I have got my walking-papers," he said to Septimus Jones ten minutesafterward."I don't know what you mean.""Don't you? Then you must be very thick-headed. My father has sent meword that you are to be turned out. Of course he means it for me. Hedoes not wish to give me the power of saying that he sent me away fromthe house,--me, whom he has so long endeavored to rob,--me, to whom heowes so much for taking no steps to punish his fraud. And he knows thatI can take none, because he is on his death-bed.""But you couldn't, could you, if he were--were anywhere else?""Couldn't I? That's all you know about it. Understand, however, that Ishall start to-morrow morning, and unless you like to remain here on avisit to him, you had better go with me." Mr. Jones signified hiscompliance with the hint, and so Miss Scarborough had done her work.Mr. Scarborough, when thus left alone, spent his time chiefly inthinking of the condition of his sons. His eldest son, Mountjoy, who hadever been his favorite, whom as a little boy he had spoiled by everymeans in his power, was a ruined man. His debts had all been paid,except the money due to the money-lenders. But he was not the less aruined man. Where he was at this moment his father did not know. All theworld knew the injustice of which he had been guilty on his boy'sbehalf, and all the world knew the failure of the endeavor. And now hehad made a great and a successful effort to give back to his legitimateheir all the property. But in return the second son only desired hisdeath, and almost told him so to his face. He had been proud of Augustusas a lad, but he had never loved him as he had loved Mountjoy. Now heknew that he and Augustus must henceforward be enemies. Never for amoment did he think of giving up his power over the estate as long asthe estate should still be his. Though it should be but for a month,though it should be but for a week, he would hold his own. Such was thenature of the man, and when he swallowed Mr. Merton's tonics he did somore with the idea of keeping the property out of his son's hands thanof preserving his own life. According to his view, he had done very muchfor Augustus, and this was the return which he received!And in truth he had done much for Augustus. For years past it had beenhis object to leave to his second son as much as would come to hisfirst. He had continued to put money by for him, instead of spending hisincome on himself.Of this Mr. Grey had known much, but had said nothing when he wasspeaking those severe words which Mr. Scarborough had always contrivedto receive with laughter. But he had felt their injustice, though he hadhimself ridiculed the idea of law. There had been the two sons, bothborn from the same mother, and he had willed that they should be bothrich men, living among the foremost of their fellowmen, and thecircumstances of the property would have helped him. The income fromyear to year went on increasing.The water-mills of Tretton and the town of Tretton had grown and beenexpanded within his domain, and the management of the sales in Mr.Grey's hands had been judicious. The revenues were double now what theyhad been when Mr. Scarborough first inherited it. It was all, no doubt,entailed, but for twenty years he had enjoyed the power of accumulatinga sum of money for his second son's sake,--or would have enjoyed it, hadnot the accumulation been taken from him to pay Mountjoy's debts. It wasin vain that he attempted to make Mountjoy responsible for the money.Mountjoy's debts, and irregularities, and gambling went on, till Mr.Scarborough found himself bound to dethrone the illegitimate son, and toplace the legitimate in his proper position.In doing the deed he had not suffered much, though the circumstanceswhich had led to the doing of it had been full of pain. There had beenan actual pleasure to him in thus showing himself to be superior to theconventionalities of the world. There was Augustus still ready to occupythe position to which he had in truth been born. And at the momentMountjoy had gone--he knew not where. There had been gambling debtswhich, coming as they did after many others, he had refused to pay. Hehimself was dying at the moment, as he thought. It would be better forhim to take up with Augustus. Mountjoy he must leave to his fate. Forsuch a son, so reckless, so incurable, so hopeless, it was impossiblethat anything farther should be done. He would at least enjoy the powerof leaving those wretched creditors without their money. There would besome triumph, some consolation, in that. So he had done, and now hisheir turned against him!It was very bitter to him, as he lay thinking of it all. He was a manwho was from his constitution and heart capable of making greatsacrifices for those he loved. He had a most thorough contempt for thecharacter of an honest man. He did not believe in honesty, but only inmock honesty. And yet he would speak of an honest man with admiration,meaning something altogether different from the honesty of which menordinarily spoke. The usual honesty of the world was with him allpretence, or, if not, assumed for the sake of the character it wouldachieve. Mr. Grey he knew to be honest; Mr. Grey's word he knew to betrue; but he fancied that Mr. Grey had adopted this absurd mode ofliving with the view of cheating his neighbors by appearing to be betterthan others. All virtue and all vice were comprised by him in the words"good-nature" and "ill-nature." All church-going propensities,--andthese propensities in his estimate extended very widely,--he scorned fromthe very bottom of his heart. That one set of words should be deemedmore wicked than another, as in regard to swearing, was to him a signeither of hypocrisy, of idolatry, or of feminine weakness of intellect.To women he allowed the privilege of being, in regard to thought, onlysomething better than dogs. When his sister Martha shuddered at someexclamation from his mouth, he would say to himself simply that she wasa woman, not an idiot or a hypocrite. Of women, old and young, he hadbeen very fond, and in his manner to them very tender; but when a womanrose to a way of thinking akin to his own, she was no longer a woman tohis senses. Against such a one his taste revolted. She sunk to the levelof a man contaminated by petticoats. And law was hardly less absurd tohim than religion. It consisted of a perplexed entanglement of rules gottogether so that the few might live in comfort at the expense of themany.Robbery, if you could get to the bottom of it, was bad, as was allviolence; but taxation was robbery, rent was robbery, prices fixedaccording to the desire of the seller and not in obedience to justice,were robbery. "Then you are the greatest of robbers," his friends wouldsay to him. He would admit it, allowing that in such a state of societyhe was not prepared to go out and live naked in the streets if he couldhelp it. But he delighted to get the better of the law, and triumphed inhis own iniquity, as has been seen by his conduct in reference to hissons.In this way he lived, and was kind to many people, having a generous andan open hand. But he was a man who could hate with a bitter hatred, andhe hated most those suspected by him of mean or dirty conduct. Mr. Grey,who constantly told him to his face that he was a rascal, he did nothate at all. Thinking Mr. Grey to be in some respects idiotic, herespected him, and almost loved him. He thoroughly believed Mr. Grey,thinking him to be an ass for telling so much truth unnecessarily. Andhe had loved his son Mountjoy in spite of all his iniquities, and hadfostered him till it was impossible to foster him any longer. Then hehad endeavored to love Augustus, and did not in the least love him theless because his son told him frequently of the wicked things he haddone. He did not object to be told of his wickedness even by his son.But Augustus suspected him of other things than those of which heaccused him, and attempted to be sharp with him and to get the betterof him at his own game. And his son laughed at him and scorned him, andregarded him as one who was troublesome only for a time, and who neednot be treated with much attention, because he was there only for atime. Therefore he hated Augustus. But Augustus was his heir, and heknew that he must die soon.But for how long could he live? And what could he yet do before he died?A braver man than Mr. Scarborough never lived,--that is, one who lessfeared to die. Whether that is true courage may be a question, but itwas his, in conjunction with courage of another description. He did notfear to die, nor did he fear to live. But what he did fear was to failbefore he died. Not to go out with the conviction that he was vanishingamid the glory of success, was to him to be wretched at his last moment,and to be wretched at his last moment, or to anticipate that he shouldbe so, was to him,--even so near his last hours,--the acme of misery. Howmuch of life was left to him, so that he might recover something ofsuccess? Or was any moment left to him?He could not sleep, so he rung his bell, and again sent for Mr. Merton."I have taken what you told me.""So best," said Mr. Merton. For he did not always feel assured that thisstrange patient would take what had been ordered."And I have tried to sleep.""That will come after a while. You would not naturally sleep just afterthe tonic.""And I have been thinking of what you said about business. There is onething I must do, and then I can remain quiet for a fortnight, unless Ishould be called upon to disturb my rest by dying.""We will hope not.""That may go as it pleases," said the sick man. "I want you now to writea letter for me to Mr. Grey." Mr. Merton had undertaken to perform theduties of secretary as well as doctor, and had thought in this way toobtain some authority over his patient for the patient's own good; buthe had found already that no authority had come to him. He now sat downat the table close to the bedside, and prepared to write in accordancewith Mr. Scarborough's dictation. "I think that Grey,--the lawyer, youknow,--is a good man.""The world, as far as I hear it, says that he is honest.""I don't care a straw what the world says. The world says that I amdishonest, but I am not." Merton could only shrug his shoulders. "Idon't say that because I want you to change your opinion. I don't carewhat you think. But I tell you a fact. I doubt whether Grey is soabsolutely honest as I am, but, as things go, he is a good man.""Certainly.""But the world, I suppose, says that my son Augustus is honest?""Well, yes; I should suppose so.""If you have looked into him and have seen the contrary, I respect yourintelligence.""I did not mean anything particular.""I dare say not, and if so, I mean nothing particular as to yourintelligence. He, at any rate, is a scoundrel. Mountjoy--you knowMountjoy?""Never saw him in my life.""I don't think he is a scoundrel,--not all round. He has gambled when hehas not had money to pay. That is bad. And he has promised when hewanted money, and broken his word as soon as he had got it, which is badalso. And he has thought himself to be a fine fellow because he has beenintimate with lords and dukes, which is very bad. He has never caredwhether he paid his tailor. I do not mean that he has merely got intodebt, which a young man such as he cannot help; but he has not caredwhether his breeches were his or another man's. That too is bad. Thoughhe has been passionately fond of women, it has only been for himself,not for the women, which is very bad. There is an immense deal to bealtered before he can go to heaven.""I hope the change may come before it is too late," said Merton."These changes don't come very suddenly, you know. But there is somechance for Mountjoy. I don't think that there is any for Augustus." Herehe paused, but Merton did not feel disposed to make any remark. "Youdon't happen to know a young man of the name of Annesley,--HarryAnnesley?""I have heard his name from your son.""From Augustus? Then you didn't hear any good of him, I'm sure. You haveheard all the row about poor Mountjoy's disappearance?""I heard that he did disappear.""After a quarrel with that Annesley?""After some quarrel. I did not notice the name at the time.""Harry Annesley was the name. Now, Augustus says that Harry Annesleywas the last person who saw Mountjoy before his disappearance,--the lastwho knew him. He implies thereby that Annesley was the conscious orunconscious cause of his disappearance.""Well, yes.""Certainly it is so. And as it has been thought by the police, and byother fools, that Mountjoy was murdered,--that his disappearance wasoccasioned by his death, either by murder or suicide, it follows thatAnnesley must have had something to do with it. That is the inference,is it not?""I should suppose so," said Merton."That is manifestly the inference which Augustus draws. To hear himspeak to me about it you would suppose that he suspected Annesley ofhaving killed Mountjoy.""Not that, I hope.""Something of the sort. He has intended it to be believed that Annesley,for his own purposes, has caused Mountjoy to be made away with. He hasendeavored to fill the police with that idea. A policeman, generally, isthe biggest fool that London, or England, or the world produces, and hasbeen selected on that account. Therefore the police have a beautifullymysterious but altogether ignorant suspicion as to Annesley. That is thedoing of Augustus, for some purpose of his own. Now, let me tell youthat Augustus saw Mountjoy after Annesley had seen him, that he knowsthis to be the case, and that it was Augustus, who contrived Mountjoy'sdisappearance. Now what do you think of Augustus?" This was a questionwhich Merton did not find it very easy to answer. But Mr. Scarboroughwaited for a reply. "Eh?" he exclaimed."I had rather not give an opinion on a point so raised.""You may. Of course you understand that I intend to assert that Augustusis the greatest blackguard you ever knew. If you have anything to say inhis favor you can say it.""Only that you may be mistaken. Living down here, you may not know thetruth.""Just that. But I do know the truth. Augustus is very clever; but thereare others as clever as he is. He can pay, but then so can I. That heshould want to get Mountjoy out of the way is intelligible. Mountjoy hasbecome disreputable, and had better be out of the way. But whypersistently endeavor to throw the blame upon young Annesley? Thatsurprises me;--only I do not care much about it. I hear now for the firsttime that he has ruined young Annesley, and that does appear to be veryhorrible. But why does he want to pay eighty thousand pounds to thesecreditors? That I should wish to do so,--out of a property which must ina very short time become his,--would be intelligible. I may be supposedto have some affection for Mountjoy, and, after all, am not called uponto pay the money out of my own pocket. Do you understand it?""Not in the least," said Merton, who did not, indeed, very much careabout it."Nor do I;--only this, that if he could pay these men and deprive them ofall power of obtaining farther payment, let who would have the property,they at any rate would be quiet. Augustus is now my eldest son. Perhapshe thinks he might not remain so. If I were out of the way, and thesecreditors were paid, he thinks that poor Mountjoy wouldn't have achance. He shall pay this eighty thousand pounds. Mountjoy hasn't achance as it is; but Augustus shall pay the penalty."Then he threw himself back on the bed, and Mr. Merton begged him tospare himself the trouble of the letter for the present. But in a fewminutes he was again on his elbow and took some farther medicine. "I'm agreat ass," he said, "to help Augustus in playing his game. If I were togo off at once he would be the happiest fellow left alive. But come, letus begin." Then he dictated the letter as follows:"DEAR MR. GREY,--I have been thinking much of what passed between us theother day. Augustus seems to be in a great hurry as to paying thecreditors, and I do not see why he should not be gratified, as the moneymay now be forthcoming. I presume that the sales, which will becompleted before Christmas, will nearly enable us to stop their mouths.I can understand that Mountjoy should be induced to join with me andAugustus, so that in disposing of so large a sum of money the authorityof all may be given, both of myself and of the heir, and also of him whoa short time since was supposed to be the heir. I think that you maypossibly find Mountjoy's address by applying to Augustus, who is alwaysclever in such matters."But you will have to be certain that you obtain all the bonds. If youcan get Tyrrwhit to help you you will be able to be sure of doing so.The matter to him is one of vital importance, as his sum is so much thelargest. Of course he will open his mouth very wide; but when he findsthat he can get his principal and nothing more, I think that he willhelp you. I am afraid that I must ask you to put yourself incorrespondence with Augustus. That he is an insolent scoundrel I willadmit; but we cannot very well complete this affair without him. I fancythat he now feels it to be his interest to get it all done before I die,as the men will be clamorous with their bonds as soon as the breath isout of my body.--"Yours sincerely, JOHN SCARBOROUGH.""That will do," he said, when the letter was finished. But when Mr.Merton turned to leave the room Mr. Scarborough detained him. "Upon thewhole, I am not dissatisfied with my life," he said."I don't know that you have occasion," rejoined Mr. Merton. In this heabsolutely lied, for, according to his thinking, there was very much inthe affairs of Mr. Scarborough's life which ought to have inducedregret. He knew the whole story of the birth of the elder son, of thesubsequent marriage, of Mr. Scarborough's fraudulent deceit which hadlasted so many years, and of his later return to the truth, so as tosave the property, and to give back to the younger son all of which forso many years he, his father, had attempted to rob him.All London had talked of the affair, and all London had declared that sowicked and dishonest an old gentleman had never lived. And now he hadreturned to the truth simply with the view of cheating the creditors andkeeping the estate in the family. He was manifestly an old gentleman whoought to be, above all others, dissatisfied with his own life; but Mr.Merton, when the assertion was made to him, knew not what other answerto make."I really do not think I have, nor do I know one to whom heaven with allits bliss will be more readily accorded. What have I done for myself?""I don't quite know what you have done all your life.""I was born a rich man, and then I married,--not rich as I am now, butwith ample means for marrying.""After Mr. Mountjoy's birth," said Merton, who could not pretend to beignorant of the circumstance."Well, yes. I have my own ideas about marriage and that kind of thing,which are, perhaps, at variance with yours." Whereupon Merton bowed. "Ihad the best wife in the world, who entirely coincided with me in allthat I did. I lived entirely abroad, and made most liberal allowances toall the agricultural tenants. I rebuilt all the cottages;--go and look atthem. I let any man shoot his own game till Mountjoy came up in theworld and took the shooting into his own hands. When the people at thepottery began to build I assisted them in every way in the world. Ioffered to keep a school at my own expense, solely on the understandingthat what they call Dissenters should be allowed to come there. Theparson spread abroad a rumor that I was an atheist, and consequently theSchool was kept for the Dissenters only. The School-board has come andmade that all right, though the parson goes on with his rumor. If heunderstood me as well as I understand him, he would know that he is moreof an atheist than I am. I gave my boys the best education, spending onthem more than double what is done by men with twice my means. My tasteswere all simple, and were not specially vicious. I do not know that Ihave ever made any one unhappy. Then the estate became richer, butMountjoy grew more and more expensive. I began to find that with all myeconomies the estate could not keep pace with him, so as to allow me toput by anything for Augustus. Then I had to bethink myself what I had todo to save the estate from those rascals.""You took peculiar steps.""I am a man who does take peculiar steps. Another would have turned hisface to the wall in my state of health, and have allowed two dirty Jewssuch as Tyrrwhit and Samuel Hart to have revelled in the wealth ofTretton. I am not going to allow them to revel. Tyrrwhit knows me, andHart will have to know me. They could not keep their hands to themselvestill the breath was out of my body. Now I am about to see that eachshall have his own shortly, and the estate will still be kept in thefamily.""For Mr. Augustus Scarborough?""Yes, alas, yes! But that is not my doing. I do not know that I havecause to be dissatisfied with myself, but I cannot but own that I amunhappy. But I wished you to understand that though a man may break thelaw, he need not therefore be accounted bad, and though he may haveviews of his own as to religious matters, he need not be an atheist. Ihave made efforts on behalf of others, in which I have allowed nooutward circumstances to control me. Now I think I do feel sleepy."CHAPTER XXII.HARRY ANNESLEY IS SUMMONED HOME."Just now I am triumphant," Harry Annesley had said to his hostess as heleft Mrs. Armitage's house in the Paragon, at Cheltenham. He wasabsolutely triumphant, throwing his hat up into the air in theabandonment of his joy. For he was not a man to have conceived so wellof his own parts as to have flattered himself that the girl mustcertainly be his.There are at present a number of young men about who think that fewgirls are worth the winning, but that any girl is to be had, not byasking,--which would be troublesome,--but simply by looking at her. Youcan see the feeling in their faces. They are for the most part small instature, well made little men, who are aware that they have something tobe proud of, wearing close-packed, shining little hats, by which theyseem to add more than a cubit to their stature; men endowed with certaingifts of personal--dignity I may perhaps call it, though the word risessomewhat too high. They look as though they would be able to say aclever thing; but their spoken thoughts seldom rise above a small, acridsharpness. They respect no one; above all, not their elders. To such aone his horse comes first, if he have a horse; then a dog; and then astick; and after that the mistress of his affections. But their fault isnot altogether of their own making. It is the girls themselves who spoilthem and endure their inanity, because of that assumed look ofsuperiority which to the eyes of the outside world would be a littleoffensive were it not a little foolish. But they do not marry often.Whether it be that the girls know better at last, or that theythemselves do not see sufficiently clearly their future dinners, who cansay? They are for the most part younger brothers, and perhaps havediscovered the best way of getting out of the world whatever scraps theworld can afford them. Harry Annesley's faults were altogether ofanother kind. In regard to this young woman, the Florence whom he hadloved, he had been over-modest. Now his feeling of glory was altogetherredundant. Having been told by Florence that she was devoted to him, hewalked with his head among the heavens. The first instinct with such ayoung man as those of whom I have spoken teaches him, the moment he hascommitted himself, to begin to consider how he can get out of thescrape. It is not much of a scrape, for when an older man comes thisway, a man verging toward baldness, with a good professional income, ourlittle friend is forgotten and he is passed by without a word. But Harryhad now a conviction,--on that one special night,--that he never would beforgotten and never would forget. He was filled at once with an unwontedpride. All the world was now at his feet, and all the stars were open tohim. He had begun to have a glimmering of what it was that AugustusScarborough intended to do; but the intentions of Augustus Scarboroughwere now of no moment to him. He was clothed in a panoply of armor whichwould be true against all weapons. At any rate, on that night and duringthe next day this feeling remained the same with him.Then he received a summons from his mother at Buston. His mother pressedhim to come at once down to the parsonage. "Your uncle has been withyour father, and has said terrible things about you. As you know, mybrother is not very strong-minded, and I should not care so much forwhat he says were it not that so much is in his hands. I cannotunderstand what it is all about, but your father says that he doesnothing but threaten. He talks of putting the entail on one side.Entails used to be fixed things, I thought; but since what old Mr.Scarborough did nobody seems to regard them now. But even suppose theentail does remain, what are you to do about the income? Your fatherthinks you had better come down and have a little talk about thematter."This was the first blow received since the moment of his exaltation.Harry knew very well that the entail was fixed, and could not be putaside by Mr. Prosper, though Mr. Scarborough might have succeeded withhis entail; but yet he was aware that his present income was chieflydependent on his uncle's good-will. To be reduced to live on hisfellowship would be very dreadful. And that income, such as it was,depended entirely on his celibacy. And he had, too, as he was wellaware, engendered habits of idleness during the last two years. The mindof a young man so circumstanced turns always first to the Bar, and thento literature. At the Bar he did not think that there could be anyopening for him. In the first place, it was late to begin; and then hewas humble enough to believe of himself that he had none of the peculiargifts necessary for a judge or for an advocate. Perhaps the knowledgethat six or seven years of preliminary labor would be necessary wassomewhat of a deterrent.The rewards of literature might be achieved immediately. Such was hisidea. But he had another idea,--perhaps as erroneous,--that this careerwould not become a gentleman who intended to be Squire of Buston. He hadseen two or three men, decidedly Bohemian in their modes of life, towhom he did not wish to assimilate himself. There was Quaverdale, whomhe had known intimately at St. John's, and who was on the Press.Quaverdale had quarrelled absolutely with his father, who was also aclergyman, and having been thrown altogether on his own resources, hadcome out as a writer for _The Coming Hour_. He made his five or sixhundred a year in a rattling, loose, uncertain sort of fashion, andwas,--so thought Harry Annesley,--the dirtiest man of his acquaintance. Hedid not believe in the six hundred a year, or Quaverdale would certainlyhave changed his shirt more frequently, and would sometimes have had anew pair of trousers. He was very amusing, very happy, very thoughtless,and as a rule altogether impecunious. Annesley had never known himwithout the means of getting a good dinner, but those means did not riseto the purchase of a new hat. Putting Quaverdale before him as anexample, Annesley could not bring himself to choose literature as aprofession. Thinking of all this when he received his mother's letter,he assured himself that Florence would not like professional literature.He wrote to say that he would be down at Buston in five days' time. Itdoes not become a son who is a fellow of a college and the heir to aproperty to obey his parents too quickly. But he gave up theintermediate days to thinking over the condition which bound him to hisuncle, and to discussing his prospects with Quaverdale, who, as usual,was remaining in town doing the editor's work for _The Coming Hour_. "Ifhe interfered with me I should tell him to go to bed," said Quaverdale.The allusion was, of course, made to Mr. Prosper."I am not on those sort of terms with him.""I should make my own terms, and then let him do his worst. What can hedo? If he means to withdraw his beggarly two hundred and fifty pounds,of course he'll do it.""I suppose I do owe him something, in the way of respect.""Not if he threatens you in regard to money. What does it come to? Thatyou are to cringe at his heels for a beggarly allowance which he hasbeen pleased to bestow upon you without your asking. 'Very well, my dearfellow,' I should say to him, 'you can stop it the moment you please.For certain objects of your own,--that your heir might live in the worldafter a certain fashion,--you have bestowed it. It has been mine since Iwas a child. If you can reconcile it to your conscience to discontinueit, do so.' You would find that he would have to think twice about it.""He will stop it, and what am I to do then? Can I get an opening on anyof these papers?" Quaverdale whistled,--a mode of receiving the overturewhich was not pleasing to Annesley. "I don't suppose that anything sovery super-human in the way of intellect is required." Annesley had gota fellowship, whereas Quaverdale had done nothing at the university."Couldn't you make a pair of shoes? Shoemakers do get good wages.""What do you mean? A fellow never can get you to be serious for twominutes together."I never was more serious in my life.""That I am to make shoes?""No, I don't quite think that. I don't suppose you can make them. You'dhave first to learn the trade and show that you were an adept.""And I must show that I am an adept before I can write for _The ComingHour_." There was a tone of sarcasm in this which was not lost onQuaverdale."Certainly you must; and that you are a better adept than I who have gotthe place, or some other unfortunate who will have to be put out of hisberth. _The Coming Hour_ only requires a certain number. Of course thereare many newspapers in London, and many magazines, and much literarywork going. You may get your share of it, but you have got to begin byshoving some incompetent fellow out. And in order to be able to beginyou must learn the trade.""How did you begin?""Just in that way. While you were roaming about London like a finegentleman I began by earning twenty-four shillings a week.""Can I earn twenty-four shillings a week?""You won't because you have already got your fellowship. You had a knackat writing Greek iambics, and therefore got a fellowship. I picked up atthe same time the way of stringing English together. I also soon learnedthe way to be hungry. I'm not hungry now very often, but I've beenthrough it. My belief is that you wouldn't get along with my editor.""That's your idea of being independent.""Certainly it is. I do his work, and take his pay, and obey his orders.If you think you can do the same, come and try. There's not room here,but there is, no doubt, room elsewhere. There's the trade to belearned, like any other trade; but my belief is that even then you couldnot do it. We don't want Greek iambics."Harry turned away disgusted. Quaverdale was like the rest of the world,and thought that a peculiar talent and a peculiar tact were needed forhis own business. Harry believed that he was as able to write a leadingarticle, at any rate, as Quaverdale, and that the Greek iambics wouldnot stand in his way. But he conceived it to be probable that his habitsof cleanliness might do so, and gave up the idea for the present. Hethought that his friend should have welcomed him with an open hand intothe realms of literature; and, perhaps, it was the case that Quaverdaleattributed too much weight to the knack of turning readable paragraphson any subject at any moment's notice.But what should he do down at Buston? There were three persons therewith whom he would have to contend,--his father, his mother, and hisuncle. With his father he had always been on good terms, but had stillbeen subject to a certain amount of gentle sarcasm. He had got hisfellowship and his allowance, and so had been lifted above his father'sauthority. His father thoroughly despised his brother-in-law, and lookeddown upon him as an absolute ass. But he was reticent, only dropping aword here and there, out of deference, perhaps, to his wife, and from afeeling lest his son might be deficient in wise courtesy, if he wereencouraged to laugh at his benefactor. He had said a word or two as to aprofession when Harry left Cambridge, but the word or two had come tonothing. In those days the uncle had altogether ridiculed the idea, andthe mother, fond of her son, the fellow and the heir, had altogetheropposed the notion. The rector himself was an idle, good-looking,self-indulgent man,--a man who read a little and understood what he read,and thought a little and understood what he thought, but who took notrouble about anything. To go through the world comfortably with arather large family and a rather small income was the extent of hisambition. In regard to his eldest son he had begun well. Harry had beeneducated free, and had got a fellowship. He had never cost his father ashilling. And now the eldest of two grown-up daughters was engaged to bemarried to the son of a brewer living in the little town of Buntingford.This also was a piece of good-luck which the rector accepted with athankful heart. There was another grown-up girl, also pretty, and then athird girl not grown up and the two boys who were at present at schoolat Royston. Thus burdened, the Rev. Mr. Annesley went through the worldwith as jaunty a step as was possible, making but little of histroubles, but anxious to make as much as he could of his advantages. Ofthese, the position of Harry was the brightest, if only Harry would becareful to guard it. It was quite out of the question that he shouldfind an income for Harry if the squire stopped the two hundred and fiftypounds per annum which he at present allowed him.Then there was Harry's mother, who had already very frequentlydiscounted the good things which were to fall to Harry's lot. She was adear, good, motherly woman, all whose geese were certainly counted to beswans. And of all swans Harry was the whitest; whereas, in purity ofplumage, Mary, the eldest daughter, who had won the affections of theyoung Buntingford brewer, was the next. That Harry's allowance should bestopped would be almost as great a misfortune as though Mr. Thoroughbungwere to break his neck out hunting with the Puckeridge hounds,--anamusement which, after the manner of brewers, he was much in the habitof following. Mrs. Annesley had lived at Buston all her life, havingbeen born at the Hall. She was an excellent mother of a family, and agood clergyman's wife, being in both respects more painstaking andassiduous than her husband. But she did maintain something of respectfor her brother, though in her inmost heart she knew that he was a fool.But to have been born Squire of Buston was something, and to havereached the age of fifty unmarried, so as to leave the position of heiropen to her own son, was more. To such a one a great deal was due; butof that deal Harry was but little disposed to pay any part. He must betalked to, and very seriously talked to, and if possible saved from thesin of offending his easily-offended uncle. A terrible idea had beensuggested to her lately by her husband. The entail might be madealtogether inoperative by the marriage of her brother. It was a fearfulnotion, but one which if it entered into her brother's head mightpossibly be carried out. No one before had ever dreamed of anything sodangerous to the Annesley interests, and Mrs. Annesley now felt that bydue submission on the part of the heir it might be avoided.But the squire himself was the foe whom Harry most feared. He quiteunderstood that he would be required to be submissive, and, even if hewere willing, he did not know how to act the part. There was much nowthat he would endure for the sake of Florence. If Mr. Prosper demandedthat after dinner he should hear a sermon, he would sit and hear it out.It would be a bore, but might be endured on behalf of the girl whom heloved. But he much feared that the cause of his uncle's displeasure wasdeeper than that. A rumor had reached him that his uncle had declaredhis conduct to Mountjoy Scarborough to have been abominable. He hadheard no words spoken by his uncle, but threats had reached him throughhis mother, and also through his uncle's man of business. He certainlywould go down to Buston, and carry himself toward his uncle with whatoutward signs of respect would be possible. But if his uncle accusedhim, he could not but tell his uncle that he knew nothing of the matterof which he was talking. Not for all Buston could he admit that he haddone anything mean or ignoble. Florence, he was quite sure, would notdesire it. Florence would not be Florence were she to desire it. Hethought that he could trace the hands,--or rather the tongues,--throughwhich the calumny had made its way down to the Hall. He would at once goto the Hall, and tell his uncle all the facts. He would describe thegross ill-usage to which he had been subjected. No doubt he had left theman sprawling upon the pavement, but there had been no sign that the manhad been dangerously hurt; and when two days afterward the man hadvanished, it was clear that he could not have vanished without legs. Hadhe taken himself off,--as was probable,--then why need Harry troublehimself as to his vanishing? If some one else had helped him inescaping,--as was also probable,--why had not that some one come and toldthe circumstances when all the inquiries were being made? Why should hehave been expected to speak of the circumstances of such an encounter,which could not have been told but to Captain Scarborough's infinitedisgrace? And he could not have told of it without naming FlorenceMountjoy.His uncle, when he heard the truth, must acknowledge that he had notbehaved badly. And yet Harry, as he turned it all in his mind was uneasyas to his own conduct. He could not quite acquit himself in that he hadkept secret all the facts of that midnight encounter in the face of theinquiries which had been made, in that he had falsely assured AugustusScarborough of his ignorance. And yet he knew that on no considerationwould he acknowledge himself to have been wrong.CHAPTER XXIII.THE RUMORS AS TO MR. PROSPER.It was still October when Harry Annesley went down to Buston, and theMountjoys had just reached Brussels. Mr. Grey had made his visit toTretton and had returned to London. Harry went home on anunderstanding,--on the part of his mother, at any rate,--that he shouldremain there till Christmas. But he felt himself very averse to so longa sojourn. If the Hall and park were open to him he might endure it. Hewould take down two or three stiff books which he certainly would neverread, and would shoot a few pheasants, and possibly ride one of hisfuture brother-in-law's horses with the hounds. But he feared that therewas to be a quarrel by which he would be debarred from the Hall and thepark; and he knew, too, that it would not be well for him to shoot andhunt when his income should have been cut off. It would be necessarythat some great step should be taken at once; but then it would benecessary, also, that Florence should agree to that step. He had amodest lodging in London, but before he started he prepared himself forwhat must occur by giving notice. "I don't say as yet that I shall givethem up; but I might as well let you know that it's possible." This hesaid to Mrs. Brown, who kept the lodgings, and who received thisintimation as a Mrs. Brown is sure to do. But where should he betakehimself when his home at Mrs. Brown's had been lost? He would, hethought, find it quite impossible to live in absolute idleness at therectory. Then in an unhappy frame of mind he went down by the train toStevenage, and was there met by the rectory pony-carriage.He saw it all in his mother's eye the moment she embraced him. There wassome terrible trouble in the wind, and what could it be but his uncle?"Well, mother, what is it?""Oh, Harry, there is such a sad affair up at the Hall!""Is my uncle dead?""Dead! No!""Then why do you look so sad?--  "'Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,  So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,  Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night.'""Oh Harry do not laugh. Your uncle says such dreadful things!""I don't care much what he says. The question is--what does he mean todo?""He declares that he will cut you off altogether.""That is sooner said than done.""That is all very well, Harry; but he can do it. Oh, Harry! But come andsit down and talk to me. I told your father to be out, so that I mighthave you alone; and the dear girls are gone into Buntingford.""Ah, like them! Thoroughbung will have enough of them.""He is our only happiness now.""Poor Thoroughbung! I pity him if he has to do happiness for the wholehousehold.""Joshua is a most excellent young man. Where we should be without him Ido not know." The flourishing young brewer was named Joshua, and hadbeen known to Harry for some years, though never as yet known as abrother-in-law."I am sure he is; particularly as he has chosen Molly to be his wife. Heis just the young man who ought to have a wife.""Of course he ought.""Because he can keep a family. But now about my uncle. He is to performthis ceremony of cutting me off. Will he turn out to have had a wife andfamily in former ages? I have no doubt old Scarborough could manage it,but I don't give my uncle credit for so much cleverness.""But in future ages--" said the unhappy mother, shaking her head andrubbing her eyes."You mean that he is going to have a family?""It is all in the hands of Providence," said the parson's wife."Yes; that is true. He is not too old yet to be a second Priam, and havehis curtains drawn the other way. That's his little game, is it?""There's a sort of rumor about, that it is possible.""And who is the lady?""You may be sure there will be no lack of a lady if he sets his mindupon it. I was turning it over in my mind, and I thought of MatildaThoroughbung.""Joshua's aunt!""Well; she is Joshua's aunt, no doubt. I did just whisper the idea toJoshua, and he says that she is fool enough for anything. She hastwenty-five thousand pounds of her own, but she lives all by herself.""I know where she lives,--just out of Buntingford, as you go to Royston.But she's not alone. Is Uncle Prosper to marry Miss Tickle also?" MissTickle was an estimable lady living as companion to Miss Thoroughbung."I don't know how they may manage; but it has to be thought of, Harry.We only know that your uncle has been twice to Buntingford.""The lady is fifty, at any rate.""The lady is barely forty. She gives out that she is thirty-six. And hecould settle a jointure on her which would leave the property not worthhaving.""What can I do?""Yes, indeed, my dear; what can you do?""Why is he going to upset all the arrangements of my life, and his life,after such a fashion as this?""That's just what your father says.""I suppose he can do it. The law will allow him. But the injustice wouldbe monstrous. I did not ask him to take me by the hand when I was a boyand lead me into this special walk of life. It has been his own doing.How will he look me in the face and tell me that he is going to marry awife? I shall look him in the face and tell him of my wife.""But is that settled?""Yes, mother; it is settled. Wish me joy for having won the finest ladythat ever walked the earth." His mother blessed him,--but said nothingabout the finest lady,--who at that moment she believed to be the futurebride of Mr. Joshua Thoroughbung. "And when I shall tell my uncle thatit is so, what will he say to me? Will he have the face then to tell methat I am to be cut out of Buston? I doubt whether he will have thecourage.""He has thought of that, Harry.""How thought of it, mother?""He has given orders that he is not to see you.""Not to see me!""So he declares. He has written a long letter to your father, in whichhe says that he would be spared the agony of an interview.""What! is it all done, then?""Your father got the letter yesterday. It must have taken my poorbrother a week to write it.""And he tells the whole plan,--Matilda Thoroughbung, and the futurefamily?""No, he does not say anything about Miss Thoroughbung He says that hemust make other arrangements about the property.""He can't make other arrangements; that is, not until the boy is born.It may be a long time first, you know.""But the jointure?""What does Molly say about it?""Molly is mad about it and so is Joshua. Joshua talks about it just asthough he were one of us, and he says that the old people at Buntingfordwould not hear of it." The old people spoken of were the father andmother of Joshua, and the half-brother of Miss Matilda Thoroughbung."But what can they do?""They can do nothing. If Miss Matilda likes Uncle Prosper--""Likes, my dear! How young you are! Of course she would like a countryhouse to live in, and the park, and the county society. And she wouldlike somebody to live with besides Miss Tickle.""My uncle, for instance.""Yes, your uncle.""If I had my choice, mother, I should prefer Miss Tickle.""Because you are a silly boy. But what are you to do now?""In this long letter which he has written to my father does he give noreason?""Your father will show you the letter. Of course he gives reasons. Hesays that you have done something which you ought not to havedone--about that wretched Mountjoy Scarborough.""What does he know about it?--the idiot!""Oh, Harry!""Well, mother, what better can I say of him? He has taken me as a childand fashioned my life for me; has said that this property should bemine, and has put an income into my hand as though I were an eldest son;has repeatedly declared, when his voice was more potent than mine, thatI should follow no profession. He has bound himself to me, telling allthe world that I was his heir. And now he casts me out because he hasheard some cock-and-bull story, of the truth of which he knows nothing.What better can I say of him than call him an idiot? He must be that orelse a heartless knave. And he says that he does not mean to see me,--mewith whose life he has thus been empowered to interfere, so as to blastit if not to bless it, and intends to turn me adrift as he might do adog that did not suit him! And because he knows that he cannot answer mehe declares that he will not see me.""It is very hard, Harry.""Therefore I call him an idiot in preference to calling him a knave. ButI am not going to be dropped out of the running in that way, just indeference to his will. I shall see him. Unless they lock him up in hisbedroom I shall compel him to see me.""What good would that do, Harry? That would only set him more againstyou.""You don't know his weakness.""Oh yes, I do; he is very weak.""He will not see me, because he will have to yield when he hears what Ihave to say for myself. He knows that, and would therefore fain keepaway from me. Why should he be stirred to this animosity against me?""Why indeed?""Because there is some one who wishes to injure me more strong than heis, and who has got hold of him. Some one has lied behind my back.""Who has done this?""Ah, that is the question. But I know who has done it, though I will notname him just now. This enemy of mine, knowing him to be weak,--knowinghim to be an idiot, has got hold of him and persuaded him. He believesthe story which is told to him, and then feels happy in shaking off anincubus. No doubt I have not been very soft with him,--nor, indeed, hard.I have kept out of his way, and he is willing to resent it; but he isafraid to face me and tell me that it is so. Here are the girls comeback from Buntingford. Molly, you blooming young bride, I wish you joyof your brewer.""He's none the worse on that account, Master Harry," said the eldestsister."All the better,--very much the better. Where would you be if he was nota brewer? But I congratulate you with all my heart, old girl. I haveknown him ever so long, and he is one of the best fellows I do know.""Thank you, Harry," and she kissed him."I wish Fanny and Kate may even do so well.""All in good time," said Fanny."I mean to have a banker--all to myself," said Kate."I wish you may have half as good a man for your husband," said Harry."And I am to tell you," continued Molly, who was now in highgood-humor, "that there will be always one of his horses for you to rideas long as you remain at home. It is not every brother-in-law that woulddo as much as that for you.""Nor yet every uncle," said Kate, shaking her head, from which Harrycould see that this quarrel with his uncle had been freely discussed inthe family circle."Uncles are very different," said the mother; "uncles can't be expectedto do everything as though they were in love.""Fancy Uncle Peter in love!" said Kate. Mr. Prosper was called UnclePeter by the girls, though always in a sort of joke. Then the other twogirls shook their heads very gravely, from which Harry learned that thequestion respecting the choice of Miss Matilda Thoroughbung as amistress for the Hall had been discussed also before them."I am not going to marry all the family," said Molly."Not Miss Matilda, for instance," said her brother, laughing."No, especially not Matilda. Joshua is quite as angry about his aunt asanybody here can be. You'll find that he is more of an Annesley than aThoroughbung.""My dear," said the mother, "your husband will, as a matter of course,think most of his own family. And so ought you to do of his family,which will be yours. A married woman should always think most of herhusband's family." In this way the mother told her daughter of herfuture duties; but behind the mother's back Kate made a grimace, for thebenefit of her sister Fanny, showing thereby her conviction that in amatter of blood,--what she called being a gentleman,--a Thoroughbung couldnot approach an Annesley."Mamma does not know it as yet," Molly said afterward in privacy to herbrother, "but you may take it for granted that Uncle Peter has been intoBuntingford and has made an offer to Aunt Matilda. I could tell it atonce, because she looked so sharp at me to-day. And Joshua says that heis sure it is so by the airs she gives herself.""You think she'll have him?""Have him! Of course she'll have him. Why shouldn't she? A wretched oldmaid living with a companion like that would have any one.""She has got a lot of money.""She'll take care of her money, let her alone for that."And she'll have his house to live in. And there'll be a jointure. Ofcourse, if there were to be children--""Oh, bother!""Well, perhaps there will not. But it will be just as bad. We don't meaneven to visit them; we think it so very wicked. And we shall tell them abit of our mind as soon as the thing has been publicly declared."CHAPTER XXIV.HARRY ANNESLEY'S MISERY.The conversation which took place that evening between Harry and hisfather was more serious in its language, though not more important inits purpose. "This is bad news, Harry," said the rector."Yes, indeed, sir."'"Your uncle, no doubt, can do as he pleases.""You mean as to the income he has allowed me?""As to the income! As to the property itself. It is bad waiting for deadmen's shoes.""And yet it is what everybody does in this world. No one can say that Ihave been at all in a hurry to step into my uncle's shoes. It was hethat first told you that he should never marry, and as the property hadbeen entailed on me, he undertook to bring me up as his son.""So he did.""Not a doubt about it, sir. But I had nothing to say to it. As far as Iunderstand, he has been allowing me two hundred and fifty pounds a yearfor the last dozen years.""Ever since you went to the Charter-house.""At that time I could not be expected to have a word to say to it. Andit has gone on ever since.""Yes, it has gone on ever since.""And when I was leaving Cambridge he required that I should not go intoa profession.""Not exactly that, Harry.""It was so that I understood it. He did not wish his heir to be burdenedwith a profession. He said so to me himself.""Yes, just when he was in his pride because you had got your fellowship.But there was a contract understood, if not made.""What contract?" asked Harry, with an air of surprise."That you should be to him as a son.""I never undertook it. I wouldn't have done it at the price,--or for anyprice. I never felt for him the respect or the love that were due to afather. I did feel both of them, to the full, for my own father. Theyare a sort of a thing which we cannot transfer.""They may be shared, Harry," said the rector, who was flattered."No, sir; in this instance that was not possible.""You might have sat by while he read a sermon to his sister and nieces.You understood his vanity, and you wounded it, knowing what you weredoing. I don't mean to blame you, but it was a misfortune. Now we mustlook it in the face and see what must be done. Your mother has told youthat he has written to me. There is his letter. You will see that hewrites with a fixed purpose." Then he handed to Harry a letter writtenon a large sheet of paper, the reading of which would be so long thatHarry seated himself for the operation.The letter need not here be repeated at length. It was written withinvolved sentences, but in very decided language. It said nothing ofHarry's want of duty, or not attending to the sermons, or of otherdeficiencies of a like nature, but based his resolution in regard tostopping the income on his nephew's misconduct,--as it appeared tohim,--in a certain particular case. And unfortunately,--though Harry wasprepared to deny that his conduct on that occasion had been subject tocensure,--he could not contradict any of the facts on which Mr. Prosperhad founded his opinion. The story was told in reference to MountjoyScarborough, but not the whole story. "I understand that there was a rowin the streets late at night, at the end of which young Mr. Scarboroughwas left as dead under the railings." "Left for dead!" exclaimed Harry."Who says that he was left for dead? I did not think him to be dead.""You had better read it to the end," said his father, and Harry read it.The letter went on to describe how Mountjoy Scarborough was missed fromhis usual haunts, how search was made by the police, how the newspaperswere filled with the strange incident, and how Harry had told nothing ofwhat had occurred. "But beyond this," the letter went on to say, "hepositively denied, in conversation with the gentleman's brother, that hehad anything to do with the gentleman on the night in question. If thisbe so, he absolutely lied. A man who would lie on such an occasion,knowing himself to have been guilty of having beaten the man in such away as to have probably caused his death,--for he had left him for deadunder the railings in a London street and in the midnight hour,--andwould positively assert to the gentleman's brother that he had not seenthe gentleman on the night in question, when he had every reason tobelieve that he had killed him,--a deed which might or might not bemurder,--is not fit to be recognized as my heir."There were other sentences equally long and equally complicated, in allof which Mr. Prosper strove to tell the story with tragic effect, butall of which had reference to the same transaction. He said nothing asto the ultimate destination of the property, nor of his own proposedmarriage. Should he have a son, that son would, of course, have theproperty. Should there be no son, Harry must have it, even though hisconduct might have been ever so abominable. To prevent this outrage onsociety, his marriage,--with its ordinary results,--would be the onlystep. Of that he need say nothing. But the two hundred and fifty poundswould not be paid after the Christmas quarter, and he must decline forthe future the honor of receiving Mr. Henry Annesley at the Hall.Harry, when he had read it all, began to storm with anger. The man, ashe truly observed, had grossly insulted him. Mr. Prosper had called hima liar and had hinted that he was a murderer. "You can do nothing tohim," his father said. "He is your uncle, and you have eaten his bread.""I can't call him out and fight him.""You must let it alone.""I can make my way into the house and see him.""I don't think you can do that. You will find it difficult to get beyondthe front-door, and I would advise you to abandon all such ideas. Whatcan you say to him?""It is false!""What is false? Though in essence it is false, in words it is true. Youdid deny that you had seen him.""I forget what passed. Augustus Scarborough endeavored to pump me abouthis brother, and I did not choose to be pumped. As far as I canascertain now, it is he that is the liar. He saw his brother after theaffair with me.""Has he denied it?""Practically he denies it by asking me the question. He asked me withthe ostensible object of finding out what had become of his brother whenhe himself knew what had become of him.""But you can't prove it. He positively says that you did deny havingseen him on the night in question, I am not speaking of AugustusScarborough, but of your uncle. What he says is true, and you had betterleave him alone. Take other steps for driving the real truth into hisbrain.""What steps can be taken with such a fool?""Write your own account of the transaction, so that he shall read it.Let your mother have it. I suppose he will see your mother.""And so beg his favor.""You need beg for nothing. Or if the marriage comes off--""You have heard of the marriage, sir?""Yes; I have heard of the marriage. I believe that he contemplates it.Put your statement of what did occur, and of your motives, into thehands of the lady's friends. He will be sure to read it.""What good will that do?""No good, but that of making him ashamed of himself. You have got toread the world a little more deeply than you have hitherto done. Hethinks that he is quarrelling with you about the affair in London, butit is in truth because you have declined to hear him read the sermonsafter having taken his money.""Then it is he that is the liar rather than I.""I, who am a moderate man, would say that neither is a liar. You did notchoose to be pumped, as you call it, and therefore spoke as you did.According to the world's ways that was fair enough. He, who is sore atthe little respect you have paid him, takes any ground of offence ratherthan that. Being sore at heart, he believes anything. This youngScarborough in some way gets hold of him, and makes him accept thiscock-and-bull story. If you had sat there punctual all those Sundayevenings, do you think he would have believed it then?""And I have got to pay such a penalty as this?" The rector could onlyshrug his shoulders. He was not disposed to scold his son. It was notthe custom of the house that Harry should be scolded. He was a fellow ofhis college and the heir to Buston, and was therefore considered to beout of the way of scolding. But the rector felt that his son had madehis bed and must now lie on it, and Harry was aware that this was hisfather's feeling.For two or three days he wandered about the country very down in themouth. The natural state of ovation in which the girls existed was initself an injury to him. How could he join them in their ovation, he whohad suffered so much? It seemed to be heartless that they should smileand rejoice when he,--the head of the family, as he had been taught toconsider himself,--was being so cruelly ill-used. For a day or two hehated Thoroughbung, though Thoroughbung was all that was kind to him. Hecongratulated him with cold congratulations, and afterward kept out ofhis way. "Remember, Harry, that up to Christmas you can always have oneof the nags. There's Belladonna and Orange Peel. I think you'd find themare a little the faster, though perhaps the horse is the biggerjumper." "Oh, thank you!" said Harry, and passed on. Now, Thoroughbungwas fond of his horses, and liked to have them talked about, and he knewthat Harry Annesley was treating him badly. But he was a good-humoredfellow, and he bore it without complaint. He did not even say a crossword to Molly. Molly, however, was not so patient. "You might be alittle more gracious when he's doing the best he can for you. It is notevery one who will lend you a horse to hunt for two months." Harry shookhis head, and wandered away miserable through the fields, and would notin these days even set his foot upon the soil of the park. "He was notgoing to intrude any farther," he said to the rector. "You can come tochurch, at any rate," his father said, "for he certainly will not bethere while you are at the parsonage." Oh yes, Harry would go to thechurch. "I have yet to understand that Mr. Prosper is owner of thechurch, and the path there from the rectory is, at any rate, open to thepublic;" for at Buston the church stands on one corner of the park.This went on for two or three days, during which nothing farther wassaid by the family as to Harry's woes. A letter was sent off to Mrs.Brown, telling her that the lodgings would not be required any longer,and anxious ideas began to crowd themselves on Harry's mind as to hisfuture residence. He thought that he must go back to Cambridge and takehis rooms at St. John's and look for college work. Two fatal years,years of idleness and gayety, had been passed, but still he thought thatit might be possible. What else was there open for him? And then, as heroamed about the fields, his mind naturally ran away to the girl heloved. How would he dare again to look Florence in the face? It was notonly the two hundred and fifty pounds per annum that was gone: thatwould have been a small income on which to marry. And he had never takenthe girl's own money into account. He had rather chosen to look forwardto the position as squire of Buston, and to take it for granted that itwould not be very long before he was called upon to fill the position.He had said not a word to Florence about money, but it was thus that hehad regarded the matter. Now the existing squire was going to marry, andthe matter could not so be regarded any longer. He saw half a dozenlittle Prospers occupying half a dozen little cradles, and a whole suiteof nurseries established at the Hall. The name of Prosper would be fixedat Buston, putting it altogether beyond his reach.In such circumstances would it not be reasonable that Florence shouldexpect him to authorize her to break their engagement? What was he nowbut the penniless son of a poor clergyman, with nothing on which todepend but a miserable stipend, which must cease were he to marry? Heknew that he ought to give her back her troth; and yet, as he thought ofdoing so, he was indignant with her. Was love to come to this? Was herregard for him to be counted as nothing? What right had he to expectthat she should be different from any other girl?Then he was more miserable than ever, as he told himself that such wouldundoubtedly be her conduct. As he walked across the fields, heavy withthe mud of a wet October day, there came down a storm of rain which wethim through. Who does not know the sort of sensation which falls upon aman when he feels that even the elements have turned against him,--how hebuttons up his coat and bids the clouds open themselves upon his devotedbosom?  "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage, blow,  You cataracts and hurricanes!"It is thus that a man is apt to address the soft rains of heaven when heis becoming wet through in such a frame of mind; and on the presentoccasion Harry likened himself to Leer. It was to him as though thesteeples were to be drenched and the cocks drowned when he found himselfwet through. In this condition he went back to the house, and so bitterto him were the misfortunes of the world that he would hardly condescendto speak while enduring them. But when he had entered the drawing-roomhis mother greeted him with a letter. It had come by the day mail, andhis mother looked into his face piteously as she gave it to him. Theletter was from Brussels, and she could guess from whom it had come. Itmight be a sweetly soft love-letter; but then it might be neither sweetnor soft, in the condition of things in which Harry was now placed. Hetook it and looked at it, but did not dare to open it on the spur of themoment. Without a word he went up to his room, and then tore it asunder.No doubt, he said to himself, it would allude to his miserable stipendand penniless condition. The letter ran as follows:"DEAREST HARRY,--I think it right to write to you, though mamma does notapprove of it. I have told her, however, that in the presentcircumstances I am bound to do so, and that I should implore you not toanswer. Though I must write, there must be no correspondence between us.Rumors have been received here very detrimental to your character."Harry gnashed his teeth as he read this. "Stories are told about yourmeeting with Captain Scarborough in London, which I know to be only inpart true. Mamma says that because of them I ought to give up myengagement, and my uncle, Sir Magnus, has taken upon himself to adviseme to do so. I have told them both that that which is said of you is inpart untrue; but whether it be true or whether it be false, I will nevergive up my engagement unless you ask me to do so. They tell me that asregards your pecuniary prospects you are ruined. I say that you cannotbe ruined as long as you have my income. It will not be much, but itwill, I should think, be enough."And now you can do as you please. You may be quite sure that I shall betrue to you, through ill report and good report. Nothing that mamma cansay to me will change me, and certainly nothing from Sir Magnus."And now there need not be a word from you, if you mean to be true tome. Indeed, I have promised that there shall be no word, and I expectyou to keep my promise for me. If you wish to be free of me, then youmust write and say so."But you won't wish it, and therefore I am yours, always, always, alwaysyour own"FLORENCE."Harry read the letter standing up in the middle of the room, and in halfa minute he had torn off his wet coat and kicked one of his wet boots tothe farther corner of the room. Then there was a knock at the door, andhis mother entered, "Tell me, Harry, what she says."He rushed up to his mother, all damp and half-shod as he was, and seizedher in his arms. "Oh, mother, mother!""What is it, dear?""Read that, and tell me whether there ever was a finer human being!"Mrs. Annesley did read it, and thought that her own daughter Molly wasjust as fine a creature. Florence was simply doing what any girl ofspirit would do. But she saw that her son was as jubilant now as he hadbeen downcast, and she was quite willing to partake of his comfort. "Notwrite a word to her! Ha, ha! I think I see myself at it!""But she seems to be in earnest there.""In earnest! And so am I in earnest. Would it be possible that a fellowshould hold his hand and not write? Yes, my girl; I think that I mustwrite a line. I wonder what she would say if I were not to write?""I think she means that you should be silent.""She has taken a very odd way of assuming it. I am to keep her promisefor her,--my darling, my angel, my life! But I cannot do that one thing.Oh, mother, mother, if you knew how happy I am! What the mischief doesit all signify,--Uncle Prosper, Miss Thoroughbung, and the rest ofit,--with a girl like that?"CHAPTER XXV.HARRY AND HIS UNCLE.Harry was kissed all round by the girls, and was congratulated warmly onthe heavenly excellence of his mistress. They could afford to begenerous if he would be good-natured. "Of course you must write to her,"said Molly, when he came down-stairs with dry clothes."I should think so, mother.""Only she does seem to be so much in earnest about it," said Mrs.Annesley."I think she would rather get just a line to say that he is in earnesttoo," said Fanny."Why should not she like a love-letter as much as any one else?" saidKate, who had her own ideas. "Of course she has to tell him about hermamma, but what need he care for that? Of course mamma thinks thatJoshua need not write to Molly, but Molly won't mind.""I don't think anything of the kind, miss.""And besides, Joshua lives in the next parish," said Fanny, "and has ahorse to ride over on if he has anything to say.""At any rate, I shall write," said Harry, "even at the risk of makingher angry." And he did write as follows:"BUSTON, _October_, 188--."MY OWN DEAR GIRL,--It is impossible that I should not send one line inanswer. Put yourself in my place, and consult your own feelings. Thinkthat you have a letter so full of love, so noble, so true, so certain tofill you with joy, and then say whether you would let it pass without aword of acknowledgment. It would be absolutely impossible. It is notvery probable that I should ask you to break your engagement, which inthe midst of my troubles is the only consolation I have. But when a manhas a rock to stand upon like that, he does not want anything else. Aslong as a man has the one person necessary to his happiness to believein him, he can put up with the ill opinion of all the others. You are tome so much that you outweigh all the world."I did not choose to have my secret pumped out of me by AugustusScarborough. I can tell you the whole truth now. Mountjoy Scarboroughhad told me that he regarded you as affianced to him, and required me tosay that I would--drop you. You know now how probable that was. He wasdrunk on the occasion,--had made himself purposely drunk, so as to getover all scruples,--and attacked me with his stick. Then came ascrimmage, in which he was upset. A sober man has always the best ofit." I am afraid that Harry put in that little word sober for a purpose.The opportunity of declaring that he was sober was too good too be lost."I went away and left him, certainly not dead, nor apparently much hurt.But if I told all this to Augustus Scarborough, your name must have comeout. Now I should not mind. Now I might tell the truth about you,--withgreat pride, if occasion required it. But I couldn't do it then. Whatwould the world have said to two men fighting in the streets about agirl, neither of whom had a right to fight about her? That was thereason why I told an untruth,--because I did not choose to fall into thetrap which Augustus Scarborough had laid for me."If your mother will understand it all, I do not think she will objectto me on that score. If she does quarrel with me, she will only befighting the Scarborough game, in which I am bound to oppose her. I amafraid the fact is that she prefers the Scarborough game,--not becauseof my sins, but from auld lang syne."But Augustus has got hold of my Uncle Prosper, and has done me aterrible injury. My uncle is a weak man, and has been predisposedagainst me from other circumstances. He thinks that I have neglectedhim, and is willing to believe anything against me. He has stopped myincome,--two hundred and fifty pounds a year,--and is going to revengehimself on me by marrying a wife. It is too absurd, and the proposedwife is aunt of the man whom my sister is going to marry. It makes sucha heap of confusion. Of course, if he becomes the father of a family Ishall be nowhere. Had I not better take to some profession? Only whatshall I take to? It is almost too late for the Bar. I must see you andtalk over it all."You have commanded me not to write, and now there is a long letter! Itis as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb. But when a man's characteris at stake he feels that he must plead for it. You won't be angry withme because I have not done all that you told me? It was absolutelynecessary that I should tell you that I did not mean to ask you to breakyour engagement, and one word has led to all the others. There shall beonly one other, which means more than all the rest:--that I am yours,dearest, with all my heart,"HARRY ANNESLEY.""There," he said to himself, as he put the letter into the envelope,"she may think it too long, but I am sure she would not have beenpleased had I not written at all."That afternoon Joshua was at the rectory, having just trotted over afterbusiness hours at the brewery because of some special word which had tobe whispered to Molly, and Harry put himself in his way as he went outto get on his horse in the stable-yard. "Joshua," he said, "I know thatI owe you an apology.""What for?""You have been awfully good to me about the horses, and I have been veryungracious.""Not at all.""But I have. The truth is, I have been made thoroughly miserable bycircumstances, and, when that occurs, a man cannot pick himself up allat once. It isn't my uncle that has made me wretched. That is a kind ofthing that a man has to put up with, and I think that I can bear it aswell as another. But an attack has been made upon me which has woundedme.""I know all about it.""I don't mind telling you, as you and Molly are going to hit it offtogether. There is a girl I love, and they have tried to interfere withher.""They haven't succeeded?""No, by George! And now I'm as right as a trivet. When it came across methat she might have--might have yielded, you know,--it was as though allhad been over. I ought not to have suspected her.""But she's all right?""Indeed she is. I think you'll like her when you see her some day. Ifyou don't, you have the most extraordinary taste I ever knew a man topossess. How about the horse?""I have four, you know.""What a grand thing it is to be a brewer!""And there are two of them will carry you. The other two are not quiteup to your weight.""You haven't been out yet?""Well, no;--not exactly out. The governor is the best fellow in theworld, but he draws the line at cub-hunting. He says the business shouldbe the business till November. Upon my word, I think he's right.""And how many days a week after that?""Well, three regular. I do get an odd day with the Essex sometimes, andthe governor winks.""The governor hunts himself as often as you.""Oh dear no; three a week does for the governor, and he is beginning tolike frosty weather, and to hear with pleasure that one of the oldhorses isn't as fit as he should be. He's what they call training off.Good-bye, old fellow. Mind you come out on the 7th of November."But Harry, though he had been made happy by the letter from Florence,had still a great many troubles on his mind. His first trouble was thehaving to do something in reference to his uncle. It did not appear tohim to be proper to accept his uncle's decision in regard to his income,without, at any rate, attempting to see Mr. Prosper. It would be asthough he had taken what was done as a matter of course,--as though hisuncle could stop the income without leaving him any ground of complaint.Of the intended marriage,--if it were intended,--he would say nothing. Hisuncle had never promised him in so many words not to marry, and therewould be, he thought, something ignoble in his asking his uncle not todo that which he intended to do himself without even consulting hisuncle about it. As he turned it all over in his mind he began to askhimself why his uncle should be asked to do anything for him, whereas hehad never done anything for his uncle. He had been told that he was theheir, not to the uncle, but to Buston, and had gradually been taught tolook upon Buston as his right,--as though he had a certain defeasibleproperty in the acres. He now began to perceive that there was no suchthing. A tacit contract had been made on his behalf, and he had declinedto accept his share of the contract. But he had been debarred fromfollowing any profession by his uncle's promised allowance. He did notthink that he could complain to his uncle about the proposed marriage;but he did think that he could ask a question or two as to the income.Without saying a word to any of his own family he walked across thepark, and presented himself at the front-door of Buston Hall. In doingso he would not go upon the grass. He had told his father that he wouldnot enter the park, and therefore kept himself to the road. And he haddressed himself with some little care, as a man does when he feels thathe is going forth on some mission of importance. Had he intended to callon old Mr. Thoroughbung there would have been no such care. And he rungat the front-door, instead of entering the house by any of the numerousside inlets with which he was well acquainted. The butler understood thering, and put on his company-coat when he answered the bell."Is my uncle at home, Matthew?" he said."Mr. Prosper, Mr. Harry? Well, no; I can't say that he just is;" and theold man groaned, and wheezed, and looked unhappy."He is not often out at this time." Matthew groaned again, and wheezedmore deeply, and looked unhappier. "I suppose you mean to say that hehas given orders that I am not to be admitted?" To this the butler madeno answer, but only looked woefully into the young man's face. "What isthe meaning of it all, Matthew?""Oh, Mr. Harry, you shouldn't ask me, as is merely a servant."Harry felt the truth of this rebuke, but was not going to put up withit."That's all my eye, Matthew; you know all about it as well as any one.It is so. He does not want to see me.""I don't think he does, Mr. Harry.""And why not? You know the whole of my family story as well as myfather does, or my uncle. Why does he shut his doors against me, andsend me word that he does not want to see me?""Well Mr. Harry, I'm not just able to say why he does it,--and you theheir. But if I was asked I should make answer that it has come along ofthem sermons." Then Matthew looked very serious, and bathed his head."I suppose so.""That was it, Mr. Harry. We, none of us, were very fond of the sermons.""I dare say not.""We in the kitchen. But we was bound to have them, or we should havelost our places.""And now I must lose my place." The butler said nothing, but his faceassented. "A little hard, isn't it, Matthew? But I wish to say a fewwords to my uncle,--not to express any regret about the sermons, but toask what it is that he intends to do." Here Matthew shook his head veryslowly. "He has given positive orders that I shall not be admitted?""It must be over my dead body, Mr. Harry," and he stood in the way withthe door in his hand, as though intending to sacrifice himself should hebe called upon to do so by the nature of the circumstances. Harry,however, did not put him to the test; but bidding him good-bye with somelittle joke as to his fidelity, made his way back to the parsonage.That night before he went to bed he wrote a letter to his uncle, as towhich he said not a word to either his father, or mother, or sisters. Hethought that the letter was a good letter, and would have been proud toshow it; but he feared that either his father or mother would advise himnot to send it, and he was ashamed to read it to Molly. He thereforesent the letter across the park the next morning by the gardener.The letter was as follows:"MY DEAR UNCLE,--My father has shown me your letter to him, and, ofcourse, I feel it incumbent on me to take some notice of it. Not wishingto trouble you with a letter I called this morning, but I was told byMatthew that you would not see me. As you have expressed yourself to myfather very severely as to my conduct, I am sure you will agree with methat I ought not to let the matter pass by without making my owndefence."You say that there was a row in the streets between MountjoyScarborough and myself in which he was 'left for dead.' When I left himI did not think he had been much hurt, nor have I had reason to think sosince. He had attacked me, and I had simply defended myself. He had comeupon me by surprise; and, when I had shaken him off, I went away. Thenin a day or two he had disappeared. Had he been killed, or much hurt,the world would have heard of it: but the world simply heard that he haddisappeared, which could hardly have been the case had he been muchhurt."Then you say that I denied, in conversation with Augustus Scarborough,that I had seen his brother on the night in question. I did deny it.Augustus Scarborough, who was evidently well acquainted with the wholetransaction, and who had, I believe, assisted his brother indisappearing, wished to learn from me what I had done, and to hide whathe had done. He wished to saddle me with the disgrace of his brother'sdeparture, and I did not choose to fall into his trap. At the moment ofhis asking me he knew that his brother was safe. I think that the word'lie,' as used by you, is very severe for such an occurrence. A man isnot generally held to be bound to tell everything respecting himself tothe first person that shall ask him. If you will ask any man who knowsthe world,--my father, for instance,--I think you will be told that suchconduct was not faulty."But it is at any rate necessary that I should ask you what you intendto do in reference to my future life. I am told that you intend to stopthe income which I have hitherto received. Will this be considerate onyour part?" (In his first copy of the letter Harry had asked whether itwould be "fair," and had then changed the word for one that was milder.)"When I took my degree you yourself said that it would not be necessarythat I should go into any profession, because you would allow me anincome, and would then provide for me, I took your advice in oppositionto my father's, because it seemed then that I was to depend on yourather than on him. You cannot deny that I shall have been treatedhardly if I now be turned loose upon the world."I shall be happy to come and see you if you shall wish it, so as tosave you the trouble of writing to me."Your affectionate nephew,"HENRY ANNESLEY."Harry might have been sure that his uncle would not see him,--probablywas sure when he added the last paragraph. Mr. Prosper enjoyed greatlytwo things,--the mysticism of being invisible and the opportunity ofwriting a letter. Mr. Prosper had not a large correspondence, but it waslaborious, and, as he thought, effective. He believed that he did knowhow to write a letter, and he went about it with a will. It was notprobable that he would make himself common by seeing his nephew on suchan occasion, or that he would omit the opportunity of spending an entiremorning with pen and ink. The result was very short, but, to his idea,it was satisfactory."SIR," he began. He considered this matter very deeply; but as theentire future of his own life was concerned in it he felt that it becamehim to be both grave and severe."I have received your letter and have read it with attention. I observethat you admit that you told Mr. Augustus Scarborough a deliberateuntruth. This is what the plain-speaking world, when it wishes to beunderstood as using the unadorned English language, which is always thelanguage which I prefer myself, calls a lie--A LIE! I do not choose thatthis humble property shall fall at my death into the hands of A LIAR.Therefore I shall take steps to prevent it,--which may or may not besuccessful."As such steps, whatever may be their result, are to be taken, theincome,--intended to prepare you for another alternative, which maypossibly not now be forth-coming,--will naturally now be no longerallowed.--I am, sir, your obedient servant, PETER PROSPER."The first effect of the letter was to produce laughter at the rectory.Harry could not but show it to his father, and in an hour or two itbecame known to his mother and sister, and, under an oath of secrecy, toJoshua Thoroughbung. It could not be matter of laughter when the futurehopes of Miss Matilda Thoroughbung were taken into consideration. "Ideclare I don't know what you are all laughing about," said Kate,"except that Uncle Peter does use such comical phrases." But Mrs.Annesley, though the most good-hearted woman in the world, was almostangry. "I don't know what you all see to laugh at in it. Peter has inhis hands the power of making or marring Harry's future.""But he hasn't," said Harry."Or he mayn't have," said the rector."It's all in the hands of the Almighty," said Mrs. Annesley, who feltherself bound to retire from the room and to take her daughter with her.But, when they were alone, both the father and his son were very angry."I have done with him forever," said Harry. "Let come what may, I willnever see him or speak to him again. A 'lie,' and 'liar!' He has writtenthose words in that way so as to salve his own conscience for theinjustice he is doing. He knows that I am not a liar. He cannotunderstand what a liar means, or he would know that he is one himself.""A man seldom has such knowledge as that.""Is it not so when he stigmatizes me in this way merely as an excuse tohimself? He wants to be rid of me,--probably because I did not sit andhear him read the sermons. Let that pass. I may have been wrong in that,and he may be justified; but because of that he cannot believe reallythat I have been a liar,--a liar in such a determined way as to make meunfit to be his heir.""He is a fool, Harry! That is the worst of him.""I don't think it is the worst.""You cannot have worse. It is dreadful to have to depend on a fool,--tohave to trust to a man who cannot tell wrong from right. Your uncleintends to be a good man. If it were brought home to him that he weredoing a wrong he would not do it. He would not rob; he would not steal;he must not commit murder, and the rest of it. But he is a fool, and hedoes not know when he is doing these things.""I will wash my hands of him.""Yes; and he will wash his hands of you. You do not know him as I do. Hehas taken it into his silly head that you are the chief of sinnersbecause you said what was not true to that man, who seems really to bethe sinner, and nothing will eradicate the idea. He will go and marrythat woman because he thinks that in that way he can best carry hispurpose, and then he will repent at leisure. I used to tell you that youhad better listen to the sermons.""And now I must pay for it!""Well, my boy, it is no good crying for spilt milk. As I was saying justnow, there is nothing worse than a fool."CHAPTER XXVI.MARMADUKE LODGE.On the 7th of next month two things occurred, each of great importance.Hunting commenced in the Puckeridge country, and Harry with that famousmare Belladonna was there. And Squire Prosper was driven in his carriageinto Buntingford, and made his offer with all due formality to MissThoroughbung. The whole household, including Matthew, and the cook, andthe coachman, and the boy, and the two house-maids, knew what he wasgoing to do. It would be difficult to say how they knew, because he wasa man who never told anything. He was the last man in England who, onsuch a matter, would have made a confidant of his butler. He never spoketo a servant about matters unconnected with their service. He consideredthat to do so would be altogether against his dignity. Nevertheless whenhe ordered his carriage, which he did not do very frequently at thistime of the year, when the horses were wanted on the farm,--and of whichhe gave twenty-four hours' notice to all the persons concerned,--and whenearly in the morning he ordered that his Sunday suit should be preparedfor wearing, and when his aspect grew more and more serious as the hourdrew nigh, it was well understood by them all that he was going to makethe offer that day.He was both proud and fearful as to the thing to be done,--proud that he,the Squire of Buston, should be called on to take so important a step;proud by anticipation of his feelings as he would return home a jollythriving wooer,--and yet a little fearful lest he might not succeed. Werehe to fail the failure would be horrible to him. He knew that every manand woman about the place would know all about it. Among the secrets ofthe family there was a story, never now mentioned, of his having donethe same thing, once before. He was then a young man, about twenty-five,and he had come forth to lay himself and Buston at the feet of abaronet's daughter who lived some twenty-five miles off. She was verybeautiful, and was said to have a fitting dower, but he had come back,and had shut himself up in the house for a week afterward. To no humanears had he ever since spoken of his interview with Miss Courteney. Thedoings of that day had been wrapped in impenetrable darkness. But allBuston and the neighboring parishes had known that Miss Courteney hadrefused him. Since that day he had never gone forth again on such amission.There were those who said of him that his love had been so deep andenduring that he had never got the better of it. Miss Courteney had beenmarried to a much grander lover, and had been taken off to splendidcircles. But he had never mentioned her name. That story of his abidinglove was throughly believed by his sister, who used to tell it of him tohis credit when at the rectory the rector would declare him to be afool. But the rector used to say that he was dumb from pride, or that hecould not bear to have it known that he had failed at anything. At anyrate, he had never again attempted love, and had formally declared tohis sister that, as he did not intend to marry, Harry should be regardedas his son. Then at last had come the fellowship, and he had been proudof his heir, thinking that in some way he had won the fellowshiphimself, as he had paid the bills. But now all was altered, and he wasto go forth to his wooing again.There had been a rumor about the country that he was already accepted;but such was not the case. He had fluttered about Buntingford, thinkingof it: but he had never put the question. To his thinking it would nothave been becoming to do so without some ceremony. Buston was not to bemade away during the turnings of a quadrille or as a part of an ordinaryconversation. It was not probable,--nay, it was impossible,--that heshould mention the subject to any one; but still he must visibly preparefor it, and I think that he was aware that the world around him knewwhat he was about.And the Thoroughbung's knew, and Miss Matilda Thoroughbung knew well.All Buntingford knew. In those old days in which he had sought the handof the baronet's daughter, the baronet's daughter, and the baronet'swife, and the baronet himself, had known what was coming, though Mr.Prosper thought that the secret dwelt alone in his own bosom. Nor did hedream now that Harry and Harry's father, and Harry's mother and sisters,had all laughed at the conspicuous gravity of his threat. It was thegeneral feeling on the subject which made the rumor current that thedeed had been done. But when he came down-stairs with one new graykid-glove on, and the other dangling in his hand, nothing had been done."Drive to Buntingford," said the squire."Yes, sir," said Matthew, the door of the carriage in his hand."To Marmaduke Lodge.""Yes, sir." Then Matthew told the coachman, who had heard theinstructions very plainly, and knew them before he had heard them. Thesquire threw himself back in the carriage, and applied himself towondering how he should do the deed. He had, in truth, barely studiedthe words,--but not, finally, the manner of delivering them. With hisbare hand up to his eyes so that he might hold the glove unsoiled in theother, he devoted his intellect to the task; nor did he withdraw hishand till the carriage turned in at the gate. The drive up to the doorof Marmaduke Lodge was very short, and he had barely time to arrange hiswaistcoat and his whiskers before the carriage stood still. He was soontold that Miss Thoroughbung was at home, and within a moment he foundhimself absolutely standing on the carpet in her presence.Report had dealt unkindly with Miss Thoroughbung in the matter of herage. Report always does deal unkindly with unmarried young women whohave ceased to be girls. There is an idea that they will wish to makethemselves out to be younger than they are, and therefore report alwaysmakes them older. She had been called forty-five, and even fifty. Herexact age at this moment was forty-two, and as Mr. Prosper was onlyfifty there was no discrepancy in the marriage. He would have beenyoung-looking for his age, but for an air of ancient dandyism which hadgrown upon him. He was somewhat dry, too, and skinny, with highcheekbones and large dull eyes. But he was clean, and grave, andorderly,--a man promising well to a lady on the lookout for a husband.Miss Thoroughbung was fat, fair, and forty to the letter, and she had ajust measure of her own good looks, of which she was not unconscious.But she was specially conscious of twenty-five thousand pounds, thepossession of which had hitherto stood in the way of her search after ahusband. It was said commonly about Buntingford that she looked toohigh, seeing that she was only a Thoroughbung and had no more thantwenty-five thousand pounds.But Miss Tickle was in the room, and might have been said to be in theway, were it not that a little temporary relief was felt by Mr. Prosperto be a comfort. Miss Tickle was at any rate twenty years older thanMiss Thoroughbung, and was of all slaves at the same time the humblestand the most irritating. She never asked for anything, but was alwayspainting the picture of her own deserts. "I hope I have the pleasure ofseeing Miss Tickle quite well," said the squire, as soon as he had paidhis first compliments to the lady of his love."Thank you, Mr. Prosper, pretty well. My anxiety is all for Matilda."Matilda had been Matilda to her since she had been a little girl, andMiss Tickle was not going now to drop the advantage which the oldintimacy gave her."I trust there is no cause for it.""Well, I'm not so sure. She coughed a little last night, and would noteat her supper. We always do have a little supper. A despatched crab itwas; and when she would not eat it I knew there was something wrong.""Nonsense! what a fuss you make. Well, Mr. Prosper, have you seen yournephew yet?""No, Miss Thoroughbung; nor do I intend to see him. The young man hasdisgraced himself.""Dear, dear; how sad!""Young men do disgrace themselves, I fear, very often," said MissTickle."We won't talk about it, if you please, because it is a family affair.""Oh no," said Miss Thoroughbung."At least, not as yet. It may be;--but never mind, I would not wish to bepremature in anything.""I am always telling Matilda so. She is so impulsive. But as you mayhave matters of business, Mr. Prosper, on which to speak to MissThoroughbung, I will retire.""It is very thoughtful on your part, Miss Tickle."Then Miss Tickle retired; from which it may be surmised that theprobable circumstances of the interview had been already discussedbetween the ladies. Mr. Prosper drew a long breath, and sighed audibly,as soon as he was alone with the object of his affections. He wonderedwhether men were ever bright and jolly in such circumstances. He sighedagain, and then he began: "Miss Thoroughbung!""Mr. Prosper!"All the prepared words had flown from his memory. He could not evenbethink himself how he ought to begin. And, unfortunately, so much mustdepend upon manner! But the property was unembarrassed, and MissThoroughbung thought it probable that she might be allowed to do whatshe would with her own money. She had turned it all over to the rightand to the left, and she was quite minded to accept him. With this viewshe had told Miss Tickle to leave the room, and she now felt that shewas bound to give the gentleman what help might be in her power. "Oh,Miss Thoroughbung!" he said."Mr. Prosper, you and I are such good friends, that--that--that--""Yes, indeed. You can have no more true friend than I am,--not even MissTickle.""Oh, bother Miss Tickle! Miss Tickle is very well.""Exactly so. Miss Tickle is very well; a most estimable person.""We'll leave her alone just at present.""Yes, certainly. We had better leave her alone in our presentconversation. Not but what I have a strong regard for her." Mr. Prosperhad surely not thought of the opening he might be giving as to a futurecareer for Miss Tickle by such an assertion."So have I, for the matter of that, but we'll drop her just now." Thenshe paused, but he paused also. "You have come over to Buntingfordto-day probably in order that you might congratulate them at the breweryon the marriage with one of your family." Then Mr. Prosper frowned, butshe did not care for his frowning. "It will not be a bad match for theyoung lady, as Joshua is fairly steady, and the brewery is worth money.""I could have wished him a better brother-in-law," said the lover, whowas taken away from the consideration of his love by the allusion to theAnnesleys. He had thought of all that, and in the dearth of fittingobjects of affection had resolved to endure the drawback of theconnection. But it had for a while weighed very seriously with him, sothat had the twenty-five thousand pounds been twenty thousand pounds, hemight have taken himself to Miss Puffle, who lived near Saffron Waldenand who would own Snickham Manor when her father died. The property wassaid to be involved, and Miss Puffle was certainly forty-eight. As anheir was the great desideratum, he had resolved that Matilda Thoroughbungshould be the lady, in spite of the evils attending the new connection.He did feel that in throwing over Harry he would have to abandon all theAnnesleys, and to draw a line between himself with Miss Thoroughbung andthe whole family of the Thoroughbungs generally."You mustn't be too bitter against poor Molly," said Miss Thoroughbung.Mr. Prosper did not like to be called bitter, and, in spite of theimportance of the occasion, could not but show that he did not like it."I don't think that we need talk about it.""Oh dear no. Kate and Miss Tickle need neither of them be talkedabout." Mr. Prosper disliked all familiarity, and especially that ofbeing laughed at, but Miss Thoroughbung did laugh. So he drew himselfup, and dangled his glove more slowly than before. "Then you were notgoing on to congratulate them at the brewery?""Certainly not.""I did not know.""My purpose carries me no farther than Marmaduke Lodge. I have no desireto see any one to-day besides Miss Thoroughbung.""That is a compliment."Then his memory suddenly brought back to him one of his composedsentences. "In beholding Miss Thoroughbung I behold her on whom I hope Imay depend for all the future happiness of my life." He did feel that ithad come in the right place. It had been intended to be said immediatelyafter her acceptance of him. But it did very well where it was. Itexpressed, as he assured himself, the feelings of his heart, and mustdraw from her some declaration of hers."Goodness gracious me, Mr. Prosper!"This sort of coyness was to have been expected, and he thereforecontinued with another portion of his prepared words, which now cameglibly enough to him. But it was a previous portion. It was all the sameto Miss Thoroughbung, as it declared plainly the gentleman's intention."If I can induce you to listen to me favorably, I shall say of myselfthat I am the happiest gentleman in Hertfordshire.""Oh, Mr. Prosper!""My purpose is to lay at your feet my hand, my heart, and the lands ofBuston." Here he was again going backward, but it did not much matternow in what sequence the words were said. The offer had been thoroughlycompleted and was thoroughly understood."A lady, Mr. Prosper, has to think of these things," said MissThoroughbung."Of course I would not wish to hurry you prematurely to any declarationof your affections.""But there are other considerations, Mr. Prosper. You know about myproperty?""Nothing particularly. It has not been a matter of consideration withme." This he said with some slight air of offence. He was a gentleman,whereas Miss Thoroughbung was hardly a lady. Matter of consideration hermoney of course had been. How should he not consider it? But he wasaware that he ought not to rush on that subject, but should leave it tothe arrangement of lawyers, expressing his own views through her ownlawyer. To her it was the thing of most importance, and she had nofeelings which induced her to be silent on a matter so near to her. Sherushed."But it has to be considered, Mr. Prosper. It is all my own, and comesto very nearly one thousand a year. I think it is nine hundred andseventy-two pounds six shillings and eightpence. Of course, when thereis so much money it would have to be tied up somehow." Mr. Prosper wasundoubtedly disgusted, and if he could have receded at this moment wouldhave transferred his affections to Miss Puffle. "Of course youunderstand that."She had not accepted him as yet, nor said a word of her regard for him.All that went, it seemed, as a matter of no importance whatever. He hadbeen standing for the last few minutes, and now he remained standing andlooking at her. They were both silent, so that he was obliged to speak."I understand that between a lady and gentleman so circumstanced thereshould be a settlement.""Just so.""I also have some property," said Mr. Prosper, with a touch of pride inhis tone."Of course you have. Goodness gracious me! Why else would you come? Youhave got Buston, which I suppose is two thousand a year. At any rate ithas that name. But it isn't your own.""Not my own?""Well, no. You couldn't leave it to your widow, so that she might giveit to any one she pleased when you were gone." Here the gentlemanfrowned very darkly, and thought that after all Miss Puffle would be thewoman for him. "All that has to be considered, and it makes Buston notexactly your own. If I were to have a daughter she wouldn't have it.""No, not a daughter," said Mr. Prosper, still wondering at the thoroughknowledge of the business in hand displayed by the lady."Oh, if it were to be a son, that would be all right, and then my moneywould go to the younger children, divided equally between the boys andgirls." Mr. Prosper shook his head as he found himself suddenly providedwith so plentiful and thriving a family. "That, I suppose, would be theway of the settlement, together with a certain income out of Buston setapart for my use. It ought to be considered that I should have toprovide a house to live in. This belongs to my brother, and I pay himforty pounds a year for it. It should be something better than this.""My dear Miss Thoroughbung, the lawyer would do all that." There didcome upon him an idea that she, with her aptitude for business, wouldnot be altogether a bad helpmate."The lawyers are very well; but in a transaction of this kind there isnothing like the principals understanding each other. Young women arealways robbed when their money is left altogether to the gentlemen.""Robbed!""Don't suppose I mean you, Mr. Prosper; and the robbery I mean is notconsidered disgraceful at all. The gentlemen I mean are the fathers andthe brothers, and the uncles and the lawyers. And they intend to doright after the custom of their fathers and uncles. But woman's rightsare coming up.""I hate woman's rights.""Nevertheless they are coming up. A young woman doesn't get taken in asshe used to do. I don't mean any offence, you know." This was said inreply to Mr. Prosper's repeated frown. "Since woman's rights have comeup a young woman is better able to fight her own battle."Mr. Prosper was willing to admit that Miss Thoroughbung was fair, butshe was fat also, and at least forty. There was hardly need that sheshould refer so often to her own unprotected youth. "I should like tohave the spending of my own income, Mr. Prosper;--that's a fact.""Oh, indeed!""Yes, I should. I shouldn't care to have to go to my husband if I wantedto buy a pair of stockings.""An allowance, I should say.""And that should be my own income.""Nothing to go to the house?""Oh yes. There might be certain things which I might agree to pay for. Apair of ponies I should like.""I always keep a carriage and a pair of horses.""But the ponies would be my lookout. I shouldn't mind paying for my ownmaid, and the champagne, and my clothes, of course, and thefish-monger's bill. There would be Miss Tickle, too. You said you wouldlike Miss Tickle. I should have to pay for her. That would be aboutenough, I think."Mr. Prosper was thoroughly disgusted; but when he left Marmaduke Lodgehe had not said a word as to withdrawing from his offer. She declaredthat she would put her terms into writing and give them to her lawyer,who would communicate with Mr. Grey.Mr. Prosper was surprised to find that she knew the name of his lawyer,who was in truth our old friend. And then, while he was stillhesitating, she astounded,--nay, shocked him by her mode of ending theconference. She got up and, throwing her arms round his neck, kissed himmost affectionately. After that there was no retreating for Mr.Prosper,--no immediate mode of retreat, at all events. He could only backout of the room, and get into his carriage, and be carried home asquickly as possible.CHAPTER XXVII.THE PROPOSAL.It had never happened to him before. The first thought that came uponMr. Prosper, when he got into his carriage, was that it had neveroccurred to him before. He did not reflect that he had not put himselfin the way of it: but now the strangeness of the sensation overwhelmedhim. He inquired of himself whether it was pleasant, but he foundhimself compelled to answer the question with a negative. It should havecome from him, but not yet; not yet, probably, for some weeks. But ithad been done, and by the doing of it she had sealed him utterly as herown. There was no getting out of it now. He did feel that he ought notto attempt to get out of it after what had taken place. He was not surebut that the lady had planned it all with that purpose; but he was surethat a strong foundation had been laid for a breach of promise case ifhe were to attempt to escape. What might not a jury do against him,giving damages out of the acres of Buston Hall? And then MissThoroughbung would go over to the other Thoroughbungs and to theAnnesleys, and his condition would become intolerable. In some moments,as he was driven home, he was not sure but that it had all been got upas a plot against him by the Annesleys.When he got out of his carriage Matthew knew that things had gone badlywith his master; but he could not conjecture in what way. The matter hadbeen fully debated in the kitchen, and it had been there decided thatMiss Thoroughbung was certainly to be brought home as the futuremistress of Buston. The step to be taken by their master was notpopular in the Buston kitchen. It had been there considered that MasterHarry was to be the future master, and, by some perversity of intellect,they had all thought that this would occur soon. Matthew was much olderthan the squire, who was hardly to be called a sickly man, and yetMatthew had made up his mind that Mr. Harry was to reign over him asSquire of Buston. When, therefore, the tidings came that MissThoroughbung was to brought to Buston as the mistress, there had beensome slight symptoms of rebellion. "They didn't want any 'TildaThoroughbung there." They had their own idea of a lady and a gentleman,which, as in all such cases, was perfectly correct. They knew the squireto be a fool, but they believed him to be a gentleman. They heard thatMiss Thoroughbung was a clever woman, but they did not believe her to bea lady. Matthew had said a few words to the cook as to a public-house atStevenage. She had told him not to be an old fool, and that he wouldlose his money, but she had thought of the public-house. There had beena mutinous feeling. Matthew helped his master out of the carriage, andthen came a revulsion. That "froth of a beer-barrel," as Matthew haddared to call her, had absolutely refused his master.Mr. Prosper went into the house very meditative, and sad at heart. Itwas a matter almost of regret to him that it had not been as Matthewsupposed. But he was caught and bound, and must make the best of it. Hethought of all the particulars of her proposed mode of living, andrecapitulated them to himself. A pair of ponies, her own maid,champagne, the fish-monger's bill, and Miss Tickle. Miss Puffle wouldcertainly not have required such expensive luxuries. Champagne and thefish would require company for their final consumption.The ponies assumed a tone of being quite opposed to that which he hadcontemplated. He questioned with himself whether he would like MissTickle as a perpetual inmate. He had, in sheer civility, expressed aliking for Miss Tickle, but what need could there be to a married womanof a Miss Tickle? And then he thought of the education of the five orsix children which she had almost promised him! He had suggested tohimself simply an heir,--just one heir,--so that the nefarious Harry mightbe cut out. He already saw that he would not be enriched to the extentof a shilling by the lady's income. Then there would be all the troubleand the disgrace of a separate purse. He felt that there would bedisgrace in having the fish and champagne, which were consumed in hisown house,--paid for by his wife without reference to him. What if thelady had a partiality for champagne? He knew nothing about it, and wouldknow nothing about it, except when he saw it in her heightened color.Despatched crabs for supper! He always went to bed at ten, and had atumbler of barley-water brought to him,--a glass of barley-water withjust a squeeze of lemon-juice.He saw ruin before him. No doubt she was a good manager, but she wouldbe a good manager for herself. Would it not be better for him to standthe action for breach of promise, and betake himself to Miss Puffle? ButMiss Puffle was fifty, and there could be no doubt that the lady oughtto be younger than the gentleman. He was much distressed in mind. If hebroke off with Miss Thoroughbung, ought he to do so at once, before shehad had time to put the matter into the hands of the lawyer? And on whatplea should he do it? Before he went to bed that night he did draw out aportion of a letter, which, however, was never sent:"MY DEAR MISS THOROUGHBUNG,--In the views which we both promulgated thismorning I fear that there was some essential misunderstanding as to themode of life which had occurred to both of us. You, as was so natural atyour age, and with your charms, have not been slow to anticipate acoming period of uncheckered delights. Your allusion to a pony-carriage,and other incidental allusions,"--he did not think it well to mentionmore particularly the fish and the champagne,--"have made clear the sortof future life which you have pictured to yourself. Heaven forbid that Ishould take upon myself to find fault with anything so pleasant and soinnocent! But my prospects of life are different, and in seeking thehonor of an alliance with you I was looking for a quiet companion in mydeclining years, and it might be also to a mother to a possible futureson. When you honored me with an unmistakable sign of your affection, onmy going, I was just about to explain all this. You must excuse me if mymouth was then stopped by the mutual ardor of our feeling. I was aboutto say--" But he had found it difficult to explain what he had beenabout to say, and on the next morning, when the time for writing hadcome, he heard news which detained him for the day, and then theopportunity was gone.On the following morning, when Matthew appeared at his bedside with hiscup of tea at nine o'clock, tidings were brought him. He took in theBuntingford _Gazette_, which came twice a week, and as Matthew laid it,opened and unread, in its accustomed place, he gave the information,which he had no doubt gotten from the paper. "You haven't heard it, sir,I suppose, as yet?""Heard what?""About Miss Puffle.""What about Miss Puffle? I haven't heard a word. What about MissPuffle?" He had been thinking that moment of Miss Puffle,--of how shewould be superior to Miss Thoroughbung in many ways,--so that he sat upin his bed, holding the untasted tea in his hand."She's gone off with young Farmer Tazlehurst.""Miss Puffle gone off, and with her father's tenant's son!""Yes indeed, sir. She and her father have been quarrelling for the lastten years, and now she's off. She was always riding and roistering aboutthe country with them dogs and them men; and now she's gone.""Oh heavens!" exclaimed the squire, thinking of his own escape."Yes, indeed, sir. There's no knowing what any one of them is up to.Unless they gets married afore they're thirty, or thirty-five at most,they're most sure to get such ideas into their head as no one can mostlyapprove." This had been intended by Matthew as a word of caution to hismaster, but had really the opposite effect. He resolved at the momentthat the latter should not be said of Miss Thoroughbung.And he turned Matthew out of the room with a flea in his ear. "How dareyou speak in that way of your betters? Mr. Puffle, the lady's father,has for many years been my friend. I am not saying anything of the lady,nor saying that she has done right. Of course, down-stairs, in theservants' hall, you can say what you please; but up here, in mypresence, you should not speak in such language of a lady behind whosechair you may be called upon to wait.""Very well, sir; I won't no more," said Matthew, retiring with mockhumility. But he had shot his bolt, and he supposed successfully. He didnot know what had taken place between his master and Miss Thoroughbung;but he did think that his speech might assist in preventing a repetitionof the offer.Miss Puffle gone off with the tenant's son! The news made matrimonydoubly dangerous to him, and yet robbed him of the chief reason bywhich he was to have been driven to send her a letter. He could not, atany rate, now fall back upon Miss Puffle. And he thought that nothingwould have induced Miss Thoroughbung to go off with one of the cartersfrom the brewery. Whatever faults she might have, they did not lie inthat direction. Champagne and ponies were, as faults, less deleterious.Miss Puffle gone off with young Tazlehurst,--a lady of fifty, with ayoung man of twenty-five! and she the reputed heiress of Snickham Manor!It was a comfort to him as he remembered that Snickham Manor had beenbought no longer ago than by the father of the present owner. TheProspers been at Buston ever since the time of George the First. Youcannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. He had been ever assuringhimself of that fact, which was now more of a fact than ever. And fiftyyears old! It was quite shocking. With a steady middle-aged man likehimself, and with the approval of her family, marriage might have beenthought of. But this harum-scarum young tenant's son, who was in norespect a gentleman, whose only thought was of galloping over hedges andditches, such an idea showed a state of mind which--well, absolutelydisgusted him. Mr. Prosper, because he had grown old himself, could notendure to think that others, at his age, should retain a smack of theiryouth. There are ladies besides Miss Puffle who like to ride across thecountry with a young man before them, or perhaps following, and neverthink much of their fifty years.But the news certainly brought to him a great change of feelings, sothat the letter to which he had devoted the preceding afternoon was putback into the letter-case, and was never finished. And his mindimmediately recurred to Miss Thoroughbung, and he bethought himself thatthe objection which he felt was, perhaps, in part frivolous. At anyrate, she was a better woman than Miss Puffle. She certainly would runafter no farmer's son. Though she might be fond of champagne, itwas, he thought, chiefly for other people. Though she was ambitious ofponies, the ambition might be checked. At any rate, she could pay forher own ponies, whereas Mr. Puffle was a very hale old man of seventy.Puffle, he told himself, had married young, and might live for the nextten years, or twenty. To Mr. Prosper, whose imagination did not fly farafield, the world afforded at present but two ladies. These were MissPuffle and Miss Thoroughbung, and as Miss Puffle had fallen out of therunning, there seemed to be a walk-over for Miss Thoroughbung.He did think, during the two or three days which passed without anyfarther step on his part,--he did think how it might be were he to remainunmarried. As regarded his own comfort, he was greatly tempted. Lifewould remain so easy to him! But then duty demanded of him that heshould marry, and he was a man who, in honest, sober talk, thought muchof his duty. He was absurdly credulous, and as obstinate as a mule. Buthe did wish to do what was right. He had been convinced that HarryAnnesley was a false knave, and had been made to swear an oath thatHarry should not be his heir. Harry had been draped in the blackestcolors, and to each daub of black something darker had been added by hisuncle's memory of those neglected sermons. It was now his first duty inlife to beget an heir, and for that purpose a wife must be had.Putting aside the ponies and the champagne,--and the despatched crab, thesound of which, as coming to him from Miss Tickle's mouth, was uglierthan the other sounds,--he still thought that Miss Thoroughbung wouldanswer his purpose. From her side there would not be making of a silkpurse; but then "the boy" would be his boy as well as hers, and wouldprobably take more after the father. He passed much of these days withthe "Peerage" in his hand, and satisfied himself that the best blood hadbeen maintained frequently by second-rate marriages. Health was a greatthing. Health in the mother was everything. Who could be more healthythan Miss Thoroughbung? Then he thought of that warm embrace. Perhaps,after all, it was right that she should embrace him after what he hadsaid to her.Three days only had passed by, and he was still thinking what ought tobe his next step, when there came to him a letter from Messrs. Soames &Simpson, attorneys in Buntingford. He had heard of Messrs. Soames &Simpson, had been familiar with their names for the last twenty years,but had never dreamed that his own private affairs should become amatter of consultation in their office. Messrs. Grey & Barry, ofLincoln's Inn, were his lawyers, who were quite gentlemen. He knewnothing against Messrs. Soames & Simpson, but he thought that their workconsisted generally in the recovery of local debts. Messrs. Soames &Simpson now wrote to him with full details as to his future life. Theirclient Miss Thoroughbung, had communicated to them his offer ofmarriage. They were acquainted with all the lady's circumstances, andshe had asked them for their advice. They had proposed to her that theuse of her own income should be by deed left to herself. Some proportionof it should go into the house, and might be made matter of agreement.They suggested that an annuity of a thousand pounds a year, in shape ofdower, should be secured to their client in the event of her outlivingMr. Prosper. The estate should, of course, be settled on the eldestchild. The mother's property should be equally divided among the otherchildren. Buston Hall should be the residence of the widow till theeldest son should be twenty-four, after which Mr. Prosper would no doubtfeel that their client would have to provide a home for herself. Messrs.Soames & Simpson did not think that there was anything in this to whichMr. Prosper would object, and if this were so, they would immediatelyprepare the settlement. "That woman didn't say against it, after all,"said Matthew to himself as he gave the letter from the lawyers to hismaster.The letter made Mr. Prosper very angry. It did, in truth, containnothing more than a repetition of the very terms which the lady hadherself suggested; but coming to him through these local lawyers it wasdoubly distasteful. What was he to do? He felt it to be out of thequestion to accede at once. Indeed, he had a strong repugnance toputting himself into communication with the Buntingford lawyers. Had thematter been other than it was, he would have gone to the rector foradvice. The rector generally advised him.But that was out of the question now. He had seen his sister once sincehis visit to Buntingford, but had said nothing to her about it. Indeed,he had been anything but communicative, so that Mrs. Annesley had beenforced to leave him with a feeling almost of offense. There was no helpto be had in that quarter, and he could only write to Mr. Grey, and askthat gentleman to assist him in his difficulties.He did write to Mr. Grey, begging for his immediate attention. "There isthat fool Prosper going to marry a brewer's daughter down atBuntingford," said Mr. Grey to his daughter."He's sixty years old.""No, my love. He looks it, but he's only fifty. A man at fifty issupposed to be young enough to marry. There's a nephew who has beenbrought up as his heir; that's the hard part of it. And the nephew ismixed up in some way with the Scarboroughs.""Is it he who is to marry that young lady?""I think it is. And now there's some devil's play going on. I've gotnothing to do with it.""But you will have.""Not a turn. Mr. Prosper can marry if he likes it. They have sent himmost abominable proposals as to the lady's money; and as to herjointure, I must stop that if I can, though I suppose he is not such afool as to give way.""Is he soft?""Well, not exactly. He likes his own money. But he's a gentleman, andwants nothing but what is or ought to be his own.""There are but few like that now.""It's true of him. But then he does not know what is his own, or whatought to be. He's almost the biggest fool I have ever known, and will doan injustice to that boy simply from ignorance." Then he drafted hisletter to Mr. Prosper, and gave it to Dolly to read. "That's what Ishall propose. The clerk can put it into proper language. He must offerless than he means to give.""Is that honest, father?""It's honest on my part, knowing the people with whom I have to deal. IfI were to lay down the strict minimum which he should grant, he wouldadd other things which would cause him to act not in accordance with myadvice. I have to make allowance for his folly,--a sort of windage, whichis not dishonest. Had he referred her lawyers to me I could have been ashard and honest as you please." All which did not quite satisfy Dolly'sstrict ideas of integrity.But the terms proposed were that the lady's means should be divided sothat one-half should go to herself for her own personal expenses, andthe other half to her husband for the use of the house; that the ladyshould put up with a jointure of two hundred and fifty pounds, whichought to suffice when joined to her own property, and that thesettlement among the children should be as recommended by Messrs. Soames& Simpson."And if there are not any children, papa?""Then each will receive his or her own property.""Because it may be so.""Certainly, my dear; very probably."CHAPTER XXVIII.MR. HARKAWAY.When the first Monday in November came Harry was still living at therectory. Indeed, what other home had he in which to live? Other friendshad become shy of him besides his uncle. He had been accustomed toreceive many invitations. Young men who are the heirs to properties, andare supposed to be rich because they are idle, do get themselves askedabout here and there, and think a great deal of themselves inconsequence. "There's young Jones. He is fairly good-looking, but hasn'ta word to say for himself. He will do to pair off with Miss Smith,who'll talk for a dozen. He can't hit a hay-stack, but he's none theworse for that. We haven't got too many pheasants. He'll be sure to comewhen you ask him,--and he'll be sure to go."So Jones is asked, and considers himself to be the most popular man inLondon. I will not say that Harry's invitations had been of exactly thatdescription; but he too had considered himself to be popular, and nowgreatly felt the withdrawal of such marks of friendship. He had receivedone "put off"--from the Ingoldsbys of Kent. Early in June he hadpromised to be there in November. The youngest Miss Ingoldsby was verypretty, and he, no doubt, had been gracious. She knew that he had meantnothing,--could have meant nothing. But he might come to mean something,and had been most pressingly asked. In September there came a letter tohim to say that the room intended for him at Ingoldsby had been burntdown. Mrs. Ingoldsby was so extremely sorry, and so were the "girls!"Harry could trace it all up. The Ingoldsbys knew the Greens, and Mrs.Green was Sister to Septimus Jones, who was absolutely the slave,--theslave, as Harry said, repeating the word to himself with emphasis,--ofAugustus Scarborough. He was very unhappy, not that he cared in theleast for any Miss Ingoldsby, but that he began to be conscious that hewas to be dropped.He was to be taken up, on the other hand, by Joshua Thoroughbung. Alas!alas! though he smiled and resolved to accept his brother-in-law with agood heart, this did not in the least salve the wound. His own countywas to him less than other counties, and his own neighborhood less thanother neighborhoods. Buntingford was full of Thoroughbungs, the bestpeople in the world, but not quite up to what he believed to be hismark. Mr. Prosper himself was the stupidest ass! At Welwyn peoplesmelled of the City. At Stevenage the parsons' set began. Baldock was a_caput mortuum_ of dulness. Royston was alive only on market-days. Ofhis own father's house, and even of his mother and sisters, heentertained ideas that savored a little of depreciation. But, to redeemhim from this fault,--a fault which would have led to the absolute ruinof his character had it not been redeemed and at last cured,--there was aconsciousness of his own vanity and weakness. "My father is worth adozen of them, and my mother and sisters two dozen," he would say of theIngoldsbys when he went to bed in the room that was to be burnt down inpreparation for his exile. And he believed it. They were honest; theywere unselfish; they were unpretending. His sister Molly was not aboveowning that her young brewer was all the world to her; a fine, honest,bouncing girl, who said her prayers with a meaning, thanked the Lord forgiving her Joshua, and laughed so loud that you could hear her out ofthe rectory garden half across the park. Harry knew that they weregood,--did in his heart know that where the parsons begin the good thingswere likely to begin also.He was in this state of mind, the hand of good pulling one way and thedevil's pride the other, when young Thoroughbung called for him onemorning to carry him on to Cumberlow Green. Cumberlow Green was apopular meet in that county, where meets have not much to make thempopular except the good-humor of those who form the hunt. It is not acounty either pleasant or easy to ride over, and a Puckeridge fox issurely the most ill-mannered of foxes. But the Puckeridge men aregracious to strangers, and fairly so among themselves. It is more thancan be said of Leicestershire, where sportsmen ride in brilliant bootsand breeches, but with their noses turned supernaturally into the air."Come along; we've four miles to do, and twenty minutes to do it in.Halloo, Molly, how d'ye do? Come up on to the step and give us a kiss.""Go away!" said Molly, rushing back into the house. "Did you ever hearanything like his impudence?""Why shouldn't you?" said Kate. "All the world knows it." Then the gig,with the two sportsmen, was driven on. "Don't you think he lookshandsome in his pink coat?" whispered Molly, afterward, to her eldersister. "Only think; I have never seen him in a red coat since he was myown. Last April, when the hunting was over, he hadn't spoken out; andthis is the first day he has worn pink this year."Harry, when he reached the meet, looked about him to watch how he wasreceived. There are not many more painful things in life than when anhonest, gallant young fellow has to look about him in such a frame ofmind. It might have been worse had he deserved to be dropped, some onewill say. Not at all. A different condition of mind exists then, and astruggle is made to overcome the judgment of men which is not in itselfpainful. It is part of the natural battle of life, which does not hurtone at all,--unless, indeed, the man hate himself for that which hasbrought upon him the hatred of others. Repentance is always anagony,--and should be so. Without the agony there can be no repentance.But even then it is hardly so sharp as that feeling of injustice whichaccompanies the unmeaning look, and dumb faces, and pretendedindifference of those who have condemned.When Harry descended from the gig he found himself close to old Mr.Harkaway, the master of the hounds. Mr. Harkaway was a gentleman who hadbeen master of these hounds for more than forty years, and had given asmuch satisfaction as the county could produce. His hounds, which werehis hobby, were perfect. His horses were good enough for theHertfordshire lanes and Hertfordshire hedges. His object was not so muchto run a fox as to kill him in obedience to certain rules of the game.Ever so many hinderances have been created to bar the killing a fox,--asfor instance that you shouldn't knock him on the head with abrick-bat,--all of which had to Mr. Harkaway the force of a religion. Thelaws of hunting are so many that most men who hunt cannot know them all.But no law had ever been written, or had become a law by the strength oftradition, which he did not know.To break them was to him treason. When a young man broke them he pitiedthe young man's ignorance, and endeavored to instruct him after somerough fashion. When an old man broke them, he regarded him as a fool whoshould stay at home, or as a traitor who should be dealt with as such.And with such men he could deal very hardly. Forty years of reigning hadtaught him to believe himself to be omnipotent, and he was so in his ownhunt. He was a man who had never much affected social habits. Thecompany of one or two brother sportsmen to drink a glass of port-winewith him and then to go early to bed, was the most of it. He had a smalllibrary, but not a book ever came off the shelf unless it referred tofarriers or the _res venatica_. He was unmarried. The time which othermen gave to their wives and families he bestowed upon his hounds. To hisstables he never went, looking on a horse as a necessary adjunct tohunting,--expensive, disagreeable, and prone to get you into danger. Whenanyone flattered him about his horse he would only grunt, and turn hishead on one side. No one in these latter years had seen him jump anyfence. But yet he was always with his hounds, and when any one said akind word as to their doings, that he would take as a compliment. It wasthey who were there to do the work of the day, which horses and mencould only look at. He was a sincere, honest, taciturn, and withal,affectionate man, who could on an occasion be very angry with those whooffended him. He knew well what he could do, and never attempted thatwhich was beyond his power. "How are you, Mr. Harkaway?" said Harry."How are you, Mr. Annesley? how are you?" said the master, with all thegrace of which he was capable. But Harry caught a tone in his voicewhich he thought implied displeasure. And Mr. Harkaway had in truthheard the story,--how Harry had been discarded at Buston because he hadknocked the man down in the streets at night-time and had then goneaway. After that Mr. Harkaway toddled off, and Harry sat and frownedwith embittered heart."Well, Malt-and-hops, and how are you?" This came from a fast youngbanker who lived in the neighborhood, and who thus intended to show hisfamiliarity with the brewer; but when he saw Annesley, he turned roundand rode away. "Scaly trick that fellow played the other day. He knockeda fellow down, and, when he thought that he was dead, he lied about itlike old boots." All of which made itself intelligible to Harry. He toldhimself that he had always hated that banker."Why do you let such a fellow as that call you Malt-and-hops?" he saidto Joshua."What,--young Florin? He's a very good fellow, and doesn't meananything.""A vulgar cad, I should say."Then he rode on in silence till he was addressed by an old gentleman ofthe county who had known his father for the last thirty years. The oldgentleman had had nothing about him to recommend him either to Harry'shatred or love till he spoke; and after that Harry hated him. "How d'youdo, Mr. Annesley?" said the old gentleman, and then rode on. Harry knewthat the old man had condemned him as the others had done, or he wouldnever have called him Mr. Annesley. He felt that he was "blown upon" inhis own county, as well as by the Ingoldsbys down in Kent.They had but a moderate day's sport, going a considerable distance insearch of it, till an incident arose which gave quite an interest to thefield generally, and nearly brought Joshua Thoroughbung into a scrape.They were drawing a covert which was undoubtedly the property of theirown hunt,--or rather just going to draw it,--when all of a sudden theybecame aware that every hound in the pack was hunting. Mr. Harkaway atonce sprung from his usual cold, apathetic manner into full action. Butthey who knew him well could see that it was not the excitement of joy.He was in an instant full of life, but it was not the life of successfulenterprise. He was perturbed and unhappy, and his huntsman, Dillon,--asilent, cunning, not very popular man, who would obey his master ineverything,--began to move about rapidly, and to be at his wit's end. Theyounger men prepared themselves for a run,--one of those sudden, short,decisive spurts which come at the spur of the moment, and on which aman, if he is not quite awake to the demands of the moment, is very aptto be left behind. But the old stagers had their eyes on Mr. Harkaway,and knew that there was something amiss.Then there appeared another field of hunters, first one man leadingthem, then others following, and after them the first ruck and then thecrowd. It was apparent to all who knew anything that two packs hadjoined. These were the Hitchiners, as the rival sportsmen would callthem, and this was the Hitchin Hunt, with Mr. Fairlawn, their master.Mr. Fairlawn was also an old man, popular, no doubt, in his own country,but by no means beloved by Mr. Harkaway. Mr. Harkaway used to declarehow Fairlawn had behaved very badly about certain common coverts aboutthirty years ago, when the matter had to be referred to a committee ofmasters. No one in these modern days knew aught of the quarrel, orcared. The men of the two hunts were very good friends, unless they metunder the joint eyes of the two masters, and then they were supposed tobe bound to hate each other. Now the two packs were mixed together, andthere was only one fox between them.The fox did not trouble them long. He could hardly have saved himselffrom one pack, but very soon escaped from the fangs of the two. Eachhound knew that his neighbor hound was a stranger, and, in scrutinizingthe singularity of the occurrence, lost all the power of hunting. In tenminutes there were nearly forty couples of hounds running hither andthither, with two huntsmen and four whips swearing at them with strangevoices, and two old gentlemen giving orders each in opposition to theother. Then each pack was got together, almost on the same ground, andit was necessary that something should be done. Mr. Harkaway waited tosee whether Mr. Fairlawn would ride away quickly to his own country. Hewould not have spoken to Mr. Fairlawn if he could have helped it. Mr.Fairlawn was some miles away from his country. He must have given up theday for lost had he simply gone away. But there was another covert amile off, and he thought that one of his hounds had "shown a line,"--orsaid that he thought so.Now, it is well known that you may follow a hunted fox through whatevercountry he may take you to, if only your hounds are hunting himcontinuously. And one hound for that purpose is as good as thirty, andif a hound can only "show a line" he is held to be hunting. Mr. Fairlawnwas quite sure that one of his hounds had been showing a line, and hadbeen whipped off it by one of Mr. Harkaway's men. The man swore that hehad only been collecting his own hounds. On this plea Mr. Fairlawndemanded to take his whole pack into Greasegate Wood,--the very covertthat Mr. Harkaway had been about to draw. "I'm d----d if you do!" said Mr.Harkaway, standing, whip in hand, in the middle of the road, so as toprevent the enemy's huntsman passing by with his hounds. It wasafterward declared that Mr. Harkaway had not been heard to curse andswear for the last fifteen years. "I'm d----d if I don't!" said Mr.Fairlawn, riding up to him. Mr. Harkaway was ten years the older man,and looked as though he had much less of fighting power. But no one sawhim quail or give an inch. Those who watched his face declared that hislips were white with rage and quivered with passion.To tell the words which passed between them after that would requireHomer's pathos and Homer's imagination. The two old men scowled andscolded at each other, and, had Mr. Fairlawn attempted to pass, Mr.Harkaway would certainly have struck him with his whip. And behind theirmaster a crowd of the Puckeridge men collected themselves,--foremostamong whom was Joshua Thoroughbung. "Take 'em round to the covert byWinnipeg Lane," said Mr. Fairlawn to his huntsman. The man prepared totake his pack round by Winnipeg Lane, which would have added a mile tothe distance. But the huntsman, when he had got a little to the left,was soon seen scurrying across the country in the direction of thecovert, with a dozen others at his heels, and the hounds following him.But old Mr. Harkaway had seen it too, and having possession of the road,galloped along it at such a pace that no one could pass him.All the field declared that they had regarded it as impossible thattheir master should move so fast. And Dillon, and the whips, andThoroughbung, and Harry Annesley, with half a dozen others, kept pacewith him. They would not sit there and see their master outmanoeuvred byany lack of readiness on their part. They got to the covert first, andthere, with their whips drawn, were ready to receive the second pack.Then one hound went in without an order; but for their own hounds theydid not care. They might find a fox and go after him, and nobody wouldfollow them. The business here at the covert-side was more important andmore attractive.Then it was that Mr. Thoroughbung nearly fell into danger. As to theother hounds,--Mr. Fairlawn's hounds,--doing any harm in the covert, ordoing any good for themselves or their owners, that was out of thequestion. The rival pack was already there, with their noses up in theair, and thinking of anything but a fox; and this other pack,--theHitchiners,--were just as wild. But it was the object of Mr. Fairlawn'sbody-guard to say that they had drawn the covert in the teeth of Mr.Harkaway, and to achieve this one of the whips thought that he couldride through the Puckeridge men, taking a couple of hounds with him.That would suffice for triumph.But to prevent such triumph on the part of the enemy Joshua Thoroughbungwas prepared to sacrifice himself. He rode right at the whip, with hisown whip raised, and would undoubtedly have ridden over him had not thewhip tried to turn his horse sharp round, stumbled and fallen in thestruggle, and had not Thoroughbung, with his horse, fallen over him.It will be the case that a slight danger or injury in one direction willoften stop a course of action calculated to create greater dangers andworse injuries. So it was in this case. When Dick, the Hitchin whip,went down, and Thoroughbung, with his horse, was over him,--two men andtwo horses struggling together on the ground,--all desire to carry on thefight was over.The huntsman came up, and at last Mr. Fairlawn also, and considered itto be their duty to pick up Dick, whose breath was knocked out of him bythe weight of Joshua Thoroughbung, and the Puckeridge side felt it to benecessary to give their aid to the valiant brewer. There was then nomore attempt to draw the covert. Each general in gloomy silence took offhis forces, and each afterward deemed that the victory was his. Dickswore, when brought to himself, that one of his hounds had gone in,whereas Squire 'Arkaway "had swore most 'orrid oaths that no 'Itchiner'ound should ever live to put his nose in. One of 'is 'ounds 'ad, andSquire 'Arkaway would have to be--" Well, Dick declared that he wouldnot say what would happen to Mr. Harkaway.CHAPTER XXIX.RIDING HOME.The two old gentlemen rode away, each in his own direction, in gloomysilence. Not a word was said by either of them, even to one of his ownfollowers. It was nearly twenty miles to Mr. Harkaway's house, and alongthe entire twenty miles he rode silent. "He's in an awful passion," saidThoroughbung; "he can't speak from anger." But, to tell the truth, Mr.Harkaway was ashamed of himself. He was an old gentleman, betweenseventy and eighty, who was supposed to go out for his amusement, andhad allowed himself to be betrayed into most unseemly language. Whatthough the hound had not "shown a line?" Was it necessary that he, athis time of life, should fight on the road for the maintenance of atrifling right of sport. But yet there came upon him from time to time asense of the deep injury done to him. That man Fairlawn, thatblackguard, that creature of all others the farthest removed from agentleman, had declared that in his, Mr. Harkaway's teeth, he would drawhis, Mr. Harkaway's covert! Then he would urge on his old horse, andgnash his teeth; and then, again, he would be ashamed. "Tantaene animiscoelestibus irae?"But Thoroughbung rode home high in spirits, very proud, and conscious ofhaving done good work. He was always anxious to stand well with the huntgenerally, and was aware that he had now distinguished himself. HarryAnnesley was on one side of him, and on the other rode Mr. Florin, thebanker. "He's an abominable liar!" said Thoroughbung, "a wicked,wretched liar!" He was alluding to the Hitchiner's whip, whom in hiswrath he had nearly sent to another world. "He says that one of hishounds got into the covert, but I was there and saw it all. Not a nosewas over the little bank which runs between the field and the covert.""You must have seen a hound if he had been there," said the banker."I was as cool as a cucumber, and could count the hounds he had withhim. There were three of them. A big black-spotted bitch was leading,the one that I nearly fell upon. When the man went down the houndstopped, not knowing what was expected of him. How should he? The manwould have been in the covert, but, by George! I managed to stop him.""What did you mean to do to him when you rode at him so furiously?"asked Harry."Not let him get in there. That was my resolute purpose. I suppose Ishould have knocked him off his horse with my whip.""But suppose he had knocked you off your horse?" suggested the banker."There is no knowing how that might have been. I never calculated thosechances. When a man wants to do a thing like that he generally does it.""And you did it?" said Harry."Yes; I think I did. I dare say his bones are sore. I know mine are. ButI don't care for that in the least. When this day comes to be talkedabout, as I dare say it will be for many a long year, no one will beable to say that the Hitchiners got into that covert." Thoroughbung,with the genuine modesty of an Englishman, would not say that he hadachieved by his own prowess all this glory for the Puckeridge Hunt, buthe felt it down to the very end of his nails.Had he not been there that whip would have got into the wood, and a verydifferent tale would then have been told in those coming years to whichhis mind was running away with happy thoughts. He had ridden theaggressors down; he had stopped the first intrusive hound. But though hecontinued to talk of the subject, he did not boast in so many words thathe had done it. His "veni, vidi, vici," was confined to his own bosom.As they rode home together there came to be a little crowd of men roundThoroughbung, giving him the praises that were his due. But one by onethey fell off from Annesley's side of the road. He soon felt that no oneaddressed a word to him. He was, probably, too prone to encourage themin this. It was he that fell away, and courted loneliness, and then inhis heart accused them. There was no doubt something of truth in hisaccusations; but another man, less sensitive, might have lived it down.He did more than meet their coldness half-way, and then complained tohimself of the bitterness of the world. "They are like the beasts of thefield," he said, "who when another beast has been wounded, turn upon himand rend him to death." His future brother-in-law, the best naturedfellow that ever was born, rode on thoughtless, and left Harry alone forthree or four miles, while he received the pleasant plaudits of hiscompanions. In Joshua's heart was that tale of the whip's discomfiture.He did not see that Molly's brother was alone as soon as he would havedone but for his own glory. "He is the same as the others," said Harryto himself. "Because that man has told a falsehood of me, and has hadthe wit to surround it with circumstances, he thinks it becomes him toride away and cut me." Then he asked himself some foolish questions asto himself and as to Joshua Thoroughbung, which he did not answer as heshould have done, had he remembered that he was then ridingThoroughbung's horse, and that his sister was to become Thoroughbung'swife.After half an hour of triumphant ovation, Joshua remembered hisbrother-in-law, and did fall back so as to pick him up. "What's thematter, Harry? Why don't you come on and join us?""I'm sick of hearing of that infernal squabble.""Well; as to a squabble, Mr. Harkaway behaved quite right. If a hunt isto be kept up, the right of entering coverts must be preserved for thehunt they belong to. There was no line shown. You must remember thatthere isn't a doubt about that. The hounds were all astray when wejoined them. It's a great question whether they brought their fox intothat first covert. There are they who think that Bodkin was just ridingacross the Puckeridge country in search of a fox." Bodkin was Mr.Fairlawn's huntsman. "If you admit that kind of thing, where will yoube? As a hunting country, just nowhere. Then as a sportsman, where areyou? It is necessary to put down such gross fraud. My own impression isthat Mr. Fairlawn should be turned out from being master. I own I feelvery strongly about it. But then I always have been fond of hunting.""Just so," said Harry, sulkily, who was not in the least interested asto the matter on which Joshua was so eloquent.Then Mr. Proctor rode by, the gentleman who in the early part of the daydisgusted Harry by calling him "mister." "Now, Mr. Proctor," continuedJoshua, "I appeal to you whether Mr. Harkaway was not quite right? Ifyou won't stick up for your rights in a hunting county--" But Mr.Proctor rode on, wishing them good-night, very discourteously decliningto hear the remainder of the brewer's arguments. "He's in a hurry, Isuppose," said Joshua."You'd better follow him. You'll find that he'll listen to you then.""I don't want him to listen to me particularly.""I thought you did." Then for half an hour the two men rode on insilence."What's the matter with you Harry?" said Joshua. "I can see there'ssomething up that riles you. I know you're a fellow of your college, andhave other things to think of besides the vagaries of a fox.""The fellow of a college!" said Harry, who, had he been in a good-humor,would have thought much more of being along with a lot of fox-huntersthan of any college honors."Well, yes; I suppose it is a great thing to be a fellow of a college. Inever could have been one if I had mugged forever.""My being a fellow of a college won't do me much good. Did you see thatold man Proctor go by just now?""Oh yes; he never likes to be out after a certain hour.""And did you see Florin, and Mr. Harkaway, and a lot of others? Youyourself have been going on ahead for the last hour without speaking tome.""How do you mean without speaking to you?" said Joshua, turning sharpround.Then Harry Annesley reflected that he was doing an injustice to hisfuture brother-in-law."Perhaps I have done you wrong," he said."You have.""I beg your pardon. I believe you are as honest and true a fellow asthere is in Hertfordshire, but for those others--""You think it's about Mountjoy Scarborough, then?" asked Joshua."I do. That infernal fool, Peter Prosper, has chosen to publish to theworld that he has dropped me because of something that he has heard ofthat occurrence. A wretched lie has been told with a purpose byMountjoy Scarborough's brother, and my uncle has taken it into his wisehead to believe it. The truth is, I have not been as respectful to himas he thinks I ought, and now he resents my neglect in this fashion. Heis going to marry your aunt in order that he may have a lot of children,and cut me out. In order to justify himself, he has told these liesabout me, and you see the consequence;--not a man in the county iswilling to speak to me.""I really think a great deal of it's fancy.""You go and ask Mr. Harkaway. He's honest, and he'll tell you. Ask thisnew cousin of yours, Mr. Prosper.""I don't know that they are going to make a match of it, after all.""Ask my own father. Only think of it,--that a puling, puking idiot likethat, from a mere freak, should be able to do a man such a mischief! Hecan rob me of my income, which he himself has brought me up to expect.That he can do by a stroke of his pen. He can threaten to have sons likePriam. All that is within his own bosom. But to justify himself to theworld at large, he picks up a scandalous story from a man like AugustusScarborough, and immediately not a man in the county will speak to me. Isay that that is enough to break a man's heart,--not the injury donewhich a man should bear, but the injustice of the doing. Who wants hisbeggarly allowance! He can do as he likes about his own money. I shallnever ask him for his money. But that he should tell such a lie as thisabout the county is more than a man can endure.""What was it that did happen?" asked Joshua."The man met me in the street when he was drunk, and he struck at me andwas insolent. Of course I knocked him down. Who wouldn't have done thesame? Then his brother found him somewhere, or got hold of him, and senthim out of the country, and says that I had held my tongue when I lefthim in the street. Of course I held my tongue. What was Mountjoy to me?Then Augustus has asked me sly questions, and accuses me of lyingbecause I did not choose to tell him everything. It all comes out ofthat."Here they had reached the rectory, and Harry, after seeing that thehorses were properly supplied with gruel, took himself and his ill-humorup-stairs to his own chamber. But Joshua had a word or two to say to oneof the inmates of the rectory.He felt that it would be improper to ride his horse home without givingtime to the animal to drink his gruel, and therefore made his way intothe little breakfast-parlor, where Molly had a cup of tea and butteredtoast ready for him. He of course told her first of the grand occurrenceof the day,--how the two packs of hounds had mixed themselves together,how violently the two masters had fallen out and had nearly flogged eachother, how Mr. Harkaway had sworn horribly,--who had never been heard toswear before,--how a final attempt had been made to seize a secondcovert, and how, at last, it had come to pass that he had distinguishedhimself. "Do you mean to say that you absolutely rode over theunfortunate man?" asked Molly."I did. Not that the man had the worst of it,--or very much the worse.There we were both down, and the two horses, all in a heap together.""Oh, Joshua, suppose you had been kicked!""In that case I should have been--kicked.""But a kick from an infuriated horse!""There wasn't much infuriation about him. The man had ridden all thatout of the beast.""You are sure to laugh at me, Joshua, because I think what terriblethings might have happened to you. Why do you go putting yourself soforward in every danger, now that you have got somebody else to dependupon you and to care for you? It's very, very wrong.""Somebody had to do it, Molly. It was most important, in the interestsof hunting generally, that those hounds should not have been allowed toget into that covert. I don't think that outsiders ever understand howessential it is to maintain your rights. It isn't as though it were anindividual. The whole county may depend upon it.""Why shouldn't it be some man who hasn't got a young woman to lookafter?" said Molly, half laughing and half crying."It's the man who first gets there who ought to do it," said Joshua. "Aman can't stop to remember whether he has got a young woman or not.""I don't think you ever want to remember." Then that little quarrel wasbrought to the usual end with the usual blandishments, and Joshua wenton to discuss with her that other source of trouble, her brother's fall."Harry is awfully cut up," said the brewer."You mean these affairs about his uncle?""Yes. It isn't only the money he feels, or the property, but peoplelook askew at him. You ought all of you to be very kind to him.""I am sure we are.""There is something in it to vex him. That stupid old fool, youruncle--I beg your pardon, you know, for speaking of him in that way--""He is a stupid old fool.""Is behaving very badly. I don't know whether he shouldn't be treated asI did that fellow up at the covert.""Ride over him?""Something of that kind. Of course Harry is sore about it, and when aman is sore he frets at a thing like that more than he ought to do. Asfor that aunt of mine at Buntingford, there seems to be some hitch init. I should have said she'd have married the Old Gentleman had he askedher.""Don't talk like that, Joshua.""But there is some screw loose. Simpson came up to my father about ityesterday, and the governor let enough of the cat out of the bag to makeme know that the thing is not going as straight as she wishes.""He has offered, then?""I am sure he has asked her.""And your aunt will accept him?" asked Molly."There's probably some difference about money. It's all done with theintention of injuring poor Harry. If he were my own brother I could notbe more unhappy about him. And as to Aunt Matilda, she's a fool. Thereare two fools together. If they choose to marry we can't hinder them.But there is some screw loose, and if the two young lovers don't knowtheir own minds things may come right at last." Then, with some fartherblandishments, the prosperous brewer walked away.CHAPTER XXX.PERSECUTION.In the mean time Florence Mountjoy was not passing her time pleasantlyat Brussels. Various troubles there attended her. All her friends aroundher were opposed to her marriage with Harry Annesley. Harry Annesley hadbecome a very unsavory word in the mouths of Sir Magnus and the BritishEmbassy generally. Mrs. Mountjoy told her grief to her brother-in-law,who thoroughly took her part, as did also, very strongly, Lady Mountjoy.It got to be generally understood that Harry was a _mauvais sujet_. Suchwas the name that was attached to him, and the belief so conveyed wasthoroughly entertained by them all. Sir Magnus had written to friends inLondon, and the friends in London bore out the reports that were soconveyed. The story of the midnight quarrel was told in a manner veryprejudicial to poor Harry, and both Sir Magnus and his wife saw thenecessity of preserving their niece from anything so evil as such amarriage. But Florence was very firm, and was considered to be veryobstinate. To her mother she was obstinate but affectionate To SirMagnus she was obstinate and in some degree respectful. But to LadyMountjoy she was neither affectionate nor respectful. She took a greatdislike to Lady Mountjoy, who endeavored to domineer; and who, by theassistance of the two others, was in fact tyrannical. It was her opinionthat the girl should be compelled to abandon the man, and Mrs. Mountjoyfound herself constrained to follow this advice. She did love herdaughter, who was her only child. The main interest of her life wascentred in her daughter. Her only remaining ambition rested on herdaughter's marriage. She had long revelled in the anticipation of beingthe mother-in-law of the owner of Tretton Park. She had been very proudof her daughter's beauty.Then had come the first blow, when Harry Annesley had come to MontpelierPlace and had been welcomed by Florence. Mrs. Mountjoy had seen it alllong before Florence had been aware of it. And the first coming of Harryhad been long before the absolute disgrace of Captain Scarborough,--atany rate, before the tidings of that disgrace had reached Cheltenham.Mrs. Mountjoy had been still able to dream of Tretton Park, after theJews had got their fingers on it,--even after the Jews had been forced torelinquish their hold. It can hardly be said that up to this very timeMrs. Mountjoy had lost all hope in her nephew, thinking that as theproperty had been entailed some portion of it must ultimately belong tohim. She had heard that Augustus was to have it, and her desires hadvacillated between the two. Then Harry had positively declared himself,and Augustus had given her to understand how wretched, how mean, howwicked had been Harry's conduct. And he fully explained to her thatHarry would be penniless. She had indeed been aware that Buston,--quite atrifling thing compared to Tretton,--was to belong to him. But entailswere nothing nowadays. It was part of the radical abomination to whichEngland was being subjected. Not even Buston was now to belong to HarryAnnesley. The small income which he had received from his uncle wasstopped. He was reduced to live upon his fellowship,--which would bestopped also if he married. She even despised him because he was thefellow of a college;--she had looked for a husband for her daughter somuch higher than any college could produce. It was not from any lack ofmotherly love that she was opposed to Florence, or from any innatecruelty that she handed her daughter over to the tender mercies of LadyMountjoy.And since she had been at Brussels there had come up farther hopes.Another mode had shown itself of escaping Harry Annesley, who was of allcatastrophes the most dreaded and hated. Mr. Anderson, the secondsecretary of legation,--he whose business it was to ride about theboulevard with Sir Magnus,--had now declared himself in form. "Never sawa fellow so bowled over," Sir Magnus had declared, by which he hadintended to signify that Mr. Anderson was now truly in love. "I've seenhim spooney a dozen times," Sir Magnus had said, confidentially, to hissister-in-law, "but he has never gone to this length. He has asked a lotof girls to have him, but he has always been off it again before theweek was over. He has written to his mother now."And Mr. Anderson showed his love by very unmistakable signs. Sir Magnustoo, and Lady Mountjoy, were evidently on the same side as Mr. Anderson.Sir Magnus thought there was no longer any good in waiting for hisnephew, the captain, and of that other nephew, Augustus, he did notentertain any very high idea. Sir Magnus had corresponded lately withAugustus, and was certainly not on his side. But he so painted Mr.Anderson's prospects in life, as did also Lady Mountjoy, as to make itappear that if Florence could put up with young Anderson she would dovery well with herself."He's sure to be a baronet some of these days, you know," said SirMagnus."I don't think that would go very far with Florence," said her mother."But it ought. Look about in the world and you'll see that it does go along way. He'd be the fifth baronet.""But his elder brother is alive.""The queerest fellow you ever saw in your born days, and his life is notworth a year's purchase. He's got some infernal disease,--nostalgia, orwhat 'd'ye call it?--which never leaves him a moment's peace, and thenhe drinks nothing but milk. Sure to go off;--cock sure.""I shouldn't like Florence to count upon that.""And then Hugh Anderson, the fellow here, is very well off as it is. Hehas four hundred pounds here, and another five hundred pounds of hisown. Florence has, or will have, four hundred pounds of her own. Ishould call them deuced rich. I should, indeed, as beginners. She couldhave her pair of ponies here, and what more would she want?"These arguments did go very far with Mrs. Mountjoy, the farther becausein her estimation Sir Magnus was a great man. He was the greatestEnglishman, at any rate, in Brussels, and where should she go for advicebut to an Englishman? And she did not know that Sir Magnus had succeededin borrowing a considerable sum of money from his second secretary oflegation."Leave her to me for a little;--just leave her to me," said LadyMountjoy."I would not say anything hard to her," said the mother, pleading forher naughty child."Not too hard, but she must be made to understand. You see there havebeen misfortunes. As to Mountjoy Scarborough, he's past hoping for.""You think so?""Altogether. When a man has disappeared there's an end of him. There wasLord Baltiboy's younger son disappeared, and he turned out to be aZouave corporal in a French regiment. They did get him out, of course,but then he went preaching in America. You may take it for granted, thatwhen a man has absolutely vanished from the clubs, he'll never be anygood again as a marrying man.""But there's his brother, who, they say, is to have the property.""A very cold-blooded sort of young man, who doesn't care a straw for hisown family." He had received very sternly the overtures for a loan fromSir Magnus. "And he, as I understand, has never declared himself inFlorence's favor. You can't count upon Augustus Scarborough.""Not just count upon him.""Whereas there's young Anderson, who is the most gentleman-like youngman I know, all ready. It will have been such a turn of luck your cominghere and catching him up.""I don't know that it can be called a turn of luck. Florence has a verynice fortune of her own--""And she wants to give it to this penniless reprobate. It is just one ofthose cases in which you must deal roundly with a girl. She has to befrightened, and that's about the truth of it."After this, Lady Mountjoy did succeed in getting Florence alone withherself into her morning-room. When her mother told her that her auntwished to see her, she answered first that she had no special wish tosee her aunt. Her mother declared that in her aunt's house she was boundto go when her aunt sent for her. To this Florence demurred. She was,she thought, her aunt's guest, but by no means at her aunt's disposal.But at last she obeyed her mother. She had resolved that she would obeyher mother in all things but one, and therefore she went one morning toher aunt's chamber.But as she went she was, on the first instance, caught by her uncle, andtaken by him into a little private sanctum behind his official room. "Mydear," he said, "just come in here for two minutes.""I am on my way up to my aunt.""I know it, my dear. Lady Mountjoy has been talking it all over with me.Upon my word you can't do anything better than take young Anderson.""I can't do that, Uncle Magnus.""Why not? There's poor Mountjoy Scarborough, he has gone astray.""There is no question of my cousin.""And Augustus is no better.""There is no question of Augustus either.""As to that other chap, he isn't any good;--he isn't indeed.""You mean Mr. Annesley?""Yes; Harry Annesley, as you call him. He hasn't got a shilling to blesshimself with, or wouldn't have if he was to marry you.""But I have got something.""Not enough for both of you, I'm afraid. That uncle of his hasdisinherited him.""His uncle can't disinherit him.""He's quite young enough to marry and have a family, and then Annesleywill be disinherited. He has stopped his allowance, anyway, and youmustn't think of him. He did something uncommonly unhandsome the otherday, though I don't quite know what.""He did nothing unhandsome, Uncle Magnus.""Of course a young lady will stand up for her lover, but you willreally have to drop him. I'm not a hard sort of man, but this wassomething that the world will not stand. When he thought the man hadbeen murdered he didn't say anything about it for fear they should taxhim with it. And then he swore he had never seen him. It was somethingof that sort.""He never feared that any one would suspect him.""And now young Anderson has proposed. I should not have spoken else, butit's my duty to tell you about young Anderson. He's a gentleman allround.""So is Mr. Annesley.""And Anderson has got into no trouble at all. He does his duty hereuncommonly well. I never had less trouble with any young fellow than Ihave had with him. No licking him into shape,--or next to none,--and hehas a very nice private income. You together would have plenty, andcould live here till you had settled on apartments. A pair of ponieswould be just the thing for you to drive about and support the Britishinterests. You think of it, my dear, and you'll find that I'm right."Then Florence escaped from that room and went up to receive the muchmore severe lecture which she was to have from her aunt."Come in, my dear," said Lady Mountjoy, in her most austere voice. Shehad a voice which could assume austerity when she knew her power to bein the ascendant. As Florence entered the room Miss Abbott left it by adoor on the other side. "Take that chair, Florence. I want to have a fewminutes' conversation with you." Then Florence sat down. "When a younglady is thinking of being married, a great many things have to be takeninto consideration." This seemed to be so much a matter of fact thatFlorence did not feel it necessary to make any reply. "Of course I amaware you are thinking of being married.""Oh yes," said Florence."But to whom?""To Harry Annesley," said Florence, intending to imply that all theworld knew that."I hope not; I hope not. Indeed, I may say that it is quite out of thequestion. In the first place, he is a beggar.""He has begged from none," said Florence."He is what the world calls a beggar, when a young man without a pennythinks of being married.""I'm not a beggar, and what I've got will be his.""My dear, you're talking about what you don't understand. A young ladycannot give her money away in that manner; it will not be allowed.Neither your mother, nor Sir Magnus, nor will I permit it." HereFlorence restrained herself, but drew herself up in her chair as thoughprepared to speak out her mind if she should be driven. Lady Mountjoywould not permit it! She thought that she would feel herself quite ableto tell Lady Mountjoy that she had neither power nor influence in thematter, but she determined to be silent a little longer. "In the firstplace, a gentleman who is a gentleman never attempts to marry a lady forher money.""But when a lady has the money she can express herself much more clearlythan she could otherwise.""I don't quite understand what you mean by that, my dear.""When Mr. Annesley proposed to me he was the acknowledged heir to hisuncle's property.""A trumpery affair at the best of it.""It would have sufficed for me. Then I accepted him.""That goes for nothing from a lady. Of course your acceptance wascontingent on circumstances.""It was so;--on my regard. Having accepted him, and as my regard remainsjust as warm as ever, I certainly shall not go back because of anythinghis uncle may do. I only say this to explain that he was quite justifiedin his offer. It was not for my small fortune that he came to me.""I'm not so sure of that.""But if my money can be of any use to him, he's quite welcome to it. SirMagnus spoke to me about a pair of ponies. I'd rather have him than apair of ponies.""I'm coming to that just now. Here is Mr. Anderson.""Oh yes; he's here."There was certainly a touch of impatience in the tone in which this wasuttered. It was as though she had said that Mr. Anderson had socontrived that she could have no doubt whatever about his continuedpresence. Mr. Anderson had made himself so conspicuous as to be visibleto her constantly. Lady Mountjoy, who intended at present to sing Mr.Anderson's praises, felt this to be impertinent."I don't know what you mean by that. Mr. Anderson has behaved himselfquite like a gentleman, and you ought to be very proud of any token youmay receive of his regard and affection.""But I'm not bound to return to it.""You are bound to think of it when those who are responsible for youractions tell you to do so.""Mamma, you mean?""I mean your uncle, Sir Magnus Mountjoy." She did not quite dare to saythat she had meant herself. "I suppose you will admit that Sir Magnus isa competent judge of young men's characters?""He may be a judge of Mr. Anderson, because Mr. Anderson is his clerk."There was something of an intention to depreciate in the word "clerk."Florence had not thought much of Mr. Anderson's worth, nor, as far asshe had seen them, of the duties generally performed at the BritishEmbassy. She was ignorant of the peculiar little niceties andintricacies which required the residence at Brussels of a gentleman withall the tact possessed by Sir Magnus. She did not know that while themere international work of the office might be safely intrusted to Mr.Blow and Mr. Bunderdown, all those little niceties, that smiling andthat frowning, that taking off of hats and only half taking them off,that genial, easy manner, and that stiff hauteur, formed the peculiarbranch of Sir Magnus himself,--and, under Sir Magnus, of Mr. Anderson.She did not understand that even to that pair of ponies which waspromised to her were to be attached certain important functions, whichshe was to control as the deputy of the great man's deputy And now shehad called the great man's deputy a clerk!"Mr. Anderson is no such thing," said Lady Mountjoy."His young man, then,--or private secretary;--only somebody else isthat.""You are very impertinent and very ungrateful. Mr. Anderson is secondsecretary of legation. There is no officer attached to our establishmentof more importance. I believe you say it on purpose to anger me. Andthen you compare this gentleman to Mr. Annesley, a man to whom no onewill speak.""I will speak to him." Had Harry heard her say that, he ought to havebeen a happy man in spite of his trouble."You! What good can you do him?" Florence nodded her head, almostimperceptibly, but still there was a nod, signifying more than she couldpossibly say. She thought that she could do him a world of good if shewere near him, and some good, too, though she were far away. If she werewith him she could hang on to his arm,--or perhaps at some future timeround his neck,--and tell him that she would be true to him though allothers might turn away. And she could be just as true where she was,though she could not comfort him by telling him so with her own words.Then it was that she resolved upon writing that letter. He shouldalready have what little comfort she might administer in his absence."Now, listen to me, Florence. He is a thorough reprobate.""I will not hear him so called. He is no reprobate.""He has behaved in such a way that all England is crying out about him.He has done that which will never allow any gentleman to speak to himagain.""Then there will be more need that a lady should do so. But it is nottrue.""You put your knowledge of character against that of Sir Magnus.""Sir Magnus does not know the gentleman; I do. What's the good oftalking of it, aunt? Harry Annesley has my word, and nothing on earthshall induce me to go back from it. Even were he what you say I would betrue to him.""You would?""Certainly I would. I could not willingly begin to love a man whom Iknew to be base; but when I had loved him I would not turn because ofhis baseness;--I couldn't do it. It would be a great--a terriblemisfortune; but it would have to be borne. But here--I know all thestory to which you allude.""I know it too.""I am quite sure that the baseness has not been on his part. In defenceof my name he has been silent. He might have spoken out, if he had knownall the truth then. I was as much his own then as I am now. One of thesedays I suppose I shall be more so.""You mean to marry him, then?""Most certainly I do, or I will never be married; and as he is poor now,and I must have my own money when I am twenty-four, I suppose I shallhave to wait till then.""Will your mother's word go for nothing with you?""Poor mamma! I do believe that mamma is very unhappy, because she makesme unhappy. What may take place between me and mamma I am not bound, Ithink, to tell you. We shall be away soon, and I shall be left to mammaalone."And mamma would be left alone to her daughter, Lady Mountjoy thought.The visit must be prolonged so that at last Mr. Anderson might beenabled to prevail.The visit had been originally intended for a month, but was nowprolonged indefinitely. After that conversation between Lady Mountjoyand her niece two or three things happened, all bearing upon our story.Florence at once wrote her letter. If things were going badly in Englandwith Harry Annesley, Harry should at any rate have the comfort ofknowing what were her feelings,--if there might be comfort to him inthat. "Perhaps, after all, he won't mind what I may say," she thought toherself; but only pretended to think it, and at once flatly contradictedher own "perhaps." Then she told him most emphatically not to reply. Itwas very important that she should write. He was to receive her letter,and there must be an end of it. She was quite sure that he wouldunderstand her. He would not subject her to the trouble of having totell her own people that she was maintaining a correspondence, for itwould amount to that. But still when the time came for the answer shehad counted it up to the hour. And when Sir Magnus sent for her andhanded to her the letter,--having discussed that question with hermother,--she fully expected it, and felt properly grateful to her uncle.She wanted a little comfort, too, and when she had read the letter sheknew that she had received it.There had been a few words spoken between the two elder ladies after theinterview between Florence and Lady Mountjoy. "She is a most self-willedyoung woman," said Lady Mountjoy."Of course she loves her lover," said Mrs. Mountjoy, desirous of makingsome excuse for her own daughter. The girl was very troublesome, but notthe less her daughter. "I don't know any of them that don't who areworth anything.""If you regard it in that light, Sarah, she'll get the better of you. Ifshe marries him she will be lost; that is the way you have got to lookat it. It is her future happiness you must think of--and respectability.She is a headstrong young woman, and has to be treated accordingly.""What would you do?""I would be very severe.""But what am I to do? I can't beat her; I can't lock her up in herroom.""Then you mean to give it up?""No, I don't. You shouldn't be so cross to me," said poor Mrs. Mountjoy.When it had reached this the two ladies had become intimate. "I don'tmean to give it up at all; but what am I to do?""Remain here for the next month, and--and worry her; let Mr. Andersonhave his chance with her. When she finds that everything will smilewith her if she accepts him, and that her life will be made a burden toher if she still sticks to her Harry Annesley, she'll come round, if shebe like other girls. Of course a girl can't be made to marry a man, butthere are ways and means." By this Lady Mountjoy meant that the utmostcruelty should be used which would be compatible with a good breakfast,dinner, and bedroom. Now, Mrs. Mountjoy knew herself to be incapable ofthis, and knew also, or thought that she knew, that it would not beefficacious."You stay here,--up to Christmas, if you like it," said Sir Magnus to hissister-in-law. "She can't but see Anderson every day, and that goes along way. She, of course, puts on a resolute air as well as she can.They all know how to do that. Do you be resolute in return. The deuce isin it if we can't have our way with her among us. When you talk of illusage nobody wants you to put her in chains. There are different ways ofkilling a cat. You get friends to write to you from England about youngAnnesley, and I'll do the same. The truth, of course, I mean.""Nothing can be worse than the truth," said Mrs. Mountjoy, shaking herhead, sorrowfully."Just so," said Sir Magnus, who was not at all sorrowful to hear so badan account of the favored suitor. "Then we'll read her the letters. Shecan't help hearing them. Just the true facts, you know. That's fair;nobody can call that cruel. And then, when she breaks down and comes toour call, we'll all be as soft as mother's milk to her. I shall see hergoing about the boulevards with a pair of ponies yet." Mrs. Mountjoyfelt that when Sir Magnus spoke of Florence coming to his call he didnot know her daughter. But she had nothing better to do than to obey SirMagnus. Therefore she resolved to stay at Brussels another period of sixweeks and told Florence that she had so resolved. Just at presentBrussels and Cheltenham would be all the same to Florence."It will be a dreadful bore having them so long," said poor LadyMountjoy, piteously, to her husband. For in the presence of Sir Magnusshe was by no means the valiant woman that she was with some of herfriends."You find everything a bore. What's the trouble?""What am I to do with them?""Take 'em about in the carriage. Lord bless my soul! what have you got acarriage for?""Then, with Miss Abbott, there's never room for any one else.""Leave Miss Abbott at home, then. What's the good of talking to me aboutMiss Abbott? I suppose it doesn't matter to you whom my brother'sdaughter marries?" Lady Mountjoy did not think that it did matter much;but she declared that she had already evinced the most tendersolicitude. "Then stick to it. The girl doesn't want to go out everyday. Leave her alone, where Anderson can get at her.""He's always out riding with you.""No, he's not; not always. And leave Miss Abbott at home. Then there'llbe room for two others. Don't make difficulties. Anderson will expectthat I shall do something for him, of course.""Because of the money," said Lady Mountjoy, whispering."And I've got to do something for her too." Now, there was a spice ofhonesty about Sir Magnus. He knew that as he could not at once pay backthese sums, he was bound to make it up in some other way. The debtswould be left the same. But that would remain with Providence.Then came Harry's letter, and there was a deep consultation. It wasknown to have come from Harry by the Buntingford post-mark. Mrs.Mountjoy proposed to consult Lady Mountjoy; but to that Sir Magnus wouldnot agree. "She'd take her skin off her if she could, now that she'sangered," said the lady's husband, who no doubt knew the lady well. "Ofcourse she'll learn that the letter has been written, and then she'llthrow it in our teeth. She wouldn't believe that it had gone astray incoming here. We should give her a sort of a whip-hand over us." So itwas decided that Florence should have her letter.CHAPTER XXXI.FLORENCE'S REQUEST.Thus it was arranged that Florence should be left in Mr. Anderson's way.Mr. Anderson, as Sir Magnus had said, was not always out riding. Therewere moments in which even he was off duty. And Sir Magnus contrived toride a little earlier than usual so that he should get back while thecarriage was still out on its rounds. Lady Mountjoy certainly did herduty, taking Mrs. Mountjoy with her daily, and generally Miss Abbott, sothat Florence was, as it were, left to the mercies of Mr. Anderson. Shecould, of course, shut herself up in her bedroom, but things had not asyet become so bad as that. Mr. Anderson had not made himself terrible toher. She did not, in truth, fear Mr. Anderson at all, who was courteousin his manner and complimentary in his language, and she came at thistime to the conclusion that if Mr. Anderson continued his pursuit of hershe would tell him the exact truth of the case. As a gentleman, and as ayoung man, she thought that he would sympathize with her. The one enemywhom she did dread was Lady Mountjoy. She too had felt that her auntcould "take her skin off her," as Sir Magnus had said. She had not heardthe words, but she knew that it was so, and her dislike to Lady Mountjoywas in proportion. It cannot be said that she was afraid. She did notintend to leave her skin in her aunt's hands. For every inch of skintaken she resolved to have an inch in return. She was not acquaintedwith the expressive mode of language which Sir Magnus had adopted, butshe was prepared for all such attacks. For Sir Magnus himself, since hehad given up the letter to her, she did feel some regard.Behind the British minister's house, which, though entitled to no suchname, was generally called the Embassy, there was a large garden, which,though not much used by Sir Magnus or Lady Mountjoy, was regarded as avaluable adjunct to the establishment. Here Florence betook herself forexercise, and here Mr. Anderson, having put off the muddy marks of hisriding, found her one afternoon. It must be understood that no young manwas ever more in earnest than Mr. Anderson. He, too, looking through theglass which had been prepared for him by Sir Magnus, thought that he sawin the not very far distant future a Mrs. Hugh Anderson driving a pairof gray ponies along the boulevard and he was much pleased with thesight. It reached to the top of his ambition. Florence was to his eyesreally the sort of a girl whom a man in his position ought to marry. Asecretary of legation in a small foreign capital cannot do with a dowdywife, as may a clerk, for instance, in the Foreign Office. A secretaryof legation,--the second secretary, he told himself,--was bound, if hemarried at all, to have a pretty and _distinguee_ wife. He knew allabout the intricacies which had fallen in a peculiar way into his ownhand. Mr. Blow might have married a South Sea Islander, and would havebeen none the worse as regarded his official duties. Mr. Blow did notwant the services of a wife in discovering and reporting all the secretsof the Belgium iron trade. There was no intricacy in that, no nicety.There was much of what, in his lighter moments, Mr. Anderson called"sweat." He did not pretend to much capacity for such duties; but in hisown peculiar walk he thought that he was great. But it was veryfatiguing, and he was sure that a wife was necessary to him. There werelittle niceties which none but a wife could perform. He had a greatesteem for Sir Magnus. Sir Magnus was well thought of by all the court,and by the foreign minister at Brussels. But Lady Mountjoy was really ofno use. The beginning and the end of it all with her was to show herselfin a carriage. It was incumbent upon him, Anderson, to marry.He was loving enough, and very susceptible. He was too susceptible, andhe knew his own fault, and he was always on guard against it,--asbehooved a young man with such duties as his. He was always falling inlove, and then using his diplomatic skill in avoiding the consequences.He had found out that though one girl had looked so well under waxlightshe did not endure the wear and tear of the day. Another could not bealways graceful, or, though she could talk well enough during a waltz,she had nothing to say for herself at three o'clock in the morning. Andhe was driven to calculate that he would be wrong to marry a girlwithout a shilling. "It is a kind of thing that a man cannot afford todo unless he's sure of his position," he had said on such an occasion toMontgomery Arbuthnot, alluding especially to his brother's state ofhealth. When Mr. Anderson spoke of not being sure of his position he wasalways considered to allude to his brother's health. In this way he hadnearly got his little boat on to the rocks more than once, and had givensome trouble to Sir Magnus. But now he was quite sure. "It's all thereall round," he had said to Arbuthnot more than once. Arbuthnot said thatit was there--"all round, all round." Waxlight and daylight made nodifference to her. She was always graceful. "Nobody with an eye in hishead can doubt that," said Anderson. "I should think not, by Jove!"replied Arbuthnot. "And for talking,--you never catch her out; never." "Inever did, certainly," said Arbuthnot, who, as third secretary, wasobedient and kind-hearted. "And then look at her money. Of course afellow wants something to help him on. My position is so uncertain thatI cannot do without it." "Of course not." "Now, with some girls it's sodeuced hard to find out. You hear that a girl has got money, but whenthe time comes it depends on the life of a father who doesn't think ofdying;--damme, doesn't think of it.""Those fellows never do," said Arbuthnot. "But here, you see, I know allabout it. When she's twenty-four,--only twenty-four,--she'll have tenthousand pounds of her own. I hate a mercenary fellow." "Oh yes; that'sbeastly." "Nobody can say that of me. Circumstanced as I am, I wantsomething to help to keep the pot boiling. She has got it,--quite as muchas I want,--quite, and I know all about it without the slightest doubt inthe world." For the small loan of fifteen hundred pounds Sir Magnus paidthe full value of the interest and deficient security. "Sir Magnus tellsme that if I'll only stick to her I shall be sure to win. There's somefellow in England has just touched her heart,--just touched it, youknow." "I understand," said Arbuthnot, looking very wise. "He is not afellow of very much account," said Anderson; "one of those handsomefellows without conduct and without courage." "I've known lots of 'em,"said Arbuthnot. "His name is Annesley," said Anderson. "I never saw himin my life, but that's what Sir Magnus says. He has done somethingawfully disreputable. I don't quite understand what it is, but it'ssomething which ought to make him unfit to be her husband. Nobody knowsthe world better than Sir Magnus, and he says that it is so." "Nobodydoes know the world better than Sir Magnus," said Arbuthnot. And so thatconversation was brought to an end.One day soon after this he caught her walking in the garden. Her motherand Miss Abbot were still out with Lady Mountjoy in the carriage, andSir Magnus had retired after the fatigue of his ride to sleep for halfan hour before dinner. "All alone, Miss Mountjoy?" he said."Yes, alone, Mr. Anderson. I'm never in better company.""So I think; but then if I were here you wouldn't be all alone, wouldyou?""Not if you were with me.""That's what I mean. But yet two people may be alone, as regards theworld at large. Mayn't they?""I don't understand the nicety of language well enough to say. We usedto have a question among us when we were children whether a wild beastcould howl in an empty cavern. It's the same sort of thing.""Why shouldn't he?""Because the cavern would not be empty if the wild beast were in it.Did you ever see a girl bang an egg against a wall in a stocking, andthen look awfully surprised because she had smashed it?""I don't understand the joke.""She had been told she couldn't break an egg in an empty stocking. Thenshe was made to look in, and there was the broken egg for her pains. Idon't know what made me tell you that story.""It's a very good story. I'll get Miss Abbott to do it to-night. Shebelieves everything.""And everybody? Then she's a happy woman.""I wish you'd believe everybody.""So I do;--nearly everybody. There are some inveterate liars whom nobodycan believe.""I hope I am not regarded as one.""You? certainly not. If anybody were to speak of you as such behind yourback no one would take your part more loyally than I. But nobody would.""That's something, at any rate. Then you do believe that I love you?""I believe that you think so.""And that I don't know my own heart?""That's very common, Mr. Anderson. I wasn't quite sure of my own hearttwelve months ago, but I know it now." He felt that his hopes ran verylow when this was said. She had never before spoken to him of his rival,nor had he to her. He knew, or fancied that he knew, that "her heart hadbeen touched," as he had said to Arbuthnot. But the "touch" must havebeen very deep if she felt herself constrained to speak to him on thesubject. It had been his desire to pass over Mr. Annesley, and never tohear the name mentioned between them. "You were speaking of your ownheart.""Well I was, no doubt. It is a silly thing to talk of, I dare say.""I'm going to tell you of my heart, and I hope you won't think it silly.I do so because I believe you to be a gentleman, and a man of honor." Heblushed at the words and the tone in which they were spoken, but hisheart fell still lower. "Mr. Anderson, I am engaged." Here she paused amoment, but he had nothing to say. "I am engaged to marry a gentlemanwhom I love with all my heart, and all my strength, and all my body. Ilove him so that nothing can ever separate me from him, or, at least,from the thoughts of him. As regards all the interests of life, I feelas though I were already his wife. If I ever marry any man I swear toyou that it will be him." Then Mr. Anderson felt that all hope hadutterly departed from him. She had said that she believed him to be aman of truth. He certainly believed her to be a true-speaking woman. Heasked himself, and he found it to be quite impossible to doubt her wordon this subject. "Now I will go on and tell you my troubles. My motherdisapproves of the man. Sir Magnus has taken upon himself to disapprove,and Lady Mountjoy disapproves especially. I don't care two straws aboutSir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy. As to Lady Mountjoy, it is simply animpertinence on her part, interfering with me." There was something inher face as she said this which made Mr. Anderson feel that if he couldonly succeed in having her and the pair of ponies he would be a prouderman than the ambassador at Paris. But he knew that it was hopeless. "Asto my mother, that is indeed a sorrow. She has been to me the dearestmother, putting her only hopes of happiness in me. No mother was evermore devoted to a child, and of all children I should be the mostungrateful were I to turn against her. But from my early years she haswished me to marry a man whom I could not bring myself to love. You haveheard of Captain Scarborough?""The man who disappeared?""He was and is my first cousin.""He is in some way connected with Sir Magnus.""Through mamma. Mamma is aunt to Captain Scarborough, and she marriedthe brother of Sir Magnus. Well, he has disappeared and beendisinherited. I cannot explain all about it, for I don't understand it;but he has come to great trouble. It was not on that account that Iwould not marry him. It was partly because I did not like him, andpartly because of Harry Annesley. I will tell you everything because Iwant you to know my story. But my mother has disliked Mr. Annesley,because she has thought that he has interfered with my cousin.""I understand all that.""And she has been taught to think that Mr. Annesley has behaved verybadly. I cannot quite explain it, because there is a brother of CaptainScarborough who has interfered. I never loved Captain Scarborough, butthat man I hate. He has spread those stories. Captain Scarborough hasdisappeared, but before he went he thought it well to revenge himself onMr. Annesley. He attacked him in the street late at night, andendeavored to beat him.""But why?""Why indeed. That such a trumpery cause as a girl's love should operatewith such a man!""I can understand it; oh yes,--I can understand it.""I believe he was tipsy, and he had been gambling, and had lost all hismoney--more than all his money. He was a ruined man, and reckless andwretched. I can forgive him, and so does Harry. But in the struggleHarry got the best of it, and left him there in the street. No weaponshad been used, except that Captain Scarborough had a stick. There was noreason to suppose him hurt, nor was he much hurt. He had behaved verybadly, and Harry left him. Had he gone for a policeman he could onlyhave given him in charge. The man was not hurt, and seems to have walkedaway.""The papers were full of it.""Yes, the papers were full of it, because he was missing. I don't knowyet what became of him, but I have my suspicions.""They say that he has been seen at Monaco.""Very likely. But I have nothing to do with that. Though he was mycousin, I am touched nearer in another place. Young Mr. Scarborough,who, I suspect, knows all about his brother, took upon himself tocross-question Mr. Annesley. Mr. Annesley did not care to tell anythingof that struggle in the streets, and denied that he had seen him. Intruth, he did not want to have my name mentioned. My belief is thatAugustus Scarborough knew exactly what had taken place when he asked thequestion. It was he who really was false. But he is now the heir toTretton and a great man in his way, and in order to injure HarryAnnesley he has spread abroad the story which they all tell here.""But why?""He does;--that is all I know. But I will not be a hypocrite. He chose towish that I should not marry Harry Annesley. I cannot tell you fartherthan that. But he has persuaded mamma, and has told every one. He shallnever persuade me.""Everybody seems to believe him," said Mr. Anderson, not as intending tosay that he believed him now, but that he had done so."Of course they do. He has simply ruined Harry. He too has beendisinherited now. I don't know how they do these things, but it has beendone. His uncle has been turned against him, and his whole income hasbeen taken from him. But they will never persuade me. Nor, if they did,would I be untrue to him. It is a grand thing for a girl to have aperfect faith in the man she has to marry, as I have--as I have. I knowmy man, and will as soon disbelieve in Heaven as in him. But were hewhat they say he is, he would still have to become my husband. I shouldbe broken-hearted, but I should still be true. Thank God, though,--thankGod,--he has done nothing and will do nothing to make me ashamed of him.Now you know my story.""Yes; now I know it." The tears came very near the poor man's eyes as heanswered."And what will you do for me?""What shall I do?""Yes; what will you do? I have told you all my story, believing you tobe a fine-tempered gentleman. You have entertained a fancy which hasbeen encouraged by Sir Magnus. Will you promise me not to speak to me ofit again? Will you relieve me of so much of my trouble? Will you;--willyou?" Then, when he turned away, she followed him, and put both herhands upon his arm. "Will you do that little thing for me?""A little thing!""Is it not a little thing,--when I am so bound to that other man thatnothing can move me? Whether it be little or whether it be much, willyou not do it?" She still held him by the arm, but his face was turnedfrom her so that she could not see it. The tears, absolute tears, wererunning down his cheeks. What did it behoove him as a man to do? Was heto believe her vows now and grant her request, and was she then to giveherself to some third person and forget Harry Annesley altogether? Howwould it be with him then? A faint heart never won a fair lady. All isfair in love and war. You cannot catch cherries by holding your mouthopen. A great amount of wisdom such as this came to him at the spur ofthe moment. But there was her hand upon his arm, and he could not eludeher request. "Will you not do it for me?" she asked again."I will," he said, still keeping his face turned away."I knew it;--I knew you would. You are high-minded and honest, and cannotbe cruel to a poor girl. And if in time to come, when I am HarryAnnesley's wife, we shall chance to meet each other,--as we will,--heshall thank you.""I shall not want that. What will his thanks do for me? You do not thinkthat I shall be silent to oblige him?" Then he walked forth from out ofthe garden, and she had never seen his tears. But she knew well that hewas weeping, and she sympathized with him.CHAPTER XXXII.MR. ANDERSON IS ILL.When they went down to dinner that day it became known that Mr. Andersondid not intend to dine with them. "He's got a headache," said SirMagnus. "He says he's got a headache. I never knew such a thing in mylife before." It was quite clear that Sir Magnus did not think that hislieutenant ought to have such a headache as would prevent his coming todinner, and that he did not quite believe in the headache. There was adinner ready, a very good dinner, which it was his business to provide.He always did provide it, and took a great deal of trouble to see thatit was good. "There isn't a table so well kept in all Brussels," he usedto boast. But when he had done his share he expected that Anderson andArbuthnot should do theirs, especially Anderson. There had beensometimes a few words,--not quite a quarrel but nearly so,--on the subjectof dining out. Sir Magnus only dined out with royalty, cabinetministers, and other diplomats. Even then he rarely got a gooddinner--what he called a good dinner. He often took Anderson with him.He was the _doyen_ among the diplomats in Brussels, and a littleindulgence was shown to him. Therefore he thought that Anderson shouldbe as true to him as was he to Anderson. It was not for Anderson's sake,indeed, who felt the bondage to be irksome;--and Sir Magnus knew that hissubordinate sometimes groaned in spirit. But a good dinner is a gooddinner,--especially the best dinner in Brussels,--and Sir Magnus felt thatsomething ought to be given in return. He had not that perfect faith inmankind which is the surest evidence of a simple mind. Ideas crowdedupon him. Had Anderson a snug little dinner-party, just two or threefriends, in his own room? Sir Magnus would not have been very angry,--hewas rarely very angry,--but he should like to show his cleverness byfinding it out. Anderson had been quite well when he was out riding, andhe did not remember him ever before to have had a headache. "Is he verybad, Arbuthnot?""I haven't seen him, sir, since he was riding.""Who has seen him?""He was in the garden with me," said Florence, boldly."I suppose that did not give him a headache.""Not that I perceived.""It is very singular that he should have a headache just when dinner isready," continued Sir Magnus."You had better leave the young man alone," said Lady Mountjoy.And one who knew the ways of living at the British Embassy would be surethat after this Sir Magnus would not leave the young man alone. Hisnature was not simple. It seemed to him again that there might be alittle dinner-party, and that Lady Mountjoy knew all about it."Richard," he said to the butler, "go into Mr. Anderson's room and seeif he is very bad." Richard came back, and whispered to the great manthat Anderson was not in his room. "This is very remarkable. A badheadache, and not in his room! Where is he? I insist on knowing whereMr. Anderson is!""You had better leave him alone," said Lady Mountjoy."Leave a man alone because he's ill! He might die.""Shall I go and see?" said Arbuthnot."I wish you would, and bring him in here, if he's well enough to show. Idon't approve of a young man going without his dinner. There's nothingso bad.""He'll be sure to get something, Sir Magnus," said Lady Mountjoy. ButSir Magnus insisted that Mr. Arbuthnot should go and look after hisfriend.It was now November, and at eight o'clock was quite dark, but theweather was fine, and something of the mildness of autumn remained.Arbuthnot was not long in discovering that Mr. Anderson was againwalking in the garden. He had left Florence there and had gone to thehouse, but had found himself to be utterly desolate and miserable. Shehad exacted from him a promise which was not compatible with any kind ofhappiness to which he could now look forward. In the first place, allBrussels knew that he had been in love with Florence Mountjoy. Hethought that all Brussels knew it. And they knew that he had been inearnest in this love. He did believe that all Brussels had given himcredit for so much. And now they would know that he had suddenly ceasedto make love. It might be that this should be attributed to gallantry onhis part,--that it should be considered that the lady had been deserted.But he was conscious that he was not so good a hypocrite as not to showthat he was broken-hearted. He was quite sure that it would be seen thathe had got the worst of it. But when he asked himself questions as tohis own condition he told himself that there was suffering in store forhim more heavy to bear than these. There could be no ponies, withFlorence driving them, and a boy in his own livery behind, seen upon theboulevards. That vision was gone, and forever. And then came upon him anidea that the absence of the girl from other portions of his life mighttouch him more nearly. He did feel something like actual love. And themore she had told him of her devotion to Harry Annesley, the morestrongly he had felt the value of that devotion. Why should this manhave it and not he? He had not been disinherited. He had not beenknocked about in a street quarrel. He had not been driven to tell a lieas to his having not seen a man when he had, in truth, knocked him down.He had quite agreed with Florence that Harry was justified in the lie;but there was nothing in it to make the girl love him the better for it.And then, looking forward, he could perceive the possibility of an eventwhich, if it should occur, would cover him with confusion and disgrace.If, after all, Florence were to take, not Harry Annesley, but somebodyelse? How foolish, how credulous, how vain would he have been then tohave made the promise! Girls did such things every day. He had promised,and he thought that he must keep his promise; but she would be bound byno promise! As he thought of it, he reflected that he might even yetexact such a promise from her.But when the dinner-time came he really was sick with love,--or sick withdisappointment. He felt that he could not eat his dinner under thebattery of raillery which was always coming from Sir Magnus, andtherefore he had told the servants that as the evening progressed hewould have something to eat in his own room. And then he went out towander in the dusk beneath the trees in the garden. Here he wasencountered by Mr. Arbuthnot, with his dress boots and white cravat."What the mischief are you doing here, old fellow?""I'm not very well. I have an awfully bilious headache.""Sir Magnus is kicking up a deuce of a row because you're not there.""Sir Magnus be blowed! How am I to be there if I've got a biliousheadache? I'm not dressed. I could not have dressed myself for afive-pound note.""Couldn't you, now? Shall I go back and tell him that? But you must havesomething to eat. I don't know what's up, but Sir Magnus is in ataking.""He's always in a taking. I sometimes think he's the biggest fool out.""And there's the place kept vacant next to Miss Mountjoy. Grascourwanted to sit there, but her ladyship wouldn't let him. And I sat nextMiss Abbott because I didn't want to be in your way.""Tell Grascour to go and sit there, or you may do so. It's all nothingto me." This he said in the bitterness of his heart, by no meansintending to tell his secret, but unable to keep it within his ownbosom."What's the matter, Anderson?" asked the other piteously."I am clean broken-hearted. I don't mind telling you. I know you're agood fellow, and I'll tell you everything. It's all over.""All over--with Miss Mountjoy?" Then Anderson began to tell the wholestory; but before he had got half through, or a quarter through, anothermessage came from Sir Magnus. "Sir Magnus is becoming very angryindeed," whispered the butler. "He says that Mr. Arbuthnot is to goback.""I'd better go, or I shall catch it.""What's up with him, Richard?" asked Anderson."Well, if you ask me, Mr. Anderson, I think he's--a-suspecting ofsomething.""What does he suspect?""I think he's a-thinking that perhaps you are having a jolly time ofit." Richard had known his master many years, and could almost read hisinmost thoughts. "I don't say as it so, but that's what I am thinking.""You tell him I ain't. You tell him I've a bad bilious headache, andthat the air in the garden does it good. You tell him that I mean tohave something to eat up-stairs when my head is better; and do you mindand let me have it, and a bottle of claret."With this the butler went back, and so did Arbuthnot, after asking oneother question: "I'm so sorry it isn't all serene with Miss Mountjoy?""It isn't then. Don't mind now, but it isn't serene. Don't say a wordabout her; but she has done me. I think I shall get leave of absence andgo away for two months. You'll have to do all the riding, old fellow. Ishall go,--but I don't know where I shall go. You return to them now, andtell them I've such a bilious headache I don't know which way to turnmyself."Arbuthnot went back, and found Sir Magnus quarrelling grievously withthe butler. "I don't think he's doing anything as he shouldn't," thebutler whispered, having seen into his master's mind."What do you mean by that?""Do let the matter drop," said Lady Mountjoy, who had also seen into herhusband's mind, and saw, moreover, that the butler had done so. "A youngman's dinner isn't worth all this bother.""I won't let the matter drop. What does he mean when he says that heisn't doing anything that he shouldn't? I've never said anything aboutwhat he was doing.""He isn't dressed, Sir Magnus. He finds himself a little better now, andmeans to have something up-stairs." Then there came an awful silence,during which the dinner was eaten. Sir Magnus knew nothing of the truth,simply suspecting the headache to be a myth. Lady Mountjoy, with awoman's quickness, thought that there had been some words betweenFlorence and her late lover, and, as she disliked Florence, was inclinedto throw all the blame upon her. A word had been said to Mrs.Mountjoy,--"I don't think he'll trouble me any more, mamma,"--which Mrs.Mountjoy did not quite understand, but which she connected with theyoung man's absence. But Florence understood it all, and liked Mr.Anderson the better. Could it really be that for love of her he wouldlose his dinner? Could it be that he was so grievously afflicted at theloss of a girl's heart? There he was, walking out in the dark and thecold, half-famished, all because she loved Harry Annesley so well thatthere could be no chance for him! Girls believe so little in the truthof the love of men that any sign of its reality touches them to thecore. Poor Hugh Anderson! A tear came into her eye as she thought thathe was wandering there in the dark, and all for the love of her. Therest of the dinner passed away in silence, and Sir Magnus hardly becamecordial and communicative with M. Grascour, even under the influence ofhis wine.On the next morning just before lunch Florence was waylaid by Mr.Anderson as she was passing along one of the passages in the back partof the house. "Miss Mountjoy," he said, "I want to ask from your greatgoodness the indulgence of a few words.""Certainly.""Could you come into the garden?""If you will give me time to go and change my boots and get a shawl. Weladies are not ready to go out always, as are you gentlemen.""Anywhere will do. Come in here," and he led the way into a small parlorwhich was not often used."I was so sorry to hear last night that you were unwell, Mr. Anderson.""I was not very well, certainly, after what I had heard before dinner."He did not tell her that he so far recovered as to be able to drink abottle of claret and to smoke a couple of cigars in his bedroom. "Ofcourse you remember what took place yesterday.""Remember! Oh yes. I shall not readily forget it.""I made you a promise--""You did--very kindly.""And I mean to keep it.""I'm sure you do, because you're a gentleman.""I don't think I ought to have made it.""Oh, Mr. Anderson!""I don't think I ought. See what I am giving up.""Nothing, except the privilege of troubling me.""But if it should be something else? Do not be angry with me, but,loving you as I do, of course my mind is full of it. I have promised,and must be dumb.""And I shall be spared great vexation.""But suppose I were to hear that in six months' time you had marriedsome one else?""Mr. Annesley, you mean. Not in six months.""Somebody else. Not Mr. Annesley.""There is nobody else.""But there might be.""It is impossible. After all that I told you, do not you understand?""But if there were?" The poor man, as he made the suggestion, lookedvery piteous. "If there were, I think you should promise me I shall bethat somebody else. That would be no more than fair."She paused a moment to think, frowning the while. "Certainly not.""Certainly not?""I can make no such promise, nor should you ask it. I am to promise thatunder certain circumstances I would become your wife, when I know thatunder no circumstances I would do so.""Under no circumstances?""Under none. What would you have me say, Mr. Anderson? Supposingyourself engaged to marry a girl--""I wish I were--to you.""To a girl who loved you, and whom you loved?""There's no doubt about my loving her.""You can follow my meaning, and I wish that you would do so. What wouldyou think if you were to hear that she had promised to marry some oneelse in the event of your deserting her? It is out of the question. Imean to be the wife of Harry Annesley. Say that it is not to be so, andyou will simply destroy me. Of one thing I may be sure,--that I willmarry him or nobody. You promised me, not because your promise wasnecessary for that, but to spare me from trouble till that time shallcome. And I am grateful,--very grateful." Then she left him sufferingfrom another headache."Was there anything said between you and Mr. Anderson yesterday?" heraunt inquired, that afternoon."Why do you ask?""Because it is necessary that I should know.""I do not see the necessity. Mr. Anderson has, at any rate, yourpermission to say what he likes to me, but I am not on that accountbound to tell you all that he does say. But I will tell you. He haspromised to trouble me no farther. I told him that I was engaged to Mr.Annesley, and he, like a gentleman, has assured me that he will desist.""Just because you asked him?""Yes, aunt; just because I asked him.""He will not be bound by such a promise for a moment. It is a thing notto be heard of. If that kind of thing is to go on, any young lady willbe entitled to ask any young gentleman not to say a word of marriage,just at her request.""Some of the young ladies would not care for that, perhaps.""Don't be impertinent.""I should not, for one, aunt; only that I am already engaged.""And of course the young ladies would be bound to make such requests,which would go for nothing at all. I never heard of anything somonstrous. You are not only to have the liberty of refusing, but are tobe allowed to bind a gentleman not to ask!""He has promised.""Pshaw! It means nothing.""It is between him and me. I asked him because I wished to save myselffrom being troubled.""As for that other man, my dear, it is quite out of the question. Fromall that I hear, it is on the cards that he may be arrested and put intoprison. I am quite sure that at any rate he deserves it. The letterswhich Sir Magnus gets about him are fearful. The things that he hasdone,--well, penal servitude for life would be the proper punishment. Andit will come upon him sooner or later. I never knew a man of that kindescape. And you now to come and tell us that you intend to be his wife!""I do," said Florence, bobbing her head."And what your uncle says to you has no effect?""Not the least in the world; nor what my aunt says. I believe thatneither the one nor the other know what they are talking about. You havebeen defaming a gentleman of the highest character, a Fellow of acollege, a fine-hearted, noble, high-spirited man, simplybecause--because--because--" Then she burst into tears and rushed out ofthe room; but she did not break down before she had looked at her aunt,and spoken to her aunt with a fierce indignation which had altogetherserved to silence Lady Mountjoy for the moment.PART II.CHAPTER XXXIII.MR. BARRY."Good-bye, sir. You ought not to be angry with me. I am sure it will bebetter for us both to remain as we are." This was said by Miss DorothyGrey, as a gentleman departed from her and made his way out of thefront-door at the Fulham Manor-house. Miss Grey had received an offer ofmarriage, and had declined it. The offer had been made by a worthy man,he being no other than her father's partner, Mr. Barry.It may be remembered that, on discussing the affairs of the firm withher father, Dolly Grey had been accustomed to call this partner "theDevil." It was not that she had thought this partner to be speciallydevilish, nor was he so. It had ever been Miss Grey's object to have theaffairs of the firm managed with an integrity which among lawyers mightbe called Quixotic. Her father she had dubbed "Reason," and herself"Conscience;" but in calling Mr. Barry "the Devil" she had not intendedto signify any defalcation from honesty more than ordinary in lawyers'offices. She did, in fact, like Mr. Barry. He would occasionally comeout and dine with her father. He was courteous and respectful, andperformed his duties with diligence. He spent nobody's money but hisown, and not all of that; nor did he look upon the world as a place towhich men were sent that they might play. He was nearly forty years old,was clean, a little bald, and healthy in all his ways. There was nothingof a devil about him, except that his conscience was not peculiarlyattentive to abstract honesty and abstract virtue. There must, accordingto him, be always a little "give and take" in the world; but in thepursuit of his profession he gave a great deal more than he took. Hethought himself to be an honest practitioner, and yet in all domesticprofessional conferences with her father Mr. Barry had always been MissGrey's "Devil."The possibility of such a request as had been now made had been alreadydiscussed between Dolly and her father. Dolly had said that the idea wasabsurd. Mr. Grey had not seen the absurdity. There had been nothing morecommon, he had said, than that a young partner should marry an oldpartner's daughter. "It's not put into the partnership deed?" Dolly hadrejoined. But Dolly had never believed that the time would come. Now ithad come.Mr. Barry had as yet possessed no more than a fourth of the business. Hehad come in without any capital, and had been contented with a fourth.He now suggested to Dolly that on their marriage the business should beequally divided. And he had named the house in which they would live.There was a pleasant, genteel residence on the other side of the water,at Putney. Miss Grey had suggested that the business might be divided ina manner that would be less burdensome to Mr. Barry. As for the house,she could not leave her father. Upon the whole, she had thought that itwould be better for both of them that they should remain as they were.By that Miss Grey had not intended to signify that Mr. Barry was toremain single, but that he would have to do so in reference to MissGrey.When he was gone Dolly Grey spent the remainder of the afternoon incontemplating what would have been her condition had she agreed to joinher lot to that of Mr. Barry, and she came to the conclusion that itwould have been simply unendurable. There was nothing of romance in hernature; but as she looked at matrimony, with all its blisses,--and Mr.Barry among them,--she told herself that death would be preferable. "Iknow myself," she said. "I should come to hate him with a miserablehatred. And then I should hate myself for having done him so great anevil." And as she continued thinking she assured herself that there wasbut one man with whom she could live, and that that was her father. Andthen other questions presented themselves to her, which were not soeasily answered. What would become of her when he should go? He was nowsixty-six, and she was only thirty-two. He was healthy for his age, butwould complain of his work. She knew that he must in course of nature gomuch the first. Ten years he might live, while she might probably becalled upon to endure for thirty more. "I shall have to do it allalone," she said; "all alone; without a companion, without one soul towhom I can open my own. But if I were to marry Mr. Barry," shecontinued, "I should at once be encumbered with a soul to whom I couldnot open my own. I suppose I shall be enabled to live through it, as doothers." Then she began to prepare for her father's coming. As long ashe did remain with her she would make the most of him."Papa," she said, as she took him by the hand as he entered the houseand led him into the dining-room,--"who do you think has been here?""Mr. Barry.""Then he has told you?""Not a word,--not even that he was coming. But I saw him as he left thechambers, and he had on a bright hat and a new coat.""And he thought that those could move me.""I have not known that he has wanted to move you. You asked me to guess,and I have guessed right, it seems.""Yes; you have guessed right.""And why did he come?""Only to ask me to be his wife.""And what did you say to him, Dolly?""What did I say to the Devil?" She still held him by the hand, and nowshe laughed lightly as she looked into his face. "Cannot you guess whatI said to him?""I am sorry for it;--that's all.""Sorry for it? Oh, papa, do not say that you are sorry. Do you want tolose me?""I do not want to think that for my own selfish purposes I have retainedyou. So he has asked you?""Yes; he has asked me.""And you have answered him positively?""Most positively.""And for my sake?""No, papa; I have not said that. I was joking when I asked whether youwished to lose me. Of course you do not want to lose me." Then she woundher arm round him, and put up her face to be kissed. "But now come anddress yourself, as you call it. The dinner is late. We will talk aboutit again after dinner."But immediately after dinner the conversation went away to Mr.Scarborough and the Scarborough matters. "I am to see Augustus, and heis to tell me something about Mountjoy and his affairs. They say thatMountjoy is now in Paris. The money can be given to them now, if he willconsent and will sign the deed releasing the property. But the men havenot all as yet agreed to accept the simple sums which they advanced.That fellow Hart stands out, and says that he would sooner lose it all.""Then he will lose it all," said Dolly."But the squire will consent to pay nothing unless they all agree.Augustus is talking about his excessive generosity.""It is generous on his part," said Dolly."He sees his own advantage, though I cannot quite understand where. Hetells Tyrrwhit that as there is so great an increase to the property heis willing, for the sake of the good name of the family, to pay all thathas been in truth advanced; but he is most anxious to do it now, whilehis father is alive. I think he fears that there will be lawsuits, andthat they may succeed. I doubt whether he thanks his father.""But why should his father lie for his sake, since they are on such badterms?""Because his father was on worse terms with Mountjoy when he told thelie. That is what I think Augustus thinks. But his father told no lie atthat time, and cannot now go back to falsehood. My belief is that if hewere confident that such is the fact he would not surrender a shillingto pay these men their moneys. He may stop a lawsuit, which is likeenough, though they could only lose it. And if Mountjoy should turn outto be the heir, which is impossible, he will be able to turn round andsay that by his efforts he had saved so much of the property.""My head becomes so bewildered," said Dolly, "that I can hardlyunderstand it yet.""I think I understand it; but I can only guess at his mind. But he hasgot Tyrrwhit to accept forty thousand pounds, which is the sum he, intruth, advanced. The stake is too great for the man to lose it withoutruin. He can get it back now, and save himself. But Hart is the moredetermined blackguard. He, with two others, has a claim for thirty-fivethousand pounds, for which he has given but ten thousand pounds in hardcash, and he thinks that he may get some profit out of Tyrrwhit's money,and holds out.""For how much?""For the entire debt, he tells me; but I know that he is trying to dealwith Tyrrwhit. Tyrrwhit would pay him five thousand, I think, so as tosecure the immediate payment of his own money. Then there are a host ofothers who are contented to take what they have advanced, but notcontented if Hart is to have more. There are other men in the backgroundwho advanced the money. All the rascaldom of London is let loose uponme. But Hart is the one man who holds his head the highest.""But if they will accept no terms they will get nothing," said Dolly."If once they attempt to go to law all will be lost.""There are wheels within wheels. When the old man dies Mountjoy himselfwill probably put in a claim to the entire estate, and will get somelawyer to take up the case for him.""You would not?""Certainly not, because I know that Augustus is the eldest legitimateson. As far as I can make it out, Augustus is at present allowingMountjoy the money on which he lives. His father does not. But the oldman must know that Augustus does, though he pretends to be ignorant.""But why is Hart to get money out of Tyrrwhit?""To secure the payment of the remainder. Mr. Tyrrwhit would be very gladto get his forty thousand pounds back; would pay five thousand pounds toget the forty back. But nothing will be paid unless they all agree tojoin in freeing the property. Therefore Hart, who is the sharpest rascalof the lot, stands out for some share of his contemplated plunder.""And you must be joined in such an arrangement?""Not at all. I cannot help surmising what is to be done. In dealing withthe funds of the property I go to the men, and say to them so much, andso much, and so much you have actually lost. Agree among yourselves toaccept that, and it shall be paid to you. That is honest?""I do not know.""But I do. Every shilling that the son of my client has had from them myclient is ready to pay. There is some hitch among them, and I make mysurmises. But I have no dealings with them. It is for them to come to menow." Dolly only shook her head. "You cannot touch pitch and not bedefiled." That was what Dolly said, but said it to herself. And then shewent on and declared to herself still farther, that Mr. Barry was pitch.She knew that Mr. Barry had seen Hart, and had seen Tyrrwhit, and hadbeen bargaining with them. She excused her father because he was herfather; but according to her thinking there should have been nodealings with such men as these, except at the end of a pair of tongs."And now, Dolly," said her father, after a long pause, "tell me aboutMr. Barry.""There is nothing more to be told.""Not of what you said to him, but of the reasons which have made you sodetermined. Would it not be better for you to be married?""If I could choose my husband.""Whom would you choose?""You.""That is nonsense. I am your father.""You know what I mean. There is no one else among my circle ofacquaintances with whom I should care to live. There is no one else withwhom I should care to do more than die. When I look at it all round itseems to be absolutely impossible. That I should on a sudden entertainhabits of the closest intimacy with such a one as Mr. Barry! What shouldI say to him when he went forth in the morning? How should I welcome himwhen he came back at night? What would be our breakfast, and what wouldbe our dinner? Think what are yours and mine,--all the littlesolicitudes, all the free abuse, all the certainty of an affection whichhas grown through so many years; all the absolute assurance on the partof each that the one does really know the inner soul of the other.""It would come.""With Mr. Barry? That is your idea of my soul with which you have beenin communion for so many years? In the first place, you think that I ama person likely to be able to transfer myself suddenly to the first manthat comes my way?""Gradually you might do so,--at any rate so as to make life possible. Youwill be all alone. Think what it will be to have to live all alone.""I have thought. I do know that it would be well that you should be ableto take me with you.""But I cannot.""No. There is the hardship. You must leave me, and I must be alone. Thatis what we have to expect. But for her sake, and for mine, we may beleft while we can be left. What would you be without me? Think of that.""I should bear it.""You couldn't. You'd break your heart and die. And if you can imagine myliving there, and pouring out Mr. Barry's tea for him, you must imaginealso what I should have to say to myself about you. 'He will die, ofcourse. But then he has come to that sort of age at which it doesn'tmuch signify.' Then I should go on with Mr. Barry's tea. He'd come tokiss me when he went away, and I--should plunge a knife into him.""Dolly!""Or into myself, which would be more likely. Fancy that man calling meDolly." Then she got up and stood behind his chair and put her arm roundhis neck. "Would you like to kiss him?--or any man, for the matter ofthat? There is no one else to whom my fancy strays, but I think that Ishould murder them all,--or commit suicide. In the first place, I shouldwant my husband to be a gentleman. There are not a great many gentlemenabout.""You are fastidious.""Come now;--be honest; is our Mr. Barry a gentleman?" Then there was apause, during which she waited for a reply. "I will have an answer. Ihave a right to demand an answer to that question, since you haveproposed the man to me as a husband.""Nay, I have not proposed him.""You have expressed a regret that I have not accepted him. Is he agentleman?""Well;--yes; I think he is.""Mind; we are sworn, and you are bound to speak the truth. What righthas he to be a gentleman? Who was his father and who was his mother? Ofwhat kind were his nursery belongings? He has become an attorney, and sohave you. But has there been any one to whisper to him among histeachings that in that profession, as in all others, there should be asense of high honor to guide him? He must not cheat, or do anything tocause him to be struck off the rolls; but is it not with him what hisclient wants, and not what honor demands? And in the daily intercourseof life would he satisfy what you call my fastidiousness?""Nothing on earth will ever do that.""You do. I agree with you that nothing else on earth ever will. The manwho might, won't come. Not that I can imagine such a man, because I knowthat I am spoiled. Of course there are gentlemen, though not a greatmany. But he mustn't be ugly and he mustn't be good-looking. He mustn'tseem to be old, and certainly he mustn't seem to be young. I should notlike a man to wear old clothes, but he mustn't wear new. He must be wellread, but never show it. He must work hard, but he must come home todinner at the proper time." Here she laughed, and gently shook her head."He must never talk about his business at night. Though, dear, darlingold father, he shall do that if he will talk like you. And then, whichis the hardest thing of all, I must have known him intimately for at anyrate, ten years. As for Mr. Barry, I never should know him intimately,though I were married to him for ten years.""And it has all been my doing?""Just so. You have made the bed and you must lie on it. It hasn't been abad bed.""Not for me. Heaven knows it has not been bad for me.""Nor for me, as things go; only that there will come an arousing beforewe shall be ready to get up together. Your time will probably be thefirst. I can better afford to lose you than you to lose me.""God send that it shall be so!""It is nature," she said. "It is to be expected, and will on thataccount be the less grievous because it has been expected. I shall haveto devote myself to those Carroll children. I sometimes think that thework of the world should not be made pleasant to us. What profit will itbe to me to have done my duty by you? I think there will be some profitif I am good to my cousins.""At any rate, you won't have Mr. Barry?" said the father."Not if I know it," said the daughter; "and you, I think, are a wickedold man to suggest it." Then she bade him good-night and went to bed,for they had been talking now till near twelve.But Mr. Barry, when he had gone home, told himself that he hadprogressed in his love-suit quite as far as he had expected on the firstopportunity. He went over the bridge and looked at the genteel house,and resolved as to certain little changes which should be made. Thus oneroom should look here, and the nursery should look there. The walk tothe railway would only take five minutes, and there would be fiveminutes again from the Temple Station in London. He thought it would dovery well for domestic felicity. And as for a fortune, half the businesswould not be bad. And then the whole business would follow, and he inhis turn would be enabled to let some young fellow in who should do thegreater part of the work and take the smaller part of the pay, as hadbeen the case with himself.But it had not occurred to him that the young lady had meant what shesaid when she refused him. It was the ordinary way with young ladies. Ofcourse he had expected no enthusiasm of love;--nor had he wanted it. Hewould wait for three weeks and then he would go to Fulham again.CHAPTER XXXIV.MR. JUNIPER.Though there was an air of badinage, almost of tomfoolery, about Dollywhen she spoke of her matrimonial prospects to her father,--as when shesaid that she would "stick a knife" into Mr. Barry,--still there was aseriousness in all she said which was more than grave. She was patheticand melancholy. She knew that there was nothing before her but to staywith her father, and then to devote herself to her cousins, from whomshe was aware that she recoiled almost with hatred. And she knew that itwould be a good thing to be married,--if only the right man would come.The right man would have to bear with her father, and live in the samehouse with him to the end. The right man must be a _preux chevalier sanspeur et sans reproche_. The right man must be strong-minded andmasterful, and must have a will of his own; but he must be strong-mindedalways for good. And where was she to find such a man as this? she whowas only an attorney's daughter,--plain, too, and with manyeccentricities. She was not intended to marry, and consequently the onlyman who came in her way was her father's partner, for whom, in regard toa share in the business, she might be desirable.Devotion to the Carroll cousins was manifestly her duty. The two eldestgirls she absolutely did hate, and their father. To hate the father,because he was vicious beyond cure, might be very well; but she couldnot hate the girls without being aware that she was guilty of a grievoussin. Every taste possessed by them was antagonistic to her. Theiramusements, their literature, their clothes, their manners,--especiallyin regard to men,--their gestures and color, were distasteful to her."They hide their dirt with a thin veneer of cheap finery," said Dolly toher father. He had replied by telling her that she was nasty. "No; but,unfortunately, I cannot but see nastiness." Dolly herself was clean tofastidiousness. Take off her coarse frock, and there the well-dressedlady began. "Look at the heels of Sophie's boots! Give her a push, andshe'd fall off her pins as though they were stilts. They're alwaysasking to have a shoemaker's bill paid, and yet they won't wear stoutboots." "I'll pay the man," she said to Amelia one day, "if you'llpromise to wear what I'll buy you for the next six months." But Ameliahad only turned up her nose. These were the relatives to whom it wouldbecome her duty to devote her life!The next morning she started off to call in Bolsover Terrace with anintention, not to begin her duty, but to make a struggle at the adequateperformance of it. She took with her some article of clothing intendedfor one of the younger children, but which the child herself was tocomplete. But when she entered the parlor she was astounded at findingthat Mr. Carroll was there. It was nearly twelve o'clock, and at thattime Mr. Carroll never was there. He was either in bed, or atTattersall's, or--Dolly did not care where. She had long since made upher mind that there must be a permanent quarrel between herself and heruncle, and her desire was generally respected. Now, unfortunately, hewas present, and with him were his wife and two elder daughters. To bedevoted, thought Dolly to herself, to such a family as this,--and withoutanybody else in the world to care for! She gave her aunt a kiss, andtouched the girls' hands, and made a very distant bow to Mr. Carroll.Then she began about the parcel in her hands, and, having given herinstructions, was preparing to depart.But her aunt stopped her. "I think you ought to know, Dorothea.""Certainly," said Mr. Carroll. "It is quite right that your cousinshould know.""If you think it proper, I'm sure I can't object," said Amelia."She won't approve, I'm sure," said Sophie."Her young man has come forward and spoken," said Mr. Carroll."And quite in a proper spirit," said Amelia."Of course," said Mrs. Carroll, "we are not to expect too much. Thoughwe are respectable in birth, and all that, we are poor. Mr. Carroll hasgot nothing to give her.""I've been the most unfortunate man in the world," said Mr. Carroll."We won't talk about that now," continued Mrs. Carroll. "Here we arewithout anything.""You have decent blood," said Dolly; "at any rate on one side,"--for shedid not believe in the Carrolls."On both,--on both," said Mr. Carroll, rising up, and putting his handupon his heart. "I can boast of royal blood among my ancestors.""But here we are without anything," said Mrs. Carroll again. "Mr.Juniper is a most respectable man.""He has been attached to some of the leading racing establishments inthe kingdom," said Mr. Carroll. Dolly had heard of Mr. Juniper as atrainer, though she did not accurately know what a trainer meant."He is almost as great a man as the owner, for the matter of that," saidAmelia, standing up for her lover."He is not to say young,--perhaps forty," said Mrs. Carroll, "and he hasa very decent house of his own at Newmarket." Dolly immediately began tothink whether this might be for the better or for the worse. Newmarketwas a long way off, and the girl would be taken away; and it might be agood thing to dispose of one of such a string of daughters, even to Mr.Juniper. Of course there would be the disagreeable nature of theconnection. But, as Dolly had once said to her father, their share ofthe world's burdens had to be borne, and this was one of them. Her firstcousin must marry the trainer. She, who had spoken so enthusiasticallyabout gentlemen, must put up with it. She knew that Mr. Juniper was buta small man in his own line, but she would never disown him by word ofmouth. He should be her cousin Juniper. But she did hope that she mightnot be called upon to see him frequently. After all, he might be muchmore respectable than Mr. Carroll."I am glad he has a house of his own," said Dolly."It is a much better house than Fulham Manor," said Amelia.Dolly was angered, not at the comparison between the houses, but at theingratitude and insolence of the girl. "Very well," said she, addressingherself to her aunt; "if her parents are contented, of course it is notfor me or for papa to be discontented. The thing to think of is thehonesty of the man and his industry,--not the excellence of the house.""But you seemed to think that we were to live in a pigsty," said Amelia."Mr. Juniper stands very high on the turf," said Mr. Carroll. "Mr.Leadabit's horses have always run straight, and Mousetrap won theTwo-year-old Trial Stakes last spring, giving two pounds toBox-and-Cox. A good-looking, tall fellow. You remember seeing him hereonce last summer." This was addressed to Miss Grey; but Miss Grey hadmade up her mind never to exchange a word with Mr. Carroll."When is it to be, my dear?" said Miss Grey, turning to the ladies, butintending to address herself to Amelia. She had already made up her mindto forgive the girl for her insolence about the house. If the girl wasto be taken away, there was so much the more reason for forgiving herthat and other things."Oh! I thought that you did not mean to speak to me at all," saidAmelia. "I supposed the cut was to be extended from papa to me.""Amelia, how can you be so silly?" said the mother."If you think I'm going to put up with that kind of thing, you'remistaken," said Amelia. She had got not only a lover but a husband inprospect, and was much superior to her cousin,--who had neither one orthe other, as far as she was aware. "Mr. Juniper, with an excellenthouse and a plentiful income, is quite good enough for me, though hehasn't got any regal ancestors." She did not intend to laugh at herfather, but was aware that something had been said about ancestors byher cousin. "A gentleman who has the management of horses is almost thesame as owning them.""But when is it to be?" again asked Dolly."That depends a little upon my brother," said Mrs. Carroll, in a voicehardly above a whisper. "Mr. Juniper has spoken about a day.""Then it will depend chiefly on himself and the young lady, I suppose?""Well, Dorothea, there are money difficulties. There's no denying it.""I wish I could shower gold into her lap," said Mr. Carroll, "only forthe accursed conventionalities of the world.""Bother, papa!" said Sophia."It will be the last of it, as far as I am concerned," said Amelia."Mr. Juniper has said something about a few hundred pounds," said Mrs.Carroll. "It isn't much that he wants."Then Miss Grey spoke in a severe tone. "You must speak to my fatherabout that.""I am not to have your good word, I suppose," said Amelia. Human fleshand blood could not but remember all that had been done, and always withher consent. "Five hundred pounds is not a great deal for portioning offa girl when that is to be the last that she is ever to have." One ofsix nieces whose father and mother were maintained, and that without theslightest claim! It was so that Dorothy argued; but her arguments werekept to her own bosom. "But I must trust to my dear uncle. I see that Iam not to have a word from you."The matter was now becoming serious. Here was the eldest girl, one ofsix daughters, putting in her claim for five hundred pounds portion.This would amount to three thousand pounds for the lot, and, as theprocess of marrying them went on, they would all have to be maintainedas at present. What with their school expenses and their clothes, thenecessary funds for the Carroll family amounted to six hundred pounds ayear. That was the regular allowance, and there were others whenever Mr.Carroll wanted a pair of trousers. And Dolly's acerbation was aroused bya belief on her part that the money asked for trousers took himgenerally to race-courses. And now five hundred pounds was boldlydemanded so as to induce a groom to make one of the girls his wife! Shealmost regretted that in former years she had promised to assist herfather in befriending the Carroll relations. "Perhaps, Dorothea, youwon't mind stepping into my bedroom with me, just for a moment." Thiswas said by Mrs. Carroll, and Dolly most unwillingly followed her auntup-stairs."Of course I know all that you've got to say," began Mrs. Carroll."Then, aunt, why bring me in here?""Because I wish to explain things a little. Don't be ill-natured,Dorothea.""I won't if I can help it.""I know your nature, how good it is." Here Dorothy shook her head. "Onlythink of me and of my sufferings! I haven't come to this withoutsuffering." Then the poor woman began to cry."I feel for you through it all,--I do," said Dolly."That poor man! To have to be always with him, and always doing my bestto keep him out of mischief!""A man who will do nothing else must do harm.""Of course he must. But what can he do now? And the children! I cansee--of course I know that they are not all that they ought to be. Butwith six of them, and nobody but myself, how can I do it all? And theyare his children as well as mine." Dolly's heart was filled with pity asshe heard this, which she knew to be so true! "In answering you theyhave uppish, bad ways. They don't like to submit to one so near theirown age.""Not a word that has come from the mouth of one of them addressed tomyself has ever done them any harm with my father. That is what youmean?""No,--but with yourself.""I do not take anger--against them--out of the room with me.""Now, about Mr. Juniper.""The question is one much too big for me. Am I to tell my father?""I was thinking that--if you would do so!""I cannot tell him that he ought to find five hundred pounds for Mr.Juniper.""Perhaps four would do.""Nor can I ask him to drive a bargain.""How much would he give her--to be married?""Why should he give her anything? He feeds her and gives her clothes. Itis only fit that the truth should be explained to you. Girls socircumstanced, when they are clothed and fed by their own fathers, mustbe married without fortunes or must remain unmarried. As Sophie, andGeorgina, and Minna, and Brenda come up, the same requests will bemade.""Poor Potsey!" said the mother. For Potsey was a plain girl."If this be done for Amelia, must it not be done for all of them? Papais not a rich man, but he has been very generous. Is it fair to ask himfor five hundred pounds to give to--Mr. Juniper?""A gentleman nowadays does not like not to get something.""Then a gentleman must go where something is to be got. The truth has tobe told, Aunt Carroll. My father is willing enough to do what he can foryou and the girls, but I do not think that he will give five hundredpounds to Mr. Juniper.""It is once for all. Four hundred pounds, perhaps, would do.""I do not think that he can make a bargain, nor that he will pay any sumto Mr. Juniper.""To get one of them off would be so much! What is to become of them? Tohave one married would be the way for others. Oh, Dorothy, if you wouldonly think of my condition! I know your papa will do what you tell him."Dolly felt that her father would be more likely to do it if she werenot to interfere at all; but she could not say that. She did feel therequest to be altogether unreasonable. She struggled to avert from herown mind all feeling of dislike for the girl, and to look at it as shemight have done if Amelia had been her special friend."Aunt Carroll," she said, "you had better go up to London and see myfather there--in his chambers. You will catch him if you go at once.""Alone?""Yes, alone. Tell him about the girl's marriage, and let him judge whathe ought to do.""Could not you come with me?""No. You don't understand. I have to think of his money. He can say whathe will do with his own.""He will never give it without coming to you.""He never will if he does come to me. You may prevail with him. A manmay throw away his own money as he pleases. I cannot tell him that heought to do it. You may say that you have told me, and that I have sentyou to him. And tell him, let him do what he will, that I shall find nofault with him. If you can understand me and him you will know that Ican do nothing for you beyond that." Then Dolly took her leave and wenthome.The mother, turning it all over in her mind, did understand something ofher niece, and went off to London as quick as the omnibus could takeher. There she did see her brother, and he came back, in consequence, todinner a little earlier than usual."Why did you send my sister to me?" were the first words which he said toDolly."Because it was your business, and not mine.""How dare you separate my business and yours? What do you think I havedone?""Given the young lady five hundred pounds down on the nail.""Worse than that.""Worse?""Much worse. But why did you send my sister to my chambers?""But what have you done, papa? You don't mean that you have given theshark more than he demands?""I don't know that he's a shark. Why shouldn't the man want five hundredpounds with his wife? Mr. Barry would want much more with you, and wouldbe entitled to ask for much more.""You are my father.""Yes; but those poor girls have been taught to look upon me almost astheir father.""But what have you done?""I have promised them each three hundred and fifty pounds on theirwedding day,--three hundred pounds to go to their husbands, and fiftypounds for wedding expenses,--on condition that they marry with myapproval. I shall not be so hard to please for them as for you.""And you have approved of Mr. Juniper?""I have already set on foot inquiries down at Newmarket; and I have madean exception in favor of Mr. Juniper. He is to have four hundred andfifty pounds. Jane only asked four hundred pounds to begin with. You arenot to find fault with me.""No; that is part of the bargain. I wonder whether my aunt knew what athoroughly good-natured thing I did. We must have no more puddings now,and you must come down by the omnibus.""It is not quite so bad as that, Dolly.""When one has given away one's money extravagantly one ought to be madeto feel the pinch one's self. But dear, dear, darling old man! whyshouldn't you give away your money as you please? I don't want it. I amnot in the least afraid but what there will be plenty for me. But whenthe girl talks about her five hundred pounds so glibly, as though shehad a right to expect it, and spoke of this jockey with such inwardpride of heart--""A girl ought to be proud of her husband.""Your niece ought not to be proud of marrying a groom. But she angeredme, and so did my aunt,--though I pitied her. Then I reflected that theycould get nothing from me in my anger,--not even a promise of a goodword. So I sent her to you. It was, at any rate, the best thing I coulddo for them." Mr. Grey thought that it was.CHAPTER XXXV.MR. BARRY AND MR. JUNIPER.The joy in Bolsover Terrace was intense when Mrs. Carroll returned home."We are all to have three hundred and fifty pound fortunes when we gethusbands!" said Georgina, anticipating at once the pleasures ofmatrimony."I am to have four hundred and fifty," said Amelia. "I do think he mighthave made it five hundred pounds. If I had it to give away, I neverwould show the cloven foot about the last fifty pounds!""But he's only to have four hundred pounds," said Sophia. "Your thingsare to be bought with the other fifty pounds.""I never can do it for fifty pounds," said Amelia. "I did not expectthat I was to find my own trousseau out of my own fortune.""Girls, how can you be so ungrateful?" said their mother."I'm not ungrateful, mamma," said Potsey. "I shall be very much obligedwhen I get my three hundred and fifty pounds. How long will it be?""You've got to find the young man first, Potsey. I don't think you'llever do that," said Georgina, who was rather proud of her own goodlooks.This took place on the evening of the day on which Mrs. Carroll had goneto London, where Mr. Carroll was about attending to some of those dutiesof conviviality in the performance of which he was so indefatigable. Onthe following morning at twelve o'clock he was still in bed. It was awell-known fact in the family that on such an occasion he would lie inbed, and that before twelve o'clock he would have managed to extractfrom his wife's little hoardings at any rate two bottles of soda-waterand two glasses of some alcoholic mixture which was generally calledbrandy. "I'll have a gin-and-potash, Sophie," he had said on thisoccasion, with reference to the second dose, "and do make haste. I wishyou'd go yourself, because that girl always drinks some of thesperrits.""What! go to the gin-shop?""It's a most respectable publican's,--just round the corner.""Indeed, I shall do nothing of the kind. You've no feeling about yourdaughters at all!" But Sophie went on her errand, and in order toprotect her father's small modicum of "sperrits" she slipped on hercloak and walked out so as to be able to watch the girl. Still, I thinkthat the maiden managed to get a sip as she left the bar. The father, inthe mean-time with his head between his hands, was ruminating on the"cocked-up way which girls have who can't do a turn for their father."But with the gin-and-potash, and with Sophie, Mr. Juniper made hisappearance. He was a well-featured, tall man, but he looked the stableand he smelled of it. His clothes, no doubt, were decent, but they weremade by some tailor who must surely work for horsey men and no others.There is a class of men who always choose to show by their outwardappearance that they belong to horses, and they succeed. Mr. Juniper wasone of them. Though good-looking he was anything but young, verging byappearance on fifty years."So he has been at it again, Miss Sophie," said Juniper. Sophie, who didnot like being detected in the performance of her filial duties, led theway in silence into the house, and disappeared up-stairs with thegin-and-potash. Mr. Juniper turned into the parlor, where was Mrs.Carroll with the other girls. She was still angry, as angry as she couldbe, with her husband, who on being informed that morning of what hiswife had done had called her brother "a beastly, stingy old beau,"because he had cut Amelia off with four hundred and fifty instead offive hundred pounds. Mr. Carroll probably knew that Mr. Juniper wouldnot take his daughter without the entirety of the sum stipulated, andwould allow no portion of it to be expended on wedding-dresses."Oh, Dick, is this you?" said Amelia. "I suppose you've come for yournews." (Mr. Juniper's Christian-name was Richard.) On this occasion heshowed no affectionate desire to embrace his betrothed."Yes, it's me," he said, and then gave his hand all round, first to Mrs.Carroll and then to the girls."I've seen Mr. Grey," said Mrs. Carroll. But Dick Juniper held histongue and sat down and twiddled his hat."Where have you come from?" asked Georgina."From the Brompton Road. I come down on a 'bus.""You've come from Tattersall's, young man!" said Amelia."Then I just didn't!" But to tell the truth he had come fromTattersall's, and it might be difficult to follow up the workings of hismind and find out why he had told the lie. Of course it was known thatwhen in London much of his business was done at Tattersall's. But thehorsey man is generally on the alert to take care that no secret of histrade escapes from him unawares. And it may be that he was thus preparedfor a gratuitous lie."Uncle's gone a deal farther than ever I expected," said Amelia."He's been most generous to all the girls," said Mrs. Carroll, movednearly to tears.Mr. Juniper did not care very much about "all the girls," thinking thatthe uncle's affection at the present moment should be shown to the onegirl who had found a husband, and thinking also that if the husband wasto be secured, the proper way of doing so would be by liberality to him.Amelia had said that her uncle had gone farther than she expected. Mr.Juniper concluded from this that he had not gone as far as he had beenasked, and boldly resolved, at the spur of the moment, to stand by hisdemand. "Five hundred pounds ain't much," he said."Dick, don't make a beast of yourself!" said Amelia. Upon this Dick onlysmiled.He continually twiddled his hat for three or four minutes, and then roseup straight. "I suppose," said he, "I had better go up-stairs and talkto the old man. I seed Miss Sophie taking a pick-up to him, so I supposehe'll be able to talk.""Why shouldn't he talk?" said Mrs. Carroll. But she quite understoodwhat Mr. Juniper's words were intended to imply."It don't always follow," said Juniper, as he walked out of the room."Now there'll be a row in the house;--you see if there isn't!" saidAmelia. But Mrs. Carroll expressed her opinion that the man must be themost ungrateful of creatures if he kicked up a row on the presentoccasion. "I don't know so much about that, mamma," said Amelia.Mr. Juniper walked up-stairs with heavy, slow steps, and knocked at thedoor of the marital chamber. There are men who can't walk up-stairs asthough to do so were an affair of ordinary life. They perform the taskas though they walked up-stairs once in three years. It is to bepresumed that such men always sleep on the ground-floor, though wherethey find their bed-rooms it is hard to say. Mr. Juniper was admitted bySophie, who stepped out as he went in. "Well, old fellow! B.--and--S.,and plenty of it. That's the ticket, eh?""I did have a little headache this morning. I think it was the cigars.""Very like,--and the stuff as washed 'em down. You haven't got any moreof the same, have you?""I'm uncommonly sorry," said the sick man, rising up on his elbow, "butI'm afraid there is not. To tell the truth, I had the deuce of a job toget this from the old woman.""It don't matter," said the impassive Mr. Juniper, "only I have beendown among the 'orses at the yard till my throat is full of dust. Soyour lady has been and seen her brother?""Yes; she's done that.""Well?""He ain't altogether a bad un--isn't old Grey. Of course he's anattorney.""I never think much of them chaps.""There's good and bad, Juniper. No doubt my brother-in-law has made alittle money.""A pot of it,--if all they say's true.""But all they say isn't true. All they say never is true.""I suppose he's got something?""Yes, he's got something.""And how is it to be?""He's given the girl four hundred pounds on the nail,"--upon this Mr.Juniper turned up his nose,--"and fifty pounds for her wedding-clothes.""He'd better let me have that.""Girls think so much of it,"--Mr. Juniper only shook his head,--"and, uponmy word, it's more than she had a right to expect.""It ain't what she had a right to expect; but I,"--here Mr. Carroll shookhis head,--"I said five hundred pounds out, and I means to hold by it.That's about it. If he wants to get the girl married, why--he must openhis pocket. It isn't very much that I'm asking. I'm that sort of afellow that, if I didn't want it, I'd take her without a shilling.""But you are that sort of fellow that always does want it.""I wants it now. It's better to speak out, ain't it? I must have the fivehundred pounds before I put my neck into the noose, and there must be noparing off for petticoats and pelisses.""And Mr. Grey says that he must make inquiries into character," saidCarroll."Into what?""Into character. He isn't going to give his money without knowingsomething about the man.""I'm all straight at Newmarket. I ain't going to stand any inquiriesinto me, you know. I can stand inquiries better than some people. He'sgot a partner named Barry, ain't he?""There is such a gentleman. I don't know much about the business ways ofmy respected brother-in-law. Mr. Barry is, I believe, a good sort of aman.""It's he as is acting for Captain Scarborough.""Is it, now? It may be, for anything I know."Then there came a long conversation, during which Mr. Juniper told somedetails of his former life, and expressed himself very freely uponcertain points. It appeared that in the event of Mr. Scarborough havingdied, as was expected, in the course of the early summer, and of CaptainScarborough succeeding to the property in the accustomed manner, Mr.Juniper would have been one of those who would have come forward with asmall claim upon the estate. He had lent, he said, a certain sum ofmoney to help the captain in his embarrassment, and expected to get itback again. Now, latterly inquiries had been made very disagreeable intheir nature to Mr. Juniper; but Mr. Juniper, seeing how the the landlay,--to use his own phrase,--consented only to accept so much as he hadadvanced. "It don't make much difference to me," he had said. "Let mehave the three hundred and fifty pounds which the captain got in hardmoney." Then the inquiries were made by Mr. Barry,--that very Mr. Barryto whom subsequent inquiries were committed,--and Mr. Barry could notsatisfy himself as to the three hundred and fifty pounds which thecaptain was said to have got in hard money. There had been words spokenwhich seemed to Mr. Juniper to make it very inexpedient,--and we may sayvery unfair,--that these farther inquiries into his character as ahusband should be intrusted to the same person. He regarded Mr. Barry asan enemy to the human race, from whom, in the general confusion ofthings, no plunder was to be extracted. Mr Barry had asked for the checkby which the three hundred and fifty pounds had been paid to CaptainScarborough in hard cash. There had been no check, Mr. Juniper had said.Such a small sum as that had been paid in notes at Newmarket. He saidthat he could not, or, rather, that he would not, produce any evidenceas to the money. Mr. Barry had suggested that even so small a sum asthree hundred and fifty pounds could not have come and could not havegone without leaving some trace. Mr. Juniper very indignantly hadreferred to an acknowledgment on a bill-stamp for six hundred poundswhich he had filled in, and which the captain had undoubtedly signed."It's not worth the paper it's written on," Mr. Barry had said."We'll see about that," said Mr. Juniper. "As soon as the breath is outof the old squire's body we'll see whether his son is to repudiate hisdebts in that way. Ain't that the captain's signature?" and he slappedthe bill with his hand.The old ceremony was gone through of explaining that the captain had noright to a shilling of the property. It had become an old ceremony now."Mr. Augustus Scarborough is going to pay out of his own good will onlythose sums of the advance of which he has indisputable testimony.""Ain't he my testimony of this?" said Mr. Juniper."This bill is for six hundred pounds.""In course it is.""Why don't you say you advanced him five hundred and fifty poundsinstead of three hundred and fifty pounds?""Because I didn't.""Why do you say three hundred and fifty pounds instead of one hundredand fifty pounds?""Because I did.""Then we have only your bare word. We are not going to pay any one ashilling on such a testimony." Then Mr. Juniper had sworn an awful oaththat he would have every man bearing the name of Scarborough hanged. ButMr. Barry's firm did not care much for any law proceedings which mightbe taken by Mr. Juniper alone. No law proceedings would be taken. Thesum to be regained would not be worth the while of any lawyer to insurethe hopeless expense of fighting such a battle. It would be shown incourt, on Mr. Barry's side, that the existing owner of the estate, outof his own generosity, had repaid all sums of money as to which evidenceexisted that they had been advanced to the unfortunate illegitimatecaptain. They would appear with clean hands; but poor Mr. Juniper wouldreceive the sympathy of none. Of this Mr. Juniper had by degrees becomeaware, and was already looking on his claim on the Scarborough propertyas lost. And now, on this other little affair of his, on thismatrimonial venture, it was very hard that inquiries as to his charactershould be referred to the same Mr. Barry."I'm d---- if I stand it!" he said, thumping his fist down on Mr.Carroll's bed, on which he was sitting."It isn't any of my doing. I'm on the square with you.""I don't know so much about that.""What have I done? Didn't I send her to the girl's uncle, and didn't sheget from him a very liberal promise?""Promises! Why didn't he stump up the rhino? What's the good ofpromises? There's as much to do about a beggarly five hundred pounds asthough it were fifty thousand pounds. Inquiries!" Of course he knew verywell what that meant. "It's a most ungentlemanlike thing for onegentleman to take upon himself to make inquiries about another. He isnot the girl's father. What right has he to make inquiries?""I didn't put it into his head," said Carroll, almost sobbing."He must be a low-bred, pettifogging lawyer.""He is a lawyer," said Carroll, on whose mind the memory of the greatbenefit he had received had made some impression. "I have admittedthat.""Pshaw!""But I don't think he's pettifogging; not Mr. Grey. Four hundred poundsdown, with fifty pounds for dress, and the same, or most the same, toall the girls, isn't pettifogging. If you ever comes to have a family,Juniper--""I ain't in the way.""But when you are, and there comes six of 'em, you won't find an unclepettifogging when he speaks out like Mr. Grey."The conversation was carried on for some time farther, and then Mr.Juniper left the house without again visiting the ladies. His last wordwas that if inquiries were made into him they might all go to--Bath! Ifthe money were forthcoming, they would know where to find him; but itmust be five hundred pounds "square," with no parings made from it onbehalf of petticoats and pelisses. With this last word Mr. Juniperstamped down the stairs and out of the house."He's a brute, after all!" said Sophie."No, he isn't. What do you know about brutes? Of course a gentleman hasto make the best fight he can for his money." This was what Amelia saidat the moment; but in the seclusion of their own room she wept bitterly."Why didn't he come in to see me and just give me one word? I hadn'tdone anything amiss. It wasn't my fault if Uncle John is stingy.""And he isn't so very stingy, after all," said Sophie."Of course papa hasn't got anything, and wouldn't have anything, thoughyou were to pour golden rivers into his lap.""There are worse than papa," said Sophie."But he knows all that, and that our uncle isn't any more than an uncle.And why should he be so particular just about a hundred pounds? I dothink gentlemen are the meanest creatures when they are looking aftermoney! Ladies ain't half so bad. He'd no business to expect five hundredpounds all out."This was very melancholy, and the house was kept in a state of silentsorrow for four or five days, till the result of the inquiries hadcome. Then there was weeping and gnashing of teeth. Mr. Barry came toBolsover Terrace to communicate the result of the inquiry, and was shutup for half an hour with poor Mrs. Carroll. He was afraid that he couldnot recommend the match. "Oh, I'm sorry for that,--very sorry!" said Mrs.Carroll. "The young lady will be--disappointed." And her handkerchiefwent up to her eyes. Then there was silence for awhile, till she askedwhy an opinion so strongly condemnatory had been expressed."The gentleman, ma'am,--is not what a gentleman should be. You may takemy word for it. I must ask you not to repeat what I say to him.""Oh dear, no.""But perhaps the least said the soonest mended. He is not what agentleman should be.""You mean a--fine gentleman.""He is not what a man should be. I cannot say more than that. It wouldnot be for the young lady's happiness that she should select such apartner for her life.""She is very much attached to him.""I am sorry that it should be so. But it will be better that sheshould--live it down. At any rate, I am bound to communicate to you Mr.Grey's decision. Though he does not at all mean to withhold his bountyin regard to any other proposed marriage, he cannot bring himself to paymoney to Mr. Juniper.""Nothing at all?" asked Mrs. Carroll."He will make no payment that will go into the pocket of Mr. Juniper."Then Mr. Barry went, and there was weeping and wailing in the house inBolsover Terrace. So cruel an uncle as Mr. Grey had never been heard ofin history, or even in romance. "I know it's that old cat, Dolly," saidAmelia. "Because she hasn't managed to get a husband for herself, shedoesn't want any one else to get one.""My poor child," said Mr. Carroll, in a maudlin condition, "I pity theefrom the bottom of my heart!""I wish that Mr. Barry may be made to marry a hideous old maid pastforty," said Georgina."I shouldn't care what they said, but would take him straight off," saidSophie.Upon this Mrs. Carroll shook her head. "I don't suppose that he is quiteall that he ought to be.""Who is, I should like to know?" said Amelia."But my brother has to give his money according to his judgment." Asshe said this the poor woman thought of those other five who in processof time might become claimants. But here the whole family attacked her,and almost drove her to confess that her brother was a stingy oldcurmudgeon.CHAPTER XXXVI."GURNEY & MALCOLMSON'S."In Red Lion Square, on the first floor of a house which partakes of thegeneral dinginess of the neighborhood, there are two rooms which bear onthe outside door the well-sounding names of Gurney & Malcolmson; and onthe front door to the street are the names of Gurney & Malcolmson,showing that the business transacted by Messrs. Gurney & Malcolmsonoutweighs in importance any others conducted in the same house. In thefirst room, which is the smaller of the two occupied, sits usually alad, who passes most of his time in making up and directing circulars,so that a stranger might be led to suppose that the business of Gurney &Malcolmson was of an extended nature.But on the occasion to which we are about to allude the door of thepremises was closed, and the boy was kept on the alert posting, orperhaps delivering, the circulars which were continually issued. Thiswas the place of business affected by Mr. Tyrrwhit, or at any rate oneof them. Who were Gurney & Malcolmson it is not necessary that ourchronicle should tell. No Gurney or no Malcolmson was then visible; andthough a part of the business of the firm in which it is to be supposedthat Gurney & Malcolmson were engaged was greatly discussed, their nameon the occasion was never mentioned.A meeting had been called at which the presiding genius was Mr.Tyrrwhit. You might almost be led to believe that, from the manner inwhich he made himself at home, Mr. Tyrrwhit was Gurney & Malcolmson. Butthere was another there who seemed to be almost as much at home as Mr.Tyrrwhit, and this was Mr. Samuel Hart, whom we last saw when he hadunexpectedly made himself known to his friend the captain at Monaco. Hehad a good deal to say for himself; and as he sat during the meetingwith his hat on, it is to be presumed that he was not in awe of hiscompanions. Mr. Juniper also was there. He took a seat at one corner ofthe table, and did not say much. There was also a man who, in speakingof himself and his own affairs, always called himself Evans & Crooke.And there was one Spicer, who sat silent for the most part, and lookedvery fierce. In all matters, however, he appeared to agree with Mr.Tyrrwhit. He is especially named, as his interest in the matterdiscussed was large. There were three or four others, whose affairs wereof less moment, though to them they were of intense interest. Thesegentlemen assembled were they who had advanced money to CaptainScarborough, and this was the meeting of the captain's creditors, atwhich they were to decide whether they were to give up their bonds onpayment of the sums they had actually advanced, or whether they wouldstand out till the old squire's death, and then go to law with the ownerof the estate.At the moment at which we may be presumed to be introduced, Mr. Tyrrwhithad explained the matter in a nervous, hesitating manner, but still inwords sufficiently clear. "There's the money down now if you like totake it, and I'm for taking it." These were the words with which Mr.Tyrrwhit completed his address."Circumstances is different," said the man with his hat on."I don't know much about that, Mr. Hart," said Tyrrwhit."Circumstances is different. I can't 'elp whether you know it or not.""How different?""They is different,--and that's all about it. It'll perhaps shuit you andthem other shentlemen to take a pershentage.""It won't suit Evans & Crooke," said the man who represented that firm."But perhaps Messrs. Evans & Crooke may be willing to save so much oftheir property," said Mr. Tyrrwhit."They'd like to have what's due to 'em.""We should all like that," said Spicer, and he gnashed his teeth andshook his head."But we can't get it all," said Tyrrwhit."Speak for yourself, Mr. Tyrrwhit," said Hart. "I think I can get mine.This is the most almighty abandoned swindle I ever met in all my borndays." The whole meeting, except Mr. Tyrrwhit, received this assertionwith loudly expressed applause. "Such a blackguard, dirty, thieving jobnever was up before in my time. I don't know 'ow to talk of it inlanguage as a man isn't ashamed to commit himself to. It's downrightrobbery.""I say so too," said Evans & Crooke."By George!" continued Mr. Hart, "we come forward to 'elp a shentlemanin his trouble and to wait for our moneys till the father is dead, andthen when 'e's 'ad our moneys the father turns round and says that 'isown son is a--Oh, it's too shocking! I 'aven't slept since I 'eardit,--not a regular night's rest. Now, it's my belief the captain 'as no'and in it."Here Mr. Juniper scratched his head and looked doubtful, and one or twoof the other silent gentlemen scratched their heads. Messrs. Evans &Crooke scratched his head. "It's a matter on which I would not like togive an opinion one way or the other," said Tyrrwhit."No more wouldn't I," said Spicer."Let every man speak as he finds," continued Hart. "That's my belief. Idon't mind giving up a little of my claim, just a thousand or so, forready cash. The old sinner ought to be dead, and can't last long. Mybelief is when 'e's gone I'm so circumstanced I shall get the whole.Whether or no, I've gone in for 'elping the captain with all my savings,and I mean to stick to them.""And lose everything," said Tyrrwhit."Why don't we go and lug the old sinner into prison?" said Evans &Crooke."Certainly that's the game," said Juniper, and there was another loudacclamation of applause from the entire room."Gentlemen, you don't know what you're talking about, you don't indeed,"said Tyrrwhit."I don't believe as we do," said Spicer."You can't touch the old gentleman. He owes you nothing, nor have you ascratch of his pen. How are you to lug an old gentleman to prison whenhe's lying there cut up by the doctors almost to nothing? I don't knowthat anybody can touch him. The captain perhaps might, if the presentstory be false; and the younger son, if the other be true. And thenthey'd have to prove it. Mr. Grey says that no one can touch him.""He's in the swim as bad as any of 'em," said Evans & Crooke."Of course he is," said Hart. "But let everybody speak for himself. I'vegone in to 'earn a 'eavy stake honestly.""That's all right," said Evans & Crooke."And I mean to 'ave it or nothing. Now, Mr. Tyrrwhit, you know a pieceof my mind. It's a biggish lot of money.""We know what your claim is.""But no man knows what the captain got, and I don't mean 'em to know.""About fifteen thousand," came in a whisper from some one in the room."That's a lie," said Mr. Hart; "so there's no getting out of that. Ifthe shentleman will mind 'is own concerns I'll mind mine. Nobodyknows,--barring the captain, and he like enough has forgot,--and nobody'sgoing to know. What's written on these eight bits of paper everybody mayknow," and he pulled out of a large case or purse, which he carried inhis breast coat-pocket, a fat sheaf of bills. "There are five thou'written on each of them, and for five thou' on each of them I means tostand out. 'It or miss. If any shentleman chooses to talk to me aboutready money I'll take two thou' off. I like ready money as well asanother.""We can all say the same as that, Mr. Hart," said Tyrrwhit."No doubt. And if you think you can get it, I advise you to stick to it.If you thought you could get it you would say the same. But I shouldlike to get that old man's 'ead between my fists. Wouldn't I punch it!Thief! scoundrel! 'orrid old man! It ain't for myself that I'm speakingnow, because I'm a-going to get it,--I think I'm a-going to get it;--it'sfor humanity at large. This kind of thing wiolates one's best feelings.""'Ear, 'ear, 'ear!" said one of the silent gentlemen."Them's the sentiments of Evans & Crooke," said the representative ofthat firm."They're all our sentiments, in course," said Spicer; "but what's theuse?""Not a ha'p'orth," said Mr. Tyrrwhit."Asking your pardon, Mr. Tyrrwhit," said Mr. Hart, "but, as this is ameeting of creditors who 'ave a largish lot of money to deal with, Idon't think they ought to part without expressing their opinions in theway of British commerce. I say crucifying 'd be too good for 'im.""You can't get at him to crucify him.""There's no knowing about that," said Mr. Hart."And now," said Mr. Tyrrwhit, drawing out his watch, "I expect Mr.Augustus Scarborough to call upon us.""You can crucify _him_," said Evans & Crooke."It is the old man, and neither of the sons, as have done it," saidHart."Mr. Scarborough," continued Tyrrwhit, "will be here, and will expect tolearn whether we have accepted his offer. He will be accompanied by Mr.Barry. If one rejects, all reject.""Not at all," said Hart."He will not consent to pay anything unless he can make a clean hit ofit. He is about to sacrifice a very large sum of money.""Sacrifice!" said Juniper."Yes; sacrifice a very large sum of money. His father cannot pay itwithout his consent. The father may die any day, and then the money willbelong altogether to the son. You have, none of you, any claim upon him.It is likely he may think you will have a claim on the estate, nottrusting his own father.""I wouldn't trust him, not 'alf as far as I could see him, though he wastwice my father." This again came from Mr. Hart."I want to explain to these gentlemen how the matter stands.""They understand," said Hart."I'm for securing my own money. It's very hard,--after all the risk. Iquite agree with Mr. Hart in what he says about the squire. Such a pieceof premeditated dishonesty for robbing gentlemen of their property Inever before heard. It's awful.""'Orrid old man!" said Mr. Hart."Just so. But half a loaf is better than no bread. Now, here is a list,prepared in Mr. Grey's chambers.""'E's another, nigh as 'orrid.""On this list we're all down, with the sums he says we advanced. Are weto take them? If so we must sign our names, each to his own figure."Then he passed the list down the table.The men there assembled all crowded to look at the list, and amongothers Mr. Juniper. He showed his anxiety by the eager way in which henearly annihilated Messrs. Evans & Crooke, by leaning over him as hestruggled to read the paper. "Your name ain't down at all," said Evans &Crooke. Then a tremendous oath, very bitter and very wicked, came fromthe mouth of Mr. Juniper, most unbefitting a young man engaged to marrya young lady. "I tell you it isn't here," said Evans & Crooke, trying toextricate himself."I shall know how to right myself," said Juniper, with another oath.And he then walked out of the room."The captain, when he was drunk one night, got a couple of ponies fromhim. It wasn't a couple all out. And Juniper made him write his name forfive hundred pounds. It was thought then that the squire 'd have beendead next day, and Juniper 'd 've got a good thing."'"I 'ate them ways," said Mr. Hart. "I never deal with a shentleman ifhe's, to say--drunk. Of course it comes in my way, but I never does."Now there was heard a sound of steps on the stairs, and Mr. Tyrrwhitrose from his chair so as to perform the duty of master of theceremonies to the gentlemen who were expected. Augustus Scarboroughentered the room, followed by Mr. Barry. They were received withconsiderable respect, and seated on two chairs at Mr. Tyrrwhit's righthand. "Gentlemen, you most of you know these two gentlemen. They are Mr.Augustus Scarborough and Mr. Barry, junior partner in the firm ofMessrs. Grey & Barry.""We knows 'em," said Hart."My client has made a proposition to you," said Mr. Barry. "If you willgive up your bonds against his brother, which are not worth the paperthey are written on--""Gammon!" said Mr. Hart."I will sign checks paying to you the sums of money written on thatlist. But you must all agree to accept such sums in liquidation in full.I see you have not signed the paper yet. No time is to be lost. In fact,you must sign it now, or my client will withdraw from his offer.""Withdraw; will 'e?" said Hart. "Suppose we withdraw? 'O does yourclient think is the honestest man in this 'ere swim?"Mr. Barry seemed somewhat abashed by this question. "It isn't necessaryto go into that, Mr. Hart," said he.Mr. Hart laughed long and loud, and all the gentlemen laughed. There wassomething to them extremely jocose in their occupying, as it were, theother side of the question, and appearing as the honest, injured party.They enjoyed it thoroughly, and Mr. Hart was disposed to make the mostof it. "No; it ain't necessary; is it? There ain't no question ofhonesty to be asked in this 'ere business. We quite understand that."Then up and spoke Augustus Scarborough. He rose to his feet, and thevery fact of his doing so quieted for a time the exuberant mirth of theparty. "Gentlemen, Mr. Hart speaks to you of honesty. I am not going toboast of my own. I am here to consent to the expenditure of a very largesum of money, for which I am to get nothing, and which, if not paid toyou, will all go into my own pocket;--unless you believed that youwouldn't be here to meet me.""We don't believe nothing," said Hart."Mr. Hart, you should let Mr. Scarborough speak," said Tyrrwhit."Vell, let 'im speak. Vat's the odds?""I do not wish to delay you, nor to delay myself," continued Augustus."I can go, and will go, at once. But I shall not come back. There is nogood discussing this matter any longer.""Oh no; not the least. Ve don't like discussion; do ve, captain?" saidMr. Hart. "But you ain't the captain; is you?""As there seems to be no intention of signing that document, I shallgo," said Augustus. Then Mr. Tyrrwhit took the paper, and signed it onthe first line with his own name at full length. He wrote his name to avery serious sum of money, but it was less than half what he and othershad expected to receive when the sum was lent. Had that been realizedthere would have been no farther need for the formalities of Gurney &Malcolmson, and that young lad must have found other work to do than theposting of circulars. The whole matter, however, had been muchconsidered, and he signed the document. Mr. Hart's name came next, buthe passed it on. "I ain't made up my mind yet. Maybe I shall have tocall on Mr. Barry. I ain't just consulted my partner." Then the documentwent down to Mr. Spicer, who signed it, grinning horribly; as did alsoEvans & Crooke and all the others. They did believe that was the onlyway in which they could get back the money they had advanced. It was agreat misfortune, a serious blow. But in this way there was somethingshort of ruin. They knew that Scarborough was about to pay the money, sothat he might escape a lawsuit, which might go against him; but thenthey also wished to avoid the necessity of bringing the lawsuit. Lookingat the matter all round, we may say that the lawyers were the personsmost aggrieved by what was done on that morning. They all signed it asthey sat there,--except Mr. Hart, who passed it on, and still wore hishat."You won't agree, Mr. Hart?" said Tyrrwhit."Not yet I von't," said Hart. "I ain't thought it out. I ain't in thesame boat with the rest. I'm not afraid of my money. I shall get thatall right.""Then I may as well go," said Augustus."Don't be in a hurry, Mr. Scarborough," said Tyrrwhit. "Things of thiskind can't be done just in a moment." But Augustus explained that theymust be done in a very few moments, if they were to be done at all. Itwas not his intention to sit there in Gurney & Malcolmson's officediscussing the matter with Mr. Hart. Notice of his intention had beengiven, and they might take his money or leave it."Just so, captain," said Mr. Hart. "Only I believe you ain't thecaptain. Where's the captain now? I see him last at Monte Carlo, and hehad won a pot of money. He was looking uncommon well after his littleaccident in the streets with young Annesley."Mr. Tyrrwhit contrived to get all the others out of the room, heremaining there with Hart and Augustus Scarborough and Mr. Barry. Andthen Hart did sign the document with altered figures: only that so muchwas added on to the sum which he agreed to accept, and a similardeduction made from that to which Mr. Tyrrwhit's name was signed. Butthis was not done without renewed expostulation from the lattergentleman. It was very hard, he said, that all the sacrifice should bemade by him. He would be ruined, utterly ruined by the transaction. Buthe did sign for the altered sum, and Mr. Hart also signed the paper."Now, Mr. Barry, as the matter is completed, I think I will withdraw,"said Augustus."It's five thousand pounds clean gone out of my pocket," said Hart, "andI vas as sure of it as ever I vas in my life. There vas no better moneythan the captain's. Vell, vell! This vorld's a queer place." So saying,he followed Augustus and Mr. Barry out of the room, and left Mr.Tyrrwhit alone in his misery.CHAPTER XXXVII.VICTORIA STREET.Lounging in an arm-chair in a small but luxuriously furnished room inVictoria Street sat Captain Mountjoy Scarborough, and opposite to him,equally comfortably placed, as far as externals were concerned, butwithout any of that lounging look which the captain affected, sat hisbrother. It was nearly eight o'clock, and the sound of the dinner-platescould be heard through the open doors from the next room. It wasevident, or at any rate was the fact, that Augustus found his brother'spresence a bore, and as evident that the captain intended to disregardthe dissatisfaction evinced by the owner of the chambers. "Do shut thedoor, Mountjoy," said the younger. "I don't suppose we want the servantto hear everything that we say.""He's welcome for me," said Mountjoy, without moving. Then Augustus gotup and banged the door. "Don't be angry because I sometimes forget thatI am no longer considered to be your elder brother," said Mountjoy."Bother about elder brothers! I suppose you can shut a door?""A man is sometimes compelled by circumstances to think whether he canor not. I'd've shut the door for you readily enough the other day. Idon't know that I can now. Ain't we going to have some dinner? It'seight o'clock.""I suppose they'll get dinner for you;--I'm not going to dine here." Thetwo men were both dressed and after this they remained silent for thenext five minutes. Then the servant came in and said that dinner wasready.All this happened in December. It must be explained that the captain hadcome to London at his brother's instance, and was there, in his rooms,at his invitation. Indeed, we may say that he had come at his brother'scommand. Augustus had during the last few months taken upon himself todirect the captain's movements; and though he had not always beenobeyed, still, upon the whole, his purposes had been carried out as wellas he could expect. He had offered to supply the money necessary for thecaptain's tour, and had absolutely sent a servant to accompany thetraveller. When the traveller had won money at Monaco he had beenunruly, but this had not happened very often. When we last saw him hehad expressed his intention to Mr. Hart of making a return journey tothe Caucasian provinces. But he got no farther than Genoa on his way tothe Caucasus, and then, when he found that Mr. Hart was not at his back,he turned round and went back to Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo, of all placeson the world's surface, had now charms for him.There was no longer a club open to him, either in London or Paris, atwhich he could win or lose one hundred pounds. At Monte Carlo he couldstill do so readily; and, to do so, need not sink down into anypeculiarly low depth of social gathering. At Monte Carlo the _ennui_ ofthe day was made to disappear. At Monte Carlo he could lie in bed tilleleven, and then play till dinner-time. At Monte Carlo there was alwayssome one who would drink a glass of wine with him without inquiring tooclosely as to his antecedents. He had begun by winning a large sum ofmoney. He had got some sums from his brother, and when at last he wassummoned home he was penniless. Had his pocket been still full of moneyit may be doubted whether he would have come, although he understoodperfectly the importance of the matter on which he had been recalled.He had been sent for in order that he might receive from Mr. Grey aclear statement of what it was intended to do in reference to thepayment of money to the creditors. Mr. Grey had, in the first place,endeavored to assure him that his co-operation was in no respect madenecessary by the true circumstances of the case, but in order to satisfythe doubts of certain persons. The money to be paid was the jointproperty of his father and his brother,--of his father, as far as the useof it for his life was concerned, and of his brother, as to itscontinued and perpetual enjoyment. They were willing to pay so much forthe redemption of the bonds given by him, the captain. As far as thesebonds were concerned the captain would thus be a free man. There couldbe no doubt that nothing but benefit was intended for him,--as though hewere himself the heir. "Though as to that I have no hesitation intelling you that, you will at your father's death have no right to ashilling of the property." The captain had said that he was quitewilling, and had signed the deed. He was glad that these bonds should berecovered so cheaply. But as to the property,--and here he spoke withmuch spirit to Mr. Grey,--it was his purpose at his father's death toendeavor to regain his position. He would never believe, he said, thathis mother was--Then he turned away, and, in spite of all that had comeand gone, Mr. Grey respected him.But he had signed the deed, and the necessity for his presence was over.What should his brother do with him now? He could not keep himconcealed,--or not concealed,--in his rooms. But something must be done.Some mode of living must be invented for him. Abroad! Augustus said tohimself,--and to Septimus Jones, who was his confidential friend,--thatMountjoy must live "abroad.""Oh yes; he must go abroad. There's no doubt about that. It's the onlyplace for him." So spoke Septimus Jones, who, though confidentialfriend, was not admitted to the post of confidential adviser. Augustusliked to have a depositary for his resolutions, but would admit noadvice. And Septimus Jones had become so much his creature that he hadto obey him in all things.We are apt to think that a man may be disposed of by being made to goabroad; or, if he is absolutely penniless and useless, by being sent tothe colonies,--that he may become a shepherd and drink himself out of theworld. To kill the man, so that he may be no longer a nuisance, isperhaps the chief object in both cases. But it was not easy to get thecaptain to go abroad unless, indeed, he was sent back to Monte Carlo.Some Monte Carlo, such as a club might be with stakes practicallyunlimited, was the first desire of his heart. But behind that, ortogether with it, was an anxious longing to remain near Tretton and "seeit out," as he called it, when his father should die. His father mustdie very shortly, and he would like "to see it out," as he told Mr.Grey; and, with this wish, there was a longing also for the company ofFlorence Mountjoy.He used to tell himself, in those moments of sad thoughts,--thoughtsserious as well as sad, which will come even to a gambler,--that if hecould have Tretton and Florence Mountjoy he would never touch anothercard. And there was present to him an assurance that his aunt, Mrs.Mountjoy, would still be on his side. If he could talk over hiscircumstances with Mrs. Mountjoy, he thought that he might be encouragedto recover his position as an English gentleman. His debts at the clubhad already been paid, and he had met on the sly a former friend, whohad given him some hope that he might be re-admitted. But at the presentmoment his mind turned to Brussels. He had learned that Florence and hermother were at the embassy there, and, though he hesitated, still hedesired to go. But this was not the "abroad" contemplated by Augustus.Augustus did not think it well that his father's bastard son, who hadbeen turned out of a London club for not paying his card debts, and hadthen disappeared in a mysterious way for six months, should show himselfat the British embassy, and there claim admittance and relationship. Norwas he anxious that his brother should see Florence Mountjoy. He hadsuggested a prolonged tour in South America, which he had declared to bethe most interesting country in the world. "I think I had rather go toBrussels," Mountjoy had answered, gallantly, keeping his seat in thearm-chair and picking his teeth the while. This occurred on the eveningbefore that on which we found them just now. On the morning of that dayMountjoy had had his interview with Mr. Grey.Augustus had declared that he intended to dine out. This he had said indisgust at his brother's behavior. No doubt he could get his dinner atten minutes' notice. He had not been expelled from his club. But he hadordered the dinner on that day with a view to eat it himself, and ineffect he carried out his purpose. The captain got up, thinking to goalone when the dinner was announced, but expressed himself gratifiedwhen his brother said that he "had changed his mind." "You made yourselfsuch an ass about shutting the door that I resolved to leave you toyourself. But come along." And he accompanied the captain into the otherroom.A very pretty little dinner was prepared,--quite such as one lovingfriend might give to another, when means are sufficient,--such a dinneras the heir of Tretton might have given to his younger brother. Thechampagne was excellent, and the bottle of Leoville. Mountjoy partook ofall the good things with much gusto, thinking all the while that heought to have been giving the dinner to his younger brother. When thatconversation had sprung up about going to Brussels or South America,Mountjoy had suggested a loan. "I'll pay your fare to Rio, and give youan order on a banker there." Mountjoy had replied that that would not atall suit his purpose. Then Augustus had felt that it would be almostbetter to send his brother even to Brussels than to keep him concealedin London. He had been there now for three or four days, and, even inrespect of his maintenance, had become a burden. The pretty littledinners had to be found every day, and were eaten by the captain alone,when left alone, without an attempt at an apology on his part. Augustushad begun with some intention of exhibiting his mode of life. He wouldlet his brother know what it was to be the heir of Tretton. No doubt hedid assume all the outward glitter of his position, expecting to fillhis brother's heart with envy. But Mountjoy had seen and understood itall; and remembering the days, not long removed, when he had been theheir, he bethought himself that he had never shown off before hisbrother. And he was determined to express no gratitude or thankfulness.He would go on eating the little dinners exactly as though they had beenfurnished by himself. It certainly was dull. There was no occupation forhim, and in the matter of pocket-money he was lamentably ill-supplied.But he was gradually becoming used to face the streets again and hadalready entered the shops of one or two of his old tradesmen. He hadquite a confidential conversation with his boot-maker, and had orderedthree or four new pairs of boots.Nobody could tell how the question of the property would be decided tillhis father should have died. His father had treated him most cruelly,and he would only wait for his death. He could assure the boot-makerthat when that time came he should look for his rights. He knew thatthere was a suspicion abroad that he was in a conspiracy with his fatherand brother to cheat his creditors. No such thing. He himself wascheated. He pledged himself to the boot-maker that, to the best of hisbelief, his father was robbing him, and that he would undoubtedly asserthis right to the Tretton property as soon as the breath should be out ofhis father's body. The truth of what he told the boot-maker he certainlydid believe. There was some little garnishing added to his tale,--which,perhaps, under the circumstances, was to be forgiven. The blow had comeupon him so suddenly, he said, that he was not able even to pay his cardaccount, and had left town in dismay at the mine which had been explodedunder his feet. The boot-maker believed him so far that he undertook tosupply his orders.When the dinner had been eaten the two brothers lit their cigars anddrew to the fire. "There must, unfortunately, come an end to this, youknow," said Augustus."I certainly can't stand it much longer," said Mountjoy."You, at any rate, have had the best of it. I have endeavored to make mylittle crib comfortable for you.""The grub is good, and the wine. There's no doubt about that. Somebodysays somewhere that nobody can live upon bread alone. That includes thewhole _menu_, I suppose.""What do you suggest to do with yourself?""You said, go abroad.""So I did--to Rio.""Rio is a long way off,--somewhere across the equator, isn't it?""I believe it is.""I think we'd better have it out clearly between us, Augustus. It won'tsuit me to be at Rio Janeiro when our father dies.""What difference will his death make to you?""A father's death generally does make a difference to his eldest son,particularly if there is any property concerned.""You mean to say that you intend to dispute the circumstances of yourbirth?""Dispute them! Do you think that I will allow such a thing to be said ofmy mother without disputing it? Do you suppose that I will give up myclaim to one of the finest properties in England without disputing it?""Then I had better stop the payment of that money, and let the gentlemenknow that you mean to raise the question on their behalf.""That's your affair. The arrangement is a very good one for me; but youmade it.""You know very well that your present threat means nothing. Ask Mr.Grey. You can trust him.""But I can't trust him. After having been so wickedly deceived by my ownfather, I can trust no one. Why did not Mr. Grey find it out before, ifit be true? I give you my word, Augustus, the lawyers will have to fightit out before you will be allowed to take possession.""And yet you do not scruple to come and live here at my cost.""Not in the least. At whose cost can I live with less scruple than atyours? You, at any rate, have not robbed our mother of her good name, asmy father has done. The only one of the family with whom I could notstay is the governor. I could not sit at the table with a man who has sodisgraced himself.""Upon my word I am very much obliged to you for the honor you do me.""That's my feeling. The chance of the game and his villany have givenyou for the moment the possession of all the good things. They are allmine by rights.""Cards have had nothing to do with it.""Yes; they have. But they have had nothing to do with my being theeldest legitimate son of my father. The cards have been against me, butthey have not affected my mother. Then there came the blow from thegovernor, and where was I to look for my bread but to you? I suppose, ifthe truth be known, you get the money from the governor.""Of course I do. But not for your maintenance.""On what does he suppose that I have been living since last June? Itmayn't be in the bond, but I suppose he has made allowance for mymaintenance. Do you mean to say that I am not to have bread-and-cheeseout of Tretton?""If I were to turn you out of these rooms you'd find it very difficultto get it.""I don't think you'll do that.""I'm not so sure.""You're meditating it,--are you? I shouldn't go just at present, becauseI have not got a sovereign in the world. I was going to speak to youabout money. You must let me have some.""Upon my word, I like your impudence!""What the devil am I to do? The governor has asked me to go down toTretton, and I can't go without a five-pound note in my pocket.""The governor has asked you to Tretton?""Why not? I got a letter from him this morning." Then Augustus asked tosee the letter, but Mountjoy refused to show it. From this there aroseangry words, and Augustus told his brother that he did not believe him."Not believe me? You do believe me! You know that what I say is thetruth, He has asked me with all his usual soft soap. But I have refusedto go. I told him that I could not go to the house of one who hadinjured my mother so seriously."All that Mountjoy said as to the proposed visit to Tretton was true. Thesquire had written to him without mentioning the name of Augustus, andhad told him that, for the present, Tretton would be the best home forhim. "I will do what I can to make you happy, but you will not see acard," the squire had said. It was not the want of cards which preventedMountjoy, but a feeling on his part that for the future there could benothing but war between him and his father. It was out of the questionthat he should accept his father's hospitality without telling him ofhis intention, and he did not know his father well enough to feel thatsuch a declaration would not affect him at all. He had, therefore,declined.Then Harry Annesley's name was mentioned. "I think I've done for thatfellow," said Augustus."What have you done?""I've cooked his goose. In the first place, his uncle has stopped hisallowance, and in the second place the old fellow is going to marry awife. At any rate, he has quarrelled with Master Harry _a outrance_.Master Harry has gone back to the parental parsonage, and is thereeating the bread of affliction and drinking the waters of poverty.Flossy Mountjoy may marry him if she pleases. A girl may marry a man nowwithout leave from anybody. But if she does my dear cousin will havenothing to eat.""And you have done this?""'Alone I did it, boy.'""Then it's an infernal shame. What harm had he ever done you? For me Ihad some ground of quarrel with him, but for you there was none.""I have my own quarrel with him also.""I quarrelled with him--with a cause. I do not care if I quarrel withhim again. He shall never marry Florence Mountjoy if I can help it. Butto rob a fellow of his property I think a very shabby thing." ThenAugustus got up and walked out of the chambers into the street, andMountjoy soon followed him."I must make him understand that he must leave this at once," saidAugustus to himself, "and if necessary I must order the supplies to becut off."CHAPTER XXXVIII.THE SCARBOROUGH CORRESPONDENCE.It was as Mountjoy had said. The squire had written to him a letterinviting him to Tretton, and telling him that it would be the best homefor him till death should have put Tretton into other hands. Mountjoyhad thought the matter over, sitting in the easy-chair in his brother'sroom, and had at last declined the invitation. As his letter wasemblematic of the man, it may be as well to give it to the reader:"My dear father,--I don't think it will suit me to go down to Tretton atpresent. I don't mind the cards, and I don't doubt that you would makeit better than this place. But, to tell the truth, I don't believe aword of what you have told to the world about my mother, and some ofthese days I mean to have it out with Augustus. I shall not sit quietlyby and see Tretton taken out of my mouth. Therefore I think I had betternot go to Tretton."Yours truly,"MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH."This had not at all surprised the father, and had not in the leastangered him. He rather liked his son for standing up for his mother, andwas by no means offended at the expression of his son's incredulity. Butwhat was there in the prospect of a future lawsuit to prevent his soncoming to Tretton? There need be no word spoken as to the property.Tretton would be infinitely more comfortable than those rooms inVictoria Street, and he was aware that the hospitality of VictoriaStreet would not be given in an ungrudging spirit. "I shouldn't likeit," said the old squire to himself as he lay quiet on his sofa. "Ishouldn't like at all to be the humble guest of Augustus. Augustus wouldcertainly say a nasty word or two."The old man knew his younger son well, and he had known, too, thecharacter of his elder son; but he had not calculated enough on thechange which must have been made by such a revelation as he, his father,had made to him. Mountjoy had felt that all the world was against him,and that, as best he might, he would make use of all the world,excepting only his father, who of all the world was the falsest and themost cruel. As for his brother, he would bleed his brother to the verylast drop without any compunction. Every bottle of champagne that cameinto the house was, to Mountjoy's thinking, his own, bought with hismoney, and therefore fit to be enjoyed by him. But as for his father, hedoubted whether he could remain with his father without flying at histhroat.The old man decidedly preferred his elder son of the two. He had foundthat Augustus could not bear success, and had first come to dislike him,and then to hate him. What had he not done for Augustus? And with what areturn! No doubt Augustus had, till the spring of this present year,been kept in the background; but no injury had come to him from that.His father, of his own good will, with infinite labor and successfulingenuity, had struggled to put him back in the place which had beentaken from him. Augustus might, not unnaturally, have expressed himselfas angry. He had not done so but had made himself persistentlydisagreeable, and had continued to show that he was waiting impatientlyfor his father's death. It had come to pass that at their last meetinghe had hardly scrupled to tell his father that the world would be noworld for him till his father had left it. This was the reward which theold man received for having struggled to provide handsomely andluxuriously for his son! He still made his son a sufficient allowancebefitting the heir of a man of large property, but he had resolved neverto see him again. It was true that he almost hated him, and thoroughlydespised him.But since the departure and mysterious disappearance of his eldest sonhis regard for the sinner had returned. He had become apparently ahopeless gambler. His debts had been paid and repaid. At last thesquire had learned that Mountjoy owed so much on post-obits that thefarther payment of them was an impossibility. There was no way of savinghim. To save the property he must undo the doings of his early youth,and prove that the elder son was illegitimate. He had still kept theproofs, and he did it.To the great disgust of Mr. Grey, to the dismay of creditors, to theincredulous wonder of Augustus, and almost to the annihilation ofMountjoy himself, he had done it. But there had been nothing inMountjoy's conduct which had in truth wounded him. Mountjoy's vices hadbeen dangerous, destructive, absurdly foolish, but not, to his father, ashame. He ridiculed gambling as a source of excitement. No man could winmuch without dishonest practices, and fraud at cards would certainly bedetected. But he did not on that account hate cards. There was no reasonwhy Mountjoy should not become to him as pleasant a companion as everfor the few days that might be left to him, if only he would come. But,when asked, he refused to come. When the squire received the letterabove given he was not in the least angry with his son, but simplydetermined, if possible, that he should be brought to Tretton.Mountjoy's debts would now be paid, and something, if possible, shouldbe done for him. He was so angry with Augustus that he would, ifpossible, revoke his last decision;--but that, alas! would be impossible.Sir William Brodrick had, when he last saw him, expressed some hope,--notof his recovery, which was by all admitted to be impossible,--but of hiscontinuance in the land of the living for another three months, orperhaps six, as Sir William had finally suggested, opening out, as hehimself seemed to think, indefinite hope. "The most wonderfulconstitution, Mr. Scarborough, I ever saw in my life. I've never known adog even so cut about, and yet bear it." Mr. Scarborough bowed andsmiled, and accepted the compliment. He would have taken the hat off hishead, had it been his practice to wear a hat in his sitting-room. Mr.Merton had gone farther. Of course he did not mean, he said, to set uphis opinion against Sir William's; but if Mr. Scarborough would livestrictly by rule, Mr. Merton did not see why either three months or sixshould be the end of it. Mr. Scarborough had replied that he could notundertake to live precisely by rule, and Mr. Merton had shaken his head.But from that time forth Mr. Scarborough did endeavor to obey theinjunctions given to him. He had something worth doing in the six monthsnow offered to him.He had heard lately very much of the story of Harry Annesley, and hadexpressed great anger at the ill-usage to which that young man had beensubjected. It had come to his ears that it was intended that Harryshould lose the property he had expected, and that he had already losthis immediate income. This had come to him through Mr. Merton, betweenwhom and Augustus Scarborough there was no close friendship. And thesquire understood that Florence Mountjoy had been the cause of Harry'smisfortune. He himself recognized it as a fact that his son Mountjoy wasunfit to marry any young lady. Starvation would assuredly stare suchyoung lady in the face. But not the less was he acerbated and disgustedat the idea that Augustus should endeavor to take the young lady tohimself. "What!" he had exclaimed to Mr. Merton; "he wants both theproperty and the girl. There is nothing on earth that he does not want.The greater the impropriety in his craving, the stronger the craving."Then he picked up by degrees all the details of the midnight feudbetween Harry and Mountjoy, and set himself to work to undermineAugustus. But he had steadily carried out the plan for settling with thecreditors, and, with the aid of Mr. Grey, had, as he thought, alreadyconcluded that business. Conjunction with Augustus had been necessary,but that had been obtained.It is not too much to say that, at the present moment of his life, theidea of doing some injury to Augustus was the one object which exercisedMr. Scarborough's mind. Since he had fallen into business relations withhis younger son he had become convinced that a more detestable young mandid not exist. The reader will, perhaps, agree with Mr. Scarborough, butit can hardly be hoped that he should entertain the opinion as strongly.Augustus was now the recognized eldest legitimate son of the squire; andas the property was entailed it must no doubt belong to him. But thesquire was turning in his mind all means of depriving that condition asfar as was possible of its glory. When he had first heard of the injurythat had been done to Harry Annesley, he thought that he would leave toour hero all the furniture, all the gems, all the books, all the wine,all the cattle which were accumulated at Tretton. Augustus should havethe bare acres, and still barer house, but nothing else. In thinking ofthis he had been actuated by a conviction that it would be useless forhim to leave them to Mountjoy. Whatever might be left to Mountjoy wouldin fact be left to the creditors; and therefore Harry Annesley with hisinjuries had been felt to be a proper recipient, not of the squire'sbounty, but of the results of his hatred for his son.To run counter to the law! That had ever been the chief object of thesquire's ambition. To arrange everything so that it should be seen thathe had set all laws at defiance! That had been his great pride. He haddone so notably, and with astonishing astuteness, in reference to hiswife and two sons. But now there had come up a condition of things inwhich he could again show his cleverness. Augustus had been most anxiousto get up all the post-obit bonds which the creditors held, feeling, ashis father well understood, that he would thus prevent them from makingany farther inquiry when the squire should have died. Why should theystir in the matter by going to law when there would be nothing to begained? Those bonds had now been redeemed, and were in the possession ofMr. Grey. They had been bought up nominally by himself, and must begiven to him. Mr. Grey, at any rate, would have the proof that they hadbeen satisfied. They could not be used again to gratify any spite thatAugustus might entertain. The captain, therefore, could now enjoy anyproperty which might be left to him. Of course, it would all go to thegaming-table. It might even yet be better to leave it to Harry Annesley.But blood was thicker than water,--though it were but the blood of abastard. He would do a good turn for Harry in another way. All thefurniture, and all the gems, and all the money, should again be thefuture property of Mountjoy.But in order that this might be effected before he died he must not letthe grass grow under his feet. He thought of the promised three months,with a possible extension to six, as suggested by Sir William. "SirWilliam says three months," he said to Mr. Merton, speaking in theeasiest way of the possibility of his living."He said six.""Ah! that is, if I do what I'm told. But I shall not exactly do that.Three or six would be all the same, only for a little bit of business Iwant to get through. Sir William's orders would include the abandonmentof my business.""The less done the better. Then I do not see why Sir William shouldlimit you to six months.""I think that three will nearly suffice.""A man does not want to die, I suppose," said Merton."There are various ways of looking at that question," replied thesquire. "Many men desire the prolongation of life as a lengthened periodof enjoyment. There is, perhaps, something of that feeling with me; butwhen you see how far I am crippled and curtailed, how my enjoyments areconfined to breathing the air, to eating and drinking, and to theoccasional reading of a few pages, you must admit that there cannot bemuch of that. A conversation with you is the best of it. Some want tolive for the sake of their wives and children. In the ordinaryacceptation of the words, that is all over with me. Many desire to livebecause they fear to die. There is nothing of that in me, I can assureyou. I am not afraid to meet my Creator. But there are those who wishfor life that their purposes of love, or stronger purposes of hatred,may be accomplished. I am among the number. But, on that account, I onlywish it till those purposes have been completed. I think I'll go tosleep for an hour; but there are a couple of letters I want you to writebefore post-time." Then Mr. Scarborough turned himself round and thoughtof the letters he was to write. Mr. Merton went out, and as he wanderedabout the park in the dirt and slush of December tried to make up hismind whether he most admired his patron's philosophy or condemned hisgeneral lack of principle.At the proper hour he appeared again, and found Mr. Scarborough quitealert. "I don't know whether I shall have the three months, unless Ibehave better," he said. "I have been thinking about those letters, andvery nearly made an attempt to write them. There are things about a sonwhich a father doesn't wish to communicate to any one." Merton onlyshook his head. "I'm not a bit afraid of you, nor do I care for yourknowing what I have to say. But there are words which it would bedifficult even to write, and almost impossible to dictate." But he didmake the attempt, though he did not find himself able to say all that hehad intended. The first letter was to the lawyer:"My dear Mr. Grey,--You will be surprised at my writing to summon youonce again to my bedside. I think there was some kind of a promise madethat the request should not be repeated; but the circumstances are ofsuch a nature that I do not well know how to avoid it. However, if yourefuse to come, I will give you my instructions. It is my purpose tomake another will, and to leave everything that I am capable of leavingto my son Mountjoy. You are aware that he is now free from debt, andcapable of enjoying any property that he may possess. As circumstancesare at present he would on my death be absolutely penniless, and Heavenhelp the man who should find himself dependent on the mercy of AugustusScarborough."What I possess would be the balance at the bank, the house in town, andeverything contained in and about Tretton, as to which I should wishthat the will should be very explicit in making it understood that everyconceivable item of property is to belong to Mountjoy. I know thestrength of an entail, and not for worlds would I venture to meddle withanything so holy." There came a grin of satisfaction over his face as heuttered these words, and his scribe was utterly unable to keep fromlaughing. "But as Augustus must have the acres, let him have them bare.""Underscore that word, if you please;" and the word was underscored. "IfI had time I would have every tree about the place cut down.""I don't think you could under the entail," said Merton."I would use up every stick in building the farmers' barns and mendingthe farmers' gates, and I would cover an acre just in front of the housewith a huge conservatory. I respect the law, my boy, and they would findit difficult to prove that I had gone beyond it. But there is no timefor that kind of finished revenge."Then he went on with the letter: "You will understand what I mean. Iwish to divide my property so that Mountjoy may have everything that isnot strictly entailed. You will of course say that it will all go to thegambling-table. It may go to the devil, so that Augustus does not haveit. But it need not go to the gambling-table. If you would consent tocome down to me once more we might possibly devise some scheme forsaving it. But whether we can do so or not, it is my request that mylast will may be prepared in accordance with these instructions."Very faithfully yours,"JOHN SCARBOROUGH.""And now for the other," said Mr. Scarborough."Had you not better rest a bit?" asked Merton."No; this is a kind of work at which a man does not want to rest. He iscarried on by his own solicitudes and his own eagerness. This will bevery short, and when it is done then, perhaps, I may sleep."The second letter was as follows:"My dear Mountjoy,--I think you are foolish in allowing yourself to beprevented from coming here by a sentiment. But in truth, independentlyof the pleasure I should derive from your company, I wish you to be hereon a matter of business which is of some importance to yourself. I amabout to make a new will; and although I am bound to pay every respectto the entail, and would not for worlds do anything in opposition to thelaw, still I may be enabled to do something for your benefit. Yourbrother has kindly interfered for the payment of your creditors; and asall the outstanding bonds have been redeemed, you would now, by hisgenerosity, be enabled to enjoy any property which might be left to you.There are a few tables and chairs at my disposal, and a gem or two, andsome odd volumes which perhaps you might like to possess. I have writtento Mr. Grey on the subject, and I would wish you to see him. This youmight do, whether you come here or not. But I do not the less wish thatyou should come."Your affectionate father,"JOHN SCARBOROUGH.""I think that the odd volumes will fetch him. He was always fond ofliterature.""I suppose it means the entire library?" replied Merton."And he likes tables and chairs. I think he will come and look after thetables and chairs.""Why not beds and washhand-stands?" said Mr. Merton."Well, yes; he may have the beds and washhand-stands. Mountjoy is not afool, and will understand very well what I mean. I wonder whether Icould scrape the paper off the drawing-room walls, and leave the scrapsto his brother, without interfering with the entail? But now I am tired,and will rest."But he did not even then go to rest, but lay still scheming, scheming,scheming, about the property. There was now another letter to bewritten, for the writing of which he would not again summon Mr. Merton.He was half ashamed to do so, and at last sent for his sister. "Martha,"said he, "I want you to write a letter for me.""Mr. Merton has been writing letters for you all the morning.""That's just the reason why you should write one now. I am still in someslight degree afraid of his authority, but I am not at all afraid ofyours.""You ought to be quiet, John; indeed you ought.""And, in order that I may be quiet, you must write this letter. It'snothing particular, or I should not have asked you to do it. It's onlyan invitation.""An invitation to ask somebody here?""Yes; to ask somebody to come here. I don't know whether he'll come.""Do I know him?""I hope you may, if he comes. He's a very good-looking young man, ifthat is anything.""Don't talk nonsense, John.""But I believe he's engaged to another young lady, with whom I must begyou not to interfere. You remember Florence?""Florence Mountjoy? Of course I remember my own niece.""The young man is engaged to her.""She was intended for poor Mountjoy.""Poor Mountjoy has put himself beyond all possibility of a wife.""Poor Mountjoy!"--and the soft-hearted aunt almost shed tears."But we haven't to do with Mountjoy now. Sit down there and begin. 'DearMr. Annesley--'""Oh! It's Mr. Annesley, is it?""Yes, it is. Mr. Annesley is the handsome young man. Have you anyobjection?""Only people do say--""What do they say?""Of course I don't know; only I have heard--""That he is a scoundrel!""Scoundrel is very strong," said the old lady, shocked."A villain, a liar, a thief, and all the rest of it. That's what youhave heard. And I'll tell you who has been your informant. Either firstor second hand, it has come to you from Mr. Augustus Scarborough. Nowwe'll begin again. 'Dear Mr. Annesley--'" The old lady paused a moment,and then, setting herself firmly to the task, commenced and finished herletter, as follows:"Dear Mr. Annesley,--You spent a few days here on one occasion, and Iwant to renew the pleasure which your visit gave me. Will you extendyour kindness so far as to come to Tretton for any time you may pleaseto name beyond two or three days? I am sorry to say that your friendAugustus Scarborough cannot be here to meet you. My other son, Mountjoy,may be here. If you wish to escape him, I will endeavor so to fix thetime when I shall have heard from you. But I think there need be no illblood there. Neither of you did anything of which you are, probably,ashamed; though as an old man I am bound to express my disapproval."("Surely he must be ashamed," said Miss Scarborough."Never you mind. Believe me, you know nothing about it." Then he went onwith his letter.)"But it is not merely for the pleasure of your society that I ask you. Ihave a word to say to you which may be important. Yours faithfully,"JOHN SCARBOROUGH."CHAPTER XXXIX.HOW THE LETTERS WERE RECEIVED.We must now describe the feelings of Mr. Scarborough's correspondents asthey received his letters. When Mr. Grey begun to read that which wasaddressed to him he declared that on no consideration would he go downto Tretton. But when he came to inquire within himself as to hisobjection he found that it lay chiefly in his great dislike to AugustusScarborough. For poor Mountjoy, as he called him, he entertained afeeling of deep pity,--and pity we know, is akin to love. And for thesquire, he in his heart felt but little of that profound dislike whichhe was aware such conduct as the squire's ought to have generated. "Heis the greatest rascal that I ever knew," he said again and again, bothto Dolly and to Mr. Barry. But yet he did not regard him as an honestman regards a rascal, and was angry with himself in consequence. He knewthat there remained with him even some spark of love for Mr.Scarborough, which to himself was inexplicable. From the moment in whichhe had first admitted the fact that Augustus Scarborough was the trueheir-at-law, he had been most determined in taking care that thatheirship should be established. It must be known to all men thatMountjoy was not the eldest son of his father, as the law required himto be for the inheritance of the property, and that Augustus was theeldest son; but in arranging that these truths should be notorious ithad come to pass that he had learned to hate Augustus with an intensitythat had redounded to the advantage both of Mountjoy and their father.It must be so. Augustus must become Augustus Scarborough, Esquire, ofTretton,--but the worse luck for Tretton and all connected with it. AndMr. Grey did resolve that, when that day should come, all relationbetween himself and Tretton should cease.It had never occurred to him that, by redeeming the post-obit bonds,Mountjoy would become capable of owning and enjoying any property thatmight be left to him. With Tretton, all the belongings of Tretton, inthe old-fashioned way, would, of course, go to the heir. The belongingsof Tretton, which were personal property, would, in themselves, amountto wealth for a younger son. That which Mr. Scarborough would in thisway be able to bequeath might, probably, be worth thirty thousandpounds. Out of the proceeds of the real property the debts had beenpaid. And because Augustus had consented so to pay them he was now to bemulcted of those loose belongings which gave its charm to Tretton!Because Augustus had paid Mountjoy's debts Mountjoy was to be enabled torob Augustus! There was a wickedness in this redolent of the old squire.But it was a wickedness in arranging which Mr. Grey hesitated toparticipate. As he thought of it, however, he could not but feel what avery clever man he had for a client."It will all go to the gambling-table, of course," he said that night toDolly."It is no affair of ours.""No; but when a lawyer is consulted he has to think of the prudent orimprudent disposition of property.""Mr. Scarborough hasn't consulted you, papa.""I must look at it as though he had. He tells me what he intends to do,and I am bound to give him my advice. I cannot advise him to bestow allthese things on Augustus, whom I regard as a long way the worst of thefamily.""You need not care about that.""And here, again," continued Mr. Grey, "comes up the question,--what isit that duty demands? Augustus is the eldest son, and is entitled towhat the law allots him; but Mountjoy was brought up as the eldest son,and is certainly entitled to what provision the father can make him.""You cannot provide for such a gambler.""I don't know that that comes within my duty. It is not my fault thatMountjoy is a gambler, any more than that it is my fault that Augustusis a beast. Gambler and beast, there they are. And, moreover, nothingwill turn the squire from his purpose. I am only a tool in his hands,--atrowel for the laying of his mortar and bricks. Of course I must drawhis will, and shall do it with some pleasure, because it will dispossessAugustus."Then Mr. Grey went to bed, as did also Dolly; but she was not at allsurprised at being summoned to his couch after she had been an hour inher own bed."I think I shall go down to Tretton," said Mr. Grey."You declared that you would never go there again.""So I did; but I did not know then how much I might come to hateAugustus Scarborough.""Would you go to Tretton merely to injure him?" said his daughter."I have been thinking about that," said Mr. Grey. "I don't know that Iwould go simply to do him an injury; but I think that I would go to seethat justice is properly done.""That can be arranged without your going to Tretton.""By putting our heads together I think we can contrive that the deedshall be more effectually performed. What we must attempt to do is tosave this property from going to the gambling-table. There is only oneway that occurs to me.""What is that?""It must be left to his wife.""He hasn't a wife.""It must be left to some woman whom he will consent to marry. There arethree objects:--to keep it from Augustus; to give the enjoyment of it toMountjoy; and to prevent Mountjoy from gambling with it. The only thingI can see is a wife.""There is a girl he wants to marry," said Dolly."But she doesn't want to marry him, and I doubt whether he can be got tomarry any one else. There is still a peck of difficulties.""Oh, papa, I wish you would wash your hands of the Scarboroughs.""I must go to Tretton first," said he. "And now, my dear, you are doingno good by sitting up here and talking to me." Then, with a smile, Dollytook herself off to her own chamber.Mountjoy, when he got his letter, was sitting over a late breakfast inVictoria Street. It was near twelve o'clock, and he was enjoying thedelicious luxury of having his breakfast to eat, with a cigar after it,and nothing else that he need do. But the fruition of all these comfortswas somewhat marred by the knowledge that he had no such dinner toexpect. He must go out and look for a dinner among the eating-houses.The next morning would bring him no breakfast, and if he were to remainlonger in Victoria Street he must do so in direct opposition to theowner of the establishment. He had that morning received notice to quit,and had been told that the following breakfast would be the last mealserved to him. "Let it be good of its kind," Mountjoy had said."I believe you care for nothing but eating and drinking.""There's little else that you can do for me." And so they had parted.Mountjoy had taken the precaution of having his letters addressed to thehouse of the friendly bootmaker; and now, as he was slowly pouring outhis first cup of coffee, and thinking how nearly it must be his last,his father's letter was brought to him. The letter had been delayed oneday, as he himself had omitted to call for it. It was necessarily a sadtime for him. He was a man who fought hard against melancholy, taking itas a primary rule of life that, for such a one as he had become, thepleasures of the immediate moment should suffice. If one day, or betterstill, one night of excitement was in store for him, the next day shouldbe regarded as the unlimited future, for which no man can beresponsible. But such philosophy will too frequently be insufficient forthe stoutest hearts. Mountjoy's heart would occasionally almost giveway, and then his thoughts would be dreary enough. Hunger, absolutehunger, without the assured expectation of food, had never yet come uponhim; but in order to put a stop to its cravings, if he should find ittroublesome to bear, he had already provided himself with pistol andbullets.And now, with his cup of coffee before him, aromatic, creamy, and hot,with a filleted sole rolled up before him on a little dish, three orfour plover's eggs, on which to finish, lying by, and, on the distanceof the table, a chasse of brandy, of which he already well knew thevirtues, he got his father's letter. He did not at first open it,disliking all thoughts as to his father. Then gradually he tore theenvelope, and was slow in understanding the full meaning of the lastlines. He did not at once perceive the irony of "his brother's kindlyinterference," and of the "generosity" which had enabled him, Mountjoy,to be a recipient of property. But his father purposed to do somethingfor his benefit. Gradually it dawned upon him that his father could onlydo that something effectually because of his brother's dealings with thecreditors.Then the chairs and the tables, and the gem or two, and the oddvolumes, one by one, made themselves intelligible. That a father shouldwrite so to one son, and should so write of another, was marvellous. Butthen his father was a marvellous man, whose character he was onlybeginning to understand. His father, he told himself, had, fortunately,taken it into his head to hate Augustus, and intended, in consequence,to strip Tretton and the property generally of all their outsidepersonal belongings.Yes; he thought that, with such an object before him, he would certainlygo and see Mr. Grey. And if Mr. Grey should so advise him he would godown to Tretton. On such business as this he would consent to see hisfather. He did not think that just at present he need have recourse tohis pistol for his devices. He could not on the very day go to Tretton,as it would be necessary that he should write to his father first. Hisbrother would probably extend his hospitality for a couple of days whenhe should hear of the proposed journey, and, if not, would lend himmoney for his present purposes, or under existing circumstances he mightprobably be able to borrow it from Mr. Grey. With a heart elevated toalmost absolute bliss he ate his breakfast, and drank his chasse, andsmoked his cigar, and then rose slowly, that he might proceed to Mr.Grey's chambers. But at this moment Augustus came in. He had onlybreakfasted at his own club, much less comfortably than he would havedone at home, in order that he might not sit at table with his brother.He had now returned so that he might see to Mountjoy's departure. "Afterall, Augustus, I am going down to Tretton," said the elder brother as hefolded up his father's letter."What argument has the old man used now?" Mountjoy did not think it wellto tell his brother the exact nature of the arguments used, andtherefore put the letter into his pocket."He wishes to say something to me about property," said Mountjoy.Then some idea of the old squire's scheme fell with a crushing weight ofanticipated sorrow on Augustus. In a moment it all occurred to him whathis father might do, what injuries he might inflict; and,--saddest of allfeelings,--there came the immediate reflection that it had all beenrendered possible by his own doings. With the conviction that so muchmight be left away from him, there came also a farther feeling that,after all, there was a chance that his father had invented the story ofhis brother's illegitimacy, that Mountjoy was now free from debt, andthat Tretton, with all its belongings, might now go back to him. Thathis father would do it if it were possible he did not doubt. From weekto week he had waited impatiently for his father's demise, and hadexpected little or none of that mental activity which his father hadexercised. "What a fool he had been," he said to himself, sittingopposite to Mountjoy, who in the vacancy of the moment had lightedanother cigar; "what an ass!" Had he played his cards better, had hecomforted and flattered and cosseted the old man, Mountjoy might havegone his own way to the dogs. Now, at the best, Tretton would come tohim stripped of everything; and,--at the worst,--no Tretton would come tohim at all. "Well, what are you going to do?" he said, roughly."I think I shall, probably, go down and just see the governor.""All your feelings about your mother, then, are blown to the winds?""My feelings about your mother are not blown to the winds at all; but tospeak of her to you would be wasting breath.""I hadn't the pleasure of knowing her," said Augustus. "And I am notaware that she did me any great kindness in bringing me into the world.Do you go to Tretton this afternoon?""Probably not.""Or to-morrow?""Possibly to-morrow," said Mountjoy."Because I shall find it convenient to have your room.""To-day, of course, I cannot stir. To-morrow morning I should, at anyrate, like to have my breakfast." Here he paused for a reply, but nonecame from his brother. "I must have some money to go down to Trettonwith; I suppose you can lend it me just for the present?""Not a shilling," said Augustus, in thorough ill-humor."I shall be able to pay you very shortly.""Not a shilling. The return I have had from you for all that I have doneis not of a nature to make me do more.""If I had ever thought that you had expended a sovereign except for theobject of furthering some plot of your own, I should have been grateful.As it is I do not know that we owe very much to each other." Then heleft the room, and, getting into a cab, went away to Lincoln's Inn.Harry Annesley received Mr. Scarborough's letter down at Buston, and wasmuch surprised by it. He had not spent the winter hitherto verypleasantly. His uncle he had never seen, though he had heard from dayto day sundry stories of his wooing. He had soon given up his hunting,feeling himself ashamed, in his present nameless position, to rideJoshua Thoroughbung's horses. He had taken to hard reading, but the hardreading had failed, and he had been given up to the miseries of hisposition. The hard reading had been continued for a fortnight or threeweeks, during which he had, at any rate, respected himself, but in anevil hour he had allowed it to escape from him, and now was againmiserable. Then the invitation from Tretton had been received. "I havegot a letter; 'tis from Mr. Scarborough of Tretton.""What does Mr. Scarborough say?""He wants me to go down there.""Do you know Mr. Scarborough? I believe you have altogether quarrelledwith his son?""Oh yes; I have quarrelled with Augustus, and have had an encounter withMountjoy not on the most friendly terms. But the father and Mountjoyseem to be reconciled. You can see his letter. I, at any rate, shall gothere." To this Mr. Annesley senior had no objection to make.CHAPTER XL.VISITORS AT TRETTON.It so happened that the three visitors who had been asked to Tretton allagreed to go on the same day. There was, indeed, no reason why Harryshould delay his visit, and much why the other two should expeditetheirs. Mr. Grey knew that the thing, if done at all, should be done atonce; and Mountjoy, as he had agreed to accept his father's offer, couldnot put himself too quickly under the shelter of his father's roof. "Youcan have twenty pounds," Mr. Grey had said when the subject of the moneywas mooted. "Will that suffice?" Mountjoy had said that it would sufficeamply, and then, returning to his brother's rooms, had waited there withwhat patience he possessed till he sallied forth to The Continental toget the best dinner which that restaurant could afford him. He wasbeginning to feel that his life was very sad in London, and to lookforward to the glades of Tretton with some anticipation of ruraldelight.He went down by the same train with Mr. Grey,--"a great grind," asMountjoy called it, when Mr. Grey proposed a departure at ten o'clock.Harry followed so as to reach Tretton only in time for dinner. "If I mayventure to advise you," said Mr. Grey in the train, "I should do in thismatter whatever my father asked me." Hereupon Mountjoy frowned. "He isanxious to make some provision for you.""I'm not grateful to my father, if you mean that.""It is hard to say whether you should be grateful. But, from the first,he has done the best he could for you, according to his lights.""You believe all this about my mother?""I do.""I don't. That's the difference. And I don't think that Augustusbelieves it.""The story is undoubtedly true.""You must excuse me if I will not accept it.""At any rate, you had parted with your share in the property.""My share was the whole.""After your father's death," said Mr. Grey; "and that was gone.""We needn't discuss the property. What is it that he expects me to donow?""Simply to be kind in your manner to him, and to agree to what he saysabout the personal property. It is his intention, as far as I understandit, to leave you everything.""He is very kind.""I think he is.""Only it would all have been mine if he had not cheated me of mybirthright.""Or Mr. Tyrrwhit's, and Mr. Hart's, and Mr. Spicer's.""Mr. Tyrrwhit, and Mr. Hart, and Mr. Spicer could not have robbed me ofmy name. Let them have done what they would with their bonds, I shouldhave been, at any rate, Scarborough of Tretton. My belief is that I neednot blush for my mother. He has made it appear that I should do so. Ican't forgive him because he gives me the chairs and tables.""They will be worth thirty thousand pounds," said Mr. Grey."I can't forgive him."The cloud sat very black upon Mountjoy Scarborough's face as he saidthis, and the blacker it sat the more Mr. Grey liked him. If somethingcould be done to redeem from ruin a young man who so felt about hismother,--who so felt about his mother simply because she had been hismother,--it would be a good thing to do. Augustus had entertained nosuch feeling. He had said to Mr. Grey, as he had said also to hisbrother, that "he had not known the lady." When the facts as to thedistribution of the property had been made known to him he had carednothing for the injury done by the story to his mother's name. The storywas too true. Mr. Grey knew that it was true; but he could not on thataccount do other than feel an intense desire to confer some benefit onMountjoy Scarborough. He put his hand out affectionately and laid it onthe other man's knee. "Your father has not long to live, CaptainScarborough.""I suppose not.""And he is at present anxious to make what reparation is in his power.What he can leave you will produce, let us say, fifteen hundred a year.Without a will from him you would have to live on your brother'sbounty.""By Heaven, no!" said Mountjoy, thinking of the pistol and the bullets."I see nothing else.""I see, but I cannot explain.""Do you not think that fifteen hundred a year would be better thannothing,--with a wife, let us say?" said Mr. Grey, beginning to introducethe one argument on which he believed so much must depend."With a wife?""Yes; with a wife.""With what wife? A wife may be very well, but a wife must depend on whoit is. Is there any one that you mean?""Not exactly any particular person," said the lawyer, lamely."Pshaw! What do I want with a wife? Do you mean to say that my fatherhas told you that he intends to clog his legacy with the burden of awife? I would not accept it with such a burden,--unless I could choosethe wife myself. To tell the truth, there is a girl--""Your cousin?""Yes; my cousin. When I was well-to-do in the world I was taught tobelieve that I could have her. If she will be mine, Mr. Grey, I willrenounce gambling altogether. If my father can manage that I willforgive him,--or will endeavor to do so. The property which he can leaveme shall be settled altogether upon her. I will endeavor to reformmyself, and so to live that no misfortune shall come upon her. If thatis what you mean, say so.""Well, not quite that.""To no other marriage will I agree. That has been the dream of my lifethrough all those moments of hot excitement and assured despair which Ihave endured. Her mother has always told me that it should be so, andshe herself in former days did not deny it. Now you know it all. If myfather wishes to see me married, Florence Mountjoy must be my wife."Then he sunk back on his seat, and nothing more was said between themtill they had reached Tretton.The father and son had not met each other since the day on which theformer had told the latter the story of his birth. Since then Mountjoyhad disappeared from the world, and for a few days his father hadthought that he had been murdered. But now they met as they might havedone had they seen each other a week ago. "Well, Mountjoy, how are you?"And, "How are you, sir?" Such were the greetings between them. And noothers were spoken. In a few minutes the son was allowed to go and lookafter the rural joys he had anticipated, and the lawyer was leftcloseted with the squire.Mr. Grey soon explained his proposition. Let the property be left totrustees who should realize from it what money it should fetch, and keepthe money in their own hands, paying Mountjoy the income. "There could,"he said, "be nothing better done, unless Mountjoy would agree to marry.He is attached, it seems, to his cousin," said Mr. Grey, "and he isunwilling at present to marry any one else.""He can't marry her," said the squire."I do not know the circumstances.""He can't marry her. She is engaged to the young man who will be herejust now. I told you,--did I not?--that Harry Annesley is coming here. Myson knows that he will be here to-day.""Everybody knows the story of Mr. Annesley and the captain.""They are to sit down to dinner together, and I trust they may notquarrel. The lady of whom you are speaking is engaged to young Annesley,and Mountjoy's suit in that direction is hopeless.""Hopeless, you think?""Utterly hopeless. Your plan of providing him with a wife would be verygood if it were feasible. I should be very glad to see him settled. Butif he will marry no one but Florence Mountjoy he must remain unmarried.Augustus has had his hand in that business, and don't let us dabble init." Then the squire gave the lawyer full instructions as to the willwhich was to be made. Mr. Grey and Mr. Bullfist were to be named astrustees, with instructions to sell everything which it would be in thesquire's legal power to bequeath. The books, the gems, the furniture,both at Tretton and in London, the plate, the stock, the farm-produce,the pictures on the walls, and the wine in the cellars, were all named.He endeavored to persuade Mr. Grey to consent to a cutting of thetimber, so that the value of it might be taken out of the pocket of theyounger brother and put into that of the elder. But to this Mr. Greywould not assent. "There would be an air of persecution about it," hesaid, "and it mustn't be done." But to the general stripping of Trettonfor the benefit of Mountjoy he gave a cordial agreement."I am not quite sure that I have done with Augustus as yet," said thesquire. "I had made up my mind not to be put out by trifles; not to bevexed at a little. My treatment of my children has been such that,though I have ever intended to do them good, I must have seemed to eachat different periods to have injured him. I have not, therefore,expected much from them. But I have received less than nothing fromAugustus. It is possible that he may hear from me again." To this Mr.Grey said nothing, but he had taken his instructions about the drawingof the will.Harry came down by the train in time for dinner. On the journey down hehad been perplexed in his mind, thinking of various things. He did notquite understand why Mr. Scarborough had sent for him. His formerintimacy had been with Augustus, and though there had been somecordiality of friendship shown by the old man to the son's companion, ithad amounted to no more than might be expected from one who was notablygood-natured. A great injury had been done to Harry, and he supposedthat his visit must have some reference to that injury. He had been toldin so many words that, come when he might, he would not find Augustus atTretton. From this and from other signs he almost saw that there existeda quarrel between the squire and his son. Therefore he felt thatsomething was to be said as to the state of his affairs at Buston.But if, as the train drew near to Tretton, he was anxious as to hismeeting with the squire, he was much more so as to the captain. Thereader will remember all the circumstances under which they two had lastseen each other Harry had been furiously attacked by Mountjoy, and hadthen left him sprawling,--dead, as some folks had said on the followingday,--under the rail. His only crime had been that he was drunk. If thedisinherited one would give him his hand and let by-gones be by-gones,he would do the same. He felt no personal animosity. But there was adifficulty.As he was driven up to the door in a cab belonging to the squire therewas Mountjoy, standing before the house. He too had thought of thedifficulties, and had made up his mind that it would not do for him tomeet his late foe without some few words intended for the making ofpeace. "I hope you are well, Mr. Annesley," he said, offering his handas the other got out of the cab. "It may be as well that I shouldapologize at once for my conduct. I was at that moment considerablydistressed, as you may have heard. I had been declared to be penniless,and to be nobody. The news had a little unmanned me, and I was besidemyself.""I quite understand it; quite understand it," said Annesley, giving hishand. "I am very glad to see you back again, and in your father'shouse." Then Mountjoy turned on his heel, and went through the hall,leaving Harry to the care of the butler. The captain thought that he haddone enough, and that the affair in the street might now be regarded asa dream. Harry was taken up to shake hands with the old man, and in duetime came down to dinner, where he met Mr. Grey and the young doctor.They were all very civil to him, and upon the whole, he spent a pleasantevening. On the next day, about noon, the squire sent for him. He hadbeen told at breakfast that it was the squire's intention to see him inthe middle of the day, and he had been unable, therefore, to joinMountjoy's shooting-party."Sit down, Mr. Annesley," said the old man. "You were surprised, nodoubt, when you got my invitation?""Well, yes; perhaps so; but I thought it very kind.""I meant to be kind; but still, it requires some explanation. You see, Iam such an old cripple that I cannot give invitations like anybody else.Now you are here I must not eat and drink with you, and in order to saya few words to you I am obliged to keep you in the house till the doctortells me I am strong enough to talk.""I am glad to find you so much better than when I was here before.""I don't know much about that. There will never be a 'much better' inmy case. The people about me talk with the utmost unconcern of whether Ican live one month or possibly two. Anything beyond that is quite out ofthe question." The squire took a pride in making the worst of his case,so that the people to whom he talked should marvel the more at hisvitality. "But we won't mind my health now. It is true, I fear, that youhave quarrelled with your uncle.""It is quite true that he has quarrelled with me.""I am afraid that that is more important. He means, if he can, to cutyou out of the entail.""He does not mean that I shall have the property if he can prevent it.""I don't think very much of entails myself," said the squire. "If a manhas a property he should be able to leave it as he pleases; or--or elsehe doesn't have it.""That is what the law intends, I suppose," said Harry."Just so; but the law is such an old woman that she never knows how toexpress herself to any purpose. I haven't allowed the law to bind me. Idare say you know the story.""About your two sons,--and the property? I think all the world knows thestory.""I suppose it has been talked about a little," said the squire, with achuckle. "My object has been to prevent the law from handing over myproperty to the fraudulent claims which my son's creditors were enabledto make, and I have succeeded fairly well. On that head I have nothingto regret. Now your uncle is going to take other means.""Yes; he is going to take means which, are, at any rate, lawful.""But which will be tedious, and may not, perhaps, succeed. He isintending to have an heir of his own.""That I believe is his purpose," said Harry."There is no reason why he shouldn't;--but he mayn't, you know.""He is not married yet.""No;--he is not married yet. And then he has also stopped the allowancehe used to make you." Harry nodded assent. "Now, all this is a greatshame.""I think so.""The poor gentleman has been awfully bamboozled.""He is not so very old," said Harry, "I don't think he is more thanfifty.""But he is an old goose. You'll excuse me, I know. Augustus Scarboroughgot him up to London, and filled him full of lies.""I am aware of it.""And so am I aware of it. He has told him stories as to your conductwith Mountjoy which, added to some youthful indiscretions of your own--""It was simply because I didn't like to hear him read sermons.""That was an indiscretion, as he had the power in his hands to do you aninjury. Most men have got some little bit of petty tyranny in theirhearts. I have had none." To this Harry could only bow. "I let my twoboys do as they pleased, only wishing that they should lead happy lives.I never made them listen to sermons, or even to lectures. Probably I waswrong. Had I tyrannized over them, they would not have tyrannized overme as they have done. Now I'll tell you what it is that I propose to do.I will write to your uncle, or will get Mr. Merton to write for me, andwill explain to him, as well as I can, the depth, and the blackness, andthe cruelty,--the unfathomable, heathen cruelty, together with thefalsehoods, the premeditated lies, and the general rascality on allsubjects,--of my son Augustus. I will explain to him that, of all men Iknow, he is the least trustworthy. I will explain to him that, if led ina matter of such importance by Augustus Scarborough, he will be surelyled astray. And I think that between us,--between Merton and me, thatis,--we can concoct a letter that shall be efficacious. But I will getMountjoy also to go and see him, and explain to him out of his own mouthwhat in truth occurred that night when he and you fell out in thestreets. Mr. Prosper must be a more vindictive man than I take him to bein regard to sermons if he will hold out after that." Then Mr.Scarborough allowed him to go out, and if possible find the shooterssomewhere about the park.CHAPTER XLI.MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH GOES TO BUSTON.Mr. Grey returned to London after staying but one night, having receivedfresh instructions as to the will. The will was to be prepared at once,and Mr. Barry was to bring it down for execution. "Shall I not informAugustus?" asked Mr. Grey.But this did not suit with Mr. Scarborough's views of revenge. "I thinknot. I would do by him whatever honesty requires; but I have never toldhim that I mean to leave him anything. Of course he knows that he is tohave the estate. He is revelling in the future poverty of poor Mountjoy.He turned him out of his house just now because Mountjoy would not obeyhim by going to--Brazil. He would turn him out of this house if he couldbecause I won't at once go--to the devil. He is something overmasterful,is Master Augustus, and a rub or two will do him good. I'd rather youwouldn't tell him, if you please." Then Mr. Grey departed, withoutmaking any promise, but he determined that he would be guided by thesquire's wishes. Augustus Scarborough was not of a nature to excite verywarmly the charity of any man.Harry remained for two or three days' shooting with Mountjoy, and onceor twice he saw the squire again. "Merton and I have managed to concoctthat letter," said the squire. "I'm afraid your uncle will find itrather long. Is he impatient of long letters?""He likes long sermons.""If anybody will listen to his reading. I think you have a deal toanswer for yourself, when you could not make so small a sacrifice to theman to whom you were to owe everything. But he ought to look for a wifein consequence of that crime, and not falsely allege another. If, as Ifear, he finds the wife-plan troublesome, our letter may perhaps movehim, and Mountjoy is to go down and open his eyes. Mountjoy hasn't madeany difficulty about it.""I shall be greatly distressed--" Harry begun."Not at all. He must go. I like to have my own way in these littlematters. He owes you as much reparation as that, and we shall be able tosee what members of the Scarborough family you would trust the most."Harry, during the two days, shot some hares in company with Mountjoy,but not a word more was said about the adventure in London. Nor was thename of Florence Mountjoy ever mentioned between the two suitors. "I'mgoing to Buston, you know," Mountjoy said once."So your father told me.""What sort of a fellow shall I find your uncle?""He's a gentleman, but not very wise." No more was said between them onthat head, but Mountjoy spoke at great length about his own brother andhis father's will."My father is the most singular man you ever came across.""I think he is.""I am not going to say a good word for him. I wouldn't let him thinkthat I had said a good word for him. In order to save the property hehas maligned my mother, and has cheated me and the creditors mosthorribly--most infernally. That's my conviction, though Grey thinksotherwise. I can't forgive him,--and won't; and he knows it. But afterthat he is going to do the best thing he can for me. And he has begun bymaking me a decent allowance again as his son. But I'm to have that onlyas long as I remain here at Tretton. Of course I have been fond ofcards.""I suppose so.""Not a doubt of it. But I haven't touched a card now for a month nearly.And then he is going to leave me what property he has to leave. And heand my brother have paid off those Jews among them. I'm not a bitobliged to my brother. He's got some game of his own which I don't quiteclearly see, and my father is doing this for me simply to spite mybrother. He'd cut down every tree upon the place if Grey would allow it.And yet, to give Augustus the property, my father has done this grossinjustice.""I suppose the money-lenders would have had the best of it had he not.""That's true. They would have had it all. They had measured every yardof it, and had got my name down for the full value. Now they're paid.""That's a comfort.""Nothing's a comfort. I know that they're right, and that if I got themoney into my own hand it would be gone to-morrow. I should be off toMonte Carlo like a shot; and, of course it would go after the other.There is but one thing would redeem me.""What's that?""Never mind. We won't talk of it." Then he was silent, but HarryAnnesley knew very well that he had alluded to Florence Mountjoy.Then Harry went, and Mountjoy was left to the companionship of Mr.Merton, and such pleasure as he could find in a daily visit to hisfather. He was, at any rate, courteous in his manner to the old man, andabstained from those irritating speeches which Augustus had alwayschosen to make. He had on one occasion during this visit told his fatherwhat he thought about him, but this the squire had taken quite as acompliment."I believe, you know, that you've done a monstrous injustice toeverybody concerned.""I rather like doing what you call injustices.""You have set the law at defiance.""Well, yes; I think I have done that.""According to my belief, it's all untrue.""You mean about your mother. I like you for that; I do, indeed. I likeyou for sticking up for your poor mother. Well, now you shall have fiftypounds a month,--say twelve pounds ten a week,--as long as you remain atTretton, and you may have whom you like here, as long as they bring nocards with them. And if you want to hunt there are horses, and if theyain't good enough you can get others. But if you go away from Trettonthere's an end of it. It will all be stopped the next day."Nevertheless, he did make arrangements by which Mountjoy should proceedto Buston, stopping two nights as he went to London. "There isn't a clubhe can enter," said the squire, comforting himself, "nor a Jew that willlend him a five-pound note."Mountjoy had told the truth when he had said that nothing was a comfort.Though it seemed to his father and to the people around him at Trettonthat he had everything that a man could want, he had, in fact,nothing,--nothing to satisfy him. In the first place, he was quite aliveto the misery of that decision given by the world against him, which hadbeen of such comfort to his father. Not a club in London would admithim. He had been proclaimed a defaulter after such a fashion that allhis clubs had sent to him for some explanation; and as he had givennone, and had not answered their letters, his name had been crossed outin the books of them all. He knew himself to be a man disgraced, andwhen he had fled from London he had gone under the conviction that hewould certainly never return. There were the pistol and bullet as hislast assured resource; but a certain amount of good-fortune had awaitedhim,--enough to save him from having recourse to their aid. His brotherhad supplied him with small sums of money, and from time to time amorsel of good luck had enabled him to gamble, not to his heart'scontent, but still in some manner so as to make his life bearable. Butnow he was back in his own country, and he could gamble not at all, andhardly even see those old companions with whom he had lived. It was notonly for the card-tables that he sighed, but for the companions of thecard-table. And though he knew that he had been scratched out from thelists of all clubs as a dishonest man, he knew also, or thought that heknew, that he had been as honest as the best of those companions. Aslong as he could by any possibility raise money he had paid it away,and by no false trick had he ever endeavored to get it back again.Had a little time been allowed him all would have been paid; and all hadbeen paid. He knew that by the rules of such institutions time could notbe granted; but still he did not feel himself to have been a dishonestman. Yet he had been so disgraced that he could hardly venture to walkabout the streets of London in the daylight. And then there came uponhim, when he found himself alone at Tretton, an irrepressible desire forgambling. It was as though his throat were parched with an implacablethirst. He walked about ever meditating certain fortunate turns of thecards; and when he had worked himself up to some realization of his oldexcitement he would remember that it was all a vain and empty bubble. Hehad money in his pocket, and could rush up to London if he would, and ifhe did so he could, no doubt, find some coarse hell at which he couldstake it till it would be all gone; but the gates of the A---- and theB---- and the C---- would be closed against him; and he would then bedriven to feel that he had indeed fallen into the nethermost pit. Werehe once to play at such places as his mind painted to him he could neverplay at any other; and yet when the day drew nigh on which he was to goto London, on his way to Buston, he did bethink himself where theseplaces were to be found. His throat was parched, and the thirst upon himwas extreme. Cards were the weapons he had used. He had played ecarte,piquet, whist, and baccarat, with an occasional night of some foolishgame such as cribbage or vingt-et-un. Though he had always lost, he hadalways played with men who had played honestly. There is much that is,in truth, dishonest even in honest play. A man who can keep himselfsober after dinner plays with one who flusters himself with drink. Theman with a trained memory plays with him who cannot remember a card. Thecool man plays with the impetuous; the man who can hold his tongue withhim who cannot but talk; the man whose practised face will tell nosecrets with him who loses a point every rubber by his uncontrolledgrimaces. And then there is the man who knows the game, and plays withhim who knows it not at all. Of course, the cool, the collected, thethoughtful, the practised,--they who have given up their whole souls tothe study of cards,--will play at a great advantage, which in theircalculations they do not fail to recognize. See the man standing by andwatching the table, and leaving all the bets he can on A and B as againstC and D; and, however ignorant you may be, you will soon become surethat A and B know the game, whereas C and D are simply infants. That isall fair and acknowledged; but looking at it from a distance, as you lieunder your apple-trees in your orchard, far from the shout of "Two byhonors," you will come to doubt the honesty of making your income aftersuch a fashion.Such as it is, Mountjoy sighed for it bitterly,--sighed for it, but couldnot see where it was to be found. He had a gentleman's horror of thoseresorts in gin-shops, or kept by the disciples of gin-shops, where hewould surely be robbed,--which did not appal him,--but robbed in badcompany. Thinking of all this, he went up to London late in theafternoon, and spent an uncomfortable evening in town. It was absolutelyinnocent as regarded the doings of the night itself, but was terrible tohim. There was a slow drizzling rain; but not the less after dinner athis hotel he started off to wander through the streets. With hisgreat-coat and his umbrella he was almost hidden; and as he passedthrough Pall Mall, up St. James's Street, and along Piccadilly, he couldpause and look in at the accustomed door. He saw men entering whom heknew, and knew that within five minutes they could be seated at theirtables. "I had an awfully heavy time of it last night," one said toanother as he went up the steps; and Mountjoy, as he heard the words,envied the speaker. Then he passed back and went again a tour of all theclubs. What had he done that he, like a poor Peri, should be unable toenter the gates of all these paradises? He had now in his pocket fiftypounds. Could he have been made absolutely certain that he would havelost it, he would have gone into any paradise and have staked his moneywith that certainty.At last, having turned up Waterloo Place, he saw a man standing in thedoor-way of one of these palaces, and he was aware at once that the manhad seen him. He was a man of such a nature that it would be impossiblethat he should have seen a worse. He was a small, dry, good-lookinglittle fellow, with a carefully preserved mustache, and a head from thetop of which age was beginning to move the hair. He lived by cards, andlived well. He was called Captain Vignolles, but it was only known ofhim that he was a professional gambler. He probably never cheated. Menwho play at the clubs scarcely ever cheat,--there are so many with whomthey play sharp enough to discover them; and with the discovered gamblerall in this world is over. Captain Vignolles never cheated; but he foundthat an obedience to those little rules which I have named above stoodhim well in lieu of cheating. He was not known to have any particularincome, but he was known to live on the best of everything as far asclub life was concerned.He immediately followed Mountjoy down into the street and greeted him."Captain Scarborough as I am a living man!""Well, Vignolles; how are you?""And so you have come back once more to the land of the living! I wasawfully sorry for you, and think that they treated you uncommon harshly.As you've paid your money, of course they'll let you in again." Inanswer to this, Mountjoy had very little to say: but the interview endedby his accepting an invitation from Captain Vignolles to supper for thefollowing evening. If Captain Scarborough would come at eleven o'clockCaptain Vignolles would ask a few fellows to meet him, and they wouldhave--just a little rubber of whist. Mountjoy knew well the nature ofthe man who asked him, and understood perfectly what would be theresult; but there thrilled through his bosom, as he accepted theinvitation, a sense of joy which he could himself hardly understand.On the following morning Mountjoy was up, for him, very early, andtaking a return ticket went down to Buston. He had written to Mr.Prosper, sending his compliments, and saying that he would do himselfthe honor of calling at a certain hour.At the hour named he drew up at Buston Hall in a fly from BuntingfordStation, and was told by Matthew, the old butler, that his master was athome. If Captain Mountjoy would step into the drawing-room Mr. Prospershould be informed. Mountjoy did as he was bidden, and after half anhour he was joined by Mr. Prosper. "You have received a letter from myfather," he began by saying."A very long letter," said the Squire of Buston."I dare say; I did not see it, and have in fact very little to say as toits contents. I do not know, indeed, what they were.""The letter refers to my nephew, Mr. Henry Annesley.""I suppose so. What I have to say refers to Mr. Henry Annesley also.""You are kind,--very kind.""I don't know about that; but I have come altogether at my father'sinstance, and I think, indeed, that, in fairness, I ought to tell youthe truth as to what took place between me and your nephew.""You are very good; but your father has already given me hisaccount,--and I suppose yours.""I don't know what my father may have done, but I think that you oughtto desire to hear from my lips an account of the transaction. An untrueaccount has been told to you.""I have heard it all from your own brother.""An untrue account has been told to you. I attacked your nephew.""What made you do that?" asked the squire."That has nothing to do with it; but I did.""I understood all that before.""But you didn't understand that Mr. Annesley behaved perfectly well inall that occurred.""Did he tell a lie about it afterward?""My brother no doubt lured him on to make an untrue statement.""A lie!""You may call it so if you will. If you think that Augustus was to haveit all his own way, I disagree with you altogether. In point of fact,your nephew behaved through the whole of that matter as well as a mancould do. Practically, he told no lie at all. He did just what a manought to do, and anything that you have heard to the contrary iscalumnious and false. As I am told that you have been led by mybrother's statement to disinherit your nephew--""I have done nothing of the kind.""I am very glad to hear it. He has not, at any rate, deserved it; and Ihave felt it to be my duty to come and tell you."Then Mountjoy retired, not without hospitality having been coldlyoffered by Mr. Prosper, and went back to Buntingford and to London. Nowat last would come, he said to himself through the whole afternoon, nowat last would come a repetition of those joys for which his very soulhad sighed so eagerly.CHAPTER XLII.CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES ENTERTAINS HIS FRIENDS.Mountjoy, when he reached Captain Vignolles's rooms, was receivedapparently with great indifference. "I didn't feel at all sure youwould come. But there is a bit of supper, if you like to stay. I sawMoody this morning, and he said he would look in if he was passing thisway. Now sit down and tell me what you have been doing since youdisappeared in that remarkable manner." This was not at all whatMountjoy had expected, but he could only sit down and say that he haddone nothing in particular. Of all club men, Captain Vignolles would bethe worst with whom to play alone during the entire evening. AndMountjoy remembered now that he had never been inside four walls withVignolles except at a club. Vignolles regarded him simply as a piece ofprey whom chance had thrown up on the shore. And Moody, who would nodoubt show himself before long, was another bird of the same covey,though less rapacious. Mountjoy put his hand up to his breast-pocket,and knew that the fifty pounds was there, but he knew also that it wouldsoon be gone.Even to him it seemed to be expedient to get up and at once to go. Whatdelight would there be to him in playing piquet with such a faceopposite to him as that of Captain Vignolles, or with such a one as thatof old Moody? There could be none of the brilliance of the room, nopleasant hum of the voices of companions, no sense of his own equalitywith others. There would be none to sympathize with him when he cursedhis ill-luck, there would be no chance of contending with an innocentwho would be as reckless as was he himself. He looked round. The roomwas gloomy and uncomfortable. Captain Vignolles watched him, and wasafraid that his prey was about to escape. "Won't you light a cigar?"Mountjoy took the cigar, and then felt that he could not go quite atonce. "I suppose you went to Monaco?""I was there for a short time.""Monaco isn't bad,--though there is, of course, the pull which the tableshave against you. But it's a grand thing to think that skill can be ofno avail. I often think that I ought to play nothing but rouge et noir.""You?""Yes; I. I don't deny that I'm the luckiest fellow going; but I nevercan remember cards. Of course I know my trade. Every fellow knows histrade, and I'm up pretty nearly in all that the books tell you.""That's a great deal.""Not when you come to play with men who know what play is. Look atGrossengrannel. I'd sooner bet on him than any man in London.Grossengrannel never forgets a card. I'll bet a hundred pounds that heknows the best card in every suit throughout the entire day's play.That's his secret. He gives his mind to it,--which I can't. Hang it! I'malways thinking of something quite different,--of what I'm going to eat,or that sort of thing. Grossengrannel is always looking at the cards,and he wins the odd rubber out of every eleven by his attention. Shallwe have a game of piquet?"Now on the moment, in spite of all that he had felt during the entireday, in the teeth of all his longings, in opposition to all his thirst,Mountjoy for a minute or two did think that he could rise and go. Hisfather was about to put him on his legs again,--if only he would abstain.But Vignolles had the card-table open, with clean packs, and chairs atthe corners, before he could decide. "What is it to be? Twos on the gameI suppose." But Mountjoy would not play piquet. He named ecarte, andasked that it might be only ten shillings a game. It was many months nowsince he had played a game of ecarte. "Oh, hang it!" said Vignolles,still holding the pack in his hands. When thus appealed to Mountjoyrelented, and agreed that a pound should be staked on each game. Whenthey had played seven games Vignolles had won but one pound, andexpressed an opinion that that kind of thing wouldn't suit them at all."School-girls would do better," he said. Then Mountjoy pushed back hischair as though to go, when the door opened and Major Moody entered theroom. "Now we'll have a rubber at dummy," said Captain Vignolles.Major Moody was a gray-headed old man of about sixty, who played hiscards with great attention, and never spoke a word,--either then or atany other period of his life. He was the most taciturn of men, and wasknown not at all to any of his companions. It was rumored of him that hehad a wife at home, whom he kept in moderate comfort on his winnings. Itseemed to be the sole desire of his heart to play with reckless, foolishyoung men, who up to a certain point did not care what they lost. He waspopular, as being always ready to oblige every one, and, as wasfrequently said of him, was the very soul of honor. He certainly got noamusement from the play, working at it very hard,--and very constantly.No one ever saw him anywhere but at the club. At eight o'clock he wenthome to dinner, let us hope to the wife of his bosom, and at eleven hereturned, and remained as long as there were men to play with. A tediousand unsatisfactory life he had, and it would have been well for himcould his friends have procured on his behoof the comparative ease of astool in a counting-house. But, as no such Elysium was opened to him,the major went on accepting the smaller profits and the harder work ofclub life. In what regiment he had been a major no one knew or cared toinquire. He had been received as Major Moody for twenty years or more,and twenty years is surely time enough to settle a man's claim to amajority without reference to the Army List."How are you, Major Moody?" asked Mountjoy."Not much to boast of. I hope you're pretty well, Captain Scarborough."Beyond that there was no word of salutation, and no reference toMountjoy's wonderful absence."What's it to be:--twos and tens?" said Captain Vignolles, arranging thecards and the chairs."Not for me," said Mountjoy, who seemed to have been enveloped by a mostunusual prudence."What! are you afraid,--you who used to fear neither man nor devil?""There is so much in not being accustomed to it," said Mountjoy. "Ihaven't played a game of whist since I don't knew when.""Twos and tens is heavy against dummy," said Major Moody."I'll take dummy, if you like it," said Vignolles. Moody only looked athim."We'll each have our own dummy, of course," said Mountjoy."Just as you please," said Vignolles. "I'm host here, and of course willgive way to anything you may propose. What's it to be, Scarborough?""Pounds and fives. I shan't play higher than that." There came acrossMountjoy's mind, as he stated the stakes for which he consented to play,a remembrance that in the old days he had always been called CaptainScarborough by this man who now left out the captain. Of course he hadfallen since that,--fallen very low. He ought to feel obliged to any man,who had in the old days been a member of the same club with him, whowould now greet him with the familiarity of his unadorned name. But theremembrance of the old sounds came back upon his ear; and theconsciousness that, before his father's treatment of him, he had beenknown to the world at large as Captain Scarborough, of Tretton."Well, well; pounds and fives," said Vignolles. "It's better thanpottering away at ecarte at a pound a game. Of course a man could winsomething if the games were to run all one way; but where they alternateso quickly it amounts to nothing. You've got the first dummy,Scarborough. Where will you sit? Which cards will you take? I do believethat at whist everything depends upon the cards,--or else on the hinges.I've known eleven rubbers running to follow the hinges. People laugh atme because I believe in luck. I speak as I find it; that's all. You'veturned up an honor already. When a man begins with an honor he'll alwaysgo on with honors; that's my observation. I know you're pretty good atthis game, Moody, so I'll leave it to you to arrange the play, and willfollow up as well as I can. You lead up to the weak, of course." Thiswas not said till the card was out of his partner's hand. "But when youradversary has got ace, king, queen in his own hand there is no weak.Well, we've saved that, and it's as much as we can expect. If I'd begunby leading a trump it would have been all over with us. Won't you lighta cigar, Moody?""I never smoke at cards.""That's all very well for the club, but you might relax a little here.Scarborough will take another cigar." But even Mountjoy was too prudent.He did not take the cigar, but he did win the rubber. "You're in for agood thing to-night, I feel as certain of it as though the money were inyour pocket."Mountjoy, though he would not smoke, did drink. What would they have,asked Vignolles. There was champagne, and whiskey, and brandy. He wasafraid there was no other wine. He opened a bottle of champagne, andMountjoy took the tumbler that was filled for him. He always drankwhiskey-and-water himself,--so he said, and filled for himself a glass inwhich he poured a very small allowance of alcohol. Major Moody asked forbarley-water. As there was none, he contented himself with sippingApollinaris.A close record of the events of that evening would make but a tedioustale for readers. Mountjoy of course lost his fifty pounds. Alas! helost much more than his fifty pounds. The old spirit soon came upon him,and the remembrance of what his father was to do for him passed awayfrom him, and all thoughts of his adversaries,--who and what they were.The major pertinaciously refused to increase his stakes, and, worseagain, refused to play for anything but ready money. "It's a kind ofthing I never do. You may think me very odd, but it's a kind of thing Inever do." It was the longest speech he made through the entire evening.Vignolles reminded him that he did in fact play on credit at the club."The committee look to that," he murmured, and shook his head. ThenVignolles offered again to take the dummy, so that there should be nonecessity for Moody and Scarborough to play against each other, andoffered to give one point every other rubber as the price to be paid forthe advantage. But Moody, whose success for the night was assured by thethirty pounds which he had in his pocket, would come to no terms. "Youmean to say you're going to break us up," said Vignolles. "That'll behard on Scarborough.""I'll go on for money," said the immovable major."I suppose you won't have it out with me at double dummy?" saidVignolles to his victim. "But double dummy is a terrible grind at thistime of night." And he pushed all the cards up together, so as to showthat the amusement for the night was over. He too saw the difficultywhich Moody so pertinaciously avoided. He had been told wondrous thingsof the old squire's intentions toward his eldest son, but he had beentold them only by that eldest son himself. No doubt he could go onwinning. Unless in the teeth of a most obstinate run of cards, he wouldbe sure to win against Scarborough's apparent forgetfulness of allrules, and ignorance of the peculiarities of the game he was playing.But he would more probably obtain payment of the two hundred and thirtypounds now due to him,--that or nearly that,--than of a larger sum. Healready had in his possession the other twenty pounds which poorMountjoy had brought with him. So he let the victim go. Moody wentfirst, and Vignolles then demanded the performance of a small ceremony."Just put your name to that," said Vignolles. It was a written promiseto pay to Captain Vignolles the exact sum of two hundred andtwenty-seven pounds on or before that day week. "You'll be punctual,won't you?""Of course I'll be punctual," said Mountjoy, scowling."Well, yes; no doubt. But there have been mistakes.""I tell you you'll be paid. Why the devil did you win it of me if youdoubt it?""I saw you just roaming about, and I meant to be good-natured.""You know as well as any man what chances you should run, and when tohold your hand. If you tell me about mistakes, I shall make itpersonal.""I didn't say anything, Scarborough, that ought to be taken up in thatway.""Hang your Scarborough! When one gentleman talks another about mistakeshe means something." Then he smashed down his hat upon his head and leftthe room.Vignolles emptied the bottle of champagne, in which one glass was left,and sat himself down with the document in his hand. "Just the samefellow," he said to himself; "overbearing, reckless, pig-headed, and abully. He'd lose the Bank of England if he had it. But then he don'tpay! He hasn't a scruple about that. If I lose I have to pay. By Jove,yes! Never didn't pay a shilling I lost in my life! It's deuced hard,when a fellow is on the square like that, to make two ends meet when hecomes across defaulters. Those fellows should be hung. They're the veryscum of the earth. Talk of welchers! They're worse than any welcher.Welcher is a thing you needn't have to do with if you're careful. Butwhen a fellow turns round upon you as a defaulter at cards, there is nogetting rid of him. Where the play is all straightforward and honorable,a defaulter when he shows himself ought to be well-nigh murdered."Such were Captain Vignolles's plaints to himself, as he sat therelooking at the suspicious document which Mountjoy had left in his hands.To him it was a fact that he had been cruelly used in having such a bitof paper thrust upon him instead of being paid by a check which on themorning would be honored. And as he thought of his own career; hisready-money payments; his obedience to certain rules of the game,--rules,I mean, against cheating; as he thought of his hands, which in his ownestimation were beautifully clean; his diligence in his profession,which to him was honorable; his hard work; his late hours; his devotionto a task which was often tedious; his many periods of heart-rendingloss, which when they occurred would drive him nearly mad; his smallcustomary gains; his inability to put by anything for old age; of thenarrow edge by which he himself was occasionally divided fromdefalcation, he spoke to himself of himself as of an honest,hard-working professional man upon whom the world was peculiarly hard.But Major Moody went home to his wife quite content with the thirtypounds which he had won.CHAPTER XLIII.MR. PROSPER IS VISITED BY HIS LAWYERS.Mr. Prosper had not been in good spirits at the time at which MountjoyScarborough had visited him. He had received some time previously aletter from Mr. Grey, as described in a previous chapter, and had alsoknown exactly what proposal had been made by Mr. Grey to Messrs. Soames& Simpson. An equal division of the lady's income, one half to go to thelady herself, and the other half to Mr. Prosper, with an annuity of twohundred and fifty pounds out of the estate for the lady if Mr. Prospershould die first: these were the terms which had been offered to MissThoroughbung with the object of inducing her to become the wife of Mr.Prosper. But to these terms Miss Thoroughbung had declined to accede,and had gone about the arrangement of her money-matters in a mostprecise and business-like manner. A third of her income she would giveup, since Mr. Prosper desired it; but more than that she "would owe itto herself and her friends to decline to abandon." The payment for thefish and the champagne must be omitted from any agreement on her part.As to the ponies, and their harness, and the pony-carriage, she wouldsupply them. The ponies and the carriage would be indispensable to herhappiness. But the maintenance of the ponies must be left to Mr.Prosper. As for the dower, she could not consent to accept less thanfour hundred--or five hundred, if no house was to be provided. Shethought that seven hundred and fifty would be little enough if therewere no children, as in that case there was no heir for whom Mr. Prosperwas especially anxious. But as there probably would be children, MissThoroughbung thought that this was a matter to which Mr. Prosper wouldnot give much consideration. Throughout it all she maintained abeautiful equanimity, and made two or three efforts to induce Mr.Prosper to repeat his visit to Marmaduke Lodge. She herself wrote to himsaying that she thought it odd that, considering their near alliance, heshould not come and see her. Once she said that she had heard that hewas ill, and offered to go to Buston Hall to visit him.All this was extremely distressing to a gentleman of Mr. Prosper'sdelicate feelings. As to the proposals in regard to money, the lettersfrom Soames & Simpson to Grey & Barry, all of which came down to BustonHall, seemed to be innumerable.With Soames & Simpson Mr. Prosper declined to have any personalcommunication. But every letter from the Buntingford attorneys wasaccompanied by a farther letter from the London attorneys, till thecorrespondence became insupportable. Mr. Prosper was not strong enoughto stick firmly to his guns as planted for him by Messrs. Grey & Barry.He did give way in some matters, and hence arose renewed letters whichnearly drove him mad. Messrs. Soames & Simpson's client was willing toaccept four hundred pounds as the amount of the dower without referenceto the house, and to this Mr. Prosper yielded. He did not much careabout any heir as yet unborn, and felt by no means so certain in regardto children as did the lady. But he fought hard about the ponies. Hecould not undertake that his wife should have ponies. That must be leftto him as master of the house. He thought that a pair of carriage-horsesfor her use would be sufficient. He had always kept a carriage, andintended to do so. She might bring her ponies if she pleased, but if hethought well to part with them he would sell them. He found himselfgetting deeper and deeper into the quagmire, till he began to doubtwhether he should be able to extricate himself unmarried if he wereanxious to do so. And all the while there came affectionate little notesfrom Miss Thoroughbung asking after his health, and recommending himwhat to take, till he entertained serious thoughts of going to Cairo forthe winter.Then Mr. Barry came down to see him after Mountjoy had made his visit.It was now January, and the bargaining about the marriage had gone onfor more than two months. The letter which he had received from theSquire of Tretton had moved him; but he had told himself that theproperty was his own, and that he had a right to enjoy it as he likedbest.Whatever might have been Harry's faults in regard to that midnightaffair, it had certainly been true that he had declined to hear thesermons. Mr. Prosper did not exactly mention the sermons to himself, butthere was present to him a feeling that his heir had been wilfullydisobedient, and the sermons no doubt had been the cause. When he hadread the old squire's letter he did not as yet wish to forgive hisnephew. He was becoming very tired of his courtship, but in hisestimation the wife would be better than the nephew. Though he had beenmuch put out by the precocity of that embrace, there was nevertheless asweetness about it which lingered on his lips. Then Mountjoy had comedown, and he had answered Mountjoy very stoutly: "A lie!" he hadexclaimed. "Did he tell a lie?" he had asked, as though all must be overwith a young man who had once allowed himself to depart from the rigidtruth. Mountjoy had made what excuse he could, but Mr. Prosper had beenvery stern.On the very day after Mountjoy's coming Mr. Barry came. His visit hadbeen arranged, and Mr. Prosper was, with great care, prepared toencounter him. He was wrapped in his best dressing-gown, and Matthew hadshaved him with the greatest care. The girls over at the parsonagedeclared that their uncle had sent into Buntingford for a special pot ofpomatum. The story was told to Joe Thoroughbung in order that it mightbe passed on to his aunt, and no doubt it did travel as it was intended.But Miss Thoroughbung cared nothing for the pomatum with which thelawyer from London was to be received. It would be very hard to laughher out of her lover while the title-deeds to Buston held good. But Mr.Prosper had felt that it would be necessary to look his best, so thathis marriage might be justified in the eyes of the lawyer.Mr. Barry was shown into the book-room at Buston, in which Mr. Prosperwas seated ready to receive him. The two gentlemen had never before meteach other, and Mr. Prosper did no doubt assume something of the mannerof an aristocratic owner of land. He would not have done so had Mr. Greycome in his partner's place. But there was a humility about Mr. Barry onan occasion such as the present, which justified a little pride on thepart of the client. "I am sorry to give you the trouble to come down,Mr. Barry," he said. "I hope the servant has shown you your room.""I shall be back in London to-day, Mr. Prosper, thank you. I must seethese lawyers here, and when I have received your final instructions Iwill return to Buntingford." Then Mr. Prosper pressed him much to stay.He had quite expected, he said, that Mr. Barry would have done him thepleasure of remaining at any rate one night at Buston. But Mr. Barrysettled the question by saying that he had not brought a dress-coat. Mr.Prosper did not care to sit down to dinner with guests who did not bringtheir dress-coats. "And now," continued Mr. Barry, "what finalinstructions are we to give to Soames & Simpson?""I don't think much of Messrs. Soames & Simpson.""I believe they have the name of being honest practitioners.""I dare say; I do not in the least doubt it. But they are people to whomI am not at all desirous of intrusting my own private affairs. Messrs.Soames & Simpson have not, I think, a large county business. I had noidea that Miss Thoroughbung would have put this affair into theirhands.""Just so, Mr. Prosper. But I suppose it was necessary for her to employsomebody. There has been a good deal of correspondence.""Indeed there has, Mr. Barry.""It has not been our fault, Mr. Prosper. Now what we have got to decideis this: What are the final terms which you mean to propose? I think,sir, the time has come when some final terms should be suggested.""Just so. Final terms--must be what you call--the very last. That is,when they have once been offered, you must--must--""Just stick to them, Mr. Prosper.""Exactly, Mr. Barry. That is what I intend. There is nothing I dislikeso much as this haggling about money, especially with a lady. MissThoroughbung is a lady for whom I have the highest possible esteem.""That's of course.""For whom, I repeat, I have the highest possible esteem. But she hasfriends who have their own ideas as to money. The brewery in Buntingfordbelongs to them, and they are very worthy people. I should explain toyou, Mr. Barry, as you are my confidential adviser, that were I about toform a matrimonial alliance in the heyday of my youth, I should probablynot have thought of connecting myself with the Thoroughbungs. As I havesaid before, they are most respectable people; but they do not exactlybelong to that class in which I should, under those circumstances, havelooked for a wife. I might probably have ventured to ask for the hand ofthe daughter of some county family. But years have slipped by me, andnow wishing in middle life to procure for myself the comfort of weddedhappiness, I have looked about, and have found no one more likely togive it me, than Miss Thoroughbung. Her temper is excellent, and herperson pleasing." Mr. Prosper, as he said this, thought of the kisswhich had been bestowed upon him. "Her wit is vivacious, and I thinkthat upon the whole she will be desirable as a companion. She will notcome to this house empty-handed; but of her pecuniary affairs youalready know so much that I need, perhaps, tell you nothing farther.But though I am exceedingly desirous to make this lady my wife, and am,I may say, warmly attached to her, there are certain points which Icannot sacrifice. Now about the ponies--""I think I understand about the ponies. She may bring them on trial.""I'm not to be bound to keep any ponies at all. There are a pair ofcarriage-horses which must suffice. On second thoughts, she had betternot bring the ponies." This decision had at last come from some littledoubt on his mind as to whether he was treating Harry justly."And four hundred pounds is the sum fixed on for her jointure.""She is to have her own money for her own life," said Mr. Prosper."That's a matter of course.""Don't you think that, under these circumstances, four hundred will bequite enough?""Quite enough, if you ask me. But we must decide.""Four hundred it shall be.""And she is to have two-thirds of her own money for her own expensesduring your life?" asked Mr. Barry."I don't see why she should want six hundred a year for herself; I don'tindeed. I am afraid it will only lead to extravagance!" Barry assumed alook of despair. "Of course, as I have said so, I will not go back frommy word. She shall have two-thirds. But about the ponies my mind isquite made up. There shall be no ponies at Buston. I hope you understandthat, Mr. Barry?" Mr. Barry said that he did understand it well, andthen, folding up his papers, prepared to go, congratulating himself thathe would not have to pass a long evening at Buston Hall.But before he went, and when he had already put on his great-coat in thehall, Mr. Prosper called him back to ask him one farther question; andfor that purpose he shut the door carefully, and uttered his words in awhisper. Did Mr. Barry know anything of the life and recent adventuresof Mr. Henry Annesley? Mr. Barry knew nothing; but he thought that hispartner, Mr. Grey, knew something. He had heard Mr. Grey mention thename of Mr. Henry Annesley. Then as he stood there, enveloped in hisgreat-coat, with his horse standing in the cold, Mr. Prosper told himmuch of the story of Harry Annesley, and asked him to induce Mr. Grey towrite and tell him what he thought of Harry's conduct.CHAPTER XLIV.MR. PROSPER'S TROUBLES.As Mr. Prosper sunk into his arm-chair after the fatigue of theinterview with his lawyer, he reflected that, when all was considered,Harry Annesley was an ungrateful pig,--it was thus he called him,--andthat Miss Thoroughbung had many attractions. Miss Thoroughbung hadprobably done well to kiss him, though the enterprise had not beenwithout its peculiar dangers. He often thought of it when alone, and, as"distance lent enchantment to the view," he longed to have theexperiment repeated. Perhaps she had been right. And it would be a goodthing, certainly, to have dear little children of his own. MissThoroughbung felt very certain on the subject, and it would be foolishfor him to doubt. Then he thought of the difference between a prettyfair haired little boy and that ungrateful pig, Harry Annesley. He toldhimself that he was very fond of children. The girls over at theparsonage would not have said so, but they probably did not know hischaracter.When Harry had come back with his fellowship, his uncle had for a fewweeks been very proud of him,--had declared that he should never becalled upon to earn his bread, and had allowed him two hundred and fiftypounds a year to begin with: but no return had been made to this favor.Harry had walked in and out of the Hall as though it had alreadybelonged to him,--as many a father delights to see his eldest son doing.But the uncle in this instance had not taken any delight in seeing it.An uncle is different from a father,--an uncle who has never had a childof his own. He wanted deference,--what he would have called respect;while Harry was at first prepared to give him a familiar affection basedon equality,--on an equality in money matters and worldlyinterests,--though I fear that Harry allowed to be seen his ownintellectual superiority. Mr. Prosper, though an ignorant man, and by nomeans clever, was not such a fool as not to see all this. Then had comethe persistent refusal to hear the sermons, and Mr. Prosper hadsorrowfully declared to himself that his heir was not the young man thathe should have been.He did not then think of marrying, nor did he stop the allowance; but hedid feel that his heir was not what he should have been. But then theterrible disgrace of that night in London had occurred, and his eyeshad been altogether opened by that excellent young man, Mr. AugustusScarborough; then he began to look about him. Then dim ideas of thecharms and immediate wealth of Miss Thoroughbung flitted before hiseyes, and he told himself again and again of the prospects and undoubtedgood birth of Miss Puffle. Miss Puffle had disgraced herself, andtherefore he had thrown Buston Hall at the feet of Miss Thoroughbung.But now he had heard stories about that "excellent young man, AugustusScarborough," which had shaken his faith. He had been able to exclaimindignantly that Harry Annesley had told a lie. "A lie!" He had beensurprised to find that a young man who had lived so much in thefashionable world as Captain Scarborough had cared nothing for this. Andas Miss Thoroughbung became more and more exacting in regard to money,he thought, himself, less and less of the lie. It might be well thatHarry should ultimately have the property, though he should never againbe taken into favor, and there should be no farther question of theallowance. As Miss Thoroughbung reiterated her demands for the ponies,he began to feel that the acres of Buston would not be disgraced foreverby the telling of that lie. But the sermons remained, and he would neverwillingly again see his nephew. As he turned all this in his mind, theidea of spending what was left of the winter at Cairo returned to him.He would go to Cairo for the winter, and to the Italian lakes for thespring, and to Switzerland for the summer. Then he might return toCairo. At the present moment Buston Hall and the neighborhood ofBuntingford had few charms for him. He was afraid that Miss Thoroughbungwould not give way about the ponies; and against the ponies he wasresolved.He was sitting in this state with a map before him, and with thesquire's letter upon the map, when Matthew, the butler, opened the doorand announced a visitor. As soon as Mr. Barry had gone, he had supportednature by a mutton-chop and a glass of sherry, and the debris were nowlying on the side-table. His first idea was to bid Matthew at onceremove the glass and the bone, and the unfinished potato and the crustof bread. To be taken with such remnants by any visitor would be bad,but by this visitor would be dreadful. Lunch should be eaten in thedining-room, where chop bones and dirty glasses would be in their place.But here in his book-room they would be disgraceful. But then, asMatthew was hurriedly collecting the two plates and the salt-cellar, hismaster began to doubt whether this visitor should be received at all.It was no other than Miss Thoroughbung.Mr. Prosper, in order to excuse his slackness in calling on the lady,had let it be known that he was not quite well, and Miss Thoroughbunghad responded to this move by offering her services as nurse to herlover. He had then written to herself that, though he had been a littleunwell, "suffering from a cold in the chest, to which at this inclementseason of the year it was peculiarly liable," he was not in need ofanything beyond a little personal attention, and would not trouble herfor those services, for the offer of which he was bound to be peculiarlygrateful. Thus he had thought to keep Miss Thoroughbung at a distance;but here she was with those hated ponies at his very door. "Matthew," hesaid, making a confidant, in the distress of the moment of his butler,"I don't think I can see her.""You must, sir; indeed you must.""Must!""Well, yes; I'm afraid so. Considering all things,--the matrimonialprospects and the rest of it,--I think you must, sir.""She hasn't a right to come here, you know,--as yet." It will beunderstood that Mr. Prosper was considerably discomposed when he spokewith such familiar confidence to his servant. "She needn't come in here,at any rate.""In the drawing-room, if I might be allowed to suggest, sir.""Show Miss Thoroughbung into the drawing-room," said he with all hisdignity. Then Matthew retired, and the Squire of Buston felt that fiveminutes might be allowed to collect himself, and the mutton-chop boneneed not be removed.When the five minutes were over, with slow steps he walked across theintervening billiard-room, and slowly opened the drawing-room door.Would she rush into his arms, and kiss him again as he entered? Hesincerely hoped that there would be no such attempt; but if there were,he was sternly resolved to repudiate it. There should be nothing of thekind till she had clearly declared, and had put it under writing byherself and her lawyers, that she would consent to come to Bustonwithout the ponies. But there was no such attempt. "How do you do, Mr.Prosper?" she said, in a loud voice, standing up in the middle of theroom. "Why don't you ever come and see me? I take it very ill of you;and so does Miss Tickle. There is no one more partial to you than MissTickle. We were talking of you only last night over a despatched crabthat we had for supper." Did they have despatched crabs for supper everynight? thought Mr. Prosper to himself. It was certainly a strong reasonagainst his marriage. "I told her that you had a cold in your head.""In my chest," said Mr. Prosper, meekly."'Bother colds!' said Miss Tickle. 'When people are keeping companytogether they ought to see each other.' Those were Miss Tickle's verywords."That it should be said of him, Mr. Prosper, of Buston, that he was"keeping company" with any woman! He almost resolved, on the spur of themoment, that under no circumstances could he now marry MissThoroughbung. But unfortunately his offer had been made, and the termsof the settlement, as suggested by himself, placed in the hands of hislawyer. If Miss Thoroughbung chose to hold him to his offer, he mustmarry her. It was not that he feared an action for breach of promise,but that, as a gentleman, it would behoove him to be true to his word.He need not, however, marry Miss Tickle. He had offered no terms inrespect to Miss Tickle. With great presence of mind he resolved at oncethat Miss Tickle should never find a permanent resting-place for herfoot at Buston Hall. "I am extremely indebted to Miss Tickle," said he."Why haven't you come over just to have a little chat in a friendly way?It's all because of those stupid lawyers, I suppose. What need you and Icare for the lawyers? They can do their work without troubling us,except that they will be sure to send in their bills fast enough.""I have had Mr. Barry, from the firm of Messrs. Grey & Barry, ofLincoln's Inn, with me this morning.""I know you have. I saw the little man at Soames & Simpson's, and droveout here immediately, after five minutes' conversation. Now, Mr.Prosper, you must let me have those ponies."That was the very thing which he was determined not to do. The poniesgrew in imagination, and became enormous horses capable of consuming anyamount of oats. Mr. Prosper was not of a stingy nature, but he hadalready perceived that his escape, if it were effected, must be madegood by means of those ponies. A steady old pair of carriage-horses hadbeen kept by him, and by his father before him, and he was not going tobe driven out of the old family ways by a brewer's daughter. And he had,but that morning, instructed his lawyer to stand out against the ponies.He felt that this was the moment for firmness. Now, this instant, hemust be staunch, or he would be saddled with this woman,--and with MissTickle,--for the whole of his life. She had left him no time forconsideration, but had come upon him as soon almost as the words spokento the lawyer had been out of his mouth. But he would be firm. MissThoroughbung opened out instantly about the ponies, and he at onceresolved that he would be firm. But was it not very indelicate on herpart to come to him and to press him in this manner? He began to hopethat she also would be firm about the ponies, and that in this way theseparation might be effected. At the present moment he stood dumb.Silence would not in this case be considered as giving consent. "Now,like a good man, do say that I shall have the ponies," she continued. "Ican keep 'em out of my own money, you know, if that's all." He perceivedat once that the offer amounted to a certain yielding on her part, buthe was no longer anxious that she should give way. "Do'ee now say yes,like a dear old boy." She came closer to him, and took hold of his arm,as though she were going to perform that other ceremony. But he wasfully aware of the danger. If there came to be kissing between them itwould be impossible for him to go back afterward in such a manner butthat the blame of the kiss should rest with him. When he should desireto be "off," he could not plead that the kissing had been all her doing.A man in Mr. Prosper's position has difficulties among which he must bevery wary. And then the ridicule of the world is so strong a weapon, andis always used on the side of the women! He gave a little start, but hedid not at once shake her off. "What's the objection to the ponies,dear?""Two pair of horses! It's more than we ought to keep." He should nothave said "we." He felt, when it was too late, that he should not havesaid "we.""They aren't horses.""It's the same, as far as the stables are concerned.""But there's room enough, Lord bless you! I've been in to look. I canassure you that Dr. Stubbs says they are required for my health. You askhim else. It's just what I'm up to--is driving. I've only taken to themlately, and I cannot bring myself to give 'em up. Do'ee love. You're notgoing to throw over your own Matilda for a couple of little beasts likethat!"Every word that came out of her mouth was an offence. But he could nottell her so; nor could he reject her on that score. He should havethought beforehand what kind of words might probably come out of hermouth. Was her name Matilda? Of course he knew the fact. Had any oneasked him he could have said, with two minutes' consideration, that hername was Matilda. But it had never become familiar to his ears, and nowshe spoke of it as though he had called her Matilda since their earliestyouth. And to be called "Love!" It might be very nice when he had firstcalled her "Love" a dozen times; but now it sounded extravagant--andalmost indelicate. And he was about to throw her over for a couple oflittle beasts. He felt that that was his intention, and he blushedbecause it was so. He was a true gentleman, who would not willinglydepart from his word. If he must go on with the ponies he must. But hehad never yet yielded about the ponies. He felt now that they were hisonly hope. But as the difficulties of his position pressed upon him thesweat stood out upon his brow. She saw it all and understood it all, anddeliberately determined to take advantage of his weakness. "I don'tthink that there is anything else astray between us. We've settled aboutthe jointure,--four hundred a year. It's too little, Soames & Simpsonsay; but I'm soft, and in love, you know." Here she leered at him, andhe began to hate her. "You oughtn't to want a third of my income, youknow. But you're to be lord and master, and you must have your own way.All that's settled.""There is Miss Tickle," he said, in a voice that was almost cadaverous."Miss Tickle is of course to come. You said that from the very firstmoment when you made the offer.""Never!""Oh, Peter, how can you say so!" He shrunk visibly from the sound of hisown Christian name. But she determined to persevere. The time must comewhen she should call him Peter, and why not commence the practice now,at once? Lovers always do call each other Peter and Matilda. She wasn'tgoing to stand any nonsense, and if he intended to marry her and use alarge proportion of her fortune, Peter he should be to her. "You did,Peter. You know you told me how much attached you were to her.""I didn't say anything about her coming with you.""Oh, Peter, how can you be so cruel? Do you mean to say that you willdeprive me of the friend of my youth?""At any rate, there shall never be a pony come into my yard!" He knewwhen he made this assertion that he was abandoning his objection to MissTickle. She had called him cruel, and his conscience told him that if hereceived Miss Thoroughbung and refused admission to Miss Tickle hewould be cruel. Miss Tickle, for aught that he knew, might have been afriend of her youth. At any rate, they had been constant companions formany years. Therefore, as he had another solid ground on which to stand,he could afford to yield as to Miss Tickle. But as he did so, heremembered that Miss Tickle had accused him of "keeping company," and hedeclared to himself that it would be impossible to live in the samehouse with her."But Miss Tickle may come?" said Miss Thoroughbung. Was the solidground--the rock, as he believed it to be, of the ponies, about to sinkbeneath his feet? "Say that Miss Tickle may come. I should be nothingwithout Miss Tickle. You cannot be so hard-hearted as that.""I don't see what is the good of talking about Miss Tickle till we havecome to some settlement about the ponies. You say that you must have theponies. To tell you the truth, Miss Thoroughbung, I don't like any suchword as 'must.' And a good many things have occurred to me.""What kind of things, deary?""I think you are inclined to be--gay--""Me! gay!""While I am sober, and perhaps a little grave in my manners of life. Iam thinking only of domestic happiness, while your mind is intent uponsocial circles. I fear that you would look for your bliss abroad.""In France or Germany?""When I say abroad, I mean out of your own house. There is perhaps somediscrepancy of taste of which I ought earlier to have taken cognizance.""Nothing of the kind," said Miss Thoroughbung. "I am quite content tolive at home and do not want to go abroad, either to France nor yet toany other English county. I should never ask for anything, unless it befor a single month in London."Here was a ground upon which he perhaps could make his stand. "Quiteimpossible!" said Mr. Prosper."Or for a fortnight," said Miss Thoroughbung."I never go up to London except on business.""But I might go alone, you know--with Miss Tickle. I shouldn't want todrag you away. I have always been in the habit of having a few weeks inLondon about the Exhibition time.""I shouldn't wish to be left by my wife.""Of course we could manage all that. We're not to settle every littlething beforehand, and put it into the deeds. A precious sum we shouldhave to pay the lawyers!""It's as well we should understand each other.""I think it pretty nearly is all settled that has to go into the deeds.I thought I'd just run over, after seeing Mr. Barry, and give the finaltouch. If you'll give way, dear, about Miss Tickle and the ponies, I'llyield in everything else. Nothing, surely, can be fairer than that."He knew that he was playing the hypocrite, and he knew also that it didnot become him as a gentleman to be false to a woman. He was aware thatfrom minute to minute, and almost from word to word, he was becomingever more and more averse to this match which he had proposed tohimself. And he knew that in honesty he ought to tell her that it wasso. It was not honest in him to endeavor to get rid of her by aside-blow, as it were. And yet this was the attempt which he hadhitherto been making. But how was he to tell her the truth? Even Mr.Barry had not understood the state of his mind. Indeed, his mind hadaltered since he had seen Mr. Barry.He had heard within the last half hour many words spoken by MissThoroughbung which proved that she was altogether unfit to be his wife.It was a dreadful misfortune that he should have rushed into such peril;but was he not bound as a gentleman to tell her the truth? "Say that Ishall have Jemima Tickle!" The added horrors of the Christian nameoperated upon him with additional force. Was he to be doomed to have theword Jemima hallooed about his rooms and staircases for the rest of hislife? And she had given up the ponies, and was taking her stand uponMiss Tickle, as to whom at last he would be bound to give way. He couldsee now that he should have demanded her whole income, and have allowedher little or no jointure. That would have been grasping, monstrous,altogether impracticable, but it would not have been ungentleman-like.This chaffering about little things was altogether at variance with histastes,--and it would be futile. He must summon courage to tell her thathe no longer wished for the match; but he could not do it on thismorning. Then,--for that morning,--some benign god preserved him.Matthew came into the room and whispered into his ear that a gentlemanwished to see him. "What gentleman?" Matthew again whispered that it washis brother-in-law. "Show him in," said Mr. Prosper, with a suddencourage. He had not seen Mr. Annesley since the day of his actualquarrel with Harry. "I shall have the ponies?" said Miss Thoroughbungduring the moment that was allowed to her."We are interrupted now. I am afraid that the rest of this interviewmust be postponed." It should never be renewed, though he might have toleave the country forever. Of that he gave himself assurance. Then theparson was shown into the room.The constrained introduction was very painful to Mr. Prosper, but wasnot at all disagreeable to the lady. "Mr. Annesley knows me very well.We are quite old friends. Joe is going to marry his eldest girl. I hopeMolly is quite well." The rector said that Molly was quite well. When hehad come away from home just now he had left Joe at the parsonage."You'll find him there a deal oftener than at the brewery," said MissThoroughbung. "You know what we're going to do, Mr. Annesley. There areno fools like old fools." A thunder-black cloud came across Mr.Prosper's face. That this woman should dare to call him an old fool! "Wewere discussing a few of our future arrangements. We've arrangedeverything about money in the most amicable manner, and now there ismerely a question of a pair of ponies.""We need not trouble Mr. Annesley about that, I think.""And Miss Tickle! I'm sure the rector will agree with me that oldfriends like me and Miss Tickle ought not to be separated. And it isn'tas though there was any dislike between them, because he has alreadysaid that he finds Miss Tickle charming.""D---- Miss Tickle!" he said; whereupon the rector looked astonished, andMiss Thoroughbung jumped a foot from off the ground. "I beg the lady'spardon," said Mr. Prosper, piteously, "and yours, Miss Thoroughbung,--andyours, Mr. Annesley." It was as though a new revelation of character hadbeen given. No one except Matthew had ever heard the Squire of Bustonswear. And with Matthew the cursings had been by no means frequent, andhad been addressed generally to some article of his clothing, or to somemorsel of food prepared with less than the usual care. But now the oathhad been directed against a female, and the chosen friend of hisbetrothed. And it had been uttered in the presence of a clergyman, hisbrother-in-law, and the rector of his parish. Mr. Prosper felt that hewas disgraced forever. Could he have overheard them laughing over hisebullition in the drawing-room half an hour afterward, and almostpraising his violence, some part of the pain might have been removed.As it was he felt at the time that he was disgraced forever."We will return to the subject when next we meet," said MissThoroughbung."I am very sorry that I should so far have forgotten myself," said Mr.Prosper, "but--""It does not signify,--not as far as I am concerned;" and she made alittle motion to the clergyman, half bow and half courtesy. Mr. Annesleybowed in return, as though declaring that neither did it signify verymuch as far as he was concerned. Then she left the room, and Matthewhanded her into the carriage, when she took the ponies in hand withquite as much composure as though her friend had not been sworn at."Upon my word, sir," said Prosper, as soon as the door was shut, "I begyour pardon. But I was so moved by certain things which have occurredthat I was carried much beyond my usual habits.""Don't mention it.""It is peculiarly distressing to me that I should have been induced toforget myself in the presence of a clergyman of the parish and mybrother-in-law. But I must beg you to forget it.""Oh, certainly. I will tell you now why I have come over.""I can assure you that such is not my habit," continued Mr. Prosper, whowas thinking much more of the unaccustomed oath which he had sworn thanof his brother-in-law's visit, strange as it was. "No one, as a rule, ismore guarded in his expressions than I am. How it should have come topass that I was so stirred I can hardly tell. But Miss Thoroughbung hadsaid certain words which had moved me very much." She had called him"Peter" and "deary," and had spoken of him as "keeping company" withher. All these disgusting terms of endearment he could not repeat to hisbrother-in-law, but felt it necessary to allude to them."I trust that you may be happy with her when she is your wife.""I can't say. I really don't know. It's a very important step to take atmy age, and I'm not quite sure that I should be doing wisely.""It's not too late," said Mr. Annesley."I don't know. I can't quite say." Then Mr. Prosper drew himself up,remembering that it would not become him to discuss the matter of hismarriage with the father of his heir."I have come over here," said Mr. Annesley, "to say a few words aboutHarry." Mr. Prosper again drew himself up. "Of course you're aware thatHarry is at present living with us." Here Mr. Prosper bowed. "Of course,in his altered circumstances, it will not do that he shall be idle, andyet he does not like to take a final step without letting you know whatit is." Here Mr. Prosper bowed twice. "There is a gentleman of fortunegoing out to the United States on a mission which will probably occupyhim for three or four years. I am not exactly warranted in mentioninghis name, but he has taken in hand a political project of muchimportance." Again Mr. Prosper bowed. "Now he has offered Harry theplace of private secretary, on condition that Harry will undertake tostay the entire term. He is to have a salary of three hundred a year,and his travelling expenses will of course be paid for him. If he goes,poor boy! he will in all probability remain in his new home and become acitizen of the United States. Under these circumstances I have thoughtit best to step up and tell you in a friendly manner what his plansare." Then he had told his tale, and Mr. Prosper again bowed.The rector had been very crafty. There was no doubt about the wealthygentleman with the American project, and the salary had been offered.But in other respects there had been some exaggeration. It was wellknown to the rector that Mr. Prosper regarded America and all herinstitutions with a religious hatred. An American was to him anignorant, impudent, foul-mouthed, fraudulent creature, to have anyacquaintance with whom was a disgrace. Could he have had his way, hewould have reconstituted the United States as British Colonies at amoment's notice. Were he to die without having begotten another heir,Buston must become the property of Harry Annesley; and it would bedreadful to him to think that Buston should be owned by an Americancitizen. "The salary offered is too good to be abandoned," said Mr.Annesley, when he saw the effect which his story had produced."Everything is going against me!" exclaimed Mr. Prosper."Well: I will not talk about that. I did not come here to discuss Harryor his sins,--nor, for the matter of that, his virtues. But I felt itwould be improper to let him go upon his journey without communicatingwith you." So saying, he took his departure and walked back to therectory.CHAPTER XLV.A DETERMINED YOUNG LADY.When this offer had been made to Harry Annesley he found it to beabsolutely necessary that he should write a farther letter to Florence.He was quite aware that he had been forbidden to write. He had writtenone letter since that order had been given to him, and no reply had cometo him. He had not expected a reply; but still her silence had beengrievous to him. It might be that she was angry with him, really angry.But let that be as it might, he could not go to America, and be absentfor so long a period, without telling her. She and her mother were stillat Brussels when January came. Mrs. Mountjoy had gone there, as he hadunderstood, for a month, and was still at the embassy when three monthshad passed. "I think I shall stay here the winter," Mrs. Mountjoy hadsaid to Sir Magnus, "but we will take lodgings. I see that very nicesets of apartments are to be let." But Sir Magnus would not hear ofthis. He said, and said truly, that the ministerial house was large; andat last he declared the honest truth. His sister-in-law had been verykind to him about money, and had said not a word on that troubledsubject since her arrival. Mrs. Mountjoy, with that delicacy which stillbelongs to some English ladies, would have suffered extreme povertyrather than have spoken on such a matter. In truth she suffered nothing,and hardly thought about it. But Sir Magnus was grateful, and told herthat if she went to look for lodgings he should go to the lodgings andsay that they were not wanted. Therefore Mrs. Mountjoy remained whereshe was, entertaining a feeling of increased good-will toward SirMagnus.Life went on rather sadly with Florence. Anderson was as good as hisword. He pleaded his own cause no farther, telling both Sir Magnus andLady Mountjoy of the pledge he had made. He did in fact tell two orthree other persons, regarding himself as a martyr to chivalry. All thistime he went about his business looking very wretched. But though he didnot speak for himself, he could not hinder others from speaking for him.Sir Magnus took occasion to say a word on the subject once daily to hisniece. Her mother was constant in her attacks. But Lady Mountjoy was theseverest of the three, and was accounted by Florence as her bitterestenemy. The words which passed between them were not the mostaffectionate in the world. Lady Mountjoy would call her 'miss,' to whichFlorence would reply by addressing her aunt as 'my lady.' "Why do youcall me 'my lady?' It isn't usual in common conversation." "Why do youcall me 'miss?' If you cease to call me 'miss,' I'll cease to call you'my lady.'" But no reverence was paid by the girl to the wife of theBritish Minister. It was this that Lady Mountjoy specially felt,--as shecomplained to her companion, Miss Abbott. Then another cause for troublesprang up during the winter, of which mention must be made farther on.The result was that Florence was instant with her mother to take herback to England.We will return, however, to Harry Annesley, and give the letter,verbatim, which he wrote to Florence:"DEAR FLORENCE,--I wonder whether you ever think of me or ever rememberthat I exist? I know you do. I cannot have been forgotten like that. Andyou yourself are the truest girl that ever owned to loving a man. Butthere comes a chill across my heart when I think how long it is since Iwrote to you, and that I have not had a line even to acknowledge myletter. You bade me not to write, and you have not even forgiven me fordisobeying your order. I cannot but get stupid ideas into my mind, whichone word from you would dissipate."Now, however, I must write again, order or no order. Between a man anda woman circumstanced as you and I, things will arise which make itincumbent on one or the other to write. It is absolutely necessary thatyou should now know what are my intentions, and understand the reasonswhich have actuated me. I have found myself left in a most unfortunatecondition by my uncle's folly. He is going on with a stupid marriage forthe purpose of disinheriting me, and has in the mean time stopped theallowance which he had made me since I left college. Of course I have noabsolute claim on him. But I cannot understand how he can reconcilehimself to do so, when he himself prevented my going to the Bar, sayingthat it would be unnecessary."But so it is, I am driven to look about for myself. It is very hard atmy time of life to find an opening in any profession. I think I told youbefore that I had ideas of going to Cambridge and endeavoring to getpupils, trusting to my fellowship rather than to my acquirements. Butthis I have always looked upon with great dislike, and would only havetaken to it if nothing else was to be had. Now there has come forwardan old college acquaintance, a man who is three or four years my senior,who has offered to take me to America as his private secretary. Heproposes to remain there for three years. I of course shall not bindmyself to stay as long; but I may not improbably do so. He is to pay myexpenses and to give me a salary of three hundred a year. This will,perhaps, lead to nothing else, but will for the present be better thannothing. I am to start in just a month from the present time."Now you know it all except that the man's name is Sir William Crook. Heis a decent sort of a fellow, and has got a wife who is to go with him.He is the hardest working man I know, but, between you and me, willnever set the Thames on fire. If the Thames is to be illumined at all, Irather think that I shall be expected to do it."Now, my own one, what am I to say about you, and of myself, as yourhusband that is to be? Will you wait, at any rate, for three years withthe conviction that the three years will too probably end in your havingto wait again?"I do feel that in my altered position I ought to give you back yourtroth, and tell you that things shall be as they used to be before thathappy night at Mrs. Armitage's party. I do not know but that it isclearly my duty. I almost think that it is. But I am sure of this,--thatit is the one thing in the world that I cannot do. I don't think that aman ought to be asked to tear himself altogether in pieces because someone has ill-treated him. At any rate I cannot. If you say that it mustbe so, you shall say it. I don't suppose it will kill me, but it will goa long way."In writing so far I have not said a word of love, because, as far as Iunderstand you, that is a subject on which you expect me to be silent.When you order me not to write, I suppose you intend that I am to writeno love-letters. This, therefore, you will take simply as a matter ofbusiness, and as such, I suppose, you will acknowledge it. In this way Ishall at any rate see your handwriting."Yours affectionately,"HARRY ANNESLEY."Harry, when he had written this letter, considered that it had beencold, calm, and philosophical. He could not go to America for threeyears without telling her of his purpose; nor could he mention thatpurpose, as he thought, in any language less glowing. But Florence, whenshe received it, did not regard it in the same light.To her thinking the letter was full of love, and of love expressed inthe warmest possible language. "Sir William Crook!" she said to herself."What can he want of Harry in America for three years? I am sure he is astupid man. Will I wait? Of course I will wait. What are three years?And why should I not wait? But, for the matter of that--" Then thoughtscame into her mind which even to herself she could not express in words.Sir William Crook had got a wife, and why should not Harry take a wifealso? She did not see why a private secretary should not be a marriedman; and as for money, there would be plenty for such a style of life asthey would live. She could not exactly propose this, but she thoughtthat if she were to see Harry just for one short interview before hestarted, that he might probably then propose it himself."Things be as they used to be!" she exclaimed to herself. "Never! Thingscannot be as they used to be. I know what is his duty. It is his dutynot to think of anything of the kind. Remember that he exists," shesaid, turning back to the earlier words of the letter. "That of courseis his joke. I wonder whether he knows that every moment of my life isdevoted to him. Of course I bade him not to write. But I can tell himnow that I have never gone to bed without his letter beneath my pillow."This and much more of the same kind was uttered in soliloquies, but neednot be repeated at length to the reader.But she had to think what steps she must first take. She must tell hermother of Harry's intention. She had never for an instant allowed hermother to think that her affection had dwindled, or her purpose failedher. She was engaged to marry Harry Annesley, and marry him some day shewould. That her mother should be sure of that was the immediate purposeof her life. And in carrying out that purpose she must acquaint hermother with the news which this letter had brought to her. "Mamma, Ihave got something to tell you.""Well, my dear?""Harry Annesley is going to America!" There was something pleasing toMrs. Mountjoy in the sound of these words. If Harry Annesley went toAmerica he might be drowned, or it might more probably be that he wouldnever come back. America was, to her imagination, a long way off. Loversdid not go to America except with the intention of deserting theirladyloves. Such were her ideas. She felt at the moment that Florencewould be more easily approached in reference either to her cousinMountjoy or to Mr. Anderson. Another lover had sprung up, too, inBrussels, of whom a word shall be said by-and-by. If her Harry, thepernicious Harry, should have taken himself to America, the chances ofall these three gentlemen would be improved. Any one of them would nowbe accepted by Mrs. Mountjoy as a bar fatal to Harry Annesley. Mountjoywas again the favorite with her. She had heard that he had returned toTretton, and was living amicably with his father. She knew, even, of theincome allotted to him for the present,--of the six hundred pounds ayear,--and had told Florence that as a preliminary income it was morethan double that two hundred and fifty pounds which had been taken awayfrom Harry,--taken away never to be restored. There was not much in thisargument, but still she thought well to use it. The captain was livingwith his father, and she did not believe a word about the entail havingbeen done away with. It was certain that Harry's uncle had quarrelledwith him, and she did understand that a baby at Buston would altogetherrob Harry of his chance. And then look at the difference in theproperties! It was thus that she argued the matter. But in truth herword had been pledged to Mountjoy Scarborough, and Mountjoy Scarboroughhad ever been a favorite with her. Though she could talk about themoney, it was not the money that touched her feelings. "Well;--he may goto America. It is a dreadful destiny for a young man, but in his case itmay be the best thing that he can do.""Of course he intends to come back again.""That is as it may be.""I do not understand what you mean by a dreadful destiny, mamma. I don'tsee that it is a destiny at all. He is getting a very good offer for ayear or two, and thinks it best to take it. I might go with him, forthat matter."A thunder-bolt had fallen at Mrs. Mountjoy's feet! Florence go with himto America! Among all the trials which had come upon her with referenceto this young man there had been nothing so bad as this proposal. Gowith him! The young man was to start in a month! Then she began to thinkwhether it would be within her power to stop her daughter. What wouldall the world be to her with one daughter, and she in America, marriedto Harry Annesley? Her quarrel with Florence was not at all as was thequarrel of Lady Mountjoy. Lady Mountjoy would be glad to get rid of thegirl, whom she thought to be impertinent and believed to be false. Butto her mother Florence was the very apple of her eye. It was because shethought that Mountjoy Scarborough was a grand fellow, and because shethought all manner of evil of Harry Annesley, that she wished Florenceto marry her cousin, and to separate herself forever from the other.When she had heard that Harry was to go to America she had rejoiced, asthough he was to be transported to Botany Bay. Her ideas wereold-fashioned. But when it was hinted that Florence was to go with himshe nearly fell to the ground.Florence certainly had behaved badly in making the suggestion. She hadnot intended to make it,--had not, in truth, thought of it. But when hermother talked of Harry's destiny, as though some terrible evil had comeupon him,--as though she were speaking of a poor wretch condemned to behanged, when all chances of a reprieve were over,--then her spirit rosewithin her. She had not meant to say that she was going. Harry had neverasked her to go. "If you talk of his destiny I am quite prepared toshare it with him." That was her meaning. But her mother already saw heronly child in the hands of those American savages. She threw herself onto a sofa, buried her face in her hands, and burst into tears."I don't say that I am going, mamma.""My darling--my dearest--my child!""Only that there is no reason why I shouldn't, except that it would notsuit him. At least I suppose it would not.""Has he said so?""He has said nothing about it.""Thank Heaven for that! He does not intend to rob me of my child.""But, mamma, I am to be his wife.""No, no, no!""It is that that I want to make you understand. You know nothing of hischaracter;--nothing.""I do know that he told a base falsehood.""Nothing of the kind! I will not admit it. It is of no use going intothat again, but there was nothing base about it. He has got anappointment in the United States, and is going out to do the work. Hehas not asked me to go with him. The two things would probably not becompatible." Here Mrs. Mountjoy rose from the sofa and embraced herchild, as though liberated from her deepest grief. "But, mamma, you mustremember this:--that I have given him my word, and will never be inducedto abandon it." Here her mother threw up her hands and again began toweep. "Either to-day or to-morrow, or ten years hence,--if he will waitas long, I will,--we shall be married. As far as I can see we need notwait ten years, or perhaps more than one or two. My money will sufficefor us.""He proposes to live upon you?""He proposes nothing of the kind. He is going to America because he willnot propose it. Nor am I proposing it,--just at present.""At any rate I am glad of that.""And now, mamma, you must take me back home as soon as possible.""When he has started.""No, mamma. I must be there before he starts. I cannot let him gowithout seeing him. If I am to remain here, here he must come.""Your uncle would never receive him.""I should receive him."This was dreadful--this flying into actual disobedience. Whatever didshe mean? Where was she to receive him? "How could you receive a youngman in opposition to the wishes, and indeed to the commands, of all yourfriends?""I'm not going to be at all shamefaced about it, mamma. I am the womanhe has selected to be his wife, and he is the man I have selected to bemy husband. If he were coming I should go to my uncle and ask to havehim received.""Think of your aunt.""Yes; I do think of her. My aunt would make herself very disagreeable.Upon the whole, mamma, I think it would be best that you should take meback to England. There is this M. Grascour here, who is a great trouble,and you may be sure of this, that I intend to see Harry Annesley beforehe starts for America."So the interview was ended; but Mrs. Mountjoy was left greatly in doubtas to what she might best do. She felt sure that were Annesley to cometo Brussels, Florence would see him,--would see him in spite of all thather uncle and aunt, and Mr. Anderson, and M. Grascour could do toprevent it. That reprobate young man would force his way into theembassy, or Florence would force her way out. In either case there wouldbe a terrible scene. But if she were to take Florence back toCheltenham, interviews to any extent would be arranged for her at thehouse of Mrs. Armitage. As she thought of all this, the idea came acrossher that when a young girl is determined to be married nothing canprevent it.Florence in the mean time wrote an immediate answer to her lover, asfollows:"DEAR HARRY,--Of course you were entitled to write when there wassomething to be said which it was necessary that I should know. When youhave simply to say that you love me, I know that well enough without anyfarther telling."Go to America for three years! It is very, very serious. But of courseyou must know best, and I shall not attempt to interfere. What are threeyears to you and me? If we were rich people, of course we should notwait; but as we are poor, of course we must act as do other people whoare poor. I have about four hundred a year; and it is for you to say howfar that may be sufficient. If you think so, you will not find that Ishall want more."But there is one thing necessary before you start. I must see you.There is no reason on earth for our remaining here, except that mammahas not made up her mind. If she will consent to go back before youstart, it will be best so. Otherwise, you must take the trouble to comehere,--where, I am afraid, you will not be received as a welcome guest. Ihave told mamma that if I cannot see you here in a manner that isbecoming, I shall go out and meet you in the streets, in a manner thatis unbecoming."Your affectionate--wife that is to be,"FLORENCE MOUNTJOY."This letter she took to her mother, and read aloud to her in her ownroom. Mrs. Mountjoy could only implore that it might not be sent, butprevailed not at all. "There is not a word in it about love," saidFlorence. "It is simply a matter of business, and as such I must sendit. I do not suppose my uncle will go to the length of attempting tolock me up. He would, I think, find it difficult to do so." There was alook in Florence's face as she said this which altogether silenced hermother. She did not think that Sir Magnus would consent to lock Florenceup, and she did think that were he to attempt to do so he would find thetask very difficult.CHAPTER XLVI.M. GRASCOUR.M. Grascour was a Belgian, about forty years old, who looked as thoughhe were no more than thirty, except that his hair was in patchesbeginning to be a little gray. He was in the government service of hiscountry, well educated, and thoroughly a gentleman. As is the case withmany Belgians, he would have been taken to be an Englishman were hiscountry not known. He had dressed himself in English mirrors, livingmostly with the English. He spoke English so well that he would only beknown to be a foreigner by the correctness of his language. He was a manof singularly good temper, and there was running through all that he didsomewhat of a chivalric spirit, which came from study rather thannature. He had looked into things and seen whether they were good, or atany rate popular, and endeavored to grasp and to make his own whateverhe found to be so. He was hitherto unmarried, and was regarded generallyby his friends as a non-marrying man. But Florence Mountjoy was powerfulover him, and he set to work to make her his wife. He was intimate atthe house of Sir Magnus, and saw, no doubt, that Anderson was doing thesame thing. But he saw also that Anderson did not succeed. He had toldhimself from the first that if Anderson did succeed he would not wish todo so. The girl who would be satisfied with Anderson would hardlycontent him. He remained therefore quiet till he saw that Anderson hadfailed. The young man at once took to an altered mode of life which wassufficiently marked. He went, like Sir Proteus, ungartered. Everythingabout him had of late "demonstrated a careless desolation." All this M.Grascour observed, and when he saw it he felt that his own time hadcome.He took occasion at first to wait upon Lady Mountjoy. He believed thatto be the proper way of going to work. He was very intimate with theMountjoys, and was aware that his circumstances were known to them.There was no reason, on the score of money, why he should not marry theniece of Sir Magnus. He had already shown some attention to Florence,which, though it had excited no suspicion in her mind, had been seen andunderstood by her aunt; and it had been understood also by Mr. Anderson."That accursed Belgian! If, after all, she should take up with him! Ishall tell her a bit of my mind if anything of that kind should occur.""My niece, M. Grascour!""Yes, my lady." M. Grascour had not quite got over the way of callingLady Mountjoy "my lady." "It is presumption, I know.""Not at all.""I have not spoken to her. Nor would I do so till I had first addressedmyself to you or to her mother. May I speak to Mrs. Mountjoy?""Oh, certainly. I do not in the least know what the young lady's ideasare. She has been much admired here and elsewhere, and that may haveturned her head.""I think not.""You may be the better judge, M. Grascour.""I think that Miss Mountjoy's head has not been turned by anyadmiration. She does not appear to be a young lady whose head wouldeasily be turned. It is her heart of which I am thinking." The interviewended by Lady Mountjoy passing the Belgian lover on to Mrs. Mountjoy."Florence!" said Mrs. Mountjoy."Yes, Mrs. Mountjoy;--I have the great honor of asking your permission. Iam well known to Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy, and they can tell whatare my circumstances. I am forty years of age.""Oh yes; everything is, I am sure, quite as it should be. But mydaughter thinks about these things for herself." Then there was a pause,and M. Grascour was about to leave the room, having obtained thepermission he desired, when Mrs. Mountjoy thought it well to acquainthim with something of her daughter's condition. "I ought to tell youthat my daughter has been engaged.""Indeed!""Yes; and I hardly know how to explain the circumstances. I should saythat she had been promised to her cousin, Captain Scarborough; but tothis she will not give her assent. She has since met a gentleman, Mr.Annesley, for whom she professes an attachment. Neither can I, nor canher uncle and aunt, hear of Mr. Annesley as a husband for Florence. Sheis therefore at present disengaged. If you can gain her affections, youhave my leave." With this permission M. Grascour departed, professinghimself to be contented.He did not see Florence for two or three days, no doubt leaving thematter to be discussed with her by her mother and her aunt. To him itwas quite indifferent what might be the fate of Captain Scarborough, orof Mr. Annesley, or indeed of Mr. Anderson. And, to tell the truth, hewas not under any violent fear or hope as to his own fate. He admiredMiss Mountjoy, and thought it would be well to secure for a wife such agirl, with such a fortune as would belong to her. But he did not intendto go "ungartered," nor yet to assume an air of "desolation." If shewould come to him, it would be well; if she would not, why, it wouldstill be well. The only outward difference made by his love was that hebrushed his clothes and his hair a little more carefully, and had hisboots brought to a higher state of polish than was usual.Her mother spoke to her first. "My dear, M. Grascour is a most excellentman.""I am sure he is, mamma.""And he is a great friend to your uncle and Lady Mountjoy.""Why do you say this, mamma? What can it matter to me?""My dear, M. Grascour wishes you to--to--to become his wife.""Oh, mamma, why didn't you tell him that it is impossible?""How was I to know, my dear?""Mamma, I am engaged to marry Harry Annesley, and no word shall everturn me from that purpose, unless it be spoken by himself. The crier maysay that all round the town if he wishes. You must know that it is so.What can be the use of sending M. Grascour or any other gentleman to me?It is only giving me pain and him too. I wish, mamma, you could be gotto understand this." But Mrs. Mountjoy could not altogether be got asyet to understand the obstinacy of her daughter's character.There was one point on which Florence received information from thesetwo suitors who had come to her at Brussels. They were both favored, oneafter the other, by her mother; and would not have been so favored hadher mother absolutely believed in Captain Mountjoy. It seemed to her asthough her mother would be willing that she should marry any one, solong as it was not Harry Annesley. "It is a pity that there should besuch a difference," she said to herself. "But we will see what firmnesscan do."Then Lady Mountjoy spoke to her. "You have heard of M. Grascour, mydear?""Yes; I have heard of him, aunt.""He intends to do you the honor of asking you to be his wife.""So mamma tells me.""I have only to say that he is a man most highly esteemed here. He iswell known at the court, and is at the royal parties. Should you becomehis wife, you would have all the society of Brussels at your feet.""All the society of Brussels would do no good.""Perhaps not.""Nor the court and the royal parties.""If you choose to be impertinent when I tell you what are his advantagesand condition in life, I cannot help it.""I do not mean to be impertinent.""What you say about the royal parties and the court is intended forimpertinence, knowing as you do know your uncle's position.""Not at all. You know my position. I am engaged to marry another man,and cannot therefore marry M. Grascour. Why should he be sent to me,except that you won't believe me when I tell you that I am engaged?"Then she marched out of the room, and considered within her own bosomwhat answer she would give to this new Belgian suitor.She was made perfectly aware when the Belgian suitor was about toarrive. On the day but one after the interview with her aunt she wasleft alone when the other ladies went out, and suspected that even thefootmen knew what was to happen, when M. Grascour was shown into thedrawing-room. There was a simple mode of dealing with the matter on hispart,--very different from that state of agitation into which Harry hadbeen thrown when he had made his proposition. She was quite prepared toadmit that M. Grascour's plan might be the wisest; but Harry's mannerhad been full of real love, and had charmed her. M. Grascour was not inthe least flustered, whereas poor Harry had been hardly able to speakhis mind. But it had not mattered much whether Harry spoke his mind ornot, whereas all the eloquence in the world could have done no good forM. Grascour. Florence had known that Harry did love her, whereas of M.Grascour she only knew that he wanted to make her his wife."Miss Mountjoy," he said, "I am charmed to find you here. Allow me toadd that I am charmed to find you alone." Florence, who knew all aboutit, only bowed. She had to go through it, and thought that she would beable to do so with equanimity. "I do not know whether your aunt or yourmother have done me the honor of mentioning my name to you.""They have both spoken to me.""I thought it best that they should have the opportunity of doing so. Inour country these things are arranged chiefly by the lady's friends.With your people I know it is different. Perhaps it is much better thatit should be so in a matter in which the heart has to be concerned.""It would come to the same thing with me. I must decide for myself.""I am sure of it. May I venture to feel a hope that ultimately thatdecision may not go against me?" M. Grascour, as he said this, did throwsome look of passion into his face. "But I have spoken nothing as yet ofmy own feelings.""It is unnecessary."This might be taken in either one of two senses; but the gentleman wasnot sufficiently vain to think that the lady had intended to signify tohim that she would accept his love as a thing of which she could have nodoubt. "Ah, Miss Mountjoy," he continued, "if you would allow me to saythat since you have been at Brussels not a day has passed in whichmingled love and respect have not grown within my bosom. I have sat byand watched while my excellent young friend Mr. Anderson has endeavoredto express his feelings. I have said to myself that I would bide mytime. If you could give yourself to him, why then the aspiration shouldbe quenched within my own breast. But you have not done so, though, as Iam aware, he has been assisted by my friend Sir Magnus. I have seen, andhave heard, and have said to myself at last, 'Now, too, my turn maycome.' I have loved much, but I have been very patient. Can it be thatmy turn should have come at last?" Though he had spoken of Mr. Anderson,he had not thought it expedient to say a word either of CaptainScarborough or of Mr. Annesley. He knew quite as much of them as he didof Mr. Anderson. He was clever, and had put together with absolutecorrectness what Mrs. Mountjoy had told him, with other little factswhich had reached his ears."M. Grascour, I suppose I am very much obliged to you. I ought to be."Here he bowed his head. "But my only way of being grateful is to tellyou the truth." Again he bowed his head. "I am in love with another man.That's the truth." Here he shook his head with the smallest possibleshake, as though deprecating her love, but not doing so with anyharshness. "I engaged to marry him, too." There was another shake of thehead, somewhat more powerful. "And I intend to marry him." This she saidwith much bold assurance. "All my old friends know that it is so, andought not to have sent you to me. I have given a promise to HarryAnnesley, and Harry Annesley alone can make me depart from it." This shesaid in a low voice, but almost with violence, because there had comeanother shake of the head in reply to her assurance that she meant tomarry Annesley. "And though he were to make me depart from it,--which hewill never do,--I should be just the same as regards anybody else. Can'tyou understand that when a girl has given herself, heart and soul, to aman, she won't change?""Girls do change--sometimes.""You may know them; I don't,--not girls that are worth anything.""But when all your friends are hostile?""What can they do? They can't make me marry another person. They mayhinder my happiness; but they can't hand me over, like a parcel ofgoods, to any one else. Do you mean to say that you would accept such aparcel?""Oh yes--such a parcel!""You would accept a girl who would come to you telling you that sheloved another man? I don't believe it of you.""I should know that my tenderness would beget tenderness in you.""It wouldn't do anything of the kind. It would be all horror,--horror. Ishould kill myself, or else you, or perhaps both.""Is your aversion so strong?""No, not at all;--not at present. I like you very much. I do indeed. I'ddo anything for you--in the way of friendship. I believe you to be areal gentleman.""But you would kill me!""You make me talk of a condition of things which is quite, quiteimpossible. When I say that I like you, I am talking of the presentcondition of things. I have not the least desire to kill you, or myself,or anybody. I want to be taken back to England, and there to be allowedto marry Mr. Henry Annesley. That's what I want. But I intend to remainengaged to him. That's my purpose, and no man and no woman shall stir mefrom it." He smiled, and again shook his head, and she began to doubtwhether she did like him so much. "Now I've told you all about myself,"she said, rising to her feet. "You may believe me or not, as you please;but, as I have believed you, I have told you all." Then she walked outof the room.M. Grascour, as soon as he was alone, left the room and the house, and,making his way into the park, walked round it twice, turning in his mindhis success and his want of success. For, in truth, he was not at alldispirited by what had occurred. With her other Belgian lover,--that is,with Mr. Anderson,--Florence had at any rate succeeded in making thetruth appear to be the truth. He did believe that she had taken such afancy to that "fellow Harry Annesley" that there would be no overcomingit. He had got a glimpse into the firmness of her character which wasdenied to M. Grascour. M. Grascour, as he walked up and down the shadypaths of the park, told himself that such events as this so-called loveon the part of Florence were very common in the lives of English youngladies. "They are the best in the world," he said to himself, "and theymake the most charming wives; but their education is such that there isno preventing these accidents." The passion displayed in the younglady's words he attributed solely to her power of expression. One girlwould use language such as had been hers, and such a girl would beclever, eloquent, and brave; another girl would hum and haw, with half a"yes" and a quarter of a "no," and would mean just the same thing. Hedid not doubt but that she had engaged herself to Harry Annesley; nordid he doubt that she had been brought to Brussels to break off thatengagement; and he thought it most probable that her friends wouldprevail. Under these circumstances, why should he despair?--or why,rather, as he was a man not given to despair, should he not think thatthere was for him a reasonable chance of success? He must show himselfto be devoted, true, and not easily repressed.She had used, he did not doubt, the same sort of language in silencingAnderson. Mr. Anderson had accepted her words, but he knew too well thevalue of words coming from a young lady's mouth to take them at theirtrue meaning. He had at this interview affected a certain amount ofintimacy with Florence of which he thought that he appreciated thevalue. She had told him that she would kill him,--of course in joke; anda joke from a girl on such an occasion was worth much. No Belgian girlwould have joked. But then he was anxious to marry Florence becauseFlorence was English. Therefore, when he went back to his own home hedirected that the system of the high polish should be continued with hisboots."I don't suppose he will come again," Florence had said to her mother,misunderstanding the character of her latest lover quite as widely as hemisunderstood hers. But M. Grascour, though he did not absolutely renewhis offer at once, gave it to be understood that he did not at allwithdraw from the contest. He obtained permission from Lady Mountjoy tobe constantly at the Embassy, and succeeded even in obtaining a promiseof support from Sir Magnus. "You're quite up a tree," Sir Magnus hadsaid to his Secretary of Legation. "It's clear she won't look at you.""I have pledged myself to abstain," said poor Anderson, in a tone whichseemed to confess that all chance was over with him."I suppose she must marry some one, and I don't see why Grascour shouldnot have as good a chance as another." Anderson had stalked away,brooding over the injustice of his position, and declaring to himselfthat this Belgian should never be allowed to marry Florence Mountjoy inpeace.But M. Grascour continued his attentions; and this it was which hadinduced Florence to tell her mother that the Belgian was "a greattrouble," which ought to be avoided by a return to England.CHAPTER XLVII.FLORENCE BIDS FAREWELL TO HER LOVERS."Mamma, had you not better take me back to Cheltenham at once?""Has that unfortunate young man written to you?""Yes. The young man whom you call unfortunate has written. Of course Icannot agree to have him so called. And, to tell the truth, I don'tthink he is so very unfortunate. He has got a girl who really loves him,and that, I think, is a step to happiness."Every word of this was said by Florence as though with the purpose ofprovoking her mother; and so did Mrs. Mountjoy feel it. But behind thispurpose there was that other fixed resolution to get Harry at lastaccepted as her husband, and perhaps the means taken were the best. MrsMountjoy was already beginning to feel that there would be nothing forher but to give up the battle, and to open her motherly arms to HarryAnnesley. Sir Magnus had told her that M. Grascour would probablyprevail. M. Grascour was said to be exactly the man likely to beeffective with such a girl as Florence. That had been the last opinionexpressed by Sir Magnus. But Mrs. Mountjoy had found no comfort in it.Florence was going to have her own way. Her mother knew that it was so,and was very unhappy. But she was still anxious to continue a weak,ineffective battle. "It was very impertinent of him writing," she said."When he was going to America for years! Dear mamma, do put yourself inmy place. How was it possible that he should not write?""A young man has no business to come and insinuate himself into a familyin that way; and then, when he knows he is not welcome, to open acorrespondence.""But, mamma, he knows that he is welcome. If he had gone to Americawithout writing to me--Oh, it would have been impossible! I should havegone after him.""No,--no;--never!""I am quite in earnest, mamma. But it is no good talking about whatcould not have taken place.""We ought to have prevented you from receiving or sending letters." HereMrs. Mountjoy touched on a subject on which the practice of the Englishworld has been much altered during the last thirty or fortyyears;--perhaps we may say fifty or sixty years. Fifty years ago youngladies were certainly not allowed to receive letters as they chose, andto write them, and to demand that this practice should be carried onwithout any supervision from their elder friends. It is now usually thecase that they do so. A young lady, before she falls into acorrespondence with a young man, is expected to let it be understoodthat she does so. But she does not expect that his letters, eithercoming or going, shall be subject to any espial, and she generally feelsthat the option of obeying or disobeying the instructions given to herrests with herself. Practically the use of the post-office is in her ownhands. And, as this spirit of self-conduct has grown up, the morals andhabits of our young ladies have certainly not deteriorated. In Americathey carry latch-keys, and walk about with young gentlemen as younggentlemen walk about with each other. In America the young ladies are aswell-behaved as with us,--as well-behaved as they are in some Continentalcountries in which they are still watched close till they are given upas brides to husbands with whom they have had no means of becomingacquainted. Whether the latch-key system, or that of freecorrespondence, may not rob the flowers of some of that delicate aromawhich we used to appreciate, may be a question; but then it is also aquestion whether there does not come something in place of it which inthe long-run is found to be more valuable. Florence, when this remarkwas made as to her own power of sending and receiving letters, remainedsilent, but looked very firm. She thought that it would have beendifficult to silence her after this fashion. "Sir Magnus could have doneit, at any rate, if I had not been able.""Sir Magnus could have done nothing, I think, which would not have beenwithin your power. But it is useless talking of this. Will you not takeme back to England, so as to prevent the necessity of Harry cominghere?""Why should he come?""Because, mamma, I intend to see my future husband before he goes fromme for so great a distance, and for so long a time. Don't you feel anypity for me, mamma?""Do you feel pity for me?""Because one day you wish me to marry my cousin Scarborough, and thenext Mr. Anderson, and then the next M. Grascour? How can I pity you forthat? It is all done because you have taken it in your head to think illof one whom I believe to be especially worthy. You began by dislikinghim, because he interfered with your plans about Mountjoy. I never wouldhave married my cousin Mountjoy. He is not to my taste, and he is agambler. But you have thought that you could do what you liked with me.""It has always been for your own happiness.""But I must be the judge of that. How could I be happy with any of thesemen, seeing that I do not care for them in the least? It would beutterly impossible for me to have myself married to either of them. ToHarry Annesley I have given myself altogether; but you, because you aremy mother, are able to keep us apart. Do you not pity me for the sorrowand trouble which I must suffer?""I suppose a mother always pities the sufferings of a child.""And removes them when she can do so. But now, mamma, is he to comehere, or will you take me back to England?"This was a question which Mrs. Mountjoy found it very difficult toanswer. On the spur of the moment she could not answer it, as it wouldbe necessary that she should first consult Sir Magnus. Could Sir Magnusundertake to confine her daughter within the precincts of the Embassy,and to exclude the lover during such time as Harry Annesley night remainin Brussels?As she thought of the matter in her own room she conceived that therewould be a great difficulty. All the world of Brussels would becomeaware of what was going on. The young lady would endeavor to get out,and could only be constrained by the co-operation of the servants; andthe young gentleman, in his endeavors to get in, could only be preventedby the assistance of the police. Dim ideas presented themselves to hermind of farther travel. But wherever she went there would be apost-office, and she was aware that the young man could pursue her muchquicker than she could fly. How good it would be that in such anemergency she might have the privilege of locking her daughter up insome convent! And yet it must be a Protestant convent, as all thingssavoring of the Roman Catholic religion were abhorrent to her.Altogether, as she thought of her own condition and that of herdaughter, she felt that the world was sadly out of joint."Coming here, is he?" said Sir Magnus. "Then he will just have to goback again as wise as he came.""But can you shut your doors against him?""Shut my doors! Of course I can. He'll never be able to get his nose inhere if once an order has been given for his exclusion. Who's Mr.Annesley? I don't suppose he knows an Englishman in Brussels.""But she will go out to meet him.""What! in the streets?" said Sir Magnus, in horror."I fear she would.""By George! she must be a stiff-necked one if she'll do that." Then Mrs.Mountjoy, with tears in her eyes, began to explain with very manyepithets that her daughter was the best girl in all the world. She wasentirely worthy of confidence. Those who knew her were aware that nobetter behaved young woman could exist. She was conscientious,religious, and high-principled. "But she'll go out in the streets andwalk with a young man when all her friends tell her not. Is that heridea of religion?" Then Mrs. Mountjoy, with some touch of anger in thetone of her voice, said that she would return to England, and carry herdaughter with her. "What the deuce can I do, Sarah, when the young ladyis so unruly? I can give orders to have him shut out, and can take carethat they are obeyed; but I cannot give orders to have her shut in. Ishould be making her a prisoner, and everybody would talk about it. Inthat matter you must give her the orders;--only you say that she wouldnot comply with them."On the following day Mrs. Mountjoy informed her daughter that they wouldgo back to Cheltenham. She did not name an immediate day, because itwould be well, she thought, to stave off the evil hour. Nor did she namea distant day, because, were she to do so, the terrible evil of HarryAnnesley's arrival in Brussels would not be prevented. At first shewished to name no day, thinking that it would be a good thing to crossHarry on the road. But here Florence was too strong for her, and at lasta day was fixed. In a week's time they would take their departure and gohome by slow stages. With this arrangement Florence expressed herselfwell pleased, and of course made Harry acquainted with the probable timeof their arrival.M. Grascour, when he heard that the day had been suddenly fixed for thedeparture of Mrs. Mountjoy and her daughter, not unnaturally conceivedthat he himself was the cause of the ladies' departure. Nor did he onthat account resign all hope. The young lady's mother was certainly onhis side, and he thought it quite possible that were he to appear inEngland he might be successful. But when he had heard of her comingdeparture of course it was necessary that he should say some specialfarewell. He dined one evening at the British Embassy, and took anopportunity during the evening of finding himself alone with Florence."And so, Miss Florence," he said, "you and your estimable mamma areabout to return to England?""We have been here a very long time, and are going home at last.""It seems to me but the other day when you came." said M. Grascour, withall a lover's eagerness."It was in autumn, and the weather was quite mild and soft. Now we arein the middle of January.""I suppose so. But still the time has gone only too rapidly. The heartcan hardly take account of days and weeks." As this was decidedlylover's talk, and was made in terms which even a young lady cannotpretend to misunderstand, Florence was obliged to answer it in somemanner equally direct. And now she was angry with him. She had informedhim that she was in love with another man. In doing so she had done muchmore than the necessity of the case demanded, and had told him, as thebest way of silencing him, that which she might have been expected tokeep as her own secret. And yet here he was talking to her about hisheart! She made him no immediate answer, but frowned at him and lookedstern. It was clear to her intelligence that he had no right to talk toher about his heart after the information she had given him. "I hope,Miss Mountjoy, that I may look forward to the pleasure of seeing youwhen I go over to England.""But we don't live in London, or near it. We live down in thecountry--at Cheltenham.""Distance would be nothing."This was very bad, and must be stopped, thought Florence. "I suppose Ishall be married by that time. I don't know where we may live, but Ishall be happy to see you if you call."She had here made a bold assertion, and one which M. Grascour did not atall believe. He was speaking of a visit which he might make, perhaps, ina month or six weeks, and the young lady told him that he would find hermarried! And yet, as he knew very well, her mother and her uncle and heraunt were all opposed to this marriage. And she spoke of it without ablush,--without any reticence! Young ladies were much emancipated, but hedid not think that they generally carried their emancipation so far asthis. "I hope not that," he said."I don't know why you should be so ill-natured as to hope it. The factis, M. Grascour, you don't believe what I told you the other day.Perhaps as a young lady I ought not to have alluded to it, but I did soin order to set the matter at rest altogether. Of course I can't tellwhen you may come. If you come quite at once I shall not be married.""No;--not married.""But I shall be as much engaged as is possible for a girl to be. I havegiven my word, and nothing will make me false to it. I don't suppose youwill come on my account.""Solely on your account.""Then stay at home. I am quite in earnest. And now I must say good-bye."She departed, and left him seated alone on the sofa. He at first toldhimself that she was unfeminine. There was a hard way with her oftalking about herself which he almost pronounced to be unladylike. Anunmarried girl should, he thought, under no circumstances speak of thegentleman to whom her affections had been given as Miss Mountjoy spokeof Mr. Annesley. But nevertheless he would sooner possess her as his ownwife than any other girl he had ever met. Something of the real passionof unsatisfied love made him feel chill at his heart. Who was this HarryAnnesley, for whom she professed so warm a feeling? Her mother declaredHarry Annesley to be a scapegrace, and something of the story of adiscreditable midnight street quarrel between him and the young lady'scousin had reached his ears. He did not suppose it to be possible thatthe young lady could actually get married without her mother'sco-operation, and therefore he thought that he still would go toEngland. In one respect he was altogether untouched. If he couldultimately succeed in marrying the young lady, she would not be a bitthe worse as his wife because she had been attached to Harry Annesley.That was a kind of folly which a girl could very quickly get over whenshe had not been allowed to have her own way. Therefore, upon the whole,he thought that he would go to England.But the parting with Anderson had also to be endured, and mustnecessarily be more difficult. She owed him a debt for having abstained,and she could not go without paying the debt by some expression ofgratitude. That she would have done so had he kept aloof was a matter ofcourse; but equally a matter of course was it that he would not keepaloof. "I shall want to see you for just five minutes to-morrow morningbefore you take your departure," he said, in a lugubrious voice, duringher last evening.He had kept his promise to the very letter, mooning about in hisdesolate manner very conspicuously. The desolation had been notorious,and very painful to Florence,--but the promise had been kept, and she wasgrateful. "Oh, certainly, if you wish it," she said."I do wish it." Then he made an appointment and she promised to keep it.It was in the ball-room, a huge chamber, very convenient for itsintended purpose, and always handsome at night-time, but looking asdesolate in the morning as did poor Anderson himself. He was stalking upand down the long room when she entered it, and being at the fartherend, stalked up to her and addressed her with words which he had chosenfor the purpose. "Miss Mountjoy," he said, "you found me here a happy,light-hearted young man.""I hope I leave you soon to be the same, in spite of this littleaccident."He did not say that he was a blighted being, because the word had, hethought, become ridiculous; but he would have used it had he dared, asexpressing most accurately his condition."A cloud has passed over me, and its darkness will never be effaced. Ithas certainly been your doing.""Oh, Mr. Anderson! what can I say?""I have loved before,--but never like this.""And so you will again.""Never! When I declare that, I expect my word to be respected," Hepaused for an answer, but what could she say? She did not at all respecthis word on such a subject, but she did respect his conduct. "Yes; Icall upon you to believe me when I say that for me all that is over. Butit can be nothing to you.""It will be very much to me.""I shall go on in the same disconsolate, miserable way, I suppose Ishall stay here, because I shall be as well here as anywhere else. Imight move to Lisbon,--but what good would that do me? Your image wouldfollow me to whatever capital I might direct my steps. But there is onething you can do." Here he brightened up, putting on quite an alteredface."I will do anything, Mr. Anderson--in my power.""If--if--if you should change--""I shall never change!" she said, with an angry look."If you should change, I think you should remember the promise youexacted and the fidelity with which it has been kept.""I do remember it.""And then I should be allowed to come again and have my chance. WhereverI may be, at the court of the Shah of Persia or at the Chinese capital,I will instantly come. I promised you when you asked me. Will you notnow promise me?""I cannot promise anything--so impossible.""It will bind you to nothing but to let me know that Mr. Annesley hasgone his way." But she had to explain to him that it was impossible sheshould make any promise founded on the idea that Mr. Henry Annesleyshould ever go any way in which she would not accompany him. With thathe had to be as well satisfied as the circumstances of the case wouldadmit, and he left her with an assurance, not intended to be quiteaudible, that he was and ever should be a blighted individual.When the carriage was at the door Sir Magnus came down into the hall,full of smiles and good-humor; but at that moment Lady Mountjoy wassaying a last word of farewell to her relatives in her own chamber."Good-bye, my dear; I hope you will get well through all your troubles."This was addressed to Mrs. Mountjoy. "And as for you, my dear," shesaid, turning to Florence, "if you would only contrive to be a littleless stiff-necked, I think the world would go easier with you.""I think my stiff neck, aunt, as you call it, is what I have chiefly todepend upon,--I mean in reference to other advice than mamma's. Good-bye,aunt.""Good-bye, Florence." And the two parted, hating each other as onlyfemale enemies can hate. But Florence, when she was in the carriage,threw herself on to her mother's neck and kissed her.CHAPTER XLVIII.MR. PROSPER CHANGES HIS MIND.When Florence with her mother reached Cheltenham she found a letterlying for her, which surprised her much. The the letter was from Harry,and seemed to have been written in better spirits than he had latelydisplayed. But it was very short:"DEAREST FLORENCE,--When can I come down? It is absolutely necessarythat I should see you. All my plans are likely to be changed in the mostextraordinary manner."Nobody can say that this is a love-letter."Yours affectionately, H. A."Florence, of course, showed the letter to her mother, who was muchfrightened by its contents. "What am I to say to him when he comes?" sheexclaimed."If you will be so very, very good as to see him you must not sayanything unkind.""Unkind! How can I say anything else than what you would call unkind? Idisapprove of him altogether. And he is coming here with the expressobject of taking you away from me.""Oh no;--not at once.""But at some day,--which I trust may be very distant. How can I speak tohim kindly when I feel that he is my enemy?" But the matter was at lastset at rest by a promise from Florence that she would not marry herlover in less than three years without her mother's express consent.Three years is a long time, was Mrs. Mountjoy's thought, and many thingsmight occur within that term. Harry, of whom she thought all manner ofunnatural things, might probably in that time have proved himself to beutterly unworthy. And Mountjoy Scarborough might again have come forwardin the light of the world. She had heard of late that Mountjoy had beenreceived once more into his father's full favor. And the old man hadbecome so enormously rich through the building of mills which had beengoing on at Tretton, that, as Mrs. Mountjoy thought, he would be able tomake any number of elder sons. On the subject of entail her ideas weremisty; but she felt sure that Mountjoy Scarborough would even yet becomea rich man. That Florence should be made to change on that account shedid not expect. But she did think that when she should have learned thatHarry was a murderer, or a midnight thief, or a wicked conspirator, shewould give him up. Therefore she agreed to receive him with not actuallyexpressed hostility when he should call at Montpelier Place.But now, in the proper telling of our story, we must go back to HarryAnnesley himself. It will be remembered that his father had called uponMr. Prosper, to inform him of Harry's projected journey to America; thatMountjoy Scarborough had also called at Buston Hall; and that previousto these two visits old Mr. Scarborough had himself written a longletter giving a detailed account of the conflict which had taken placein the London streets. These three events had operated strongly on Mr.Prosper's mind; but not so strongly as the conduct of Miss Thoroughbungand Messrs. Soames & Simpson. It had been made evident to him, from thejoint usage which he had received from these persons, that he was simply"made use of," with the object of obtaining from him the best possibleestablishment for the lady in question.After that interview, at which the lady, having obtained in way ofjointure much more than was due to her, demanded also for Miss Tickle alife-long home, and for herself a pair of ponies, he received a fartherletter from the lawyers. This offended him greatly. Nothing on earthshould induce him to write a line to Messrs. Soames & Simpson. Nor didhe see his way to writing again to Messrs. Grey & Barry about suchtrifles as those contained in the letter from the Buntingford lawyers.Trifles to him they were not; but trifles they must become, if put intoa letter addressed to a London firm. "Our client is anxious to knowspecifically that she is to be allowed to bring Miss Tickle with her,when she removes to Buston Hall. Her happiness depends greatly on thecompany of Miss Tickle, to which she had been used now for many years.Our client wishes to be assured also that she shall be allowed to keep apair of ponies in addition to the carriage-horses, which will bemaintained, no doubt, chiefly for your own purposes." These were thedemands as made by Messrs. Soames & Simpson, and felt by Mr. Prosper tobe altogether impossible. He recollected the passionate explosion ofwrath to which the name of Miss Tickle had already brought him inpresence of the clergyman of his parish. He would endure no fartherdisgrace on behalf of Miss Tickle. Miss Tickle should never be an inmateof his house, and as for the ponies, no pony should ever be stabled inhis stalls. A pony was an animal which of its very nature wasobjectionable to him. There was a want of dignity in a pony to whichBuston Hall should never be subjected. "And also," he said to himself atlast, "there is a lack of dignity about Miss Thoroughbung herself whichwould do me an irreparable injury."But how should he make known his decision to the lady herself? and howshould he escape from the marriage in such a manner as to leave no stainon his character as a gentleman? If he could have offered her a sum ofmoney, he would have done so at once; but that he thought would not begentleman-like,--and would be a confession on his own part that he hadbehaved wrongly.At last he determined to take no notice of the lawyers' letter, andhimself to write to Miss Thoroughbung, telling her that the objectswhich they proposed to themselves by marriage were not compatible, andthat therefore their matrimonial intentions must be allowed to subside.He thought it well over, and felt assured that very much of the successof such a measure must depend upon the wording of the letter. There needbe no immediate haste. Miss Thoroughbung would not come to Buston againquite at once to disturb him by a farther visit. Before she would comehe would have flown to Italy. The letter must be courteous, and somewhattender, but it must be absolutely decisive. There must be no loop-holeleft by which she could again entangle him, no crevice by which shecould creep into Buston. The letter should be a work of time. He wouldgive himself a week or ten days for composing it. And then, when itshould have been sent, he would be off to Italy.But before he could allow himself to go upon his travels he must settlethe question about his nephew, which now lay heavy upon his conscience.He did feel that he had ill treated the young man. He had been so toldin very strong language by Mr. Scarborough of Tretton, and Mr.Scarborough of Tretton was a man of very large property, and much talkedabout in the world. Very wonderful things were said about Mr.Scarborough, but they all tended to make Mr. Prosper believe that he wasa man of distinction. And he had also heard lately about Mr.Scarborough's younger son,--or, indeed, his only son, according to thenew way of speaking of him,--tidings which were not much in that youngman's favor. It was from Augustus Scarborough that he had heard thoseevil stories about his own nephew. Therefore his belief was shaken; andit was by no means clear to him that there could be any other heir fortheir property.Miss Thoroughbung had proved herself to be altogether unfit for the highhonor he had intended her. Miss Puffle had gone off with FarmerTazlehurst's son. Mr. Prosper did not think that he had energy enough tolook for a third lady who might be fit at all points to become his wife.And now another evil had been added to all these. His nephew haddeclared his purpose of emigrating to the United States and becoming anAmerican. It might be true that he should be driven to do so by absolutewant. He, Mr. Prosper, had stopped his allowance, and had done so afterdeterring him from following any profession by which he might haveearned his bread. He had looked into the law, and, as far as he couldunderstand it, Buston must become the property of his nephew, eventhough his nephew should become an American citizen. His consciencepricked him sorely as he thought of the evil which might thus accrue,and of the disgrace which would be attached to his own name. Hetherefore wrote the following letter to his nephew, and sent it acrossto the parsonage, done up in a large envelope, and sealed carefully withthe Buston arms. And on the corner of the envelope "Peter Prosper" waswritten very legibly:"MY DEAR NEPHEW, HENRY ANNESLEY,--"Under existing circumstances you will, I think, be surprised at aletter written in my handwriting; but facts have arisen which make itexpedient that I should address you."You are about, I am informed, to proceed to the United States, acountry against which I acknowledge I entertain a serious antipathy.They are not a gentlemanlike people, and I am given to understand thatthey are generally dishonest in all their dealings. Their President is alow person, and all their ideas of government are pettifogging. Theirladies, I am told, are very vulgar, though I have never had the pleasureof knowing one of them. They are an irreligious nation, and have norespect for the Established Church of England and her bishops. I shouldbe very sorry that my heir should go among them."With reference to my stopping the income which I have hitherto allowedyou, it was a step I took upon the best advice, nor can I allow it to bethought that there is any legal claim upon me for a continuance of thepayment. But I am willing for the present to continue it, on the fullunderstanding that you at once give up your American project."But there is a subject on which it is essentially necessary that Ishould receive from you, as my heir, a full and complete explanation.Under what circumstances did you beat Captain Scarborough in the streetslate on the night of the 3d of June last? And how did it come to passthat you left him bleeding, speechless, and motionless on that occasion?"As I am about to continue the payment of the sum hitherto allowed, Ithink it only fitting that I should receive this explanation under yourown hand.--I am your affectionate uncle,"PETER PROSPER."P.S.--A rumor may probably have reached you of a projected alliancebetween me and a young lady belonging to a family with which your sisteris about to connect herself. It is right that I should tell you thatthere is no truth in this report."This letter, which was much easier to write than the one intended forMiss Thoroughbung, was unfortunately sent off a little before thecompletion of the other. A day's interval had been intended. But themissive to Miss Thoroughbung was, under the press of difficulties,delayed longer than was intended.There was, we grieve to say, much of joy but more of laughter at therectory when this letter was received. As usual, Joe Thoroughbung wasthere, and it was found impossible to keep the letter from him. Thepostscript burst upon them all as a surprise, and was welcomed by no onewith more vociferous joy than by the lady's nephew. "So there is an endforever to the hope that a child of the Buntingford Brewery should situpon the throne of the Prospers." It was thus that Joe expressedhimself."Why shouldn't he have sat there?" said Polly. "A Thoroughbung is asgood as a Prosper any day." But this was not said in the presence ofMrs. Annesley, who on that subject entertained views very different fromher daughter."I wonder what his idea is of the Church of England?" said Mr.Annesley. "Does he think that the Archbishop of Canterbury is supreme inall religious matters in America?""How on earth he knows that the women are all vulgar, when he has neverseen one of them, is a mystery," said Harry."And that they are dishonest in all their dealings," said Joe. "Isuppose he got that out of some of the radical news papers." For Joe,after the manner of brewers, was a staunch Tory."And their President, too, is vulgar as well as the ladies," said Mr.Annesley. "And this is the opinion of an educated Englishman, who is notashamed to own that he entertains serious antipathies against a wholenation!"But at the parsonage they soon returned to a more serious considerationof the matter. Did Uncle Prosper intend to forgive the sinneraltogether? And was he coerced into doing so by a conviction that he hadbeen told lies, or by the uncommon difficulties which presentedthemselves to him in reference to another heir? At any rate, it wasagreed by them all that Harry must meet his uncle half-way, and writethe "full and complete explanation," as desired. "'Bleeding, speechless,and motionless!'" said Harry. "I can't deny that he was bleeding; hecertainly was speechless, and for a few moments may have beenmotionless. What am I to say?" But the letter was not a difficult one towrite, and was sent across on the same day to the Hall. There Mr.Prosper gave up a day to its consideration,--a day which would have beenmuch better devoted to applying the final touch to his own letter toMiss Thoroughbung. And he found at last that his nephew's letterrequired no rejoinder.But Harry had much to do. It was first necessary that he should see hisfriend, and explain to him that causes over which he had no controlforbade him to go to America. "Of course, you know, I can't fly in myuncle's face. I was going because he intended to disinherit me; but hefinds that more troublesome than letting me alone, and therefore I mustremain. You see what he says about the Americans." The gentleman, whoseopinion about our friends on the other side of the Atlantic was verydifferent from Mr. Prosper's, fell into a long argument on the subject.But he was obliged at last to give up his companion.Then came the necessity of explaining the change in all his plans toFlorence Mountjoy, and with this view he wrote the short letter given atthe beginning of the chapter, following it down in person toCheltenham. "Mamma, Harry is here," said Florence to her mother."Well, my dear? I did not bring him.""But what am I to say to him?""How can I tell? Why do you ask me?""Of course he must come and see me," said Florence. "He has sent a noteto say that he will be here in ten minutes.""Oh dear! oh dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Mountjoy."Do you mean to be present, mamma? That is what I want to know." Butthat was the question which at the moment Mrs. Mountjoy could notanswer. She had pledged herself not to be unkind, on condition that nomarriage should take place for three years. But she could not begin bybeing kind, as otherwise she would immediately have been pressed toabandon that very condition. "Perhaps, mamma, it would be less painfulif you would not see him.""But he is not to make repeated visits.""No, not at present; I think not.""He must come only once," said Mrs. Mountjoy, firmly. "He was to havecome because he was going to America. But now he has changed all hisplans. It isn't fair, Florence.""What can I do? I cannot send him to America because you thought he wasto go there. I thought so too; and so did he. I don't know what haschanged him; but it wasn't likely that he'd write and say he wouldn'tcome because he had altered his plans. Of course he wants to see me; andso do I want to see him--very much. Here he is!"There was a ring at the bell, and Mrs. Mountjoy was driven to resolvewhat she would do at the moment. "You mustn't be above a quarter of anhour. I won't have you together for above a quarter of an hour,--ortwenty minutes at the farthest." So saying, Mrs. Mountjoy escaped fromthe room, and within a minute or two Florence found herself in HarryAnnesley's arms.The twenty minutes had become forty before Harry had thought ofstirring, although he had been admonished fully a dozen times that hemust at that moment take his departure. Then the maid knocked at thedoor, and brought word "that missus wanted to see Miss Florence in herbedroom.""Now, Harry, you must go. You really shall go,--or I will. I am very,very happy to hear what you have told me.""But three years!""Unless mamma will agree.""It is quite out of the question. I never heard of anything so absurd.""Then you must get mamma to consent. I have promised her for threeyears, and you ought to know that I will keep my word. Harry, I alwayskeep my word; do I not? If she will consent, I will. Now, sir, I reallymust go." Then there was a little form of farewell which need not beespecially explained, and Florence went up stairs to her mother.CHAPTER XLIX.CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES GETS HIS MONEY.When we last left Captain Scarborough, he had just lost an additionalsum of two hundred and twenty-seven pounds to Captain Vignolles, whichhe was not able to pay, besides the sum of fifty pounds which he hadreceived the day before, as the first instalment of his new allowance.This was but a bad beginning of the new life he was expected to leadunder the renewed fortunes which his father was preparing for him. Hehad given his promissory note for the money at a week's date, and hadbeen extremely angry with Captain Vignolles because that gentleman had,under the circumstances, been a little anxious about it. It certainlywas not singular that he should have been so, as Captain Scarborough hadbeen turned out of more than one club in consequence of his inability topay his card debts. As he went home to his lodgings, with CaptainVignolles's champagne in his head, he felt very much as he had done thatnight when he attacked Harry Annesley. But he met no one whom he couldconsider as an enemy, and therefore got himself to bed, and slept offthe fumes of the drink.On that day he was to return to Tretton; but, when he awoke, he feltthat before he did so he must endeavor to make some arrangements forpaying the amount due at the end of the week. He had already borrowedtwenty pounds from Mr. Grey, and had intended to repay him out of thesum which his father had given him; but that sum now was gone, and hewas again nearly penniless. In this emergency there was nothing left tohim but again to go to Mr. Grey.As he was shown up the stairs to the lawyer's room he did feelthoroughly ashamed of himself. Mr. Grey knew all the circumstances ofhis career, and it would be necessary now to tell him of this lastadventure. He did tell himself, as he dragged himself up the stairs,that for such a one as he was there could be no redemption. "It would bebetter that I should go back," he said, "and throw myself from theMonument." But yet he felt that if Florence Mountjoy could still be his,there might yet be a hope that things would go well with him.Mr. Grey began by expressing surprise at seeing Captain Scarborough intown. "Oh yes, I have come up. It does not matter why, because, asusual, I have put my foot in it. It was at my father's bidding; but thatdoes not matter.""How have you put your foot in it?" said the attorney. There was one wayin which the captain was always "putting" both his "feet in it;" but,since he had been turned out of his clubs, Mr. Grey did not think thatthat way was open to him."The old story.""Do you mean that you have been gambling again?""Yes;--I met a friend last night and he asked me to his rooms.""And he had the cards ready?""Of course he had. What else would any one have ready for me?""And he won that remnant of the twenty pounds which you borrowed fromme, and therefore you want another?" Hereupon the captain shook hishead. "What is it, then, that you do want?""Such a man as I met," said the captain, "would not be content with theremnant of twenty pounds. I had received fifty from my father, and hadintended to call here and pay you.""That has all gone too?""Yes, indeed. And in addition to that I have given him a note for twohundred and twenty-seven pounds, which I must take up in a week's time.Otherwise I must disappear again,--and this time forever.""It is a bottomless gulf," said the attorney. Captain Scarborough satsilent, with something almost approaching to a smile on his mouth; buthis heart within him certainly was not smiling. "A bottomless gulf,"repeated the attorney. Upon this the captain frowned. "What is it thatyou wish me to do for you? I have no money of your father's in my hands,nor could I give it you if I had it.""I suppose not. I must go back to him, and tell him that it is so."Then it was the lawyer's turn to be silent; and he remained thinking ofit all till Captain Scarborough rose from his seat and prepared to go."I won't trouble you any more Mr. Grey," he said."Sit down," said Mr. Grey. But the captain still remained standing. "Sitdown. Of course I can take out my check-book, and write a check for thissum of money;--nothing would be so easy; and if I could succeed inexplaining it to your father during his lifetime, he, no doubt, wouldrepay me. And, for the sake of auld lang syne, I should not be unhappyabout my money, whether he did so or not. But would it be wise? On yourown account would it be wise?""I cannot say that anything done for me would be wise,--unless you couldcut my throat.""And yet there is no one whose future life might be easier. Your father,the circumstances of whose life are the most singular I ever knew--""I shall never believe all this about my mother.""Never mind that now. We will pass that by for the present. He hasdisinherited you.""That will be a question some day for the lawyers--should I live.""But circumstances have so gone with him that he is enabled to leave youanother fortune. He is very angry with your brother, in which anger Isympathize. He will strip Tretton as bare as the palm of my hand foryour sake. You have always been his favorite, and so, in spite of allthings, you are still. They tell me he cannot last for six monthslonger.""Heaven knows I do not wish him to die.""But he thinks that your brother does. He feels that Augustus begrudgeshim a few months' longer life, and he is angry. If he could again makeyou his heir, now that the debts are all paid, he would do so." Here thecaptain shook his head. "But as it is, he will leave you enough for allthe needs of even a luxurious life. Here is his will, which I am goingto send down to him for final execution this very day. My senior clerkwill take it, and you will meet him there. That will give you ample forlife. But what is the use of it all, if you can lose it in one night orin one month among a pack of scoundrels?""If they be scoundrels, I am one of them.""You lose your money. You are their dupe. To the best of my belief youhave never won. The dupes lose, and the scoundrels win. It must be so.""You know nothing about it, Mr. Grey.""This man who had your money last;--does he not live on it as aprofession? Why should he win always, and you lose?""It is my luck.""Luck! There is no such thing as luck. Toss up, right hand against leftfor an hour together, and the result will be the same. If not for anhour, then do it for six hours. Take the average, and your cards will bethe same as another man's.""Another man has his skill," said Mountjoy."And uses it against the unskillful to earn his daily bread. That is thesame as cheating. But what is the use of all this? You must have thoughtof it all before.""Yes, indeed.""And thinking of it, you are determined to persevere. You are impetuous,not thoughtless, with your brain clouded with drink, and for the mereexcitement of the thing, you are determined to risk all in a contest forwhich there is no chance for you,--and by which you acknowledge you willbe driven to self-destruction, as the only natural end.""I fear it is so," said the captain."How much shall I draw it for?" said the attorney, taking out hischeck-book,--"and to whom shall I make it payable? I suppose I may dateit to-day, so that the swindler who gets it may think that there isplenty more behind for him to get.""Do you mean that you are going to lend it me?""Oh, yes.""And how do you mean to get it again?""I must wait, I suppose, till you have won it back among your friends.If you will tell me that you do not intend to look for it in thatfashion, then I shall have no doubt as to your making me a legitimatepayment in a very short time. Two hundred and twenty pounds won't ruinyou, unless you are determined to ruin yourself." Mr. Grey the meanwhilewent on writing the check. "Here is provided for you a large sum ofmoney," and he laid his hand upon the will, "out of which you will beable to pay me without the slightest difficulty. It is for you to saywhether you will or not.""I will.""You need not say it in that fashion;--that's easy. You must say it atsome moment when the itch of play is on you; when there shall be no oneby to hear: when the resolution if held, shall have some meaning in it.Then say, 'there's that money which I had from old Grey. I am bound topay it. But if I go in there I know what will be the result. The verycoin that should go into his coffers will become a part of the prey onwhich those harpies will feed.' There's the check for the two hundredand twenty-seven pounds. I have drawn it exact, so that you may send theidentical bit of paper to your friend. He will suppose that I am somemoney-lender who has engaged to supply your needs while your recoveredfortune lasts. Tell your father he shall have the will to-morrow. Idon't suppose I can send Smith with it to-day."Then it became necessary that Scarborough should go; but it would bebecoming that he should first utter some words of thanks. "I think youwill get it back, Mr. Grey.""I dare say.""I think you will. It may be that the having to pay you will keep me fora while from the gambling-table.""You don't look for more than that?""I am an unfortunate man, Mr. Grey. There is one thing that would cureme, but that one thing is beyond my reach.""Some woman?""Well;--it is a woman. I think I could keep my money for the sake of hercomfort. But never mind. Good-bye, Mr. Grey. I think I shall rememberwhat you have done for me." Then he went and sent the identical check toCaptain Vignolles, with the shortest and most uncourteous epistle:"DEAR SIR,--I send you your money. Send back the note."Yours. M. SCARBOROUGH.""I hardly expected this," said the captain to himself as he pocketed thecheck,--"at any rate not so soon. 'Nothing venture, nothing have.' ThatMoody is a slow coach, and will never do anything. I thought there'd bea little money about with him for a time." Then the captain turned overin his mind that night's good work with the self-satisfied air of anindustrious professional worker.But Mr. Grey was not so well satisfied with himself, and determined fora while to say nothing to Dolly of the two hundred and twenty-sevenpounds which he had undoubtedly risked by the loan. But his mind misgavehim before he went to sleep, and he felt that he could not becomfortable till he had made a clean breast of it. During the eveningDolly had been talking to him of all the troubles of all theCarrolls,--how Amelia would hardly speak to her father or her motherbecause of her injured lover, and was absolutely insolent to her, Dolly,whenever they met; how Sophia had declared that promises ought to bekept, and that Amelia should be got rid of; and how Mrs. Carroll hadtold her in confidence that Carroll _pere_ had come home the nightbefore drunker than usual, and had behaved most abominably. But Mr. Greyhad attended very little to all this, having his mind preoccupied withthe secret of the money which he had lent.Therefore Dolly did not put out her candle, and arrayed herself for bedin the costume with which she was wont to make her nocturnal visits. Shehad perceived that her father had something on his mind which it wouldbe necessary that he should tell. She was soon summoned, and havingseated herself on the bed, began the conversation: "I knew you wouldwant me to-night.""Why so?""Because you've got something to tell. It's about Mr. Barry.""No indeed.""That's well. Just at this moment I seem to care about Mr. Barry morethan any other trouble. But I fear that he has forgotten mealtogether,--which is not complimentary.""Mr. Barry will turn up all in proper time," said her father. "I havegot nothing to say about Mr. Barry just at present, so if you arelove-lorn you had better go to bed.""Very well. When I am love-lorn I will. Now, what have you got to tellme?""I have lent a man a large sum of money,--two hundred and twenty-sevenpounds!""You are always lending people large sums of money.""I generally get it back again.""From Mr. Carroll, for instance,--when he borrows it for a pair ofbreeches and spends it in gin-and-water.""I never lent him a shilling. He is a burr, and has to be pacified, notby loans but gifts. It is too late now for me to prevent thebrother-in-lawship of poor Carroll.""Who has got this money?""A professed gambler, who never wins anything, and constantly loses morethan he is able to pay. Yet I do think this man will pay me some day.""It is Captain Scarborough," said Dolly. "Seeing that his father is avery rich man indeed, and as far as I can understand gives you a greatdeal more trouble than he is worth, I don't see why you should lend alarge sum of money to his son.""Simply because he wanted it.""Oh dear! oh dear!""He wanted it very much. He had gone away a ruined man because of hisgambling; and now, when he had come back and was to be put upon his legsagain, I could not see him again ruined for the need of such a sum. Itwas very foolish.""Perhaps a little rash, papa.""But now I have told you; and so there may be an end of it. But I'lltell you what, Dolly: I'll bet you a new straw hat he pays me within amonth of his father's death." Then Dolly was allowed to escape andbetake herself to her bed.On that same day Mountjoy Scarborough went down to Tretton, and was atonce closeted with his father. Mr. Scarborough had questions to askabout Mr. Prosper, and was anxious to know how his son had succeeded inhis mission. But the conversation was soon turned from Mr. Prosper toCaptain Vignolles and Mr. Grey. Mountjoy had determined, as soon as hehad got the check from Mr. Grey, to say nothing about it to his father.He had told Mr. Grey in order that he need not tell his father,--if themoney were forthcoming. But he had not been five minutes in his father'sroom before he rushed to the subject. "You got among those birds of preyagain?" said his father."There was only one bird,--or at least two. A big bird and a small one.""And you lost how much?" Then the captain told the precise sum. "AndGrey has lent it you?" The captain nodded his head. "Then you must rideinto Tretton and catch the mail to-night with a check to repay him. Thatyou should have been able in so short a time to have found a man willingto fleece you! I suppose it's hopeless?""I cannot tell.""Altogether hopeless.""What am I to say, sir? If I make a promise it will go for nothing.""For absolutely nothing.""Then what would be the use of my promising?""You are quite logical, and look upon the matter in altogether a properlight. As you have ruined yourself so often, and done your best to ruinthose that belong to you, what hope can there be? About this money thatI have left you, I do not know that anything farther can be said,--unlessI leave it all to an hospital. It is better that you should have it andthrow it away among the gamblers, than that it should fall into thehands of Augustus. Besides, the demand is moderate. No doubt it is onlya beginning, but we will see."Then he got out his check-book, and made Mountjoy himself write thecheck, including the two sums which had been borrowed. And he dictatedthe letter to Mr. Grey:"MY DEAR GREY,--I return the money which Mountjoy has had from you,--twohundred and twenty-seven pounds, and twenty. That, I think, is right.You are the most foolish man I know with your money. To have given it tosuch a scapegrace as my son Mountjoy! But you are the sweetest andfinest gentleman I ever came across. You have got your money now, whichis a great deal more than you can have expected or ought to haveobtained. However, on this occasion you have been in great luck."Yours faithfully,"JOHN SCARBOROUGH."This letter his son himself was forced to write, though it dealtaltogether with his own delinquencies; and yet, as he told himself, hewas not sorry to write it, as it would declare to Mr. Grey that he hadhimself acknowledged at once his own sin. The only farther punishmentwhich his father exacted was that his son should himself ride intoTretton and post the letter before he ate his dinner."I've got my money," said Mr. Grey, waving the check as he went into hisdressing-room, with Dolly at his heels."Who has paid it?""Old Scarborough; and he made Mountjoy write the letter himself, callingme an old fool for lending it. I don't think I was such a fool at all.However, I've got my money, and you may pay the bet and not say anythingmore about it."CHAPTER L.THE LAST OF MISS THOROUGHBUNG.Mr. Prosper, with that kind of energy which was distinctively his own,had sent off his letter to Harry Annesley, with his postscript in itabout his blighted matrimonial prospects,--a letter easy to bewritten,--before he had completed his grand epistle to Miss Thoroughbung.The epistle to Miss Thoroughbung was one requiring great consideration.It had to be studied in every word, and re-written again and again withthe profoundest care. He was afraid that he might commit himself by anepithet. He dreaded even an adverb too much. He found that a full stopexpressed his feelings too violently, and wrote the letter again, forthe fifth time, because of the big initial which followed the full stop.The consequence of all this long delay was, that Miss Thoroughbung hadheard the news, through the brewery, before it reached her in itslegitimate course. Mr. Prosper had written his postscript by accident,and, in writing it, had forgotten the intercourse between hisbrother-in-law's house and the Buntingford people. He had known well ofthe proposed marriage; but he was a man who could not think of twothings at the same time, and thus had committed the blunder.Perhaps it was better for him as it was; and the blow came to him with arapidity which created less of suffering than might have followed theslower mode of proceeding which he had intended. He was actually makingthe fifth copy of the letter, rendered necessary by that violent fullstop, when Matthew came to him and announced that Miss Thoroughbung wasin the drawing-room. "In the house!" ejaculated Mr. Prosper."She would come into the hall; and then where was I to put her?""Matthew Pike, you will not do for my service." This had been said aboutonce every three months throughout the long course of years in whichMatthew had lived with his master."Very well, sir. I am to take it for a month's warning, of course."Matthew understood well enough that this was merely an expression of hismaster's displeasure, and, being anxious for his master's welfare, knewthat it was decorous that some decision should be come to at once as toMiss Thoroughbung, and that time should not be lost in his own littlepersonal quarrel. "She is waiting, you know, sir, and she looks uncommonirascible. There is the other lady left outside in the carriage.""Miss Tickle! Don't let her in, whatever you do. She is the worst. Ohdear! oh dear! Where are my coat and waistcoat, and my braces? And Ihaven't brushed my hair. And these slippers won't do. What business hasshe to come at this time of day, without saying a word to anybody?" ThenMatthew went to work, and got his master into decent apparel, with aslittle delay as possible. "After all," said Mr. Prosper, "I don't thinkI'll see her. Why should I see her?""She knows you are at home, sir.""Why does she know I'm at home? That's your fault. She oughtn't to knowanything about it. Oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!" These last ejaculationsarose from his having just then remembered the nature of his postscriptto Harry Annesley, and the engagement of Joe Thoroughbung to his niece.He made up his mind at the moment,--or thought that he had made up hismind,--that Harry Annesley should not have a shilling as long as helived. "I am quite out of breath. I cannot see her yet. Go and offer thelady cake and wine, and tell her that you had found me very muchindisposed. I think you will have to tell her that I am not well enoughto receive her to-day.""Get it over, sir, and have done with it.""It's all very well to say have done with it. I shall never have donewith it. Because you have let her in to-day she'll think that she cancome always. Good Lord! There she is on the stairs! Pick up myslippers." Then the door was opened, and Miss Thoroughbung herselfentered the room. It was an up-stairs chamber, known as Mr. Prosper'sown: and from it was the door into his bedroom. How Miss Thoroughbunghad learned her way to it he never could guess. But she had come up thestairs as though she had been acquainted with all the intricacies of thehouse from her childhood."Mr. Prosper," she said, "I hope I see you quite well this morning, andthat I have not disturbed you at your toilet." That she had done so wasevident, from the fact that Matthew, with the dressing-gown andslippers, was seen disappearing into the bedroom."I am not very well, thank you," said Mr. Prosper, rising from hischair, and offering her his hand with the coldest possible salutation."I am sorry for that,--very. I hope it is not your indisposition whichhas prevented you from coming to see me. I have been expecting you everyday since Soames wrote his last letter. But it's no use pretending anylonger. Oh, Peter, Peter!" This use of his Christian name struck himabsolutely dumb, so that he was unable to utter a syllable. He should,first of all, have told her that any excuse she had before for callinghim by his Christian name was now at an end. But there was no openingfor speech such as that. "Well," she continued, "have you got nothing tosay to me? You can write flippant letters to other people, and turn meinto ridicule glibly enough.""I have never done so.""Did you not write to Joe Thoroughbung, and tell him you had given upall thoughts of having me?""Joe!" he exclaimed. His very surprise did not permit him to go farther,at the moment, than this utterance of the young man's Christian name."Yes, Joe,--Joe Thoroughbung, my nephew, and yours that is to be. Did younot write and tell him that everything was over?""I never wrote to young Mr. Thoroughbung in my life. I should not havedreamed of such a correspondence on such a subject.""Well, he says you did. Or, if you didn't write to Joe himself, youwrote to somebody.""I may have written to somebody, certainly.""And told them that you didn't mean to have anything farther to say tome?" That traitor Harry had now committed a sin worse that knocking aman down in the middle of the night and leaving him bleeding,speechless, and motionless; worse than telling a lie about it;--worseeven than declining to listen to sermons read by his uncle. Harry hadcommitted such a sin that no shilling of allowance should evermore bepaid to him. Even at this moment there went through Mr. Prosper's brainan idea that there might be some unmarried female in England besidesMiss Puffle and Miss Thoroughbung. "Peter Prosper, why don't you answerlike a man, and tell me the honest truth?" He had never before beencalled Peter Prosper in his whole life."Perhaps you had better let me make a communication by letter," he said.At that very moment the all but completed epistle was lying on the tablebefore him, where even her eyes might reach it. In the flurry of themoment he covered it up."Perhaps that is the letter which has taken you so long to write?" shesaid."It is the letter.""Then hand it me over, and save yourself the penny stamp." In hisconfusion he gave her the letter, and threw himself down on the sofawhile she read it. "You have been very careful in choosing yourlanguage, Mr. Prosper: 'It will be expedient that I should make known toyou the entire truth.' Certainly, Mr. Prosper, certainly. The entiretruth is the best thing,--next to entire beer, my brother would say.""The horrid vulgar woman!" Mr. Prosper ejaculated to himself. "'Thereseems to have been a complete misunderstanding with regard to thatamiable lady, Miss Tickle.' No misunderstanding at all. You said youliked her, and I supposed you did. And when I had been living for twentyyears with a female companion, who hasn't sixpence in the world to buy arag with but what she gets from me, was it to be expected that I shouldturn her out for any man?""An annuity might have been arranged, Miss Thoroughbung.""Bother an annuity! That's all you think about feelings! Was she to goand live alone and desolate because you wanted some one to nurse you?And then those wretched ponies. I tell you, Peter Prosper, that let memarry whom I will, I mean to drive a pair of ponies, and am able to doso out of my own money. Ponies, indeed! It's an excuse. Your heart hasfailed you. You've come to know a woman of spirit, and now you areafraid that she'll be too much for you. I shall keep this letter, thoughit has not been sent.""You can do as you please about that, Miss Thoroughbung.""Oh yes; of course I shall keep it, and shall give it to Messrs. Soames& Simpson. They are most gentlemanlike men, and will be shocked at suchconduct as this from the Squire of Buston. The letter will be publishedin the newspapers, of course. It will be very painful to me, no doubt,but I shall owe it to my sex to punish you. When all the county aretalking of your conduct to a lady, and saying that no man could havedone it, let alone no gentleman, then you will feel it. Miss Tickle,--anda pair of ponies! You expected to get my money and nothing to give forit. Oh, you mean man!"She must have been aware that every word she spoke was a dagger. Therewas a careful analysis of his peculiar character displayed in every wordof reproach which she uttered. Nothing could have wounded him more thanthe comparison between himself and Soames & Simpson. They weregentlemen! "The vulgarest men in all Buntingford!" he declared tohimself, and always ready for any sharp practice. Whereas he was no man,Miss Thoroughbung said,--a mean creature, altogether unworthy to beregarded as a gentleman. He knew himself to be Mr. Prosper of BustonHall, with centuries of Prospers for his ancestors; whereas Soames wasthe son of a tax-gatherer, and Simpson had come down from London as aclerk from a solicitor's office in the City. And yet it was true thatpeople would talk of him as did Miss Thoroughbung! His cruelty would bein every lady's mouth. And then his stinginess about the ponies would bethe gossip of the county for twelve months. And, as he found out whatMiss Thoroughbung was, the disgrace of even having wished to marry herloomed terribly large before him.But there was a twinkle of jest in the lady's eyes all the while whichhe did not perceive, and which, had he perceived it, he could not haveunderstood. Her anger was but simulated wrath. She, too, had thoughtthat it might be well, under circumstances, if she were to marry Mr.Prosper, but had quite understood that those circumstances might not beforthcoming. "I don't think it will do at all, my dear," she had said toMiss Tickle. "Of course an old bachelor like that won't want to haveyou.""I beg you won't think of me for a moment," Miss Tickle had answered,with solemnity."Bother! why can't you tell the truth? I'm not going to throw you over,and of course you'd be just nowhere if I did. I shan't break my heartfor Mr. Prosper. I know I should be an old fool if I were to marry him;and he is more of an old fool for wanting to marry me. But I did thinkhe wouldn't cut up so rough about the ponies." And then, when no answercame to the last letter from Soames & Simpson, and the tidings reachedher, round from the brewery, that Mr. Prosper intended to be off, shewas not in the least surprised. But the information, she thought, hadcome to her in an unworthy manner. So she determined to punish thegentleman, and went out to Buston Hall and called him Peter Prosper. Wemay doubt, however, whether she had ever realized how terribly herscourges would wale him."And to think that you would let it come round to me in that way,through the young people,--writing about it just as a joke!""I never wrote about it like a joke," said Mr. Prosper, almost crying."I remember now. It was to your nephew; and of course everybody at therectory saw it. Of course they were all laughing at you." There was onething now written in the book of fate, and sealed as certainly as thecrack of doom: no shilling of allowance should ever be paid to HarryAnnesley. He would go abroad. He said so to himself as he thought ofthis, and said also that, if he could find a healthy young womananywhere, he would marry her, sacrificing every idea of his ownhappiness to his desire of revenge upon his nephew. This, however, wasonly the passionate feeling of the moment. Matrimony had becomealtogether so distasteful to him, since he had become intimatelyacquainted with Miss Thoroughbung, as to make any release in that mannerquite impossible to him. "Do you propose to make me any amends?" askedMiss Thoroughbung."Money?" said he."Yes; money. Why shouldn't you pay me money? I should like to keep threeponies, and to have Miss Tickle's sister to come and live with me.""I do not know whether you are in earnest, Miss Thoroughbung.""Quite in earnest, Peter Prosper. But perhaps I had better leave thatmatter in the hands of Soames & Simpson,--very gentleman-like men,--andthey'll be sure to let you know how much you ought to pay. Ten thousandpounds wouldn't be too much, considering the distress to my woundedfeelings." Here Miss Thoroughbung put her handkerchief up to her eyes.There was nothing that he could say. Whether she were laughing at him,as he thought to be most probable, or whether there was some grain oftruth in the demand which she made, he found it equally impossible tomake any reply. There was nothing that he could say; nor could heabsolutely turn her out of the room. But after ten minutes' farthercontinuation of these amenities, during which it did at last come hometo his brain that she was merely laughing at him, he began to think thathe might possibly escape, and leave her there in possession of hischamber."If you will excuse me, Miss Thoroughbung, I will retire," he said,rising from the sofa."Regularly chaffed out of your own den!" she said, laughing."I do not like this interchange of wit on subjects that are so serious.""Interchange! There is very little interchange, according to my idea.You haven't said anything witty. What an idea of interchange the manhas!""At any rate I will escape from your rudeness.""Now, Peter Prosper, before you go let me ask you one question. Which ofthe two has been the rudest to the other? You have come and asked me tomarry you, and have evidently wished to back out of it from the momentin which you found that I had ideas of my own about money. And now youcall me rude, because I have my little revenge. I have called you PeterProsper, and you can't stand it. You haven't spirit enough to call meMatty Thoroughbung in reply. But good-bye, Mr. Prosper,--for I never willcall you Peter again. As to what I said to you about money, that, ofcourse, is all bosh. I'll pay Soames's bill, and will never trouble you.There's your letter, which, however, would be of no use, because it isnot signed. A very stupid letter it is. If you want to write naturallyyou should never copy a letter. Good-bye, Mr. Prosper--Peter that nevershall be." Then she got up and walked out of the room.Mr. Prosper, when he was left alone, remained for a while nearlyparalyzed. That he should have ever entertained the idea of making thatwoman his wife! Such was his first thought. Then he reflected that hehad, in truth, escaped from her more easily than he had hoped, and thatshe had certainly displayed some good qualities in spite of hervulgarity and impudence. She did not, at any rate, intend to trouble himany farther. He would never again hear himself called Peter by thatterribly loud voice. But his anger became very fierce against the wholefamily at the rectory. They had ventured to laugh at him, and he couldunderstand that, in their eyes, he had become very ridiculous.He could see it all,--the manner in which they had made fun of him, andhad been jocose over his intended marriage. He certainly had notintended to be funny in their eyes. But, while he had been exercisingthe duty of a stern master over them, and had been aware of his ownextreme generosity in his efforts to forgive his nephew, that verynephew had been laughing at him, in conjunction with the nephew of herwhom he had intended to make his wife! Not a shilling, again, shouldever be allowed to Harry Annesley. If it could be so arranged, by anychange of circumstances, he might even yet become the father of a familyof his own.CHAPTER LI.MR. PROSPER IS TAKEN ILL.When Harry Annesley returned from Cheltenham, which he did about thebeginning of February, he was a very happy man. It may be said, indeed,that within his own heart he was more exalted than is fitting for a manmortal,--for a human creature who may be cut off from his joys to-morrow,or may have the very source of his joy turned into sorrow. He walkedlike a god, not showing it by his outward gesture, not declaring that itwas so by any assumed grace or arrogant carriage of himself; but knowingwithin himself that that had happened down at Cheltenham which had allbut divested him of humanity, and made a star of him. To no one else hadit been given to have such feelings, such an assurance of heavenlybliss, together with the certainty that, under any circumstances, itmust be altogether his own, for ever and ever. It was thus he thought ofhimself and what had happened to him. He had succeeded in gettinghimself kissed by a young woman.Harry Annesley was in truth very proud of Florence, and altogetherbelieved in her. He thought the better of himself because Florence lovedhim,--not with the vulgar self-applause of a man who fancies himself tobe a lady-killer and therefore a grand sort of fellow, but in conceivinghimself to be something better than he had hitherto believed, simplybecause he had won the heart of this one special girl. During thathalf-hour at Cheltenham she had so talked to him, and managed in her ownpretty way so to express herself, as to make him understand that of allthat there was of her he was the only lord and master. "May God do so tome, and more also, if to the end I do not treat her not only with allaffection, but also with all delicacy of observance." It was thus thathe spoke to himself of her, as he walked away from the door of Mrs.Mountjoy's house in Cheltenham.From thence he went back to Buston, and entered his father's house withall that halo of happiness shining round his heart. He did not say muchabout it, but his mother and his sisters felt that he was altered; andhe understood their feelings when his mother said to him, after a day ortwo, that "it was a great shame" that they none of them knew hisFlorence."But you will have to know her--well.""That's of course; but it's a thousand pities that we should not be ableto talk of her to you as one whom we know already." Then he felt thatthey had, among them all, acknowledged her to be such as she was.There came to the rectory some tidings of the meeting which had takenplace at the Hall between his uncle and Miss Thoroughbung. It was Joewho brought to them the first account; and then farther particularsleaked out among the servants of the two houses. Matthew was verydiscreet; but even Matthew must have spoken a word or two. In the firstplace there came the news that Mr. Prosper's anger against his nephewwas hotter than ever. "Mr. Harry must have put his foot in it somehow."That had been Matthew's assurance, made with much sorrow to thehouse-keeper, or head-servant, at the rectory. And then Joe had declaredthat all the misfortunes which had attended Mr. Prosper's courtship hadbeen attributed to Harry's evil influences. At first this could not butbe a matter of joke. Joe's stories as he told them were full ofridicule, and had no doubt come to him from Miss Thoroughbung, eitherdirectly or through some of the ladies at Buntingford. "It does seemthat your aunt has been too many for him." This had been said by Molly,and had been uttered in the presence both of Joe Thoroughbung and ofHarry."Why, yes," said Joe. "She has had him under the thong altogether, andhas not found it difficult to flog him when she had got him by the hindleg." This idea had occurred to Joe from his remembrance of a peccanthound in the grasp of a tyrant whip. "It seems that he offered hermoney.""I should hardly think that," said Harry, standing up for his uncle."She says so; and says that she declared that ten thousand pounds wouldbe the very lowest sum. Of course she was laughing at him.""Uncle Prosper doesn't like to be laughed at," said Molly."And she did not spare him," said Joe. And then she had by heart thewhole story, how she had called him Peter, and how angry he had been atthe appellation."Nobody calls him Peter except my mother," said Harry."I should not dream of calling him Uncle Peter," said Molly. "Do youmean to say that Miss Thoroughbung called him Peter? Where could shehave got the courage?" To this Joe replied that he believed his aunt hadcourage for anything under the sun. "I don't think that she ought tohave called him Peter," continued Molly. "Of course after that therecouldn't be a marriage.""I don't quite see why not," said Joe. "I call you Molly, and I expectyou to marry me.""And I call you Joe, and I expect you to marry me; but we ain't quitethe same.""The Squire of Buston," said Joe, "considers himself Squire of Buston. Isuppose that the old Queen of Heaven didn't call Jupiter Jove tillthey'd been married at any rate some centuries.""Well done, Joe," said Harry."He'll become fellow of a college yet," said Molly."If you'll let me alone I will," said Joe. "But only conceive the kindof scene there must have been at the house up there when Aunt Matty hadforced her way in among your uncle's slippers and dressing-gowns. I'dhave given a five-pound note to have seen and heard it.""I'd have given two if it had never occurred. He had written me a letterwhich I had taken as a pardon in full for all my offences. He hadassured me that he had no intention of marrying, and had offered to giveme back my old allowance. Now I am told that he has quarrelled with meagain altogether, because of some light word as to me and my concernsspoken by this vivacious old aunt of yours. I wish your vivacious oldaunt had remained at Buntingford.""And we had wished that your vivacious old uncle had remained at Bustonwhen he came love-making to Marmaduke Lodge.""He was an old fool! and, among ourselves, always has been," said Molly,who on the occasion thought it incumbent upon her to take theThoroughbung rather than the Prosper side of the quarrel.But, in truth, this renewed quarrel between the Hall and the rectory waslikely to prove extremely deleterious to Harry Annesley's interests. Forhis welfare depended not solely on the fact that he was at present heirpresumptive to his uncle, nor yet on the small allowance of two hundredand fifty pounds made to him by his uncle, and capable of beingwithdrawn at any moment, but also on the fact, supposed to be known toall the world,--which was known to all the world before the affair in thestreets with Mountjoy Scarborough,--that Harry was his uncle's heir. Hisposition had been that of eldest son, and indeed that of only child to aman of acres and squire of a parish. He had been made to hope that thismight be restored to him, and at this moment absolutely had in hispocket the check for sixty-two pounds ten which had been sent to him byhis uncle's agent in payment of the quarter's income which had beenstopped. But he also had a farther letter, written on the next day,telling him that he was not to expect any repetition of the payment.Under these circumstances, what should he do?Two or three things occurred to him. But he resolved at last to keep thecheck without cashing it for some weeks, and then to write to his unclewhen the fury of his wrath might be supposed to have passed by, offeringto restore it. His uncle was undoubtedly a very silly man; but he wasnot one who could acknowledge to himself that he had done an unjust actwithout suffering for it. At the present moment, while his wrath washot, there would be no sense of contrition. His ears would still tinglewith the sound of the laughter of which he had supposed himself to havebeen the subject at the rectory. But that sound in a few weeks might dieaway, and some feeling of the propriety of justice would come back uponthe poor man's mind. Such was the state of things upon which Harryresolved to wait for a few weeks.But in the mean time tidings came across from the Hall that Mr. Prosperwas ill. He had remained in the house for two or three days after MissThoroughbung's visit. This had given rise to no special remarks, becauseit was well known that Mr. Prosper was a man whose feelings were oftentoo many for him. When he was annoyed it would be long before he wouldget the better of the annoyance; and during such periods he would remainsilent and alone. There could be no question that Miss Thoroughbung hadannoyed him most excessively. And Matthew had been aware that it wouldbe better that he should abstain from all questions. He would take thedaily newspaper in to his master, and ask for orders as to the dailydinner, and that would be all. Mr. Prosper, when in a fairly good humor,would see the cook every morning, and would discuss with her thepropriety of either roasting or boiling the fowl, and the expediencyeither of the pudding or the pie. His idiosyncrasies were well known,and the cook might always have her own way by recommending the contraryto that which she wanted,--because it was a point of honor with Mr.Prosper not to be led by his servants. But during these days he simplysaid, "Let me have dinner and do not trouble me." This went on for a dayor two without exciting much comment at the rectory. But when it went onbeyond a day or two it was surmised that Mr. Prosper was ill.At the end of a week he had not been seen outside the house, and thenalarm began to be felt. The rumor had got abroad that he intended to goto Italy, and it was expected that he would start, but no sign came ofhis intended movements; not a word more had been said to Matthew on thesubject. He had been ordered to admit no visitor into the house at all,unless it were some one from the firm of Grey & Barry. From the momentin which he had got rid of Miss Thoroughbung he had been subject to somedread lest she should return. Or if not she herself, she might, hethought, send Soames & Simpson, or some denizen from the brewery. And hewas conscious that not only all Buston, but all Buntingford was aware ofwhat he had attempted to do. Every one whom he chanced to meet would, ashe thought, be talking of him, and therefore he feared to be seen by theeye of man, woman, or child. There was a self-consciousness about himwhich altogether overpowered him. That cook with whom he used to havethe arguments about the boiled chicken was now an enemy, a domesticenemy, because he was sure that she talked about his projected marriagein the kitchen. He would not see his coachman or his groom, because sometidings would have reached them about that pair of ponies. Consequentlyhe shut himself up altogether, and the disease became worse with himbecause of his seclusion.And now from day to day, or, it may be more properly said, from hour tohour, news came across to the rectory of the poor squire's health.Matthew, to whom alone was given free intercourse with his master,became very gloomy. Mr. Prosper was no doubt gloomy, and the feeling wascontagious. "I think he's going off his head; that's what I do think,"he said, in confidential intercourse with the cook.That conversation resulted in Matthew's walking across to the rectory,and asking advice from the rector; and in the rector paying a visit tothe Hall. He had again consulted with his wife, and she had recommendedhim to endeavor to see her brother. "Of course, what we hear about hisanger only comes from Joe, or through the servants. If he is angry, whatwill it matter?""Not in the least to me," said the rector; "only I would not willinglytrouble him.""I would go," said the rector's wife, "only I know he would require meto agree with him about Harry. That, of course, I cannot do."Then the rector walked across to the Hall, and sent up word by Matthewthat he was there, and would be glad to see Mr. Prosper, if Mr. Prosperwere disengaged. But Matthew, after an interval of a quarter of an hour,came back with merely a note: "I am not very well, and an interview atthe present moment would only be depressing. But I would be glad to seemy sister, if she would come across to-morrow at twelve o'clock. I thinkit would be well that I should see some one, and she is now thenearest.--P.P." Then there arose a great discussion at the rectory as towhat this note indicated. "She is now the nearest!" He might have sowritten had the doctor who attended him told him that death wasimminent. Of course she was the nearest. What did the "now" mean? Was itnot intended to signify that Harry had been his heir, and therefore thenearest; but that now he had been repudiated? But it was of courseresolved that Mrs. Annesley should go to the Hall at the hour indicatedon the morrow."Oh yes; I'm up here; where else should I be,--unless you expected tofind me in my bed?" It was thus that he answered his sister's firstinquiry as to his condition."In bed? Oh no! Why should any one expect to find you in bed, Peter?""Never call me by that name again!" he said, rising up from his chair,and standing erect, with one arm stretched out. She called him Peter,simply because it had been her custom so to do during the period ofnearly fifty years in which they had lived in the same parish as brotherand sister. She could, therefore, only stare at him and his tragichumor, as he stood there before her. "Though of course it is madness onmy part to object to it! My godfather and godmother christened me Peter,and our father was Peter before me, and his father too was PeterProsper. But that woman has made the name sound abominable in my ears.""Miss Thoroughbung, you mean?""She came here, and so be-Petered me in my own house,--nay, up in thisvery room,--that I hardly knew whether I was on my head or my heels.""I would not mind what she said. They all know that she is a littleflighty.""Nobody told me so. Why couldn't you let me know that she was flightybeforehand? I thought that she was a person whom it would have done tomarry.""If you will only think of it, Peter--" Here he shuddered visibly. "Ibeg your pardon, I will not call you so again. But it is unreasonable toblame us for not telling you about Miss Thoroughbung.""Of course it is. I am unreasonable, I know it.""Let us hope that it is all over now.""Cart-ropes wouldn't drag me up to the hymeneal altar,--at least not withthat woman.""You have sent for me, Peter--I beg pardon. I was so glad when you sent.I would have come before, only I was afraid that you would be annoyed.Is there anything that we can do for you?""Nothing at all that you can do, I fear.""Somebody told us that you were thinking of going abroad." Here he shookhis head. "I think it was Harry." Here he shook his head and frowned."Had you not some idea of going abroad?""That is all gone," he said, solemnly."It would have enabled you to get over this disappointment withoutfeeling it so acutely.""I do feel it; but not exactly the disappointment. There I think I havebeen saved from a misfortune which would certainly have driven me mad.That woman's voice daily in my ear could have had no other effect. Ihave at any rate been saved from that.""What is it, then, that troubles you?""Everybody knows that I intended it. All the country has heard of it.But yet was not my purpose a good one? Why should not a gentleman marryif he wants to leave his estate to his own son?""Of course he must marry before he can do that.""Where was I to get a young lady--just outside of my own class? Therewas Miss Puffle. I did think of her. But just at the moment she went offwith young Tazlehurst. That was another misfortune. Why should MissPuffle have descended so low just before I had thought of her? And Icouldn't marry quite a young girl. How could I expect such a one to livehere with me at Buston, where it is rather dull? When I looked aboutthere was nobody except that horrid Miss Thoroughbung. You just lookabout and tell me if there was any one else. Of course my circle iscircumscribed. I have been very careful whom I have admitted to myintimacy, and the result is that I know almost nobody. I may say that Iwas driven to ask Miss Thoroughbung.""But why marry at all unless you're fond of somebody to be attached to?""Ah!""Why marry at all? I say. I ask the question knowing very well why youintended to do it.""Then why do you ask?" he said, angrily."Because it is so difficult to talk of Harry to you. Of course I cannothelp feeling that you have injured him.""It is he that has injured me. It is he that has brought me to thiscondition. Don't you know that you've all been laughing at me down atthe rectory since this affair of that terrible woman?" While he pausedfor an answer to his question Mrs. Annesley sat silent. "You know it istrue. He and that man whom Molly means to marry, and the other girls,and their father and you, have all been laughing at me.""I have never laughed.""But the others?" And again he waited for a reply. But the no replywhich came did as well as any other answer. There was the fact that hehad been ridiculed by the very young man whom it was intended that heshould support by his liberality. It was impossible to tell him that aman who had made himself so absurd must expect to be laughed at by hisjuniors. There was running through his mind an idea that very much wasdue to him from Harry; but there was also an idea that something too wasdue from him. There was present, even to him, a noble feeling that heshould bear all the ignominy with which he was treated, and still begenerous. But he had sworn to himself, and had sworn to Matthew, that hewould never forgive his nephew. "Of course you all wish me to be out ofthe way?""Why do you say that?""Because it is true. How happy you would all be if I were dead, andHarry were living here in my place.""Do you think so?""Yes, I do. Of course you would all go into mourning, and there would besome grimace of sorrow among you for a few weeks, but the sorrow wouldsoon be turned into joy. I shall not last long, and then his time willcome. There! you may tell him that his allowance shall be continued, inspite of all his laughing. It was for that purpose that I sent for you.And, now you know it, you can go and leave me." Then Mrs. Annesley didgo, and rejoiced them all up at the rectory by these latest tidings fromthe Hall. But now the feeling was, how could they show their gratitudeand kindness to poor Uncle Prosper?CHAPTER LII.MR. BARRY AGAIN."Mr. Barry has given me to understand that he means to come downto-morrow." This was said by Mr. Grey to his daughter."What does he want to come here for?""I suppose you know why he wants to come here?" Then the father wassilent, and for some time Dolly remained silent also. "He is coming toask you to consent to be his wife.""Why do you let him come, papa?""I cannot hinder him. That, in the first place. And then I don't want toprevent his coming.""Oh, papa!""I do not want to prevent his coming. And I do not wish you now at thisinstant to pledge yourself to anything.""I cannot but pledge myself.""You can at any rate remain silent while I speak to you." There was asolemnity in his manner which almost awed her, so that she could onlycome nearer to him and sit close to him, holding his hand in hers. "Iwish you to hear what I have got to say to you, and to make no answertill you shall make it to-morrow to him, after having fully consideredthe whole matter. In the first place, he is an honest and good man, andcertainly will not ill-treat you.""Is that so much?""It is a great deal, as men go. It would be a great deal to me to besure that I had left you in the hands of one who is, of his nature,tender and affectionate.""That is something; but not enough.""And then he is a careful man, who will certainly screen you from allwant; and he is prudent, walking about the world with his eyesopen,--much wider than your father has ever done." Here she only pressedhis hand. "There is nothing to be said against him, except thatsomething which you spotted at once when you said that he was not agentleman. According to your ideas, and to mine, he is not quite agentleman; but we are both fastidious.""We must pay the penalty of our tastes in that respect.""You are paying the penalty now by your present doubts. But it is notyet too late for you to get the better of it. Though I have acknowledgedthat he is not quite a gentleman, he is by no means the reverse. You arequite a lady.""I hope so.""But you are not particularly good-looking.""Papa, you are not complimentary.""My dear, I do not intend to be so. To me your face, such as it is, isthe sweetest thing on earth to look upon.""Oh, papa;--dear papa!" and she threw her arms round his neck and kissedhim."But having lived so long with me you have acquired my habits andthoughts, and have learned to disregard utterly your outwardappearance.""I would be decent and clean and womanly.""That is not enough to attract the eyes of men in general. But he hasseen deeper than most men do.""Into the value of the business, you mean?" said she."No, Dolly; I will not have that! that is ill-natured, and, as Ibelieve, altogether untrue. I think of Mr. Barry that he would not marryany girl for the sake of the business, unless he loved her.""That is nonsense, papa. How can Mr. Barry love me? Did he and I everhave five minutes of free conversation together?""Unless he meant to love, would be nearer the mark; and knew that hecould do so. You will be quite safe in his hands.""Safe, papa!""So much for yourself; and now I must say a few words as to myself. Youare not bound to marry him, or any one else, to do me a good turn; but Ithink you are bound to remember what my feelings would be if on mydeath-bed I were leaving you quite alone in the world. As far as moneyis concerned, you would have enough for all your wants; but that is allthat you would have. You have become so thoroughly my friend, that youhave hardly another real friend in the world.""That is my disposition.""Yes; but I must guard against the ill-effects of that disposition. Iknow that if some man came the way, whom you could in truth love, youwould make the sweetest wife that ever a man possessed.""Oh, papa, how you talk! No such man will come the way, and there's anend of it.""Mr. Barry has come the way,--and, as things go, is deserving of yourregard. My advice to you is to accept him. Now you will have twenty-fourhours to think of that advice, and to think of your own futurecondition. How will life go with you if you should be left living inthis house all alone?""Why do you speak as though we were to be parted to-morrow?""To-morrow or next day," he said very solemnly. "The day will surelycome before long. Mr. Barry may not be all that your fancy hasimagined.""Decidedly not.""But he has those good qualities which your reason should appreciate.Think it over, my darling. And now we will say nothing more about Mr.Barry till he shall have been here and pleaded his own cause."Then there was not another word said on the subject between them, and onthe next morning Mr. Grey went away to his chambers as usual.Though she had strenuously opposed her father through the whole of theconversation above given, still, as it had gone on, she had resolved todo as he would her; not indeed, that is, to marry this suitor, but toturn him over in her mind yet once again, and find out whether it wouldbe possible that she should do so. She had dismissed him on that formeroccasion, and had not since given a thought to him, except as to anuisance of which she had so far ridded herself. Now the nuisance hadcome again, and she was to endeavor to ascertain how far she couldaccustom herself to its perpetual presence without incurring perpetualmisery. But it has to be acknowledged that she did not begin the inquiryin a fair frame of mind. She declared to herself that she would thinkabout it all the night and all the morning without a prejudice, so thatshe might be able to accept him if she found it possible.But at the same time there was present to her a high, black stone wall,at one side of which stood she herself while Mr. Barry was on the other.That there should be any clambering over that wall by either of them shefelt to be quite impossible, though at the same time she acknowledgedthat a miracle might occur by which the wall would be removed,So she began her thinking, and used all her father's arguments. Mr.Barry was honest and good, and would not ill-treat her. She knew nothingabout him, but would take all that for granted as though it weregospel,--because her father had said so. And then it was to her a factthat she was by no means good-looking,--the meaning of which was that noother man would probably want her. Then she remembered her father'swords,--"To me your face is the sweetest thing on earth to look upon."This she did believe. Her plainness did not come against her there. Whyshould she rob her father of the one thing which to him was sweet in theworld? And to her, her father was the one noble human being whom she hadever known. Why should she rob herself of his daily presence? Then shetold herself,--as she had told him,--that she had never had five minutesfree conversation with Mr. Barry in her life. That certainly was noreason why free conversation should not be commenced. But then she didnot believe that free conversation was within the capacity of Mr. Barry.It would never come, though she might be married to him for twentyyears. He too might, perhaps, talk about his business; but there wouldbe none of those considerations as to radical good or evil which madethe nucleus of all such conversations with her father. There would be aflatness about it all which would make any such interchange of wordsimpossible. It would be as though she had been married to a log of wood,or rather a beast of the field, as regarded all sentiment. How muchmoney would be coming to him? Now her father had never told her how muchmoney was coming to him. There had been no allusion to that branch ofthe subject.And then there came other thoughts as to that interior life which itwould be her destiny to lead with Mr. Barry. Then came a black cloudupon her face as she sat thinking of it. "Never," at last she said,"never, never! He is very foolish not to know that it is impossible."The "he" of whom she then spoke was her father, and not Mr. Barry. "If Ihave to be left alone, I shall not be the first. Others have been leftalone before me. I shall at any rate be left alone." Then the wallbecame higher and more black than ever, and there was no coming of thatmiracle by which it was to be removed. It was clearer to her than everthat neither of them could climb it. "And, after all," she said toherself, "to know that your husband is not a gentleman! Ought that notto be enough? Of course a woman has to pay for her fastidiousness. Likeother luxuries, it is costly; but then, like other luxuries, it cannotbe laid aside." So, before that morning was gone, she made up her mindsteadily that Mr. Barry should never be her lord and master.How could she best make him understand that it was so, so that she mightbe quickly rid of him? When the first hour of thinking was done afterbreakfast, it was that which filled her mind. She was sure that he wouldnot take an answer easily and go. He would have been prepared by herfather to persevere,--not by his absolute words, but by his mode ofspeaking. Her father would have given him to understand that she wasstill in doubt, and therefore might possibly be talked over. She mustteach him at once, as well as she could, that such was not hercharacter, and that she had come to a resolution which left him nochance. And she was guilty of one weakness which was almost unworthy ofher. When the time came she changed her dress, and put on an old shabbyfrock, in which she was wont to call upon the Carrolls. Her best dresseswere all kept for her father,--and, perhaps, accounted for that opinionthat to his eyes her face was the sweetest thing on earth to look upon.As she sat there waiting for Mr. Barry, she certainly did look ten yearsolder than her age.In truth both Mr. Grey and Dolly had been somewhat mistaken in theirreading of Mr. Barry's character. There was more of intellect and meritin him than he had obtained credit for from either of them. He did carevery much for the income of the business, and perhaps his first idea inlooking for Dolly's hand had been the probability that he would thusobtain the whole of that income for himself. But, while wanting money,he wanted also some of the good things which ought to accompany it. Asuperior intellect,--an intellect slightly superior to his own, of whichhe did not think meanly, a power of conversation which he might imitate,and that fineness of thought which, he flattered himself, he might beable to achieve while living with the daughter of a gentleman,--thesewere the treasures which Mr. Barry hoped to gain by his marriage withDorothy Grey. And there had been something in her personal appearancewhich, to his eyes, had not been distasteful. He did not think her facethe sweetest thing in the world to look at, as her father had done, buthe saw in it the index of that intellect which he had desired to obtainfor himself. As for her dress, that, of course, should all be altered.He imagined that he could easily become so far master of his wife as tomake her wear fine clothes without difficulty. But then he did not knowDolly Grey.He had studied deeply his manner of attacking her. He would be veryhumble at first, but after a while his humility should be discontinued,whether she accepted or rejected him. He knew well that it did notbecome a husband to be humble; and as regarded a lover, he thought thathumility was merely the outside gloss of love-making. He had beenhumble enough on the former occasion, and would begin now in the samestrain. But after a while he would stir himself, and assume the mannerof a man. "Miss Grey," he said, as soon as they were alone, "you seethat I have been as good as my word, and have come again." He hadalready observed her old frock and her mode of dressing up her hair, andhad guessed the truth."I knew that you were to come, Mr. Barry.""Your father has told you so.""Yes.""And he has spoken a good word in my favor?""Yes, he has.""Which I trust will be effective.""Not at all. He knows that it is the only subject on which I cannot takehis advice. I would burn my hand off for my father, but I cannot affordto give it to any one at his instance. It must be exclusively myown,--unless some one should come very different from those who arelikely to ask for it."There was something, Mr. Barry thought, of offence in this, but he couldnot altogether throw off his humility as yet. "I quite admit the valueof the treasure," he said."There need not be any nonsense between us, Mr. Barry. It has no specialvalue to any one,--except to myself; but to myself I mean to keep it. Atmy father's instance I had thought over the proposition you have made memuch more seriously than I had thought it possible that I should do.""That is not flattering," he said."There is no need for flattery, either on the one side or on the other.You had better take that as established. You have done me the honor ofwishing, for certain reasons, that I should be your wife.""The common reason:--that I love you.""But I am not able to return the feeling, and do not therefore wish thatyou should be my husband. That sounds to be uncivil.""Rather.""But I say it in order to make you understand the exact truth. A womancannot love a man because she feels for him even the most profoundrespect. She will often do so when there is neither respect nor esteem.My father has so spoken of you to me that I do esteem you; but that hasno effect in touching my heart, therefore I cannot become your wife."Now, as Mr. Barry thought, had come the time in which he must asserthimself. "Miss Grey," he said, "you have probably a long life beforeyou.""Long or short, it can make no difference.""If I understood you aright, you are one who lives very much toyourself.""To myself and my father.""He is growing in years.""So am I, for the matter of that. We are all growing in years.""Have you looked out for yourself, and thought what manner of home yourswill be when he shall have been dead and buried?" He paused, but sheremained silent, and assumed a special cast of countenance, as thoughshe might say a word, if he pressed her, which it would be disagreeablefor him to hear. "When he has gone will you not be very solitary withouta husband?""No doubt I shall.""Had you not better accept one when one comes your way who is not, as hetells you, quite unworthy of you?""In spite of such worth solitude would be preferable.""You certainly have a knack, Miss Grey, of making the most unpalatableassertions.""I will make another more unpalatable. Solitude I could bear,--anddeath,--but not such a marriage. You force me to tell you the whole truthbecause half a truth will not suffice.""I have endeavored to be at any rate civil to you," he said."And I have endeavored to save you what trouble I could by beingstraightforward." Still he paused, sitting in his chair uneasily, butlooking as though he had no intention of going. "If you will only takeme at my word and have done with it!" Still he did not move. "I supposethere are young ladies who like this kind of thing, but I have becomeold enough to hate it. I have had very little experience of it, but itis odious to me. I can conceive nothing more disagreeable than to haveto sit still and hear a gentleman declare that he wants to make me hiswife, when I am quite sure that I do not intend to make him my husband.""Then, Miss Grey," he said, rising from his chair suddenly, "I shall bidyou adieu.""Good-bye, Mr. Barry.""Good-bye, Miss Grey. Farewell!" And so he went."Oh, papa, we have had such a scene!" she said, the moment she feltherself alone with her father."You have not accepted him?""Accepted him! Oh dear no! I am sure at this moment he is only thinkinghow he would cut my throat if he could get hold of me.""You must have offended him then very greatly.""Oh, mortally! I said everything I possibly could to offend him. Butthen he would have been here still had I not done so. There was no otherway to get rid of him,--or indeed to make him believe that I was inearnest.""I am sorry that you should have been so ungracious.""Of course I am ungracious. But how can you stand bandying complimentswith a man when it is your object to make him know the very truth thatis in you? It was your fault, papa. You ought to have understood howvery impossible it is that I should marry Mr. Barry."CHAPTER LIII.THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST PLOT.When Mr. Scarborough had written the check and sent it to Mr. Grey, hedid not utter another word on the subject of gambling. "Let us makeanother beginning," he said, as he told his son to make out anothercheck for sixty pounds as his first instalment of the allowance."I do not like to take it," said the son."I don't think you need be scrupulous now with me." That was early inthe morning, at their first interview, about ten o'clock. Later on inthe day Mr. Scarborough saw his son again, and on this occasion kept himin the room some time. "I don't suppose I shall last much longer now,"he said."Your voice is as strong as I ever heard it.""But unfortunately my body does not keep pace with my voice. From whatMerton says, I don't suppose there is above a month left.""I don't see why Merton is to know.""Merton is a good fellow; and if you can do anything for him, do it formy sake.""I will." Then he added, after a pause, "If things go as we expect,Augustus can do more for him than I. Why don't you leave him a sum ofmoney?"Then Miss Scarborough came into the room, and hovered about her brother,and fed him, and entreated him to be silent; but when she had gone hewent back to the subject. "I will tell you why, Mountjoy. I have notwished to load my will with other considerations,--so that it might beseen that solicitude for you has been in my last moments my onlythought. Of course I have done you a deep injury.""I think you have.""And because you tell me so I like you all the better. As forAugustus--But I will not burden my spirit now, at the last, withuttering curses against my own son.""He is not worth it.""No, he is not worth it. What a fool he has been not to have understoodme better! Now, you are not half as clever a fellow as he is.""I dare say not.""You never read a book, I suppose?""I don't pretend to read them, which he does.""I don't know anything about that;--but he has been utterly unable toread me. I have poured out my money with open hands for both of you.""That is true, sir, certainly, as regards me.""And have thought nothing of it. Till it was quite hopeless with you Iwent on, and would have gone on. As things were then, I was bound to dosomething to save the property.""These poor devils have put themselves out of the running now," saidMountjoy."Yes; Augustus with his suspicions has enabled us to do that. After all,he was quite right with his suspicions.""What do you mean by that, sir?""Well, it was natural enough that he should not trust me. I think, too,that perhaps he saw a screw loose where old Grey did not; but he wassuch an ass that he could not bring himself to keep on good terms withme for the few months that were left. And then he brought that bruteJones down here, without saying a word to me as to asking my leave. Andhere he used to remain, hardly ever coming to see me, but waiting for mydeath from day to day. He is a cold-blooded, selfish brute. He certainlytakes after neither his father nor his mother. But he will find yet,perhaps, that I am even with him before all is over.""I shall try it on with him, sir. I have told you so from the beginning;and now if I have this money it will give me the means of doing so. Youought to know for what purpose I shall use it.""That is all settled," said the father. "The document, properlycompleted, has gone back with the clerk. Were I to die this minute youwould find that everything inside the house is your own,--and everythingoutside except the bare acres. There is a lot of plate with the bankerwhich I have not wanted of late years. And there are a lot of trinketstoo,--things which I used to fancy, though I have not cared so much aboutthem lately. And there are a few pictures which are worth money. But thebooks are the most valuable; only you do not care for them.""I shall not have a house to put them in.""There is no saying. What an idiot, what a fool, what a blind,unthinking ass Augustus has been!""Do you regret it, sir,--that he should not have them and the house too?""I regret that my son should have been such a fool! I did not expectthat he should love me. I did not even want him to be kind to me. Had heremained away and been silent, that would have been sufficient. But hecame here to enjoy himself, as he looked about the park which he thoughtto be his own, and insulted me because I would not die at once and leavehim in possession. And then he was fool enough to make way for youagain, and did not perceive that by getting rid of your creditors heonce again put you into a position to be his rival. I don't know whetherI hate him most for the hardness of his heart, or despise him for theslowness of his intellect."During the time that these words had been spoken Miss Scarborough hadonce or twice come into the room, and besought her brother to take somerefreshment which she offered him, and then give himself up to rest. Buthe had refused to be guided by her till he had come to a point in theconversation at which he had found himself thoroughly exhausted. Now shecame for the third time, and that period had arrived, so that Mountjoywas told to go about his business, and shoot birds or hunt foxes, inaccordance with his natural proclivities. It was then three o'clock on agloomy December afternoon, and was too late for the shooting of birds;and as for the hunting of foxes, the hounds were not in theneighborhood. So he resolved to go through the house, and look at allthose properties which were so soon to become his own. And he at oncestrolled into the library. This was a long, gloomy room, which containedperhaps ten thousand volumes, the greater number of which had, in thedays of Mountjoy's early youth, been brought together by his own father;and they had been bound in the bindings of modern times, so that theshelves were bright, although the room itself was gloomy. He took outbook after book, and told himself, with something of sadness in hisheart, that they were all "caviare" to him. Then he reminded himselfthat he was not yet thirty years of age, and that there was surely timeenough left for him to make them his companions.He took one at random, and found it to be a volume of Clarendon's"History of the Rebellion." He pitched upon a sentence in which hecounted that there were sixteen lines, and when he began to read it, itbecame to him utterly confused and unintelligible. So he put it back,and went to another portion of the room and took down Wittier's"Hallelujah;" and of this he could make neither head nor tail. He wasinformed, by a heading in the book itself, that a piece of poetry was tobe sung "as the ten commandments." He could not do that, and put thebook back again, and declared to himself that farther search would beuseless. He looked round the room and tried to price the books, and toldhimself that three or four days at the club might see an end of it all.Then he wandered on into the state drawing-room,--an apartment which hehad not entered for years,--and found that all the furniture wascarefully covered. Of what use could it all be to him,--unless that it,too, might be sent to the melting-pot and brought into some short-liveduse at the club?But as he was about to leave the room he stood for a moment on the rugbefore the fireplace and looked into the huge mirror which stood there.If the walls might be his, as well as the garnishing of them, and ifFlorence Mountjoy could come and reign there, then he fancied that theyall might be put to a better purpose than that of which he had thought.In earlier days, two or three years ago, at a time which now seemed tohim to be very distant, he had regarded Florence as his own, and as suchhad demanded her hand. In the pride of his birth, and position, andfashion, he had had no thought of her feelings, and had been imperious.He told himself that it had been so with much self-condemnation. At anyrate, he had learned, during those months of solitary wandering, thepower of condemning himself. And now he told him that if she would yetcome he might still learn to sing that song of the old-fashioned poet"as to the ten commandments." At any rate, he would endeavor to sing it,as she bade him.He went on through all the bedrooms, remembering, but hardly more thanremembering, them as he entered them. "Oh, Florence,--my Florence!" hesaid, as he passed on. He had done it all for himself,--brought downupon his own head this infinite ruin,--and for what? He had scarcely everwon, and Tretton was gone from him forever. But still there might yet bea chance if he could abstain from gambling.And then, when it was dusk within the house, he went out, and passedthrough the stables and roamed about the gardens till the evening hadaltogether set in, and black night had come upon him. Two years ago hehad known that he was the heir to it all, though even then that habitwas so strong upon him he had felt that his tenure of it would be butslight. But he had then always to tell himself that when his marriagehad taken place a great change would be effected. His marriage had nottaken place, and the next fatal year had fallen upon him. As long as theinheritance of the estate was certainly his, he could assuredly raisemoney,--at a certain cost. It was well known that the property was risingin value, and the money had always been forthcoming,--at a tremendoussacrifice. He had excused to himself his recklessness on the ground ofhis delayed marriage, but still always treating her, on the fewoccasions on which they had met, with an imperiousness which had beennatural to him. Then the final crash had come, and the estate was asgood as gone. But the crash, which had been in truth final, had comeafterward, almost as soon as his father had learned what was to be thefate of Tretton; and he had found himself to be a bastard with adishonored mother,--just a nobody in the eyes of the world. And helearned at the same time that Harry Annesley was the lover whom FlorenceMountjoy really loved. What had followed has been told already,--perhapstoo often.But at this moment, as he stood in the gloom of the night, below theporch in the front of the house, swinging his stick at the top of thebig steps, an acknowledgment of contrition was very heavy upon him.Though he was prepared to go to law the moment that Augustus put himselfforward as the eldest son, he did recognize how long-suffering hisfather had been, and how much had been done for him in order, ifpossible, to preserve him. And he knew, whatever might be the result ofhis lawsuit, that his father's only purpose had been to save theproperty for one of them. As it was, legacies which might be valued atperhaps thirty thousand pounds would be his. He would expend it all onthe lawsuit, if he could find lawyers to undertake his suit. His anger,too, against his brother was quite as hot as was that of his father.When he had been obliterated and obliged to vanish, from the jointeffects of his violence in the streets and his inability to pay hisgambling debts at the club, he had, in an evil moment, submitted himselfto Augustus; and from that hour Augustus had become to him the mostcruel of tyrants. And this tyranny had come to an end with his absolutebanishment from his brother's house. Though he had been subdued toobedience in the lowest moment of his fall, he was not the man who couldbear such tyranny well. "I can forgive my father," he said, "butAugustus I will never forgive." Then he went into the house, and in ashort time was sitting at dinner with Merton, the young doctor andsecretary. Miss Scarborough seldom came to table at that hour, butremained in a room up-stairs, close to her brother, so that she might bewithin call should she be wanted. "Upon the whole, Merton," he said,"what do you think of my father?" The doctor shrugged his shoulders."Will he live or will he die?""He will die, certainly.""Do not joke with me. But I know you would not joke on such a subject.And my question did not merely go to the state of his health. What doyou think of him as a man generally? Do you call him an honest man?""How am I to answer you?""Just the truth.""If you will have an answer, I do not consider him an honest man. Allthis story about your brother is true or is not true. In neither casecan one look upon him as honest.""Just so.""But I think that he has within him a capacity for love, and anunselfishness, which almost atones for his dishonesty; and there isabout him a strange dislike to conventionality and to law which is sointeresting as to make up the balance. I have always regarded yourfather as a most excellent man, but thoroughly dishonest. He would robany one,--but always to eke out his own gifts to other people. He has,therefore, to my eyes been most romantic.""And as to his health?""Ah, as to that I cannot answer so decidedly. He will do nothing becauseI tell him.""Do you mean that you could prolong his life?""Certainly I think that I could. He has exerted himself this morning,whereas I have advised him not to exert himself. He could have givenhimself the same counsel, and would certainly live longer by obeying itthan the reverse. As there is no difficulty in the matter, there needbe no conceit on my part in saying that so far my advice might be ofservice to him.""How long will he live?""Who can say? Sir William Brodrick, when that fearful operation wasperformed in London, thought that a month would see the end of it. Thatis eight months ago, and he has more vitality now than he had then. Formyself, I do not think that he can live another month."Later on in the evening Mountjoy Scarborough began again. "The governorthinks that you have behaved uncommonly well to him.""I am paid for it all.""But he has not left you anything by his will.""I have certainly expected nothing, and there could be no reason why heshould.""He has entertained an idea of late that he wishes to make whatreparation may be possible to me; and therefore, as he says, he does notchoose to burden his will with legacies. There is some provision madefor my aunt, who, however, has her own fortune. He has told me to lookafter you.""It will be quite unnecessary," said Mr. Merton."If you choose to cut up rough you can do so. I would propose that weshould fix upon some sum which shall be yours at his death,--just asthough he had left it to you. Indeed, he shall fix the sum himself."Merton, of course, said that nothing of the kind would be necessary; butwith this understanding Mountjoy Scarborough went that night to bed.Early on the following morning his father again sent for him."Mountjoy," he said, "I have thought much about it, and I have changedmy mind.""About your will?""No, not about my will at all. That shall remain as it is. I do notthink I should have strength to make another will, nor do I wish to doso.""You mean about Merton?""I don't mean about Merton at all. Give him five hundred pounds, and heought to be satisfied. This is a matter of more importance than Mr.Merton--or even than my will.""What is it?" said Mountjoy, in a tone of much surprise."I don't think I can tell you now. But it is right that you should knowthat Merton wrote, by my instructions, to Mr. Grey early this morning,and has implored him to come to Tretton once again. There! I cannot saymore than that now." Then he turned round on his couch, as was hiscustom, and was unassailable.CHAPTER LIV.RUMMELSBURG.Mr. Scarborough again sent for Mr. Grey, but a couple of weeks passedbefore he came. At first he refused to come, saying that he would sendhis clerk down if any work were wanted such as the clerk might do. Andthe clerk did come and was very useful. But Mr. Scarborough persevered,using arguments which Mr. Grey found himself unable at last to resist.He was dying, and there would soon be an end of it. That was hisstrongest argument. Then it was alleged that a lawyer of experience wascertainly needed, and that Mr. Scarborough could not very well put hisaffairs into the hands of a stranger. And old friendship was brought up.And, then, at last, the squire alleged that there were other secrets tobe divulged respecting his family, of which Mr. Scarborough thought thatMr. Grey would approve. What could be the "other secrets?" But it endedin Mr. Grey assenting to go, in opposition to his daughter's advice. "Iwould have nothing more to do with him or his secrets," Dolly had said."You do not know him.""I know as much about him as a woman can know of a man she doesn'tknow,--and all from yourself. You have said over and over again that heis a 'rascal!'""Not a rascal. I don't think I said he was a rascal.""I believe you used that very word.""Then I unsay it. A rascal has something mean about him. Juniper's arascal!""He cares nothing for his word.""Nothing at all,--when the law is concerned.""And he has defamed his own wife.""That was done many years ago.""For a fixed purpose, and not from passion," Dolly continued. "He is athoroughly bad man. You have made his will for him, and now I wouldleave him." After that Mr. Grey declined for a second time to go. But atlast he was persuaded.On the evening of his arrival he dined with Mountjoy and Merton, and onthat occasion Miss Scarborough joined them. Of course there was muchsurmise as to the cause of this farther visit. Merton declared that, ashe had acted as the sick man's private secretary, he was bound to keephis secret as far as he knew it. He only surmised what he believed to bethe truth, but of that he could say nothing. Miss Scarborough wasaltogether in the dark. She, and she alone, spoke of her brother withrespect, but in that she knew nothing."I cannot tell what it is," said Mountjoy; "but I suspect it to besomething intended for my benefit and for the utter ruin of Augustus."Miss Scarborough had now retired. "If it could be possible, I shouldthink that he intended to declare that all he had said before wasfalse." To this, however, Mr. Grey would not listen. He was very stoutin denying the possibility of any reversion of the decision to whichthey had all come. Augustus was, undoubtedly, by law his father's eldestson. He had seen with his own eyes copies of the registry of themarriage, which Mr. Barry had gone across the Continent to make. And inthat book his wife had signed her maiden name, according to the customof the country. This had been done in the presence of the clergyman andof a gentleman,--a German, then residing on the spot, who had himselfbeen examined, and had stated that the wedding, as a wedding, had beenregular in all respects. He was since dead, but the clergyman who hadmarried them was still alive. Within twelve months of that time Mr.Scarborough and his bride had arrived in England, and Augustus had beenborn. "Nothing but the most indisputable evidence would have sufficed toprove a fact by which you were so cruelly wronged," he said, addressinghimself to Mountjoy. "And when your father told me that no wrong couldbe done to you, as the property was hopelessly in the hands of the Jews,I told him that, for all purposes of the law, the Jews were as dear tome as you were. I do say that nothing but the most certain facts wouldhave convinced me. Such facts, when made certain, are immovable. If yourfather has any plot for robbing Augustus, he will find me as staunch afriend to Augustus as ever I have been to you." When he had so spokenthey separated for the night, and his words had been so strong that theyhad altogether affected Mountjoy. If such were his father's intentions,it must be by some farther plot that he endeavored to carry it out: andin his father's plots he would put no trust whatever.And yet he declared his own purpose as he discussed the matter, lateinto the night, with Merton. "I cannot trust Grey at all, nor my fathereither, because I do not believe, as Grey believes, this story of themarriage. My father is so clever, and so resolute in his purpose to setaside all control over the property as arranged by law, that to my mindit has all been contrived by himself. Either Mr. Barry has been squared,or the German parson, or the foreign gentleman, or more probably all ofthem. Mr. Grey himself may have been squared, for all I know, though heis the kindest-hearted gentleman I ever came across. Anything shall bemore probable to me than that I am not my father's eldest son." To allthis Mr. Merton said very little, though no doubt he had his own ideas.The next morning the three gentlemen, with Mr. Grey's clerk, sat down tobreakfast, solemn and silent. The clerk had been especially entreated tosay nothing of what he had learned, and was therefore not questioned byhis master. But in truth he had learned but little, having spent histime in the sorting and copying of letters which, though they all boreupon the subject in hand, told nothing of the real tale. Farthersurmises were useless now, as at eleven o'clock Mr. Grey and Mr. Mertonwere to go up together to the squire's room. The clerk was to remainwithin call, but there would be no need of Mountjoy. "I suppose I may aswell go to bed," said he, "or up to London, or anywhere." Mr. Grey verysententiously advised him at any rate not to go up to London.The hour came, and Mr. Grey, with Merton and the clerk, disappearedup-stairs. They were summoned by Miss Scarborough, who seemed to feelheavily the awful solemnity of the occasion. "I am sure he is going todo something very dreadful this time," she whispered to Mr. Grey, whoseemed himself to be a little awe-struck, and did not answer her.At two o'clock they all met again at lunch and Mr. Grey was silent, andin truth very unhappy. Merton and the clerk were also silent, as wasMiss Scarborough,--silent as death. She, indeed, knew nothing, but theother three knew as much as Mr. Scarborough could or would tell them.Mountjoy was there also, and in the middle of the meal broke outviolently: "Why the mischief don't you tell me what it is that my fatherhas said to you?""Because I do not believe a word of his story," said Mr. Grey."Oh, Mr Grey!" ejaculated Miss Scarborough."I do not believe a word of his story," repeated Mr. Grey. "Yourfather's intelligence is so high, and his principles so low, that thereis no scheme which he does not think that he cannot carry out againstthe established laws of his country. His present tale is a made-upfable.""What do you say, Merton?" asked Mountjoy."It looks to me to be true," said Merton. "But I am no lawyer.""Why don't you tell me what it is?" said Mountjoy."I cannot tell you," said Grey, "though he commissioned me to do so.Greenwood there will tell you." Greenwood was the name of the clerk."But I advise you to take him with you to your own room. And Mr. Mertonwould, I am sure, go with you. As for me, it would be impossible that Ishould do credit in the telling of it to a story of which I do notbelieve a single word.""Am I not to know?" asked Miss Scarborough, plaintively."Your nephew will tell you," said Mr. Grey,--"or Mr. Merton; or Mr.Greenwood can do so, if he has permission from Mr. Scarborough. I wouldrather tell no one. It is to me incredible." With that he got up andwalked away."Now then, Merton," said Mountjoy, rising from his chair."Upon my word I hardly know what to do," said Merton."You must come and tell me this wonderful tale. I suppose that in someway it does affect my interests?""It affects your interests very much.""Then I think I may say that I certainly shall believe it. My father atpresent would not wish to do me an injury. It must be told, so comealong. Mr. Greenwood had better come also." Then he left the room, andthe two men followed him. They went away to the smoking-room, leavingMr. Grey with Miss Scarborough. "Am I to know nothing about it?" saidMiss Scarborough."Not from me, Miss Scarborough. You can understand, that I cannot tellyou a story which will require at every word that I should explain mythorough disbelief in your brother. I have been very angry with him, andhe has been more energetic than can have been good for him.""Ah me! you will have killed him among you!""It has been his own doing. You, however, had better go to him. I mustreturn to town this evening.""You will stay for dinner?""No. I cannot stay for dinner. I cannot sit down with Mountjoy,--who hasdone nothing in the least wrong,--because I feel myself to be altogetheropposed to his interests. I would rather be out of the house." Sosaying he did leave the house, and went back to London by train thatafternoon.The meeting that morning, which had been very stormy, cannot be givenword by word. From the moment in which the squire had declared hispurpose, the lawyer had expressed his disbelief in all that was said tohim. This Mr. Scarborough had at first taken very kindly; but Mr. Greyclung to his purpose with a pertinacity which had at last beaten downthe squire's good-humor, and had called for the interference of Mr.Merton. "How can I be quiet?" the squire had said, "when he tells meeverything I say is a lie?""It is a lie!" said Mr. Grey, who had lost all control of himself."You should not say that, Mr. Grey," said Merton."He should spare a man on his death-bed, who is endeavoring to do hisduty by his children," said the man who thus declared himself to bedying."I will go away," said Mr. Grey, rising. "He has forced me to come hereagainst my will, and has known,--must have known,--that I should tell himwhat I thought. Even though a man be dying, a man cannot accept what hesays on a matter of business such as this unless he believe him. I musttell him that I believe him or that I do not. I disbelieve the wholestory, and will not act upon it as though I believed it." But even afterthis the meeting was continued, Mr. Grey consenting to sit there and tohear what was said to the end.The purport of Mr. Scarborough's story will probably have beenunderstood by our readers. It was Mr. Scarborough's present intention tomake it understood that the scheme intended for the disinheritance ofMountjoy had been false from the beginning to the end, and had beenarranged, not for the injury of Mountjoy, but for the salvation of theestate from the hands of the Jews. Mountjoy would have lost nothing, asthe property would have gone entirely to the Jews had Mr. Scarboroughthen died, and Mountjoy been taken as his legitimate heir. He was notanxious, he had declared, to say anything on the present occasion indefence of his conduct in that respect. He would soon be gone, and hewould leave men to judge him who might do so the more honestly when theyshould have found that he had succeeded in paying even the Jews in fullthe moneys which they had actually advanced. But now things were againchanged, and he was bound to go back to the correct order of things."No!" shouted Mr. Grey."To the correct order of things," he went on. Mountjoy Scarborough was,he declared, undoubtedly legitimate. And then he made Merton and theclerk bring forth all the papers, as though he had never brought forthany papers to prove the other statement to Mr. Grey. And he did expectMr. Grey to believe them. Mr. Grey simply put them all back,metaphorically, with his hand. There had been two marriages, absolutelyprepared with the intent of enabling him at some future time to upsetthe law altogether, if it should seem good to him to do so."And your wife?" shouted Mr. Grey."Dear woman! She would have done anything that I told her,--unless I hadtold her to do what was absolutely wrong.""Not wrong!""Well, you know what I mean. She was the purest and best of women." Thenhe went on with his tale. There had been two marriages, and he nowbrought forth all the evidence of the former marriage. It had takenplace in a remote town, a village in the northern part of Prussia,whither she had been taken by her mother to join him. The two ladies hadboth been since long dead. He had been laid up at the little Prussiantown under the plea of a bad leg. He did not scruple to say now that thebad leg had been pretence, and a portion of his scheme. The law, hethought, in endeavoring to make arrangements for his property,--theproperty which should have been his own,--had sinned so greatly as todrive a wise man to much scheming. He had begun scheming early in thebusiness. But for his bad leg the old lady would not have brought herdaughter to be married at so out-of-the-way a place as Rummelsburg, inPomerania. He had travelled about and found Rummelsburg peculiarlyfitted for his enterprise. There was a most civil old Lutheran clergymanthere, to whom he had made himself peculiarly acceptable. He had nowcertified copies of the registry at Rummelsburg, which left no loop-holefor doubt. But he had felt that probably no inquiry would have been madeabout what had been done thirty years ago at Rummelsburg, had he himselfdesired to be silent on the subject. "There will be no difficulty," hesaid, "in making the Rummelsburg marriage known to all the world.""I think there will;--very great difficulty," Mr. Grey had said."Not the least. But when I had to be married in the light of day, afterMountjoy's birth, at Nice, in Italy, then there was the difficulty. Ithad to be done in the light of day; and that little traveller with hisnurse were with us. Nice was in Italy then, and some contrivance was, Iassure you, necessary. But it was done, and I have always had with methe double sets of certificates. As things have turned up, I have had tokeep Mr. Grey altogether in the dark as regards Rummelsburg. It was verydifficult; but I have succeeded."That Mr. Grey should have been almost driven to madness by such anoutrage as this was a matter of course. But he preferred to believe thatRummelsburg, and not Nice, was the myth. "How did your wife travel withyou during the whole of that year?" he had asked."As Mrs. Scarborough, no doubt. But we had been very little in society,and the world at large seemed willing to believe almost anything of methat was wrong. However, there's the Rummelsburg marriage, and if yousend to Rummelsburg you'll find that it's all right,--a little whitechurch up a corner, with a crooked spire. The old clergyman is, nodoubt, dead, but I should imagine that they would keep their registers."Then he explained how he had travelled about the world with the two setsof certificates, and had made the second public when his object had beento convert Augustus into his eldest son. Many people then had been foundwho had remembered something of the marriage at Nice, and remembered tohave remembered something at the time of having been in possession ofsome secret as to the lady. But Rummelsburg had been kept quite in thedark. Now it was necessary that a strong light should be thrown on theabsolute legality of the Rummelsburg marriage.He declared that he had more than once made up his mind to destroy thoseRummelsburg documents, but had always been deterred by the reflectionthat, when they were once gone, they could not be brought back again. "Ihad always intended," he had said, "to burn the papers the last thingbefore my death. But as I learned Augustus's character, I made quitecertain by causing them to be sealed up in a parcel addressed to him, sothat if I had died by accident they might have fallen into proper hands.But I see now the wickedness of my project, and, therefore, I give themover to Mr. Grey." So saying he tendered the parcel to the attorney.Mr. Grey, of course, refused to take, or even to touch, the Rummelsburgparcel. He then prepared to leave the room, declaring it would be hisduty to act on the part of Augustus, should Augustus be pleased toaccept his services. But Mr. Scarborough, almost with tears, imploredhim to change his purpose. "Why should you set two brothers by theears?" At this Mr. Grey only shook his head incredulously. "And why ruinthe property without an object?""The property will come to ruin.""Not if you will take the matter up in the proper spirit. But if youdetermine to drive one brother to hostility against the other, andpromote unnecessary litigation, of course the lawyers will get it all."Then Mr. Grey left the room, boiling with anger in that he, with hislegal knowledge and determination to do right, had been so utterlythrown aside; while Mr. Scarborough sank exhausted by the effort he hadgone through.CHAPTER LV.MR. GREY'S REMORSE.Mr. Grey's feeling, as he returned home, was chiefly one ofself-reproach; so that, though he persisted in not believing the storywhich had been told to him, he did, in truth, believe it. He believed,at any rate, in Mr. Scarborough. Mr. Scarborough had determined that theproperty should go hither and thither according to his will, withoutreference to the established laws of the land, and had carried, andwould carry his purpose. His object had been to save his estate from thehands of those harpies, the money-lenders; and as far as he wasconcerned he would have saved it.He had, in fact, forced the money-lenders to lend their money withoutinterest and without security, and then to consent to accept theirprincipal when it was offered to them. No one could say but that thedeed when done was a good deed. But this man in doing it had driven hiscoach and horses through all the laws, which were to Mr. Grey as HolyWrit; and, in thus driving his coach and horses, he had forced Mr. Greyto sit upon the box and hold the reins. Mr. Grey had thought himself tobe a clever man,--at least a well-instructed man; but Mr. Scarborough hadturned him round his finger, this way and that way, just as he hadpleased.Mr. Grey when, in his rage, he had given the lie to Mr. Scarborough had,no doubt, spoken as he had believed at that moment. To him the newstory must have sounded like a lie, as he had been driven to accept theveritable lie as real truth. He had looked into all the circumstances ofthe marriage at Nice, and had accepted it. He had sent his partner over,and had picked up many incidental confirmations. That there had been amarriage at Nice between Mr. Scarborough and the mother of Augustus wascertain. He had traced back Mr. Scarborough's movements before themarriage, and could not learn where the lady had joined him whoafterward became his wife; but it had become manifest to him that shehad travelled with him, bearing his name. But in Vienna Mr. Barry hadlearned that Mr. Scarborough had called the lady by her maiden name. Hemight have learned that he had done so very often at other places; butit had all been done in preparation for the plot in hand,--as had scoresof other little tricks which have not cropped up to the surface in thisnarrative.Mr. Scarborough's whole life had been passed in arranging tricks for thedefeat of the law; and it had been his great glory so to arrange them asto make it impossible that the law should touch him. Mountjoy haddeclared that he had been defrauded. The creditors swore, with manyoaths, that they had been horribly cheated by this man. Augustus, nodoubt, would so swear very loudly. No man could swear more loudlythan did Mr. Grey as he left the squire's chamber after this lastrevelation. But there was no one who could punish him. The money-lendershad no writing under his hand. Had Mountjoy been born without amarriage-ceremony it would have been very wicked, but the vengeance ofthe law would not have reached him. If you deceive your attorney withfalse facts he cannot bring you before the magistrates. Augustus hadbeen the most injured of all; but a son, though he may bring an actionagainst his father for bigamy, cannot summon him before any tribunalbecause he has married his mother twice over. These were Mr.Scarborough's death-bed triumphs; but they were very sore upon Mr. Grey.On his journey back to town, as he turned the facts over more coolly inhis mind, he began to fear that he saw a glimmer of the truth. Before hereached London he almost thought that Mountjoy would be the heir. He hadnot brought a scrap of paper away with him, having absolutely refused totouch the documents offered to him. He certainly would not be employedagain either by Mr. Scarborough or on behalf of his estate or hisexecutors. He had threatened that he would take up the cudgels onbehalf of Augustus, and had felt at the moment that he was bound to doso, because, as he had then thought, Augustus had the right cause. Butas that idea crumbled away from him, Augustus and his affairs becamemore and more distasteful to him. After all, it ought to be wished thatMountjoy should become the elder son,--even Mountjoy, the incurablegambler. It was terrible to Mr. Grey that the old, fixed arrangementshould be unfixed, and certainly there was nothing in the character ofAugustus to reconcile him to such a change.But he was a very unhappy man when he put himself into a cab to becarried down to Fulham. How much better would it have been for him hadhe taken his daughter's advice, and persistently refused to make thislast journey to Tretton! He would have to acknowledge to his daughterthat Mr. Scarborough had altogether got the better of him, and hisunhappiness would consist in the bitterness of that acknowledgment.But when he reached the Manor House his daughter met him with news ofher own which for the moment kept his news in abeyance. "Oh, papa," shesaid, "I am so glad you've come!" He had sent her a telegram to say thathe was coming. "Just when I got your message I was frightened out of mylife. Who do you think was here with me?""How am I to think, my dear?""Mr. Juniper.""Who on earth is Mr. Juniper?" he asked. "Oh, I remember;--Amelia'slover.""Do you mean to say you forgot Mr. Juniper? I never shall forget him.What a horrid man he is!""I never saw Mr. Juniper in my life. What did he want of you?""He says you have ruined him utterly. He came here about two o'clock,and found me at work in the garden. He made his way in through the opengate, and would not be sent back though one of the girls told him thatthere was nobody at home. He had seen me, and I could not turn him out,of course.""What did he say to you? Was he impudent?""He did not insult me, if you mean that; but he was impudent in notgoing away, and I could not get rid of him for an hour. He says that youhave doubly ruined him.""As how?""You would not let Amelia have the fortune that you promised her; and Ithink his object now was to get the fortune without the girl. And hesaid, also, that he had lent five hundred pounds to your CaptainScarborough.""He is not my Captain Scarborough.""And that when you were settling the captain's debts his was the onlyone you would not pay in full.""He is a rogue,--an arrant rogue!""But he says that he's got the captain's name to the five hundredpounds; and he means to get it some of these days, now that the captainand his father are friends again. The long and the short of it is, thathe wants five hundred pounds by hook or by crook, and that he thinks youought to let him have it.""He'll get it, or the greater part of it. There's no doubt he'll get itif he has got the captain's name. If I remember right, the captain didsign a note for him to that amount,--and he'll get the money if he hasstuck to it.""Do you mean that Captain Scarborough would pay all his debts?""He will have to pay that one, because it was not included in theschedule. What do you think has turned up now?""Some other scheme?""It is all scheming,--base, false scheming,--to have been concerned withwhich will be a disgrace to my name forever!""Oh, papa!""Yes; forever! He has told me, now, that Mountjoy is his true,legitimate, eldest son. He declares that that story which I havebelieved for the last eight months has been altogether false, and madeout of his own brain to suit his own purposes. In order to enable him todefraud these money-lenders he used a plot which he had concocted longsince, and boldly declared Augustus to be his heir. He made me believeit; and because I believed it, even those greedy, grasping men, whowould not have given up a tithe of their prey to save the whole family,even they believed it too. Now, at the very point of death, he comesforward with perfect coolness, and tells me that the whole story was aplot made out of his own head.""Do you believe him now?""I became very wroth, and said that it was a lie! I did think that itwas a lie. I did flatter myself that in a matter concerning my ownbusiness, and in which I was bound to look after the welfare of others,he could not have so deceived me; but I find myself as a child--as ababy--in his hands.""Then you do believe him now?""I am afraid so. I will never see him again, if it be possible for me toavoid him. He has treated me as no one should have treated his enemy,let alone a faithful friend. He must have scoffed and scorned at memerely because I had faith in his word. Who could have thought of a manlaying his plots so deeply,--arranging for twenty years past the fraudswhich he has now executed? For thirty years, or nearly, his mind hasbeen busy on these schemes, and on others, no doubt, which he has notthought it necessary to execute, and has used me in them simply as amachine. It is impossible that I should forgive him.""And what will be the end of it?" she asked."Who can say? But this is clear. He has utterly destroyed my characteras a lawyer.""No. Nothing of the kind.""And it will be well if he have not done so as a man. Do you think thatwhen people hear that these changes have been made with my assistancethey will stop to unravel it all, and to see that I have been only afool and not a knave? Can I explain under what stress of entreaty I wentdown there on this last occasion?""Papa, you were quite right to go. He was your old friend, and he wasdying."Even for this he was grateful. "Who will judge me as you do,--you whopersuaded me that I should not have gone? See how the world will use myname! He has made me a party to each of his frauds. He disinheritedMountjoy, and he forced me to believe the evidence he brought. Then,when Mountjoy was nobody, he half paid the creditors by means of myassistance.""They got all they were entitled to get.""No; till the law had decided against them, they were entitled to theirbonds. But they, ruffians though they are, had advanced so much hardmoney, and I was anxious that they should get their hard money backagain. But unless Mountjoy had been illegitimate,--so as to be capable ofinheriting nothing,--they would have been cheated; and they have beencheated. Will it be possible that I should make them or make othersthink that I have had nothing to do with it? And Augustus, who will beopen-mouthed,--what will he say against me? In every turn and double ofthe man's crafty mind I shall be supposed to have turned and doubledwith him. I do not mind telling the truth about myself to you.""I should hope not.""The light that has guided me through my professional life has been alove of the law. As far as my small powers have gone, I have wished topreserve it intact. I am sure that the Law and Justice may be made torun on all-fours. I have been so proud of my country as to make that therule of my life. The chance has brought me into the position of havingfor a client a man the passion of whose life has been the very reverse.Who would not say that for an attorney to have such a man as Mr.Scarborough, of Tretton, for his client, was not a feather in his cap?But I have found him to be not only fraudulent, but too clever for me.In opposition to myself he has carried me into his paths.""He has never induced you to do anything that was wrong.""'Nil conscire sibi;' that ought to be enough for a simple man. But itis not enough for me. It cannot be enough for a man who intends to actas an attorney for others. Others must know it as well as I myself. Youknow it. But can I remain an attorney for you only? There are some ofwhom just the other thing is known; but then they look for work of theother kind. I have never put up a shop-board for sharp practice. Afterthis the sharpest kind of practice will be all that I shall seem to befit for. It isn't the money. I can retire with enough for your wants andfor mine. If I could retire amid the good words of men I should behappy. But, even if I retire, men will say that I have filled my pocketswith plunder from Tretton.""That will never be said.""Were I to publish an account of the whole affair,--which I am bound inhonor not to do,--explaining it all from beginning to end, people wouldonly say that I was endeavoring to lay the whole weight of the guiltupon my confederate who was dead. Why did he pick me out for suchusage,--me who have been so true to him?"There was something almost weak, almost feminine in the tone of Mr.Grey's complaints. But to Dolly they were neither feminine nor weak. Toher her father's grief was true and well-founded; but for herself in herown heart there was some joy to be drawn from it. How would it have beenwith her if the sharp practice had been his, and the success? What wouldhave been her state of mind had she known her father to have conceivedthese base tricks? Or what would have been her condition had her fatherbeen of such a kind as to have taught her that the doing of such tricksshould be indifferent to her? To have been high above them all,--for himand for her,--was not that everything? And was she not sure that thetruth would come to light at last? And if not here, would not the truthcome to light elsewhere where light would be of more avail than here?Such was the consolation with which Dolly consoled herself.On the next two days Mr. Grey went to his chambers and returned, withoutany new word as to Mr. Scarborough and his affairs. One day he did bringback some tidings as to Juniper. "Juniper has got into some row about ahorse," he said, "and is, I fear, in prison. All the same, he'll get hisfive hundred pounds; and if he knew that fact it would help him.""I can't tell him, papa. I don't know where he lives.""Perhaps Carroll could do so.""I never speak to Mr. Carroll. And I would not willingly mentionJuniper's name to my aunt or to either of the girls. It will be betterto let Juniper go on in his row.""With all my heart," said Mr. Grey. And then there was an end of that.On the next morning, the fourth after his return from Tretton, Mr. Greyreceived a letter from Mountjoy Scarborough. "He was sure," he said,"that Mr. Grey would be sorry to hear that his father had been very weaksince Mr. Grey had gone, and unable even to see him, Mountjoy, for morethan two or three minutes at a time. He was afraid that all would soonbe over; but he and everybody around the squire had been surprised tofind how cheerful and high-spirited he was. It seems," wrote Mountjoy,"as though he had nothing to regret, either as regards this world or thenext. He has no remorse, and certainly no fear. Nothing, I think, couldmake him angry, unless the word repentance were mentioned to him. To meand to his sister he is unwontedly affectionate; but Augustus's name hasnot crossed his lips since you left the house." Then he went on to thematter as to which his letter had been written. "What am I to do whenall is over with him? It is natural that I should come to you foradvice. I will promise nothing about myself, but I trust that I may notreturn to the gambling-table. If I have this property to manage, I maybe able to remain down here without going up to London. But shall I havethe property to manage? and what steps am I to take with the view ofgetting it? Of course I shall have to encounter opposition, but I donot think that you will be one of those to oppose me. I presume that Ishall be left here in possession, and that, they say, is nine points ofthe law. In the usual way I ought, I presume, simply to do nothing, butmerely to take possession. The double story about the two marriagesought to count for nothing,--and I should be as though no such plots hadever been hatched. But they have been hatched, and other people know ofthem. The creditors, I presume, can do nothing. You have all the bondsin your possession. They may curse and swear, but will, I imagine, haveno power. I doubt whether they have a morsel of ground on which to raisea lawsuit; for whether I or Augustus be the eldest son, their claimshave been satisfied in full. But I presume that Augustus will not sitquiet. What ought I to do in regard to him? As matters stand at presenthe will not get a shilling. I fear my father is too ill to make anotherwill. But at any rate he will make none in favor of Augustus. Pray tellme what I ought to do; and tell me whether you can send any one down toassist me when my father shall have gone.""I will meddle no farther with anything in which the name of Scarboroughis concerned." Such had been Mr. Grey's first assertion when he receivedMountjoy's letter. He would write to him and tell him that, after whathad passed, there could be nothing of business transacted between himand his father's estate. Nor was he in the position to give any adviceon the subjects mooted. He would wash his hands of it altogether. But,as he went home, he thought over the matter and told himself that itwould be impossible for him thus to repudiate the name. He wouldundertake no lawsuit either on behalf of Augustus or of Mountjoy. But hemust answer Mountjoy's letter, and tender him some advice.During the long hours of the subsequent night he discussed the wholematter with his daughter, and the upshot of his discussion wasthis:--that he would withdraw his name from the business, and leave Mr.Barry to manage it. Mr. Barry might then act for either party as hepleased.CHAPTER LVI.SCARBOROUGH'S REVENGE.All these things were not done at Tretton altogether unknown to AugustusScarborough. Tidings as to the will reached him, and then he firstperceived the injury he had done himself in lending his assistance tothe payment of the creditors. Had his brother been utterly bankrupt, sothat the Jews might have seized any money that might have come to him,his father would have left no will in his favor. All that was nowintelligible to Augustus. The idea that his father should strip thehouse of every stick of furniture, and the estate of every chattel uponit, had not occurred to him before the thing was done.He had thought that his father was indifferent to all personal offence,and therefore he had been offensive. He found out his mistake, andtherefore was angry with himself. But he still thought that he had beenright in regard to the creditors. Had the creditors been left in thepossession of their unpaid bonds, they would have offered terribleimpediments to the taking possession of the property. He had been rightthen, he thought. The fact was that his father had lived too long.However, the property would be left to him, Augustus, and he must makeup his mind to buy the other things from Mountjoy. He at any rate wouldhave to provide the funds out of which Mountjoy must live, and he wouldtake care that he did not buy the chattels twice over. It was thus heconsoled himself till rumors of something worse reached his ears.How the rumors reached him it would be difficult to say. There wereprobably some among the servants who got an inkling of what the squirewas doing when Mr. Grey again came down; or Miss Scarborough had someconfidential friend; or Mr. Grey's clerk may have been indiscreet. Thetidings in some unformed state did reach Augustus and astounded him. Hisbelief in his father's story as to his brother's illegitimacy had beenunfixed and doubtful. Latterly it had verged toward more thorough beliefas the creditors had taken their money,--less than a third of what wouldhave been theirs had the power remained with them of recovering theirfull debt. The creditors had thus proved their belief, and they were apeople not likely to believe such a statement without some foundation.But at any rate he had conceived it to be impossible that his ownfather should go back from his first story, and again make himself outto be doubly a liar and doubly a knave.But if it were so, what should he do? Was it not the case that in suchevent he would be altogether ruined,--a penniless adventurer with hisprofession absolutely gone from him? What little money he had gottogether had been expended on behalf of Mountjoy,--a sprat thrown out tocatch a whale. Everything according to the present tidings had been leftto Mountjoy. He had only half known his father, who had turned againsthim with virulence because of his unkindness. Who could have expectedthat a man in such a condition should have lived so long, and have beencapable of a will so powerful? He had not dreamed of a hatred soinveterate as his father's for him.He received news also from Tretton that his father was not now expectedby any one to live long."It may be a week, the doctors say, and it is hardly possible that heshould remain alive for another month." Such was the news which reachedhim from his own emissary at Tretton. What had he better do in theemergency of the moment?There was only one possibly effective step that he could take. He might,of course, remain tranquil, and accept what chance might give him, whenhis father should have died. But he might at once go down to Tretton anddemand an interview with the dying man. He did not think that hisfather, even on his death-bed, would refuse to see him. His father'spluck was indomitable, and he thought that he could depend on his ownpluck. At any rate he resolved that he would immediately go to Trettonand take his chance. He reached the house about the middle of the day,and at once sent his name up to his father. Miss Scarborough was sittingby her brother's bedside, and from time to time was reading to him a fewwords. "Augustus!" he said, as soon as the servant had left the room."What does Augustus want with me? The last time he saw me he bade me dieout of hand if I wished to retrieve the injury I had done him.""Do not think of that now, John," his sister said."As God is my judge, I will think of it to the last moment. Words suchas those spoken, by a son to his father, demand a little thought. Were Ito tell you that I did not think of them, would you not know that I wasa hypocrite?""You need not speak of them, John.""Not unless he came here to harass my last moments. I strove to do verymuch for him;--you know with what return. Mountjoy has been, at any rate,honest and straightforward; and, considering all things, not lacking inrespect. I shall, at any rate, have some pleasure in letting Augustusknow the state of my mind.""What shall I say to him?" his sister asked."Tell him that he had better go back to London. I have tried them both,as few sons can be tried by their father, and I know them now. Tell him,with my compliments, that it will be better for him not to see me. Therecan be nothing pleasant said between us. I have no communication to maketo him which could in the least interest him."But before night came the squire had been talked over, and had agreed tosee his son. "The interview will be easy enough for me," he had said,"but I cannot imagine what he will get from me. But let him come as hewill."Augustus spent much of the intervening time in discussing the matterwith his aunt. But not a word on the subject was spoken by him toMountjoy, whom he met at dinner, and with whom he spent the evening incompany with Mr. Merton. The two hours after dinner were melancholyenough. The three adjourned to the smoking-room, and sat there almostwithout conversation. A few words were said about the hunting, butMountjoy had not hunted this winter. There were a few also of greaterinterest about the shooting. The shooting was of course still theproperty of the old man, and in the early months had, without many wordsspoken, become, as it were, an appanage of the condition of life towhich Augustus aspired; but of late Mountjoy had assumed the command."You found plenty of pheasants here, I suppose," Augustus remarked."Well, yes; not too many. I didn't trouble myself much about it. When Isaw a pheasant I shot it. I've been a little troubled in spirit, youknow.""Gambling again, I heard.""That didn't trouble me much. Merton can tell you that we've had asick-house.""Yes, indeed," said Merton. "It hasn't seemed to be a time in which aman would think very much of his pheasants.""I don't know why," said Augustus, who was determined not to put up withthe rebuke implied in the doctor's words. After that there was nothingmore said between them till they all went to their separate apartments."Don't contradict him," his aunt said to him the next morning, "and ifhe reprimands you, acknowledge that you have been wrong.""That's hard, when I haven't been wrong.""But so much depends upon it; and he is so stern. Of course, I wish wellfor both of you. There is plenty enough,--plenty; if only you could agreetogether.""But the injustice of his treatment. Is it true that he now declaresMountjoy to be the eldest son?""I believe so. I do not know, but I believe it.""Think of what his conduct has been to me. And then you tell me that Iam to own that I have been wrong! In what have I been wrong?""He is your father, and I suppose you have said hard words to him.""Did I rebuke him because he had fraudulently kept me for so many yearsin the position of a younger son? Did I not forgive him that iniquity?""But he says you are a younger son.""This last move," he said, with great passion, "has only been made in anattempt to punish me, because I would not tell him that I was under aworld of obligations to him for simply declaring the truth as to mybirth. We cannot both be his eldest son.""No, certainly, not both.""At last he declared that I was his heir. If I did say hard words tohim, were they not justified?""Not to your father," said Miss Scarborough, shaking her head."That is your idea? How was I to abstain? Think what had been done tome. Through my whole life he had deceived me, and had attempted to robme.""But he says that he had intended to get the property for you.""To get it! It was mine. According to what he said it was my own. He hadrobbed me to give it to Mountjoy. Now he intends to rob me again inorder that Mountjoy may have it. He will leave such a kettle of fishbehind him, with all his manoeuvring, that neither of us will be thebetter of Tretton."Then he went to the squire. In spite of what had passed between him andhis aunt, he had thought deeply of his conduct to his father in thepast, and of the manner in which he would now carry himself. He wasaware that he had behaved,--not badly, for that he esteemed nothing,--butmost unwisely. When he had found himself to be the heir to Tretton hehad fancied himself to be almost the possessor, and had acted on theinstincts which on such a case would have been natural to him. To havepardoned the man because he was his father, and then to have treated himwith insolent disdain, as some dying old man, almost entirely beneathhis notice, was what he felt the nature of the circumstances demanded.And whether the story was true or false it would have been the same. Hehad come at last to believe it to be true, and had therefore been themore resolute; but, whether it were true or false, the old man hadstruck his blow, and he must abide by it. Till the moment came in whichhe had received that communication from Tretton, the idea had neveroccurred to him that another disposition of the property might still bewithin his father's power. But he had little known the old man's power,or the fertility of his resources, or the extent of his malice. "Afterwhat you have done you should cease to stay and disturb us," he had oncesaid, when his father had jokingly alluded to his own death. He had atonce repented, and had felt that such a speech had been iniquitous ascoming from a son. But his father had, at the moment, expressed no deepanimosity. Some sarcastic words had fallen from him of which Augustushad not understood the bitterness. But he had remembered it since, andwas now not so much surprised at his father's wish to injure him as athis power.But could he have any such power? Mr. Grey, he knew, was on his side,and Mr. Grey was a thorough lawyer. All the world was on his side,--allthe world having been instructed to think and to believe that Mr.Scarborough had not been married till after Mountjoy was born. All theworld had been much surprised, and would be unwilling to encounteranother blow. Should he go into his father's room altogether penitent,or should he hold up his head and justify himself?One thing was brought home to him, by thinking, as a matter of which hemight be convinced. No penitence could now avail him anything. He had atany rate by this time looked sufficiently into his father's character tobe sure that he would not forgive such an offence as had been his. Anyvice, any extravagance, almost any personal neglect, would have beenpardoned. "I have so brought him up," the father would have said, "andthe fault must be counted as my own." But his son had deliberatelyexpressed a wish for his father's death, and had expressed it in hisfather's presence. He had shown not only neglect, which may arise at adistance, and may not be absolutely intentional; but these words hadbeen said with the purpose of wounding, and were, and would be,unpardonable. Augustus, as he went along the corridor to his father'sroom, determined that he would at any rate not be penitent."Well, sir, how do you find yourself?" he said, walking in briskly andputting out his hand to his father. The old man languidly gave his hand,but only smiled. "I hear of you, though not from you, and they tell methat you have not been quite so strong of late.""I shall soon cease to stay and trouble you," said the squire, withaffected weakness, in a voice hardly above a whisper, using the verywords which Augustus had spoken."There have been some moments between us, sir, which have been,unfortunately, unpleasant.""And yet I have done so much to make them pleasant to you! I should havethought that the offer of all Tretton would have gone for much withyou."Augustus was again taken in. There was a piteous whine about hisfather's voice which once more deceived him. He did not dream of thedepth of the old man's anger. He did not imagine that at such a momentit could boil over with such ferocity; nor was he altogether aware ofthe cat-like quietude with which he could pave the way for his lastspring. Mountjoy, by far the least gifted of the two, had gained thetruer insight to his father's character."You had done much, or rather, as I supposed, circumstances had donemuch.""Circumstances?""The facts, I mean, as to Mountjoy's birth and my own.""I have not always left myself to be governed by actual circumstances.""If there was any omission on my part of an expression of properfeeling, I regret it.""I don't know that there was. What is proper feeling? There was nohypocrisy, at any rate.""You sometimes are a little bitter, sir.""I hope you won't find it so when I am gone.""I don't know what I said that has angered you, but I may have beendriven to say what I did not feel.""Certainly not to me.""I'm not here to beg pardon for any special fault, as I do not quiteknow of what I am accused.""Of nothing. There is no accusation at all.""Nor what the punishment is to be. I have learned that you have left toMountjoy all the furniture in the house.""Yes, poor boy!--when I found that you had turned him out.""I never turned him out,--not till your house was open to receive him.""You would not have wished him to go into the poor-house?""I did the very best for him. I kept him going when there was no oneelse to give him a shilling.""He must have had a bitter time," said the father. "I hope it may havedone him good.""I think I behaved to him just as an elder brother should have done. Hewas not particularly grateful, but that was not my fault.""Still, I thought it best to leave him the old sticks about the place.As he was to have the property, it was better that he should have thesticks." As he said this he managed to turn himself round and look hisson full in the face. Such a look as it was! There was the gleam ofvictory, and the glory of triumph, and the venom of malice. "Youwouldn't have them separated, would you?""I have heard of some farther trick of this kind.""Just the ordinary way in which things ought to be allowed to run. Mr.Grey, who is a very good man, persuaded me. No man ought to interferewith the law. An attempt in that direction led to evil. Mountjoy is theeldest son, you know.""I know nothing of the kind.""Oh dear, no! there is no question at all as to the date of my marriagewith your mother. We were married in quite a straightforward way atRummelsburg. When I wanted to save the property from those harpies, Iwas surprised to find how easily I managed it. Grey was a little softthere: an excellent man, but too credulous for a lawyer.""I do not believe a word of it.""You'll find it all go as naturally as possible when I have ceased tostay and be troublesome. But one thing I must say in your favor.""What do you mean?""I never could have managed it all unless you had consented to thatpayment of the creditors. Indeed, I must say, that was chiefly your owndoing. When you first suggested it, I saw what a fine thing you werecontriving for your brother. I should think, after that, of leaving itall so that you need not find out the truth when I am dead. I do thinkI had so managed it that you would have had the property. Mountjoy, whohas some foolish feeling about his mother, and who is obstinate as apig, would have fought it out; but I had so contrived that you wouldhave had it. I had sealed up every document referring to the Rummelsburgmarriage, and had addressed them all to you. I couldn't have made itsafer, could I?""I don't know what you mean.""You would have been enabled to destroy every scrap of the evidencewhich will be wanted to prove your brother's legitimacy. Had I burnedthe papers I could not have put them more beyond poor Mountjoy's reach.Now they are quite safe in Mr. Grey's office; his clerk took them awaywith him. I would not leave them here with Mountjoy because,--well,--youmight come, and he might be murdered!" Now Mr. Scarborough had had hisrevenge."You think you have done your duty," said Augustus."I do not care two straws about doing my duty, young man." Here Mr.Scarborough raised himself in part, and spoke in that strong voice whichwas supposed to be so deleterious to him. "Or rather, in seeking myduty, I look beyond the conventionalities of the world. I think that youhave behaved damnably, and that I have punished you. Because ofMountjoy's weakness, because he had been knocked off his legs, Iendeavored to put you upon yours. You at once turned upon me, when youthought the deed was done, and bade me go--and bury myself. You were alittle too quick in your desire to become the owner of Tretton Park atonce. I have stayed long enough to give some farther trouble. You willnot say, after this, that I am _non compos_, and unable to make a will.You will find that, under mine, not one penny-piece, not one scrap ofproperty, will become yours. Mountjoy will take care of you, I do notdoubt. He must hate you, but will recognize you as his brother. I am notso soft-hearted and will not recognize you as my son. Now you may goaway." So saying, he turned himself round to the wall, and refused to beinduced to utter another word. Augustus began to speak, but when he hadcommenced his second sentence the old man rung his bell. "Mary," said heto his sister, "will you have the goodness to get Augustus to go away? Iam very weak, and if he remains he will be the death of me. He can't getanything by killing me at once; it is too late for that."Then Augustus did leave the room, and before the night came had leftTretton also. He presumed there was nothing for him to do there. Oneword he did say to Mountjoy,--"You will understand, Mountjoy, that whenour father is dead Tretton will not become your property.""I shall understand nothing of the kind," said Mountjoy "but I supposeMr. Grey will tell me what I am to do."CHAPTER LVII.MR. PROSPER SHOWS HIS GOOD-NATURE.While these things were going on at Tretton, and while Mr. Scarboroughwas making all arrangements for the adequate disposition of hisproperty,--in doing which he had happily come to the conclusion thatthere was no necessity for interfering with what the law hadsettled,--Mr. Prosper was lying very ill at Buston, and was endeavoringon his sick-bed to reconcile himself to what the entail had done forhim. There could be no other heir to him but Harry Annesley. As hethought of the unmarried ladies of his acquaintance, he found that therewas no one who would have done for him but Miss Puffle and MatildaThoroughbung. All others were too young or too old, or chieflypenniless. Miss Puffle would have been the exact thing--only for thatintruding farmer's son.As he lay there alone in his bedroom his mind used to wander a little,and he would send for Matthew, his butler, and hold confidentialdiscussions with him. "I never did think, sir, that Miss Thoroughbungwas exactly the lady," said Matthew."Why not?""Well, sir, there is a saying--But you'll excuse me.""Go on, Matthew.""There is a saying as how 'you can't make a silk purse out of a sow'sear.'""I've heard that.""Just so, sir. Now, Miss Thoroughbung is a very nice lady.""I don't think she's a nice lady at all.""But--Of course it's not becoming in me to speak against my betters, andas a menial servant I never would.""Go on, Matthew.""Miss Thoroughbung is--""Go on, Matthew.""Well;--she is a sow's ear. Ain't she, now? The servants here neverwould have looked upon her as a silk purse.""Wouldn't they?""Never! She has a way with her just as though she didn't care for silkpurses. And it's my mind, sir, that she don't. She wishes, however, tobe uppermost, and if she had come here she'd have said so.""That can never be. Thank God, that can never be!""Oh, no! Brewers is brewers, and must be. There's Mr. Joe--He's verywell, no doubt.""I haven't the pleasure of his acquaintance.""Him as is to marry Miss Molly. But Miss Molly ain't the head of thefamily; is she, sir?" Here the squire shook his head. "You're the headof the family, sir.""I suppose so.""And is--I might make so bold as to speak?""Go on, Matthew.""Miss Thoroughbung would be a little out of place at Buston Hall. Now,as to Miss Puffle--""Miss Puffle is a lady,--or was.""No doubt, sir. The Puffles is not quite equal to the Prospers, as I canhear. But the Puffles is ladies--and gentlemen. The servants below allgive it up to them that they're real gentlefolk. But--""Well?""She demeaned herself terribly with young Tazlehurst. They all said asthere were more where that came from.""What should they mean by that?""She'd indulge in low 'abits,--such as never would have been put up withat Buston Hall,--a-cursing and a-swearing--""Miss Puffle!""Not herself,--I don't say that; but it's like enough if you 'ad heardall. But them as lets others do it almost does it themselves. And themas lets others drink sperrrits o' mornings come nigh to having a dramdown their own throats.""Oh laws!" exclaimed Mr. Prosper, thinking of the escape he had had."You wouldn't have liked it, sir, if there had been a bottle of gin inthe bedroom!" Here Mr. Prosper hid his face among the bedclothes. "Itain't all that comes silk out of the skein that does to make a purseof."There were difficulties in the pursuit of matrimony of which Mr. Prosperhad not thought. His imagination at once pictured to himself a bridewith a bottle of gin under her pillow, and he went on shivering tillMatthew almost thought that he had been attacked by an ague-fit."I shall give it up, at any rate," he said, after a pause."Of course you're a young man, sir.""No, I'm not.""That is, not exactly young,""You're an old fool to tell such lies!""Of course I'm an old fool; but I endeavor to be veracious. I neverdidn't take a shilling as were yours, nor a shilling's worth, all theyears I have known you, Mr. Prosper.""What has that to do with it? I'm not a young man.""What am I to say, sir? Shall I say as you are middle-aged?""The truth is, Matthew, I'm worn out.""Then I wouldn't think of taking a wife.""Troubles have been too heavy for me to bear. I don't think I wasintended to bear trouble.""'Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward,'" said Matthew."I suppose so. But one man's luck is harder than another's. They've beentoo many for me, and I feel that I'm sinking under them. It's no good mythinking of marrying now.""That's what I was coming to when you said I was an old fool. Of courseI am an old fool.""Do have done with it! Mr. Harry hasn't been exactly what he ought tohave been to me.""He's a very comely young gentleman.""What has comely to do with it?""Them as is plain-featured is more likely to stay at home and be quiet.You couldn't expect one as is so handsome to stay at Buston and hearsermons.""I don't expect him to be knocking men about in the streets atmidnight.""It ain't that, sir.""I say it is that!""Very well, sir. Only we've all heard down-stairs as Mr. Harry wasn'thim as struck the first blow. It was all about a young lady.""I know what it was about.""A young lady as is a young lady."--This was felt to the quick by Mr.Prosper, in regard to the gin-drinking Miss Puffle and the brewer-bredMiss Thoroughbung; but as he was beginning to think that thecontinuation of the family of the Prospers must depend on the marriagewhich Harry might make, he passed over the slur upon himself for thesake of the praise given to the future mother of the Prospers.--"Andwhen a young gentleman has set his heart on a young lady he's not goingto be braggydoshoed out of it.""Captain Scarborough knew her first.""First come first served isn't always the way with lovers. Mr. Harry wasthe conquering hero. 'Weni, widi, wici.'""Halloo, Matthew!""Them's the words as they say a young gentleman ought to use when he'sgot the better of a young lady's affections; and I dare say they're thevery words as put the captain into such a towering passion. I canunderstand how it happened, just as if I saw it.""But he went away, and left him bleeding and speechless.""He'd knocked his _weni, widi, wici_ out of him, I guess! I think, Mr.Prosper, you should forgive him." Mr. Prosper had thought so too, buthad hardly known how to express himself after his second burst of anger.But he was at the present ill and weak, and was anxious to have some onenear to him who should be more like a silk purse than his butler,Matthew. "Suppose you was to send for him, sir.""He wouldn't come.""Let him alone for coming! They tell me, sir--""Who tells you?""Why, sir, the servants now at the rectory. Of course, sir, where twofamilies is so near connected, the servants are just as near: it's nomore than natural. They tell me now that since you were so kind aboutthe allowance, their talk of you is all changed." Then the squire'sanger was heated hot again. Their talk had all been against him till hehad opened his hand in regard to the allowance. And now when there wassomething again to be got they could be civil. There was none of thatlove of him for himself for which an old man is always hankering,--forwhich the sick man breaks his heart,--but which the old and sick find itso difficult to get from the young and healthy. It is in nature that theold man should keep the purse in his own pocket, or otherwise he willhave so little to attract. He is weak, querulous, ugly to look at, aptto be greedy, cross, and untidy. Though he himself can love, what is hislove to any one? Duty demands that one shall smooth his pillow, and someone does smooth it,--as a duty. But the old man feels the difference, andremembers the time when there was one who was anxious to share it.Mr. Prosper was not in years an old man, and had not as yet passed thattime of life at which many a man is regarded by his children as the bestof their playfellows. But he was weak in body, self-conscious, andjealous in spirit. He had the heart to lay out for himself a generousline of conduct, but not the purpose to stick to it steadily. His nephewhad ever been a trouble to him, because he had expected from his nephewa kind of worship to which he had felt that he was entitled as the headof the family. All good things were to come from him, and therefore goodthings should be given to him. Harry had told himself that his uncle wasnot his father, and that it had not been his fault that he was hisuncle's heir. He had not asked his uncle for an allowance. He had grownup with the feeling that Buston Hall was to be his own, and had notregarded his uncle as the donor. His father, with his large family, hadnever exacted much,--had wanted no special attention from him. And if nothis father, then why his uncle? But his inattention, his absence ofgratitude for peculiar gifts, had sunk deep into Mr. Prosper's bosom.Hence had come Miss Thoroughbung as his last resource, and MissThoroughbung had--called him Peter. Hence his mind had wandered to MissPuffle, and Miss Puffle had gone off with the farmer's son, and, as hewas now informed, had taken to drinking gin. Therefore he turned hisface to the wall and prepared himself to die.On the next day he sent for Matthew again. Matthew first came to himalways in the morning, but on that occasion very little conversationever took place. In the middle of the day he had a bowl of soup broughtto him, and by that time had managed to drag himself out of bed, and toclothe himself in his dressing-gown, and to seat himself in hisarm-chair. Then when the soup had been slowly eaten, he would ring hisbell, and the conversation would begin. "I have been thinking over whatI was saying yesterday, Matthew." Matthew simply assented, but he knewin his heart that his master had been thinking over what he himself hadsaid."Is Mr. Harry at the rectory?""Oh yes; he's there now. He wouldn't stir from the rectory till he hearsthat you are better.""Why shouldn't he stir? Does he mean to say that I'm going to die?Perhaps I am. I'm very weak, but he doesn't know it."Matthew felt that he had made a blunder, and that he must get out of itas well as he could. "It isn't that he is thinking anything of that, butyou are confined to your room, sir. Of course he knows that.""I never told him.""He's most particular in his inquiries from day to day.""Does he come here?""He don't venture on that, because he knows as how you wouldn't wishit.""Why shouldn't I wish it? It'd be the most natural thing in the world.""But there has been--a little--I'm quite sure Mr. Harry don't wish tointrude. If you'd let me give it to be understood that you'd like him tocall, he'd be over here in a jiffy." Then, very slowly, Mr. Prosper didgive it to be understood that he would take it as a compliment if hisnephew would walk across the park and ask after him. He was mostparticular as to the mode in which this embassy should be conducted.Harry was not to be made to think that he was to come rushing into thehouse after his old fashion,--"Halloo, uncle, aren't you well? Hopeyou'll be better when I come back. Have got to be off by the nexttrain." Then he used to fly away and not be heard of again for a week.And yet the message was to be conveyed with an alluring courtesy thatmight be attractive, and might indicate that no hostility was intended.But it was not to be a positive message, but one which would signifywhat might possibly take place. If it should happen that Mr. Harry waswalking in this direction, it might also happen that his uncle would bepleased to see him. There was no better ambassador at hand than Matthew,and therefore Matthew was commissioned to arrange matters. "If you canget at Mrs. Weeks, and do it through his mother," suggested Mr. Prosper.Then Matthew winked and departed on his errand.In about two hours there was a ring at the back-door, of which Mr.Prosper knew well the sound. Miss Thoroughbung had not been there veryoften, but he had learned to distinguish her ring or her servant's. Inold days, not so very far removed, Harry had never been accustomed toring at all. But yet his uncle knew that it was he, and not the doctor,who might probably come,--or Mr. Soames, of whose coming he lived inhourly dread. "You can show him up," he said to Matthew, opening thedoor with great exertion, and attempting to speak to the servant downthe stairs. Harry, at any rate, was shown up, and in two minutes' timewas standing over his uncle's sick-chair. "I have not been quite welljust lately," he said, in answer to the inquiries made."We are very sorry to hear that, sir.""I suppose you've heard it before.""We did hear that you were a little out of sorts.""Out of sorts! I don't know what you call out of sorts. I have not beenout of this room for well-nigh a month. My sister came to see me oneday, and that's the last Christian I've seen.""My mother would be over daily if she fancied you'd like it.""She has her own duties, and I don't want to be troublesome.""The truth is, Uncle Prosper, that we have all felt that we have been inyour black books; and as we have not thought that we deserved it, therehas been a little coolness.""I told your mother that I was willing to forgive you.""Forgive me what? A fellow does not care to be forgiven when he has donenothing. But if you'll only say that by-gones shall be by-gones quitepast I'll take it so." He could not give up his position as head of thefamily so easily,--an injured head of the family. And yet he was anxiousthat by-gones should be by-gones, if only the young man would not be sojaunty, as he stood there by his arm-chair. "Just say the word, and thegirls shall come up and see you as they used to do." Mr. Prosper thoughtat the moment that one of the girls was going to marry Joe Thoroughbung,and that he would not wish to see her. "As for myself, if I've been inany way negligent, I can only say that I did not intend it. I do notlike to say more, because it would seem as though I were asking you formoney.""I don't know why you shouldn't ask me.""A man doesn't like to do that. But I'd tell you of everything if you'donly let me.""What is there to tell?" said Uncle Prosper, knowing well that thelove-story would be communicated to him."I've got myself engaged to marry a young woman.""A young woman!""Yes;--she's a young woman, of course; but she's a young lady as well.You know her name: it is Florence Mountjoy.""That is the young lady that I've heard of. Was there not some othergentleman attached to her?""There was;--her cousin, Mountjoy Scarborough.""His father wrote to me.""His father is the meanest fellow I ever met.""And he himself came to me,--down here. They were fighting your battlefor you.""I'm much obliged to them.""For even I have interfered with him about the lady."Then Harry had to repeat his _veni, vidi, vici_ after his own fashion."Of course I interfered with him. How is a fellow to help himself? Weboth of us were spooning on the same girl, and of course she had todecide it.""And she decided for you?""I fancy she did. At any rate I decided for her, and I mean to haveher."Then Mr. Prosper was, for him, very gracious in his congratulations,saying all manner of good things of Miss Mountjoy. "I think you'd likeher, Uncle Prosper." Mr. Prosper did not doubt but that he would"appease the solicitor." He also had heard of Miss Mountjoy, and what hehad heard had been much to the "young lady's credit." Then he asked afew questions as to the time fixed for the marriage. Here Harry wasobliged to own that there were difficulties. Miss Mountjoy had promisednot to marry for three years without her mother's consent. "Threeyears!" said Mr. Prosper. "Then I shall be dead and buried." Harry didnot tell his uncle that in that case the difficulty might probablyvanish, as the same degree of fate which had robbed him of his pooruncle would have made him owner of Buston. In such a case as that Mrs.Mountjoy might probably give way."But why is the young lady to be kept from marriage for three years?Does she wish it?"Harry said that he did not exactly think that Miss Mountjoy, on her ownbehalf, did wish for so prolonged a separation. "The fact is, sir, thatMrs. Mountjoy is not my best friend. This nephew of hers, MountjoyScarborough, has always been her favorite.""But he's a man that always loses his money at cards.""He's to have all Tretton now, it seems.""And what does the young lady say?""All Tretton won't move her. I'm not a bit afraid. I've got her word,and that's enough for me. How it is that her mother should think itpossible;--that's what I do not know.""The three years are quite fixed?""I don't quite say that altogether.""But a young lady who will be true to you will be true to her motheralso." Harry shook his head. He was quite willing to guaranteeFlorence's truth as to her promise to him, but he did not think that herpromise to her mother need be put on the same footing. "I shall be veryglad if you can arrange it any other way. Three years is a long time.""Quite absurd, you know," said Harry, with energy."What made her fix on three years?""I don't know how they did it between them. Mrs. Mountjoy, perhaps,thought that it might give time to her nephew. Ten years would be thesame as far as he is concerned. Florence is a girl who, when she saysthat she loves a man, means it. For you don't suppose I intend to remainthree years?""What do you intend to do?""One has to wait a little and see." Then there was a long pause, duringwhich Harry stood twiddling his fingers. He had nothing farther tosuggest, but he thought that his uncle might say something. "Shall Icome again to-morrow, Uncle Prosper?" he said."I have got a plan," said Uncle Prosper."What is it, uncle?""I don't know that it can lead to anything. It's of no use, of course,if the young lady will wait the three years.""I don't think she's at all anxious," said Harry."You might marry almost at once.""That's what I should like.""And come and live here.""In this house?""Why not? I'm nobody. You'd soon find that I'm nobody.""That's nonsense, Uncle Prosper. Of course you're everybody in your ownhouse.""You might endure it for six months in the year."Harry thought of the sermons, but resolved at once to face them boldly."I am only thinking how generous you are.""It's what I mean. I don't know the young lady, and perhaps she mightn'tlike living with an old gentleman. In regard to the other six months,I'll raise the two hundred and fifty pounds to five hundred pounds. Ifshe thinks well of it, she should come here first and let me see her.She and her mother might both come." Then there was a pause. "I shouldnot know how to bear it,--I should not, indeed. But let them both come."After some farther delay this was at last decided on. Harry went awaysupremely happy and very grateful, and Mr. Prosper was left to meditateon the terrible step he had taken.CHAPTER LVIII.MR. SCARBOROUGH'S DEATH.It is a melancholy fact that Mr. Barry, when he heard the last storyfrom Tretton, began to think that his partner was not so wide-awake ashe had hitherto always regarded him. As time runs on, such a resultgenerally takes place in all close connections between the old and theyoung. Ten years ago Mr. Barry had looked up to Mr. Grey with a trustfulrespect. Words which fell from Mr. Grey were certainly words of truth,but they were, in Mr. Barry's then estimation, words of wisdom also.Gradually an altered feeling had grown up; and Mr. Barry, though he didnot doubt the truth, thought less about it. But he did doubt the wisdomconstantly. The wisdom practised under Mr. Barry's vice-management wasnot quite the same as Mr. Grey's. And Mr. Barry had come to understandthat though it might be well to tell the truth on occasions, it wasfolly to suppose that any one else would do so. He had always thoughtthat Mr. Grey had gone a little too fast in believing SquireScarborough's first story. "But you've been to Nice, yourself, anddiscovered that it is true," Mr. Grey would say. Mr. Barry would shakehis head, and declare that in having to deal with a man of such variedintellect as Mr. Scarborough there was no coming at the bottom of astory.But there had been no question of any alterations in the mode ofconducting the business of the firm. Mr. Grey had been, of course, thepartner by whose judgment any question of importance must ultimately bedecided; and, though Mr. Barry had been sent to Nice, the Scarboroughproperty was especially in Mr. Grey's branch. He had been loud indeclaring the iniquity of his client, but had altogether made up hismind that the iniquity had been practised; and all the clerks in theoffice had gone with him, trusting to his great character for sobersagacity. And Mr. Grey was not a man who would easily be put out of hishigh position.The respect generally felt for him was too high; and he carried himselfbefore his partner and clerks too powerfully to lose at once hisprestige. But Mr. Barry, when he heard the new story, looked at his ownfavorite clerk and almost winked an eye; and when he came to discuss thematter with Mr. Grey, he declined even to pretend to be led at once byMr. Grey's opinion. "A gentleman who has been so very clever on oneoccasion may be very clever on another." That had been his argument. Mr.Grey's reply had simply been to the effect that you cannot twice catchan old bird with chaff. Mr. Barry seemed, however, to think, indiscussing the matter with the favorite clerk, that the older the birdbecame, the more often he could be caught with chaff.Mr. Grey in these days was very unhappy,--not made so simply by theiniquity of his client, but by the insight which he got into hispartner's aptitude for business. He began to have his doubts about Mr.Barry. Mr. Barry was tending toward sharp practice. Mr. Barry wasbeginning to love his clients,--not with a proper attorney's affection,as his children, but as sheep to be shorn. With Mr. Grey the bills hadgone out and had been paid, no doubt, and the money had in some shapefound its way into Mr. Grey's pockets. But he had never looked at thetwo things together. Mr. Barry seemed to be thinking of the wool asevery client came or was dismissed. Mr. Grey, as he thought of thesethings, began to fancy that his own style of business was becomingantiquated. He had said good words of Mr. Barry to his daughter, butjust at this period his faith both in himself and in his partner beganto fail. His partner was becoming too strong for him, and he felt thathe was failing. Things were changed; and he did not love his business ashe used to do. He had fancies, and he knew that he had fancies, and thatfancies were not good for an attorney. When he saw what was in Mr.Barry's mind as to this new story from Tretton, he became convinced thatDolly was right. Dolly was not fit, he thought, to be Mr. Barry's wife.She might have been the wife of such another as himself, had the partnerbeen such another. But it was not probable that any partner should havebeen such as he was. "Old times are changed," he said to himself; "oldmanners gone." Then he determined that he would put his house in order,and leave the firm. A man cannot leave his work forever without sometouch of melancholy.But it was necessary that some one should go to Rummelsburg and findwhat could be learned there. Mr. Grey had sworn that he would havenothing to do with the new story, as soon as the new story had been toldto him; but it soon became apparent to him that he must have to do withit. As soon as the breath should be out of the old squire's body, someone must take possession of Tretton, and Mountjoy would be left in thehouse. In accordance with Mr. Grey's theory, Augustus would be theproper possessor. Augustus, no doubt, would go down and claim theownership, unless the matter could be decided to the satisfaction ofthem both beforehand. Mr. Grey thought that there was little hope ofsuch satisfaction; but it would of course be for him or his firm to seewhat could be done. "That I should ever have got such a piece ofbusiness!" he said to himself. But it was at last settled among themthat Mr. Barry should go to Rummelsburg. He had made the inquiry atNice, and he would go on with it at Rummelsburg. Mr. Barry started, withMr. Quaverdale, of St. John's, the gentleman whom Harry Annesley hadconsulted as to the practicability of his earning money by writing forthe Press. Mr. Quaverdale was supposed to be a German scholar, andtherefore had his expenses paid for him, with some bonus for his time.A conversation between Mr. Barry and Mr. Quaverdale, which took place ontheir way home, shall be given, as it will best describe the result oftheir inquiry. This inquiry had been conducted by Mr. Barry'sintelligence, but had owed so much to Mr. Quaverdale's extensiveknowledge of languages, that the two gentlemen may be said, as they camehome, to be equally well instructed in the affairs of Mr. Scarborough'sproperty."He has been too many for the governor," said Barry. Mr. Barry'sgovernor was Mr. Grey."It seems to me that Scarborough is a gentleman who is apt to be toomany for most men.""The sharpest fellow I ever came across, either in the way of a cheat orin any other walk of life. If he wanted any one else to have theproperty, he'd come out with something to show that the entail itselfwas all moonshine.""But when he married again at Nice, he couldn't have quarrelled with hiseldest son already. The child was not above four or five months old."This came from Quaverdale."It's my impression," said Barry, "that it was then his intention todivide the property, and that this was done as a kind of protest againstprimogeniture. Then he found that that would fail,--that if he came toexplain the whole matter to his sons, they would not consent to beguided by him, and to accept a division. From what I have seen of bothof them, they are bad to guide after that fashion. Then Mountjoy gotfrightfully into the hands of the money-lenders, and in order to do themit became necessary that the whole property should go to Augustus.""They must look upon him as a nice sort of old man!" said Quaverdale."Rather! But they have never got at him to speak a bit of their mind tohim. And then how clever he was in getting round his own younger son.The property got into such a condition that there was money enough topay the Jews the money they had really lent. Augustus, who was neverquite sure of his father, thought it would be best to disarm them; andhe consented to pay them, getting back all their bonds. But he was veryuncivil to the squire,--told him that the sooner he died the better, orsomething of that sort; and then the squire immediately turned round andsprung this Rummelsburg marriage upon us, and has left every stick aboutthe place to Mountjoy. It must all go to Mountjoy,--every acre, everyhorse, every bed, and every book.""And these, in twelve months' time, will have been divided among thecard-players of the metropolis," said Quaverdale."We've got nothing to do with that. If ever a man did have a lesson hehas had it. If he chose to take it, no man would ever have been saved inso miraculous a manner. But there can be no doubt that John Scarboroughand Ada Sneyd were married at Rummelsburg, and that it will be found tobe impossible to unmarry them.""Old Mrs. Sneyd, the lady's mother, was then present?" said Quaverdale."Not a doubt about it, and that Fritz Deutchmann was present at themarriage. I almost think that we ought to have brought him away with us.It would have cost a couple of hundred pounds, but the estate can bearthat. We can have him by sending for him, if we should want it." Then,after many more words on the same subject and to the same effect, Mr.Barry went on to give his own private opinions: "In fact, the onlyblemish in old Scarborough's plans was this,--that the Rummelsburgmarriage was sure to come out sooner or later.""Do you think so? Fritz Deutchmann is the only one of the party alive,and it's not probable that he would ever have heard of Tretton.""These things always do come out. But it does not signify now. And theworld will know how godless and reprobate old Scarborough has been; butthat will not interfere with Mountjoy's legitimacy. And the world haspretty well understood already that the old man has cared nothing forGod or man. It was bad enough, according to the other story, that heshould have kept Augustus so long in the dark, and determined to give itall to a bastard by means of a plot and a fraud. The world has got usedto that. The world will simply be amused by this other turn. And as theworld generally is not very fond of Augustus Scarborough, and entertainsa sort of a good-natured pity for Mountjoy, the first marriage will beeasily accepted.""There'll be a lawsuit, I suppose?" said Quaverdale."I don't see that they'll have a leg to stand on. When the old man diesthe property will be exactly as it would have been. This latter intendedfraud in favor of Augustus will be understood as having been oldScarborough's farce. The Jews are the party who have really suffered.""And Augustus?""He will have lost nothing to which he was by law entitled. His fathermight of course make what will he pleased. If Augustus was uncivil tohis father, his father could of course alter his will. The world wouldsee all that. But the world will be inclined to say that these poormoney-lenders have been awfully swindled.""The world won't pity them.""I'm not so sure. It's a hard case to get hold of a lot of men and forcethem to lend you a hundred pounds without security and without interest.That's what has been done in this case.""They'll have no means of recovering anything.""Not a shilling. The wonder is that they should have got three hundredthousand pounds. They never would have had it unless the squire hadwished to pave the way back for Mountjoy. And then he made Augustus doit for him! In my mind he has been so clever that he ought to beforgiven all his rascality. There has been, too, no punishment for him,and no probability of punishment. He has done nothing for which the lawcan touch him. He has proposed to cheat people, but before he would havecheated them he might be dead. The money-lenders will have been swindledawfully, but they have never had any ground of tangible complaintagainst him. 'Who are you?' he has said. 'I don't know you.' Theyalleged that they had lent their money to his eldest son. 'That's as youthought,' he replied. 'I ain't bound to come and tell you all the familyarrangements about my marriage.' If you look at it all round it wasuncommonly well done."When Mr. Barry got back he found that it was generally admitted at theChambers that the business had been well done. Everybody was preparedto allow that Mr. Scarborough had not left a screw loose in thearrangement,--though he was this moment on his death-bed, and had beenunder surgical tortures and operations, and, in fact, slowly dying,during the whole period that he had been thus busy. Every one concernedin the matter seemed to admire Mr. Scarborough except Mr. Grey, whoseanger, either with himself or his client, became the stronger the loudergrew the admiration of the world.A couple of barristers very learned in the law were consulted, and theygave it as their opinion that from the evidence as shown to them therecould be no doubt but that Mountjoy was legitimate. There was no reasonin the least for doubting it, but for that strange episode which hadoccurred when, in order to get the better of the law, Mr. Scarboroughhad declared that at the time of Mountjoy's birth he had not beenmarried. They went on to declare that on the squire's death theRummelsburg marriage must of course have been discovered, and had givenit as their opinion that the squire had never dreamed of doing so greatan injustice either to his elder or his younger son. He had simplydesired, as they thought, to cheat the money-lenders, and had cheatedthem beautifully. That Mr. Tyrrwhit should have been so very soft was amarvel to them; but it only showed how very foolish a sharp man of theworld might be when he encountered one sharper.And Augustus, through an attorney acting on his own behalf, consultedtwo other barristers, whose joint opinion was not forthcoming quite atonce, but may have to be stated. Augustus was declared by them to havereceived at his father's hands a most irreparable injury to such anextent that an action for damages would, in their opinion, lie.He had, by accepting his father's first story, altered the whole courseof his life, abandoned his profession, and even paid large sums of moneyout of his own pocket for the maintenance of his elder brother. A jurywould probably award him some very considerable sum,--if a jury could gethold of his father while still living. No doubt the furniture and otherproperty would remain, and might be held to be liable for the presentowner's laches. But these two learned lawyers did not think that anaction could be taken with any probability of success against the eldestson, with reference to his tables and chairs, when the Tretton estatesshould have become his. As these learned lawyers had learned that oldMr. Scarborough was at this moment almost _in articulo mortis_, wouldit not be better that Augustus should apply to his elder brother to makehim such compensation as the peculiarities of the case would demand? Butas this opinion did not reach Augustus till his father was dead, thefirst alternative proposed was of no use."I suppose, sir, we had better communicate with Mr. Scarborough?" Mr.Barry said to his partner, on his return."Not in my name," Mr. Grey replied. "I've put Mr. Scarborough in such astate that he is not allowed to see any business letter. Sir WilliamBrodrick is there now." But communications were made both to Mountjoyand to Augustus. There was nothing for Mountjoy to do; his case was inMr. Barry's hands; nor could he take any steps till something should bedone to oust him from Tretton. Augustus, however, immediately went towork and employed his counsel, learned in the law."You will do something, I suppose, for poor Gus?" the old man said tohis son one morning. It was the last morning on which he was destined toawake in the world, and he had been told by Sir William and by Mr.Merton that it would probably be so. But death to him had no terror.Life to him, for many weeks past, had been so laden with pain as to makehim look forward to a release from it with hope. But the business oflife had pressed so hard upon him as to make him feel that he could nottell what had been accomplished.The adjustment of such a property as Tretton required, he thought, hispresence, and, till it had been adjusted, he clung to life with apertinacity which had seemed to be oppressive. Now Mountjoy's debts hadbeen paid, and Mountjoy could be left a bit happier. Having achieved somuch, he was delighted to think that he might. But there had comelatterly a claim upon him equally strong,--that he should wreak hisvengeance upon Augustus. Had Augustus abused him for keeping him in thedark so long, he would have borne it patiently. He had expected as much.But his son had ridiculed him, laughed at him, made nothing of him, andhad at last told him to die out of the way. He would, at any rate, dosomething before he died.He had had his revenge, very bitter of its kind. Augustus should be madeto feel that he had not been ridiculous,--not to be laughed at in hislast days. He had ruined his son, inevitably ruined him, and was about toleave him penniless upon the earth. But now in his last moments, in hisvery last, there came upon him some feeling of pity, and in speaking ofhis son he once more called him "Gus.""I don't know how it will all be, sir; but if the property is to bemine--""It will be yours; it must be yours.""Then I will do anything for him that he will accept.""Do not let him starve, or have to earn his bread.""Say what you wish, sir, and it shall be done, as far as I can do it.""Make an offer to him of some income, and settle it on him. Do it atonce." The old man, as he said this, was thinking probably of the greatdanger that all Tretton might, before long, have been made to vanish."And, Mountjoy--""Sir.""You have gambled surely enough for amusement. With such a property asthis in your hands gambling becomes very serious."They were the last words,--the last intelligible words,--which the old manspoke. He died with his left hand on his son's neck, and took Merton andhis sister by his side. It was a death-bed not without its lesson,--notwithout a certain charm in the eyes of some fancied beholder. Those whowere there seemed to love him well, and should do so.He had contrived, in spite of his great faults, to create a respect inthe minds of those around him, which is itself a great element of love.But there was something in his manner which told of love for others. Hewas one who could hate to distraction, and on whom no bonds of bloodwould operate to mitigate his hatred. He would persevere to injure witha terrible persistency; but yet in every phase of his life he had beenactuated by love for others. He had never been selfish, thinking alwaysof others rather than of himself. Supremely indifferent he had been tothe opinion of the world around him, but he had never run counter to hisown conscience. For the conventionalities of the law he entertained asupreme contempt, but he did wish so to arrange matters with which hewas himself concerned as to do what justice demanded. Whether hesucceeded in the last year of his life the reader may judge. Butcertainly the three persons who were assembled around his death-bed didrespect him, and had been made to love him by what he had done.Merton wrote the next morning to his friend Henry Annesley respectingthe scene. "The poor old boy has gone at last, and, in spite of all hisfaults, I feel as though I had lost an old friend. To me he has beenmost kind, and did I not know of all his sins I should say that he hadbeen always loyal and always charitable. Mr. Grey condemns him, and allthe world must condemn him. One cannot make an apology for him withoutbeing ready to throw all truth and all morality to the dogs. But if youcan imagine for yourself a state of things in which neither truth normorality shall be thought essential, then old Mr. Scarborough would beyour hero. He was the bravest man I ever knew. He was ready to look allopposition in the face, and prepared to bear it down. And whatever hedid, he did with the view of accomplishing what he thought to be rightfor other people. Between him and his God I cannot judge, but hebelieved in an Almighty One, and certainly went forth to meet himwithout a fear in his heart."CHAPTER LIX.JOE THOROUGHBUNG'S WEDDING.While some men die others are marrying. While the funeral dirge waspealing sadly at Tretton, the joyful marriage-bells were ringing both atBuntingford and Buston. Joe Thoroughbung, dressed all in his best, wasabout to carry off Molly Annesley to Rome previous to settling down to acomfortable life of hunting and brewing in his native town. MissThoroughbung sent her compliments to Mrs. Annesley. Would her brother bethere? She thought it probable that Mr. Prosper would not be glad to seeher. She longed to substitute "Peter" for Mr. Prosper, but abstained. Insuch case she would deny herself the pleasure of "seeing Joe turnedoff." Then there was an embassy sent to the Hall. The two younger girlswent with the object of inviting Uncle Prosper, but with a desire attheir hearts that Uncle Prosper might not come. "I presume the family atBuntingford will be represented?" Uncle Prosper had asked. "Somebodywill come, I suppose," said Fanny. Then Uncle Prosper had sent down apretty jewelled ring, and said that he would remain in his room. Hishealth hardly permitted of his being present with advantage. So it wasdecided that Miss Thoroughbung should come, and every one felt that shewould be the howling spirit,--if not at the ceremony, at the banquetwhich would be given afterward.Miss Thoroughbung was not the only obstacle, had the whole been known.Young Soames, the son of the attorney with whom Mr. Prosper had found itso evil a thing to have to deal, was to act as Joe's best man. Mr.Prosper learned this, probably, from Matthew, but he never spoke of itto the family.It was a sad disgrace in his eyes that any Soames should have been sofar mixed up with the Prosper blood. Young Algy Soames was in himself avery nice sort of young fellow, who liked a day's hunting when he couldbe spared out of his father's office, and whose worst fault was that hewore loud cravats. But he was an abomination to Mr. Prosper, who hadnever seen him. As it was, he carried himself very mildly on thisoccasion."It's a pity we're not to have two marriages at the same time," said Mr.Crabtree, a clerical wag from the next parish. "Don't you think so, Mrs.Annesley?" Mrs. Annesley was standing close by, as was also MissThoroughbung, but she made no answer to the appeal. People whounderstood anything knew that Mrs. Annesley would not be gratified bysuch an allusion. But Mr. Crabtree was a man who understood nothing."The old birds never pair so readily as the young ones," said MissThoroughbung."Old! Who talks of being old?" said Mr. Crabtree. "My friend Prosper isquite a boy. There's a good time coming, and I hope you'll give way yet,Miss Thoroughbung."Then they were all marshalled on their way to church. It is quite out ofmy power to describe the bride's dress, or that of the bride's maids.They were the bride's sisters and two of Joe's sisters. An attempt hadbeen made to induce Florence Mountjoy to come down, but it had beenunsuccessful. Things had gone so far now at Cheltenham that Mrs.Mountjoy had been driven to acknowledge that if Florence held to herproject for three years she should be allowed to marry Harry Annesley.But she had accompanied this permission by many absurd restrictions.Florence was not to see him, at any rate, during the first year; but shewas to see Mountjoy Scarborough if he came to Cheltenham. Florencedeclared this to be impossible; but, as the Buston marriage took placejust at this moment, she could not have her way in everything. Joe droveup to the church with Algy Soames, it not having been thought discreetthat he should enter the parsonage on that morning, though he had beenthere nearly every day through the winter. "I declare, here he is!"said Miss Thoroughbung, very loudly. "I never thought he'd have thecourage at the last moment.""I wonder how a certain gentleman would have felt when it came to hislast moment," said Mr. Crabtree.Mrs. Annesley took to weeping bitterly, which seemed to be unnecessary,as she had done nothing but congratulate herself since the match hadfirst been made, and had rejoiced greatly that one of her numerous broodshould have "put into such a haven of rest.""My dear Mrs. Annesley," said Mrs. Crabtree, consoling her in that shewould not be far removed from her child, "you can almost see the brewerychimneys from the church tower." Those who knew the two ladies well wereaware that there was some little slur intended by the allusion tobrewery chimneys. Mrs. Crabtree's girl had married the third son of SirReginald Rattlepate. The Rattlepates were not rich, and the third sonwas not inclined to earn his bread."Thank God, yes!" said Mrs. Annesley, through her tears. "Whenever Ishall see them I shall know that there's an income coming out with thesmoke."The boys were home from school for the occasion. "Molly, there's Joecoming after you," said the elder."If he gives you a kiss now you needn't pretend to mind," said theother."My darling, my own one, that so soon will be my own no longer!" saidthe father, as he made his way into the vestry to put on his surplice."Dear papa!" It was the only word the bride said as she walked in at thechurch-door, and prepared to make her way up the nave at the head of herlittle bevy. They were all very bright, as they stood there before thealtar, but the brightest spot among them was Algy Soames's blue necktie.Joe for the moment was much depressed, and thought nothing of the lastrun in which he had distinguished himself; but nevertheless he held uphis head well as a man and a brewer."Dont'ee take on so," Miss Thoroughbung said to Mrs. Annesley at thelast moment. "He'll give her plenty to eat and to drink, and will neverdo her a morsel of harm." Joe overheard this, and wished that his auntwas back in her bed at Marmaduke Lodge.Then the marriage was over, and they all trooped into the vestry to signthe book. "You can't get out of that now," said Mrs. Crabtree to Joe."I don't want to. I have got the fairest girl in these parts for mywife, and, as I believe, the best young woman." This he said with aspirit for which Mrs. Crabtree had not given him credit, and Algy Soamesheard him and admired his friend beneath his blue necktie. And one ofthe girls heard it, and cried tears of joy as she told her sisterafterward in the bedroom. "Oh, what a darling he is!" Molly had said,amid her own sobbing. Joe stood an inch higher among them all because ofthat word.Then came the breakfast,--that dullest, saddest hour of all. To feedheavily about twelve in the morning is always a nuisance,--a nuisance soabominable that it should be avoided under any other circumstances thana wedding in your own family. But that wedding-breakfast, when it doescome, is the worst of all feeding. The smart dresses and bare shouldersseen there by daylight, the handing people in and out among the seats,the very nature of the food, made up of chicken and sweets and flummery,the profusion of champagne, not sometimes of the very best on such anoccasion; and then the speeches! They fall generally to the lot of somemiddle-aged gentlemen, who seem always to have been selected for theirincapacity. But there is a worse trouble yet remaining--in the unnaturalrepletion which the sight even of so much food produces, and the factthat your dinner for that day is destroyed utterly and forever.Mr. Crabtree and the two fathers made the speeches, over and beyond thatwhich was made by Joe himself. Joe's father was not eloquent. He brewed,no doubt, good beer, without a taste in it beyond malt and hops;--no manin the county brewed better beer; but he couldn't make a speech. He gotup, dressed in a big white waistcoat, and a face as red as his son'shunting-coat, and said that he hoped his boy would make a good husband.All he could say was, that being a lover had not helped to make him agood brewer. Perhaps when Molly Annesley was brought nearer toBuntingford, Joe mightn't spend so much of his time in going to and fro.Perhaps Mr. Joe might not demand so much of her attention. This was thegreat point he made, and it was received well by all but the bride, whowhispered to Joe that if he thought that he was to be among the brewingtubs from morning till night he'd find he was mistaken. Mr. Annesleythrew a word or two of feeling into his speech, as is usual with thefather of the young lady, but nobody seemed to care much for that. Mr.Crabtree was facetious with the ordinary wedding jests,--as might havebeen expected, seeing that he had been present at every wedding in thecounty for the last twenty years. The elderly ladies laughedgood-humoredly, and Mrs. Crabtree was heard to say that the wholeaffair would have been very tame but that Mr. Crabtree had "carried itall off." But, in truth, when Joe got up the fun of the day hadcommenced, for Miss Thoroughbung, though she kept her chair, was able toutter as many words as her nephew: "I'm sure I'm very much obliged toyou for what you've all been saying.""So you ought, sir, for you have heard more good of yourself than you'llever hear again.""Then I'm the more obliged to you. What my people have said about mybeing so long upon the road--""That's only just what you have told them at the brewery. Nobody knowswhere you have been.""Molly can tell you all about that.""I can't tell them anything," Molly said in a whisper."But it comes only once in a man's lifetime," continued Joe; "and I daresay, if we knew all about the governor when he was of my age, which Idon't remember, he was as spooney as any one.""I only saw him once for six months before he was married," said Mrs.Thoroughbung in a funereal voice."He's made up for it since," said Miss Thoroughbung."I'm sure I'm very proud to have got such a young lady to have come andjoined her lot with mine," continued Joe; "and nobody can think moreabout his wife's family than I do.""And all Buston," said the aunt."Yes, and all Buston.""I'm sure we're all sorry that the bride's uncle, from Buston Hall, hasnot been able to come here to-day. You ought to say that, Joe.""Yes, I do say it. I'm very sorry that Mr. Prosper isn't able to behere.""Perhaps Miss Thoroughbung can tell us something about him?" said Mr.Crabtree."Me! I know nothing special. When I saw him last he was in good health.I did nothing to him to make him keep his bed. Mrs. Crabtree seems tothink that I have got your uncle in my keeping. Molly, I beg to say thatI'm not responsible."It must be allowed that amid such free conversation it was difficult forJoe to shine as an orator. But as he had no such ambition, perhaps theinterruptions only served him. But Miss Thoroughbung's witticism didthrow a certain damp over the wedding-breakfast. It was perhaps to havebeen expected that the lady should take her revenge for the injury doneto her. It was the only revenge that she did take. She had beenill-used, she thought, and yet she had not put Mr. Prosper to a shillingof expense. And there was present to her a feeling that the uncle had atthe last moment been debarred from complying with her small requests infavor of Miss Tickle and the ponies on behalf of the young man who wasnow sitting opposite to her, and that the good things coming from BustonHall were to be made to flow in the way of the Annesleys generallyrather than in her way. She did not regret them very much, and it wasnot in her nature to be bitter; but still all those little touches aboutMr. Prosper were pleasant to her, and were, of course, unpleasant to theAnnesleys. Then, it will be said, she should not have come to partake ofa breakfast in Mr. Annesley's dining-room. That is a matter of taste,and perhaps Miss Thoroughbung's taste was not altogether refined.Joe's speech came to an end, and with it his aunt's remarks. But as sheleft the room she said a few words to Mr. Annesley. "Don't suppose thatI am angry,--not in the least; certainly not with you or Harry. I'd dohim a good turn to-morrow if I could; and so, for the matter of that, Iwould to his uncle. But you can't expect but what a woman should haveher feelings and express them." Mr. Annesley, on the other hand, thoughtit strange that a woman in such a position should express her feelings.Then at last came the departure. Molly was taken up into her mother'sroom and cried over for the last time. "I know that I'm an old fool!""Oh, mamma! now, dearest mamma!""A good husband is the greatest blessing that God can send a girl, and Ido think that he is good and sterling.""He is, mamma,--he is. I know he is.""And when that woman talks about brewery chimneys, I know what a comfortit is that there should be chimneys, and that they should be near.Brewery chimneys are better than a do-nothing scamp that can't earn ameal for himself or his children. And when I see Joe with his pink coaton going to the meet, I thank God that my Molly has got a lad that canwork hard, and ride his own horses, and go out hunting with the best ofthem.""Oh, mamma, I do like to see him then. He is handsome.""I would not have anything altered. But--but--Oh, my child, you aregoing away!""As Mrs. Crabtree says, I sha'n't be far.""No, no! But you won't be all mine. The time will come when you'llthink of your girls in the same way. You haven't done a thing that Ihaven't seen and known and pondered over; you haven't worn a skirt butwhat it has been dear to me; you haven't uttered a prayer but what Ihave heard it as it went up to God's throne. I hope he says hisprayers.""I'm sure he does," said Molly, with confidence more or less wellfounded."Now go, and leave me here. I'm such an old stupid that I can't helpcrying; and if that woman was to say anything more to me about thechimneys I should give her a bit of my mind."Then Molly went down with her travelling-hat on, looking twice prettierthan she had done during the whole of the morning ceremonies. It is, Isuppose, on the bridegroom's behalf that the bride is put forth in allher best looks just as she is about to become, for the first time,exclusively his own. Molly, on the present occasion, was very pretty,and Joe was very proud. It was not the least of his pride that he,feeling himself to be not quite as yet removed from the "Bung" to the"Thorough," had married into a family by which his ascent might bematured.And then, as they went, came the normal shower of rice, to be picked upin the course of the next hour by the vicarage fowls, and not by theLondon beggars, and the air was darkened by a storm of old shoes. InLondon, white satin slippers are the fashion. But Buston and Buntingfordcombined could not afford enough of such missiles; and from the hands ofthe boys black shoes, and boots too, were thrown freely. "There go mybest pair," said one of the boys, as the chariot was driven off, "and Idon't mean to let them lie there." Then the boots were recovered andtaken up to the bedroom.Now that Molly was gone, Harry's affairs became paramount at Buston.After all, Harry was of superior importance to Molly, though thosechimneys at Buntingford could probably give a better income than theacres belonging to the park. But Harry was to be the future Prosper ofthe county; to assume at some future time the family name; and there wasundoubtedly present to them all at the parsonage a feeling that HarryAnnesley Prosper would loom in future years a bigger squire than theparish had ever known before. He had got a fellowship, which no Prosperhad ever done; and he had the look and tone of a man who had lived inLondon, which had never belonged to the Prospers generally. And he wasto bring a wife, with a good fortune, and one of whom a reputation formany charms had preceded her. And Harry, having been somewhat under acloud for the last six months, was now emerging from it brighter thanever. Even Uncle Prosper could not do without him. That terrible MissThoroughbung had thrown a gloom over Buston Hall which could only beremoved, as the squire himself had felt, by the coming of the naturalheir. Harry was indispensable, and was no longer felt by any one to be aburden.It was now the end of March. Old Mr. Scarborough was dead and buried,and Mountjoy was living at Tretton. Nothing had been heard of his comingup to London. No rushing to the card-tables had been announced. Thatthere were to be some terrible internecine law contests between him andAugustus had been declared in many circles, but of this nothing wasknown at the Buston Rectory. Harry had been one day at Cheltenham, andhad been allowed to spend the best part of an hour with his sweetheart;but this permission had been given on the understanding that he was notto come again, and now for a month he had abstained. Then had come hisuncle's offer, that generous offer under which Harry was to bring hiswife to Buston Hall, and live there during half the year, and to receivean increased allowance for his maintenance during the other half. As hethought of his ways and means he fancied that they would be almost rich.She would have four hundred a year, and he as much; and an establishedhome would be provided for them. Of all these good things he had writtento Florence, but had not yet seen her since the offer had been made. Heranswer had not been as propitious as it might be, and it was absolutelynecessary that he should go down to Cheltenham and settle things.The three years had in his imagination been easily reduced to one, whichwas still, as he thought, an impossible time for waiting. By degrees itcame down to six months in his imagination, and now to three, resultingin an idea that they might be easily married early in June, so as tohave the whole of the summer before them for their wedding-tour."Mother," he said, "I shall be off to-morrow.""To Cheltenham?""Yes, to Cheltenham. What is the good of waiting. I think a girl may betoo obedient to her mother.""It is a fine feeling, which you will be glad to remember that shepossessed.""Supposing that you had declared that Molly shouldn't have married JoeThoroughbung?""Molly has got a father," said Mrs. Annesley."Suppose she had none?""I cannot suppose anything so horrible.""As if you and he had joined together to forbid Molly.""But we didn't.""I think a girl may carry it too far," said Harry. "Mrs. Mountjoy hascommitted herself to Mountjoy Scarborough, and will not go back from herword. He has again come back to the fore, and out of a ruined man hasappeared as the rich proprietor of the town of Tretton. Of course themother hangs on to him still.""You don't think Florence will change?""Not in the least. I'm not a bit afraid of Mountjoy Scarborough and allhis property; but I can see that she may be subjected to much annoyancefrom which I ought to extricate her.""What can you do, Harry?""Go and tell her so. Make her understand that she should put herselfinto my hands at once, and that I could protect her.""Take her away from her mother by force?" said Mrs. Annesley, withhorror."If she were once married her mother would think no more about it. Idon't believe that Mrs. Mountjoy has any special dislike to me. Shethinks of her own nephew, and as long as Florence is Florence Mountjoythere will be for her the chance. I know that he has no chance; and Idon't think that I ought to leave her there to be bullied for someendless period of time. Think of three years,--of dooming a girl to livethree years without ever seeing her lover! There is an absurdity aboutit which is revolting. I shall go down to-morrow and see if I cannot puta stop to it." To this the mother could make no objection, though shecould express no approval of a project under which Florence was to bemade to marry without her mother's consent.CHAPTER LX.MR. SCARBOROUGH IS BURIED.When Mr. Scarborough died, and when he had been buried, his son Mountjoywas left alone at Tretton, living in a very desolate manner. Till theday of the funeral, Merton, the doctor, had remained with him and hisaunt, Miss Scarborough; but when the old squire had been laid in hisgrave they both departed. Miss Scarborough was afraid of her nephew, andcould not look forward to living comfortably at the big house; and Dr.Merton had the general work of his life to call him away. "You might aswell stay for another week," Mountjoy had said to him. But Merton hadfelt that he could not remain at Tretton without some especial duty, andhe too went his way.The funeral had been very strange. Augustus had refused to come andstand at his father's grave. "Considering all things, I had ratherdecline," he had written to Mountjoy. Other guests--none were invited,except the tenants. They came in a body, for the squire had been notedamong them as a liberal landlord.But a crowd of tenants does not in any way make up that look of familysorrow which is expected at the funeral of such a man as Mr.Scarborough. Mountjoy was there, and stood through the ceremonyspeechless, and almost sullen. He went down to the church behind thebody with Merton, and then walked away from the ground without havinguttered a syllable. But during the ceremony he had seen that whichcaused him to be sullen. Mr. Samuel Hart had been there, and Mr.Tyrrwhit. And there was a man whom he called to his mind as connectedwith the names of Evans & Crooke, and Mr. Spicer, and Mr. RichardJuniper. He knew them all as they stood there round the grave, not indecorous funeral array, but as strangers who had strayed into thecemetery. He could not but feel, as he looked at them and they at him,that they had come to look after their interest,--their heavy interest onthe money which had been fraudulently repaid to them. He knew that theyhad parted with their bonds. But he knew also that almost all that wasnow his would have been theirs, had they not been cheated into believingthat he, Mountjoy Scarborough, was not, and never would be, Scarboroughof Tretton Park. They said nothing as they stood there, and did not inany way interrupt the ceremony; but they looked at Mountjoy as theywere standing, and their looks disconcerted him terribly.He had declared that he would walk back to the house which was not abovetwo miles distant from the graveyard, and therefore, when the funeralwas over, there was no carriage to take him. But he knew that the menwould dog his steps as he walked. He had only just got within theprecincts of the park when he saw them all. But Mr. Tyrrwhit was byhimself, and came up to him. "What are you going to do, CaptainScarborough," he said, "as to our claims?""You have no claims of which I am aware," he said roughly."Oh yes, Captain Scarborough; we have claims, certainly. You've come upto the front lately with a deal of luck; I don't begrudge it, for one;but I have claims,--I and those other gentlemen; we have claims. You'llhave to admit that.""Send in the documents. Mr. Barry is acting as my lawyer; he is Mr.Grey's partner, and is now taking the leading share in the business.""I know Mr. Barry well; a very sharp gentleman is Mr. Barry.""I cannot enter into conversation with yourself at such a time as this.""We are sorry to trouble you; but then our interests are so pressing.What do you mean to do, Captain Scarborough? That's the question.""Yes; with the estate," said Mr. Samuel Hart, coming up and joiningthem. Of the lot of men, Mr. Samuel Hart was the most distasteful toMountjoy. He had last seen his Jew persecutor at Monte Carlo, and hadthen, as he thought, been grossly insulted by him. "What are you hafter,captain?" To this Mountjoy made no answer, but Hart, walking a step ortwo in advance, turned upon his heels and looked at the park around him."Tidy sort of place, ain't it, Tyrrwhit, for a gentleman to hang his 'atup, when we were told he was a bastard, not worth a shilling?""I have nothing to do with all that," said Mountjoy; "you and Mr.Tyrrwhit held my acceptances for certain sums of money. They have, Ibelieve, been paid in full.""No, they ain't; they ain't been paid in full at all; you knows theyain't." As he said this, Mr. Hart walked on in front, and stood in thepathway, facing Mountjoy. "How can you 'ave the cheek to say we've beenpaid in full? You know it ain't true.""Evans & Crooke haven't been paid, so far," said a voice from behind."More ain't Spicer," said another voice."Captain Scarborough, I haven't been paid in full," said Mr. Juniper,advancing to the front. "You don't mean to tell me that my five hundredpounds have been paid in full? You've ruined me, Captain Scarborough. Iwas to have been married to a young lady with a large fortune,--your Mr.Grey's niece,--and it has been broken off altogether because of your badtreatment. Do you mean to assert that I have been paid in full?""If you have got any document, take it to Mr. Barry.""No, I won't; I won't take it to any lawyer. I'll take it right inbefore the Court, and expose you. My name is Juniper, and I've neverparted with a morsel of paper that has your name to it.""Then, no doubt, you'll get your money," said the captain."I thought, gentlemen, you were to allow me to be the spokesman on thisoccasion," said Mr. Tyrrwhit. "We certainly cannot do any good if weattack the captain all at once. Now, Captain Scarborough, we don't wantto be uncivil.""Uncivil be blowed!" said Mr. Hart; "I want to get my money, and mean to'ave it. I agreed as you was to speak, Mr. Tyrrwhit; but I means to bespoken up for; and if no one else can do it, I can do it myself. Is weto have any settlement made to us, or is we to go to law?""I can only refer you to Mr. Barry," said Mountjoy, walking on veryrapidly. He thought that when he reached the house he might be able toenter in and leave them out, and he thought also that if he kept them onthe trot he would thus prevent them from attacking him with many words.Evans & Crooke were already lagging behind, and Mr. Spicer was givingsigns of being hard pressed. Even Hart, who was younger than the others,was fat and short, and already showed that he would have to halt if hemade many speeches."Barry be d----d!" exclaimed Hart."You see how it is, Captain Scarborough," said Tyrrwhit; "Your father,as has just been laid to rest in hopes of a a happy resurrection, was avery peculiar gentleman.""The most hinfernal swindler I ever 'eard tell of!" said Hart."I don't wish to say a word disrespectful," continued Tyrrwhit, "but hehad his own notions. He said as you was illegitimate,--didn't he, now?""I can only refer you to Mr. Barry," said Mountjoy."And he said that Mr. Augustus was to have it all; and he proved hiswords,--didn't he, now? And then he made out that, if so, our deedsweren't worth the paper they were written on. Isn't it all true what I'msaying? And then when we'd taken what small sums of money he chose tooffer us, just to save ourselves from ruin, then he comes up and saysyou are the heir, as legitimate as anybody else, and are to have all theproperty. And he proves that too! What are we to think about it?"There was nothing left for Mountjoy Scarborough but to make the pace asgood as possible. Mr. Hart tried once and again to stop their progressby standing in the captain's path, but could only do this sufficientlyat each stoppage to enable him to express his horror with variousinterjections. "Oh laws! that such a liar as 'e should ever be buried!""You can't do anything by being disrespectful, Mr. Hart," said Tyrrwhit."What--is it--he means--to do?" ejaculated Spicer."Mr. Spicer," said Mountjoy, "I mean to leave it all in the hands of Mr.Barry; and, if you will believe me, no good can be done by any of you byhunting me across the park.""Hare you a bastard, or haren't you?" ejaculated Hart."No, Mr. Hart, I am not.""Then pay us what you h'owes us. You h'ain't h'agoing to say as you don'th'owe us?""Mr. Tyrrwhit," said the captain, "it is of no use my answering Mr.Hart, because he is angry.""H'angry! By George, I h'am angry! I'd like to pull that h'old sinner'sbones h'out of the ground!""But to you I can say that Mr. Barry will be better able to tell youthan I am what can be done by me to defend my property.""Captain Scarborough," said Mr. Tyrrwhit, mildly, "we had your name, youknow. We did have your name.""And my father bought the bonds back.""Oh laws! And he calls himself a shentleman!""I have nothing farther to say to you now, gentlemen, and can only referyou to Mr. Barry." The path on which they were walking had then broughtthem to the corner of a garden wall, through which a door opened intothe garden. Luckily, at the moment, it occurred to Mountjoy that therewas a bolt on the other side of the gate, and he entered it quickly andbolted the door. Mr. Tyrrwhit was left on the other side, and was joinedby his companions as quickly as their failing breath enabled them to doso. "'Ere's a go!" said Mr. Hart, striking the door violently with thehandle of his stick."He had nothing for it but to leave us when we attacked him altogether,"said Mr. Tyrrwhit. "If you had left it to me he would have told us whathe intended to do. You, Mr. Hart, had not so much cause to be angry, asyou had received a considerable sum for interest." Then Mr. Hart turnedupon Mr. Tyrrwhit, and abused him all the way back to their inn. But itwas pleasant to see how these commercial gentlemen, all engaged in thenatural course of trade, expressed their violent indignation, not somuch as to their personal losses, but at the commercial dishonestygenerally of which the Scarboroughs, father and son, had been and wereabout to be guilty.Mountjoy, when he reached the house of which he was now the onlyoccupant besides the servants, stood for an hour in the dining-room withhis back toward the fire, thinking of his position. He had many thingsof which to think. In the first place, there were these pseudo-creditorswho had just attacked him in his own park with much acrimony. Heendeavored to comfort himself by telling himself that they werecertainly pseudo-creditors, to whom he did not in fact owe a penny. Mr.Barry could deal with them.But then his conscience reminded him that they had, in truth, beencheated,--cheated by his father for his benefit. For every pound whichthey had received they would have claimed three or four. They would nodoubt have cheated him. But how was he now to measure the extent of hisfather's fraud against that of his creditors? And though it would havebeen right in him to resist the villany of these Jews, he felt that itwas not fit that he should escape from their fangs altogether by hisfather's deceit. He had not become so dead to honor but that _noblesseoblige_ did still live within his bosom. And yet there was nothing thathe could do to absolve his bosom. The income of the estate was nearlyclear, the money brought in by the late sales having all but sufficed togive these gentlemen that which his father had chosen to pay them. Butwas he sure of that income? He had just now asserted boldly that he wasthe legitimate heir to the property; but did he know that he was so?Could he believe his father? Had not Mr. Grey asserted that he would notaccept this later evidence? Was he not sure that Augustus intended toproceed against him? and was he not aware that nothing could be calledhis own till that lawsuit should have been decided? If that should begiven against him, then these harpies would have been treated only toowell; then there would be no question, at any rate by him, as to what_noblesse oblige_ might require of him. He could take no immediate stepin regard to them, and therefore, for the moment, drove that troublefrom his mind.But what should he do with himself as to his future life? To bepersecuted and abused by these wretched men, as had this morning beenhis fate, would be intolerable. Could he shut himself up from Mr. SamuelHart and still live in England? And then could he face the clubs,--if theclubs would be kind enough to re-elect him? And then there came a darkfrown across his brow, as he bethought himself that even at this momenthis heart was longing to be once more among the cards. Could he notescape to Monaco, and there be happy among the gambling-tables? Mr. Hartwould surely not follow him there, and he would be free from thesurveillance of that double blackguard, his brother's servant and hisfather's spy.But, after all, as he declared to himself, did it not altogether turn onthe final answer which he might get from Florence Mountjoy? CouldFlorence be brought to accede to his wishes, he thought that he mightstill live happily, respectably, and in such a manner that his namemight go down to posterity not altogether blasted. If Florence wouldconsent to live at Tretton, then could he remain there. He thought itover as he stood there with his back to the fire, and he told himselfthat with Florence the first year would be possible, and that after thefirst year the struggle would cease to be a struggle. He knew himself,he declared, and he made all manner of excuses for his former viciouslife, basing them all on the hardness of her treatment of him. He didnot know himself, and such assurances were vain. But buoyed up by suchassurances, he resolved that his future fate must be in her hands, andthat her word alone should suffice either to destroy him or to save him.Thinking thus of his future life, he resolved that he would go at onceto Cheltenham, and throw himself, and what of Tretton belonged to him,at the girl's feet. Nor could he endure himself to rest another night atTretton till he had done so. He started at once, and got late toGloucester, where he slept, and on the next morning at eleven o'clockwas at Cheltenham, out on his way to Montpellier Terrace. He at onceasked for Florence, but circumstances so arranged themselves that hefirst found himself closeted with her mother. Mrs. Mountjoy wasdelighted, and yet shocked, to see him. "My poor brother!" she said;"and he was buried only yesterday!" Such explanation as Mountjoy couldgive was given. He soon made the whole tenor of his thoughtsintelligible to her. "Yes; Tretton was his,--at least he supposed so. Asto his future life he could say nothing. It must depend on Florence. Hethought that if she would promise to become at once his wife, therewould be no more gambling. He had felt it to be incumbent on him to comeand tell her so."Mrs. Mountjoy, frightened by the thorough blackness of his apparel andby the sternness of his manner, had not a word to say to him inopposition. "Be gentle with her," she said, as she led the way to theroom in which Florence was found. "Your cousin has come to see you," shesaid; "has come immediately after the funeral. I hope you will begracious to him." Then she closed the door, and the two were alonetogether."Florence!" he said."Mountjoy! We hardly expected you here so soon.""Where the heart strays the body is apt to follow. I could speak to noone, I could do nothing, I could hope and pray for nothing till I hadseen you.""You cannot depend on me like that," she answered."I do depend on you most entirely. No human being can depend morethoroughly on another. It is not my fortune that I have come to offeryou, or simply my love, but in very truth my soul.""Mountjoy, that is wicked!""Then wicked let it be. It is true. Tretton, by singular circumstances,is all my own, free of debt. At any rate, I and others believe it to beso.""Tretton being all your own can make no difference.""I told you that I had not come to offer you my fortune." And he almostscowled at her as he spoke. "You know what my career has hitherto been,though you do not perhaps know what has driven me to it. Shall I goback, and live after the same fashion, and let Tretton go to the dogs?It will be so unless you take me and Tretton into your hands.""It cannot be.""Oh, Florence! think of it before you pronounce my doom.""It cannot be. I love you well as my cousin, and for your sake I loveTretton also. I would suffer much to save you, if any suffering on mypart would be of avail. But it cannot be in that fashion." Then hescowled again at her. "Mountjoy, you frighten me by your hard looks;--butthough you were to kill me you cannot change me. I am the promised wifeof Harry Annesley; and for his honor I must bid you plead this cause nomore." Then, just at this moment there was a ring at the bell and aknock at the door, each of them somewhat impetuous, and FlorenceMountjoy, jumping up with a start, knew that Harry Annesley was there.CHAPTER LXI.HARRY ANNESLEY IS ACCEPTED.She knew that Harry Annesley was at the door. He had written to say thathe must come again, though he had fixed no day for his coming. She hadbeen delighted to think that he should come, though she had after herfashion, scolded him for the promised visit. But, though his comings hadnot been frequent, she recognized already the sounds of his advent. Whena girl really loves her lover, the very atmosphere tells of hiswhereabouts. She was expecting him with almost breathless expectationwhen her cousin Mountjoy was brought to her; and so was her mother, whohad been told that Harry Annesley had business on which he intended tocall. But now the two foes must meet in her presence. That was the ideawhich first came upon her. She was sure that Harry would behave well.Why should not a favored lover on such occasions always behave well? Buthow would Mountjoy conduct himself when brought face to face with hisrival? As Florence thought of it, she remembered that when last they metthe quarrel between them had been outrageous. And Mountjoy had been thesinner, while Harry had been made to bear the punishment of the sin.Harry, when he was told that Miss Mountjoy was at home, had at oncewalked in and opened for himself the door of the front room downstairs.There he found Florence and Mountjoy Scarborough. Mrs. Mountjoy wasstill up-stairs in her bedroom, and was palpitating with fear as shethought of the anger of the two combative lovers. To her belief, Harrywas, of the two, the most like to a roaring lion, because she had heardof him that he had roared so dreadfully on that former occasion. But shedid not instantly go down, detained in her bedroom by the eagerness ofher fear, and by the necessity of resolving how she would behave whenshe got there.Harry, when he entered, stood a moment at the door, and then, hurryingacross the room, offered Scarborough his hand. "I have been so sorry,"he said, "to hear of your loss; but your father's health was such thatyou could not have expected that his life should be prolonged." Mountjoymuttered something, but his mutterings, as Florence had observed, weremade in courtesy. And the two men had taken each other by the hand;after that they could hardly fly at each other's throats in herpresence. Then Harry crossed to Florence and took her hand. "I never geta line from you," he said, laughing, "but what you scold me. I think Iescape better when I am present; so here I am.""You always make wicked propositions, and of course I scold you. A girlhas to go on scolding till she's married, and then it's her turn to getit.""No wonder, then, that you talk of three years so glibly. I want to beable to scold you."All this was going on in Mountjoy's presence, while he stood by, silent,black, and scowling. His position was very difficult,--that of hearingthe billing and cooing of these lovers. But theirs also was not tooeasy, which made the billing and cooing necessary in his presence. Eachhad to seem to be natural, but the billing and cooing were in truthaffected. Had he not been there, would they not have been in eachother's arms? and would not she have made him the proudest man inEngland by a loving kiss? "I was asking Miss Mountjoy, when you came in,to be my wife." This Scarborough said with a loud voice, looking Harryfull in the face."It cannot be," said Florence; "I told you that, for his honor,"--and shelaid her hand on Harry's arm,--"I could listen to no such request.""The request has to be made again," he said."It will be made in vain," said Harry."So, no doubt, you think," said Captain Scarborough."You can ask herself," said Harry."Of course it will be made in vain," said Florence. "Does he think thata girl, in such a matter as that of loving a man, can be turned here andthere at a moment's notice,--that she can say yes and no alternately totwo men? It is impossible. Harry Annesley has chosen me, and I aminfinitely happy in his choice." Here Harry made an attempt to get hisarm round her waist, in which, however, she prevented him, seeing theangry passion rising in her cousin's eyes. "He is to be my husband, Ihope. I have told him that I love him, and I tell you so also. He has mypromise, and I cannot take it back without perjury to him, and ruin,absolute ruin, to myself. All my happiness in this world depends on him.He is to me my own one absolute master, to whom I have given myselfaltogether, as far as this world goes. Even were he to reject me I couldnot give myself to another.""My Florence! my darling!" Harry exclaimed."After having told you so much, can you ask your cousin to be untrue toher word and to her heart, and to become your wife when her heart isutterly within his keeping? Mountjoy, it is impossible.""What of me, then?" he said."Rouse yourself and love some other girl and marry her, and so do wellwith yourself and with your property.""You talk of your heart," he said, "and you bid me use my own after suchfashion as that!""A man's heart can be changed, but not a woman's. His love is but onething among many.""It is the one thing," said Harry. Then the door opened, and Mrs.Mountjoy entered the room."Oh dear! oh dear!" she said, "you, both of you, here together?""Yes: we are both here together," said Harry.There was an unfortunate smile on his face as he said so, which madeMountjoy Scarborough very angry. The two men were both handsome, two ashandsome men as you shall see on a summer's day. Mountjoy wasdark-visaged, with coal-black whiskers and mustaches, with sparkling,angry eyes, and every feature of his face well cut and finely formed;but there was absent from him all look of contentment or satisfaction.Harry was light-haired, with long, silken beard, and bright eyes; butthere was usually present to his face a look of infinite joy, which wascomfortable to all beholders. If not strong, as was the other man's, itwas happy and eloquent of good temper. But in one thing they werealike:--neither of them counted aught on his good looks. Mountjoy hadattempted to domineer by his bad temper, and had failed; but Harry,without any attempt at domineering, always doubting of himself till hehad been assured of success by her lips, had succeeded. Now he was veryproud of his success; but he was proud of her, and not of himself."You come in here and boast of what you have done in my presence," saidMountjoy Scarborough."How can I not seem to boast when she tells me that she loves me?" saidHarry."For God's sake, do not quarrel here!" said Mrs. Mountjoy."They shall not quarrel at all," said Florence, "There is no cause forquarrelling. When a girl has given herself away there should be an endof it. No man who knows that she has done so should speak to her againin the way of love. I will leave you now; but, Harry, you must comeagain, in order that I may tell you that you must not have it all yourown way, just as you please, sir." Then she gave him her hand, andpassing on at once to Mountjoy, tendered her hand to him also. "You aremy cousin, and the head now of my mother's family. I would fain knowthat you would say a kind word to me, and bid me 'God speed.'"He looked at her, but did not take her hand. "I cannot do it," he said."I cannot bid you 'God speed.' You have ruined me, trampled upon me,destroyed me. I am not angry with him," and he pointed across the roomto Harry Annesley; "nor with you; but only with myself." Then, withoutspeaking a word to his aunt, he marched out of the room and left thehouse, closing the front-door after him with a loud noise, whichtestified to his anger."He has gone!" said Mrs. Mountjoy, with a tone of deep tragedy."It is better so," said Florence."A man must take his chance in such warfare as this," said Harry. "Thereis something about Mountjoy Scarborough that, after all, I like. I donot love Augustus, but, with certain faults, Mountjoy is a good fellow.""He is the head of our family," said Mrs. Mountjoy, "and is the owner ofTretton.""That is nothing to do with it," said Florence."It has much to do with it," said her mother, "though you would neverlisten to me. I had set my heart upon it, but you have determined tothwart me. And yet there was a time when you preferred him to every oneelse.""Never!" said Florence, with energy."Yes, you did,--before Mr. Annesley here came in the way.""It was before I came, at any rate," said Harry."I was young, and I did not wish to be disobedient. But I never lovedhim, and I never told him so. Now it is out of the question.""He will never come back again," said Mrs. Mountjoy, mournfully."I should be very glad to see him back when I and Florence are man andwife. I don't care how soon we should see him.""No; he will never come back," said Florence,--"not as he came to-day.That trouble is at last over, mamma.""And my trouble is going to begin.""Why should there be any trouble? Harry will not give you trouble;--willyou, Harry?""Never, I trust," said Harry."He cannot understand," said Mrs. Mountjoy; "he knows nothing of thedesire and ambition of my life. I had promised him my child, and my wordto him is now broken.""He will have known, mamma, that you could not promise for me. Now go,Harry, because we are flurried. May I not ask him to come here to-nightand to drink tea with us?" This she said, addressing her mother in atone of sweetest entreaty. To this Mrs. Mountjoy unwillingly yielded,and then Harry also took his departure.Florence was aware that she had gained much by the interview of themorning. Even to her it began to appear unnecessary that she should keepHarry waiting three years. She had spoken of postponing the time of herservitude and of preserving for herself the masterdom of her owncondition. But in that respect the truth of her own desires was wellunderstood by them all. She was anxious enough to submit to her newmaster, and she felt that the time was coming. Her mother had yielded somuch, and Mountjoy had yielded. Harry was saying to himself at this verymoment that Mountjoy had thrown up the sponge. She, too, was declaringthe same thing for her own comfort in less sporting phraseology, and,what was much more to her, her mother had nearly thrown up the spongealso. In the worse days of her troubles any suitor had made himselfwelcome to her mother who would rescue her child from the fangs of thatroaring lion, Harry Annesley. Mr. Anderson had been received with openarms, and even M. Grascour. Mrs. Mountjoy had then got it into her headthat of all lions which were about in those days Harry roared theloudest. His sins in regard to leaving poor Mountjoy speechless andmotionless on the pavement had filled her with horror. But Florence nowfelt that all that had come to an end. Not only had Mountjoy gone away,but no mention would probably be ever again made of Anderson orGrascour. When Florence was preparing herself for tea that evening shesang a little song to herself as to the coming of the conquering hero."A man must take his chance in such warfare as this," she said,repeating to herself her lover's words."You can't expect me to be very bright," her mother said to her beforeHarry came.There was a sign of yielding in this also; but Florence in her happinessdid not wish to make her mother miserable, "Why not be bright, mamma?Don't you know that Harry is good?""No. How am I to know anything about him? He may be utterly penniless.""But his uncle has offered to let us live in the house and to give us anincome. Mr. Prosper has abandoned all idea of getting married.""He can be married any day. And why do you want to live in another man'shouse when you may live in your own? Tretton is ready for you,--thefinest mansion in the whole county." Here Mrs. Mountjoy exaggerated alittle, but some exaggeration may be allowed to a lady in hercircumstances."Mamma, you know that I cannot live at Tretton.""It is the house in which I was born.""How can that signify? When such things happen they are used asadditional grounds for satisfaction. But I cannot marry your nephewbecause you were born in a certain house. And all that is over now: youknow that Mountjoy will not come back again.""He would," exclaimed the mother, as though with new hopes."Oh, mamma! how can you talk like that? I mean to marry HarryAnnesley;--you know that I do. Why not make your own girl happy byaccepting him?" Then Mrs. Mountjoy left the room and went to her ownchamber and cried there, not bitterly, I think, but copiously. Her girlwould be the wife of the squire of Buston, who, after all, was not a badsort of fellow. At any rate he would not gamble. There had always beenthat terrible drawback. And he was a fellow of his college, in which shewould look for, and probably would find, some compensation as toTretton. When, therefore, she came down to tea, she was able to receiveHarry not with joy but at least without rebuke.Conversation was at first somewhat flat between the two. If the oldlady could have been induced to remain up-stairs, Harry felt that theevening would have been much more satisfactory. But, as it was, he foundhimself enabled to make some progress. He at once began to addressFlorence as his undoubted future spouse, very slyly using words adaptedfor that purpose: and she, without any outburst of her intention,--as shehad made when discussing the matter with her cousin,--answered him in thesame spirit, and by degrees came so to talk as though the matter wereentirely settled. And then, at last, that future day was absolutelybrought on the tapis as though now to be named."Three years!" ejaculated Mrs. Mountjoy, as though not even yetsurrendering her last hope.Florence, from the nature of the circumstances, received this insilence. Had it been ten years she might have expostulated. But a younglady's bashfulness was bound to appear satisfied with an assurance ofmarriage within three years. But it was otherwise with Harry. "Good God,Mrs. Mountjoy, we shall all be dead!" he cried out.Mrs. Mountjoy showed by her countenance that she was extremely shocked."Oh, Harry!" said Florence, "none of us, I hope, will be dead in threeyears.""I shall be a great deal too old to be married if I am left alive. Threemonths, you mean. It will be just the proper time of year, which does gofor something. And three months is always supposed to be long enough toallow a girl to get her new frocks.""You know nothing about it, Harry," said Florence. And so the matter wasdiscussed--in such a manner that when Harry took his departure thatevening he was half inclined to sing a song of himself about theconquering hero. "Dear mamma!" said Florence, kissing her mother withall the warm, clinging affection of former years. It was verypleasant,--but still Mrs. Mountjoy went to her room with a sad heart.When there she sat for a while over the fire, and then drew out herdesk. She had been beaten,--absolutely beaten,--and it was necessary thatshe should own so much in writing to one person. So she wrote herletter, which was as follows:"Dear Mountjoy,--After all it cannot be as I would have had it. As theysay, 'Man proposes, but God disposes.' I would have given her to younow, and would even yet have trusted that you would have treated herwell, had it not been that Mr. Annesley has gained such a hold upon heraffections. She is wilful, as you are, and I cannot bend her. It hasbeen the longing of my heart that you two should live together atTretton. But such longings are, I think, wicked, and are seldomrealized."I write now just this one line to tell you that it is all settled. Ihave not been strong enough to prevent such settling. He talks of threemonths! But what does it matter? Three months or three years will be thesame to you, and nearly the same to me."Your affectionate aunt,"SARAH MOUNTJOY."P.S.--May I as your loving aunt add one word of passionate entreaty?All Tretton is yours now, and the honor of Tretton is within yourkeeping. Do not go back to those wretched tables!"Mountjoy Scarborough when he received this letter cannot be said to havebeen made unhappy by it, because he had already known all hisunhappiness. But he turned it in his mind as though to think what wouldnow be the best course of life open to him. And he did think that he hadbetter go back to those tables against which his aunt had warned him,and there remain till he had made the acres of Tretton utterlydisappear. There was nothing for him which seemed to be better. And hereat home in England even that would at present be impossible to him. Hecould not enter the clubs, and elsewhere Samuel Hart would be ever athis heels. And there was his brother with his lawsuit, though on thatmatter a compromise had already been offered to him. Augustus hadproposed to him by his lawyer to share Tretton. He would never shareTretton. His brother should have an income secured to him, but he wouldkeep Tretton in his own hands,--as long as the gambling-tables wouldallow him.He was, in truth, a wretched man, as on that night he did make up hismind, and ringing his bell called his servant out of his bed to bid himprepare everything for a sudden start. He would leave Tretton on thefollowing day, or on the day after, and intended at once to go abroad."He is off for that place nigh to Italy where they have thegambling-tables," said the butler, on the following morning, to thevalet who declared his master's intentions."I shouldn't wonder, Mr. Stokes," said the valet. "I'm told it's abeauteous country and I should like to see a little of that sort oflife myself." Alas, alas! Within a week from that time CaptainScarborough might have been seen seated in the Monte Carlo room, withoutany friendly Samuel Hart to stand over him and guard him.CHAPTER LXII.THE LAST OF MR. GREY."I have put in my last appearance at the old chamber in Lincoln's InnFields," said Mr. Grey, on arriving home one day early in June."Papa, you don't mean it!" said Dolly."I do. Why not one day as well as another? I have made up my mind thatit is to be so. I have been thinking of it for the last six weeks. It isdone now.""But you have not told me.""Well, yes; I have told you all that was necessary. It has come now alittle sudden, that is all.""You will never go back again?""Well, I may look in. Mr. Barry will be lord and master.""At any rate he won't be my lord and master!" said Dolly, showing by thetone of her voice that the matter had been again discussed by them sincethe last conversation which was recorded, and had been settled to herfather's satisfaction."No;--you at least will be left to me. But the fact is, I cannot have anyfarther dealings with the affairs of Mr. Scarborough. The old man who isdead was too many for me. Though I call him old, he was ever so muchyounger than I am. Barry says he was the best lawyer he ever knew. Asthings go now a man has to be accounted a fool if he attempts to runstraight. Barry does not tell me that I have been a fool, but he clearlythinks so.""Do you care what Mr. Barry thinks or says?""Yes, I do,--in regard to the professional position which I hold. He isconfident that Mountjoy Scarborough is his father's eldest legitimateson, and he believes that the old squire simply was anxious to supersedehim to get some cheap arrangement made as to his debts.""I supposed that was the case before.""But what am I to think of such a man? Mr. Barry speaks of him almostwith affection. How am I to get on with such a man as Mr. Barry?""He himself is honest.""Well;--yes, I believe so. But he does not hate the absolute utterroguery of our own client. And that is not quite all. When the story ofthe Rummelsburg marriage was told I did not believe one word of it, andI said so most strongly. I did not at first believe the story that therehad been no such marriage, and I swore to Mr. Scarborough that I wouldprotect Mountjoy and Mountjoy's creditors against any such scheme asthat which was intended. Then I was convinced. All the details of theNice marriage were laid before me. It was manifest that the lady hadsubmitted to be married in a public manner and with all regular forms,while she had a baby, as it were, in her arms. And I got all the dates.Taking that marriage for granted, Mountjoy was clearly illegitimate, andI was driven so to confess. Then I took up arms on behalf of Augustus.Augustus was a thoroughly bad fellow,--a bully and a tyrant; but he wasthe eldest son. Then came the question of paying the debts. I thoughtit a very good thing that the debts should be payed in the proposedfashion. The men were all to get the money they had actually lent, andno better arrangement seemed to be probable. I helped in that, feelingthat it was all right. But it was a swindle that I was made to assistin. Of course it was a swindle, if the Rummelsburg marriage be true, andall these creditors think that I have been a party to it. Then I sworethat I wouldn't believe the Rummelsburg marriage. But Barry and the restof them only shake their heads and laugh, and I am told that Mr.Scarborough was the best lawyer among us!""What does it matter? How can that hurt you?" asked Dolly."It does hurt me;--that is the truth. I have been at my business longenough. Another system has grown up which does not suit me. I feel thatthey all can put their fingers in my eyes. It may be that I am a fool,and that my idea of honesty is a mistake.""No!" shouted Dolly."I heard of a rich American the other day who had been poor, and wasasked how he had suddenly become so well off. 'I found a partner,' saidthe American, 'and we went into business together. He had the capitaland I had the experience. We just made a change. He has the experiencenow and I have the capital.' When I knew that story I went to strip hiscoat off the wretch's back; but Mr. Barry would give him a fine furcloak as a mark of respect. When I find that clever rascals arerespectable, I think it is time that I should give up work altogether."Thus it was that Mr. Grey left the house of Grey & Barry, driven topremature retirement by the vices, or rather frauds, of old Mr.Scarborough. When Augustus went to work, which he did immediately on hisfather's death, to wrest the property from the hands of his brother,--orwhat part of the property might be possible,--Mr. Grey absolutelydeclined to have anything to do with the case. Mr. Barry explained howimpossible it was that the house, even for its own sake, shouldabsolutely secede from all consideration of the question. Mountjoy hadbeen left in possession, and, according to all the evidence now beforethem, was the true owner. Of course he would want a lawyer, and, as Mr.Barry said, would be very well able to pay for what he wanted. It wasnecessary that the firm should protect themselves against thevindictiveness of Mr. Tyrrwhit and Samuel Hart. Should the firm fail todo so, it would leave itself open to all manner of evil calumnies. Thefirm had been so long employed on behalf of the Scarboroughs that now,when the old squire was dead, it could not afford to relinquish thebusiness till this final great question had been settled. It wasnecessary, as Mr. Barry said, that they should see it out, Mr. Barrytaking a much more leading part in these discussions than had been hiswont. Consequently Mr. Grey had told him that he might do it himself,and Mr. Barry had been quite contented. Mr. Barry, in talking the matterover with one of the clerks, whom he afterward took into partnership,expressed his opinion that "poor old Grey was altogether off the hooks.""Old Grey" had always been Mr. Grey when spoken of by Mr. Barry tillthat day, and the clerk remarking this, left Mr. Grey's bell unansweredfor three or four minutes. Mr. Grey, though he was quite willing toshelf himself, understood it all, and knocked them about in the chambersthat afternoon with unwonted severity. He said nothing about it when hecame home that evening: but the next day was the last on which he tookhis accustomed chair."What will you do with yourself, papa?" Dolly said to him the nextmorning."Do with myself?""What employment will you take in hand? One has to think of that, and tolive accordingly. If you would like to turn farmer, we must live in thecountry.""Certainly I shall not do that. I need not absolutely throw away whatmoney I have saved.""Or if you were fond of shooting or hunting?""You know very well I never shot a bird, and hardly ever crossed a horsein my life.""But you are fond of gardening.""Haven't I got garden enough here?""Quite enough, if you think so; but will there be occupation sufficientin that to find you employment for all your life?""I shall read.""It seems to me," she said, "that reading becomes wearisome as an onlypursuit, unless you've made yourself accustomed to it.""Sha'n't I have as much employment as you?""A woman is so different! Darning will get through an unlimited numberof hours. A new set of underclothing will occupy me for a fortnight.Turning the big girl's dresses over there into frocks for the littlegirls is sufficient to keep my mind in employment for a month. Then Ihave the maid-servants to look after, and to guard against their lovers.I have the dinners to provide, and to see that the cook does not givethe fragments to the policeman. I have been brought up to do thesethings, and habit has made them usual occupations to me. I never enviedyou when you had to encounter all Mr. Scarborough's vagaries; but I knewthat they sufficed to give you something to do.""They have sufficed," said he, "to leave me without anything that I cando.""You must not allow yourself to be so left. You must find out someemployment." Then they sat silent for a time, while Mr. Grey occupiedhimself with some of the numerous papers which it would be necessarythat he should hand over to Mr. Barry. "And now," said Dolly, "Mr.Carroll will have gone out, and I will go over to the Terrace. I have tosee them every day, and Mr. Carroll has the decency to take himself offto some billiard-table so as to make room for me.""What are they doing about that man?" said Mr. Grey."About the lover? Mr. Juniper has, I fancy, made himself extremelydisagreeable, not satisfying himself with abusing you and me, but pooraunt as well, and all the girls. He has, I fancy, got some money of hisown.""He has had money paid to him by Captain Scarborough; but that I shouldfancy would rather make him in a good humor than the reverse.""He is only in a good humor, I take it, when he has something to get.However, I must be off now, or the legitimate period of Uncle Carroll'sabsence will be over."Mr. Grey, when he was left alone, at once gave up the manipulation ofhis papers, and, throwing himself back into his chair, began to think ofthat future life of which he had talked so easily to his daughter. Whatshould he do with himself? He believed that he could manage with hisbooks for two hours a day; but even of that he was not sure. He muchdoubted whether for many years past the time devoted to reading in hisown house had amounted to one hour a day. He thought that he couldemploy himself in the garden for two hours; but that would fail him whenthere should be hail, or fierce sunshine, or frost, or snow, or rain.Eating and drinking would be much to him; but he could not but lookforward to self-reproach if eating and drinking were to be the joy ofhis life. Then he thought of Dolly's life,--how much purer and better andnobler it had been than his own. She talked in a slighting, carelesstone of her usual day's work, but how much of her time had been occupiedin doing the tasks of others? He knew well that she disliked theCarrolls. She would speak of her own dislike of them as of her greatsin, of which it was necessary that she should repent in sackcloth andashes.But yet how she worked for the family! turning old dresses into newfrocks, as though the girls who had worn them, and the children who wereto wear them, had been to her her dearest friends. Every day she wentacross to the house intent upon doing good offices; and this was therepentance in sackcloth and ashes which she exacted from herself. Couldnot he do as she did? He could not darn Minnie's and Brenda's stockings,but he might do something to make those children more worthy of theircousin's care. He could not associate with his brother-in-law, becausehe was sure that Mr. Carroll would not endure his society; but he mightlabor to do something for the reform even of this abominable man. BeforeDolly had come back to him he had resolved that he could only redeem hislife from the stagnation with which it was threatened by working forothers, now that the work of his own life had come to a close. "Well,Dolly," he said, as soon as she had entered the room, "have you heardany thing more about Mr. Juniper?""Have you been here ever since, papa?""Yes, indeed; I used to sit at chambers for six or seven hours at astretch, almost without getting out of my chair.""And are you still employed about those awful papers?""I have not looked at them since you left the room.""Then you must have been asleep.""No, indeed; I have not been asleep. You left me too much to think of toenable me to sleep. What am I to do with myself besides eating anddrinking, so that I shall not sleep always on this side of the grave?""There are twenty things, papa,--thirty, fifty, for a man so minded asyou are." This she said trying to comfort him."I must endeavor to find one or two of the fifty." Then he went back tohis papers, and really worked hard on that day.On the following morning, early, he went across to Bolsover Terrace, tobegin his task of reproving the Carroll family, without saying a word toDolly indicative of his purpose.He found that the task would be difficult, and as he went he consideredwithin his mind how best it might be accomplished. He had put aprayer-book in his pocket, without giving it much thought; but before heknocked at the door he had assured himself that the prayer-book wouldnot be of avail. He would not know how to begin to use it, and felt thatit would be ridiculed. He must leave that to Dolly or to the clergyman.He could talk to the girls; but they would not care about the affairs ofthe firm; and, in truth, he did not know what they would care about.With Dolly he could hold sweet converse as long as she would remain withhim. But he had been present at the bringing up of Dolly, and did thinkthat gifts had been given to Dolly which had not fallen to the lot ofthe Carroll girls. "They all want to be married," he said to himself,"and that at any rate is a legitimate desire."With this he knocked at the door, and when it was opened by Sophia, hefound an old gentleman with black cotton gloves and a doubtful whitecravat just preparing for his departure. There was Amelia, then givinghim his hat, and looking as pure and proper as though she had never beenwinked at by Prince Chitakov. Then the mother came through from theparlor into the passage. "Oh, John! how very kind of you to come. Mr.Matterson, pray let me introduce you to my brother, Mr. Grey. John, thisis the Rev. Mr. Matterson, a clergyman who is a very intimate friend ofAmelia.""Me, ma! Why me in particular?""Well, my dear, because it is so. I suppose it is so because Mr.Matterson likes you the best.""Laws, ma; what nonsense!" Mr. Matterson appeared to be a very shygentleman, and only anxious to escape from the hall-door. But Mr. Greyremembered that in former days, before the coming of Mr. Juniper uponthe scene, he had heard of a clerical admirer. He had been told that thegentleman's name was Matterson, that he was not very young nor veryrich, that he had five or six children, and that he could afford tomarry if the wife could bring with her about one hundred pounds a year.He had not then thought much of Mr. Matterson, and no direct appeal hadbeen made to him. After that Mr. Juniper had come forward, and then Mr.Juniper had been altogether abolished. But it occurred to Mr. Grey thatMr. Matterson was at any rate better than Mr. Juniper; that he was byprofession a gentleman, and that there might be a beginning of thosegood deeds by which he was anxious to make the evening of his daysbearable to himself."I am delighted to make Mr. Matterson's acquaintance," he said, as thatold gentleman scrambled out of the door.Then his sister took him by the arm and led him at once into the parlor."You might as well come and hear what I have to say, Amelia." So thedaughter followed them in. "He is the most praiseworthy gentleman youever knew, John," began Mrs. Carroll."A clergyman, I think?""Oh yes; he is in orders,--in priest's orders," said Mrs. Carroll,meaning to make the most of Mr. Matterson. "He has a church over atPutney.""I am glad of that," said Mr. Grey."Yes, indeed; though it isn't very good, because it's only a curate'sone hundred and fifty pounds. Yes; he does have one hundred and fiftypounds, and something out of the surplice fees.""Another one hundred pounds I believe it is," said Amelia."Not quite so much as that, my dear, but it is something.""He is a widower with children, I believe?" said Mr. Grey."There are children--five of them; the prettiest little dears one eversaw. The eldest is just about thirteen." This was a fib, because Mrs.Carroll knew that the eldest boy was sixteen; but what did it signify?"Amelia is so warmly attached to them.""It is a settled thing, then?""We hope so. It cannot be said to be quite settled, because there arealways money difficulties. Poor Mr. Matterson must have some increase tohis income before he can afford it.""Ah, yes!""You did say something, uncle, about five hundred pounds," said Amelia."Four hundred and fifty, my dear," said Mr. Grey."Oh, I had forgotten. I did say that I hoped there would be fivehundred.""There shall be five hundred," said Mr. Grey, remembering that now hadcome the time for doing to one of the Carroll family the good things ofwhich he had thought to himself. "As Mr. Matterson is a clergyman ofwhom I have heard nothing but good, it shall be five hundred." He had intruth heard nothing either good or bad respecting Mr. Matterson.Then he asked Amelia to take a walk with him as he went home, reflectingthat now had come the time in which a little wholesome conversationmight have its effect. And an idea entered his head that in his old agean acquaintance with a neighboring clergyman might be salutary tohimself. So Amelia got her bonnet and walked home with him."Is he an eloquent preacher, my dear?" But Amelia had never heard himpreach. "I suppose there will be plenty for you to do in your new home.""I don't mean to be put upon, if you mean that, uncle.""But five children!""There is a servant who looks after them. Of course I shall have to seeto Mr. Matterson's own things, but I have told him I cannot slave forthem all. The three eldest have to be sent somewhere; that has beenagreed upon. He has got an unmarried sister who can quite afford to doas much as that." Then she explained her reasons for the marriage. "Papais getting quite unbearable, and Sophy spoils him in everything."Poor Mr. Grey, when his niece turned and went back home, thought that,as far as the girl was concerned, or her future household, there wouldbe very little room for employment for him. Mr. Matterson wanted anupper servant who instead of demanding wages, would bring a little moneywith her, and he could not but feel that the poor clergyman would findthat he had taken into his house a bad and expensive upper servant."Never mind, papa," said Dolly, "we will go on and persevere, and if weintend to do good, good will come of it."CHAPTER LXIII.THE LAST OF AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH.When old Mr. Scarborough was dead, and had been for a while buried,Augustus made his application in form to Messrs. Grey & Barry. He madeit through his own attorney, and had now received Mr. Barry's answerthrough the same attorney. The nature of the application had been inthis wise: that Mr. Augustus Scarborough had been put in to the positionof the eldest son; that he did not himself in the least doubt that suchwas his true position; that close inquiry had been made at the time, andthat the lawyers, including Mr. Grey and Mr. Barry had assented to thestatements as then made by old Mr. Scarborough; that he himself had thengone to work to pay his brother's debts, for the honor of the family,and had paid them partly out of his own immediate pocket, and partly outof the estate, which was the same as his own property; that during hisbrother's "abeyance" he had assisted in his maintenance, and, on hisbrother's return, had taken him to his own home; that then his fatherhad died, and that this incredible new story had been told. Mr. AugustusScarborough was in no way desirous of animadverting on his father'smemory, but was forced to repeat his belief that he was his father'seldest son, and was, in fact, at that moment the legitimate owner ofTretton, in accordance with the existing contract. He did not wish todispute his father's will, though his father's mental and bodilycondition at the time of the making of the will might, perhaps, enablehim to do so with success. The will might be allowed to pass valid, butthe rights of primogeniture must be held sacred.Nevertheless, having his mother's memory in great honor, he felt himselfill inclined to drag the family history before the public. For hismother's sake he was open to a compromise. He would advise that thewhole property,--that which would pass under the entail, and that whichwas intended to be left by will,--should be valued, and that the totalshould then be divided between them. If his brother chose to take thefamily mansion, it should be so. Augustus Scarborough had no desire toset himself over his brother. But if this offer were not accepted, hemust at once go to law, and prove that their Nice marriage had been, infact, the one marriage by which his father and mother had been joinedtogether. There was another proviso added to this offer: as thevaluation and division of the property must take time, an income at therate of two hundred pounds a month should be allowed to Augustus tillsuch time as it should be completed. Such was the offer which Augustushad authorized his attorney to make.There was some delay in getting Mountjoy to consent to a reply. Beforethe offer had reached Mr. Barry he was already at Monte Carlo, with thatready money his father had left behind him. At every venture that hemade,--at least at every loss which he incurred,--he told himself that itwas altogether the doings of Florence Mountjoy. But he returned toEngland, and consented to a reply. He was the eldest son, and meant tosupport that position, both on his mother's behalf and on his own. As tohis father's will, made in his favor, he felt sure that his brotherwould not have the hardihood to dispute it. A man's bodily sufferingswere no impediment to his making a will; of mental incapacity he hadnever heard his father accused till the accusation had now been made byhis own son. He was, however, well aware that it would not be preferred.As to what his brother had done for himself, it was hardly worth hiswhile to answer such an allegation. His memory carried him but littlefarther back than the day on which his brother turned him out of hisrooms.There were, however, many reasons,--and this was put in at the suggestionof Mr. Barry,--why he would not wish that his brother should be leftpenniless. If his brother would be willing to withdraw altogether fromany lawsuit, and would lend his co-operation to a speedy arrangement ofthe family matters, a thousand a year,--or twenty-five thousandpounds,--should be made over to him as a younger brother's portion. Tothis offer it would be necessary that a speedy reply should be given,and, under such circumstances, no temporary income need be supplied.It was early in June when Augustus was sitting in his luxurious lodgingsin Victoria Street, contemplating this reply. His own lawyer had advisedhim to accept the offer, but he had declared to himself a dozen timessince his father's death that, in this matter of the property, he would"either make a spoon or spoil a horn." And the lawyer was no friend ofhis own,--was not a man who knew nothing of the facts of the case beyondwhat were told him, and nothing of the working of his client's mind.Augustus had looked to him only for the law in the matter, and thelawyer had declared the law to be against his client. "All that yourfather said about the Nice marriage will go for nothing. It will beshown that he had an object.""But there certainly was such a marriage.""No doubt there was some ceremony--performed with an object. A secondmarriage cannot invalidate the first, though it may itself be altogetherinvalidated. The Rummelsburg marriage is, and will be, an establishedfact, and of the Rummelsburg marriage your brother was no doubt theissue. Accept the offer of an income. Of course we can come to terms asto the amount; and from your brother's character it is probable enoughthat he may increase it." Such had been his lawyer's advice, andAugustus was sitting there in his lodging thinking of it.He was not a happy man as he sat there. In the first place he oweda little money, and the debt had come upon him chiefly from his lavishexpenditure in maintaining Mountjoy and Mountjoy's servant upon theirtravels. At that time he had thought that by lavish expenditure he mightmake Tretton certainly his own. He had not known his brother'scharacter, and had thought that by such means he could keep him down,with his head well under water. His brother might drink,--take todrinking regularly at Monte Carlo or some other place,--and might so die.Or he would surely gamble himself into farther and utter ruin. At anyrate he would be well out of the way, and Augustus in his pride had beenglad to feel that he had his brother well under his thumb. Then the debthad been paid with the object of saving the estate from litigation onthe part of the creditors. That had been his one great mistake. And hehad not known his father, or his father's guile, or his father'sstrength. Why had not his father died at once?--as all the world hadassured him would be the case. Looking back he could remember that theidea of paying the creditors had at first come from his father, simplyas a vague idea! Oh, what a crafty rascal his father had been! And thenhe had allowed himself, in his pride, to insult his father, and hadspoken of his father's coming death as a thing that was desirable! Fromthat moment his father had plotted his ruin. He could see it all now.He was still minded to make the spoon; but he found that he should spoilthe horn. Had there been any one to assist him he would still havepersevered. He thought that he could have persevered with a lawyer whowould really have taken up his case with interest. If Mountjoy could bemade to drink--so as to die! He was still next in the entail; and he washis brother's heir should his brother die without a will. But so hewould be if he took the twenty-five thousand pounds. But to accept sopoor a modicum would go frightfully against the grain with him. Heseemed to think that by taking the allowance he would bring back hisbrother to all the long-lived decencies of life. He would have tosurrender altogether that feeling of conscious superiority which hadbeen so much to him. "D----n the fellow!" he exclaimed to himself. "Ishould not wonder if he were in that fellow's pay." The first "fellow"here was the lawyer, and the second was his brother.When he had sat there alone for half an hour he could not make up hismind. When all his debts were paid he would not have much abovetwenty-five thousand pounds. His father had absolutely extracted fivethousand pounds from him toward paying his brother's debts! The moneyhad been wanted immediately. Together with the sum coming from the newpurchasers, father and son must each subscribe five thousand pounds topay those Jews. So it had been represented to him, and he had borrowedthe money to carry out his object. Had ever any one been so swindled, socruelly treated! This might probably be explained, and the five thousandpounds might be added to the twenty-five thousand pounds. But theexplanation would be necessary, and all his pride would rebel againstit. On that night when by chance he had come across his brother,bleeding and still half drunk, as he was about to enter his lodging, howcompletely under his thumb he had been! And now he was offering him ofhis bounty this wretched pittance! Then with half-muttered curses heexecrated the names of his father, his brother, of Grey, and of Barry,and of his own lawyer.At that moment the door was opened and his bosom friend, Septimus Jones,entered the room. At any rate this friend was the nearest he had to hisbosom. He was a man without friends in the true sense. There was no onewho knew the innermost wishes of his heart, the secret desires of hissoul. There are thus so many who can divulge to none those secretwishes! And how can such a one have a friend who can advise him as towhat he shall do? Scarcely can the honest man have such a friend,because it is so difficult for him to find a man who will believe inhim. Augustus had no desire for such a friend, but he did desire someone who would do his bidding as though he were such a friend. He wanteda friend who would listen to his words, and act as though they were thetruth. Mr. Septimus Jones was the man he had chosen, but he did not inthe least believe in Mr. Septimus Jones himself. "What does that mansay?" asked Septimus Jones. The man was the lawyer of whom Augustus wasnow thinking, at this very moment, all manner of evil."D----n him!" said Augustus."With all my heart. But what does he say? As you are to pay him for whathe says, it is worth while listening to it."There was a tone in the voice of Septimus Jones which declared at oncesome diminution of his usual respect. So it sounded, at least, toAugustus. He was no longer the assured heir of Tretton, and in this wayhe was to be told of the failure of his golden hopes. It would be odd,he thought, if he could not still hold his dominion over Septimus Jones."I am not at all sure that I shall listen to him or to you either.""As for that, you can do as you like.""Of course I can do as I like." Then he remembered that he must stilluse the man as a messenger, if in no other capacity. "Of course he wantsto compromise it. A lawyer always proposes a compromise. He cannot bebeat that way, and it is safe for him.""You had agreed to that.""But what are the terms to be?--that is the question. I made myoffer:--half and half. Nothing fairer can be imagined,--unless, indeed, Ichoose to stand out for the whole property.""But what does your brother say?"He could not use his friend even as a messenger without telling himsomething of the truth. "When I think of it, of this injustice, I canhardly hold myself. He proposes to give me twenty-five thousand pounds.""Twenty-five thousand pounds!--for everything?""Everything; yes. What the devil do you suppose I mean? Now just listento me." Then he told his tale as he thought that it ought to be told. Herecapitulated all the money he had spent on his brother's behalf, andall that he chose to say that he had spent. He painted in glowing colorsthe position in which he would have been put by the Nice marriage. Hewas both angry and pathetic about the creditors. And he tore his hairalmost with vexation at the treatment to which he was subjected."I think I'd take the twenty-five thousand pounds," said Jones."Never! I'd rather starve first!""That's about what you'll have to do if all that you tell me is true."There was again that tone of disappearing subjection. "I'll be shot if Iwouldn't take the money." Then there was a pause. "Couldn't you do thatand go to law with him afterward? That was what your father would havedone." Yes; but Augustus had to acknowledge that he was not as clever ashis father.At last he gave Jones a commission. Jones was to see his brother and toexplain to him that, before any question could be raised as to theamount to be paid under the compromise, a sum of ten thousand poundsmust be handed to Augustus to reimburse him for money out of pocket.Then Jones was to say, as out of his own head, that he thought thatAugustus might probably accept fifty thousand pounds in lieu oftwenty-five thousand pounds. That would still leave the bulk of theproperty to Mountjoy, although Mountjoy must be aware of the greatdifficulties which would be thrown in his way by his father's conduct.But Jones had to come back the next day with an intimation that Mountjoyhad again gone abroad, leaving full authority with Mr. Barry.Jones was sent to Mr. Barry, but without effect. Mr. Barry would discussthe matter with the lawyer, or, if Augustus was so pleased, withhimself; but he was sure that no good would be done by any conversationwith Mr. Jones. A month went on--two months went by--and nothing came ofit. "It is no use your coming here, Mr. Scarborough," at last Mr. Barrysaid to him with but scant courtesy. "We are perfectly sure of ourground. There is not a penny due you;--not a penny. If you will signcertain documents, which I would advise you to do in the presence ofyour own lawyer, there will be twenty-five thousand pounds for you. Youmust excuse me if I say that I cannot see you again on thesubject,--unless you accept your brother's liberality."At this time, Augustus was very short of money and, as is always thecase, those to whom he owed aught became pressing as his readiness topay them gradually receded. But to be so spoken to by a lawyer,--he,Scarborough of Tretton, as he had all but been,--to be so addressed by aman whom he had regarded as old Grey's clerk, was bitter indeed. He hadbeen so exalted by that Nice marriage, had been so lifted high in theworld, that he was now absolutely prostrate. He quarrelled with hislawyer, and he quarrelled also with Septimus Jones. There was no onewith whom he could discuss the matter, or rather no one who woulddiscuss it with him on his terms. So at last he accepted the money, andwent daily into the City in order that he might turn it into more. Whatbecame of him in the City it is hardly the province of this chronicle totell.CHAPTER LXIV.THE LAST OF FLORENCE MOUNTJOY.Now at last in this chapter has to be told the fate of FlorenceMountjoy, as far as it can be told in these pages. It was, at any rate,her peculiarity to attach to herself, by bonds which could not easily besevered, those who had once thought that they might be able to win herlove. An attempt has been made to show how firm and determined were theaffections of Harry Annesley, and how absolutely he trusted in her wordwhen once it had been given to him. He had seemed to think that when shehad even nodded to him, in answer to his assertion that he desired herto be his wife, all his trouble as regarded her heart had been off hismind.There might be infinite trouble as to time,--as to ten years, threeyears, or even one year; trouble in inducing her to promise that shewould become his wife in opposition to her mother; but he had felt surethat she never would be the wife of any one else. How he had at lastsucceeded in mitigating the opposition of her mother, so as to make thethree years, or even the one year, appear to himself an altogetherimpossible delay, the reader knows. How he at last contrived to have hisown way altogether, so that, as Florence told him, she was merely a ballin his hand, the reader will have to know very shortly. But not a shadeof doubt had ever clouded Harry's mind as to his eventual success sinceshe had nodded to him at Mrs. Armitage's ball. Though this girl's lovehad been so grand a thing to have achieved, he was quite sure from thatmoment that it would be his forever.With Mountjoy Scarborough there had never come such a moment, and nevercould; yet he had been very confident, so that he had lived on theassurance that such a moment would come. And the self-deportment naturalto her had been such that he had shown his assurance. He never wouldhave succeeded; but he should not the less love her sincerely. And whenthe time came for him to think what he should do with himself, those fewdays after his father's death, he turned to her as his one prospect ofsalvation. If his cousin Florence would be good to him all might yet bewell. He had come by that time to lose his assurance. He had recognizedHarry Annesley as his enemy, as has been told often enough in thesepages. Harry was to him a hateful stumbling-block. And he had not beenquite as sure of her fidelity to another as Harry had been sure of it tohimself. Tretton might prevail. Trettons do so often prevail. And thegirl's mother was all on his side. So he had gone to Cheltenham, true asthe needle to the pole, to try his luck yet once again. He had gone toCheltenham, and there he found Harry Annesley. All hopes for him werethen over and he started at once for Monaco; or, as he himself toldhimself, for the devil.Among the lovers of Florence some memory may attach itself to poor HughAnderson. He too had been absolutely true to Florence. From the hour inwhich he had first conceived the idea that she would make him happy ashis wife, it had gone on growing upon him with all the weight of love,He did not quite understand why he should have loved her so dearly, butthus it was. Such a Mrs. Hugh Anderson, with a pair of horses on theboulevards, was to his imagination the most lovely sight which could bepainted. Then Florence took the mode of disabusing him which has beentold, and Hugh Anderson gave the required promise. Alas, in what anunfortunate moment had he done so! Such was his own thought. For thoughhe was sure of his own attachment to her, he could not mount high enoughto be as sure of her to somebody else. It was a "sort of thing a manoughtn't to have been asked to promise," he said to the third secretary.And having so determined, he made up his mind to follow her to Englandand to try his fortune once again.Florence had just wished Harry good-bye for the day, or rather for theweek. She cared for nothing now in the way of protestations ofaffection. "Come Harry--there now--don't be so unreasonable. Am not Ijust as impatient as you are? This day fortnight you will be back, andthen--""Then there will be some peace, won't there? But mind you write everyday." And so Harry was whisked away, as triumphant a man as ever leftCheltenham by the London train. On the following morning Hugh Andersonreached Cheltenham and appeared in Montpellier Place."My daughter is at home, certainly," said Mrs. Mountjoy. There wassomething in the tone which made the young man at once assure himselfthat he had better go back to Brussels. He had even been a favorite withMrs. Mountjoy. In his days of love-making poor Mountjoy had been absent,declared no longer to have a chance of Tretton, and Harry had been--thevery evil one himself. Mrs. Mountjoy had been assured by the BrusselsMountjoy that, with the view of getting well rid of the evil one, shehad better take poor Anderson to her bosom. She had opened her bosomaccordingly, but with very poor results. And now he had come to lookafter what result there might be. Mrs. Mountjoy felt that he had bettergo back to Brussels."Could I not see her?" asked Anderson."Well, yes; you could see her.""Mrs. Mountjoy, I'll tell you everything, just as though you were my ownmother. I have loved your daughter;--oh, I don't know how it is! If she'dbe my wife for two years, I don't think I'd mind dying afterward.""Oh, Mr. Anderson!""I wouldn't. I never heard of a case where a girl had got such a hold ofa man as she has of me.""You don't mean to say that she has behaved badly?""Oh no! She couldn't behave badly;--it isn't in her. But she can bowl afellow over in the most--well, most desperate manner. As for me, I'm notworth my salt since I first saw her. When I go to ride with the governorI haven't a word to say to him," But this ended in Mrs. Mountjoy goingand promising that she would send Florence down in her place. She knewthat it would be in vain; but to a young man who had behaved so well asMr. Anderson so much could not be refused. "Here I am again," he said,very much like Punch in the pantomime."Oh, Mr. Anderson! how do you do?"A lover who is anxious to prevail with a lady should always hold up hishead. Where is the writer of novels, or of human nature, who does notknow as much as that? And yet the man who is in love, truly in love,never does hold up his head very high. It is the man who is not in lovewho does so. Nevertheless it does sometimes happen that the true loverobtains his reward. In this case it was not observed to be so. But nowMr. Anderson was sure of his fate, so that there was no encouragement tohim to make any attempt at holding up his head. "I have come once moreto see you," he said."I am sure it gives mamma so much pleasure.""Mrs. Mountjoy is very kind. But it hasn't been for her. The truth is, Icouldn't settle down in this world without having another interview.""What am I to say, Mr. Anderson?""I'll just tell you how it all is. You know what my prospects are." Shedid not quite remember, but she bowed to him. "You must know, because Itold you. There is nothing I kept concealed." Again she bowed. "Therecan be no possible family reason for my going to Kamtchatka.""Kamtchatka!""Yes, indeed;--the F.O." (The F.O. always meant the Foreign Office.) "TheF.O. wants a young man on whom it can thoroughly depend to go toKamtchatka. The allowances are handsome enough, but the allowances arenothing to me.""Why should you go?""It is for you to decide. Yes, you can detain me. If I go to that bleakand barren desert, it will merely be to court exile from that quarter ofthe globe in which you and I would have to live together and notseparate. That I cannot stand. In Kamtchatka--Well, there is no knowingwhat may happen to me then.""But I'm engaged to be married to Mr. Annesley.""You told me something of that before.""But it's all fixed. Mamma will tell you. It's to be this day fortnight.If you'd only stay and come as one of my friends."Surely such a proposition as this is the unkindest that any young ladycan make; but we believe that it is made not unfrequently. In thepresent case it received no reply.Mr. Anderson took up his hat and rushed to the door. Then he returnedfor a moment. "God bless you, Miss Mountjoy!" he said. "In spite of thecruelty of that suggestion, I must bid God bless you." And then he wasgone. About a week afterward M. Grascour appeared upon the scene withprecisely the same intention. He, too, retained in his memory a mostvivid recollection of the young lady and her charms. He had heard thatCaptain Scarborough had inherited Tretton, and had been informed that itwas not probable that Miss Florence Mountjoy would marry her cousin. Hewas somewhat confused in his ideas, and thought, that were he now tore-appear on the scene there might still be a chance for him. There wasno lover more unlike Mr. Anderson than M. Grascour. Not even forFlorence Mountjoy, not even to own her, would he go to Kamtchatka; andwere he not to see her he would simply go back to Brussels. And yet heloved her as well as he knew how to love any one, and, would she havebecome his wife, would have treated her admirably. He had looked at itall round, and could see no reason why he should not marry her. Like apersevering man, he persevered; but as he did so, no glimmering of anidea of Kamtchatka disturbed him.But from this farther trouble Mrs. Mountjoy was able to save herdaughter. M. Grascour made his way into Mrs. Mountjoy's presence, andthere declared his purpose. He had been sent over on some questionconnected with the literature of commerce, and had ventured to take theopportunity of coming down to Cheltenham. He hoped that the truth of hisaffection would be evinced by the journey. Mrs. Mountjoy had observed,while he was making his little speech, how extremely well brushed washis hat. She had observed, also, that poor Mr. Anderson's hat was insuch a condition as almost to make her try to smooth it down for him."If you make objection to my hat, you should brush it yourself," she hadheard Harry say to Florence, and Florence had taken the hat, and hadbrushed it with fond, lingering touches."M. Grascour, I can assure you that she is really engaged," Mrs.Mountjoy had said. M. Grascour bowed and sighed. "She is to be marriedthis day week.""Indeed!""To Mr. Harry Annesley.""Oh-h-h! I remember the gentleman's name. I had thought--""Well, yes; there were objections, but they have luckily disappeared."Though Mrs. Mountjoy was only as yet happy in a melancholy manner,rejoicing with but bated joy at her girl's joys, she was too loyal tosay a word now against Harry Annesley."I should not have troubled you, but--""I am sure of that, M. Grascour; and we are both of us grateful to youfor your good opinion. I know very well how high is the honor which youare doing Florence, and she will quite understand it. But you see thething is fixed; it's only a week." Florence was said, at the moment, tobe not at home, though she was up-stairs, looking at four dozen newpocket-handkerchiefs which had just come from the pocket-handkerchiefmerchant, with the letters F.A. upon them. She had much more pleasure inlooking at them than she would have had in listening to thecongratulations of M. Grascour."He's a very good man, no doubt, mamma; a deal better, perhaps, thanHarry." That, however, was not her true opinion. "But one can't marryall the good men."There was almost more trouble taken down at Buston about Harry'smarriage than his sister's, though Harry was to be married atCheltenham; and only his father, and one of his sisters as a bride'smaid, were to go down to assist upon the occasion. His father was tomarry them. And his mother had at last consented to postpone the joy ofseeing Florence till she was brought home from her travels, a bridethree months old. Nevertheless, a great fuss was made, especially atBuston Hall. Mr. Prosper had become comparatively light in heart sincethe duty of providing a wife for Buston, and a future mother forBuston's heirs, had been taken off his shoulders and thrown upon thoseof his nephew. The more he looked back upon the days of his owncourtship the more did his own deliverance appear to him to be almost awork of Heaven. Where would he have been had Miss Thoroughbung made goodher footing in Buston Hall? He used to shut his eyes and gently raisehis left hand toward the skies as he told himself that this evil thinghad passed by him.But it had passed by, and it was expected that there should be a lunchof some sort at Buston; and as, with all his diligent inquiry, he hadheard nothing but good of Florence, she should be received with ashearty a welcome as he could give her. There was one point whichtroubled him more than all others. He was determined to refurnish thedrawing-room and also the bedroom in which Florence was destined tosleep. He told his sister in the most solemn manner that he had at lastmade up his mind thoroughly. The thing should be done. She understoodhow great a thing it was for him to do. "The two centre rooms!" he said,with an almost tragic air. Then he sent for her the next day, and toldher that, on farther considerations, he had determined to add in thedressing-room.The whole parish felt the effect. It was not so much that the parish wasstruck by the expenditure proposed,--because the squire was known to be aman who had not for years spent all his income,--but that he had givenway so far on behalf of a nephew whom he had lately been so anxious todisinherit. Rumor had already reached Buntingford of what the squire hadintended to do on the receipt of his own wife,--rumors which had ofcourse since faded away into nothing. It had been positively notified toBuntingford that there should be really a new carpet and new curtains inthe drawing-room. Miss Thoroughbung had been known to have declared atthe brewery that the whole thing should be done before she had beenthere twelve months."He shall go the whole hog," she had said. And there had been a littlebet about it between her and her brother, who entertained an idea thatMr. Prosper was an obstinate man. And Joe had brought tidings of the betto the parsonage, so that there had been much commotion on the subject.When the best room had been included, and then the dressing-room, evenMatthew had been alarmed. "It'll come to as much as five hundredpounds!" he had whispered to Mrs. Annesley. Matthew seemed to think thatit was quite time that there should be somebody to control his master."Why, ma'am, it's only the other day, because I can remember it myself,when that loo-table came into the house new!" Matthew had been in theplace over twenty years. When Mrs. Annesley reminded him that fashionswere changed, and that other kinds of table were required, he only shookhis head.But there was a question more vital than that of expense. How was thenew furniture to be chosen? The first idea was that Florence should beinvited to spend a week at her future home, and go up and down to Londonwith either Mrs. Annesley or her brother, and select the furnitureherself. But there were reasons against this. Mr. Prosper would like tosurprise her by the munificence of what he did. And the suggestion ofone day was sure to wane before the stronger lights of the next. Mr.Prosper, though he intended to be munificent, was still a little afraidthat it should be thrown away as a thing of course, or that it shouldappear to have been Harry's work. That would be manifestly unjust. "Ithink I had better do it myself," he said to his sister."Perhaps I could help you, Peter." He shuddered; but it was at thememory of the sound of the word "Peter," as it had been blurted out forhis express annoyance by Miss Thoroughbung. "I wouldn't mind going up toLondon with you." He shook his head, demanding still more time fordeliberation. Were he to accept his sister's offer he would be bound byhis acceptance. "It's the last drawing-room carpet I shall ever buy," hesaid to himself, with true melancholy, as he walked back home across thepark.Then there had been the other grand question of the journey, or not,down to Cheltenham. In a good-natured way Harry had told him that thewedding would be no wedding without his presence. That had moved himconsiderably. It was very desirable that the wedding should be more thana merely legal wedding. The world ought to be made aware that the heirto Buston had been married in the presence of the Squire of Buston. Butthe journey was a tremendous difficulty. If he could have gone fromBuston direct to Cheltenham it would have been comparatively easy. Buthe must pass through London, and to do this must travel the whole waybetween the Northern and Western railway-stations. And the trains wouldnot fit. He studied his Bradshaw for an entire morning and found thatthey would not fit. "Where am I to spend the hour and a quarter?" heasked his sister, mournfully. "And there would be four journeys, goingand coming,--four separate journeys!" And these would be irrespective ofnumerous carriages and cabs. It was absolutely impossible that he shouldbe present in the flesh on that happy day at Cheltenham. He was left athome for three months,--July, August, and September,--in which to buy thefurniture; which, however, was at last procured by Mr. Annesley.The marriage, as far as the wedding was concerned, was not nearly asgood fun as that of Joe and Molly. There was no Mr. Crabtree there, andno Miss Thoroughbung. And Mrs. Mountjoy, though she meant to do it allas well as it could be done, was still joyous only with bated joy. Sometinge of melancholy still clung to her. She had for so many yearsthought of her nephew as the husband destined for her girl, that shecould not be as yet demonstrative in her appreciation of Harry Annesley."I have no doubt we shall come to be true friends, Mr. Annesley," shehad said to him."Don't call me Mr. Annesley.""No, I won't, when you come back again and I am used to you. But atpresent there--there is a something--""A regret, perhaps?""Well, not quite a regret. I am an old-fashioned person, and I can'tchange my manners all at once. You know what it was that I used tohope.""Oh yes. But Florence was very stupid, and would have a differentopinion.""Of course I am happy now. Her happiness is all the world to me. Andthings have undergone a change.""That's true. Mr. Prosper has made over the marrying business to me, andI mean to go through it like a man. Only you must call me Harry." Thisshe promised to do, and did, in the seclusion of her room, give him akiss. But still her joy was not loud, and the hilarity of her guests wasmoderated. Mr. Annesley did his best, and the bridesmaids' dresseswere pretty,--which is all that is required of a bride's maid. Then atlast the father's carriage came, and they were carried away toGloucester, where they were committed to the untender, commonplace, butmuch more comfortable mercies of the railway-carriage. There we willpart with them, and encounter them again but for a few moments as, aftera long day's ramble, they made their way back to a solitary butcomfortable hotel among the Bernese Alps. Florence was on a pony, whichHarry had insisted on hiring for her, though Florence had declaredherself able to walk the whole way. It had been very hot, and she wasprobably glad of the pony. They both had alpenstocks in their hands, andon the pommel of her saddle hung the light jacket with which he hadstarted, and which had not been so light but that he had been glad toease himself of the weight. The guide was lagging behind, and they twowere close together. "Well, old girl!" he said, "and now what do youthink of it all?""I'm not so very much older than I was when you took me, pet.""Oh, yes, you are. Half of your life has gone; you have settled downinto the cares and duties of married life, none of which had been somuch as thought of when I took you.""Not thought of! They have been on my mind ever since that night at Mrs.Armitage's.""Only in a romantic and therefore untrue sort of manner. Since that timeyou have always thought of me with a white choker and dress-boots.""Don't flatter yourself; I never looked at your boots.""You knew that they were the boots and the clothes of a man making love,didn't you? I don't care personally very much about my own boots: Inever shall care about another pair; but I should care about them.Anything that might give me the slightest assistance.""Nothing was wanted; it had all been done, Harry.""My pet! But still a pair of high-lows heavy with nails would not havebeen efficacious then. I should think I love him, you might have said toyourself, but he is such an awkward fellow.""It had gone much beyond that at Mrs. Armitage's.""But now you have to take my high-lows as part of your duty.""And you?""When a man loves a woman he falls in love with everything belonging toher. You don't wear high-lows. Everything you possess as specially yourown has to administer to my sense of love and beauty.""I wish--I wish it might be so.""There is no danger about that at all. But I have to come before you onan occasion such as this as a kind of navvy,--and you must accept me."She glanced around furtively to see whether their guide was looking, butthe guide had gone back out of sight. For, sitting on her pony, she hadher arm around his neck and kissed him. "And then there is ever so muchmore," he continued. "I don't think I snore?""Indeed, no! There isn't a sound comes from you. I sometimes look to seeif I think you are alive.""But if I do, you'll have to put up with it. That would be one of yourduties as a wife. You never could have thought of that when I had thosedress-boots on.""Of course I didn't. How can you talk such rubbish?""I don't know whether it is rubbish. Those are the kind of things thatmust fall upon a woman so heavily. Suppose I were to beat you?""Beat me!""Yes;--hit you over the head with this stick!""I am sure you would not do that.""So am I. But suppose I were to? Your mother must be told of my leavingthat poor man bloody and speechless. What if I were to carry out myusual habits as then shown? Take care, my darling, or that brute'llthrow you!" This he said as the pony stumbled over a stone."Almost as unlikely as you are. One has to risk dangers in the world,but one makes the risk as little as possible. I know they won't give mea pony that will tumble down; and I know that I've told you to look tosee that they don't. You chose the pony, but I had to choose you. Idon't know very much about ponies, but I do know something about alover, and I know that I have got one that will suit me."***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MR.

It was a brilliant September night with a touch ofautumn vigor in the atmosphere, which had not been without its effect onthe company, who had driven off in gay spirits, most of them inhay-carts or other vehicles capable of carrying a party. Their songs andlaughter floated back along the winding country road. Selma, comfortablein her wraps and well tucked about with a rug, leaned back contentedlyin the chaise, after the goodbyes had been said, to enjoy the glamour ofthe full moon. They were seven miles from home and she was in no hurryto get there. Neither festivities nor the undisguised devotion of a cityyoung man were common in her life. Consideration she had been used tofrom a child, and she knew herself to be tacitly acknowledged thesmartest girl in Westfield, but perhaps for that very reason she hadheld aloof from manhood until now. At least no youth in her neighborhoodhad ever impressed her as her equal. Neither did Babcock so impress her;but he was different from the rest. He was not shy and unexpressive; hewas buoyant and self-reliant, and yet he seemed to appreciate herquality none the less.They had met about a dozen times, and on the last six of these occasionshe had come from Benham, ten miles to her uncle's farm, obviously tovisit her. The last two times her Aunt Farley had made him spend thenight, and it had been arranged that he would drive her in the Farleychaise to Clara Morse's wedding. A seven-mile drive is apt to promote orkill the germs of intimacy, and on the way over she had been consciousof enjoying herself. Scrutiny of Clara's choice had been to theadvantage of her own cavalier. The bridegroom had seemed to her what herAunt Farley would call a mouse-in-the-cheese young man. Whereas Babcockhad been the life of the affair.She had been teaching now in Wilton for more than a year. When, shortlyafter her father's death, she had obtained the position of schoolteacher, it seemed to her that at last the opportunity had come todisplay her capabilities, and at the same time to fulfil heraspirations. But the task of grounding a class of small children in therudiments of simple knowledge had already begun to pall and to seemunsatisfying. Was she to spend her life in this? And if not, the nextstep, unless it were marriage, was not obvious. Not that she mistrustedher ability to shine in any educational capacity, but neither Wilton northe neighboring Westfield offered better, and she was conscious of alack of influential friends in the greater world, which was embodied forher in Benham. Benham was a western city of these United States, with aneastern exposure; a growing, bustling city according to rumor, with aneager population restless with new ideas and stimulating ambitions. Soat least Selma thought of it, and though Boston and New York and a fewother places were accepted by her as authoritative, she accepted them,as she accepted Shakespeare, as a matter of course and so far removedfrom her immediate outlook as almost not to count. But Benham with itsseventy-five thousand inhabitants and independent ways was a fascinatingpossibility. Once established there the world seemed within her grasp,including Boston. Might it not be that Benham, in that it was newer, wasnearer to truth and more truly American than that famous city? She wasnot prepared to believe this an absurdity.At least the mental atmosphere of Westfield and even of the somewhatless solemn Wilton suggested this apotheosis of the adjacent city to bereasonable. Westfield had stood for Selma as a society of serious thoughsimple souls since she could first remember and had been one of them.Not that she arrogated to her small native town any unusual qualities ofsoul or mind in distinction from most other American communities, butshe regarded it as inferior in point of view to none, and typical of thebest national characteristics. She had probably never put into words thereasons of her confidence, but her daily consciousness was permeatedwith them. To be an American meant to be more keenly alive to theresponsibility of life than any other citizen of civilization, and to bean American woman meant to be something finer, cleverer, stronger, andpurer than any other daughter of Eve. Under the agreeable but soberinginfluence of this faith she had grown to womanhood, and the heroic deedsof the civil war had served to intensify a belief, the truth of whichshe had never heard questioned. Her mission in life had promptly beenrecognized by her as the development of her soul along individual lines,but until the necessity for a choice had arisen she had been content tocontemplate a little longer. Now the world was before her, for she wastwenty-three and singularly free from ties. Her mother had died when shewas a child. Her father, the physician of the surrounding country, a manof engaging energy with an empirical education and a speculative habitof mind, had been the companion of her girlhood. During the last fewyears since his return from the war an invalid from a wound, her carefor him had left her time for little else.No more was Babcock in haste to reach home; and after the preliminarydash from the door into the glorious night he suffered the farm-horse topursue its favorite gait, a deliberate jog. He knew the creature to bedocile, and that he could bestow his attention on his companion withoutperil to her. His own pulses were bounding. He was conscious of havingmade the whirligig of time pass merrily for the company by his spiritsand jolly quips, and that in her presence, and he was groping for anappropriate introduction to the avowal he had determined to make. Hewould never have a better opportunity than this, and it had been hispreconceived intention to take advantage of it if all went well. All hadgone well and he was going to try. She had been kind coming over; andhad seemed to listen with interest as he told her about himself: andsomehow he had felt less distant from her. He was not sure what shewould say, for he realized that she was above him. That was one reasonwhy he admired her so. She symbolized for him refinement, poetry, art,the things of the spirit--things from which in the same whirligig oftime he had hitherto been cut off by the vicissitudes of the varnishbusiness; but the value of which he was not blind to. How proud he wouldbe of such a wife! How he would strive and labor for her! His heart wasin his mouth and trembled on his lip as he thought of the possibility.What a joy to be sitting side by side with her under this splendid moon!He would speak and know his fate."Isn't it a lovely night?" murmured Selma appreciatively. "There theygo," she added, indicating the disappearance over the brow of a hill ofthe last of the line of vehicles of the rest of the party, whose songshad come back fainter and fainter."I don't care. Do you?" He snuggled toward her a very little."I guess they won't think I'm lost," she said, with a low laugh."What d'you suppose your folks would say if you _were_ lost? I mean if Iwere to run away with you and didn't bring you back?" There was anervous ring in the guffaw which concluded his question."My friends wouldn't miss me much; at least they'd soon get over theshock; but I might miss myself, Mr. Babcock."Selma was wondering why it was that she rather liked being alone withthis man, big enough, indeed, to play the monster, yet half school-boy,but a man who had done well in his calling. He must be capable; he couldgive her a home in Benham; and it was plain that he loved her."I'll tell you something," he said, eagerly, ignoring her suggestion."I'd like to run away with you and be married to-night, Selma. That'swhat I'd like, and I guess you won't. But it's the burning wish of myheart that you'd marry me some time. I want you to be my wife. I'm arough fellow along-side of you, Selma, but I'd do well by you; I would.I'm able to look after you, and you shall have all you want. There's anice little house building now in Benham. Say the word and I'll buy itfor us to-morrow. I'm crazy after you, Selma."The rein was dangling, and Babcock reached his left arm around the waistof his lady-love. He had now and again made the same demonstration withothers jauntily, but this was a different matter. She was not to betreated like other women. She was a goddess to him, even in his ardor,and he reached gingerly. Selma did not wholly withdraw from the spreadof his trembling arm, though this was the first man who had everventured to lay a finger on her."I'd have to give up my school," she said."They could get another teacher.""_Could_ they?""Not one like you. You see I'm clumsy, but I'm crazy for you, Selma."Emboldened by the obvious feebleness of her opposition, he broadened hisclutch and drew her toward him. "Say you will, sweetheart."This time she pulled herself free and sat up in the chaise. "Would youlet me do things?" she asked after a moment."Do things," faltered Babcock. What could she mean? She had told him onthe way over that her mother had chosen her name from a theatricalplaybill, and it passed through his unsophisticated brain that she mightbe thinking of the stage."Yes, do something worth while. Be somebody. I've had the idea I could,if I ever got the chance." Her hands were folded in her lap; there was awrapt expression on her thin, nervous face, and a glitter in her keeneyes, which were looking straight at the moon, as though they wouldoutstare it in brilliancy."You shall be anything you like, if you'll only marry me. What is ityou're wishing to be?""I don't know exactly. It isn't anything especial yet. It's the wholething. I thought I might find it in my school, but the experience so farhasn't been--satisfying.""Troublesome little brats!""No, I dare say the fault's in me. If I went to Benham to live it wouldbe different. Benham must be interesting--inspiring.""There's plenty of go there. You'd like it, and people would think lotsof you.""I'd try to make them." She turned and looked at him judicially, butwith a softened expression. Her profile in her exalted mood hadsuggested a beautiful, but worried archangel; her full face seemed lessthis and wore much of the seductive embarrassment of sex. To Babcock sheseemed the most entrancing being he had ever seen. "Would you reallylike to have me come?"He gave a hoarse ejaculation, and encircling her eagerly with his stronggrasp pressed his lips upon her cheek. "Selma! darling! angel! I'm thehappiest man alive.""You mustn't do that--yet," she said protestingly."Yes, I must; I'm yours, and you're mine,--mine. Aren't you, sweetheart?There's no harm in a kiss."She had to admit to herself that it was not very unpleasant after all tobe held in the embrace of a sturdy lover, though she had never intendedthat their relations should reach this stage of familiarity so promptly.She had known, of course, that girls were to look for endearments fromthose whom they promised to marry, but her person had hitherto been sosacred to man and to herself that it was difficult not to shrink alittle from what was taking place. This then was love, and love was, ofcourse, the sweetest thing in the world. That was one of the truthswhich she had accepted as she had accepted the beauty of Shakespeare, assomething not to be disputed, yet remote. He was a big, affectionatefellow, and she must make up her mind to kiss him. So she turned herface toward him and their lips met eagerly, forestalling the little peckwhich she had intended. She let her head fall back at his pressure on tohis shoulder, and gazed up at the moon."Are you happy, Selma?" he asked, giving her a fond, firm squeeze."Yes, Lewis."She could feel his frame throb with joy at the situation as she utteredhis name."We'll be married right away. That's if you're willing. My business isgoing first-rate and, if it keeps growing for the next year as it hasfor the past two, you'll be rich presently. When shall it be, Selma?""You're in dreadful haste. Well, I'll promise to give the selectmennotice to-morrow that they must find another teacher.""Because the one they have now is going to become Mrs. Lewis J. Babcock.I'm the luckiest fellow, hooray! in creation. See here," he added,taking her hand, "I guess a ring wouldn't look badly there--a realdiamond, too. Pretty little fingers."She sighed gently, by way of response. It was comfortable nestling inthe hollow of his shoulder, and a new delightful experience to behectored with sweetness in this way. How round and bountiful the moonlooked. She was tired of her present life. What was coming would bebetter. Her opportunity was at hand to show the world what she was madeof."A real diamond, and large at that," he repeated, gazing down at her,and then, as though the far away expression in her eyes suggestedkinship with the unseen and the eternal, he said, admiringly but humbly,"It must be grand to be clever like you, Selma. I'm no good at that. Butif loving you will make up for it, I'll go far, little woman.""What I know of that I like, and--and if some day, I can make you proudof me, so much the better," said Selma."Proud of you? You are an angel, and you know it."She closed her eyes and sighed again. Even the bright avenues of fame,which her keen eyes had traversed through the golden moon, paled beforethis tribute from the lips of real flesh and blood. What woman canwithstand the fascination of a lover's faith that she is an angel? If aman is fool enough to believe it, why undeceive him? And if he is sosure of it, may it even not be so? Selma was content to have it so,especially as the assertion did not jar with her own prepossessions; andthus they rode home in the summer night in the mutual contentment of abetrothal.CHAPTER II.The match was thoroughly agreeable to Mrs. Farley, Selma's aunt andnearest relation, who with her husband presided over a flourishingpoultry farm in Wilton. She was an easy-going, friendly spirit, with asharp but not wide vision, who did not believe that a likelier fellowthan Lewis Babcock would come wooing were her niece to wait a lifetime.He was hearty, comical, and generous, and was said to be making moneyfast in the varnish business. In short, he seemed to her an admirableyoung man, with a stock of common-sense and high spirits eminentlyserviceable for a domestic venture. How full of fun he was, to be sure!It did her good to behold the tribute his appetite paid to the buckwheatcakes with cream and other tempting viands she set before him--apleasing contrast to Selma's starveling diet--and the hearty smack withwhich he enforced his demands upon her own cheeks as his mother-in-lawapparent, argued an affectionate disposition. Burly, rosy-cheeked,good-natured, was he not the very man to dispel her niece's vagaries andturn the girl's morbid cleverness into healthy channels?Selma, therefore, found nothing but encouragement in her choice at home;so by the end of another three months they were made man and wife, andhad moved into that little house in Benham which had attracted Babcock'seye. Benham, as has been indicated, was in the throes of bustle andself-improvement. Before the war it had been essentially unimportant.But the building of a railroad through the town and the discovery of oilwells in its neighborhood had transformed it in a twinkling into anactive and spirited centre. Selma's new house was on the edge of thecity, in the van of real estate progress, one of a row of small butambitious-looking dwellings, over the dark yellow clapboards of whichthe architect had let his imagination run rampant in scrolls andflourishes. There was fancy colored glass in a sort of rose-window overthe front door, and lozenges of fancy glass here and there in thefacade. Each house had a little grass-plot, which Babcock in his casehad made appurtenant to a metal stag, which seemed to him the finishingtouch to a cosey and ornamental home. He had done his best and with allhis heart, and the future was before them.Babcock found himself radiant over the first experiences of marriedlife. It was just what he had hoped, only better. His imagination inentertaining an angel had not been unduly literal, and it was a constantdelight and source of congratulation to him to reflect over his pipe onthe lounge after supper that the charming piece of flesh and bloodsewing or reading demurely close by was the divinity of his domestichearth. There she was to smile at him when he came home at night andenable him to forget the cares and dross of the varnish business. Herpresence across the table added a new zest to every meal and improvedhis appetite. In marrying he had expected to cut loose from his bachelorhabits, and he asked for nothing better than to spend every eveningalone with Selma, varied by an occasional evening at the theatre, and adrive out to the Farleys' now and then for supper. This, with theregular Sunday service at Rev. Henry Glynn's church, rounded out theweeks to his perfect satisfaction. He was conscious of feeling that thesituation did not admit of improvement, for though, when he measuredhimself with Selma, Babcock was humble-minded, a cheerful and uncriticaloptimism was the ruling characteristic of his temperament. With health,business fortune, and love all on his side, it was natural to him toregard his lot with complacency. Especially as to all appearances, thiswas the sort of thing Selma liked, also. Presently, perhaps, there wouldbe a baby, and then their cup of domestic happiness would beoverflowing. Babcock's long ungratified yearning for the things of thespirit were fully met by these cosey evenings, which he would have beenglad to continue to the crack of doom. To smoke and sprawl and read alittle, and exchange chit-chat, was poetry enough for him. So contentedwas he that his joy was apt to find an outlet in ditties andwhistling--he possessed a slightly tuneful, rollicking knack at both--aproceeding which commonly culminated in his causing Selma to sit besidehim on the sofa and be made much of, to the detriment of her toilette.As for the bride, so dazing were the circumstances incident to thedouble change of matrimony and adaptation to city life, that herjudgment was in suspension. Yet though she smiled and sewed demurely,she was thinking. The yellow clapboarded house and metal stag, and amaid-of-all-work at her beck and call, were gratifying at the outset andmade demands upon her energies. Selma's position in her father's househad been chiefly ornamental and social. She had been his companion andnurse, had read to him and argued with him, but the mere household workhad been performed by an elderly female relative who recognized that hermind was bent on higher things. Nevertheless, she had never doubted thatwhen the time arrived to show her capacity as a housewife, she would bemore than equal to the emergency. Assuredly she would, for one of thedistinguishing traits of American womanhood was the ability to performadmirably with one's own hand many menial duties and yet be prepared toshine socially with the best. Still the experience was not quite so easyas she expected; even harassing and mortifying. Fortunately, Lewis wasmore particular about quantity than quality where the table wasconcerned; and, after all, food and domestic details were secondaryconsiderations in a noble outlook. It would have suited her never to beobliged to eat, and to be able to leave the care of the house to thehired girl; but that being out of the question, it became incumbent onher to make those obligations as simple as possible. However, thepossession of a new house and gay fittings was an agreeable realization.At home everything had been upholstered in black horse-hair, and regardfor material appearances had been obscured for her by the tension of herintrospective tendencies. Lewis was very kind, and she had no reason toreproach herself as yet for her choice. He had insisted that she shouldprovide herself with an ample and more stylish wardrobe, and though theinvitation had interested her but mildly, the effect of shrewdly-madeand neatly fitting garments on her figure had been a revelation. Likethe touch of a man's hand, fine raiment had seemed to her hithertoalmost repellant, but it was obvious now that anything which enhancedher effectiveness could not be dismissed as valueless. To arrive atdefinite conclusions in regard to her social surroundings was less easyfor Selma. Benham, in its rapid growth, had got beyond the levelsimplicity of Westfield and Wilton, and was already confronted by thestern realities which baffle the original ideal in every American city.We like as a nation to cherish the illusion that extremes of socialcondition do not exist even in our large communities, and that theplutocrat and the saleslady, the learned professions and the proletariatassociate on a common basis of equal virtue, intelligence, and culture.And yet, although Benham was a comparatively young and an essentiallyAmerican city, there were very marked differences in all these respectsin its community.Topographically speaking the starting point of Benham was itswater-course. Twenty years before the war Benham was merely a cluster offrame houses in the valley of the limpid, peaceful river Nye. At thattime the inhabitants drank of the Nye taken at a point below the town,for there was a high fall which would have made the drawing of waterabove less convenient. This they were doing when Selma came to Benham,although every man's hand had been raised against the Nye, which was thenearest, and hence for a community in hot haste, the most naturalreceptacle for dyestuffs, ashes and all the outflow from woollen mills,pork factories and oil yards, and it ran the color of glistening beansoup. From time to time, as the city grew, the drawing point had beenmade a little lower where the stream had regained a portion of itslimpidity, and no one but wiseacres and busybodies questioned itswholesomeness. Benham at that time was too preoccupied and too proud ofits increasing greatness to mistrust its own judgment in mattershygienic, artistic, and educational. There came a day later when theriver rose against the city, and an epidemic of typhoid fever convinceda reluctant community that there were some things which free-bornAmericans did not know intuitively. Then there were public meetings anda general indignation movement, and presently, under the guidance ofcompetent experts, Lake Mohunk, seven miles to the north, was secured asa reservoir. Just to show how the temper of the times has changed, andhow sophisticated in regard to hygienic matters some of the goodcitizens of Benham in these latter days have become, it is worthy ofmention that, though competent chemists declare Lake Mohunk to be freefrom contamination, there are those now who use so-called mineralspring-waters in preference; notably Miss Flagg, the daughter of oldJoel Flagg, once the miller and, at the date when the Babcocks set uptheir household gods, one of the oil magnates of Benham. He drank thebean colored Nye to the day of his death and died at eighty; but shecarries a carboy of spring-water with her personal baggage wherever shetravels, and is perpetually solicitous in regard to the presence ofarsenic in wall-papers into the bargain.Verily, the world has wagged apace in Benham since Selma first lookedout at her metal stag and the surrounding landscape. Ten years later theBenham Home Beautifying Society took in hand the Nye and those whodrained into it, and by means of garbage consumers, disinfectants, andfilters and judiciously arranged shrubbery converted its channel andbanks into quite a respectable citizens' paradise. But even at that timethe industries on either bank of the Nye, which flowed from east towest, were forcing the retail shops and the residences further andfurther away. To illustrate again from the Flagg family, just before thewar Joel Flagg built a modest house less than a quarter of a mile fromthe southerly bank of the river, expecting to end his days there, andwas accused by contemporary censors of an intention to seclude himselfin magnificent isolation. About this time he had yielded to the plea ofhis family, that every other building in the street had been given overto trade, and that they were stranded in a social Sahara of factories.So like the easy going yet soaring soul that he was, he had moved outtwo miles to what was known as the River Drive, where the Nyeaccomplishes a broad sweep to the south. There an ambitious importedarchitect, glad of such an opportunity to speculate in artistic effects,had built for him a conglomeration of a feudal castle and an oldcolonial mansion in all the grisly bulk of signal failure.Considering our ideals, it is a wonder that no one has provided a lawforbidding the erection of all the architecturally attractive, orsumptuous houses in one neighborhood. It ought not to be possible in arepublic for such a state of affairs to exist as existed in Benham. Thatis to say all the wealth and fashion of the city lay to the west ofCentral Avenue, which was so literally the dividing line that if aBenhamite were referred to as living on that street the conventionalinquiry would be "On which side?" And if the answer were "On the east,"the inquirer would be apt to say "Oh!" with a cold inflection whichsuggested a ban. No Benhamite has ever been able to explain preciselywhy it should be more creditable to live on one side of the same streetthan on the other, but I have been told by clever women, who were goodAmericans besides, that this is one of the subtle truths which bafflethe Gods and democracies alike. Central Avenue has long ago beenappropriated by the leading retail dry-goods shops, huge establishmentswhere everything from a set of drawing-room furniture to a hair-pin canbe bought under a single roof; but at that time it was the socialartery. Everything to the west was new and assertive; then came theshops and the business centre; and to the east were Tom, Dick, andHarry, Michael, Isaac and Pietro, the army of citizens who worked in themills, oil yards, and pork factories. And to the north, across theriver, on the further side of more manufacturing establishments, wasPoland, so-called--a settlement of the Poles--to reach whom now thereare seven bridges of iron. There were but two bridges then, one of wood,and journeys across them had not yet been revealed to philanthropicyoung women eager to do good.Selma's house lay well to the south-west of Central Avenue, far enoughremoved from the River Drive and the Flagg mansion to be humble and yetnear enough to be called looking up. Their row was complete and mainlyoccupied, but the locality was a-building, and in the process of makingacquaintance. So many strangers had come to Benham that even Babcockknew but few of their neighbors. Without formulating definitely how itwas to happen, Selma had expected to be received with open arms into asociety eager to recognize her salient qualities. But apparently, atfirst glance, everybody's interest was absorbed by the butcher andgrocer, the dressmaker and the domestic hearth. That is, the otherpeople in their row seemed to be content to do as they were doing. Thehusbands went to town every day--town which lay in the murkydistance--and their wives were friendly enough, but did not seem to beconscious either of voids in their own existence or of the privilege ofher society. To be sure, they dressed well and were suggestive in that,but they looked blank at some of her inquiries, and appeared to feeltheir days complete if, after the housework had been done and the battlefought with the hired girl, they were able to visit the shoppingdistrict and pore over fabrics, in case they could not buy them. Somewere evidently looking forward to the day when they might be sofortunate as to possess one of the larger houses of the district a mileaway, and figure among what they termed "society people." There wereothers who, in their satisfaction with this course of life, referredwith a touch of self-righteousness to the dwellers on the River Drive asdeserving reprobation on account of a lack of serious purpose. Thiscriticism appealed to Selma, and consoled her in a measure for the halfmortification with which she had begun to realize that she was not of somuch account as she had expected; at least, that there were people notvery far distant from her block who were different somehow from herneighbors, and who took part in social proceedings in which she and herhusband were not invited to participate. Manifestly they were unworthyand un-American. It was a comfort to come to this conclusion, eventhough her immediate surroundings, including the society of those whohad put the taunt into her thoughts, left her unsatisfied.Some relief was provided at last by her church. Babcock was by birth anEpiscopalian, though he had been lax in his interest during earlymanhood. This was one of the matters which he had expected marriage tocorrect, and he had taken up again, not merely with resignation butcomplacency, the custom of attending service regularly. Dr. White hadbeen a controversial Methodist, but since his wife's death, andespecially since the war, he had abstained from religious observances,and had argued himself somewhat far afield from the fold of orthodoxbelief. Consequently Selma, though she attended church at Westfield whenher father's ailments did not require her presence at home, had beenbrought up to exercise her faculties freely on problems of faith and tofeel herself a little more enlightened than the conventional worshipper.Still she was not averse to following her husband to the Rev. HenryGlynn's church. The experience was another revelation to her, forservice at Westfield had been eminently severe and unadorned. Mr. Glynnwas an Englishman; a short, stout, strenuous member of the Church ofEngland with a broad accent and a predilection for ritual, butenthusiastic and earnest. He had been tempted to cross the ocean by theopportunities for preaching the gospel to the heathen, and he had fixedon Benham as a vineyard where he could labor to advantage. His adventhad been a success. He had awakened interest by his fervor and by hismethods. The pew taken by Babcock was one of the last remaining, andthere was already talk of building a larger church to replace the chapelwhere he ministered. Choir boys, elaborate vestments, and genuflections,were novelties in the Protestant worship of Benham, and attracted theattention of many almost weary of plainer forms of worship, especiallyas these manifestations of color were effectively supplemented byevident sincerity of spirit on the part of their pastor. Nor were hisenergy and zeal confined to purely spiritual functions. The scope of hischurch work was practical and social. He had organized from thecongregation societies of various sorts to relieve the poor; Bibleclasses and evening reunions which the members of the parish were urgedto attend in order to become acquainted. Mr. Glynn's manner was bothhearty and pompous. To him there was no Church in the world but theChurch of England, and it was obvious that as one of the clergy of thatChurch he considered himself to be no mean man; but apart from thisserious intellectual foible with respect to his own relative importance,he was a stimulating Christian and citizen within his lights. Hisactive, crusading, and emotional temperament just suited the seethingpropensities of Benham.His flock comprised a few of the residents of the River Drive district,among them the Flaggs, but was a fairly representative mixture of allgrades of society, including the poorest. These last were specimensunder spiritual duress rather than free worshippers, and it was aconstant puzzle to the reverend gentleman why, in the matter ofattendance, they, metaphorically speaking, sickened and died. It hadnever been so in England. "Bonnets!" responded one day Mrs. HallettTaylor, who had become Mr. Glynn's leading ally in parish matters, andwas noted for her executive ability. She was an engaging butclear-headed soul who went straight to the point."I do not fathom your meaning," said the pastor, a little loftily, forthe suggestion sounded flippant."It hurts their feelings to go to a church where their clothes areshabby compared with those of the rest of the congregation.""Yes, but in God's chapel, dear lady, all such distinctions should beforgotten.""They can't forget, and I don't blame them much, poor things, do you?It's the free-born American spirit. There now, Mr. Glynn, you wereasking me yesterday to suggest some one for junior warden. Why not Mr.Babcock? They're new comers and seem available people."Mr. Glynn's distress at her first question was merged in the interestinspired by her second, for his glance had followed hers until it restedon the Babcocks, who had just entered the vestry to attend the socialreunion. Selma's face wore its worried archangel aspect. She was on hergood behavior and proudly on her guard against social impertinence. Butshe looked very pretty, and her compact, slight figure indicated a busyway."I will interrogate him," he answered. "I have observed them before,and--and I can't quite make out the wife. It is almost a spiritual face,and yet--""Just a little hard and keen," broke in Mrs. Taylor, upon hishesitation. "She is pretty, and she looks clever. I think we can getsome work out of her."Thereupon she sailed gracefully in the direction of Selma. Mrs. Taylorwas from Maryland. Her husband, a physician, had come to Benham at theclose of the war to build up a practice, and his wife had aided him byher energy and graciousness to make friends. Unlike some Southerners,she was not indolent, and yet she possessed all the ingratiating,spontaneous charm of well-bred women from that section of the country.Her tastes were aesthetic and ethical rather than intellectual, and herspecial interest at the moment was the welfare of the church. Shethought it desirable that all the elements of which the congregation wascomposed should be represented on the committees, and Selma seemed toher the most obviously available person from the class to which theBabcocks belonged."I want you to help us," she said. "I think you have ideas. We need awoman with sense and ideas on our committee to build the new church."Selma was not used to easy grace and sprightly spontaneity. It affectedher at first much as the touch of man; but just as in that instance theexperience was agreeable. Life was too serious a thing in her regard tolend itself casually to lightness, and yet she felt instinctivelyattracted by this lack of self-consciousness and self-restraint. Besideshere was an opportunity such as she had been yearning for. She had metMrs. Taylor before, and knew her to be the presiding genius of thecongregation; and it was evident that Mrs. Taylor had discovered hervalue."Thank you," she said, gravely, but cordially. "That is what I shouldlike. I wish to be of use. I shall be pleased to serve on thecommittee.""It will be interesting, I think. I have never helped build anythingbefore. Perhaps you have?""No," said Selma slowly. Her tone conveyed the impression that, thoughher abilities had never been put to that precise test, the employmentseemed easily within her capacity."Ah! I am sure you will be suggestive" said Mrs. Taylor. "I am rightanxious that it shall be a credit in an architectural way, you know."Mr. Glynn, who had followed with more measured tread, now mingled hishearty bass voice in the conversation. His mental attitude was friendly,but inquisitorial; as seemed to him to befit one charged with the cureof souls. He proceeded to ask questions, beginning with inquiriesconventional and domestic, but verging presently on points of faith.Babcock, to whom they were directly addressed, stood the ordeal well,revealing himself as flattered, contrite, and zealous to avail himselfof the blessings of the church. He admitted that lately he had been laxin his spiritual duties."We come every Sunday now," he said buoyantly, with a glance at Selma asthough to indicate that she deserved the credit of his reformation."The holy sacrament of marriage has led many souls from darkness intolight, from the flesh-pots of Egypt to the table of the Lord" Mr. Glynnanswered. "And you, my daughter," he added, meaningly, "guard well youradvantage."It was agreeable to Selma that the clergymen seemed to appreciate hersuperiority to her embarrassed husband, especially as she thought sheknew that in England women were not expected to have opinions of theirown. She wished to say something to impress him more distinctly with hercleverness, for though she was secretly contemptuous of his ceremonials,there was something impressive in his mandatory zeal. She came nearasking whether he held to the belief that it was wrong for a man tomarry his deceased wife's sister, which was the only proposition inrelation to the married state which occurred to her at the moment aslikely to show her independence, but she contented herself instead withsaying, with so much of Mrs. Taylor's spontaneity as she could reproducewithout practice, "We expect to be very happy in your church."Selma, however, supplemented her words with her tense spiritual look.She felt happier than she had for weeks, inasmuch as life seemed to beopening before her. For a few moments she listened to Mr. Glynn unfoldhis hopes in regard to the new church, trying to make him feel that shewas no common woman. She considered it a tribute to her when he tookLewis aside later and asked him to become a junior warden.CHAPTER III.At this time the necessity for special knowledge as to artistic oreducational matters was recognized grudgingly in Benham. Any reputablecitizen was considered capable to pass judgment on statues and pictures,design a house or public building, and prescribe courses of study forschool-children. Since then the free-born Benhamite, little by little,through wise legislation or public opinion, born of bitter experience,has been robbed of these prerogatives until, not long ago, theun-American and undemocratic proposition to take away the laying out ofthe new city park from the easy going but ignorant mercies of theso-called city forester, who had been first a plumber and later analderman, prevailed. An enlightened civic spirit triumphed and specialknowledge was invoked.That was twenty-five years later. Mrs. Hallett Taylor had found herselfalmost single-handed at the outset in her purpose to build the newchurch on artistic lines. Or rather the case should be stated thus:Everyone agreed that it was to be the most beautiful church in thecountry, consistent with the money, and no one doubted that it would be,especially as everyone except Mrs. Taylor felt that in confiding thematter to the leading architect in Benham the committee would beexercising a wise and intelligent discretion. Mr. Pierce, the individualsuggested, had never, until recently, employed the word architect inspeaking of himself, and he pronounced it, as did some of the committee,"arshitect," shying a little at the word, as though it were caviare andanything but American. He was a builder, practised by a brief butrushing career in erecting houses, banks, schools, and warehousesspeedily and boldly. He had been on the spot when the new growth ofBenham began, and his handiwork was writ large all over the city. Thecity was proud of him, and had, as it were, sniffed when Joel Flagg wentelsewhere for a man to build his new house. Surely, if it were necessaryto pay extra for that sort of thing, was not home talent good enough?Yet it must be confessed that the ugly splendor of the Flagg mediaevalcastle had so far dazed the eye of Benham that its "arshitect" had feltconstrained, in order to keep up with the times, to try fancy flights ofhis own. He had silenced any doubting Thomases by his latest effort, anew school-house, rich in rampant angles and scrolls, on the brown-stonefront of which the name _Flagg School_ appeared in ambitious, distortedhieroglyphics.Think what a wealth of imagery in the tossing of the second O on top ofthe L. If artistic novelty and genius were sought for the new church,here it was ready to be invoked. Besides, Mr. Pierce was abrother-in-law of one of the members of the committee, and, though thecommittee had the fear of God in their hearts in the erection of hissanctuary, it was not easy to protest against the near relative of afellow member, especially one so competent.The committee numbered seven. Selma had been chosen to fill a vacancycaused by death, but at the time of her selection the matter was stillin embryo, and the question of an architect had not been mooted. At thenext meeting discussion arose as to whether Mr. Pierce should be giventhe job, under the eagle eyes of a sub-committee, or Mrs. Taylor'sproject of inviting competitive designs should be adopted. It was knownthat Mr. Glynn, without meaning disrespect to Mr. Pierce, favored thelatter plan as more progressive, a word always attractive to Benham earswhen they had time to listen. Its potency, coupled with veneration, forthe pastor's opinion, had secured the vote of Mr. Clyme, a banker.Another member of the committee, a lawyer, favored Mrs. Taylor's ideabecause of a grudge against Mr. Pierce. The chairman and brother-in-law,and a hard-headed stove dealer, were opposed to the competitive plan ashighfalutin and unnecessary. Thus the deciding vote lay with Selma.Now that they were on the same committee, Mrs. Taylor could notaltogether make her out. She remembered that Mr. Glynn had said the samething. Mrs. Taylor was accustomed to conquests. Without actualpremeditation, she was agreeably conscious of being able to convert andsweep most opponents off their feet by the force of her pleasantpersonality. In this case the effect was not so obvious. She wasconscious that Selma's eyes were constantly fixed upon her, but as towhat she was thinking Mrs. Taylor felt less certain. Clearly she wasmesmerized, but was the tribute admiration or hostility? Mrs. Taylor waspiqued, and put upon her metal. Besides she needed Selma's vote. Notbeing skilled in psychological analyses, she had to resort to practicalmethods, and invited her to afternoon tea.Selma had never been present at afternoon tea as a domestic function inher life. Nor had she seen a home like Mrs. Taylor's. The house was nolarger than her own, and had cost less. Medicine had not been solucrative as the manufacture of varnish. Externally the house displayedstern lines of unadorned brick--the custom-made style of Benham in thefirst throes of expansion before Mr. Pierce's imagination had beenstirred. Mr. Taylor had bought it as it stood, and his wife had made noattempt to alter the outside, which was, after all, inoffensivelyhomely. But the interior was bewildering to Selma's gaze in itssuggestion of cosey comfort. Pretty, tasteful things, many of theminexpensive knick-knacks of foreign origin--a small picture, a bit ofchina, a mediaeval relic--were cleverly placed as a relief to theconventional furniture. Selma had been used to formalism in householdgarniture--to a best room little used and precise with the rigor of waxflowers and black horse-hair, and to a living room where the effectsought was purely utilitarian. Her new home, in spite of its coloredglass and iron stag, was arranged in much this fashion, as were thehouses of her neighbors which she had entered.Selma managed to seat herself on the one straight-backed chair in theroom. From this she was promptly driven by Mrs. Taylor and establishedin one corner of a lounge with a soft silk cushion behind her, andfurther propitiated by the proffer of a cup of tea in a dainty cup andsaucer. All this, including Mrs. Taylor's musical voice, easy speech,and ingratiating friendliness, alternately thrilled and irritated her.She would have liked to discard her hostess from her thought as a lightcreature unworthy of intellectual seriousness, but she found herselffascinated and even thawed in spite of herself."I'm glad to have the opportunity really to talk to you," said Mrs.Taylor. "At the church reunions one is so liable to interruptions. IfI'm not mistaken, you taught school before you were married?""For a short time.""That must have been interesting. It is so practical and definite. Mylife," she added deprecatingly, "has been a thing of threads andpatches--a bit here and a bit there."She paused, but without forcing a response, proceeded blithely to touchon her past by way of illustration. The war had come just when she wasgrown up, and her kin in Maryland were divided on the issue. Her fatherhad taken his family abroad, but her heart was in the keeping of a youngofficer on the Northern side--now her husband. Loss of property andbitterness of spirit had kept her parents expatriated, and she, withthem, had journeyed from place to place in Europe. She had seen manybeautiful places and beautiful things. At last Major Taylor had come forher and carried her off as his bride to take up again her life as anAmerican."I am interested in Benham," she continued, "and I count on you, Mrs.Babcock, to help make the new church what it ought to beartistically--worthy of all the energy and independence there is in thisplace."Selma's eye kindled. The allusion to foreign lands had aroused herdistrust, but this patriotic avowal warmed her pulses."Every one is so busy with private affairs here, owing to the rapidgrowth of the city," pursued Mrs. Taylor, "that there is danger of ourdoing inconsiderately things which cannot easily be set right hereafter.An ugly or tawdry-looking building may be an eyesore for a generation. Iknow that we have honest and skilful mechanics in Benham, but astrustees of the church funds, shouldn't we at least make the effort toget the best talent there is? If we have the cleverest architect here,so much the better. An open competition will enable us to find out.After all Benham is only one city among many, and a very new city. Whyshouldn't we take advantage of the ideas of the rest of the country--theolder portion of the country?""Mr. Pierce built our house, and we think it very satisfactory andpretty."Selma's tone was firm, but she eyed her hostess narrowly. She had begunof late to distrust the aesthetic worth of the colored glass and metalstag, and, though she was on her guard against effrontery, she wished toknow the truth. She knew that Mr. Pierce, with fine business instinct,had already conveyed to her husband the promise that he should furnishthe varnish for the new church in case of his own selection, which, asBabcock had remarked, would be a nice thing all round.Mrs. Taylor underwent the scrutiny without flinching. "I have nothing tosay against Mr. Pierce. He is capable within his lights. Indeed I thinkit quite possible that we shall get nothing more satisfactory elsewhere.Mr. Flagg's grim pile is anything but encouraging. That may sound likean argument against my plan, but in the case of the Flagg house therewas no competition; merely unenlightened choice on the one side andignorant experimenting on the other.""You don't seem to think very highly of the appearance of Benham," saidSelma. The remark was slightly interrogative, but was combative withal.She wished to know if everything, from the Flagg mansion down, was opento criticism, but she would fain question the authority of thecensor--this glib, graceful woman whose white, starched cuffs seemed tomake light of her own sober, unadorned wrists.This time Mrs. Taylor flushed faintly. She realized that their relationshad reached a critical point, and that the next step might be fatal. Sheput down her teacup, and leaning forward, said with smiling confidentialeagerness, "I don't. I wouldn't admit it to anyone else. But what's theuse of mincing matters with an intelligent woman like you? I might putyou off now, and declare that Benham is well enough. But you would soondivine what I really think, and that would be the end of confidencebetween us. I like honesty and frankness, and I can see that you do. Myopinion of Benham architecture is that it is slip-shod and mongrel.There! You see I put myself in your hands, but I do so because I feelsure you nearly agree with me already. You know it's so, but you hate toacknowledge it."Selma's eyes were bright with interest. She felt flattered by theappeal, and there was a righteous assurance in Mrs. Taylor's mannerwhich was convincing. She opened her mouth to say something--what shedid not quite know--but Mrs. Taylor raised her hand by way ofinterdiction."Don't answer yet. Let me show you what I mean. I'm as proud of Benhamas anyone. I am absorbed by the place, I look to see it fifty yearshence--perhaps less--a great city, and a beautiful city too. Just atpresent everything is commercial and--and ethical; yes, ethical. We wishto do and dare, but we haven't time to adorn as we construct. That is,most of us haven't. But if a few determined spirits--women though theybe--cry 'halt,' art may get a chance here and there to assert herself.Look at this," she said, gliding across the room and holding up a smallvase of exquisite shape and coloring, "I picked it up on the other sideand it stands almost for a lost art. The hands and taste which wroughtit represent the transmitted patience and skill of hundreds of years. Welike to rush things through in a few weeks on a design hastily conceivedby a Mr. Pierce because we are so earnest. Now, we won't do it thistime, will we?""No, we won't," said Selma. "I see what you mean. I was afraid at firstthat you didn't give us credit for the earnestness--for the ethicalpart. That's the first thing, the great thing according to my idea, andit's what distinguishes us from foreigners,--the foreigners who madethat vase, for instance. But I agree with you that there's such a thingas going too fast, and very likely some of the buildings here aren't allthey might be. We don't need to model them on foreign patterns, but wemust have them pretty and right.""Certainly, certainly, my dear. What we should strive for isoriginality--American originality; but soberly, slowly. Art is evolvedpainfully, little by little; it can't be bought ready-made at shops forthe asking like tea and sugar. If we invite designs for the new church,we shall give the youths of the country who have ideas seething in theirheads a chance to express themselves. Who knows but we may unearth agenius?""Who knows?" echoed Selma, with her spiritual look. "Yes, you are right,Mrs. Taylor. I will help you. As you say, there must be hundreds ofyoung men who would like to do just that sort of thing. I know myselfwhat it is to have lived in a small place without the opportunity toshow what one could do; to feel the capacity, but to be without themeans and occasion to reveal what is in one. And now that I understandwe really look at things the same way, I'm glad to join with you inmaking Benham beautiful. As you say, we women can do much if we onlywill. I've the greatest faith in woman's mission in this new,interesting nation of ours. Haven't you, Mrs. Taylor? Don't you believethat she, in her new sphere of usefulness, is one of the great movingforces of the Republic?" Selma was talking rapidly, and had lost everytrace of suspicious restraint. She spoke as one transfigured."Yes, indeed," answered Mrs. Taylor, checking any disposition she mayhave felt to interpose qualifications. She could acquiesce generallywithout violence to her convictions, and she could not afford to imperilthe safety of the immediate issue--her church. "I felt sure you wouldfeel so if you only had time to reflect," she added. "If you vote withus, you will have the pleasant consciousness of knowing that you haveadvanced woman's cause just so much.""You may count on my vote."Selma stopped on her way home, although it was late, to purchase somewhite cuffs. As she approached, her husband stood on the grass-plot inhis shirt sleeves with a garden-hose. He was whistling, and when he sawher he kissed his hand at her jubilantly,"Well, sweetheart, where you been?""Visiting. Taking tea with Mrs. Taylor. I've promised her to vote toinvite bids for the church plans."Babcock looked surprised. "That'll throw Pierce out, won't it?""Not unless some one else submits a better design than he."Lewis scratched his head. "I considered that order for varnish as goodas booked.""I'm not sure Mr. Pierce knows as much as he thinks he does," said Selmaoracularly. "We shall get plans from New York and Boston. If we don'tlike them we needn't take them. But that's the way to get an artisticthing. And we're going to have the most artistic church in Benham. I'msorry about the varnish, but a principle is involved."Babcock was puzzled but content. He cared far more for thedisappointment to Pierce than for the loss of the order. But apart fromthe business side of the question, he never doubted that his wife mustbe right, nor did he feel obliged to inquire what principle wasinvolved. He was pleased to have her associate with Mrs. Taylor, and wassatisfied that she would be a credit to him in any situation whereoccult questions of art or learning were mooted. He dropped his hose andpulled her down beside him on the porch settee. There was a beautifulsunset, and the atmosphere was soft and refreshing. Selma felt satisfiedwith herself. As Mrs. Taylor had said, it was her vote which would turnthe scale on behalf of progress. Other things, too, were in her mind.She was not ready to admit that she had been instructed, but she wasalready planning changes in her own domestic interior, suggested by whatshe had seen.She let her husband squeeze her hand, but her thoughts were wanderingfrom his blandishments. Presently she said: "Lewis, I've begun lately todoubt if that stag is really pretty.""The stag? Well, now, I've always thought it tasty--one of the featuresof our little place.""No one would mistake it for a real deer. It looks to me almostcomical."Babcock turned to regard judicially the object of her criticism."I like it," he said somewhat mournfully, as though he were puzzled."But if you don't, we'll change the stag for something else. I wish youto be pleased first of all. Instead we might have a fountain; twochildren under an umbrella I saw the other day. It was cute. How doesthat strike you?""I can't tell without seeing it. And, Lewis, promise me that you won'tselect anything new of that sort until I have looked at it.""Very well," Babcock answered submissively. But he continued to lookpuzzled. In his estimate of his wife's superiority to himself in thesubtleties of life, it had never occurred to him to include the choiceof every-day objects of art. He had eyes and could judge for himselflike any other American citizen. Still, he was only too glad to humorSelma in such an unimportant matter, especially as he was eager for herhappiness.CHAPTER IV.Seven designs for the new church were submitted, including three fromBenham architects. The leaven of influence exercised by spirits likeMrs. Taylor was only just beginning to work, and the now common customof competing outside one's own bailiwick was still in embryo. Mr.Pierce's design was bold and sumptuous. His brother-in-law statedoracularly not long before the day when the plans were to be opened:"Pierce is not a man to be frightened out of a job by frills. Mark mywords; he will give us an elegant thing." Mr. Pierce had conceived thehappy thought of combining a Moorish mosque and New Englandmeeting-house in a conservative and equitable medley, evidently hopingthereby to be both picturesque and traditional. The result, even onpaper, was too bold for some of his admirers. The chairman was heard toremark: "I shouldn't feel as though I was in church. That dome set amongspires is close to making a theatre of the house of God."The discomfiture of the first architect of Benham cleared the way forthe triumph of Mrs. Taylor's taste. The design submitted by WilburLittleton of New York, seemed to her decidedly the most meritorious. Itwas graceful, appropriate, and artistic; entirely in harmony withreligious associations, yet agreeably different from every daysanctuaries. The choice lay between his and that presented by Mr. Cass,a Benham builder--a matter-of-fact, serviceable, but very conventionaledifice. The hard-headed stove dealer on the committee declared in favorof the native design, as simpler and more solid."It'll be a massive structure" he said, "and when it's finished no onewill have to ask what it is. It'll speak for itself. Mr. Cass is a solidbusiness man, and we know what we'll get. The other plan is what I calldandified."It was evident to the committee that the stove dealer's final criticismcomprehended the architect as well as his design. Severalcompetitors--Littleton among them--had come in person to explain themerits of their respective drawings, and by the side of solid,red-bearded, undecorative Mr. Cass, Littleton may well have seemed adandy. He was a slim young man with a delicate, sensitive face andintelligent brown eyes. He looked eager and interesting. In his case thealmost gaunt American physiognomy was softened by a suggestion of poeticimpulses. Yet the heritage of nervous energy was apparent. Hisappearance conveyed the impression of quiet trigness and gentility. Hisfigure lent itself to his clothes, which were utterly inconspicuous,judged by metropolitan standards, but flawless in the face ofhard-headed theories of life, and aroused suspicion. He spoke in agentle but earnest manner, pointing out clearly, yet modestly, themerits of his composition.Selma had never seen a man just like him before, and she noticed thatfrom the outset his eyes seemed to be fastened on her as though hiswords were intended for her special benefit. She had never read thelines--indeed they had not been written--"I think I could be happy with a gentleman like you."Nor did the precise sentiment contained in them shape itself in herthought. Yet she was suddenly conscious that she had been starving forlack of intellectual companionship, and that he was the sort of man shehad hoped to meet--the sort of man who could appreciate her and whom shecould appreciate.It did not become necessary for Selma to act as Mr. Littleton'schampion, for the stove dealer's criticism found only one supporter. TheNew Yorker's design for the church was so obviously pretty and suitablethat a majority of the Committee promptly declared in its favor. Thesuccessful competitor, who had remained a day to learn the result, wassolemnly informed of the decision, and then elaborately introduced tothe members. In shaking hands with him, Selma experienced a shade ofembarrassment. It was plain that his words to her, spoken with a lowbow--"I am very much gratified that my work pleases you" conveyed a morespiritual significance than was contained in his thanks to the others.Still he seemed more at his ease with Mrs. Taylor, who promptly brokethe ice of the situation by fixing him as a close relative of friends inBaltimore. Straightway he became sprightly and voluble, speaking ofthings and people beyond Selma's experience. This social jargonirritated Selma. It seemed to her a profanation of a noble character,yet she was annoyed because she could not understand.Mrs. Taylor, having discovered in Mr. Littleton one who should have beena friend long before, succeeded in carrying him off to dinner. Yet,before taking his leave, he came back to Selma for a few words. She hadoverheard Mrs. Taylor's invitation, and she asked herself why she toomight not become better acquainted with this young man whose attitudetoward her was that of respectful admiration. To have a strange youngman to dine off-hand struck her as novel. She had a general convictionthat it would seem to Lewis closely allied to light conduct, and thatonly foreigners or frivolous people let down to this extent the bars offamily life. Now that Mrs. Taylor had set her the example, she was lesscertain of the moral turpitude of such an act, but she concluded alsothat her husband would be in the way at table. What she desired was anopportunity for a long, interesting chat about high things.While she reflected, he was saying to her, "I understand that yourcommittee is to supervise my work until the new church is completed, soI shall hope to have the opportunity to meet you occasionally. It willbe necessary for me to make trips here from time to time to see thateverything is being done correctly by the mechanics.""Do you go away immediately?""It may be that I shall be detained by the arrangements which I mustmake here until day after to-morrow.""If you would really like to see me, I live at 25 Onslow Avenue.""Thank you very much." Littleton took out a small memorandum book andcarefully noted the address. "Mrs. Babcock, 25 Onslow Avenue. I shallmake a point of calling to-morrow afternoon if I stay--and probably Ishall."He bowed and left Selma pleasantly stirred by the interview. His voicewas low and his enunciation sympathetically fluent. She said to herselfthat she would give him afternoon tea and they would compare ideastogether. She felt sure that his must be interesting.Later in the evening at Mrs. Taylor's, when there was a pause in theirsympathetic interchange of social and aesthetic convictions, Littletonsaid abruptly:"Tell me something, please, about Mrs. Babcock. She has a suggestive aswell as a beautiful face, and it is easy to perceive that she isgenuinely American--not one of the women of whom we were speaking, whoseem to be ashamed of their own institutions, and who ape foreignmanners and customs. I fancy she would illustrate what I was saying justnow as to the vital importance of our clinging to our heritage ofindependent thought--of accepting the truth of the ancient order ofthings without allowing its lies and demerits to enslave us.""I suppose so," said Mrs. Taylor. "She certainly does not belong to thedangerous class of whom you were speaking. I was flattering myself thatneither did I, for I was agreeing with all you said as to the need ofcherishing our native originality. Yet I must confess that now that youcompare me with her (the actual comparison is my own, but you instigatedit), I begin to feel more doubts about myself--that is if she is thetrue species, and I'm inclined to think she is. Pray excuse thisindirect method of answering your inquiry; it is in the nature of asoliloquy; it is an airing of thoughts and doubts which have beenharassing me for a fortnight--ever since I knew Mrs. Babcock. Really,Mr. Littleton, I can tell you very little about her. She is a new-comeron the horizon of Benham; she has been married very recently; I believeshe has taught school and that she was brought up not far from here. Sheis as proud as Lucifer and sometimes as beautiful; she is profoundlyserious and--and apparently very ignorant. I fancy she is clever andcapable in her way, but I admit she is an enigma to me and that I havenot solved it. I can see she does not approve of me altogether. Sheregards me with suspicion, and yet she threw the casting vote in favorof my proposal to open the competition for the church to architects fromother places. I am trying to like her, for I wish to believe ineverything genuinely American if I can. There, I have told you all Iknow, and to a man she may seem altogether attractive and inspiring.""Thank you. I had no conception that I was broaching such a complexsubject. She sounds interesting, and my curiosity is whetted. You havenot mentioned the husband.""To be sure. A burly, easy-going manufacturer of varnish, without mucheducation, I should judge. He is manifestly her inferior in half a dozenways, but I understand that he is making money, and he looks kind."Wilbur Littleton's life since he had come to man's estate had been astruggle, and he was only just beginning to make headway. He had neverhad time to commiserate himself, for necessity on the one hand andyouthful ambition on the other had kept his energies tense and histhoughts sane and hopeful. He and his sister Pauline, a year his senior,had been left orphans while both were students by the death of theirfather on the battlefield. To persevere in their respective tastes andwork out their educations had been a labor of love, but an undertakingwhich demanded rigorous self-denial on the part of each. Wilbur haddetermined to become an architect. Pauline, early interested in thedogma that woman must no longer be barred from intellectualcompanionship with man, had sought to cultivate herself intelligentlywithout sacrificing her brother's domestic comfort. She had succeeded.Their home in New York, despite its small dimensions and frugalhospitality, was already a favorite resort of a little group ofprofessional people with busy brains and light purses. Wilbur was in thethroes of early progress. He had no relatives or influential friends togive him business, and employment came slowly. He had been an architecton his own account for two years, but was still obliged to supplementhis professional orders by work as a draughtsman for others. Yet hisenthusiasm kept him buoyant. In respect to his own work he wasscrupulous; indeed, a stern critic. He abhorred claptrap and speciouseffects, and aimed at high standards of artistic expression. This gavehim position among his brother architects, but was incompatible withmeteoric progress. His design for the church at Benham represented muchthought and hope, and he felt happy at his success.Littleton's familiarity with women, apart from his sister, had beenslight, but his thoughts regarding them were in keeping with a poeticand aspiring nature. He hoped to marry some day, and he was fond ofpicturing to himself in moments of reverie the sort of woman to whom hisheart would be given. In the shrine of his secret fancy she appearedprimarily as an object of reverence, a white-souled angel of light cladin the graceful outlines of flesh, an Amazon and yet a winsome, tenderspirit, and above all a being imbued with the stimulating intellectualindependence he had been taught to associate with American womanhood.She would be the loving wife of his bosom and the intelligent sharer ofhis thoughts and aspirations--often their guide. So pure and exactingwas his ideal that while alive to the value of coyness and coquetry aselements of feminine attraction for others, Wilbur had chosen to regardthe maiden of his faith as too serious a spirit to condescend to suchvanities; and from a similar vein of appreciation he was prone to thinkof her as unadorned, or rather untarnished, by the gewgaws offashionable dressmaking and millinery. His first sight of Selma had madehim conscious that here was a face not unlike what he had hoped toencounter some day, and he had instinctively felt her to be sympathetic.He was even conscious of disappointment when he heard her addressed asMrs. Babcock. Evidently she was a free-born soul, unhampered by thesocial weaknesses of a large city, and illumined by the spiritual graceof native womanliness. So he thought of her, and Mrs. Taylor's diagnosisrather confirmed than impaired his impression, for in Mrs. Taylor Wilburfelt he discerned a trace of antagonism born of cosmopolitanprejudice--an inability to value at its true worth a nature not mouldedon conventional lines. Rigorous as he was in his judgments, and eager todisown what was cheap or shallow, mere conventionalism, whether in artor daily life, was no less abhorrent to him. Here, he said to himself,was an original soul, ignorant and unenlightened perhaps, but endowedwith swift perception and capable of noble development.The appearance of Selma's scroll and glass bedizened house did notaffect this impression. Wilbur was first of all appreciatively anAmerican. That is he recognized that native energy had hitherto beenexpended on the things of the spirit to the neglect of things material.As an artist he was supremely interested in awakening and guiding thenational taste in respect to art, but at the same time he was thoroughlyaware that the peculiar vigor and independence of character which heknew as Americanism was often utterly indifferent to, or ignorant of,the value of aesthetics. After all, art was a secondary consideration,whereas the inward vision which absorbed the attention of the thoughtfulamong his countrymen and countrywomen was an absolute essential withoutwhich the soul must lose its fineness. He himself was seeking to showthat beauty, in external material expression, was not merely consistentwith strong ideals but requisite to their fit presentment. He recognizedtoo that the various and variegated departures from the monotonoushomely pattern of the every-day American house, which were evident ineach live town, were but so many indicators that the nation wasbeginning to realize the truth of this. His battle was with thedesigners and builders who were guiding falsely and flamboyantly, notwith the deceived victims, nor with those who were still satisfiedmerely to look inwardly, and ignored form and color. Hence he would havebeen able to behold the Babcocks' iron stag without rancor had theanimal still occupied the grass-plot. Selma, when she saw the figure ofher visitor in the door-way, congratulated herself that it had beenremoved. It would have pleased her to know that Mr. Littleton hadalready placed her in a niche above the level of mere grass-plotconsiderations. That was where she belonged of course; but she wasfearful on the score of suspected shortcomings. So it was gratifying tobe able to receive him in a smarter gown, to be wearing white cuffs, andto offer him tea with a touch of Mrs. Taylor's tormenting urbanity. Notso unreservedly as she. That would never do. It was and never would bein keeping with her own ideas of serious self-respect. Still a touch ofit was grateful to herself. She felt that it was a grace and enhancedher effectiveness.A few moments later Selma realized that for the first time since she hadlived in Benham she was being understood and appreciated. She felt toothat for the first time she was talking to a kindred spirit--to be sure,to one different, and more technically proficient in concrete knowledge,possibly more able, too, to express his thoughts in words, but eminentlya comrade and sympathizer. She was not obliged to say much. Nor were,indeed, his actual words the source of her realization. The revelationcame from what was left unsaid--from the silent recognition by him thatshe was worthy to share his best thoughts and was herself a seriousworker in the struggle of life. No graceful but galling attitude ofsuperiority, no polite indifference to her soul-hunger, no dispositionto criticise. And yet he was no less voluble, clever, and spirited thanMrs. Taylor. She listened with wrapt interest to his easy talk, whichwas ever grave in tone, despite his pleasant sallies. He spoke of Benhamwith quick appreciation of its bustling energy, and let her see that hedivined its capacity for greatness. This led him to refer with kindlingeyes to the keen impulse toward education and culture which wasanimating the younger men and women of the country; to the newbeginnings of art, literature, and scientific investigation. At scarcelya hint from her he told briefly of his past life and his hopes, andfondly mentioned his sister and her present absorption in some historycourses for women."And you?" he said. "You are a student, too. Mrs. Taylor has told me,but I should have guessed it. Duties even more interesting claim younow, but it is easy to perceive that you have known that otherhappiness, 'To scorn delights and live laborious days.'"His words sounded musical, though the quotation from Lycidas wasunfamiliar to her ears. Her brain was thrilling with the import of allhe had told her--with his allusions to the intellectual and ethicalmovements of Boston and New York, in which she felt herself by right andwith his recognition a partner and peer."You were teaching school when you married, I believe?" he added."Yes.""And before that, if I may ask?""I lived at Westfield with my father. It is a small country town, but wetried to be in earnest.""I understand--I understand. You grew up among the trees, and thebreezes and the brooks, those wonderful wordless teachers. I envy you,for they give one time to think--to expand. I have known only city lifemyself. It is stimulating, but one is so easily turned aside from one'sdirect purpose. Do you write at all?""Not yet. But I have wished to. Some day I shall. Just now I have toomany domestic concerns to--"She did not finish, for Babcock's heavy tread and whistle resounded inthe hall and at the next moment he was calling "Selma!"She felt annoyed at being interrupted, but she divined that it wouldnever do to show it."My husband," she said, and she raised her voice to utter with a sugareddignity which would have done credit to Mrs. Taylor,"I am in the parlor, Lewis.""Enter your chief domestic concern," said Littleton blithely. "A happyhome is preferable to all the poems and novels in the world."Babcock, pushing open the door, which stood ajar, stopped short in hismelody."This is Mr. Littleton, Lewis. The architect of our new church.""Pleased to make your acquaintance." And by way of accounting for thesudden softening of his brow, Babcock added, "I set you down at first asone of those lightning-rod agents. There was one here last week whowouldn't take 'no' for an answer.""He has an advantage over me," answered Littleton with a laugh. "In mybusiness a man can't solicit orders. He has to sit and wait for them tocome to him.""I want to know. My wife thinks a lot of your drawings for the newchurch.""I hope to make it a credit to your city. I've just been saying to yourwife, Mr. Babcock, that Benham has a fine future before it. The veryatmosphere seems charged with progress."Babcock beamed approvingly. "It's a driving place, sir. The man inBenham who stops by the way-side to scratch his head gets left behind.When we moved into this house a year ago looking through that window wewere at the jumping-off place; now you see houses cropping up in everydirection. It's going to be a big city. Pleased to have you stop tosupper with us," he added with burly suavity as their visitor rose.Littleton excused himself and took his leave. Babcock escorted him tothe front door and full of his subject delayed him on the porch to touchonce more on the greatness of Benham. There was a clumsy method too inthis optimistic garrulity, for at the close he referred with some prideto his own business career, and made a tender of his business card,"Lewis Babcock & Company, Varnishes," with a flourish. "If you doanything in my line, pleased to accommodate you."Littleton departing, tickled by a pleasant sense of humor, caughtthrough the parlor window a last glimpse of Selma's inspired face bowinggravely, yet wistfully, in acknowledgment of his lifted hat, and hestrode away under the spell of a brain picture which he transmuted intowords: "There's the sort of case where the cynical foreigner fails toappreciate the true import of our American life. That couple typifiesthe elements of greatness in our every-day people. At first blush thehusband's rough and material, but he's shrewd and enterprising andvigorous--the bread winner. He's enormously proud of her, and he hasreason to be, for she is a constant stimulus to higher things. Little bylittle, and without his knowing it, perhaps, she will smoothe andelevate him, and they will develop together, growing in intelligence andcultivation as they wax in worldly goods. After all, woman is our mostmarvellous native product--that sort of woman. Heigho!" Having givenvent to this sigh, Littleton proceeded to recognize the hopelessness ofthe personal situation by murmuring with a slightly forced access ofsprightliness     "If she be not fair for me,     What care I how fair she be?"Still he intended to see more of Mrs. Babcock, and that withoutinfringing the tenth or any other commandment. To flirt with a marriedwoman savored to him of things un-American and unworthy, and Littletonhad much too healthy an imagination to rhapsodize from such astand-point. Yet he foresaw that they might be mutually respectingfriends.CHAPTER V.Selma knew intuitively that an American woman was able to cook a smoothcustard, write a poem and control real society with one and the samebrain and hand, and she was looking forward to the realization of theapotheosis; but, though she was aware that children are the naturalincrement of wedlock, she had put the idea from her ever since hermarriage as impersonal and vaguely disgusting. Consequently herconfinement came as an unwelcome interruption of her occupations andplans.Her connection with the committee for the new church had proved anintroduction to other interests, charitable and social. One day she wastaken by Mrs. Taylor to a meeting of the Benham Woman's Institute, aliterary club recently established by Mrs. Margaret Rodney Earle, aWestern newspaper woman who had made her home in Benham. Selma came inupon some twenty of her own sex in a hotel private parlor hired weeklyfor the uses of the Institute. Mrs. Earle, the president, a large floridwoman of fifty, with gray hair rising from the brow, fluent of speech,endowed with a public manner, a commanding bust and a vigorous,ingratiating smile, wielded a gavel at a little table and directed theexercises. A paper on Shakespeare's heroines was read and discussed.Selections on the piano followed. A thin woman in eye-glasses, theliterary editor of the _Benham Sentinel_, recited "Curfew must not ringto-night," and a visitor from Wisconsin gave an exhibition in melodiouswhistling. In the intervals, tea, chocolate with whipped cream andlittle cakes were dispensed.Selma was absorbed and thrilled. What could be more to her taste thanthis? At the close of the whistling exercise, Mrs. Earle came over andspoke to her. They took a strong fancy to each other on the spot. Selmapreferred a person who would tell you everything about herself and towhom you could tell everything about yourself without preliminaries.People like Mrs. Taylor repressed her, but the motherly loquacity andcomprehension of Mrs. Earle drew her out and thawed at once and foreverthe ice of acquaintanceship. Before she quite realized the extent ofthis fascination she had promised to recite something, and as in adream, but with flushing cheeks, she heard the President rap the tableand announce "You will be gratified to hear that a talented friend whois with us has kindly consented to favor us with a recital. I have thehonor to introduce Mrs. Lewis Babcock."After the first flush of nervousness, Selma's grave dignity came to hersupport, and justified her completely in her own eyes. Her father hadbeen fond of verse, especially of verse imbued with moral melancholy,and at his suggestion she had learned and had been wont to repeat manyof the occasional pieces which he cut from the newspapers and collectedin a scrap-book. Her own preference among these was the poem, "O whyshould the spirit of mortal be proud?" which she had been told was agreat favorite of Abraham Lincoln. It was this piece which came into hermind when Mrs. Earle broached the subject, and this she proceeded todeliver with august precision. She spoke clearly and solemnly withoutthe trace of the giggling protestation which is so often incident tofeminine diffidence. She treated the opportunity with the seriousnessexpected, for though the Institute was not proof against light anddiverting contributions, as the whistling performance indicated, levityof spirit would have been out of place.     "'Tis a twink of the eye, 'tis a draught of the breath     From the blossom of health to the paleness of death;     From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud,     O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?"Selma enjoyed the harmony between the long, slow cadence of the metreand the important gravity of the theme. She rolled out the verses withthe intensity of a seer, and she looked a beautiful seer as well.Liberal applause greeted her as she sat down, though the clapping womanis apt to be a feeble instrument at best. Selma knew that she hadproduced an impression and she was moved by her own effectiveness. Shewas compelled to swallow once or twice to conceal the tears in her voicewhile listening to the congratulations of Mrs. Earle. The words whichshe had just recited were ringing through her brain and seemed to her toexpress the pitch at which her life was keyed.Selma was chosen a member of the Institute at the next meeting, andforthwith she became intimate with the president. Mrs. Margaret RodneyEarle was, as she herself phrased it, a live woman. She supportedherself by writing for the newspapers articles of a morally utilitariancharacter--for instance a winter's series, published every Saturday,"Hints on Health and Culture," or again, "Receipts for the Parlor andthe Kitchen." She also contributed poetry of a pensive cast, and chattyspecial correspondence flavored with personal allusion. She was one ofthe pioneers in modern society journalism, which at this time, however,was comparatively veiled and delicate in its methods. Besides, she was awoman of tireless energy, with theories on many subjects and an ardorfor organization. She advocated prohibition, the free suffrage of woman,the renunciation of corsets, and was interested in reforms relating tolabor, the pauper classes and the public schools. In behalf of any ofthese causes she was ready from time to time to dash off an article atshort notice or address an audience. But her dearest concern was thepromotion of woman's culture and the enlargement of woman's sphere ofusefulness through the club. The idea of the woman's club, which wastaking root over the country, had put in the shade for the time beingall her other plans, including the scheme of a society for making thegolden-rod the national flower. As the founder and president of theBenham Institute, she felt that she had found an avocation peculiarlyadapted to her capacities, and she was already actively incorrespondence with clubs of a similar character in other cities, in thehope of forming a national organization for mutual enlightenment andsupport.Mrs. Earle received Selma by invitation at her lodgings the followingday, and so quickly did their friendship ripen that at the end of twohours each had told the other everything. Selma was prone instinctivelyto regard as aristocratic and un-American any limitations to confidence.The evident disposition on the part of Mrs. Earle to expose promptly andwithout reserve the facts of her past and her plans for the futureseemed to Selma typical of an interesting character, and she wasthankful to make a clean breast in her turn as far as was possible. Mrs.Earle's domestic experience had been thorny."I had a home once, too," she said, "a happy home, I thought. My husbandsaid he loved me. But almost from the first we had trouble. It went onso from month to month, and finally we agreed to part. He objected, mydear, to my living my own life. He didn't like me to take an interest inthings outside the house--public matters. I was elected on theschool-board--the only woman--and he ought to have been proud. He saidhe was, at first, but he was too fond of declaring that a woman's placeis in her kitchen. One day I said to him, 'Ellery, this can't go on. Ifwe can't agree we'd better separate. A cat-and-dog life is no life atall.' He answered back, 'I'm not asking you to leave me, but if you'reset on it don't let me hinder you, Margaret. You don't need a man tosupport you. You're as good as a man yourself.' He meant that to besarcastic, I suppose. 'Yes,' said I, 'thank God, I think I can take careof myself, even though I am a woman.' That was the end of it. There wasno use for either of us to get excited. I packed my things, and a fewmornings later I said to him, 'Good-by, Ellery Earle: I wish you well,and I suppose you're my husband still, but I'm going to live my own lifewithout let or hindrance from any man. There's your ring.' My holdingout the ring was startling to him, for he said, 'Aren't you going to besorry for this, Margaret?' 'No,' said I, 'I've thought it all out, andit's best for both of us. There's your ring.' He wouldn't take it, so Idropped it on the table and went out. Some people miss it, andmisbelieve I was ever married. That was close on to twenty years ago,and I've never seen him since. When the war broke out I heard heenlisted, but what's become of him I don't know. Maybe he got a divorce.I've kept right on and lived my own life in my own way, and never lackedfood or raiment. I'm forty-five years old, but I feel a young womanstill."Notwithstanding Mrs. Earle's business-like directness and theprotuberance of her bust in conclusion, by way of reasserting hersatisfaction with the results of her action, there was a touch ofplaintiveness in her confession which suggested the womanly author of"Hints on Culture and Hygiene," rather than the man-hater. This was loston Selma, who was fain to sympathize purely from the stand-point ofrighteousness."It was splendid," she said. "He had no right to prevent you living yourown life. No husband has that right."Mrs. Earle brushed her eyes with her handkerchief. "You musn't think, mydear, that I'm not a believer in the home because mine has beenunhappy--because my husband didn't or couldn't understand. The true homeis the inspirer and nourisher of all that is best in life--in ourAmerican life; but men must learn the new lesson. There are manyhomes--yours, I'm sure--where the free-born American woman hasencouragement and the opportunity to expand.""Oh, yes. My husband lets me do as I wish. I made him promise before Iaccepted him that he wouldn't thwart me; that he'd let me live my ownlife."Selma was so appreciative of Mrs. Earle, and so energetic and suggestivein regard to the scope of the Institute, that she was presently chosen amember of the council, which was the body charged with the supervisionof the fortnightly entertainments. It occurred to her as a brilliantconception to have Littleton address the club on "Art," and she broachedthe subject to him when he next returned to Benham and appeared beforethe church committee. He declared that he was too busy to prepare asuitable lecture, but he yielded finally to her plea that he owed it tohimself to let the women of Benham hear his views and opinions."They are wives and they are mothers," said Selma sententiously. "It wasa woman's vote, you remember, which elected you to build our church. Youowe it to Art; don't you think so?"A logical appeal to his conscience was never lost on Littleton. Besideshe was glad to oblige Mrs. Babcock, who seemed so earnest in her desireto improve the aesthetic taste of Benham. Accordingly, he yielded. Thelecture was delivered a few weeks later and was a marked success, forLittleton's earnestness of theme and manner was relieved by a graceful,sympathetic delivery. Selma, whose social aplomb was increasing everyday, glided about the rooms with a contented mien receivingfelicitations and passing chocolate. She enjoyed the distinction ofbeing the God behind the curtain.A few days later the knowledge that she herself was to become a motherwas forced upon her attention, and was a little irksome. Of necessityher new interests would be interrupted. Though she did not question thatshe would perform maternal duties fitly and fully, they seemed to herless peculiarly adapted to her than concerns of the intellect and thespirit. However, the possession of a little daughter was more preciousto her than she had expected, and the consciousness that the tiny dollwhich lay upon her breast, was flesh of her flesh and bone of her boneaffected her agreeably and stirred her imagination. It should be reared,from the start, in the creed of soul independence and expansion, and sheherself would find a new and sacred duty in catering to the needs ofthis budding intelligence. So she reflected as she lay in bed, but theoutlook was a little marred by the thought that the baby was the livingimage of its father--broad-featured and burly--not altogether desirablecast of countenance for a girl. What a pity, when it might just as wellhave looked like her.Babcock, on his part, was transported by paternity. He was bubbling overwith appreciation of the new baby, and fondly believed it to be a humanwonder. He was solicitous on the score of its infantile ailments, andloaded it with gifts and toys beyond the scope of its enjoyment. He wentabout the house whistling more exuberantly than ever. There was no speckon his horizon; no fly in his pot of ointment. It was he who urged thatthe child should be christened promptly, though Dr. Glynn was notdisposed to dwell on the clerical barbarism as to the destiny ofunbaptized infants. Babcock was cultivating a conservative method: Herealized that there was no object in taking chances. Illogical as wasthe theory that a healthy dog which had bitten him should be killed atonce, lest it subsequently go mad and he contract hydrophobia, he wastoo happy and complacent to run the risk of letting it live. So it waswith regard to baby. But Selma chose the name. Babcock preferred in thisorder another Selma, Sophia, after his mother, or a compliment to thewife of the President of the United States. But Selma, as the result ofgrave thought, selected Muriel Grace. Without knowing exactly why, sheasked Mrs. Taylor to be godmother. The ceremony was solemn and inspiringto her. She knew from the glass in her room that she was looking verypretty. But she was weak and emotional. The baby behaved admirably, evenwhen Lewis, trembling with pride, held it out to Mr. Glynn for baptismand held it so that the blood rushed to its head. "I baptize thee in thename of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." She was happy and thetears were in her eyes. The divine blessing was upon her and her house,and, after all, baby was a darling and her husband a kind, manly soul.With the help of heaven she would prove herself their good angel.When they returned home there was a whistle of old silver of light,graceful design, a present from Mrs. Taylor to Muriel. Her aunt, Mrs.Farley, compared this to its disparagement with one already purchased byLewis, on the gaudily embossed stem of which perched a squirrel with anut in its mouth. But Selma shook her head. "Both of you are wrong," shesaid with authority. "This is a beauty.""It doesn't look new to my eyes," protested Mrs. Parley."Of course it isn't new. I shouldn't wonder if she bought it whiletravelling abroad in Europe. It's artistic, and--and I shan't let babydestroy it."Babcock glanced from one gift to the other quizzically. Then by way ofdisposing of the subject he seized his daughter in his arms and dandlingher toward the ceiling cried, "If it's artistic things we must have,this is the most artistic thing which I know of in the wide world.Aren't you, little sugar-plum?"Mrs. Farley, with motherly distrust of man, apprehensively followed withher eyes and arms the gyrations of rise and fall; but Selma, though shesaw, pursued the current of her own thought which prompted her toexamine her wedding-ring. She was thinking that, compared with Mrs.Taylor's, it was a cart wheel--a clumsy, conspicuous band of metal,instead of a delicate hoop. She wondered if Lewis would object toexchange it for another.With the return of her strength, Selma took up again eagerly the tenorof her former life, aiding and abetting Mrs. Earle in the development ofthe Institute. The president was absorbed in enlarging its scope by theenrollment of more members, and the establishment of classes in avariety of topics--such as literature, science, philosophy, currentevents, history, art, and political economy. She aimed to construct aclub which should be social and educational in the broadest sense bymutual co-operation and energy. Selma, in her eagerness to make the mostof the opportunities for culture offered, committed herself to two ofthe new topic classes--"Italian and Grecian Art," and "The Governmentsof Civilization," and as a consequence found some difficulty inaccommodating her baby's nursing hours to these engagements. It wasindeed a relief to her when the doctor presently pronounced the supplyof her breast-milk inadequate. She was able to assuage Lewis' regretthat Muriel should be brought up by hand with the information that alarge percentage of Benham and American mothers were similarly barrenand that bottle babies were exceedingly healthy. She had gleaned thefirst fact from the physician, the second from Mrs. Earle, and her ownconclusion on the subject was that a lack of milk was an indication offeminine evolution from the status of the brute creation, a sign ofspiritual as opposed to animal quality. Selma found Mrs. Earlesympathetic on this point, and also practical in her suggestions as tothe rearing of infants by artificial means, recommendations concerningwhich were contained in one of her series of papers entitled "MotherLore."The theory of the new classes was co-operation. That is, the memberssuccessively, turn by turn, lectured on the topic, and all were expectedto study in the interim so as to be able to ask questions and discussthe views of the lecturer. Concerning both Italian and Grecian Art andthe Governments of Civilization, Selma knew that she had convictions inthe abstract, but when she found herself face to face with a specificlecture on each subject, it occurred to her as wise to supplement herideas by a little preparation. The nucleus of a public library had beenrecently established by Joel Flagg and placed at the disposal of Benham.Here, by means of an encyclopaedia and two hand-books, Selma was able inthree forenoons to compile a paper satisfactory to her self-esteem onthe dynasties of Europe and their inferiority to the United States, buther other task was illumined for her by a happy incident, the promise ofLittleton to lend her books. Indeed he seemed delightfully interested inboth of her classes, which was especially gratifying in view of the factthat Mrs. Taylor, who was a member of the Institute, had combated thenew programme on the plea that they were attempting too much and that itwould encourage superficiality. But Littleton seemed appreciative of thevalue of the undertaking, and he made his promise good forthwith byforwarding to her a package of books on art, among them two volumes ofRuskin. Selma, who had read quotations from Ruskin on one or twooccasions and believed herself an admirer of, and tolerably familiarwith, his writings, was thrilled. She promptly immersed herself in"Stones of Venice" and "Seven Lamps of Architecture," sitting up late atnight to finish them. When she had read these and the article in theencyclopaedia under the head of Art, she felt bursting with her subjectand eager to air her knowledge before the class. Her lecture wasacknowledged to be the most stirring and thorough of the course.Reports of its success came back to her from Littleton, who offered toassist his pupil further by practical demonstration of the eternalarchitectural fitness and unfitness of things--especially the latter--inwalks through the streets of Benham. But six times in as many months,however. There was no suggestion of coquetry on either side in theseexcursions, yet each enjoyed them. Littleton's own work was beginning toassume definite form, and his visits to Benham became of necessity morefrequent; flying trips, but he generally managed to obtain a few wordswith Selma. He continued to lend her books, and he invited her criticismon the slowly growing church edifice. The responsibility of critic wasan absorbing sensation to her, but the stark glibness of tongue whichstood her in good stead before the classes of the Institute failed herin his presence--the presence of real knowledge. She wished to praise,but to praise discriminatingly, with the cant of aesthetic appreciation,so that he should believe that she knew. As for the church itself, shewas interested in it; it was fine, of course, but that was a secondaryconsideration compared with her emotions. His predilection in her favor,however, readily made him deaf in regard to her utterances. He scarcelyheeded her halting, solemn, counterfeit transcendentalisms; or ratherthey passed muster as subtle and genuine, so spell bound was he by theDelphic beauty of her criticising expression. It was enough for him towatch her as she stood with her head on one side and the worriedarchangel look transfiguring her profile. What she said was lost in hisreverie as to what she was--what she represented in his contemplation.As she looked upon his handiwork he was able to view it with differenteyes, to discern its weaknesses and to gain fresh inspiration from herpresence. He felt that it was growing on his hands and that he should beproud of it, and though, perhaps, he was conscious in his inner soulthat she was more to him than another man's wife should be, he knew too,that no word or look of his had offended against the absent husband.CHAPTER VI.By the end of another six months Littleton's work was practicallycompleted. Only the finishing touches to the interior decorationremained to be done. The members of Rev. Mr. Glynn's congregation,including Mrs. Hallett Taylor, were thoroughly satisfied with theappearance of the new church. It was attractive in its lines, yet it wassimple and, consequently, in keeping with the resources of the treasury.There was no large bill for extras to be audited, as possibly would havebeen the case had a hard-headed designer like Mr. Pierce been employed.The committee felt itself entitled to the congratulations of thecommunity. Nor was the community on the whole disposed to grumble, forhome talent had been employed by the architect; under rigoroussupervision, to be sure, so that poor material and slap-dash workmanshipwere out of the question. Still, payments had been prompt, and Benhamwas able to admire competent virtue. The church was a monument ofsuggestion in various ways, artistic and ethical, and it shone neatlywith Babcock varnish.One morning Selma set forth by agreement with Littleton, in order toinspect some fresco work. Muriel Grace was ailing slightly, but as shewould be home by mid-day, she bade the hired girl be watchful of baby,and kept her appointment. The child had grown dear to her, for Murielwas a charming little dot, and Selma had already begun to enjoy thematernal delight of human doll dressing, an extravagance in which shewas lavishly encouraged by her husband. Babcock was glad of any excuseto spend money on his daughter, who seemed to him, from day to day, agreater marvel of precocity--such a child as became Selma's beauty andcleverness and his own practical common-sense.Selma was in a pensive frame of mind this morning. Two days before shehad read a paper at the Institute on "Motherhood," which had beenenthusiastically received. Mrs. Earle had printed a flattering itemconcerning it in the _Benham Sentinel_. It was agreeable to her to begoing to meet Littleton, for he was the most interesting masculinefigure in her life. She was sure of Lewis. He was her husband and sheknew herself to be the apple of his eye; but she knew exactly what hewas going to say before he said it, and much of what he said grated onher. She was almost equally sure of Littleton; that is of hisadmiration. His companionship was a constant pleasure to her. As amarried woman, and as a Christian and American woman, she desired nomore than this. But on the other hand, she would fain have this admiringcompanionship continue; and yet it could not. Littleton had told her theday before that he was going back to New York and that it was doubtfulif he would return. She would miss him. She would have the Institute andMrs. Earle still, but her life would be less full.Littleton was waiting for her at the church entrance. She followed himdown the nave to the chancel where she listened dreamily to hispresentation of the merits of the new decoration. He seemed inclined totalk, and from this presently branched off to describe with enthusiasmthe plates of a French book on interior architecture, which he hadrecently bought as a long-resisted but triumphant piece of extravagance.Mechanically, they turned from the chancel and slowly made the round ofthe aisles. A short silence succeeded his professional ardor. Hiscurrent of thought, in its reversion to home matters, had reminded himafresh of what was perpetually this morning uppermost in hisconsciousness--his coming departure."Now," he said, abruptly, "is the most favorable opportunity I shallhave, Mrs. Babcock, to tell you how much I am your debtor. I shan'tdespair of our meeting again, for the world is small, and good friendsare sure to meet sooner or later. But the past is secure to me at anyrate. If this church is in some measure what I have dreamed and wishedit to be, if my work with all its faults is a satisfaction to myself, Iwish you to know how much you have contributed to make it what it is."The words were as a melody in Selma's ears, and she listened greedily.Littleton paused, as one seriously moved will pause before giving thedetails of an important announcement. She, thinking he had finished,interjected with a touch of modesty, "I'm so glad. But my suggestionsand criticisms have not been what I meant them to be. It was all new tome, you know.""Oh, yes. It hasn't been so much what you have said in words which hashelped me, though that has been always intelligent and uplifting. I didnot look for technical knowledge. You do not possess that, of course.There are women in New York who would be able to confuse you with theirfamiliarity with these things. And yet it is by way of contrast withthose very women--fine women, too, in their way--that you have been mygood angel. There is no harm in saying that. I should be an ingrate,surely, if I would not let you know that your sane, simple outlook uponlife, your independent vision, has kept my brain clear and my soul free.I am a better artist and a better man for the experience. Good-by, andmay all happiness attend you. If once in a while you should find time towrite to a struggling architect named Littleton, he will be charmed todo your bidding--to send you books and to place his professionalknowledge at your service. Good-by."He held out his hand with frank effusion. He was obviously happy athaving given utterance to his sense of obligation. Selma was tinglingfrom head to foot and a womanly blush was on her cheek, though theserious seraph spoke in her words and eyes. She felt moved to a wave ofunreserved speech."What you have said is very interesting to me. I wish to tell you howmuch I, too, have enjoyed our friendship. The first time we met I feltsure we should be sympathetic, and we have been, haven't we? One of thefine things about friendships between men and women in this country isthat they can really get to know each other without--er--harm to either.Isn't it? It's such a pleasure to know people really, and I feel as if Ihad known you, as if we had known each other really. I've never knownany man exactly in that way, and I have always wanted to. Except, ofcourse, my husband. And he's extremely different--that is, his tastesare not like yours. It's a happiness to me to feel that I have been ofassistance to you in your work, and you have been equally helpful to mein mine. As you say, I have never had the opportunity to learn thetechnical parts of art, and your books have instructed me as to that. Ihave never been in New York, but I understand what you meant about yourfriends, those other women. I suppose society people must be constantlydiverted from serious work--from the intellectual and spiritual life. Ohyes, we ought to write. Our friendship mustn't languish. We must leteach other know what we are thinking and doing. Good-by."As Selma walked along the street her heart was in her mouth. She feltpity for herself. To just the right person she would have confessed thediscovery that she had made a mistake and tied herself for life to thewrong man. It was not so much that she fancied Littleton whichdistressed her, for, indeed, she was but mildly conscious ofinfatuation. What disturbed her was the contrast between him andBabcock, which definite separation now forced upon her attention. Anindefinable impression that Littleton might think less of her if shewere to state this soul truth had restrained her at the last moment fromdisclosing the secret. Not for an instant did she entertain the idea ofbeing false to Lewis. Her confession would have been but a dissertationon the inexorable irony of fate, calling only for sympathy, and in noway derogating from her dignity and self-respect as a wife. Still, shehad restrained herself, and stopped just short of the confidence. He wasgone, and she would probably not see him again for years. That wasendurable. Indeed, a recognition of the contrary would not have seemedto her consistent with wifely virtue. What brought the tears to her eyeswas the vision of continued wedlock, until death intervened, with ahusband who could not understand. Could she bear this? Must she endureit? There was but one answer: She must. At the thought she bit her lipwith the intensity and sternness of a martyr. She would be faithful toher marriage vows, but she would not let Lewis's low aims interfere withthe free development of her own life.It was after noon when she reached home. She was met at the door by thehired girl with the worried ejaculation that baby was choking. Thedoctor was hastily summoned. He at once pronounced that Muriel Grace hadmembranous croup, and was desperately ill. Remedies of various sortswere tried, and a consulting physician called, but when Babcock returnedfrom his office her condition was evidently hopeless. The child died inthe early night. Selma was relieved to hear the doctor tell her husbandthat it was a malignant case from the first, and that nothing could haveaverted the result. In response to questions from Lewis, however, shewas obliged to admit that she had not been at home when the acutesymptoms appeared. This afforded Babcock an outlet for his suffering. Hespoke to her roughly for the first time in his life, bitterly suggestingneglect on her part."You knew she wasn't all right this morning, yet you had to gofiddle-faddling with that architect instead of staying at home where youbelonged. And now she's dead. My little girl, my little girl!" And thebig man burst out sobbing.Selma grew deadly pale. No one had ever spoken to her like that beforein her life. To the horror of her grief was added the consciousness thatshe was being unjustly dealt with. Lewis had heard the doctor'sstatement, and yet he dared address her in such terms. As if the loss ofthe child did not fall equally on her."If it were to be done over again, I should do just the same," sheanswered, with righteous quietness. "To all appearances she had nothingbut a little cold. You have no right to lay the blame on me, hermother." At the last word she looked ready to cry, too.Babcock regarded her like a miserable tame bull. "I didn't mean to," heblubbered. "She's taken away from me, and I'm so wretched that I don'tknow what I'm saying. I'm sorry, Selma."He held out his arms to her. She was ready to go to them, for the angelof death had entered her home and pierced her heart, where it should bemost tender. She loved her baby. Yet, when she had time to think, shewas not sure that she wished to have another. When the bitterness of hisgrief had passed away, that was the hope which Lewis ventured toexpress, at first in a whisper, and later with reiterated boldness.Selma acquiesced externally, but she had her own opinions. Certainthings which were not included in "Mother Lore," had been confided byMrs. Margaret Rodney Earle by word of mouth in the fulness of theirmutual soul-scourings, and had remained pigeon-holed for futurereference in Selma's inner consciousness. Another baby just at this timemeant interference with everything elevating. There was time enough. Ina year or two, when she had established herself more securely in thesocial sphere of Benham, she would present her husband with a secondchild. It was best for them both to wait, for her success was hissuccess; but it would be useless to try to make that clear to him in hispresent mood.So she put away her baby things, dropping tears over the little socksand other reminders of her sorrow, and took up her life again, keepingher own counsel. The sympathy offered her was an interesting experience.Mrs. Earle came to her at once, and took her to her bosom; Mrs. Taylorsent her flowers with a kind note, which set Selma thinking whether sheought not to buy mourning note-paper; and within a week she received avisit of condolence from Mr. Glynn, rather a ghastly visit. Ghastly,because Lewis sat through it all with red eyes, very much as though hewere listening to a touching exhortation in church. To be sure, hegripped the pastor's hand like a vice, at the end, and thanked him forcoming, but his silent, afflicted presence had interfered with the freeinterchange of thought which would have been possible had she been alonewith the clergyman. The subject of death, and the whole train ofreflections incident to it, were uppermost in her mind, and she wouldhave been glad to probe the mysteries of the subject by controversialargument, instead of listening to hearty, sonorous platitudes. Shelistened rather contemptuously, for she recognized that Mr. Glynn wassaying the stereotyped thing in the stereotyped way, without realizingthat it was nothing but sacerdotal pap, little adapted to an intelligentsoul. What was suited to Lewis was not fit for her. And yet her baby'sdeath had served to dissipate somewhat the immediate discontent whichshe felt with her husband. His strong grief had touched her in spite ofherself, and, though she blamed him still for his inconsiderateaccusation, she was fond of him as she might have been fond of someloving Newfoundland, which, splendid in awkward bulk, caressed her andlicked her hand. It was pleasant enough to be in his arms, for the touchof man--even the wrong man--was, at times, a comfort.She took up again with determined interest her relations to theInstitute, joining additional classes and pursuing a variety of topicsof study, in regard to some of which she consulted Littleton. She missedhis presence less than she had expected, especially after they had begunto correspond and were able to keep in touch by letter. His letters weredelightful. They served her in her lecture courses, for they so clearlyand concisely expressed her views that she was able to use long extractsfrom them word for word. And every now and then they contained arespectful allusion which showed that he still retained a personalinterest in her. So the weeks slipped away and she was reasonably happy.She was absorbed and there was nothing new to mar the tenor of her life,though she was vaguely conscious that the loss of their little girl hadwidened the breach between her and her husband--widened it for thereason that now, for the first time, he perceived how lonely he was. Thebaby had furnished him with constant delight and preoccupation. He hadlooked forward all day to seeing it at night, and questions relating toit had supplied a never-ceasing small change of conversation between himand her. He had let her go her way with a smile on his face. Selma didnot choose to dwell on the situation, but it was obvious that Lewiscontinued to look glum, and that there were apt to be long silencesbetween them at meals. Now and again he would show some impatience atthe continuous recurrence of the Institute classes as a bar to someproject of domesticity or recreation, as though she had not been anactive member of the Institute before baby was born.One of the plans in which Mrs. Earle was most interested was a Congressof Women's Clubs, and in the early summer of the same year--some fourmonths subsequent to the death of Muriel Grace--a small beginning towardthis end was arranged to take place in Chicago. There were to be sixdelegates from each club, and Selma was unanimously selected as one ofthe delegation from the Benham Women's Institute. The opinion wasgenerally expressed that a change would do her good, and there was noquestion that she was admirably fitted to represent the club. Selma, whohad not travelled a hundred miles beyond Benham in her life, was elatedat the prospect of the expedition; so much so that she proudly recountedto Lewis the same evening the news of her appointment. It never occurredto her that he would wish to accompany her, and when he presentlyinformed her that he had been wishing to go to Chicago on business forsome time, and that the date proposed would suit him admirably, she wasdumfounded. Half of the interest of the expedition would consist intravelling as an independent delegation. A husband would be in the wayand spoil the savor of the occasion. It would never do, and so Selmaproceeded to explain. She wished to go alone."A pack of six women travel by themselves?" blurted Lewis. "Supposethere were an accident?" he added, after searching his brain for a lessfeeble argument."We should either be killed or we shouldn't be," said Selma firmly. "Weare perfectly well able to take care of ourselves. Women travel aloneeverywhere every-day--that is, intelligent American women."Lewis looked a little sad. "I thought, perhaps, it would seem nice foryou to go with me, Selma. We haven't been off since we were married, andI can get away now just as well as not.""So it would have been if I weren't one of the delegation. I shouldthink you would see, Lewis, that your coming is out of the question."So it proved. Selma set forth for Chicago on the appointed day, mademany new acquaintances among the delegates, and was pleased to beintroduced and referred to publicly as Mrs. Selma Babcock--a form ofaddress to which she was unaccustomed at Benham. On the night before herdeparture, being in pleasant spirits, she told Lewis that her absencewould do him good, and that he would appreciate her all the more on herreturn.She was to be gone a week. The first twenty-four hours passed gloomilyfor Babcock. Then he began to take notice. He noticed that the countyfair was fixed for the following days. He had hoped to carry Selmathere, but, as she was not to be had, it seemed to him sensible to getwhat enjoyment from it he could alone. Then it happened that a formercompanion of his bachelor days and his bachelor habits, a commercialtraveller, whom he had not seen since his marriage, appeared on thescene."The very man for me!" he ejaculated, jubilantly.The obscurity of this remark was presently made clear to his friend, whohad hoped perhaps to enjoy a snug evening at Babcock's domestic hearth,but who was not averse to playing a different part--that of cheering upa father who had lost his baby, and whose wife had left him in thelurch. He assured Babcock that a regular old time outing--a shakingup--would do him good, and Babcock was ready to agree with him,intending thereby a free-handed two days at the fair. As has beenintimated, his manner of life before marriage had not beenirreproachable, but he had been glad of an opportunity to put an end tothe mildly riotous and coarse bouts which disfigured his otherwisecommonplace existence. He had no intention now of misbehaving himself,but he felt the need of being enlivened. His companion was a man whodelighted in what he called a lark, and whose only method of insuring alark was by starting in with whiskey and keeping it up. That had beenalso Babcock's former conception of a good time, and though he had dimlyin mind that he was now a husband and church-member, he strove toconduct himself in such a manner as to maintain his self-respect withoutbecoming a spoil sport.During the first day at the fair Babcock managed to preserve this nicedistinction. On the second, he lost account of his conduct, and by thelate afternoon was sauntering with his friend among the booths in thecompany of two suspicions looking women. With these same women the pairof revellers drove off in top buggies just before dusk, and vanished inthe direction of the open country.CHAPTER VII.Babcock returned to his home twenty-four hours later like a whipped cur.He was disgusted with himself. It seemed to him incredible that heshould have fallen so low. He had sinned against his wife and his ownself-respect without excuse; for it was no excuse that he had lethimself be led to drink too much. His heart ached and his cheek burnedat the recollection of his two days of debauchery. What was to be done?If only he were able to cut this ugly sore in his soul out with a knifeand have done with it forever! But that was impossible. It stared him inthe face, a haunting reality. In his distress he asked himself whetherhe would not go to Mr. Glynn and make a clean breast of it; but hispractical instincts answered him that he would none the less have made abeast of himself. He held his head between his hands, and stareddejectedly at his desk. Some relief came to him at last only from thereflection that it was a single fault, and that it need never--it shouldnever be repeated. Selma need not know, and he would henceforth avoidall such temptations. Terrible as it was, it was a slip, not adeliberate fault, and his love for his wife was not in question.Thus reasoning, he managed by the third day after his return to reach aless despondent frame of mind. While busy writing in his office a ladywas announced, and looking up he encountered the meretricious smile ofthe courtesan with whom he had forgotten himself. She had taken a fancyto her victim, and having learned that he was well to do, she had comein order to establish, if possible, on a more permanent basis, herrelations with him. She was a young woman, who had been drifting fromplace to place, and whose professional inclination for a protector washeightened by the liking which she had conceived for him. Babcockrecalled in her smile merely his shame, and regarded her reappearance aseffrontery. He was blind to her prettiness and her sentimental mood. Heasked her roughly what she wanted, and rising from his chair, he badeher be gone before she had time to answer. Nine out of ten women of herclass would have taken their dismissal lightly. Some might have answeredback in tones loud enough to enlighten the clerks, and thus haveaccomplished a pretty revenge in the course of retreat. This particularLesbian was in no humor to be harshly treated. She was a littledesperate and Babcock had pleased her. It piqued her to be treated insuch a fashion; accordingly, she held her ground and sat down. She triedupon him, alternately, irony and pathos. He was angry but confused underthe first, he became savage and merciless under the second, throwingback in her teeth the suggestion of her fondness, and stigmatizing hercoarsely. Then she became angry in her turn--angry as a woman whoseproffered love is spurned. The method for revenge was obvious, and shetold him plainly what she intended. His wife should know at once how herhusband passed his time during her absence. She had posted herself, andshe saw that her shaft hurt. Babcock winced, but mad and incredulous, hethreatened her with arrest and drove her from the room. She went outsmiling, but with an ominous look in her eyes, the remembrance of whichmade him ask himself now and again if she could be vicious enough, orfool enough, to keep her promise. He dismissed the idea as improbable;still the bare chance worried him. Selma was to arrive early the nextmorning, and he had reconciled himself to the conclusion that she neednever know, and that he would henceforth be a faithful husband. Had henot given an earnest of his good faith in his reception of his visitor?Surely, no such untoward and unnatural accident would dash the cup ofreturning happiness from his lips. A more clever man would have gonestraight to police headquarters, instead of trusting to chance.A night's rest reassured him as to the idleness of the threat, so thathe was able to welcome Selma at the railroad station with acomparatively light heart. She was in high spirits over the success ofher expedition, and yet graciously ready to admit that she was glad toreturn home--meaning thereby, to her own bed and bathing facilities; butthe general term seemed to poor Lewis a declaration of wifely devotion.He went to his business with the mien of a man who had passed through anordeal and is beginning life again; but when he returned at night, assoon as he beheld Selma, he suspected what had happened.She was awaiting him in the parlor. Though he saw at a glance that shelooked grave, he went forward to kiss her, but she rose and, steppingbehind the table, put out her hand forbiddingly."What is the matter?" he faltered."That woman has been here," was her slow, scornful response."Selma, I--" A confusing sense of hopelessness as to what to say chokedBabcock's attempt to articulate. There was a brief silence, while helooked at her imploringly and miserably."Is it true what she says? Have you been false to your marriage vows?Have you committed adultery?""My God! Selma, you don't understand.""It is an easy question to answer, yes or no?""I forgot myself, Selma. I was drunk and crazy. I ask your pardon."She shook her head coldly. "I shall have nothing more to do with you. Icannot live with you any longer.""Not live with me?""Would you live with me if it were I who had forgotten myself?""I think I would, Selma. You don't understand. I was a brute. I havebeen wretched ever since. But it was a slip--an accident. I drank toomuch, and it happened. I love you, Selma, with all my heart. I havenever been false to you in my affection.""It is a strange time to talk of affection. I went away for a week, andin my absence you insulted me by debauchery with a creature like that.Love? You have no conception of the meaning of the word. Oh no, I shallnever live with you again."Babcock clinched his palms in his distress and walked up and down. Shestood pale and determined looking into space. Presently he turned to herand asked with quiet but intense solicitude, "You don't mean that you'regoing to leave me for one fault, we being husband and wife and thelittle girl in her grave? I said you don't understand and you don't. Aman's a man, and there are times when he's been drinking when he'sliable to yield to temptation, and that though he's so fond of his wifethat life without her would be misery. This sounds strange to a woman,and it's a poor excuse. But it ought to count, Selma, when it comes to aquestion of our separating. There would be happy years before us yet ifyou give me another chance.""Not happy years for me," she replied concisely. "The American womandoes not choose to live with the sort of man you describe. She demandsfrom her husband what he demands from her, faithfulness to the marriagetie. We could never be happy again. Our ideal of life is different. Ihave made excuses for you in other things, but my soul revolts at this."Babcock looked at her for a moment in silence, then he said, a littlesternly, "You shouldn't have gone away and left me. I'm not blaming you,but you shouldn't have gone." He walked to the window but he sawnothing. His heart was racked. He had been eager to humiliate himselfbefore her to prove his deep contrition, but he had come to the end ofhis resources, and yet she was adamant. Her charge that she had beenmaking excuses for him hitherto reminded him that they had not beenreally sympathetic for some time past. With his back turned to her heheard her answer:"It was understood before I agreed to marry you that I was to be free tofollow my tastes and interests. It is a paltry excuse that, because Ileft you alone for a week in pursuit of them, I am accessory to yoursin."Babcock faced her sadly. "The sin's all mine," he said. "I can't denythat. But, Selma, I guess I've been pretty lonely ever since the babydied.""Lonely?" she echoed. "Then my leaving you will not matter so much.Here," she said, slipping off her wedding-ring, "this belongs to you."She remembered Mrs. Earle's proceeding, and though she had not yetdecided what course to pursue in order to maintain her liberty, sheregarded this as the significant and definite act. She held out thering, but Babcock shook his head."The law doesn't work as quick as that, nor the church either. You canget a divorce if you're set on it, Selma. But we're husband and wifeyet.""Only the husk of our marriage is left. The spirit is dead," she saidsententiously. "I am going away. I cannot pass another night in thishouse. If you will not take this ring, I shall leave it here."Babcock turned to hide the tears which blinded his eyes. Selma regardedhim a moment gravely, then she laid her wedding-ring on the table andwent from the room.She put her immediate belongings into a bag and left the house. She haddecided to go to Mrs. Earle's lodgings where she would be certain tofind shelter and sympathy. Were she to go to her aunt's she would beexposed to importunity on her husband's behalf from Mrs. Farley, who waspartial to Lewis. Her mind was entirely made up that there could be noquestion of reconciliation. Her duty was plain; and she would be doingherself an injustice were she to continue to live with one so weak andregardless of the honor which she had a right to demand of the man towhom she had given her society and her body. His gross conduct hadentitled her to her liberty, and to neglect to seize it would be tocondemn herself to continuous unhappiness, for this overt act of his wasmerely a definite proof of the lack of sympathy between them, of whichshe had for some time been well aware at heart. As she walked along thestreet she was conscious that it was a relief to her to be sloughing offthe garment of an uncongenial relationship and to be starting lifeafresh. There was nothing in her immediate surroundings from which shewas not glad to escape. Their house was full of blemishes from thestand-point of her later knowledge, and she yearned to dissociateherself, once and for all, from the trammels of her pitiful mistake. Shebarely entertained the thought that she was without means. She wouldhave to support herself, of course, but it never occurred to her todoubt her ability to do so, and the necessity added a zest to herdecision. It would be plain sailing, for Mrs. Earle had more than onceinvited her to send copy to the _Benham Sentinel_, and there was no formof occupation which would be more to her liking than newspaper work. Itwas almost with the mien of a prisoner escaped from jail that she walkedin upon her friend and said:"I have left my husband. He has been unfaithful to me."In Mrs. Earle, conventional feminine instincts were apt, before she hadtime to think, to get the upper hand of her set theories. "You, poor,poor child," she cried extending her arms.Selma had not intended to weep. Still the opportunity was convenient,and her nerves were on edge. She found herself sobbing with her head onMrs. Earle's, bosom, and telling her sad story."He was never good enough for you. I have always said so," Mrs. Earlemurmured stroking her hair."I ought to have known from the first that it was impossible for us tobe happy. Why did I ever marry him? He said he loved me, and I letmyself be badgered into it," Selma answered through her tears. "Well,it's all over now," she added, sitting up and drying her eyes. "He hasgiven me back my liberty. I am a free woman.""Yes, dear, if you are perfectly sure of yourself, there is only onecourse to pursue. Only you should consider the matter solemnly. Perhapsin a few days, after he has apologized and shown proper contrition, youmight feel willing to give him another chance."Selma was unprepared for Mrs. Earle's sentimentality. "Surely," sheexclaimed with tragic earnestness, "you wouldn't have me live with himafter what occurred? Contrition? He said everything he could think of toget me to stay, but I made my decision then and there."Mrs. Earle put her own handkerchief to her eyes. "Women have forgivensuch things; but I respect you all the more for not being weak. I knowhow you feel. It is hard to do, but if I had it to do over again, Iwould act just the same--just the same. It's a serious responsibility toencourage any one to desert a home, but under the circumstances I wouldnot live with him another minute, my child--not another minute."Thereupon Mrs. Earle protruded her bosom to celebrate the triumph ofjustice in her own mental processes over conventional and maudlinscruples. "You will apply for a divorce, I suppose?""I have not considered that. All I care for is never to see him again.""Oh yes, you must get a divorce. It is much better, you know. In my caseI couldn't, for he did nothing public. A divorce settles matters, andputs you back where you were before. You might wish some day to marryagain.""I have had enough of marriage.""It isn't any harm to be a free woman--free in the eye of the law aswell as of conscience. I know an excellent lawyer--a Mr. Lyons, asympathetic and able man. Besides your husband is bound to support you.You must get alimony.""I wouldn't touch a dollar of his money," Selma answered with scorn. "Iintend to support myself. I shall write--work.""Of course you will, dear; and it will be a boon and a blessing to me tohave you in our ranks--one of the new army of self-supporting,self-respecting women. I suppose you are right. I have never had asixpence. But your husband deserves to be punished. Perhaps it ispunishment enough to lose you.""He will get over that. It is enough for me," she exclaimed, ardently,after a dreamy pause, "that I am separated from him forever--that I amfree--free--free."A night's sleep served to intensify Selma's determination, and she awokeclearly of the opinion that a divorce was desirable. Why remain fetteredby a bare legal tie to one who was a husband only in name? Accordingly,in company with Mrs. Earle, she visited the office of James O. Lyons,and took the initiatory steps to dissolve the marriage.Mr. Lyons was a large, full-bodied man of thirty-five, with a fat,cleanly-shaven, cherubic countenance, an aspect of candor, and keen,solemn eyes. His manner was impressive and slightly pontificial; hisvoice resonant and engaging. He knew when to joke and when to be graveas an owl. He wore in every-day life a shiny, black frock-coat, astanding collar, which yawned at the throat, and a narrow, black tie.His general effect was that of a cross between a parson and a shrewdYankee--a happy suggestion of righteous, plain, serious-mindedness,protected against the wiles of human society--and able to protectothers--by a canny intelligence. For a young man he had already aconsiderable clientage. A certain class of people, notably thehard-headed, God-fearing, felt themselves safe in his hands. Hismagnetic yet grave manner of conducting business pleased Benham,attracting also both the distressed and the bilious portions of thecommunity, and the farmers from the surrounding country. As Mrs. Earleinformed Selma, he was in sympathy with all progressive and stimulatingideas, and he already figured in the newspapers politically, and beforethe courts as a friend of the masses, and a fluent advocate of socialreforms. His method of handling Selma's case was smooth. To begin with,he was sympathetic within proper limits, giving her tacitly tounderstand that, though as a man and brother, he deplored the necessityof extreme measures, he recognized that she had made up her mind, andthat compromise was out of the question. To put it concisely, his mannerwas grieved, but practical. He told her that he would represent toBabcock the futility of contesting a cause, which, on the evidence, mustbe hopeless, and that, in all probability, the matter could be disposedof easily and without publicity. He seemed to Selma a very sensible andcapable man, and it was agreeable to her to feel that he appreciatedthat, though divorce in the abstract was deplorable, her experiencejustified and called for the protection of the law.In the meantime Babcock was very unhappy, and was casting about for amethod to induce his wife to return. He wrote to her a pitiful letter,setting forth once more the sorry facts in the best light which he couldbring to bear on them, and implored her forgiveness. He applied to heraunt, Mrs. Farley, and got her to supplement his plea with hergood-natured intervention. "There are lots of men like that," sheconfided to Selma, "and he's a kind, devoted creature." When thisfailed, he sought Rev. Mr. Glynn as a last resort, and, after he hadlistened to a stern and fervid rating from the clergyman on the lust ofthe flesh, he found his pastor on his side. Mr. Glynn was opposed todivorce on general ecclesiastical principles; moreover, he had beeneducated under the law of England, by which a woman cannot obtain adivorce from her husband for the cause of adultery unless it be coupledwith cruelty--a clever distinction between the sexes, which wasdoubtless intended as a cloak for occasional lapses on the part of man.It was plain to him, as a Christian and as a hearty soul, that there hadbeen an untoward accident--a bestial fault, a soul-debasing carnal sin,but still an accident, and hence to be forgiven by God and woman. It washis duty to interfere; and so, having disciplined the husband, heessayed the more delicate matter of propitiating the wife. And heessayed it without a thought of failure."I'm afraid she's determined to leave me, and that there's not muchhope," said Babcock, despondently, as he gripped the clergyman's hand intoken of his gratitude."Nonsense, my man," asserted Mr. Glynn briskly. "All she needs is anexhortation from me, and she will take you back."Selma was opposed to divorce in theory. That is, she had accepted ontrust the traditional prejudice against it as she had acceptedShakespeare and Boston. But theory stood for nothing in her regardbefore the crying needs of her own experience. She had not the leastintention of living with her husband again. No one could oblige her todo that. In addition, the law offered her a formal escape from hiscontrol and name. Why not avail herself of it? She recollected, besides,that her husband's church recognized infidelity as a lawful ground ofrelease from the so-called sacrament of marriage. This had come into hermind as an additional sanction to her own decision. But it had notcontributed to that decision. Consequently, when she was confronted inMrs. Earle's lodgings by the errand of Mr. Glynn, she felt that hiscoming was superfluous. Still, she was glad of the opportunity tomeasure ideas with him in a thorough interview free from interruption.Mr. Glynn's confidence was based on his intention to appeal to the everwomanly quality of pity. He expected to encounter some resistance, forindisputably here was a woman whose sensibilities had been justly andseverely shocked--a woman of finer tissue than her husband, as he hadnoted in other American couples. She was entitled to her day incourt--to a stubborn, righteous respite of indignation. But he expectedto carry the day in the end, amid a rush of tears, with which his ownmight be mingled. He trusted to what he regarded as the innatereluctance of the wife to abandon the man she loved, and to the leavenof feminine Christian charity.As a conscientious hater of sin, he did not attempt to minimizeBabcock's act or the insult put upon her. That done, he was free tointercede fervently for him and to extol the virtue and the advisabilityof forgiveness. This plea, however cogent, was narrow, and once statedadmitted merely of duplication in the same form. It was indeed noargument, merely an appeal, and, in proportion as it failed to move thelistener, became feeble. Selma listened to him with a tense face, herhands clasped before her in the guise of an interested andself-scrutinizing spirit. But she betrayed no sign of yielding, orsymptom of doubt. She shook her head once or twice as he proceeded, and,when he paused, asked why she should return to a man who had brokenfaith with her; asked it in such a genuine tone of conviction that Dr.Glynn realized the weakness of his own case, and became slightly nettledat the same time."True," he said, rather sternly, "your husband has committed a hideous,carnal sin, but he is genuinely repentant. Do you wish to ruin his lifeforever?""His life?" said Selma. "It would ruin my life to return to him. I haveother plans--plans which will bring me happiness. I could never be happywith him."The clergyman was baffled. Other plans! The words offended him, and yethe could not dispute her right to do as she chose. Still he saw fit tomurmur: "He that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth hislife for my sake shall find it."Selma flushed. To be accused of acting contrary to Christian preceptswas painful and surprising to her. "Mr. Glynn," she said, "I see youdon't understand. My husband and I ought never to have married. It hasall been a dreadful mistake. We have not the same tastes and interests.I am sorry for him, but I can never consent to return to him. To do sowould condemn us both to a life of unhappiness. We were not intended forhusband and wife, and it is best--yes, more Christian--for us toseparate. We American women do not feel justified in letting a mistakeruin our lives when there is a chance to escape."Mr. Glynn regarded her in silence for a moment. He was accustomed toconvince, and he had not succeeded, which to a clergyman is moreannoying than to most men. Still what she said made his plea seemdoubtful wisdom."Then you do not love your husband?" he said."No," said Selma quietly, "I do not love him. It is best to be frankwith one's self--with you, in such a matter, isn't it? So you see thatwhat you ask is out of the question."Mr. Glynn rose. Clearly his mission had failed, and there was nothingmore to be said. Being a just man, he hesitated to pass an unkindjudgment on this bright-faced, pensive woman. She was within her moralrights, and he must be careful to keep within his. But he went awaybewildered and discomfited. Selma would have liked to dismiss thesubject and keep him longer. She would have been glad to branch off onto other ethical topics and discuss them. She was satisfied with theresult of the interview, for she had vindicated her position and spikedLewis's last gun.So, indeed, it proved. Mr. Glynn sent for Babcock and told him the nakedtruth, that his wife's love for him was dead and reconciliationimpossible. He properly refrained from expressing the doubt lurking inhis own mind as to whether Selma had ever loved her husband. Thusconvinced of the hopelessness of his predicament, Babcock agreed to Mr.Lyons's suggestion not to contest the legal proceedings. The lawyer hadbeen diligent, and the necessary evidence--the testimony of thewoman--was secure. She was ready to carry her revenge to the end,hoping, perhaps, that the victim of it would return to her when he hadlost his wife. Accordingly, a few weeks later, Selma was granted adivorce nisi and the right to resume her maiden name. She had decided,however, to retain the badge of marriage as a decorous social prefix,and to call herself Mrs. Selma White.CHAPTER VIII.The consciousness that she was dependent for the means of support solelyon her own exertions was a genuine pleasure to Selma, and she appliedherself with confidence and enthusiasm to the problem of earning herlivelihood. She had remained steadfast to her decision to accept nothingfrom her husband except the legal costs of the proceedings, though Mr.Lyons explained to her that alimony was a natural and moral increment ofdivorce. Still, after her refusal, he informed her as a man and a friendthat he respected and admired the independence of her action, which wasan agreeable tribute. She had fixed definitely on newspaper work as themost inviting and congenial form of occupation. She believed herself tobe well fitted for it. It would afford her an immediate income, and itwould give her the opportunity which she craved for giving publicexpression to her ideas and fixing attention on herself. There was roomfor more than one Mrs. Earle in Benham, for Benham was growing andwide-awake and on the alert for originality of any kind--especially inthe way of reportorial and journalistic cleverness. Selma had nointention of becoming a second Mrs. Earle. That is, she promised herselfto follow, but not to follow blindly; to imitate judiciously, but toimprove on a gradually diverging line of progress. This was meregeneralization as yet. It was an agreeable seething brain consciousnessfor future development. For the moment, however, she counted on Mrs.Earle to obtain for her a start by personal influence at the office ofthe _Benham Sentinel_. This was provided forthwith in the form of aninvitation to prepare a weekly column under the caption of "What WomenWear;" a summary of passing usages in clothes. The woman reporter incharge of it had just died. Selma's first impulse was to decline thework as unworthy of her abilities, yet she was in immediate need ofemployment to avoid running in debt and she was assured by Mrs. Earlethat she would be very foolish to reject such an offer. Reflectioncaused her to think more highly of the work itself. It would afford hera chance to explain to the women of Benham, and indirectly to thecountry at large, that taste in dress was not necessarily inconsistentwith virtue and serious intentions--a truth of which she herself hadbecome possessed since her marriage and which it seemed to her might beutilized delightfully in her department. She would endeavor to treatdress from the standpoint of ethical responsibility to society, and toshow that both extravagance and dowdy homeliness were to be avoided.Clothes in themselves had grown to be a satisfaction to her, and anyassociation of vanity would be eliminated by the introduction of aserious artistic purpose into a weekly commentary concerning them.Accordingly she accepted the position and entered upon its duties withgrave zeal.For each of these contributions Selma was to receive eight dollars--fourhundred a year, which she hoped to expand to a thousand by creativeliterary production--preferably essays and poetry. She hired a room inthe same neighborhood as Mrs. Earle, in the boarding-house districtappurtenant to Central Avenue--that is to say, on the ragged edge ofBenham's social artery, and set up her new household gods. The interestof preparing the first paper absorbed her to the exclusion of everythingelse. She visited all the dress-making and dry-goods establishments intown, examined, at a hint from Mrs. Earle, the fashion departments ofthe New York papers, and then, pen in hand, gave herself up to hersubject. The result seemed to her a happy blending of timely philosophyand suggestions as to toilette, and she took it in person to the editor.He saw fit to read it on the spot. His brow wrinkled at first and helooked dubious. He re-read it and said with some gusto, "It's a novelty,but I guess they'll like it. Our women readers have been used to fashionnotes which are crisp and to the point, and the big houses expect tohave attention called to the goods they wish to sell. If you'll run overthis again and set your cold facts in little paragraphs by themselvesevery now and then, I shouldn't wonder if the rest were a sort oflecture course which will catch them. It's a good idea. Next time youcould work in a pathetic story--some references to a deadbaby--verses--anecdotes--a little variety. You perceive the idea?""Oh, yes," said Selma, appropriately sober at the allusion yet ecstatic."That's just what I should like to do. It would give me more scope. Iwish my articles to be of real use--to help people to live better, andto dress better.""That's right, that's right; and if they make the paper sell, we'll knowthat folks like them," responded the editor with Delphic urbanity.The first article was a success. That is, Selma's method was notinterfered with, and she had the satisfaction of reading in the_Sentinel_ during the week an item calling gratified attention to thechange in its "What Women Wear" column, and indicating that it wouldcontain new features from week to week. It gave her a pleasant thrill tosee her name, "Selma White," signed at the end of the printed column,and she set to work eagerly to carry out the editor's suggestions. Atthe same time she tried her hand at a short story--the story of anAmerican girl who went to Paris to study art, refused to alter her modeof life to suit foreign ideas of female propriety, displayed exceptionaltalent as an artist, and finally married a fine-spirited young American,to the utter discomfiture of a French member of the nobility, who hadbegun by insulting her and ended with making her an offer of marriage.This she sent to the _Eagle_, the other Benham newspaper, for its Sundayedition.It took her a month to compose this story, and after a week she receivedit back with a memorandum to the effect that it was one-half too long,but intimating that in a revised form it would be acceptable. This was alittle depressing, especially as it arrived at a time when the noveltyof her occupation had worn off and she was realizing the limitations ofher present life. She had begun to miss the advantages of a free purseand the importance of a domestic establishment. She possessed herliberty, and was fulfilling her mission as a social force, but her lifehad been deprived of some of its savor, and, though she was thankful tobe rid of Babcock, she felt the lack of an element of personal devotionto herself, an element which was not to be supplied by mere admirationon the part of Mrs. Earle and the other members of the Institute. It didnot suit her not to be able to gratify her growing taste in clothes andin other lines of expenditure, and there were moments when sheexperienced the need of being petted and made much of by a man. She wasconscious of loneliness, and in this mood she pitied herself as a victimof untoward circumstances, one who had wasted the freshness of her younglife, and missed the happiness which the American wife is apt to findwaiting for her. Under the spell of this nostalgia she wrote a poementitled "The Bitter Sweets of Solitude," and disposed of it for fivedollars to the _Sentinel_. The price shocked her, for the verses seemedflesh of her flesh. Still, five dollars was better than nothing, and shediscerned from the manner of the newspaper editor that he cared littlewhether she left them or not. It was on that evening that she received aletter from Littleton, stating that he was on the eve of leaving NewYork for Benham. He was coming to consult concerning certain furtherinterior decorations which the committee had decided to add to thechurch.Selma's nerves vibrated blissfully as she read the news. For somereason, which she had never seen fit definitely to define, she hadchosen not to acquaint Littleton with the fact of her divorce. Theirletters had been infrequent during the last six months, for this visithad been impending, having been put off from time to time because thecommittee had been dilatory and he otherwise engaged. Perhaps her secretmotive had been to surprise him, to let him find himself confronted withan accomplished fact, which would obviate argument and reveal herestablished in her new career, a happy, independent citizen, withoutties. At any rate she smiled now at the address on the envelope--Mrs.Lewis Babcock. Obviously he was still in the dark as to the truth, andit would be her privilege to enlighten him. She began to wonder whatwould be the upshot of his coming, and tears came to her eyes, tears ofself-congratulation that the narrow tenor of her daily life was to beirradiated by a sympathetic spirit.When Littleton duly appeared at the committee meeting on the followingday, Selma saw at a glance that he was unaware of what had happened. Helooked slightly puzzled when one of the members addressed her as Mrs.White, but evidently he regarded this as a slip of the tongue. Selmalooked, as she felt, contented and vivacious. She had dressed herselfsimply, but with effective trigness. To those who knew her experience,her appearance indicated courage and becoming self-respect. Publicopinion, even as embodied in the church committee, while deploring thenecessity, was not disposed to question the propriety of her action.That is, all except Mrs. Taylor. In her, Selma thought she had detectedsigns of coldness, a sort of suspicious reservation of judgment, whichcontrasted itself unpleasantly with the sympathetic attitude of theothers, who were fain to refer to her, in not altogether muffledwhispers, as a plucky, independent, little woman. Hence, she was gladthat Mrs. Taylor happened to be detained at home by illness on thisafternoon, and that, accordingly, she was free to enjoy unreservedly thedramatic nature of the situation. Her heart beat a little faster as thechairman, turning to her to ask a question, addressed her unmistakablyas Mrs. White. She could not refrain from casting half-amused,half-pathetic sheep's eyes at Littleton. He started visibly, regardedher for, a moment in obvious amazement, then flushed to the roots of hishair. She felt the blood rising to her own cheeks, and a sensation ofmild triumph. The meeting was over and the members were merely lingeringto tie up the loose threads of the matter arranged for. In a few momentsSelma found herself with the architect sufficiently apart from theothers for him to ask:"Two persons have addressed you this afternoon as Mrs. White. I do notunderstand."She cast down her eyes, as a woman will when a question of modesty isinvolved, then she raised them and said: "You did not know, then, that Ihad left my husband?""Left him?""Yes. I have obtained a divorce. He was unfaithful to me.""I see"--said Littleton with a sort of gasp--"I see. I did not know. Younever wrote to me.""I did not feel like writing to any body. There was nothing to be donebut that."Littleton regarded her with a perturbed, restless air."Then you live no longer at 25 Onslow Avenue?""Oh, no. I left there more than six months ago. I live in lodgings. I amsupporting myself by literary work. I am Mrs. Selma White now, and mydivorce has been absolute more than a month."She spoke gravely and quietly, with less than her usual assurance, forshe felt the spell of his keen, eager scrutiny and was not averse toyield at the moment to the propensity of her sex. She wondered what hewas thinking about. Did he blame her? Did he sympathize with her?"Where are you going when you leave here?" he asked."Home--to my new home. Will you walk along with me?""That is what I should like. I am astonished by what you have told me,and am anxious to hear more about it, if to speak of it would not woundyou. Divorced! How you must have suffered! And I did not have the chanceto offer you my help--my sympathy.""Yes, I have suffered. But that is all over now. I am a free woman. I ambeginning my life over again."It was a beautiful afternoon, and by mutual consent, which neither putinto words, they diverged from the exact route to Selma's lodging houseand turned their steps to the open country beyond the city limits--thepicturesque dell which has since become the site of Benham's publicpark. There they seated themselves where they would not be interrupted.Selma told him on the way the few vital facts in her painful story, towhich he listened in a tense silence, broken chiefly by an occasionalejaculation expressive of his contempt for the man who had brought suchunhappiness upon her. She let him understand, too, that her marriedlife, from the first, had been far less happy than he hadimagined--wretched makeshift for the true relation of husband and wife.She spoke of her future buoyantly, yet with a touch of sadness, asthough to indicate that she was aware that the triumphs of intelligenceand individuality could not entirely be a substitute for a happy home."And what do you expect to do?" he inquired in a bewildered fashion, asthough her delineation of her hopes had been lost on him."Do? Support myself by my own exertions, as I have told you. By writingI expect. I am doing very well already. Do you question my ability tocontinue?""Oh, no; not that. Only--""Only what? Surely you are not one of the men who grudge women thechance to prove what is in them--who would treat us like china dolls andcircumscribe us by conventions? I know you are not, because I have heardyou inveigh against that very sort of narrow mindedness. Only what?""I can't make up my mind to it. And I suppose the reason is that itmeans so much to me--that you mean so much to me. What is the use of mydodging the truth, Selma--seeking to conceal it because such a shorttime has elapsed since you ceased to be a wife? Forgive me if I hurtyou, if it seem indelicate to speak of love at the very moment when youare happy in your liberty. I can't help it; it's my nature to speakopenly. And there's no bar now. The fact that you are free makes clearto me what I have not dared to countenance before, that you are the onewoman in the world for me--the woman I have dreamed of--and longed tomeet--the woman whose influence has blessed me already, and without whomI shall lack the greatest happiness which life can give. Selma, I loveyou--I adore you."Selma listened with greedy ears, which she could scarcely believe. Itseemed to her that she was in dream-land, so unexpected, yet entrancing,was his avowal. She had been vaguely aware that he admired her more thanhe had allowed himself to disclose, and conscious, too, that hispresence was agreeable to her; but in an instant now she recognized thatthis was love--the love she had sought, the love she had yearned toinspire and to feel. Compared with it, Babcock's clumsy ecstasy and herown sufferance of it had been a sham and a delusion. Of so much she wasconscious in a twinkling, and yet what she deemed proper self-respectrestrained her from casting herself into his arms. It was, indeed, soon,and she had been happy in her liberty. At least, she had supposedherself so; and she owed it to her own plans and hopes not to acthastily, though she knew what she intended to do. She had been lonely,yes starving, for lack of true companionship, and here was the soulwhich would be a true mate to hers.They were sitting on a grassy bank. He was bending toward her withclasped hands, a picture of fervor. She could see him out of the cornerof her glance, though she looked into space with her gaze of seraphicworry. Yet her lips were ready to lend themselves to a smile of blissfulsatisfaction and her eyes to fill with the melting mood of the thoughtthat at last happiness had come to her.The silence was very brief, but Littleton, as would have seemed fittingto her, feared lest she were shocked."I distress you," he said. "Forgive me. Listen--will you listen?" Selmawas glad to listen. The words of love, such love as this, weredelicious, and she felt she owed it to herself not to be won too easily."I am listening," she answered softly with the voice of one face to facewith an array of doubts."Before I met you, Selma, woman but was a name to me. My life brought melittle into contact with them, except my dear sister, and I had notemptation to regret that I could not support a wife. Yet I dreamed ofwoman and of love and of a joy which might some day come to me if Icould meet one who fulfilled my ideal of what a true woman should be. SoI dreamed until I met you. The first time I saw you, Selma, I knew in myheart that you were a woman whom I could love. Perhaps I should haverecognized more clearly as time went on that you were more to me eventhen than I had a right to allow; yet I call heaven to witness that Idid not, by word or sign, do a wrong to him who has done such a cruelwrong to you.""Never by word or sign," echoed Selma solemnly. The bare suggestion thatBabcock had cause to complain of either of them seemed to herpreposterous. Yet she was saying to herself that it was easy to perceivethat he had loved her from the first."And since I love you with all my soul must I--should I in justice tomyself--to my own hopes of happiness, refrain from speaking merelybecause you have so recently been divorced? I must speak--I am speaking.It is too soon, I dare say, for you to be willing to think of marriageagain--but I offer you the love and protection of a husband. My meansare small, but I am able now to support a wife in decent comfort. Selma,give me some hope. Tell me, that in time you may be willing to trustyourself to my love. You wish to work--to distinguish yourself. Would Ibe a hindrance to that? Indeed, you must know that I would do everything in my power to promote your desire to be of service to the world."The time for her smile and her tears had come. He had argued his caseand her own, and it was clear to her mind that delay would be futile.Since happiness was at hand, why not grasp it? As for her work, he neednot interfere with that. And, after all, now that she had tried it, wasshe so sure that newspaper work--hack work, such as she was pursuing,was what she wished? As a wife, re-established in the security of ahome, she could pick and choose her method of expression. Perhaps,indeed, it would not be writing, except occasionally. Was not New York awide, fruitful field, for a reforming social influence? She saw herselfin her mind's eye a leader of movements and of progress. And that with aman she loved--yes, adored even as he adored her.So she turned to Littleton with her smile and in tears--the image ofbewitching but pathetic self-justification and surrender. Her mind wasmade up; hence why procrastinate and coyly postpone the desirable, andthe inevitable? That was what she had the shrewdness to formulate in theecstasy of her transport; and so eloquent was the mute revelation of herlove that Littleton, diffident reverencer of the modesty of woman as hewas, without a word from her clasped her to his breast, a victor in abreath. As, regardless of the possible invasion of interlopers, he tookher in his embrace, she felt with satisfaction once more the grasp ofmasculine arms. She let her head fall on his shoulder in delightedcontentment. While he murmured in succession inarticulate terms ofendearment, she revelled in the thrill of her nerves and approved herown sagacious and commendable behavior."Dearest," she whispered, "you are right. We are right. Since we loveeach other, why should we not say so? I love you--I love you. The uglyhateful past shall not keep us apart longer. You say you loved me fromthe first; so did I love you, though I did not know it then. We weremeant for each other--God meant us--did he not? It is right, and weshall be so happy, Wilbur.""Yes, Selma." Words seemed to him an inadequate means for expressing hisemotions. He pressed his lips upon hers with the adoring respect of aworshipper touching his god, yet with the energy of a man. She sighedand compared him in her thought with Babcock. How gentle this new lover!How refined and sensitive and appreciative! How intelligent andgentlemanly!"If I had my wish, darling," he said, "we should be married to-night andI would carry you away from here forever."She remembered that Babcock had uttered the same wish on the occasionwhen he had offered himself. To grant it then had been out of thequestion. To do so now would be convenient--a prompt and satisfactoryblotting out of her past and present life--a happy method of solvingmany minor problems of ways and means connected with waiting to bemarried. Besides it would be romantic, and a delicious, fitting crowningof her present blissful mood.He mistook her silence for womanly scruples, and he recounted with alittle laugh the predicament in which he should find himself on his ownaccount were they to be so precipitate. "What would my sister think ifshe were to get a telegram--'Married to-night. Expect us to-morrow?' Shewould think I had lost my senses. So I have, darling; and you are thecause. She knows about you. I have talked to her about you.""But she thinks I am Mrs. Babcock.""Oh yes. Ha! ha! It would never do to state to whom I was married,unless I sent a telegram as long as my arm. Dear Pauline! She will beradiant. It is all arranged that she is to stay where she is in the oldquarters, and I am to take you to a new house. We've decided on that,time and again, when we've chanced to talk of what might happen--of 'thefair, the chaste and unexpressive she'--my she. Dearest, I wondered if Ishould ever find her. Pauline has always said that she would never runthe risk of spoiling everything by living with us.""It would be very nice--and very simple," responded Selma, slowly. "Youwouldn't think any the worse of me, Wilbur, if I were to marry youto-night?""The worse of you? It is what I would like of all things. Whom does itconcern but us? Why should we wait in order to make a public spectacleof ourselves?""I shouldn't wish that. I should insist on being married very quietly.Under all the circumstances there is really no reason--it seems to me itwould be easier if we were to be married as soon as possible. It wouldavoid explanations and talk, wouldn't it? That is, if you are perfectlysure.""Sure? That I love you? Oh Selma!"She shut her eyes under the thrill which his kiss gave her. "Then wewill be married whenever you wish," she said.It was already late in the afternoon, so that the prospects of obtaininga license did not seem favorable. Still it happened that Littleton knewa clergyman of his own faith--Unitarian--in Benham, a college classmate,whom he suggested as soon as he understood that Selma preferred not tobe married by Mr. Glynn. They found him at home, and by diligentpersonal effort on his part the necessary legal forms were complied withand they were made husband and wife three hours before the departure ofthe evening train for New York. After the ceremony they steppedbuoyantly, arm in arm in the dusk, along the street to send the telegramto Miss Littleton, and to snatch a hasty meal before Selma went to herlodgings to pack. There were others in the restaurant, so havingdiscovered that they were not hungry, they bought sandwiches andbananas, and resumed their travels. The suddenness and surprise of itall made Selma feel as if on wings. It seemed to her to be of theessence of new and exquisite romance to be walking at the side of herfond, clever lover in the democratic simplicity of two paper bags ofprovender and an open, yet almost headlong marriage. She felt that atlast she was yoked to a spirit who comprehended her and who wouldstimulate instead of repress the fire of originality within her. She hadfound love and she was happy. Meanwhile she had decided to leave Benhamwithout a word to anyone, even Mrs. Earle. She would write and explainwhat had happened.BOOK II.THE STRUGGLECHAPTER I.Littleton had not expected that Selma would accede to his request to bemarried at once, but he was delighted at her decision. He had utteredhis wish in sincerity, for there was really no reason for waiting, andby an immediate marriage they would escape the tedium of an engagementduring which they could hope to see each other but rarely. He was ableto support a wife provided they were to live simply and economically. Hefelt sure that Selma understood his circumstances and was no less readythan he to forego luxuries in order that they might be all in all toeach other spiritually as husband and wife. Besides he had hopes thathis clientage would continue to grow so that he would be able to provideall reasonable comforts for his new home. Consequently he drove up fromthe station in New York with a light heart, fondly pointing out to hiswife this and that building and other objects of interest. He mistookher pensive silence for diffidence at the idea of descending suddenly onanother woman's home--a matter which in this instance gave him noconcern, for he had unlimited confidence in Pauline's executive abilityand her tendency not to get ruffled. She had been his good angel,domestically speaking, and, indeed, in every way, since they had firstbegun to keep house together, and it had rather amused him to let fallsuch a bombshell as the contents of his telegram upon the regularity ofher daily life."Don't be nervous, darling," he said gayly. "You will find Paulinebubbling over with joy at our coming, and everything arranged as thoughwe were expected to live there all our lives."Selma looked at him blankly and then remembered. She was not feelingnervous, and Pauline was not in her thoughts. She had been lost in herown reflections--lost in the happy consciousness of the contrast betweenher new and her old husband, and in the increasing satisfaction that shewas actually in New York. How bright and busy the streets looked! Thethrong of eager passers and jostling vehicles against the background ofbrilliant shop-windows bewildered and stimulated her. She was saying toherself that here was the place where she was suited to live, and mutelyacknowledging its superiority to Benham as a centre of life. This was arash, swift conclusion, but Selma prided herself on her capacity toarrive at wise judgments by rapid mental processes. So absorbed was shein the glittering, stirring panorama that Wilbur's efforts atenlightenment were practically wasted. She was in no humor for details;she was glorying in the exalted impression which the whole vivid sceneproduced upon her.His remark caused her to realize that they must be near theirdestination. She had no misgivings on the score of her own reception,but she was interested and curious to see Pauline, this wonderful sisterof whom Wilbur was so fond and so proud. Then her husband cried, "Herewe are!" and in another moment she found herself in the hearty embraceof a large, comely woman who met her at the door. This of course must bePauline. Selma was just a little shocked by the fervor of the greeting;for though she delighted in rapid intimacies, unexpected liberties withher person were contrary to her conceptions of propriety. Still it wasdelightful to be welcomed so heartily. She returned the embrace warmlybut with dignity, and allowed herself to be convoyed into the house armin arm with her new relation who seemed, indeed, to be bubbling overwith joy. It was not until they were in the same room that Selma couldget a good look at her.Pauline Littleton was fine looking rather than pretty. She was tall andsubstantial, with an agreeable face, an intelligent brow, a firm yetsweet mouth, and steady, honest eyes which now sparkled with pleasure.Her physique was very different from her brother's. Selma noticed thatshe was taller than herself and only a little shorter than Wilbur. Shehad Wilbur's smile too, suggesting a disposition to take thingshumorously; but her expression lacked the poetic cast which made him soattractive and congenial to herself and excused the existence of thelighter vein. Selma did not admire women who were inclined to be stout.She associated spareness of person with high thinking, and an abundanceof flesh as an indication of material or commonplace aims. She reflectedthat Pauline was presumably business-like and a good house-keeper, and,very likely, an industrious teacher in her classes, but she set her downin her mind as deficient in the finer sensibilities of the spiritbelonging to herself and Wilbur. It was instinctive with Selma to form aprompt estimate of every one she met, and it was a relief to her to cometo the agreeable conclusion that there was nothing in hersister-in-law's appearance to make her discontented with herself. Thiswarmed her heart at once toward Pauline. To be sure Pauline manifestedthe same sort of social grace which distinguished Mrs. Hallett Taylor,but Selma, though she still regarded this with suspicion, for the reasonthat she had not yet become mistress of it, was secretly content to knowthat she had married into a family which possessed it. Altogether shewas agreeably impressed by her scrutiny of her new sister, who, in heropinion, would not be an irritating rival either in looks or character,and yet who was a pleasing and sufficiently serious-minded person--inshort just the sort of sister-in-law which she yearned to have.Pauline, on her part, was duly fascinated by the delicate and inspiringbeauty of her brother's wife. She understood at once why Wilbur hadchosen her in preference to any one of his own circle. Selma obviouslysymbolized by her grave, tense, thin face the serious ideals of livingand womanhood, which had been dear to his meditation as a youth and apart of his heritage from his New England ancestors. It made her joyousto feel that he had found a wife who would be a constant source ofinspiration to him, for she knew that Wilbur would not be happy with anyone who fell short of his ideal as to what a woman should be. She knewher brother well, and she understood how deeply in earnest he was tomake the most of his life, and what an exalted vision he entertained asto the possibilities for mutual sympathy and help between husband andwife.Partly as a consequence of their limited means, partly owing toabsorption in their respective studies and interests, the Littletons,though of gentle stock, lived simple lives according to New Yorkstandards. They were aware of the growth of luxury resulting from theaccumulation of big fortunes since the war. As an architect, Wilbur sawlarger and more elaborate public and private buildings being erected onevery side. As a house-keeper and a woman with social interests, Paulineknew that the power of money was revolutionizing the public taste in thematter of household expenditure; that in the details of domestic lifethere was more color and more circumstance, and that people who werewell-to-do, and many who were not, were requiring as daily comforts allsorts of things to which they had been unaccustomed. But though theyboth thus knew vaguely that the temper of society had changed, and thatsober citizens and their wives, who, twenty years before, would haveprated solemnly against a host of gay, enlivening or pretty customs asincompatible with American virtue, were now adopting these as rapidly asmoney could procure them--the brother and sister had remainedcomparatively unaffected by the consequences of the transformationscene. Certainly their home had. It was old-fashioned in its garnitureand its gentility. It spoke of a day, not so many years before, whenhigh thinking had led to blinking where domestic decoration wasconcerned, and people had bought ugly wooden and worsted things to livewith because only the things of the spirit seemed of real importance.Still time, with its marvellous touch, has often the gift of makingfurniture and upholstery, which were hideous when bought, lookinteresting and cosey when they have become old-fashioned. In this wayPauline Wilbur's parlor was a delightful relic of a day gone by. Therewas scarcely a pretty thing in it, as Wilbur himself well knew, yet, asa whole, it had an atmosphere--an atmosphere of simple unaffectedrefinement. Their domestic belongings had come to them from theirparents, and they had never had the means to replenish them. When, indue time, they had realized their artistic worthlessness, they had heldto them through affection, humorously conscious of the incongruity thattwo such modern individuals as themselves should be living in a domesticmuseum. Then, presto! friends had begun to congratulate them on theuniqueness of their establishment, and to express affection for it. Ithad become a favorite resort for many modern spirits--artists, literarymen, musicians, self-supporting women--and Pauline's oyster suppers,cooked in her grandmother's blazer, were still a stimulus to highthinking.So matters stood when Selma entered it as a bride. Her coming signifiedthe breaking up of the household and the establishment. Pauline hadthought that out in her clear brain over night since receiving Wilbur'stelegram. Wilbur must move into a modern house, and she into a modernflat. She would keep the very old things, such as the blazer and someandirons and a pair of candlesticks, for they were ancient enough to bereally artistic, but the furniture of the immediate past, her father andmother's generation, should be sold at auction. Wilbur and she must, ifonly for Selma's sake, become modern in material matters as well as intheir mental interests.Pauline proceeded to unfold this at the dinner-table that evening. Shehad heard in the meanwhile from her brother, the story of Selma'sdivorce and the explanation of his sudden marriage; and in consequence,she felt the more solicitous that her sister-in-law's new venture shouldbegin propitiously. It was agreed that Wilbur should make inquiries atonce about houses further uptown, and that his present lease from yearto year should not be renewed. She said to Selma:"You have saved us from becoming an old-fashioned bachelor and maid. Ourfriends began to leave this neighborhood five years ago, and there is noone left. We are surrounded by boarding-houses and shops. We werecomfortable, and we were too busy to care. But it would never do for ayoung married couple to begin house-keeping here. You must have a brandnew house uptown, Selma. You must insist on that. Don't be alarmed,Wilbur. I know it will have to be small, but I noticed the other dayseveral blocks of new houses going up on the side streets west of thePark, which looked attractive and cheap.""I will look at them," said Wilbur. "Since you seem determined not tolive with us, and we are obliged to move, we will follow the procession.But Selma and I could be happy anywhere." He turned from his sister toher as he spoke with a proud, happy look.Selma said nothing to mar his confidence. She had no intention of livingeither with Pauline or in their present house, and she felt that hersister-in-law had shown good sense in recognizing that neither waspossible. She necessarily had vague ideas as to New York houses andlocations, but she had seen enough in her drive from the station tounderstand that it was a wonderful and decorative place. Although herexperience of Benham had taught her that some old things--such as Mrs.Hallett Taylor's gleanings from Europe--were desirable, she associatednew things with progress--especially American progress. Consequently theLittleton household possessions had puzzled her, for though she thoughtthem ugly, she was resolved not to commit herself too hastily. But nowthat Pauline had sounded a note of warning, the situation was clear.They had suffered themselves to fall behind the times, and she was to beher husband's good angel by helping him to catch up with them. And itwas evident that Pauline would be her ally. Selma for the first timeasked herself whether it might be that Wilbur was a little visionary.Meanwhile he was saying: "Pauline is right, Selma. I had already askedmyself if it would not be fairer to you to move uptown where we shouldbe in the van and in touch with what is going on. Pauline is gentlyhinting to you that you must not humor me as she has done, and let meeat bread and milk out of a bowl in this old curiosity shop, instead offollowing in the wake of fashion. She has spoiled me and now she desertsme at the critical moment of my life. Selma, you shall have the mostcharming modern house in New York within my means. It must be love in acottage, but the cottage shall have the latest improvements--hot andcold water, tiles, hygienic plumbing and dados.""Bravo!" said Pauline. "He says I have spoiled him, Selma. Perhaps Ihave. It will be your turn now. You will fail to convert him as I havefailed, and the world will be the better for it. There are too few menwho think noble thoughts and practice them, who are true to themselvesand the light which is in them through thick and thin. But you see, headmits himself that he needs to mix with the world a little more.Otherwise he is perfect. You know that perhaps, already, Selma. But Iwish to tell it to you before him. Take care of him, dear, won't you?""It was because I felt that his thoughts were nobler than most men'sthat I wished to marry him," Selma replied, seraphically. "But I can seethat it is sensible to live where your friends live. I shall try not tospoil him, Pauline." She was already conscious of a mission whichappealed to her. She had been content until now in the ardor of her loveto regard Wilbur as flawless--as in some respects superior to herself;but it was a gratification to her to detect this failing, and toperceive her opportunity for usefulness. Surely it was important for herhusband to be progressive and not merely a dreamer.Littleton looked from one to the other fondly. "Not many men are blessedwith the love of two such women," he said. "I put myself in your hands.I bow my neck to the yoke."In New York in the early seventies the fashionable quarter lay betweenEighth and Fortieth Streets, bounded on either side by Fourth and SixthAvenues. Central Park was completed, but the region west of it was, fromthe social stand-point, still a wilderness, and Fifth Avenue in theneighborhood of Twenty-third Street was the centre of elegant sociallife. Selma took her first view of this brilliant street on thefollowing day on her way to hunt for houses in the outlying district.The roar and bustle of the city, which thrilled yet dazed her, seemedhere softened by the rows of tall, imposing residences in brown stone.Along the sunny sidewalks passed with jaunty tread an ever-hurryingprocession of stylishly clad men and women; and along the roadbed spedan array of private carriages conducted by coachmen in livery. It was abrilliant day, and New Yorkers were making the most of it.Selma had never seen such a sight before. Benham faded intoinsignificance in comparison. She was excited, and she gazed eagerly atthe spectacle. Yet her look, though absorbed, was stern. This sort ofthing was unlike anything American within her personal experience. Thisavenue of grand houses and this procession of fine individuals and finevehicles made her think of that small section of Benham into which shehad never been invited, and the thought affected her disagreeably."Who are the people who live in these houses?" she asked, presently.Littleton had already told her that it was the most fashionable streetin the city."Oh, the rich and prosperous.""Those who gamble in stocks, I suppose." Selma wished to be assured thatthis was so."Some of them," said Littleton, with a laugh. "They belong to people whohave made money in various ways or have inherited it--our well-to-doclass, among them the first families in New York, and many of them ourbest citizens.""Are they friends of yours?"Littleton laughed again. "A few--not many. Society here is divided intosets, and they are not in my set. I prefer mine, and fortunately, for Ican't afford to belong to theirs.""Oh!"The frigidity and dryness of the exclamation Littleton ascribed toSelma's intuitive enmity to the vanities of life."You mustn't pass judgment on them too hastily," he said. "New York is awonderful place, and it's likely to shock you before you learn toappreciate what is interesting and fine here. I will tell you a secret,Selma. Every one likes to make money. Even clergymen feel it their dutyto accept a call from the congregation which offers the best salary, andprobing men of science do not hesitate to reap the harvest from awonderful invention. Yet it is the fashion with most of the people inthis country who possess little to prate about the wickedness ofmoney-getters and to think evil of the rich. That proceeds chiefly fromenvy, and it is sheer cant. The people of the United States are engagedin an eager struggle to advance themselves--to gain individualdistinction, comfort, success, and in New York to a greater extent thanin any other place can the capable man or woman sell his or her wares tothe best advantage--be they what they may, stocks, merchandise, law,medicine, pictures. The world pays well for the things it wants--and theworld is pretty just in the long run. If it doesn't like my designs,that will be because they're not worth buying. The great thing--thedifficult thing to guard against in the whirl of this great city, wherewe are all striving to get ahead--is not to sell one's self for money,not to sacrifice the thing worth doing for mere pecuniary advantage.It's the great temptation to some to do so, for only money can buy finehouses, and carriages and jewels--yes, and in a certain sense, socialpreferment. The problem is presented in a different form to every man.Some can grow rich honestly, and some have to remain poor in order to betrue to themselves. We may have to remain poor, Selma mia." He spokegayly, as though that prospect did not disturb him in the least."And we shall be just as good as the people who own these houses." Shesaid it gravely, as if it were a declaration of principles, and at thesame moment her gaze was caught and disturbed by a pair of blithe,fashionably dressed young women gliding by her with the quiet,unconscious grace of good-breeding. She was inwardly aware, though shewould never acknowledge it by word or sign, that such people troubledher. More even than Mrs. Taylor had troubled her. They were differentfrom her and they tantalized her.At the same moment her husband was saying in reply, "Just as good, butnot necessarily any better. No--other things being equal--not so good.We mustn't deceive ourselves with that piece of cant. Some of them arefrivolous enough, and dishonest enough, heaven knows, but so there arefrivolous and dishonest people in every class. But there are many morewho endeavor to be good citizens--are good citizens, our best citizens.The possession of money gives them the opportunity to become arbiters ofmorals and taste, and to seek culture under the best advantages. Afterall, an accumulation of money represents brains and energy in some one.Look at this swell," he continued, indicating an attractive lookingyoung man who was passing. "His grandfather was one of the ablest men inthe city--an intelligent, self-respecting, shrewd, industrious,public-spirited citizen who made a large fortune. The son has hadadvantages which I have never had, and I happen to know that he is afine fellow and a very able one. If it came to comparisons, I should beobliged to admit that he's a more ornamental member of society thanJones, Brown, or Robinson, and certainly no less useful. Do I shockyou--you sweet, unswerving little democrat of the democrats?"It always pleased Selma to be called endearing names, and it suited herin her present frame of mind to be dubbed a democrat, for it did notsuit her to be painfully realizing that she was unable, at one brilliantswoop, to take her place as a leader in social influence. Somehow shehad expected to do this, despite her first difficulties at Benham, forshe had thought of New York as a place where, as the wife of Littleton,the architect, she would at once be a figure of importance. She shookher head and said, "It's hard to believe that these people are really inearnest; that they are serious in purpose and spirit." Meanwhile she wasbeing haunted by the irritating reflection that her clothes and herbearing were inferior to those of the women she was passing. Secretlyshe was making a resolve to imitate them, though she believed that shedespised them. She put her hand through her husband's arm and added,almost fiercely, as she pressed closer to him, "We needn't trouble ourheads about them, Wilbur. We can get along without being rich andfashionable, you and I. In spite of what you say, I don't consider thissort of thing American.""Get along? Darling, I was merely trying to be just to them; to let yousee that they are not so black as they're painted. We will forget themforever. We have nothing in common with them. Get along? I feel that mylife will be a paradise living with you and trying to make someimpression on the life of this big, striving city. But as to its notbeing American to live like these people--well you know they areAmericans and that New York is the Mecca of the hard-fisted sons of toilfrom all over the country who have made money. But you're right, Selma.Those who go in for show and extravagance are not the bestAmericans--the Americans whom you and I believe in. Sometimes I getdiscouraged when I stop to think, and now I shall have you to keep mesteadfast to our faith.""Yes, Wilbur. And how far from here are we to live?""Oh, a mile or more. On some side street where the land is cheap and therent low. What do we care for that, Selma mia?"CHAPTER II.Shortly before Selma Littleton took up her abode in New York, MissFlorence, or, as she was familiarly known, Miss Flossy Price, was aninhabitant of a New Jersey city. Her father was a second cousin ofMorton Price, whose family at that time was socially conspicuous infashionable New York society. Not aggressively conspicuous, as ultrafashionable people are to-day, by dint of frequent newspaperadvertisement, but in consequence of elegant, conservativerespectability, fortified by and cushioned on a huge income. In theearly seventies to know the Morton Prices was a social passport, and byno means every one socially ambitious knew them. Morton Price'sgreat-grandfather had been a peddler, his grandfather a tea merchant,his father a tea merchant and bank organizer, and he himself did nothingmercantile, but was a director in diverse institutions, representingtrusts or philantrophy, and was regarded by many, including himself, asthe embodiment of ornamental and admirable citizenship. He could talk bythe hour on the degeneracy of state and city politics and the evil deedsof Congress, and was, generally speaking, a conservative, fastidious,well-dressed, well-fed man, who had a winning way with women and a happyfaculty of looking wise and saying nothing rash in the presence of men.Some of the younger generation were apt, with the lack of reverencebelonging to youth, to speak of him covertly as "a stuffed club," but noecho of this epithet had ever reached the ear of his cousin, DavidPrice, in New Jersey. For him, as for most of the world within a radiusof two hundred miles, he was above criticism and a monument of socialpower.David Price, Miss Flossy's father, was the president of a small andunprogressive but eminently solid bank. Respectable routine was hismotto, and he lived up to it, and, as a consequence, no more soundinstitution of the kind existed in his neighborhood. He and hisdirectors were slow to adopt innovations of any kind; they put stumblingblocks in the path of business convenience whenever they could; inshort, David Price in his humble way was a righteous, narrow, hide-boundretarder of progress and worshipper of established local custom.Therefore it was a constant source of surprise and worry to him that heshould have a progressive daughter. There were four other children,patterns of quiet, plodding conservatism, but--such is the irony offate--the youngest, prettiest, and his favorite, was an independent,opinionated young woman, who seemed to turn a deaf ear to paternal andmaternal advice of safest New Jersey type. In her father's words, shehad no reverence for any thing or any body, which was approximatelytrue, for she did not hesitate to speak disrespectfully even of the headof the house in New York."Poppa," she said one day, "Cousin Morton doesn't care for any of us alittle bit. I know what you're going to say," she added; "that he sendsyou two turkeys every Thanksgiving. The last were terribly tough. I'msure he thinks that we never see turkeys here in New Jersey, and that heconsiders us poor relations and that we live in a hole. If one of usshould call on him, I know it would distress him awfully. He's right inthinking that this is a hole. Nothing ever happens here, and when Imarry I intend to live in New York."This was when she was seventeen. Her father was greatly shocked,especially as he suspected in his secret soul that the tirade was truein substance. He had been the recipient of Thanksgiving turkeys fornearly twenty years on the plea that they had been grown on the donor'sfarm in Westchester county, and he had seen fit to invite hisfellow-directors annually to dine off one of them as a modest noticethat he was on friendly terms with his aristocratic New York cousin. Butin all these twenty years turkeys had been the only medium ofintercourse between them. David Price, on the few occasions when he hadvisited New York, had not found it convenient to call. Once he hadwalked by on the other side of Fifth avenue and looked at the house, butshyness and the thought that he had no evening clothes in his valise hadrestrained him from ringing the doorbell."You do your cousin Morton great injustice--great injustice, Florence,"he answered. "He never forgets to send the turkeys, and as to the restof your speech, I have only to say that it is very disrespectful andvery foolish. The next time I go to New York I will take you to call onyour cousins.""And what would I say to them? No thank you, poppa." The young womanshook her head decisively, and then she added, "I'm not going to call onthem, until I'm fit to. There!"The ambiguity of this remark gave Mr. Price the opportunity to say that,in view of her immediate shortcomings, it was a wise conclusion, but heknew what she really meant and was distressed. His feeling toward hiscousin, though mildly envious, did not extend to self-depreciation, norhad it served to undermine his faith in the innate dignity and worth ofNew Jersey family life. He could not only with a straight face, but witha kindling eye inveigh against the perils of New York fashionable life,and express gratification that no son or daughter of his had wandered sofar from the fold. It distressed him to think that Florence should becasting sheep's eyes at the flesh-pots of Gotham, and so failing toappreciate the blessings and safety of a quiet American home.Miss Flossy continued to entertain and to express opinions of her own,and as a result became socially interesting. At eighteen, by her beauty,her engaging frankness and lack of self-consciousness, she spread havocamong the young men of her native city, several of whom offered hermarriage. But marriage was far from her thoughts. Life seemed toointeresting and she wished to see the world. She was erect and alertlooking, with a compact figure of medium height, large brown eyes andrich red hair, and a laughing mouth; also an innocent demeanor, whichserved to give her, by moonlight, the effect of an angel. She succeededin visiting Bar Harbor, where she promptly became a bright particularstar among the galaxy of young women who at that period wereestablishing the reputation of the summer girl. She continued to be asummer girl for four seasons without injury to her own peace of mind. Atthe end of the fourth summer she appeared on close scrutiny to be alittle worn, and her innocent air seemed a trifle deliberate. Shereturned to her home in New Jersey in not quite her usual spirits. Infact she became pensive. She had seen the world, and lo! she found itstuffed with sawdust. She was ready to settle down, but the only manwith whom she would have been willing to settle had never asked her. Hewas the brother of one of the girls who had been forbidden by her motherto stay out in canoes with young men after nine at night. The rumor hadreached Flossy that this same mother had referred to her in "the fishpond" at Rodick's as "that dreadful girl." It would have pleased herafter that to have wrung an offer of marriage from the son and heir, whoknew her cousins, the Morton Prices, and to whom she would have beenwilling to engage herself temporarily at all events. He was verydevoted; they stayed out in his canoe until past midnight; he wroteverses to her and told her his innermost thoughts; but he stopped there.He went away without committing himself, and she was left to chew thecud of reflection. It was bitter, not because she was in love with him,for she was not. In her heart she knew he bored her a little. But shewas piqued. Evidently he had been afraid to marry "that dreadful girl."She was piqued and she was sad. She recognized that it was another caseof not being fit. When would she be fit? What was she to do in order tobecome fit--fit like the girl who was not allowed to stay on the waterafter nine o'clock? She had ceased to think of the young man, but theimage of his sister haunted her. How stylish she was, yet how simple andquiet! "I wonder," thought Flossy to herself, "if I could ever becomelike her." The reflection threw her into a brown study in which sheremained for weeks, and during which she refused the hand of a staid andrespectable townsman, who, in her father's words, was ready to take herwith all her follies. David Price was disappointed. He loved thisindependent daughter, and he had hopes that her demure and reticentdeportment signified that the effervescence of youth had evaporated. Butit was only an effort on Flossy's part to imitate the young man'ssister.At this juncture and just when she was bored and dispirited by theprocess, Gregory Williams appeared on the scene. Flossy met him at adancing party. He had a very tall collar, a very friendly, confident,and (toward her) devoted manner, and good looks. It was whispered amongthe girls that he was a banker from New York. He was obviously not overthirty, which was young for a banker, but so he presently describedhimself to Flossy with hints of impending prosperity. He spoke gliblyand picturesquely. He had a convincing eloquence of gesture--a wave ofthe hand which suggested energy and compelled confidence. He had pickedher out at once to be introduced to, and sympathy between them wasspeedily established. Her wearing, as a red-headed girl, a white horsein the form of a pin, in order to prevent the attention of the men towhom she talked from wandering, delighted him. He said to himself thathere was a girl after his own heart. He had admired her looks at theoutset, but he gazed at her now more critically. He danced every dancewith her, and they sat together at supper, apart from everybody else.Flossy's resolutions were swept away. That is, she had become in aninstant indifferent to the fact that the New York girl she had yearnedto imitate would not have made herself so conspicuous. Her excuse wasthat she could not help herself. It was a case of genuine, violentattraction, which she made no effort to straggle against.The attraction was violent on both sides. Gregory Williams was notseeking to be married. He had been, until within six months, a broker'sclerk, and had become a banker on the strength of ten thousand dollarsbequeathed to him by a grandmother. He and a clerk from another broker'soffice, J. Willett VanHorne, had recently formed a partnership asWilliams & VanHorne, Bankers and Dealers in Stocks and Bonds. He was notseeking to be married, but he intended to be married some day, and itwas no part of his scheme of life to deny himself anything he wished.Support a wife? Of course he could; and support her in the samegrandiose fashion which he had adopted for himself since he had begunbusiness on his own account. He had chosen as a philosophy of life thesmart paradox, which he enjoyed uttering, that he spent what he neededfirst and supplied the means later; and at the same time he let it beunderstood that the system worked wonderfully. He possessed unlimitedconfidence in himself, and though he was dimly aware that a very smallturn of the wheel of fortune in the wrong direction would ruin himfinancially, he chose to close his eyes to the possibilities of disasterand to assume a bold and important bearing before the world. He hadimplicit faith in his own special line of ability, and he appreciatedthe worth of his partner, VanHorne. He had joined forces with VanHornebecause he knew that he was the opposite of himself--that he was adelving, thorough, shrewd, keen office man--and able too. How genuinelyable Williams did not yet know. He himself was to be the showy partner,the originator of schemes and procurer of business, the brilliant manbefore the world. So there was some method in his madness. And with itall went a cheery, incisive, humorous point of view which was congenialand diverting to Flossy.He went away, but he came back once--twice--thrice in quick succession.On business, so he said casually to Mr. and Mrs. Price, but his languageto their daughter was a declaration of personal devotion. It remainedfor her to say whether she would marry him or no. Of one thing she wassure without need of reflection, that she loved him ardently. As aconsequence she surrendered at once, though, curiously enough, she wasconscious when she permitted him to kiss her with effusion that he wasnot the sort of man she had intended to marry--that he was not fit inher sense of the word. Yet she was determined to marry him, and from themoment their troth was plighted she found herself his eager and faithfulally, dreaming and scheming on their joint account. She would help himto succeed; they would conquer the world together; she would never doubthis ability to conquer it. And in time--yes, in time they would makeeven the Morton Prices notice them.And so after some bewildered opposition on the part of Mr. Price, whowas alternately appalled and fascinated by the magniloquent language ofhis would-be son-in-law, they were married. Flossy gave but a singlesign to her husband that she understood him and recognized what theyreally represented. It was one evening a few months after they had setup housekeeping while they were walking home from the theatre. They hadpreviously dined at Delmonico's, and the cost of the evening'sentertainment, including a bottle of champagne at dinner, their ticketsand a corsage bouquet of violets for Flossy, had been fifteen dollars.Flossy wore a resplendent theatre hat and fashionable cape--one of theseveral stylish costumes with which her husband had hastened to presenther, and Gregory was convoying her along the Avenue with the air of aman not averse to have the world recognize that they were a well set upand prosperous couple. Flossy had put her arm well inside his and wasdoing her best to help him produce the effect which he desired, when shesuddenly said:"I wonder, Gregory, how long it will be before we're really anybody.Now, of course, we're only make believe swell."Gregory gave an amused laugh. "What a clever little woman! That's justwhat we are. We'll keep it a secret, though, and won't advertise it tothe world.""Mum's the word," she replied, giving his arm a squeeze. "I only wishedyou to know that I was not being fooled; that I understood."Fate ordained that the Williamses and the Littletons should take housesside by side in the same block. It was a new block, and at first theywere the sole occupants. Williams bought his house, giving a mortgageback to the seller for all the man would accept, and obtaining a secondmortgage from a money lender in consideration of a higher rate ofinterest, for practically the remaining value. He furnished his houseornately from top to bottom in the latest fashion, incurring bills for aportion of the effects, and arranging to pay on the instalment planwhere he could not obtain full credit. His reasoning was convincing tohimself and did not alarm Flossy, who was glad to feel that they werethe owners of the house and attractive furniture. It was that the landwas sure to improve in value before the mortgage became due, and as forthe carpets and curtains and other outlays, a few points in the stockmarket would pay for them at any time.Wilbur Littleton did not possess the ready money to buy; consequently hetook a lease of his new house for three years, and paid promptly for thefurniture he bought, the selection of which was gradual. GregoryWilliams had a marvellous way of entering a shop and buying everythingwhich pleased his eye at one fell swoop, but Wilbur, who desired toaccomplish the best aesthetic effects possible consistent with hislimited means, trotted Selma from one shop to another before choosing.This process of selecting slowly the things with which they were to passtheir lives was a pleasure to him, and, as he supposed, to Selma. Shedid enjoy keenly at first beholding the enticing contents of the variousstores which they entered in the process of procuring wall-papers,carpets, and the other essentials for house-keeping. It was a revelationto her that such beautiful things existed, and her inclination was topurchase the most showy and the most costly articles. In the adornmentof her former home Babcock had given her a free hand. That is, hisdisposition had been to buy the finest things which the shopkeepers ofBenham called to his attention. She understood now that his taste andthe taste of Benham, and even her's, had been at fault, but she foundherself hampered now by a new and annoying limitation, the smallness oftheir means. Almost every thing was very expensive, and she was obligedto pass by the patterns and materials she desired to possess, and acceptarticles of a more sober and less engaging character. Many of these, tobe sure, were declared by Wilbur to be artistically charming and moresuitable than many which she preferred, but it would have suited herbetter to fix on the rich upholstery and solid furniture, which wereevidently the latest fashion in household decoration, rather than gomousing from place to place, only at last to pick up in the back cornerof some store this or that object which was both reasonably pretty andreasonably cheap. When it was all over Selma was pleased with the effectof her establishment, but she had eaten of the tree of knowledge. Shehad visited the New York shops. These, in her capacity of a God-fearingAmerican, she would have been ready to anathematize in a speech or in anewspaper article, but the memory of them haunted her imagination andleft her domestic yearnings not wholly satisfied.Wilbur Littleton's scheme of domestic life was essentially spiritual,and in the development of it he felt that he was consulting his wife'stastes and theories no less than his own. He knew that she understoodthat he was ambitious to make a name for himself as an architect; but tomake it only by virtue of work of a high order; that he was unwilling tobecome a time-server or to lower his professional standards merely tomake temporary progress, which in the end would mar a success worthhaving. He had no doubt that he had made this clear to her and that shesympathized with him. As a married man it was his desire and intentionnot to allow his interest in this ambition to interfere with theenjoyment of the new great happiness which had come into his life. Hewould be a professional recluse no longer. He would cast off his workwhen he left his office, and devote his evenings to the aestheticdelights of Selma's society. They would read aloud; he would tell herhis plans and ask her advice; they would go now and then to the theatre;and, in justice to her, they would occasionally entertain their friendsand accept invitations from them. With this outlook in mind he had madesuch an outlay as would render his home attractive and cosey--simple asbecame a couple just beginning life, yet the abode of a gentleman and alover of inspiring and pretty things.As has been mentioned, Littleton was a Unitarian, and one effect of hisfaith had been to make his point of view broad and straightforward. Hedetested hypocrisy and cant, subterfuge and self-delusion. He wascontent to let other people live according to their own lights withouttoo much distress on their account, but he was too honest and tooclear-headed to be able to deceive himself as to his own motives and hisown conduct. He had no intention to be morbid, but he saw clearly thatit was his privilege and his duty to be true to both his loves, his wifeand his profession, and that if he neglected either, he would be so farfalse to his best needs and aspirations. Yet he felt that for the momentit was incumbent on him to err on the side of devotion to his wife untilshe should become accustomed to her new surroundings.The problem of the proper arrangement and subdivision of life in a largecity and in these seething, modern times is perplexing to all of us.There are so many things we would like to do which we cannot; so manythings which we do against our wills. We are perpetually squinting athappiness, but just as we get a delightful vision before our eyes we arewhisked off by duty or ambition or the force of social momentum to try adifferent view. Consequently our perennial regret is apt to be that wehave seen our real interests and our real friends as in a panorama, fora fleeting moment, and then no more until the next time. For Littletonthis was less true than for most. His life was deep and stable ratherthan many-sided. To be sure his brain experienced, now and then, thedazing effects of trying to confront all the problems of the universeand adapt his architectural endeavors to his interpretation of them; andhe knew well the bewildering difficulties of the process of adjustingprofessional theories to the sterile conditions which workaday practiceoften presented. But this crowding of his mental canvas was all in theline of his life purpose. The days were too short, and sometimes lefthim perplexed and harassed by their rush; yet he was still pursuing thetenor of his way. The interest of marriage was not, therefore, in hiscase a fresh burden on a soul already laden with a variety of sidepursuits. He was neither socially nor philanthropically active; he wasnot a club man, nor an athletic enthusiast; he was on no committees; hevoted on election days, but he did not take an active part in politics.For Selma's sake all this must be changed; and he was glad toacknowledge that he owed it to himself as well as to her to widen hissympathies.As a first step in reform he began to leave his office daily at fiveinstead of six, and, on Saturdays, as soon after two as possible. For afew months these brands of time snatched from the furnace of hisprofessional ardor were devoted to the shopping relative tohouse-furnishing. When that was over, to walking with Selma; sometimesas a sheer round of exercise in company, sometimes to visit aprint-shop, exhibition of pictures, book-store, or other attraction ofthe hour. But the evening was for him the ideal portion of the day;when, after dinner was done, they made themselves comfortable in the newlibrary, their living room, and it became his privilege to read aloud toher or to compare ideas with her regarding books and pictures and whatwas going on in the world. It had been a dream of Littleton's that someday he would re-read consecutively the British poets, and as soon as thefurniture was all in place and the questions of choice of rugs andchairs and pictures had been settled by purchase, he proposed it as adefinite occupation whenever they had nothing else in view. It delightedhim that Selma received this suggestion with enthusiasm. Accordingly,they devoted their spare evenings to the undertaking, reading aloud inturn. Littleton's enunciation was clear and intelligent, and as a happylover he was in a mood to fit poetic thoughts to his own experience, andto utter them ardently. While he read, Selma knew that she was ever theheroine of his imagination, which was agreeable, and she recognizedbesides that his performance in itself was aesthetically attractive. Yetin spite of the personal tribute, Selma preferred the evenings when sheherself was the elocutionist. She enjoyed the sound of her own voice,and she enjoyed the emotions which her utterance of the rhythmic stanzasset coursing through her brain. It was obvious to her that Wilbur wascaptivated by her reading, and she delighted in giving herself up to thespirit of the text with the reservations appropriate to an enlightenedbut virtuous soul. For instance, in the case of Shelley, she gloried inhis soaring, but did not let herself forget that fire-worship was notpractical; in the case of Byron, though she yielded her senses to thespell of his passionate imagery, she reflected approvingly that she wasa married woman.But Littleton appreciated also that his wife should have the society ofothers beside himself. Pauline introduced her promptly to her own smallbut intelligent feminine circle, and pending Pauline's removal to aflat, the Saturday evening suppers were maintained at the oldestablishment. Here Selma made the acquaintance of her husband's and hissister's friends, both men and women, who dropped in often after theplay and without ceremony for a weekly interchange of thought andcomradeship. Selma looked forward to the first of these occasions withan eager curiosity. She expected a renewal of the Benham Institute, onlyin a more impressive form, as befitted a great literary centre; thatpapers would be read, original compositions recited, and manyinteresting people of both sexes perform according to their specialties.She confidently hoped to have the opportunity to declaim, "Oh, whyshould the spirit of mortal be proud?" "Curfew must not ring to-night,"or some other of her literary pieces.Therefore, it was almost a shock to her that the affair was so informal,and that the company seemed chiefly occupied in behaving gayly--inmaking sallies at each other's expense, which were greeted withmerriment. They seemed to her like a lot of children let loose fromschool. There were no exercises, and no allusion was made to theattainments of the various guests beyond an occasional word ofintroduction by Pauline or Wilbur; and this word was apt to be ofserio-comic import. Selma realized that among the fifteen people presentthere were representatives of various interesting crafts--writers,artists, a magazine editor, two critics of the stage, a prominentmusician, and a college professor--but none of them seemed to her to acta part or to have their accomplishments in evidence, as she would haveliked. Every one was very cordial to her, and appeared desirous torecognize her as a permanent member of their circle, but she could nothelp feeling disappointed at the absence of ceremony and formal events.There was no president or secretary, and presently the party went intothe dining-room and sat around a table, at either end of which Paulineand Wilbur presided over a blazer. Interest centred on the preparationof a rabbit and creamed oysters, and pleasant badinage flew from tongueto tongue. Selma found herself between the magazine editor and a large,powerfully built man with a broad, rotund, strong face, who wasintroduced to her as Dr. Page, and who was called George by every oneelse. He had arrived late, just as they were going in to supper, and hisappearance had been greeted with a murmur of satisfaction. He had placedhimself between Pauline and her, and he showed himself, to Selma'sthinking, one of the least dignified of the company."My dear Mrs. Littleton," he said, with a counterfeit of great gravity,"you are now witnessing an impressive example of the politeness of truefriendship. There are cynics who assert that the American people arelacking in courtesy, and cast in our teeth the superiority of Japanesemanners. I wish they were here to-night. There is not a singleindividual present, male or female, married or single, who does notsecretly cherish the amiable belief that he or she can cook things on ablazer better than any one else. And yet we abstain from criticism; weoffer no suggestions; we accept, without a murmur, the proportions ofcheese and beer and butter inflicted upon us by our hostess and herbrother, and are silent. We shall even become complimentary later. Canthe Japanese vie with this?"The contrast between his eager, grave gaze, and the levity of his words,puzzled Selma. He looked interesting, but his speech seemed to hertrivial and unworthy of the occasion. Still she appreciated that shemust not be a spoil-sport, and that it was incumbent on her to resignherself to the situation, so she smiled gayly, and said: "I am the onlyone then not suffering from self-restraint. I never made a Welsh rabbit,nor cooked on a blazer." Then, in her desire for more seriousconversation, she added: "Do you really think that we, as a people, areless polite than the Japanese?"The doctor regarded her with solemn interest for an instant, as thoughhe were pondering the question. As a matter of fact, he was thinkingthat she was remarkably pretty. Then he put his finger on his lips, andin a hoarse whisper, said, "Sh! Be careful. If the editorial ear shouldcatch your proposition the editorial man would appropriate it. There!"he added, as her left-hand neighbor bent toward them in response to thesummons, "he has heard, and your opportunity to sell an idea to themagazine is lost. It is all very fine for him to protest that he hasheard nothing. That is a trick of his trade. Let us see now if he willagree to buy. If he refuses, it will be a clear case that he has heardand purloined it. Come, Dennison, here's a chance for a tenthousand-word symposium debate, 'Are we, as a nation, less polite thanthe Japanese?' We offer it for a hundred and fifty cash, and cheap atthe price."Mr. Dennison, who was a keen-eyed, quiet man, with a brown, closely-cutbeard, had paused in his occupation of buttering hot toast for theimpending rabbit, and was smiling quizzically. "If you have literarysecrets to dispose of, Mrs. Littleton, let me warn you against making aconfidant of Dr. Page. Had you spoken to me first, there is no knowingwhat I might have--""What did I tell you?" broke in the doctor. "A one hundred andfifty-dollar idea ruthlessly appropriated. These editors, theseeditors!"It was tantalizing to Selma to be skirting the edge of themes she wouldhave enjoyed to hear treated seriously. She hoped that Mr. Dennisonwould inquire if she really wrote, and at least he would tell hersomething about his magazine and literary life in New York. But he tookup again his task of buttering toast, and sought to interest her inthat. Presently she was unable to resist the temptation of remarkingthat the editorship of a magazine must be one of the most interesting ofall occupations; but he looked at her with his quizzical smile, andanswered:"Between you and me, Mrs. Littleton, I will confide to you that aconsiderable portion of the time it is a confounded bore. To tell thetruth, I much prefer to sit next to you and butter toast."This was depressing and puzzling to Selma; but after the consumption ofthe rabbit and the oysters there was some improvement in the generaltone of the conversation. Yet, not so far as she was concerned. Mr.Dennison neglected to confide to her the secrets of his prison house,and Dr. Page ruthlessly refused to discuss medicine, philosophy, or theJapanese. But here and there allusion was made by one or another of thecompany to something which had been done in the world of letters, orart, or music, which possessed merit or deserved discouragement. Whatwas said was uttered simply, often trenchantly and lightly, but never asa dogma, or with the solemnity which Mrs. Earle had been wont to impartto her opinions. Just as the party was about to break up, Dr. Pageapproached Selma and offered her his hand. "It is a great pleasure to meto have met you," he said, looking into her face with his honest eyes."A good wife was just what Wilbur needed to insure him happiness and afine career. His friends have great confidence in his ability, and weintrust him to you in the belief that the world will hear from him--andI, for one, shall be very grateful to you."He spoke now with evident feeling, and his manner suggested the desireto be her friend. Selma admired his large physique and felt theattraction of his searching gaze."Perhaps he did need a wife," she answered with an attempt at thesprightliness which he had laid aside. "I shall try not to let him betoo indifferent to practical considerations."CHAPTER III."Who is Dr. Page?" asked Selma of her husband when they left the house."One of our best friends, and one of the leading physicians in the city.The energy of that man is tireless. He is absorbed in his profession.The only respite he allows himself are these Saturday evenings, and hisdevotion to his little son who has hip disease. He told me to-night thathe had finished his day's work only just before he came in. What did youthink of him? He likes to tease.""Then he is married?""He is a widower.""He seems interested in you. He was good enough to say that he thoughtyou needed a wife.""Then he must have admired you, Selma. Poor fellow! I wish he might havethat happiness himself. I'll tell you a secret: He has desired to marryPauline for years. They are devoted friends--but until now that is all.His wife was an actress--a handsome creature. Two years after they weremarried she ran away with another man and left him. Left him with onelittle boy, a cripple, on whom he lavishes all the love of his bignature.""How dreadful!""Yes, it is a sad story. That was ten years ago. He was very young andthe woman was very beautiful. It has been the making of him, though, inone way. He had the pride and confidence of ability, but he lackedsympathy. His experience and the appealing presence of his son havedeveloped his nature and given him tenderness. He has not beenimbittered; he has simply become gentle. And how he works! He is alreadyfamous in his profession.""Does Pauline care for him?""I don't know her feelings. I am sure she is fond of him, and admireshim. I fancy, though, that she hesitates to renounce her own ambitions.As you are aware, she is greatly interested in her classes, and inmatters pertaining to the higher education of women. George Page knewher at the time of his marriage. I do not mean that he paid her seriousattention then, but he had the opportunity to ask her instead of theother. Now, when she has become absorbed in her life-work, she wouldnaturally decline to give it up unless she felt sure that she could notbe happy without him.""I would not marry him if I were she," said Selma. "He has given hisbest to the other woman. He is the one at fault, not Pauline. Why shouldshe sacrifice her own career in order to console him?""She might love him sufficiently to be willing to do so, Selma. Lovemakes women blind to faults. But poor George was scarcely at fault. Itwas a misfortune.""He made his choice and was deceived. It would be weak of her to give upher own life merely because he is lonely. We modern women have too muchself-respect for that. Love is love, and it is not to be trifled with.""Yes, love is love," murmured Littleton, "and I am happy in mine.""That is because neither of us has loved before, you foolish boy. But asto this evening, it wasn't at all what I expected. Are your friendsalways like that?"Littleton laughed. "Did they seem to you frivolous and undignified,then?""Almost. They certainly said nothing serious.""It is their holiday--their evening out. They have to be serious duringthe rest of the week--busy with problems and cares, for they are a setof hard workers. The stress of life is so rigorous and constant here inNew York that we have learned not to take our pleasure sadly. When youbecome accustomed to their way you will realize that they are no lessserious at heart because they frolic now and then."Selma was silent a moment; then she said, "That reminds me; have youfound out about our next-door neighbors yet?""He is a banker named Williams, I believe.""I saw his wife pass the window this morning. She was beautifullydressed. They must be rich.""I dare say.""But they live in the same style of house as ours.""Bankers have mysterious ways of making money. We cannot compete withthose.""I suppose not. I was thinking that she had the same manner as some ofyour friends this evening, only more pronounced. She stopped to speak tosome one just in front of the house, so I could observe her. I shouldthink she was frivolous, but fascinating. That must be the New Yorkmanner, and, consequently, she may be very much in earnest.""It isn't given to every woman to be attractive all the time justbecause she looks in earnest, as it is to you, dearest. But you musn'tbe too severe on the others.""On the contrary, I think I shall like Mrs. Williams. She may teach usto be practical. You know that is what your friends would like to haveme help you to be, Wilbur.""Then they did talk a word or two of sense?""They said that. Do you think it is true that you are visionary?""It is your duty to tell me so, Selma, when you think it, just as I havetold you that we can afford to laugh now and then. Come, begin.""I haven't been your wife long enough yet. I shall know better by theend of another six months."A fortnight elapsed before Selma made the acquaintance of Mrs. GregoryWilliams. It was not a chance meeting. Flossy rang the bell deliberatelyone afternoon and was ushered in, thereby bridging over summarily theyawning chasm which may continue to exist for an indefinite periodbetween families in the same block who are waiting to be introduced."I said to my husband last night, Mrs. Littleton, that it was ridiculousfor us to be living side by side without knowing one another, and that Iwas going to call. We moved in three weeks before you, so I'm the onewho ought to break the ice. Otherwise we might have stared at each otherblankly for three months, looked at each other sheepishly out of thecorner of our eyes for another three, half bowed for six months, andfinally, perhaps, reached the stage where we are now. Neighbors shouldbe neighborly, don't you think so?""Indeed I do. Of course I knew you by sight; and I felt I should like tomake your acquaintance." Selma spoke with enthusiasm. Here was some onewhose social deftness was no less marked than Mrs. Hallett Taylor's,and, to her mind, more brilliant, yet whom she felt at once to becongenial. Though she perceived that her neighbor's clothes made her ownapparel seem dull, and was accordingly disposed to be on her guard, sherealized instinctively that she was attracted by the visitor."That is very nice of you," said Flossy. "I told myhusband--Gregory--the other day that I was sure you were somethingliterary--I mean Mr. Littleton, of course--and when he found out that hewas I said we must certainly cultivate you as an antidote to the bankingbusiness. Gregory's a banker. It must be delightful to plan houses. Thisroom is so pretty and tasteful.""It isn't wholly furnished yet. We are buying things by degrees, as wefind pieces which we like.""We bought all our things in two days at one fell swoop," said Flossywith a gay laugh. "Gregory gave the dealers carte blanche. That's hisway," she added with a touch of pride. "I dare say the house would havebeen prettier if we could have taken more time. However, it is all paidfor now. Some of it was bought on the instalment plan, but Gregorybought or sold something in stocks the next week which covered thefurniture and paid for a present for me of this besides," she said,indicating her seal-skin cape. "Wasn't he a dear?"Selma did not know precisely what the instalment plan was, but sheunderstood that Mr. Williams had been distinctly clever in his wife'sestimation. She perceived that Mrs. Williams had the same light, halfjocular manner displayed by Wilbur's friends, and that she spoke withbubbling, jaunty assurance, which was suggestive of frivolity. StillWilbur had intimated that this might be the New York manner, and clearlyher neighbor had come in a friendly spirit and was duly appreciative ofthe distinction of being literary. Besides, her ready disposition totalk about herself and her affairs seemed to Selma the sign of awillingness to be truly friendly. The seal-skin cape she wore was veryhandsome, and she was more conspicuously attired from head to foot thanany woman with whom Selma had ever conversed. She was pretty, too--atype of beauty less spiritual than her own--with piquant, eagerfeatures, laughing, restless gray eyes, and light hair which escapedfrom her coquettish bonnet in airy ringlets. If they had met three yearsearlier Selma would certainly have regarded her as an incarnation ofvolatility and servility to foreign fashions. Now, though she classedher promptly as a frivolous person, she regarded her with a keencuriosity not unmixed with self-distress, and the reflection came to herthat a little of the New York manner might perhaps be desirable when inNew York."Yes, it's beautiful," she replied, referring to the cape."Gregory is always making me presents like that. He gave me thisbracelet yesterday. He saw it in the shop-window and went in and boughtit. Speaking of husbands, you won't mind my saying that I think Mr.Littleton is very distinguished looking? I often see him pass the windowin the morning.""Of course _I_ think so," said Selma. "I suppose it would seem flat if Iwere to say that I admired Mr. Williams's appearance also.""The truth is no harm. Wouldn't it be nice if we should happen to becomefriends? We are the pioneers in this block, but I hear three otherhouses have been sold. I suppose you own your house?""I believe not. We have a lease of it.""That's a pity, because Gregory bought ours on a mortgage, thinking theland is sure to become more valuable. He hopes to be able to sell someday for a great deal more than he paid for it. May I ask where you livedbefore you were married?"Selma told her briefly."Then you are almost Western. I felt sure you weren't a New Yorker, andI didn't think you were from Boston. You have the Boston earnestexpression, but somehow you're different. You don't mind my analyzingyou, do you? That's a Boston habit by the way. But I'm not from Boston.I've lived all my life in New Jersey. So we are both strangers in NewYork. That is, I'm the same as a stranger, though my father is a cousinof the Morton Prices. We sent them wedding cards and they called one daywhen I was out. I shall return the call and find them out, and that willbe the last move on either side until Gregory does something remarkable.I'm rather glad I wasn't at home, because it would have been awkward.They wouldn't have known what to say to me, and they might have feltthat they ought to ask me to dinner, and I don't care to have them askme until they're obliged to. Do I shock you running on so about my ownaffairs?" Flossy asked, noticing Selma draw herself up sternly."Oh no, I like that. I was only thinking that it was very strange ofyour cousins. You are as good as they, aren't you?""Mercy, no. We both know it, and that's what makes the situation soawkward. As Christians, they had to call on me, but I really think theyare justified in stopping there. Socially I'm nobody.""In this country we are all free and equal.""You're a dear--a delicious dear," retorted Flossy, with a caressinglaugh. "There's something of the sort in the Declaration ofIndependence, but, as Gregory says, that was put in as a bluff toconsole salesladies. Was everybody equal in Benham, Mrs. Littleton?""Practically so," said Selma, with an air of haughtiness, which wasevoked by her recollection of the group of houses on Benham's RiverDrive into which she had never been invited. "There were some people whowere richer than others, but that didn't make them better than any oneelse.""Well, in New York it's different. Of course, every body has the sameright to vote or to be elected President of the United States, butequality ends there. People here are either in society or out of it, andsociety itself is divided into sets. There's the conservativearistocratic set, the smart rapid set, the set which hasn't much money,but has Knickerbocker or other highly respectable ancestors, the newmillionaire set, the literary set, the intellectual philanthropic set,and so on, according to one's means or tastes. Each has its littlecircle which shades away into the others, and every now and then thereis a big entertainment to which they all go.""I see," said Selma, coldly."Now, to make it plain, I will confide to you in strictest confidencethat Gregory and I aren't yet really in any set. We are trying to get afooting and are holding on by our teeth to the fringe of the socialmerry-go-round. I wouldn't admit it to any one but you; but as you are astranger like myself and in the same block, I am glad to initiate youinto the customs of this part of the country," Flossy gave a merry tossto her head which set her ringlets bobbing, and rose to go."And in what set are your cousins?" asked Selma."If you wish to hear about them, I shall have to sit down again. TheMorton-Prices belong to the ultra-conservative, solid, stupid,aristocratic set--the most dignified and august of all. They are almostas sacred as Hindoo gods, and some people would walk over red-hot coalsto gain admission to their house. And really, it's quite just in one waythat incense should be burnt before them. You mustn't look so disgusted,because there's some sense in it all. As Gregory says, it's best to lookthings squarely in the face. Most of the people in these different setsare somebodies because either their grandfathers or they have donesomething well--better than other people, and made money as aconsequence. And when a family has made money or won distinction by itsbrains and then has brushed its teeth twice a day religiously for twogenerations, the members of it, even though dull, are entitled torespect, don't you think so?"Selma, who brushed her teeth but once a day, looked a little sharp atFlossy."It makes money of too much importance and it establishes classdistinctions. I don't approve of such a condition of affairs at all."Flossy shrugged her shoulders. "I have never thought whether I approveof it or not. I am only telling you what exists. I don't deny that moneycounts for a great deal, for, as Gregory says, money is the measure ofsuccess. But money isn't everything. Brains count and refinement, andnice honorable ways of looking at things. Of course, I'm only tellingyou what my ambition is. People have different kinds of bees in theirbonnets. Some men have the presidential bee; I have the social bee. Ishould like to be recognized as a prominent member of the charmed circleon my own merits and show my cousins that I am really worthy of theirattention. There are a few who are able to be superior to that sort ofthing, who go on living their own lives attractively and finely, withoutthinking of society, and who suddenly wake up some day to findthemselves socially famous--to find that they have been taken up. That'sthe best way, but one requires to be the right sort of person and tohave a lot of moral courage. I can imagine it happening to you and yourhusband. But it would never happen to Gregory and me. We shall have tomake money and cut a dash in order to attract attention, and by-and-by,if we are persistent and clever enough, we may be recognized assomebodies, provided there is something original or interesting aboutus. There! I have told you my secret and shocked you into the bargain. Ireally must be going. But I'll tell you another secret first: It'll be apleasure to me to see you, if I may, because you look at thingsdifferently and haven't a social bee. I wish I were like that--reallylike it. But then, as Gregory would say, I shouldn't be myself, and notto be one's self is worse than anything else after all, isn't it? Youand your husband must come and dine with us soon."After Mrs. Williams had gone, Selma fell into a brown study. She hadlistened to sentiments of which she thoroughly disapproved, and whichwere at variance with all her theories and conceptions. What herfriendly, frivolous visitor had told her with engaging franknessoffended her conscience and patriotism. She did not choose to admit theexistence of these class-distinctions, and she knew that even if theydid exist, they could not possibly concern Wilbur and herself. Even Mrs.Williams had appreciated that Wilbur and her literary superiority putthem above and beyond the application of any snobbish, artificial,social measuring-tape. And yet Selma's brow was clouded. Her thoughtreverted to the row of stately houses on either side of Fifth Avenue,into none of which she had the right of free access, in spite of thefact that she was leading her life attractively and finely, withoutregard to society. She thought instinctively of Sodom and Gomorrah, andshe saw righteously with her mind's eye for a moment an angel with aflaming sword consigning to destruction these offending mansions andtheir owners as symbols of mammon and contraband to God.That evening she told Wilbur of Mrs. Williams's visit. "She's a bright,amusing person, and quite pretty. We took a fancy to each other. Butwhat do you suppose she said? She intimated that we haven't any socialposition.""Very kind of her, I'm sure. She must be a woman ofdiscrimination--likewise something of a character.""She's smart. So you think it's true?""What? About our social position? Ours is as good as theirs, I fancy.""Oh yes, Wilbur. She acknowledges that herself. She admires us both andshe thinks it fine that we don't care for that sort of thing. What shesaid was chiefly in connection with herself, but she intimated thatneither they, nor we, are the--er--equals of the people who live onFifth Avenue and thereabouts. She's a cousin of the Morton Prices,whoever they may be, and she declared perfectly frankly that they werebetter than she. Wasn't it funny?""You seem to have made considerable progress for one visit.""I like that, you know, Wilbur. I prefer people who are willing to tellme their real feelings at once.""Morton Price is one of the big bugs. His great grandfather was amongthe wise, shrewd pioneers in the commercial progress of the city. Thepresent generation are eminently respectable, very dignified, mildlyphilanthropic, somewhat self-indulgent, reasonably harmless, decidedlyornamental and rather dull.""But Mrs. Williams says that she will never be happy until her relationsand the people of that set are obliged to take notice of her, and thatshe and her husband are going to cut a dash to attract attention. It'sher secret.""The cat which she let out of the bag is a familiar one. She must beamusing, provided she is not vulgar.""I don't think she's vulgar, Wilbur. She wears gorgeous clothes, butthey're extremely pretty. She said that she called on me because shethought that we were literary, and that she desired an antidote to thebanker's business, which shows she isn't altogether worldly. She wishesus to dine with them soon.""That's neighborly.""Why was it, Wilbur, that you didn't buy our house instead of hiringit?""Because I hadn't money enough to pay for it.""The Williamses bought theirs. But I don't believe they paid for italtogether. She says her husband thinks the land will increase in value,and they hope some day to make money by the rise. I imagine Mr. Williamsmust be shrewd.""He's a business man. Probably he bought, and gave a mortgage back. Imight have done that, but we weren't sure we should like the location,and it isn't certain yet that fashion will move in just this direction.I have very little, and I preferred not to tie up everything in a housewe might not wish to keep.""I see. She appreciates that people may take us up any time. She thinksyou are distinguished looking.""If she isn't careful, I shall make you jealous, Selma. Was thereanything you didn't discuss?""I regard you as the peer of any Morton Price alive. Why aren't you?""Far be it from me to discourage such a wifely conclusion. Provided youthink so, I don't care for any one else's opinion.""But you agree with her. That is, you consider because people of thatsort don't invite us to their houses, they are better than we.""Nothing of the kind. But there's no use denying the existence of socialclasses in this city, and that, though I flatter myself you and I aretrying to make the most of our lives in accordance with the talents andmeans at our disposal, we are not and are not likely to become, for thepresent at any rate, socially prominent. That's what you have in mind, Ithink. I don't know those people; they don't know me. Consequently theydo not ask me to their beautiful and costly entertainments. Some day,perhaps, if I am very successful as an architect, we may come more incontact with them, and they will have a chance to discover what acharming wife I have. But from the point of view of society, yourneighbor Mrs. Williams is right. She evidently has a clear head on hershoulders and knows what she desires. You and I believe that we can getmore happiness out of life by pursuing the even tenor of our way in theposition in which we happen to find ourselves.""I don't understand it," said Selma, shaking her head and looking intospace with her spiritual expression. "It troubles me. It isn't American.I didn't think such distinctions existed in this country. Is it all aquestion of money, then? Do intelligence and--er--purpose count fornothing?""My dear girl, it simply means that the people who are on top--thepeople who, by force of success, or ability, or money, are mostprominent in the community, associate together, and the world gives acertain prominence to their doings. Here, where fortunes have been madeso rapidly, and we have no formal aristocracy, money undoubtedly plays aconspicuous part in giving access to what is known as society. But it isonly an entering wedge. Money supplies the means to cultivate mannersand the right way of looking at things, and good society represents thebest manners and, on the whole, the best way of looking at things.""Yes. But you say that we don't belong to it.""We do in the broad, but not in the narrow sense. We have neither themeans nor the time to take part in fashionable society. Surely, Selma,you have no such ambition?""I? You know I disapprove of everything of the sort. It is like Europe.There's nothing American in it.""I don't know about that. The people concerned in it are Americans. If aman has made money there is no reason why he shouldn't build a handsomehouse, maintain a fine establishment, give his children the besteducational advantages, and choose his own friends. So the nextgeneration becomes more civilized. It isn't the best Americanism towaste one's time in pursuing frivolities and excessive luxury, as someof these people do; but there's nothing un-American in making the mostof one's opportunities. As I've said to you before, Selma, it's the wayin which one rises that's the important thing in the individualequation, and every man must choose for himself what that shall be. Myambition is to excel in my profession, and to mould my life to that endwithout neglecting my duties as a citizen or a husband. If, in the end,I win fame and fortune, so much the better. But there's no use inworrying because other people are more fashionable than we.""Of course. You speak as if you thought I was envious of them, Wilbur.What I don't understand is why such people should be allowed to exist inthis country.""We're a free people, Selma. I'm a good democrat, but you must agreethat the day-laborer in his muddy garb would not find himself at ease ina Fifth Avenue drawing-room. On that account shall we abolish thedrawing-room?""We are not day-laborers.""Not precisely; but we have our spurs to win. And, unlike some people inour respectable, but humble station, we have each other's love to giveus courage to fight the battle of life bravely. I had a fresh orderto-day--and I have bought tickets for to-night at the theatre."CHAPTER IV.Almost the first persons at the theatre on whom Selma's eyes rested werethe Gregory Williamses. They were in a box with two other people, andboth Flossy and her husband were talking with the festive air peculiarto those who are willing to be noticed and conscious that their wish isbeing gratified. Flossy wore a gay bonnet and a stylish frock,supplemented by a huge bunch of violets, and her husband's evening dressbetrayed a slight exaggeration of the prevailing fashion in respect tohis standing collar and necktie. Selma had never had a thorough look athim before, and she reflected that he was decidedly impressive andhandsome. His face was full and pleasant, his mustache large andgracefully curved, and his figure manly. His most distinguishingcharacteristic was a dignity of bearing uncommon in so young a man,suggesting that he carried, if not the destiny of republics on hisshoulders, at least, important financial secrets in his brain. The manand woman with them were almost elderly and gave the effect of beingstrangers to the city. They were Mr. and Mrs. Silas S. Parsons. Mr.Parsons was a prosperous Western business man, who now and then visitedNew York, and who had recently become a customer of Williams's. He haddealt in the office where Williams was a clerk, and, having taken afancy to him, was disposed to help the new firm. Gregory had invitedthem to dinner and to the theatre, by way of being attentive, and hadtaken a box instead of stalls, in order to make his civility asmagnificent as the occasion would permit. A box, besides being adelicate testimonial to his guest, would cause the audience to noticehim and his wife and to ask who they were.In the gradual development of the social appetite in this country acertain class has been evolved whose drawing-room is the floor of theleading theatres. Society consists for them chiefly in being presentoften at theatrical performances in sumptuous dress, not merely towitness the play, but to be participants in a social function whichenhances their self-esteem. To be looked at and to look on theseoccasions takes the place with them of balls and dinner parties. Theyare not theatregoers in the proper sense, but social aspirants, and theboxes and stalls are for them an arena in which for a price they canshow themselves in their finery and attractions, for lack of otheropportunities.Our theatres are now in the full blaze of this harmless appropriationfor quasi-ballroom uses. At the time when Selma was a New York bride themovement was in its infancy. The people who went to the theatre forspectacular purposes no less than to see the actors on the stage werecomparatively few in number. Still the device was practised, and fromthe very fact that it was not freely employed, was apt to dazzle theeyes of the uninitiated public more unreservedly than to-day. The sightof Mrs. Williams in a box, in the glory of her becoming frock and herviolets, caused even so stern a patriot and admirer of simplicity asSelma to seize her husband's arm and whisper:"Look." What is more she caught herself a moment later blushing withsatisfaction on account of the friendly bow which was bestowed on her.Wilbur Littleton's ambitions were so definite and congenial that thesight of his neighbors' splendor neither offended nor irritated him. Hedid not feel obliged to pass judgment on them while deriving amusementfrom their display, nor did he experience any qualms of regret that hewas not able to imitate them. He regarded Flossy and her husband withthe tolerant gaze of one content to allow other people to work out theirsalvation, without officious criticism, provided he were allowed thesame privilege, and ready to enjoy any features of the situation whichappealed to his sense of humor or to his human sympathy. Flossy's frank,open nod and ingenuous face won his favor at once, especially as heappreciated that she and Selma had found each other attractive, andthough he tabooed luxury and fashionable paraphernalia where he wasimmediately concerned, it occurred to him that this evidentlywide-awake, vivacious-looking couple might, as friends, introduce justthe right element of variety into their lives. He had no wish to be abanker himself, nor to hire boxes at the theatre, but he was disposed tomeet half-way these entertaining and gorgeous neighbors.Selma, in spite of her wish to watch the play, found her glancereturning again and again to the occupants of the box, though sheendeavored to dispose of the matter by remarking presently that shecould not understand why people should care to make themselves soconspicuous, particularly as the seats in the boxes were less desirablefor seeing the stage than their own."We wouldn't care for it, but probably it's just what they like," saidWilbur. "Some society reporter may notice them; in which case we shallsee in the Sunday newspaper that Mr. Gregory Williams and party occupieda private box at the Empire Theatre last Tuesday evening, which will beanother straw toward helping them to carry out their project ofattracting attention. I like the face of your new friend, my dear. Imean to say that she looks unaffected and honest, and as if she had asense of humor. With those three virtues a woman can afford to have somefaults. I suppose she has hers."Littleton felt that Selma was disposed to fancy her neighbor, but wasrestrained by conscientious scruples due to her dislike for societyconcerns. He had fallen in love with and married his wife because hebelieved her to be free from and superior to the petty weaknesses of thefeminine social creed; but though extremely proud of her uncompromisingstandards, he had begun to fear lest she might indulge her point of viewso far as to be unjust. Her scornful references from time to time tothose who had made money and occupied fine houses had wounded his ownsense of justice. He had endeavored to explain that virtue was not theexclusive prerogative of the noble-minded poor, and now he welcomed anopportunity of letting her realize from personal experience that societywas not so bad as it was painted.Selma returned Mrs. Williams's call during the week, but did not findher at home. A few days later arrived a note stamped with a purple andgold monogram inviting them to dinner. When the evening arrived theyfound only a party of four. A third couple had given out at the lastminute, so they were alone with their hosts. The Williams house in itsdecoration and upholstery was very different from their own. Thedrawing-room was bright with color. The furniture was covered with lightblue plush; there were blue and yellow curtains, gay cushions, and aprofusion of gilt ornamentation. A bear-skin, a show picture on aneasel, and a variety of florid bric-a-brac completed the brilliantaspect of the apartment. Selma reflected at once that that this was thesort of drawing-room which would have pleased her had she been given herhead and a full purse. It suggested her home at Benham refurnished bythe light of her later experience undimmed by the shadow of economy. Onthe way down to dinner she noticed in the corner of the hall a suit ofold armor, and she was able to perceive that the little room on one sideof the front door, which they learned subsequently was Mr. Williams'sden, contained Japanese curiosities. The dinner-table shone with glassand silver ware, and was lighted by four candles screened by small pinkshades. By the side of Flossy's plate and her own was a small bunch ofviolets, and there was a rosebud for each of the men. The dinner, whichwas elaborate, was served by two trig maids. There were champagne andfrozen pudding. Selma felt almost as if she were in fairy-land. She hadnever experienced anything just like this before; but her exactingconscience was kept at bay by the reflection that this must be a furthermanifestation of the New York manner, and her self-respect waspropitiated by the cordiality of her entertainers. The conversation wasbubbling and light-hearted on the part of both Mr. and Mrs. Williams.They kept up a running prattle on the current fads of the day, thetheatre, the doings of well-known social personages, and their ownhousehold possessions, which they naively called to the attention oftheir guests, that they might be admired. But Selma enjoyed more thanthe general conversation her talk with the master of the house, whopossessed all the friendly suavity of his wife and also the valuablemasculine trait of seeming to be utterly absorbed in any woman to whomhe was talking. Gregory had a great deal of manner and a confidentialfluency of style, which gave distinction even to commonplace remarks.His method did not condescend to nudging when he wished to note a point,but it fell only so far short of it as he thought social elegancerequired. His conversation presently drifted, or more properly speaking,flowed into a graphic and frank account of his own progress as a banker.He referred to past successful undertakings, descanted on his presentroseate responsibilities, and hinted sagely at impending operationswhich would eclipse in importance any in which he had hitherto beenengaged. In answer to Selma's questions he discoursed alluringlyconcerning the methods of the Stock Exchange, and gave her to understandthat for an intelligent and enterprising man speculation was the highroad to fortune. No doubt for fools and for people of mediocre or torpidabilities it was a dangerous trade; but for keen and bold intellectswhat pursuit offered such dazzling opportunities?Selma listened, abhorrent yet fascinated. It worried her to be told thatwhat she had been accustomed to regard as gambling should be so quicklyand richly rewarded. Yet the fairy scene around her manifestly confirmedthe prosperous language of her host and left no room for doubt that herneighbors were making brilliant progress. Apparently, too, this businessof speculation and of vast combinations of railroad and other capital,the details of which were very vague to her, was, in his opinion, themost desirable and profitable of callings."Do you know," she said, "that I have been taught to believe that tospeculate in stocks is rather dreadful, and that the people of thecountry don't approve of it." She spoke smilingly, for the leaven of theNew York manner was working, but she could not refrain from testifyingon behalf of righteousness."The people of the country!" exclaimed Gregory, with a smile ofcomplacent amusement. "My dear Mrs. Littleton, you must not let yourselfbe deceived by the Sunday school, Fourth of July, legislative or otherpublic utterances of the American people. It isn't necessary to shout iton the house-tops, but I will confide to you that, whatever they maydeclaim or publish to the contrary, the American people are at heart anation of gamblers. They don't play little horses and other games inpublic for francs, like the French, for the law forbids it, but I don'tbelieve that any one, except we bankers and brokers, realizes how widelyexists the habit of playing the stock-market. Thousands of people, bigand little, sanctimonious and highly respectable, put up their marginsand reap their profits or their losses. Oh no, the country doesn'tapprove of it, especially those who lose. I assure you that the letterswhich pass through the post-office from the godly, freeborn voters inthe rural districts would tell an eloquent story concerning the wishesof the people of the country in regard to speculation."Flossy was rising from table as he finished, so he accompanied the closeof his statement with a sweeping bow which comported with his jauntydignity."I am afraid you are a wicked man. You ought not to slander the Americanpeople like that," Selma answered, pleased as she spoke at the lighttouch which she was able to impart to her speech."It's true. Every word of it is true," he said as she passed him. Headded in a low tone--"I would almost even venture to wager a pair ofgloves that at some time or other your husband has had a finger in thepie.""Never," retorted Selma."What is that Gregory is saying?" interrupted Flossy, putting her arminside Selma's. "I can see by his look that he has been plaguing you.""Yes, he has been trying to shatter my ideals, and now he is trying toinduce me to make an odious bet with him.""Don't, for you would be certain to lose. Gregory is in great lucknowadays.""That is evident, for he has had the good fortune to make theacquaintance of Mrs. Littleton," said Williams gallantly.The two men were left alone with their cigars. After these were lighted,as if he were carrying out his previous train of thought, Gregoryremarked, oracularly, at the end of a puff: "Louisville and Nashville iscertain to sell higher."Littleton looked blank for a moment. He knew so little of stocks that atfirst he did not understand what was meant. Then he said, politely:"Indeed!""It is good for a ten-point rise in my opinion," Williams continuedafter another puff. He was of a liberal nature, and was making a presentof this tip to his guest in the same spirit of hospitality as he hadproffered the dinner and the champagne. He was willing to take forgranted that Littleton, as a gentleman, would give him the order in casehe decided to buy, which would add another customer to his list. But hissuggestion was chiefly disinterested."I'm afraid I know very little about such matters," Littleton respondedwith a smile. "I never owned but ten shares of stock in my life." Then,by way, perhaps, of showing that he was not indifferent to all the goodthings which the occasion afforded, he said, indicating a picture on theopposite wall: "That is a fine piece of color."Williams, having discharged his obligations as a host, was willing toexchange the stock-market as a topic for his own capacity as a lightningappreciator and purchaser of objects of art."Yes," he said, urbanely, "that is a good thing. I saw it in theshop-window, asked the price and bought it. I bought two other picturesat the same time. 'I'll take that, and that, and that,' I said, pointingwith my cane. The dealer looked astonished. He was used, I suppose, tohaving people come in and look at a picture every day for a fortnightbefore deciding. When I like a thing I know it. The three cost meeighteen hundred dollars, and I paid for them within a week by a turn inthe market.""You were very fortunate," said Littleton, who wished to seemsympathetic.Meanwhile the two wives had returned to the drawing-room arm in arm, andestablished themselves on one of those small sofas for two, constructedso that the sitters are face to face. They had taken a strong fancy toeach other, especially Flossy to Selma, and in the half hour whichfollowed they made rapid progress toward intimacy. Before they partedeach had agreed to call the other by her Christian name, and Selma hadconfided the story of her divorce. Flossy listened with absorbedinterest and murmured at the close:"Who would have thought it? You look so pure and gentle and refined thata man must have been a brute to treat you like that. But you are happynow, thank goodness. You have a husband worthy of you."Each had a host of things still unsaid when Littleton and Williamsjoined them."Well, my dear," said Wilbur as they left the house, "that was a sort ofArabian Nights entertainment for us, wasn't it? A little barbaric, buthandsome and well intentioned. I hope it didn't shock you too much.""It struck me as very pleasant, Wilbur. I think I am beginning tounderstand New York a little better. Every thing costs so much here thatit seems necessary to make money, doesn't it? I don't see exactly howpoor people get along. Do you know, Mr. Williams wished to bet me a pairof gloves that you buy stocks sometimes.""He would have lost his bet.""So I told him at once. But he didn't seem to believe me. I was sure younever did. He appears to be very successful; but I let him see that Iknew it was gambling. You consider it gambling, don't you?""Not quite so bad as that. Some stock-brokers are gamblers; but theoccupation of buying and selling stocks for a commission is a wellrecognized and fashionable business.""Mr. Williams thinks that a great many Americans make money instocks--that we are gamblers as a nation.""I am, in my heart, of the same opinion.""Oh, Wilbur. I find you are not so good a patriot as I supposed.""I hate bunkum.""What is that?""Saying things for effect, and professing virtue which we do notpossess."Selma was silent a moment. "What does champagne cost a bottle?""About three dollars and a half.""Do you really think their house barbaric?""It certainly suggests to me heterogeneous barbaric splendor. Theybought their upholstery as they did their pictures, with free-handedself-confidence. Occasionally they made a brilliant shot, but oftenerthey never hit the target at all.""I think I like brighter colors than you do, Wilbur," mused Selma. "Iused to consider things like that as wrong; but I suppose that wasbecause our fathers wished Europe to understand that we disapproved ofthe luxury of courts and the empty lives of the nobility. But if peoplehere with purpose have money, it would seem sensible to furnish theirhouses prettily.""Subject always to the crucifying canons of art," laughed Littleton."I'm glad you're coming round to my view, Selma. Only I deny the abilityof the free-born American, with the overflowing purse, to indulge hisnewly acquired taste for gorgeous effects without professionalassistance.""I suppose so. I can see that their house is crude, though I do thinkthat they have some handsome things. It must be interesting to walkthrough shops and say: 'I'll take that,' just because it pleases you."During her first marriage Selma had found the problem of dollars andcents a simple one. The income of Lewis Babcock was always larger thanthe demands made upon it, and though she kept house and was familiarwith the domestic disbursements, questions of expenditure solvedthemselves readily. She had never been obliged to ask herself whetherthey could afford this or that outlay. Her husband had been only tooeager to give her anything she desired. Consideration of the cost ofthings had seemed to her beneath her notice, and as the concern of theproviding man rather than the thoughtful American wife and mother. Aftershe had been divorced the difficulty in supplying herself readily withmoney had been a dismaying incident of her single life. Dismayingbecause it had seemed to her a limitation unworthy of her aspirationsand abilities. She had married Littleton because she believed him herideal of what a man should be, but she had been glad that he would beable to support her and exempt her from the necessity of asking whatthings cost.By the end of their first year and a half of marriage, Selma realizedthat this necessity still stood, almost like a wolf at the door, betweenher and the free development of her desires and aspirations. New Yorkprices were appalling; the demands of life in New York still more so.They had started house-keeping on a more elaborate scale than she hadbeen used to in Benham. As Mrs. Babcock she had kept one hired girl; butin her new kitchen there were two servants, in deference to the desireof Littleton, who did not wish her to perform the manual work of theestablishment. Men rarely appreciate in advance to the full extent theextra cost of married life, and Littleton, though intending to beprudent, found his bills larger than he had expected. He was able to paythem promptly and without worry, but he was obliged to make evident toSelma that the margin over and above their carefully considered expenseswas very small. The task of watching the butcher's book and theprovision list, and thinking twice before making any new outlay, wassomething she had not bargained for. All through her early life as agirl, the question of money had been kept in the background by thesimplicity of her surroundings. In her country town at home they hadkept no servants. A woman relative had done the work, and she had beenfree to pursue her mental interests and devote herself to her father.She had thought then that the existence of domestic servants was an actof treason against the institutions of the country by those who keptthem. Yet she had accepted, with glee, the hired-girl whom Babcock hadprovided, satisfying her own democratic scruples by dubbing her "help,"and by occasionally offering her a book to read or catechising her as toher moral needs. There is probably no one in the civilized world moreproud of the possession of a domestic servant than the American womanwho has never had one, and no one more prompt to consign her to theobscurity of the kitchen after a feeble pretence at making her feel athome. Selma was delighted to have two instead of one, and, afterbeholding Mrs. Williams's trig maids, was eager to see her own arrayedin white caps and black alpaca dresses. Yet, though she had become keento cultivate the New York manner, and had succeeded in reconciling herconscience to the possession of beautiful things by people with apurpose, it irked her to feel that she was hampered in living up to hernew-found faith by the bugbear of a lean purse. She had expected, asWilbur's wife, to figure quickly and gracefully in the van of New Yorkintellectual and social progress. Instead, she was one among thousands,living in a new and undeveloped locality, unrecognized by the people ofwhom she read in the newspapers, and without opportunities fordisplaying her own individuality and talents. It depressed her to seethe long lines of houses, street after street, and to think that she wasmerely a unit, unknown by name, in this great sea of humanity--she,Selma Littleton, free-born American, conscious of virtue and power. Thismust not be; and she divined clearer and clearer every day that it neednot be if she had more money.It began to be annoying to her that Wilbur's professional progress wasnot more rapid. To be sure he had warned her that he could not hope toreach the front rank at once; that recognition must be gradual; and thathe must needs work slowly in order to do himself justice. She hadaccepted this chiefly as a manifestation of modesty, not doubting thatmany orders would be forthcoming, especially now that he had the newstimulus of her love and inspiration. Instead there had been no markedincrease in the number of his commissions; moreover he had beenunsuccessful in two out of three competitions for minor public buildingsfor which he had submitted designs. From both the pecuniary andprofessional point of view these failures had been a disappointment. Hewas in good spirits and obviously happy, and declared that he was doingas well as he could reasonably expect; yet on his discouraged days headmitted that the cost of retaining his draughtsmen was a drain on theprofit side of his ledger.In contrast with this the prosperity of her neighbors the Williamses wasa little hard to bear. The sudden friendship developed into neighborlyintimacy, and she and Flossy saw much of each other, dropping infamiliarly, and often walking and shopping together. The two men were onsufficiently cordial terms, each being tolerant of the other'slimitations, and seeking to recognize his good points for the sake ofthe bond between their wives. The return dinner was duly given, andSelma, hopeless of imitating the barbaric splendor, sought refuge in thereflection that the aesthetic and intellectual atmosphere of her tablewould atone for the lack of material magnificence, and limited herefforts to a few minor details such as providing candles with coloredshades and some bonbon dishes. It was plain that Flossy admired herbecause she recognized her to be a fine and superior soul, and theappreciation of this served to make it more easy not to repine at thedifference between their entertainments. Still the constant acquisitionof pretty things by her frank and engaging friend was an ordeal whichonly a soul endowed with high, stern democratic faith and purpose couldhope to endure with equanimity. Flossy bought new adornments for herhouse and her person with an amiable lavishness which required noconfession to demonstrate that her husband was making money. She madethe confession, though, from time to time with a bubbling pride, neversuspecting that it could harass or tempt her spiritual looking friend.She prattled artlessly of theatre parties followed by a supper at one ofthe fashionable restaurants, and of new acquaintances whom sheentertained, and through whom her social circle was enlarged, withoutdivining that the sprightly narration was a thorn in the flesh of herhearer. Selma was capricious in her reception of these reports ofprogress. At times she listened to them with grave, cold eyes, whichFlossy took for signals of noble disdain and sought to deprecate bywooing promises to be less worldly. At others she asked questions with afeverish, searching curiosity, which stimulated Mrs. Williams's free andindependent style into running commentaries on the current course ofsocial events and the doings and idiosyncracies of contemporary leadersof fashion whom she had viewed from afar. One afternoon Selma saw fromher window Flossy and her husband drive jubilantly away in a high cartwith yellow wheels drawn by a sleek cob, and at the same moment shebecame definitely aware that her draught from the cup of life had abitter taste. Why should these people drive in their own vehicle ratherthan she? It seemed clear to her that Wilbur could not be making thebest use of his talents, and that she had both a grievance against himand a sacred duty to perform in his and her own behalf. Justice andself-respect demanded that their mutual light should no longer be hidunder a bushel.CHAPTER V.Pauline Littleton was now established in her new lodgings. Having beenfreed by her brother's marriage from the responsibilities of ahousewife, she was able to concentrate her attention on the work inwhich she was interested. Her classes absorbed a large portion of hertime. The remainder was devoted to writing to girls in other cities whosought her advice in regard to courses of study, and to correspondence,consultation, and committee meetings with a group of women in New Yorkand elsewhere, who like herself were engrossed in educational matters.She was glad to have the additional time thus afforded her for pursuingher own tastes, and the days seemed too short for what she wished toaccomplish. She occupied two pleasant rooms within easy walking distanceof her brother's house. Her classes took her from home four days in theweek, and two mornings in every seven were spent at her desk with herbooks and papers, in the agreeable labor of planning and correspondence.Naturally one of her chief desires was to be on loving terms with herbrother's wife, and to do everything in her power to add to Selma'shappiness. She summoned her women friends to meet her sister-in-law atafternoon tea. All of these called on the bride, and some of theminvited her to their houses. They were busy women like Pauline herself,intent in their several ways on their vocations or avocations. They weredisposed to extend the right hand of fellowship to Mrs. Littleton, whomthey without exception regarded as interesting in appearance, but theyhad no leisure for immediate intimacy with her. Having been introducedto her and having scheduled her in their minds as a new and desirableacquaintance, they went their ways, trusting chiefly to time to renewthe meeting and to supply the evidence as to the stranger's socialvalue. Busy people in a large city are obliged to argue that new-comersshould win their spurs, and that great minds, valuable opinions, andmoving social graces are never crushed by inhumanity, but are certainsooner or later to gain recognition. Therefore after being very cordialand expressing the hope of seeing more of her in the future, every onedeparted and left Selma to her duties and her opportunities asLittleton's wife, without having the courtesy to indicate that theyconsidered her a superior woman.Pauline regarded this behavior on the part of her friends as normal, andhaving done her social duty in the afternoon tea line, without asuspicion that Selma was disappointed by the experience, she gaveherself up to the congenial undertaking of becoming intimate with hersister-in-law. She ascribed Selma's reserve, and cold, serious mannerpartly to shyness due to her new surroundings, and partly to thespiritual rigor of the puritan conscience and point of view. She hadoften been told that individuals of this temperament possessed moredepth of character than more emotional and socially facile people, andshe was prepared to woo. In comparison with Wilbur, Pauline wasaccustomed to regard herself as a practical and easy-going soul, but shewas essentially a woman of fine and vigorous moral and mental purpose.Like many of her associates in active life, however, she had become toooccupied with concrete possibilities to be able to give much thought toher own soul anatomy, and she was glad to look up to her brother's wifeas a spiritual superior and to recognize that the burden lay on herselfto demonstrate her own worthiness to be admitted to close intimacy onequal terms. Wilbur was to her a creature of light, and she had no doubtthat his wife was of the same ethereal composition.Pauline was glad, too, of the opportunity really to know a countrywomanof a type so different from her own friends. She, like Wilbur, had heardall her life of these interesting and inspiring beings; intense,marvellously capable, peerless, free-born creatures panoplied inchastity and endowed with congenital mental power and bodily charms, whowere able to cook, educate children, control society and writeliterature in the course of the day's employment. The newspapers andpopular opinion had given her to understand that these were the trueAmericans, and caused her to ask herself whether the circle to which sheherself belonged was not retrograde from a nobler ideal. In what way shedid not precisely understand, except that she and her friends did notaltogether disdain nice social usages and conventional womanly ways.But, nevertheless, the impression had remained in her mind that she mustbe at fault somehow, and it interested her that she would now be able tounderstand wherein she was inferior.She went to see Selma as often as she could, and encouraged her to callat her lodgings on the mornings when she was at home, expecting that itmight please her sister-in-law to become familiar with the buddingeducational enterprises, and that thus a fresh bond of sympathy would beestablished between them. Selma presented herself three or four times inthe course of the next three months, and on the first occasion expressedgratifying appreciation of the cosiness of the new lodgings."I almost envy you," she said, "your freedom to live your own life anddo just what you like. It must be delightful away up here where you cansee over the tops of the houses and almost touch the sky, and there isno one to disturb the current of your thoughts. It must be a gloriousplace to work and write. I shall ask you to let me come up heresometimes when I wish to be alone with my own ideas.""As often as you like. You shall have a pass key.""I should think," said Selma, continuing to gaze, with her far awaylook, over the vista of roofs which the top story of the apartment housecommanded, "that you would be a great deal happier than if you hadmarried him."The pause which ensued caused her to look round, and add jauntily, "Ihave heard, you know, about Dr. Page."A wave of crimson spread over Pauline's face--the crimson of woundedsurprise, which froze Selma's genial intentions to the core."I didn't think you'd mind talking about it," she said stiffly."There's nothing to talk about. Since you have mentioned it, Dr. Page isa dear friend of mine, and will always continue to be, I hope.""Oh, I knew you were nothing but friends now," Selma answered. She feltwounded in her turn. She had come with the wish to be gracious andcompanionable, and it had seemed to her a happy thought to congratulatePauline on the wisdom of her decision. She did not like people who werenot ready to be communicative and discuss their intimate concerns.The episode impaired the success of the first morning visit. At thenext, which occurred a fortnight later, Pauline announced that she had apiece of interesting news."Do you know a Mr. Joel Flagg in Benham?""I know who he is," said Selma. "I have met his daughter.""It seems he has made a fortune in oil and real estate, and is desirousto build a college for women in memory of his mother, Sarah Wetmore. Oneof my friends has just received a letter from a Mrs. Hallett Taylor, towhom Mr. Flagg appears to have applied for counsel, and who wishes someof us who are interested in educational matters to serve as an advisorycommittee. Probably you know Mrs. Taylor too?""Oh yes. I have been at her house, and I served with her on thecommittee which awarded Wilbur the church.""Why, then you are the very person to tell us all about her. I think Iremember now having heard Wilbur mention her name.""Wilbur fancied her, I believe.""Your tone rather implies that you did not. You must tell me everythingyou know. My friend has corresponded with her before in regard to someartistic matters, but she has never met her. Her letter suggests alady.""I dare say you would like Mrs. Taylor," said Selma, gravely. "She isattractive, I suppose, and seemed to know more or less about Europeanart and pictures, but we in Benham didn't consider her exactly anAmerican. If you really wish to know my opinion, I think that she wastoo exclusive a person to have fine ideas.""That's a pity.""If she lived in New York she would like to be one of those societyladies who live on Fifth Avenue; only she hasn't really any conceptionof what true elegance is. Her house there, except for the ornaments shehad bought abroad, was not so well furnished as the one I lived in. Iwonder what she would think if she could look into the drawing-room ofmy friend Mrs. Williams.""I see," said Pauline, though in truth she was puzzled. "I am sorry ifshe is a fine lady, but people like that, when they become interested,are often excellent workers. It is a noble gift of Mr. Flagg's--500,000as a foundation fund. He's a good American at all events. Wilbur mustcertainly compete for the buildings, and his having first met you thereought to be an inspiration to him to do fine work."Selma had been glad of the opportunity to criticise Mrs. Hallett Taylor,whom she had learned, by the light of her superior social knowledge, toregard as an unimportant person. Yet she had been conscious of arighteous impulse in saying what she thought of her. She knew that shehad never liked Mrs. Taylor, and she was not pleased to hear that Mr.Flagg had selected her from among the women of Benham to superintend theadministration of his splendid gift. Benham had come to seem to herremote and primitive, yet she preferred, and was in the mood, to thinkthat it represented the principles which were dear to her, and that shehad been appreciated there far better than in her present sphere. Shewas still tied to Benham by correspondence with Mrs. Earle. Selma hadwritten at once to explain her sudden departure, and letters passedbetween them at intervals of a few weeks--letters on Selma's part fluentwith dazzled metropolitan condescension, yet containing every now andthen a stern charge against her new fellow-citizens on the score oflevity and worldliness.The donation for the establishment of Wetmore College was made shortlyafter another institution for the education of women in which Paulinewas interested--Everdean College--had been opened to students. Thenumber of applicants for admission to Everdean had been larger than theauthorities had anticipated, and Pauline, who had been one of thepromoters and most active workers in raising funds for and supervisingthe construction of this labor of love, was jubilant over the outlook,and busy in regard to a variety of new matters presented for solution bythe suddenly evolved needs of the situation. Among these was theacquisition of two or three new women instructors; and it occurred toPauline at once that Selma might know of some desirable candidate. Selmaappeared to manifest but little interest in this inquiry at the time,but a few months subsequent to their conversation in regard to Mrs.Taylor she presented herself at Pauline's rooms one morning with theannouncement that she had found some one. Pauline, who was busy at herdesk, asked permission to finish a letter before listening; so there wassilence for a few minutes, and Selma, who wore a new costume of a morefashionable guise than her last, reflected while she waited that thedetails of such work as occupied her sister-in-law must be tedious.Indeed, she had begun to entertain of late a sort of contempt for thedeliberate, delving processes of the Littletons. She was inclined to askherself if Wilbur and Pauline were not both plodders. Her own idea ofdoing things was to do them quickly and brilliantly, arriving atconclusions, as became an American, with prompt energy and despatch. Itseemed to her that Wilbur, in his work, was slow and elaborate, disposedto hesitate and refine instead of producing boldly and immediately. Andhis sister, with her studies and letter-writing, suggested the samewearisome tendency. Why should not Wilbur, in his line, act with theconfident enterprise and capacity to produce immediate, ostensibleresults which their neighbor, Gregory Williams, displayed? As forPauline, of course she had not Wilbur's talent and could not, perhaps,be expected to shine conspicuously, but surely she might make more ofherself if only she would cease to spend so much time in details andcogitation, with nothing tangible to show for her labor. Selmaremembered her own experience as a small school teacher, and herthankfulness at her escape from a petty task unworthy of hercapabilities, and she smiled scornfully to herself, as she sat waiting,at what she regarded Pauline's willingness to spend her energies in suchinconspicuous, self-effacing work. Indeed, when Pauline had finished herletter and announced that she was now entirely at leisure, Selma feltimpelled to remark:"I should think, Pauline, that you would give a course of lectures oneducation. We should be glad to have them at our house, and your friendsought to be able to dispose of a great many tickets." Such a thing hadnever occurred to Selma until this moment, but it seemed to her, as sheheard her own words, a brilliant suggestion, both as a step forward forPauline and a social opportunity for herself."On education? My dear Selma, you have no idea of the depths of myignorance. Education is an enormous subject, and I am just beginning torealize how little I know concerning it. People have talked and writtenabout education enough. What we need and what some of us are trying todo is to study statistics and observe results. I am very much obliged toyou, but I should only make myself a laughing-stock.""I don't think you would. You have spent a great deal of time inlearning about education, and you must have interesting things to say.You are too modest and--don't you think it may be that you are not quiteenterprising enough? A course of lectures would call public attention toyou, and you would get ahead faster, perhaps. I think that you andWilbur are both inclined to hide your light under a bushel. It seems tome that one can be conscientious and live up to one's ideals withoutneglecting one's opportunities.""The difficulty is," said Pauline, with a laugh, "that I shouldn'tregard it as an opportunity, and I am sure it wouldn't help me to getahead, as you call it, with the people I desire to impress, to giveafternoon tea or women-club lectures. I don't know enough to lectureeffectively. As to enterprise, I am busy from morning until night. Whatmore can a woman do? You mustn't hurry Wilbur, Selma. All he needs istime to let the world see his light.""Very likely. Of course, if you don't consider that you know enoughthere is nothing to be said. I thought of it because I used to lecturein Benham, at the Benham Institute, and I am sure it helped me to getahead. I used to think a great deal about educational matters, andperhaps I will set you the example by giving some lectures myself.""That would be very interesting. If a person has new ideas and hasconfidence in them, it is natural to wish to let the world hear them."Pauline spoke amiably, but she was disposed to regard her sister withmore critical eyes. She felt no annoyance at the patronizing tone towardherself, but the reference to Wilbur made her blood rebel. Still shecould not bear to harbor distrust against that grave face with itsdelicate beauty and spiritualized air, which was becomingly accommodatedto metropolitan conditions by a more festive bonnet than any which sheherself owned. Yet she noticed that the thin lips had an expression ofdiscontent, and she wondered why.Recurring to the errand on which she had come, Selma explained that shehad just received a letter from Benham--from her friend, Mrs. MargaretRodney Earle, an authoress and a promulgator of advanced and originalideas in respect to the cause of womanhood, asking if she happened toknow of an opening for a gifted young lady in any branch of intellectualwork."I thought at once of Everdean," said Selma, "and have come to give youthe opportunity of securing her."Pauline expressed her thanks cordially, and inquired if Mrs. Earle hadreferred to the candidate's experience or special fitness for the dutiesof the position."She writes that she is very clever and gifted. I did not bring theletter with me, but I think Mrs. Earle's language was that Miss Baileywill perform brilliantly any duties which may be intrusted to her.""That is rather general," said Pauline. "I am sorry that she didn'tspecify what Miss Bailey's education has been, and whether she hastaught elsewhere.""Mrs. Earle wouldn't have recommended her if she hadn't felt sure thatshe was well educated. I remember seeing her at the Benham Institute onone of the last occasions when I was present. She delivered a whistlingsolo which every one thought clever and melodious.""I dare say she is just the person we are looking for," said Pauline,leniently. "It happens that Mrs. Grainger--my friend to whom Mrs. Taylorwrote concerning Mr. Flagg's gift--is to make Mrs. Taylor a visit atBenham next week, in order to consider the steps to be taken in regardto Wetmore College. She and Miss Bailey can arrange to meet, and thatwill save Miss Bailey the expense of a journey to New York, at thepossible risk of disappointment.""I thought," said Selma, "that you would consider yourselves fortunateto secure her services.""I dare say we shall be very fortunate, Selma. But we cannot engage herwithout seeing her and testing her qualifications."Selma made no further demur at the delay, but she was obviouslysurprised and piqued that her offer should be treated in this elaboratefashion. She was obliged to acknowledge to herself that she could notreasonably expect Pauline to make a definite decision without furtherinquiry, but she had expected to be able to report to Mrs. Earle thatthe matter was as good as settled--that, if Miss Bailey would give a fewparticulars as to her accomplishments, the position would be hers.Surely she and Mrs. Earle were qualified to choose a school-teacher.Here was another instance of the Littleton tendency to waste time onunimportant details. She reasoned that a woman with more wide-awakeperceptions would have recognized the opportunity as unusual, and wouldhave snapped up Miss Bailey on the spot.The sequel was more serious. Neither Selma nor Pauline spoke of thematter for a month. Then it was broached by Pauline, who wrote a fewlines to the effect that she was sorry to report that the authorities ofEverdean, after investigation, had concluded not to engage the servicesof Miss Bailey as instructor. When Selma read the note her cheeks burnedwith resentment. She regarded the decision as an affront. Pauline dinedwith them on the evening of that day, and at table Selma was cold andformal. When the two women were alone, Selma said at once, with anattempt at calmness:"What fault do you find with my candidate?""I think it possible that she might have been satisfactory from the merepoint of scholarship," judicially answered Pauline, who did not realizein the least that her sister-in-law was offended, "though Mrs. Graingerstopped short of close inquiry on that score, for the reason that MissBailey failed to satisfy our requirements in another respect. I don'twish to imply by what I am going to say anything against her character,or her capacity for usefulness as a teacher under certain conditions,but I confide to you frankly, Selma, that we make it an absolutecondition in the choice of instructors for our students that they shouldbe first of all lady-like in thought and speech, and here it was thatshe fell short. Of course I have never seen Miss Bailey, but Mrs.Grainger reported that she was--er--impossible.""You mean that your friend does not consider her a lady? She isn't asociety lady, but I did not suppose an American girl would be refused aposition as a teacher for such a reason as that.""A lady is a lady, whether she is what you term a society lady or not.Mrs. Grainger told us that Miss Bailey's appearance and manners did notsuggest the womanly refinement which we deem indispensable in those whoare to teach our college students. Five years ago only scholarship andcleverness were demanded, but experience has taught the educators ofwomen that this was a mistake.""I presume," said Selma, with dramatic scorn, "that Mrs. Hallett Taylordisapproved of her. I thought there would be some such outcome when Iheard that she was to be consulted.""Mrs. Taylor's name was not mentioned," answered Pauline, inastonishment. "I had no idea, Selma, that you regarded this as apersonal matter. You told me that you had seen Miss Bailey but once.""I am interested in her because--because I do not like to see a cruelwrong done. You do not understand her. You allow a prejudice, aclass-prejudice, to interfere with her career and the opportunity todisplay her abilities. You should have trusted Mrs. Earle, Pauline, Sheis my friend, and she recommended Miss Bailey because she believed inher. It is a reflection on me and my friends to intimate that she is nota lady."She bent forward from the sofa with her hands clasped and her lipstightly compressed. For a moment she gazed angrily at the bewilderedPauline, then, as though she had suddenly bethought her of her New Yorkmanner, she drew herself up and said with a forced laugh--"If the reasonyou give were not so ridiculous, I should be seriously offended.""Offended! Offended with Pauline," exclaimed Littleton, who entered theroom at the moment. "It cannot be that my two guardian angels have had afalling out." He looked from one to the other brightly as if it werereally a joke."It is nothing," said Selma."It seems," said Pauline with fervor, "that I have unintentionally hurtSelma's feelings. It is the last thing in the world I wish to do, and Itrust that when she thinks the matter over she will realize that I aminnocent. I am very, very sorry."CHAPTER VI."Why don't you follow the advice of Mr. Williams and buy some shares ofstock?" asked Selma lightly, yet coaxingly, of her husband one day inthe third year of their marriage. The Williamses were dining with themat the time, and a statement by Gregory, not altogether without motive,as to the profits made by several people who had taken his advice,called forth the question. He and his wife were amiably inclined towardthe Littletons, and were proud of the acquaintance. Among their otherfriends they boasted of the delightful excursions into the literarycircle which the intimacy afforded them. They both would have beenpleased to see their neighbors more amply provided with money, andGregory, partly at the instance of Flossy, partly from sheer good-humorin order to give a deserving but impractical fellow a chance to betterhimself, threw out tips from time to time--crumbs from the rich man'stable, but bestowed in a friendly spirit. Whenever they were let fall,Selma would look at Wilbur hoping for a sign of interest, but hithertothey had evoked merely a smile of refusal or had been utterly ignored.Her own question had been put on several occasions, both in the companyof the tempter and in the privacy of the domestic hearth, and both inthe gayly suggestive and the pensively argumentative key. Why might theynot, by means of a clever purchase in the stock market, occasionallyprocure some of the agreeable extra pleasures of life--provide the readymoney for theatres, a larger wardrobe, trips from home, or a modestequipage? Why not take advantage of the friendly advice given? Mr.Williams had made clear that the purchase of stocks on a sufficientmargin was no more reprehensible as a moral proposition than thepurchase of cargoes of sugar, cotton, coffee or tea against whichmerchants borrowed money at the bank. In neither instance did thepurchaser own outright what he sought to sell at an advance; merely inone case it was shares, in the other merchandise. Of course it wasfoolish for inexperienced country folk with small means to dabble instocks and bonds, but why should not city people who were clever and hadclever friends in the business eke out the cost of living by shrewdinvestments? In an old-fashioned sense it might be considered gambling;but, if it were true, as Wilbur and Mr. Williams both maintained, thatthe American people were addicted to speculation, was not the existenceof the habit strong evidence that the prejudice against it must beill-founded? The logical and the patriotic conclusion must needs be thatbusiness methods had changed, and that the American nation had beenclever enough to substitute dealings in shares of stock, and incontracts relating to cereals and merchandise for the methods of theirgrandfathers who delivered the properties in bulk.To this condensation of Gregory's glib sophistries on the lips of hiswife, Wilbur had seemed to turn a deaf ear. It did not occur to him, atfirst, that Selma was seriously in earnest. He regarded her suggestionsof neglected opportunities, which were often whimsically uttered, asmore than half playful--a sort of make-believe envy of the meteoricprogress in magnificence of their friendly neighbors. He was even gladthat she should show herself appreciative of the merits of civilizedcomfort, for he had been afraid lest her ascetic scruples would lead herjudgments too far in the opposite direction. He welcomed them andencouraged her small schemes to make the establishment more festive andstylish in appearance, in modest imitation of the splendor next door.But constant and more sombre reference to the growing fortunes of theWilliamses presently attracted his attention and made him moreobservant. His income sufficed to pay the ordinary expenses of quietdomestic life, and to leave a small margin for carefully, consideredamusements, but he reflected that if Selma were yearning for greaterluxury, he could not afford at present to increase materially herallowance. It grieved him as a proud man to think that the woman heloved should lack any thing she desired, and without a thought ofdistrust he applied himself more strenuously to his work, hoping thatthe sum of his commissions would enable him presently to gratify some ofher hankerings--such, for instance, as the possession of a horse andvehicle. Selma had several times alluded with a sigh to the satisfactionthere must be in driving in the new park. Babcock had kept a horse, andthe Williamses now drove past the windows daily in a phaeton drawn bytwo iron gray, champing steeds. He said to himself that he couldscarcely blame Selma if she coveted now and then Flossy's finepossessions, and the thought that she was not altogether happy inconsequence of his failure to earn more kept recurring to his mind andworried him. No children had been born to them, and he pictured withgrowing concern his wife lonely at home on this account, yet withoutextra income to make purchases which might enable her to forget at timesthat there was no baby in the house. Flossy had two children, a boy anda girl, two gorgeously bedizened little beings who were trundled alongthe sidewalk in a black, highly varnished baby-wagon which was reputedby the dealer who sold it to Gregory to have belonged to an Englishnobleman. Wilbur more than once detected Selma looking at the babieswith a wistful glance. She was really admiring their clothes, yet thethought of how prettily she would have been able to dress a baby of herown was at times so pathetic as to bring tears to her eyes, and causeher to deplore her own lack of children as a misfortune.As the weeks slipped away and Wilbur realized that, though he wasgaining ground in his profession, more liberal expenditures were stillout of the question, he reached a frame of mind which made him yearn fora means of relief. So it happened that, when Selma asked him once morewhy he did not follow the advice proffered and buy some stocks, hereplied by smiling at Gregory and inquiring what he should buy. Duringthe dinner, which had been pleasant, Wilbur's eye had been attracted bythe brilliancy of some new jewels which Mrs. Williams wore, and he hadbeen conscious of the wish that he were able to make a present like thatto his own wife."You take my breath away. Wonders will never cease," responded Gregory,while both the women clapped their hands. "But you musn't buy anything;you must sell," he continued. "VanHorne and I both came to theconclusion to-day that it is time for a turn on the short side of themarket. When the public are crazy and will buy any thing, then is thetime to let them have all they wish.""What, then, am I to sell?" asked Wilbur "I am a complete lamb, youknow." He was already sorry that he had consented, but Selma's manifestinterest restrained him from turning the matter into a joke."Leave it all to me," said Williams with a magnificent gesture."But you will need some money from me.""Not at all. If you would feel better, you may send me a check or a bondfor a thousand dollars. But it isn't necessary in your case.""I will bring you in a bond to-morrow--one of the very few I own."Wilbur having delivered his security the first thing in the morning,heard nothing further from Williams for a fortnight. One day he receiveda formal account of certain transactions executed by Williams andVanHorne for Wilbur Littleton, Esq., and a check for two thousanddollars. The flush which rose to his cheeks was induced partly bypleasure, partly by shame. His inclination, as he reflected, was toreturn the check, but he recognized presently that this was a foolishidea, and that the only thing to be done was to deposit it. He wrote agrateful note of acknowledgment to Williams, and then gave himself up tothe agreeable occupation of thinking what he should buy for Selma withthe money. He decided not to tell her of his good fortune, but to treather to a surprise. His first fancy was in favor of jewelry--somenecklace or lustrous ornament for the hair, which would charm thefeminine eye and might make Selma even more beautiful than she alreadyappeared in evening dress. His choice settled on a horse and buggy asmore genuinely useful. To be sure there was the feed of the animal to beconsidered; but he would be able to reserve sufficient money to coverthis cost for some months, and by the end of that time he would perhapsbe able to afford the outlay from his income. Horse-flesh and vehicleswere not in his line, but he succeeded by investigation in procuring amodest equipment for seven hundred dollars, which left him three hundredfor fodder, and the other thousand. This he had decided to hand over toSelma as pin money. It was for her sake that he had consented tospeculate, and it seemed meet that she should have the satisfaction ofspending it.He carried out his surprise by appearing one afternoon before the doorand inviting her to drive. Selma became radiant at the news that thehorse and buggy were hers, though, when the particulars of the purchasewere disclosed she said to herself that she wished Wilbur had allowedher to choose the vehicle. She would have preferred one more stylish andless domestic looking. She flung her arms about his neck and gave him akiss on their return to show her satisfaction."You see how easy it is, Wilbur," she said as she surveyed the checkwhich he had handed her."It was not I, it was Williams.""No, but you could, if you would only think so. I have the greatestconfidence in you, dear," she added, looking eagerly into his face; "butdon't you sometimes go out of your way to avoid what is enterprisingand--er--modern, just because it is modern?""Gambling is as old as the hills, Selma.""Yes. And if this were gambling--the sort of gambling you mean, do youthink I would allow you to do it? Do you think the American people wouldtolerate it for a minute?" she asked triumphantly."It seems to me that your admiration for the American people sometimesmakes you a little weak in your logic," he answered with good-humor. Hewas so pleased by Selma's gratification that he was disposed to exorcisehis scruples."I have always told you that I was more of a patriot than you, Wilbur."The bond had not been returned by Williams at the time he sent themoney, and some fortnight later--only a few days in fact after thisdrive, Littleton received another cheque for 500 and a request that hecall at the office."I thought you would like to see the instruments of torture at work--theprocess of lamb-shearing in active operation," Williams explained as heshook hands and waved him into his private room. After a few easyremarks on the methods of doing business the broker continued, "Iflatter myself that for so small an investment and so short a time, Ihave done tolerably well for you.""I scarcely know how to express my thanks and my admiration for yourskill. Indeed I feel rather awkwardly about--""That's all right, my dear fellow. It's my business; I get mycommission. Still I admit friendly regard--and this is why I suggestedyour dropping in--by introducing the personal equation, makes onenervous. If instead of closing out your account, I had in each instanceheld on, you would have made more money. I was glad to take thisresponsibility at first because you were a neophyte at the business, butI think it will be more satisfactory both for you and for me that infuture transactions you should give me the word when to reap the profit.Of course you shall have all the information which I possess and myadvice will be at your command, but where a man's money is concerned hisown head is apt to be the wisest counsellor. Now I took the libertyyesterday of selling for you two hundred shares of Reading railroad. Youcan cover to-day at a profit of one point--about 200. I do not urge it.On the contrary I believe that the market, barring occasional rallies,is still on the downward track. I wish, however, to put you in aposition where you can, if you desire, take advantage of the fullopportunities of the financial situation and save myself from feelingthat I have robbed you by my friendly caution.""In other words you don't wish to speculate with my money," saidLittleton. "You wish me to paddle my own canoe."Williams' real desire was to escape the bother of personallysuperintending an insignificant account. His circumlocution was a suaveway of stating that he had done all that could be expected of a neighborand benevolent friend, and that the ordinary relation of broker andcustomer ought now be established. As for Littleton, he perceived thathe was not free to retire from the market on the profits of friendlyregard unless he was prepared to fly in the face of advice and buy inhis two hundred Reading railroad. To do so would be pusillanimous;moreover to retire and abstain from further dealings would makeWilliams' two cheques more obviously a charitable donation, and thethought of them was becoming galling. Above all there were Selma'sfeelings to be considered. The possession of the means to afford herhappiness was already a sweet argument in favor of further experiments.And so it happened that during the next nine months Littleton became afrequenter of the office of Williams & VanHorne. He was not among thosewho hung over the tape and were to be seen there daily; but he foundhimself attracted as the needle by the magnet to look in once or twice aweek to ascertain the state of the market. His ventures continued to besmall, and were conducted under the ken of Williams, and though theoccasional rallies referred to by the broker harassed Wilbur's spiritwhen they occurred, the policy of selling short proved reasonablyremunerative in the course of half a dozen separate speculations. Inround figures he added another 2,500 to that which Williams had madefor him. The process kept him on pins and needles, and led him to scanthe list of stock quotations before reading anything else in thenewspaper. Selma was delighted at his success, and though he chose notto tell her the details of his dealings, she watched him furtively,followed the general tendency of the market, and when she perceived thathe was in good spirits, satisfied sufficiently her curiosity byquestions.On the strength of this addition to their pecuniary resources, Selmabranched out into sundry mild extravagances. She augmented her wardrobe,engaged an additional house-maid and a more expensive cook, andentertained with greater freedom and elaboration. She was fond of goingto the theatre and supping afterward at some fashionable restaurantwhere she could show her new plumage and be a part of the gay,chattering rout at the tables consuming soft-shelled crabs andchampagne. She was gradually increasing her acquaintance, chiefly amongthe friends of the Williamses, people who were fond of display andluxury and who seemed to have plenty of money. In this connection shewas glad to avail herself of the reputation of belonging to the literarycircle, and she conceived the plan of mingling these new associates withWilbur's former set--to her thinking a delightful scheme, which sheinaugurated by means of a dinner party. She included among the guestsPauline and Dr. Page, and considered that she had acted gracefully inputting them side by side at table, thus sacrificing the theory of herentertainment to her feminine interest in romance. In her opinion it wasmore than Pauline deserved, and she was proud of her generosity. Therewere fourteen in the company, and after dinner they were regaled by ayoung woman who had brought a letter of introduction to Selma from Mrs.Earle, who read from her own poems. The dinner was given for her, andher seat was between Wilbur and Mr. Dennison, the magazine editor. Selmahad attended a dinner-party at the Williamses a fortnight earlier wherethere had been music in the drawing-room by a ballad-singer at a cost of100 (so Flossy had told her in confidence). A poetess reading from herown works, a guest and not invited in after dinner on a businessfooting, appealed to Selma as more American, and less expensive. She, inher secret soul, would have liked to recite herself, but she feared torun the gauntlet of the New York manner. The verses were intense incharacter and were delivered by the young woman with a hollow-eyedfervor which, as one of the non-literary wing of the company stated,made one creep and weep alternately. There was no doubt that theentertainment was novel and acceptable to the commercial element, and toSelma it seemed a delightful reminder of the Benham Institute. She wascurious to know what Mr. Dennison thought, though she said to herselfthat she did not really care. She felt that anything free and earnest inthe literary line was likely to be frowned on by the coterie to whichher husband's people belonged. Nevertheless she seized an opportunity toask the editor if he did not think the verses remarkable."They are certainly remarkable," answered Mr. Dennison. After a briefpause he added, "Being a strictly truthful person, Mrs. Littleton, I donot wish to seek shelter behind the rampart which your word 'remarkable'affords. A dinner may be remarkable--remarkably good, like the one Ihave just eaten, or remarkably bad. Some editors would have replied toyou as I have done, and yet been capable of a mental reservationunflattering to the ambitious young woman to whom we have beenlistening. But without wishing to express an opinion, let me remind youthat poetry, like point-lace, needs close scrutiny before its merits canbe defined. I thought I recognized some ancient and well-worn flowers ofspeech, but my editorial ear and eye may have been deceived. She hasbeautiful hair at all events."     "'Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare;      And beauty draws us by a single hair.'"You cynical personage! I only hope she may prove a genius and that youwill realize when too late that you might have discovered her," saidSelma, looking into his face brightly with a knowing smile and tappingher fan against her hand. She was in a gay humor at the success of theentertainment, despite the non-committal attitude of this censor, andpleased at the appositeness of her quotation. Her figure had filled outsince her marriage. She was almost plump and she wore a single short fatcurl pendent behind her ear.A few months subsequent to this dinner party Flossy announced one daythat Mr. Silas S. Parsons, whom Selma had seen with the Williamses atthe theatre nearly three years before, had come to live in New York withhis wife and daughter. Flossy referred to him eagerly as one of herhusband's most valuable customers, a shrewd, sensible, Western businessman, who had made money in patent machinery and was superbly rich. Hehad gone temporarily to a hotel, but he was intending to build a largehouse on Fifth Avenue near the park. Selma heard this announcement withkeen interest, asking herself at once why Wilbur should not be thearchitect. Why not, indeed? She promptly reasoned that here was herchance to aid her husband; that he, if left to his own devices, would donothing to attract the magnate's attention, and that it behooved her, asan American wife and a wide-awake, modern woman, to let Mr. Parsons knowhis qualifications, and to prepossess him in Wilbur's favor by her ownattractions. The idea appealed to her exceedingly. She had been hopingthat some opportunity to take an active part in the furtherance ofWilbur's career would present itself, for she felt instinctively thatwith her co-operation he would make more rapid progress. Here wasexactly the occasion longed for. She saw in her mind's eye Mr. Parsons'scompleted mansion, stately and beautiful, the admired precursor of ahost of important edifices--a revolutionizing monument in contemporaryarchitecture. Wilbur would become the fashion, and his professionalsuccess be assured, thanks to the prompt ability of his wife to takeadvantage of circumstances. So she would prove herself a veritablehelpmate, and the bond of marital sympathy would be strengthened andrefreshed.To begin with, Selma hinted to Mrs. Williams that Mr. Parsons might doworse than employ Wilbur to design his house. Flossy accepted thesuggestion with enthusiasm and promised her support, adding that Mr.Parsons was a person of sudden and strong fancies, and that if he wereto take a fancy to Wilbur, the desired result would be apt to follow.Selma quickly decided that Mr. Parsons must be made to like her, for shefeared lest Wilbur's quiet, undemonstrative manner would fail to attracthim. Evidently he admired the self-confidence and manly assertion ofGregory Williams, and would be liable to regard Wilbur as lacking inforce and enterprise. The reflection that she would thus be working--asnecessarily she would--for the eternal progress of truth, added apleasant savor to the undertaking, for it was clear that her husband wasan ideal architect for the purpose, and she would be doing a trueservice to Mr. Parsons in convincing him that this was so. Altogetherher soul was in an agreeable flutter, notwithstanding that her neighborFlossy had recently received invitations to two or three large balls,and been referred to in the society columns of the newspapers as thefascinating and clever wife of the rising banker Gregory Williams.The Littletons were promptly given by Flossy the opportunity to make theacquaintance of the Parsons family. Mr. Parsons was a ponderous man ofover sixty, with a solid, rotund, grave face and a chin whisker. He wasabsorbed in financial interests, though he had retired from activebusiness, and had come to New York to live chiefly to please his wifeand daughter. Mrs. Parsons, who was somewhat her husband's junior, was adevotee, or more correctly, a debauchee, of hotel life. Since the timewhen they had become exceedingly rich, about ten years before, they hadmade a grand tour of the hotels of this country and Europe. By so doingMrs. Parsons and her daughter felt that they became a part of the sociallife of the cities which they visited. Although they had been used toplain, if not slovenly, house-keeping before the money came, both thewife and daughter had evolved into connoisseurs of modish and luxurioushotel apparatus and garniture. They had learned to revel in manycourses, radiantly upholstered parlors, and a close acquaintance withthe hotel register. Society for them, wherever they went, meant findingout the names of the other guests and dressing for them, being on easyterms with the head waiter and elevator boy, visiting the theatres, andkeeping up a round of shopping in pursuit of articles of apparel. Theywore rich garments and considerable jewelry, and plasteredthemselves--especially the daughter--with bunches of violets or rosesself-bestowed. Mrs. Parsons was partial to perfume, and they both wereaddicted to the free consumption of assorted bonbons. To be sure theyhad made some acquaintances in the course of their peregrinations, butone reason for moving to New York was that Mrs. Parsons had come to themelancholy conclusion that neither the princes of Europe nor the sons ofAmerican leading citizens were paying that attention to her daughterwhich the young lady's charms seemed to her to merit. If living lavishlyin hotels and seeing everybody right and left were not the high-road toelegant existence and hence to a brilliant match for Lucretia, Mrs.Parsons was ready to try the effect of a house on Fifth Avenue, thoughshe preferred the comforts of her present mode of life. Still oneadvantage of a stable home would be that Mr. Parsons could be constantlywith them, instead of an occasional and intermittent visitorcommunicated with more frequently by electricity than by word of mouth.While Mr. Parsons was selecting the land, she and Lucretia had abandonedthemselves to an orgy of shopping, and with an eye to the new house,their rooms at the hotel were already littered with gorgeous fabrics,patterns of wall-paper and pieces of pottery.Selma's facility in the New York manner was practised on Silas Parsonswith flattering success. He was captivated by her--more so than byFlossy, who amused him as a flibbertigibbet, but who seemed to him tolack the serious cast of character which he felt that he discernedbeneath the sprightliness of this new charmer. Mr. Parsons was what hecalled a "stickler" for the dignity of a serious demeanor. He liked tolaugh at the theatre, but mistrusted a daily point of view which savoredof buffoonery. He was fond of saying that more than one public man inthe United States had come to grief politically from being a joker, andthat the American people could not endure flippancy in theirrepresentatives. He liked to tell and listen to humorous stories in thesecurity of a smoking-room, but in his opinion it behooved a citizen tomaintain a dignified bearing before the world. Like other self-made menwho had come to New York--like Selma herself--he had shrunk from anddeplored at first the lighter tone of casual speech. Still he had grownused to it, and had even come to depend on it as an amusement. But hefelt that in the case of Selma there was a basis of ethical earnestness,appropriate to woman, beneath her chatty flow of small talk. That shewas comparatively a new-comer accounted partially for this impression,but it was mainly due to the fact that she still reverted after hersallies of pleasantry to a grave method of deportment.Selma's chief hospitality toward the Parsonses took the form of atheatre party, which included a supper at Delmonico's after the play. Itwas an expensive kind of entertainment, which she felt obliged tojustify to Wilbur by the assertion that the Williamses had been so civilshe considered it would be only decent to show attention to theirfriends. She was unwilling to disclose her secret, lest the knowledge ofit might make Wilbur offish and so embarrass her efforts. There wereeight in the party, and the affair seemed to Selma to go off admirably.She was enthralled by the idea of using her own personal magnetism topromote her husband's business. She felt that it was just the sort ofthing she would like and was fitted for, and that here was anopportunity for her individuality to display itself. She devoted herselfwith engaging assiduity to Mr. Parsons, pleased during the activeprocess of propitiation by the sub-consciousness that her table was oneof the centres of interest in the large restaurant. She had dressedherself with formal care, and nothing in the way of compliment couldhave gratified her more than the remark which Mr. Parsons made, as heregarded her appreciatively, when he had finished his supper, that shesuggested his idea of Columbia. Selma glowed with satisfaction. Thecomparison struck her as apt and appropriate, and she replied with aproud erection of her head, which imparted to her features theirtranscendental look, and caused her short curl to joggle tremulously, "Isuppose I see what you mean, Mr. Parsons."CHAPTER VII.One evening, four or five days after this supper party, Wilbur laid downthe book which he was pretending to read, and said, "Selma, I have cometo the conclusion that I must give up dabbling in stocks. I am beinginjured by it--not financially, for, as you know, I have made a fewthousand dollars--but morally.""I thought you were convinced that it was not immoral," answered Selma,in a constrained voice."I do not refer to whether speculation is justifiable in itself, but toits effect on me as an individual--its distraction to my mind andconsequent interference with my professional work.""Oh.""For a year now, the greater portion of the time, I have had someinterest in the market, and as a consequence, have felt impelled to lookin on Williams and VanHorne every day--sometimes oftener. I am unable todismiss my speculations from my thoughts. I find myself wondering whathas happened to the stocks I am carrying, and I am satisfied that thepractice is thoroughly demoralizing to my self-respect and to myprogress. I am going to give it up.""I suppose you must give it up if it affects you like that," respondedSelma drily. "I don't see exactly why it should.""It may seem foolish to you, but I am unable to put my ventures out ofmy mind. The consequences of loss would be so serious to me that Isuppose my imagination becomes unduly active and apprehensive. Also, Ifind myself eager to secure large gains. I must renounce Aladdin's lampfrom this day forth, my dear, and trust to my legitimate business for myincome."Selma folded her hands and looked grave. "It's disappointing that youfeel so just when we are beginning to get on, Wilbur.""I have realized, Selma, that you have enjoyed and--er--been madehappier by the freedom to spend which this extra money has afforded you.But I know, when you reflect, you will understand that I am right, andthat it would be disastrous to both of us if I were to continue to dowhat I believe demoralizing. It is a mortification to me to ask you toretrench, but I said to myself that Selma would be the first to insiston our doing so if she knew my feelings, and it makes me happy to besure of your approval."Littleton spoke with a tender plaintiveness which betrayed that in hissecret soul he was less confident on this score than his words declared,or than he himself supposed. "Of course," he added, earnestly, "I shallhope that it will not make much difference. My business is slowly, butsteadily, improving, and I am doing more this year than last. I ambending all my energies on my plans for Wetmore College. If I win inthat competition, I shall make a reputation and a respectablecommission.""You have been on those plans three months.""Yes, and shall not finish them for another two. I wish to do my bestwork, and I shall be glad not to hear quotations of the ticker in mybrain. You desire me to be thorough, surely, Selma _mia_?""Oh, yes. Only, you know people very often spoil things by potteringover them.""I never potter. I reject because I am dissatisfied rather than offer adesign which does not please me, but I do not waste my time.""Call it over-conscientiousness then. I wish you to do your best work,of course, but one can't expect to do best work invariably. Everythingwas going so nicely that you must perceive it will be inconvenient tohave to economize as we did before."Littleton looked at his wife with a glance of loving distress. "Youwouldn't really care a button. I know you wouldn't, Selma," he said,stoutly."Of course not, if it were necessary," she answered. "Only I don't wishto do so unless it is necessary. I am not controverting your decisionabout the stocks, though I think your imagination, as you say, is toblame. I would rather cut my right hand off than persuade you to actcontrary to your conscience. But it _is_ inconvenient, Wilbur, you mustadmit, to give up the things we have become accustomed to.""We shall be able to keep the horse. I am certain of that.""I wish you to see my side of it. Say that you do," she said, withshrill intensity."It is because I do see it that I am troubled, Selma. For myself I am nohappier now than I was when we lived more simply. I can't believe thatyou will really find it a hardship to deny yourself such extravagancesas our theatre party last week. Being a man," he added, after a pause,"I suppose I may not appreciate how important and seductive some ofthese social observances appear to a woman, and heaven knows my chiefwish in life is to do everything in my power to make you happy. You mustbe aware of that, dearest. I delight to work hard for your sake. But itseems almost ludicrous to be talking of social interests to you, of allwomen. Why, at the time we were married, I feared that you would cutyourself off from reasonable pleasures on account of your dislike ofeverything frivolous. I remember I encouraged you not to take tooascetic a view of such things. So I am bound to believe that your sideis my side--that we both will find true happiness in not attempting tocompete with people whose tastes are not our tastes, and whose aims arenot our aims.""Then you think I have deteriorated," she said, with a superior smile."I think of you as the most conscientious woman I ever met. It was onlynatural that you should be spurred by our neighbors, the Williamses, tomake a better showing socially before the world. I have been glad to seeyou emulous up to a certain point. You must realize though, that wecannot keep pace with them, even if we so desire. Already they are inthe public eye. He appears to have made considerable money, and hisviews on the stock-market are given prominence by the press. He and hiswife are beginning to be recognized by people who were ignorant of theirexistence four years ago. You told me last week that Mrs. Williams hadattended one of the fashionable balls, and I saw in yesterday'snewspaper a description of her toilette at another. It begins to look asif, in a few years more, their ambition might be realized, and the doorsof the Morton Price mansion open wide to admit this clever countrycousin to the earthly paradise. It must be evident to you, Selma, thatvery shortly we shall see only the dust of their chariot-wheels in thedim social distance. Williams told me to-day that he has bought a housenear the park.""He has bought a new house? They are going to move?" exclaimed Selma,sitting up straight, and with a fierce light in her eyes."Yes. He was going home to tell his wife. It seems that they have beentalking vaguely of moving for some time. An acquaintance happened tooffer him a house, and Williams closed the bargain on the spot in hiscustomary chain-lightning style. I shall be sorry to have them go onsome accounts, for they have always been friendly, and you seem fond ofthe wife, but we shall find it easier, perhaps, when they are gone, tolive according to our own ideas.""Flossy has not been quite so nice lately," said Selma; "I am afraid sheis disposed to put on airs.""Her head may have been turned by her success. She has a kind heart, buta giddy brain in spite of its cleverness.""Flossy has been getting on, of course. But so are we getting on. Whyshould they be recognized, as you call it, any more than we? In time, Imean. Not in the same way, perhaps, since you don't approve of the sortof things--""Since I don't approve? Why, Selma, surely--""Since _we_ don't approve, then. I only mean that Gregory Williams hasshown initiative, has pushed ahead, and is--er--the talk of the town. Iexpect you to be successful, too. Is there any reason on earth why thedoor of the Morton Prices should open wide to her and not to me?""I suppose not, if--if you wish it."She made a gesture of impatience and gazed at him a moment with animperious frown, then suddenly, with the litheness of a cat, she slippedfrom her chair to the floor at his feet, and leaning against his knee,looked up into his face."You dear boy, I am going to tell you something. You said to me oncethat if ever the time came when I thought you visionary, I was to letyou know. Of course I understand you are worth a thousand _Gregorys_;but don't you think you would get on faster if you were a little moreaggressive in your work?--if you weren't so afraid of being superficialor sensational? You were intimating a few minutes ago," she added,speaking rapidly under the stress of the message she burned to deliver,"that I seemed changed. I don't believe I am changed. But, if I seemdifferent, it is because I feel so strongly that those who wish tosucceed must assert themselves and seize opportunities. There is whereit seems to me that Mr. Williams has the advantage over you, Wilbur. Oneof the finest and most significant qualities of our people, you know, istheir enterprise and aggressiveness. Architecture isn't like the stockbusiness, but the same theory of progress must be applicable to both.Don't you think I may be right, Wilbur? Don't you see what I mean?"He stroked her hair and answered gently, "What is it that I am not doingwhich you think I might do?"Selma snuggled close to him, and put her hand in his. She was vibratingwith the proud consciousness of the duty vouchsafed to her to guide andassist the man she loved. It was a blissful and a precious moment toher. "If I were you," she said, solemnly, "I should build somethingstriking and original, something which would make everyone who beheld itask, 'what is the architect's name?' I would strike out boldly withoutcaring too much what the critics and the people of Europe would say. Youmusn't be too afraid, Wilbur, of producing something American, and youmustn't be too afraid of the American ways of doing things. We work morequickly here in everything, and--and I still can't help feeling that youpotter a little. Necessarily I don't know about the details of yourbusiness, but if I were you, instead of designing small buildings orcompeting for colleges and churches, where more than half the timesomeone else gets the award, I should make friends with the people wholive in those fine houses on Fifth Avenue, and get an order to design asplendid residence for one of them. If you were to make a grand successof that, as you surely would, your reputation would be made. You ask mewhy I like to entertain and am willing to know people like that. It isto help you to get clients and to come to the front professionally. Nowisn't that sensible and practical and right, too?"Her voice rang triumphantly with the righteousness of her plea."Selma, dear, if I am not worldly-wise enough, I am glad to listen toyour suggestions. But art is not to be hurried. I cannot vulgarize myart. I could not consent to that.""Of course not, Wilbur. Not worldly-wise enough is just the phrase, Ithink. You are so absorbed in the theory of fine things that I am sureyou often let the practical opportunities to get the fine things to doslip.""Perhaps, dear. I will try to guard against it." Wilbur took her handsin his and looked down tenderly into her face. His own was a littleweary. "Above everything else in life I wish, to make you happy," hesaid."I am happy, you dear boy.""Truly?""Yes, truly. And if something happens which I am nearly sure willhappen, I shall be happier still. It's a secret, and I mustn't tell you,but if it does happen, you can't help agreeing that your wife has beenclever and has helped you in your profession.""Helped me? Ah, Selma," he said, folding her in his arms, "I don't thinkyou realize how much you are to me. In this modern world, what withself-consciousness, and shyness and contemporary distaste for fulsomeexpression, it is difficult to tell adequately those we love how we feeltoward them. You are my darling and my inspiration. The sun rises andsets with you, and unless you were happy, I could never be. Each man inthis puzzling world must live according to his own lights, and I,according to mine, am trying to make the most of myself, consistent withself-respect and avoidance of the low human aims and time-servingmethods upon which our new civilization is supposed to frown. If I amneglecting my lawful opportunities, if I am failing to see wisely andcorrectly, I shall be grateful for counsel. Ah, Selma, for your sake,even more than for my own, I grieve that we have no children. A baby'shands would, I fancy, be the best of counsellors and enlighteners.""If children had come at first, it would have been very nice. Butnow--now I think they might stand in the way of my being of help to you.And I am so anxious to help you, Wilbur."As a result of this conversation Littleton devoted himself moreassiduously than ever to his work. He was eager to increase his earningsso that his income should not be curtailed by his decision to avoidfurther ventures in the stock-market. He was troubled in soul, forSelma's accusation that he was visionary haunted him. Could it be thathe was too scrupulous, too uncompromising, and lacked proper enterprise?Self-scrutiny failed to convince him that this was so, yet left alurking doubt which was harassing. His clear mind was too modest tobelieve in its own infallibility, for he was psychologist enough tounderstand that no one can be absolutely sure that his perspective oflife is accurate. Possibly he was sacrificing his wife's legitimateaspirations to too rigid canons of behavior, and to an unconscious lackof initiative. On the other hand, as a positive character, he believedthat he saw clearly, and he could not avoid the reflection that, if thiswas the case, he and Selma were drifting apart--the more bitteralternative of the two, and a condition which, if perpetuated, wouldinvolve the destruction of the scheme of matrimonial happiness, theideal communion of two sympathetic souls, in which he was living as aproud partner. Apparently he was in one of two predicaments; either hewas self deceived, which was abhorrent to him as a thoughtful grapplerwith the eternal mysteries, or he had misinterpreted the character ofthe woman whose transcendent quality was a dearer faith to him than theintegrity of his own manhood.So it was with a troubled heart that he applied himself to more rigorousprofessional endeavor. Like most architects he had pursued certain linesof work because orders had come to him, and the chances of employmenthad ordained that his services should be sought for small churches,school-houses and kindred buildings in the surrounding country ratherthan for more elaborate and costly structures. On these undertakings itwas his habit to expend abundant thought and devotion. The class of workwas to his taste, for, though the funds at his disposal were not alwaysso large as he desired for artistic effects, yet he enjoyed theopportunity of showing that simplicity need not be homely anddisenchanting, but could wear the aspect of grace and poetry. Latterlyhe had been requested to furnish designs for some blocks of houses inthe outlying wards of the city, where the owners sought to provideattractive, modern flats for people with moderate means. Variouscommissions had come to him, also, to design decorative work, whichinterested him and gave scope to his refined and aspiring imagination,and he was enthusiastically absorbed in preparing his competitive plansfor the building of Wetmore College. His time was already well occupiedby the matters which he had in hand. That is, he had enough to do andyet did not feel obliged to deny himself the luxury of deliberatethoroughness in connection with each professional undertaking. Save forthe thought that he must needs earn more in order to please Selma, hewould have been completely happy in the slow but flattering growth ofhis business, and in feeling his way securely toward greater success.Now, however, he began to ask himself if it were not possible to hastenthis or that piece of work in order to afford himself the necessaryleisure for new employment. He began also to consider whether he mightnot be able, without loss of dignity, to put himself in the way ofsecuring more important clients. To solicit business was not to bethought of, but now and again he put the question to himself whether hehad not been too indifferent as to who was who, and what was what, inthe development of his business.While Littleton was thus mulling over existing conditions, andsubjecting his conduct to the relentless lens of his own conscience andtheories, Selma announced to him jubilantly, about a fortnightsubsequent to their conversation, that her secret was a secret nolonger, and that Mr. Parsons desired to employ him to build an imposingprivate residence on Fifth Avenue near the Park. Mr. Parsons confirmedthis intelligence on the following day in a personal interview. Heinformed Littleton that he was going to build in order to please hiswife and daughter, and intimated that expense need not stand in the wayof the gratification of their wishes. After the business matters weredisposed of he was obviously ready to intrust all the artistic detailsto his architect. Consequently Littleton enjoyed an agreeable quarter ofan hour of exaltation. He was pleased at the prospect of building ahouse of this description, and the hope of being able to give free scopeto his architectural bent without molestation made that prospectroseate. He could desire no better opportunity for expressing his ideasand proving his capacity. It was an ideal chance, and his soul thrilledas he called up the shadowy fabric of scheme after scheme to fill thetrial canvas of his fantasy. Nor did he fail to award due credit toSelma for her share in the transaction; not to the extent, perhaps, ofconfessing incapacity on his own part, but by testifying lovingly to hercleverness. She was in too good humor at her success to insist on hishumiliation in set terms. The two points in which she was most vitallyinterested--the advantage of her own interference and the consequentprompt extension of her husband's field of usefulness--had beentriumphantly proved, and there was no need that the third--Wilbur's lackof capacity to battle and discriminate for himself--should beemphasized. Selma knew what she thought in her own mind, and sheentertained the hope that this lesson might be a lamp to his feet forfuture illumination. She was even generous enough to exclaim, placingher hands on his shoulders and looking into his face with complacentfervor:"You might have accomplished it just as well yourself, Wilbur."Littleton shook his head and smiled. "It was a case of witchery andfascination. He probably divined how eager you were to help me, and hewas glad to yield to the agreeable spell of your wifely devotion.""Oh, no," said Selma. "I am sure he never guessed for one moment of whatI was thinking. Of course, I did try to make him like me, but that wasonly sensible. To make people like one is the way to get business, Ibelieve."Littleton's quarter of an hour of exaltation was rudely checked by anote from Mrs. Parsons, requesting an interview in regard to the plans.When he presented himself he found her and her daughter imbued withdefinite ideas on the subject of architects and architecture. In theeyes of Mrs. Parsons the architect of her projected house was nothingbut a young man in the employ of her husband, who was to guide them asto measurements, carpentry, party-walls and plumbing, but was otherwiseto do her bidding for a pecuniary consideration, on the same generalbasis as the waiter at the hotel or the theatre ticket-agent. As toarchitecture, she expected him to draw plans just as she expecteddealers in carpets or wall-papers to show her patterns in easysuccession. "I don't care for that; take it away." "That is ratherpretty, but let me see something else." What she said to Littleton was,"We haven't quite decided yet what we want, but, if you'll bring someplans the next time you call, we'll let you know which we like best.There's a house in Vienna I saw once, which I said at the time toLucretia I would copy if I ever built. I've mislaid the photograph ofit, but I may be able to tell you when I see your drawings how itdiffered from yours. Lucretia has a fancy for something Moorish orOriental. I guess Mr. Parsons would prefer brown-stone, plain andmassive, but he has left it all to us, and both daughter and I thinkwe'd rather have a house which would speak for itself, and not be mixedup with everybody else's. You'd better bring us half a dozen to choosefrom, and between me and you and Lucretia, we'll arrive at somethingelegant and unique."This was sadly disillusionizing to Littleton, and the second experiencewas no less so. The refined outline sketches proffered by him wereunenthusiastically surveyed and languidly discarded like so manywall-papers. It was evident that both the mother and daughter weredisappointed, and Littleton presently divined that their chief objectionwas to the plainness of the several designs. This was made unmistakablyobvious when Mrs. Parsons, after exhibiting a number of photographs offoreign public buildings with which she had armed herself, surveyed themost ornate, holding it out with her head on one side, and exclaimedimpressively, "This is more the sort of thing we should like. I thinkMr. Parsons has already explained to you that he desired our house to beas handsome as possible.""I had endeavored to bear that in mind," Littleton retorted with spirit."I believe that either of these plans would give you a house which wouldbe handsome, interesting and in good taste.""It does not seem to me that there is anything unique about any ofthem," said Mrs. Parsons, with a cold sniff intended to be conclusive.Nor did Littleton's efforts to explain that elaboration in a privateresidence was liable to detract from architectural dignity and toproduce the effect of vulgarity fall upon receptive soil. The rich man'swife listened in stony silence, at times raising her lorgnette toexamine as a curiosity this young man who was telling her--an Americanwoman who had travelled around the world and seen everything to beseen--how she ought to build her own house. The upshot of this interviewwas that Littleton was sent away with languid instructions to try again.He departed, thinking melancholy thoughts and with fire in his soul,which, for Selma's sake, he endeavored to keep out of his eyes.CHAPTER VIII.The departure of the Williamses to a smarter neighborhood was a trialfor Selma. She nursed the dispiriting reflection that she and Wilburmight just as well be moving also; that a little foresight andshrewdness on her husband's part would have enabled him to sell at ahandsome profit the house in which they were living; and that there wasno reason, except the sheer, happy faculty of making the most ofopportunities, to account for the social recognition which Flossy andher husband were beginning to receive. It had not been easy to bear withequanimity during the last year the ingenuous, light-hearted warblingsin which Flossy had indulged as an outlet to her triumphant spirits, andto listen to naive recitals of new progress, as though she herself werea companion or ladies' maid, to whom such developments could neverhappen. She was weary of being merely a recipient of confidences and asympathetic listener, and more weary still of being regarded as such byher self-absorbed and successful neighbor. Why should Flossy be sodense? Why should she play second fiddle to Flossy? Why should Flossytake for granted that she did not intend to keep pace with her? Keeppace, indeed, when, if circumstances would only shape themselves alittle differently, she would be able speedily to outstrip her volatilefriend in the struggle for social preferment.Not unnaturally their friendship had been somewhat strained by thesimmering of these thoughts in Selma's bosom. If a recipient ofconfidences becomes tart or cold, ingenuous prattle is apt to flow lessspontaneously. Though Flossy was completely self-absorbed, andconsequently glad to pour out her satisfaction into a sympathetic ear,she began to realize that there was something amiss with her friendwhich mere conscientious disapproval of her own frivolities did notadequately explain. It troubled her somewhat, for she liked theLittletons and was proud of her acquaintance with them. However, she wasconscious of having acquitted herself toward them with liberality, and,especially now that her social vista was widening, she was not disposedat first to analyze too deeply the cause of the lack of sympathy betweenthem. That is, she was struck by Selma's offish manner and frigidsilences, but forgot them until they were forced upon her attention thenext time they met. But as her friend continued to receive her bubblingannouncements with stiff indifference, Flossy, in her perplexity, beganto bend her acute mental faculties more searchingly on her idol. A fixedpoint of view will keep a shrine sacred forever, but let a worshipper'sperspective be altered, and it is astonishing how different the featuresof divinity will appear. Flossy had worshipped with the eyes of faith.Now that her adoration was rejected without apparent cause, hercuriosity was piqued, and she sought an interpretation of the mysteryfrom her clever wits. As she observed Selma more dispassionately hersuspicion was stirred, and she began to wonder if she had been burningincense before a false goddess. This doubt was agitating her mind at thetime when they moved from the street.Selma was unconscious of the existence of this doubt as she had beenlargely unconscious of her own sour demeanor. She had no wish to losethe advantages of intimate association with the Williamses. On thecontrary, she expected to make progress on her own account by admissioninto their new social circle. She went promptly to call, and saw fit toshow herself tactfully appreciative of the new establishment and moreready to listen to Flossy's volubility. Flossy, who was radiant andbubbling over with fresh experiences which she was eager to impart, wasglad to dismiss her doubt and to give herself up to the delights ofunbridled speech. She took Selma over her new house, which had beenpurchased just as it stood, completely furnished, from the previousowner, who had suffered financial reverses. "Gregory bought it becauseit was really a bargain," she said. "It will do very well for thepresent, but we intend to build before long. I am keeping my eye on yourhusband, and am expecting great things from the Parsons house. Do youknow, I believe in Mr. Littleton, and feel sure that some day we shallwake up and find him famous."This was amiable, particularly as Flossy was very busily engaged incontemplating the brilliant progress of Gregory Williams and his wife.But Selma returned home feeling sore and dissatisfied. Flossy had beengracious, but still dense and naively condescending. Selma chose toforesee that her friend would neglect her, and her foresight wascorrect. The call was not returned for many weeks, although Flossy hadassured her when they separated that distance would make no differencein their intimacy. But in the first place, her doubts recurred to Flossyafter the departure of her visitor, and in the second, the agitationsincident to her new surroundings, fortified by these doubts, madeneglect easy. When she did call, Selma happened to be out. A few dayslater an invitation to dine with the Williamses arrived. Selma wouldhave preferred to remain at home as a rebuke, but she was miserablyconscious that Flossy would not perceive the point of the refusal. Soshe went, and was annoyed when she realized that the guests were onlypeople whom she knew already--the Parsonses, and some of GregoryWilliams's former associates, whom she had met at the old house. It wasa pleasant dinner, apparently, to all except Selma. The entertainmentwas flatteringly lavish, and both the host and hostess with suavity putin circulation, under the rose, the sentiment that there are no friendslike old friends--a graceful insincerity which most of them presentaccepted as true. Indeed, in one sense it was not an insincerity, forGregory and his wife entertained cordial feelings toward them all. Buton the other hand, Selma's immediate and bitter conclusion was alsotrue, that the company had been invited together for the reason that, inthe opinion of Flossy, they would not have harmonized well with anyoneelse.Said Wilbur as they drove away from the house--"Barring a few moments ofagony in the society of my tormentor, Mrs. Parsons, I had a pleasantevening. They were obviously potting their old acquaintance in one pie,but to my thinking it was preferable to being sandwiched in between someof their new friends whom we do not know and who know nothing of us. Itwas a little evident, but on the whole agreeable."Selma, shrouded in her wraps, made no reply at first. Suddenly sheexclaimed, with, fierceness, "I consider it rank impertinence. It was asmuch as to say that they do not think us good enough to meet their newfriends."Littleton, who still found difficulty in remembering that his wife wouldnot always enjoy the humor of an equivocal situation, was sorry that hehad spoken. "Come, Selma," he said, "there's no use in taking that viewof the matter. You would not really care to meet the other people.""Yes, I would, and she knows it. I shall never enter her house again.""As to that, my dear, the probabilities are that we shall not be askedfor some time. You know perfectly well that, in the nature of things,your intimacy with Mrs. Williams must languish now that she lives at adistance and has new surroundings. She may continue to be very fond ofyou, but you can't hope to see very much of her, unless I am greatlymistaken in her character.""She is a shallow little worldling," said Selma, with measuredintensity."But you knew that already. The fact that she invited us to dinner anddid not ignore our existence altogether shows that she likes us andwishes to continue the friendship. I've no doubt she believes that sheis going to see a great deal of us, and you should blame destiny and theforce of fashionable circumstances, not Flossy, if you drift apart.""She invited us because she wished to show off her new house.""Not altogether. You musn't be too hard on her."Selma moved her shoulders impatiently, and there was silence for somemoments broken only by the tapping of her foot. Then she asked, "Hownearly have you finished the plans for the Parsons house?"Wilbur's brow clouded under cover of the night. He hesitated an instantbefore replying, "I am sorry to say that Mrs. Parsons and I do not seemto get on very well together. Her ideas and mine on the subject ofarchitecture are wide apart, as I have intimated to you once or twice. Ihave modified my plans again, and she has made airy suggestions whichfrom my point of view are impossible. We are practically at loggerheads,and I am trying to make up my mind what I ought to do."There was a wealth of condensation in the word 'impossible' whichbrought back unpleasantly to Selma Pauline's use of the same word inconnection with the estimate which had been formed of Miss Bailey."There can be only one thing to do in the end," she said, "if you can'tagree. Mrs. Parsons, of course, must have her house as she wishes it. Itis her house, Wilbur.""It is her house, and she has that right, certainly. The question iswhether I am willing to allow the world to point to an architecturalhotch-potch and call it mine.""Isn't this another case of neglecting the practical side, Wilbur? I amsure you exaggerate the importance of the changes she desires. If I werebuilding a house, I should expect to have it built to suit me, and Ishould be annoyed if the architect stood on points and were captious."Selma under the influence of this more congenial theme had partiallyrecovered her equanimity. Her duty was her pleasure, and it was clearlyher duty to lead her husband in the right path and save him frombecoming the victim of his own shortcomings.Wilbur sighed. "I have told her," he said, "that I would submit anotherentirely new sketch. It may be that I can introduce some of her and herdaughter's splurgy and garish misconceptions without making myselfhopelessly ridiculous."He entered the house wearily, and as he stood before the hall tableunder the chandelier, Selma took him by the arm and turning him towardher gazed into his face. "I wish to examine you. Pauline said to meto-day that she thinks you are looking pale. I don't see that you are;no more so than usual. You never were rosy exactly. Do you know I havean idea that she thinks I am working you to death.""Pauline? What reason has she to think anything of the kind? Besides, Iam perfectly well. It is a delight to work for a woman like you,dearest." He took her face between his hands and kissed her tenderly;yet gravely, too, as though the riddle of life did not solve itself atthe touch of her lips. "You will be interested to hear," he added, "thatI shall finish and send off the Wetmore College plans this week.""I am glad they are off your hands, for you will have more time forother work.""Yes. I think I may have done something worth while," he said,wistfully."And I shall try not to be annoyed if someone else gets the award," sheresponded, smoothing down the sheen of her evening dress and regardingherself in the mirror."Of course someone else may have taken equal pains and done a betterthing. It is necessary always to be prepared for that.""That is the trouble. That is why I disapprove of competitions.""Selma, you are talking nonsense," Littleton exclaimed with suddensternness.The decision in his tone made her start. The color mounted to her face,and she surveyed him for an instant haughtily, as though he had done heran injury. Then with an oratorical air and her archangel look, she said,"You do not seem to understand, Wilbur, that I am trying to save youfrom yourself."Littleton was ever susceptible to that look of hers. It suggestedincarnate conscientiousness, and seemed incompatible with humanimperfection or unworthy ambitions. He was too wroth to relentaltogether, but he compressed his lips and returned her looksearchingly, as though he would scrutinize her soul."I'm bound to believe, I do believe, that you are trying to help me,Selma. I need your advice and help, even against myself, I dare say. Butthere are some matters of which you cannot judge so well as I. You musttrust my opinion where the development of my professional life isconcerned. I shall not forget your caution to be practical, but for thesake of expediency I cannot be false to what I believe true. Come, dear,let us go to bed."He put his hand on her arm to lead her upstairs, but she turned from itto collect her fan and gloves. Looking, not at him, but at herself inthe mirror, she answered, "Of course. I trust, though, that this doesnot mean you intend to act foolishly in regard to the Parsons house.""I have already told you," he said, looking back, "that I am going tomake another attempt to satisfy that exasperating woman and herdaughter.""And you can satisfy them, I'm sure, if you only choose to," said Selma,by way of a firm, final observation.Littleton's prophecy in regard to the waning of friendship between hiswife and Mrs. Williams proved to be correct. Propinquity had made themintimate, and separation by force of circumstances put a summary end tofrequent and cordial intercourse between them. As he had predicted,their first invitation to the new house was still the last at the end ofthree months, and save for a few words on one occasion in the street,Selma and Flossy did not meet during that period. But during that samethree months Selma's attention was constantly attracted to theWilliamses by prominent newspaper allusions to their prosperity andgrowing fashionable prestige. What they did and where they went werechronicled in the then new style journalistic social gossip, and theevery-day world was made familiar with his financial opinions and hisequipages and her toilettes. The meeting in the street was an ordeal forSelma. Flossy had been shopping and was about to step into her carriage,the door of which was held open by an imposing liveried footman, whenthe two women nearly collided."I have not seen you for an age," Flossy exclaimed, with the genuinering of regret in her tone, with which busy people partially atone forhaving left undone the things they ought or would like to have done."Which way are you going? Can't I take you somewhere?"Selma glanced sternly at the snug coupe and stylish horses. "No, wedon't seem to meet very often," she said drily. "I'm living, though, atthe same place," she added, with a determination to be sprightly."Yes, I know; I owe you a call. It's dreadful of me. I've been intendingto come, but you can't imagine how busy I've been. Such a number ofinvitations, and new things to be done. I'm looking forward to givingyou a full account of my experiences.""I've read about them in the newspapers.""Oh, yes. Gregory is always civil to reporters. He says that thenewspapers are one of the great institutions of the country, and that itis sensible to keep in touch with them. I will confide to you that Ithink the whole business vulgar, and I intend some day, when we arefirmly established, to be ugly to them. But at present the publicity israther convenient and amusing," she exclaimed, with a gay shake of herhead, which set her ringlets bobbing."I should think it would be unpleasant to have the details of one'sappearance described by the press."Flossy's doubts had returned in full force during the conversation. Shesaid to herself, "I wonder if that is true? I wonder if it wouldn't bethe very thing she would like?" But she answered blithely, "Oh, one getsused to it. Then I can't take you anywhere? I'm sorry. Some day I hopemy round of gayety will cease, so that we can have a quiet eveningtogether. I miss your husband. I always find him suggestive andinteresting.""'Her round of gayety! A quiet evening together!'" murmured Selma as shewalked away. "Wilbur is right; purse-proud, frivolous little thing! Sheis determined to destroy our friendship."Four weeks subsequent to this meeting the newspapers contained a fulsomeaccount of a dancing party given by Mr. and Mrs. Gregory Williams--"anelegant and recherche entertainment," in the language of the reporter. Alist of the company followed, which Selma scrutinized with a brow like athunder-cloud. She had acquired a feverish habit of perusing similarlists, and she recognized that Flossy's guests--among the first of whomwere Mr. and Mrs. Morton Price and the Misses Price--were chieflyconfined to persons whom she had learned to know as members offashionable society. She read, in the further phraseology of thereporter, that "it was a small and select affair." At the end of thelist, as though they had been invited on sufferance as a businessnecessity, were the Parsonses; but these were the only former associatesof the Williamses. Selma had just finished her second reading of thisnews item when her meditation was interrupted by the voice of herhusband, who had been silent during dinner, as though he had some matteron his mind, and was at the moment sitting close by, on the other sideof the lamp which lighted the library table."I fear you will be disappointed, Selma, but I have informed Mr. Parsonsdefinitely this morning, that he must get another architect. The ideasof his wife and daughter are hopelessly at variance with mine. He seemedto be sorry--indeed, I should think he was a reasonable and sensibleman--but he said that he was building to please Mrs. Parsons, and weboth agreed that under the circumstances it was necessary that sheshould make a fresh start. He asked me to send my bill, and we parted onthe best of terms. So it is all over, and except from the point of viewof dollars and cents, I am very glad. Only the remembrance that you hadset your heart on my making this my masterpiece, prevented me fromthrowing over the contract weeks ago. Tell me, Selma _mia_, that youapprove of what I have done and congratulate me." He pulled forward hischair so that he might see her face without interference from the lampand leaned toward her with frank appeal."Yes, I had set my heart on it, and you knew it. Yet you preferred togive up this fine opportunity to show what you could do and to getbusiness worth having rather than sacrifice your own ideas as to how ahouse should be built to the ideas of the women who were to live in it.I dare say I should agree with them, and that the things which theywished and you objected to were things I would have insisted on having."Littleton started as though she had struck him in the face. "Selma! Mywife! Do you realize what you are saying?""Perfectly.""Then--then--. Why, what have I said, what have I done that you shouldtalk like this?""Done? Everything. For one thing you have thrown away the chance forgetting ahead in your profession which I procured for you. For another,by your visionary, unpractical ways, you have put me in the positionwhere I can be insulted. Read that, and judge for yourself." She heldout to him the newspaper containing the account of the dancing party,pointing with her finger to the obnoxious passage.With nervous hands Littleton drew the page under the light. "What is allthis about? A party? What has it to do with our affairs?""It has this to do with them--if you had been more practical andenterprising, our names would have been on that list.""I am glad they are not there.""Yes, I know. You would be content to have us remain nobodies all ourdays. You do not care what becomes of my life, provided you can carryout your own narrow theory of how we ought to live. And I had such faithin you, too! I have refused to believe until now that you were nottrying to make the most of your opportunities, and to enable me to makethe most of mine.""Selma, are you crazy? To think that you, the woman I have loved withall my soul, should be capable of saying such things to me! What does itmean?"She was quick to take advantage of his phrase. "Have loved? Yes, I knowthat you do not love me as you did; otherwise you could not have refusedto build that house, against my wish and advice. It means this, WilburLittleton, that I am determined not to let you spoil my life. You forgetthat in marrying you I gave up my own ambitions and hopes for your sake;because--because I believed that by living together we should be more,and accomplish more, than by living apart. You said you needed me, and Iwas fool enough to believe it."The fierce tragedy in her tone lapsed into self-pity under the influenceof her last thought, and Littleton, eager in his bewilderment for someescape from the horror of the situation, put aside his anger anddropping on his knees beside her tried to take her hands."You are provoked, my darling. Do not say things which you will be sorryfor to-morrow. I call God to witness that I have sought above all elseto make you happy, and if I have failed, I am utterly miserable. I haveneeded you, I do need you. Do not let a single difference of opinionspoil the joy of both our lives and divide our hearts."She pulled her hands away, and shunning his endearment, rose to herfeet."I am provoked, but I know what I am saying. A single difference ofopinion? Do you not see, Wilbur, that none of our opinions are the same,and that we look at everything differently? Even your religion and theGod you call to witness are not mine. They are stiff and cold; youUnitarians permit your consciences to deaden your emotions and belittleyour outlook on life. When I went with Mr. Parsons the other day to theMethodist church, I could not help thinking how different it was. I wasthrilled and I felt I could do anything and be anything. My mother was aMethodist. They sang 'Onward Christian Soldiers,' and it was glorious."She paused a moment and, with an exalted look, seemed to be recallingthe movement of the hymn. "With you, Wilbur, and the people likeyou--Pauline is the same--everything is measured and pondered over, andnothing is spontaneous. I like action, and progress and prompt, sensibleconclusions. That is the American way, and the way in which people whosucceed get on. But you won't see it--you can't see it. I've tried toexplain it to you, and now--now it's too late. We're nobodies, and, ifour hearts are divided, that's fate I suppose. It's a very cruel fatefor me. But I don't choose to remain a nobody."Littleton's expression as she talked had changed from astonishment toanger, and from anger to a sternness which gave his words of responsethe effect of calm and final decision. "You have said so many thingswith which I do not agree, and which I should have to dispute, that Iwill not attempt to argue with you concerning them. One thing is clear,both of us have made a horrible mistake. Each has misunderstood theother. You are dissatisfied with me; I realize suddenly that you areutterly different from what I supposed. I am overwhelmed, but your wordsmake plain many things which have distressed and puzzled me." He pausedas though in spite of the certainty of his tone, he hoped that she wouldsee fit to deny his conclusions. "We have made a mistake and we shallboth be miserable--that must needs be--but we must consider whetherthere is any method by which we can be less unhappy. What would you liketo have me do, Selma? We have no children, thank heaven! Would it bemore agreeable to live apart from me and receive support? A divorce doesnot seem necessary. Besides, our misconception of each other wouldnot be a legal cause."Selma flushed at the reference to divorce. Littleton's sad, simplestatement wore on the surface no sign of a design to hark back to herexperience with her first husband, yet she divined that it must be inhis thoughts and she resented the recurrence. Moreover, separation,certainly for the present, went beyond her purpose."I have no wish for divorce or separation. I see no reason why we shouldnot continue to live as we are," she answered. "To separate would causescandal. It is not necessary that people should know we have made amistake. I shall merely feel more free now to live my own life--andthere is no telling that you may not some day see things from my pointof view and sympathize with me more." She uttered the last words with amixture of pathos and bright solicitation.Littleton shook his head. "I agree with you that to go on as we are isour best course. As you say, we ought, if possible, to keep theknowledge of our sorrow to ourselves. God knows that I wish I could hopethat our life could ever be as it was before. Too many things havebecome plain to me in the last half-hour to make that possible. I couldnever learn to accept or sympathize with your point of view. There canbe no half-love with me, Selma. It is my nature to be frank, and as youare fond of saying, that is the American way. I am your husband still,and while I live you shall have my money and my protection. But I haveceased to be your lover, though my heart is broken.""Very well," said Selma, after a painful pause. "But you know, Wilbur,"she added in a tone of eager protestation, "that I do not admit for amoment that I am at fault. I was simply trying to help you. You haveonly yourself to blame for your unhappiness and--and for mine. I hopeyou understand that.""Yes, I understand that you think so," he said sadly.CHAPTER IX.The breach between Littleton and his wife was too serious to be healed,for he was confronted by the conviction that Selma was a very differentbeing from the woman whom he had supposed that he was marrying. He hadbeen slow to harbor distrust, and loath, even in the face of her ownwords, to admit that he had misinterpreted her character; but this lastconversation left no room for doubt. Selma had declared to him,unequivocally, that his ideas and theory of life were repugnant to her,and that, henceforth, she intended to act independently of them, so faras she could do so, and yet maintain the semblance of the married state.It was a cruel shock and disappointment to him. At the time of hismarriage he would have said that the least likely of possible happeningswould be self-deception as to the character of the woman he loved. Yetthis was precisely what had befallen him.Having realized his mistake, he did not seek to flinch from the bittertruth. He saw clearly that their future relations toward each other mustbe largely formal; that tender comradeship and mutual soul alliance wereat an end. At the same time his simple, direct conscience promptlyindicated to him that it was his duty to recognize Selma's point of viewand endeavor to satisfy it as far as he could without sacrifice of hisown principles. He chose to remember that she, too, had made a mistake,and that he was not the kind of husband whom she desired; that histastes were not her tastes, nor his ambitions her's; that she had tastesand ambitions of her own which he, as the man to whom she was bound bythe law, must not disregard. Thus reasoning, he resolved to carry outthe scheme of life which she appeared to despise, but also to work hardto provide her with the means to fulfil her own aims. She craved moneyfor social advancement. She should have it from him, for there was noother source from which she could obtain it. The poignancy of his ownsorrow should not cause him to ignore that she had given up her owncareer and pursuits in order to become his wife, and was nowdisappointed and without independent resources. His pride was sorelywounded, his ideals shattered and his heart crushed; yet, though hecould not forbear from judging Selma, and was unconscious of havingfailed in his obligations to her as a husband and a man, he saw what shecalled her side, and he took up the thread of life again under the spurof an intention to give her everything but love.On her part Selma felt aggrieved yet emancipated. She had not looked forany such grave result from her vituperation. She had intended to reprovehis surrender of the Parsons's contract, in direct opposition to her ownwishes, with the severity it deserved, and to let him understand clearlythat he was sacrificing her happiness, no less than his own, by hishysterical folly. When the conversation developed stubborn resistance onhis part, and she realized that he was defending and adhering to hispurpose, a righteous sense of injury became predominant in her mind overeverything else. All her past wrongs cried for redress, and she rejoicedin the opportunity of giving free vent to the pent up grievances whichhad been accumulating for many months. Even then it was startling to herthat Wilbur should suddenly utter the tragic ultimatum that theirhappiness was at an end, and hint at divorce. She considered that sheloved him, and it had never occurred to her that he could ever cease tolove her. Rather than retract a word of her own accusations she wouldhave let him leave her, then and there, to live her own life withoutprotection or support from him, but his calmer decision that they shouldcontinue to live together, yet apart, suited her better. In spite of hisresolute mien she was sceptical of the seriousness of the situation. Shebelieved in her heart that after a few days of restraint they wouldresume their former life, and that Wilbur, on reflection, wouldappreciate that he had been absurd.When it became apparent that he was not to be appeased and that histhreat had been genuine, Selma accepted the new relation without demur,and prepared to play her part in the compact as though she had beenequally obdurate in her outcry for her freedom. She met reserve withreserve, maintaining rigorously the attitude that she had been wrongedand that he was to blame. Meantime she watched him narrowly, wonderingwhat his grave, sad demeanor and solicitous politeness signified. Whenpresently it became plain to her that not merely she was to be free tofollow her own bent, but that he was ready to provide her with the meansto carry out her schemes, she regarded his liberality as weakness and asign that he knew in his heart that she was in the right. Immediately,and with thinly concealed triumph, she planned to utilize the newliberty at her disposal, purging any scruples from her conscience by thegenerous reflection that when Wilbur's brow unbent and his lips movedfreely she would forgive him and proffer him once more her conjugalcounsel and sympathy. She was firmly of the opinion that, unless he thusacknowledged his shortcomings and promised improvement, the presentarrangement was completely to her liking, and that confidence andhappiness between them would be utterly impossible. She shed some tearsover the thought that unkind circumstances had robbed her of the love bywhich she had set such store and which she, on her part, stillcherished, but she comforted herself with the retort that its loss waspreferable to sacrificing weakly the development of her own ideas andlife to its perpetuation.Her flush of triumph was succeeded, however, by a discontented mood,because cogitation constrained her to suspect that her social progressmight not be so rapid as her first rosy visions had suggested. Shecounted on being able to procure the participation of Wilbursufficiently to preserve the appearance of domestic harmony. This wouldbe for practical purposes a scarcely less effective furtherance of herplans than if he were heartily in sympathy with them. Were there notmany instances where busy husbands took part in the social undertakingsof their wives, merely on the surface, to preserve appearances? Theattitude of Wilbur seemed reasonably secure. That which harassed her asthe result of her reflections and efforts to plan was the unpalatableconsciousness that she did not know exactly what to do, and that no one,even now that she was free, appeared eager to extend to her the hand ofrecognition. She was prompt to lay the blame of this on her husband. Itwas he who, by preventing her from taking advantage of the socialopportunities at their disposal, had consigned her to this eddy whereshe was overlooked. This seemed to her a complete excuse, and yet,though she made the most of it, it did not satisfy her. Her helplessnessangered her, and aroused her old feelings of suspicion and resentmentagainst the fashionable crew who appeared to be unaware of herexistence. She was glad to believe that the reason they ignored her wasbecause she was too serious minded and spiritual to suit their frivolousand pleasure-loving tastes. Sometimes she reasoned that the sensiblething for her to do was to break away from her present life, whereconvention and caste trammelled her efforts, and make a name for herselfas an independent soul, like Mrs. Margaret Rodney Earle and otherfree-born women of the Republic. With satisfaction she pictured herselfon the lecture platform uttering burning denunciation of the un-Americansocial proclivities of this shallow society, and initiating a crusadewhich should sweep it from existence beneath the ban of the moral senseof the thoughtful people of the country.But more frequently she nursed her resentment against Mrs. Williams, towhom she ascribed the blame of her isolation, reasoning that if Flossyhad been a true friend, not even Wilbur's waywardness would haveprevented her social recognition and success. That, instead, thisvolatile, fickle prattler had used her so long as she needed her, andthen dropped her heartlessly. The memory of Flossy's ball still rankleddeeply, and appeared to Selma a more obvious and more exasperatinginsult as the days passed without a sign of explanation on the part ofher late neighbor, and as her new projects languished for lack of a fewwords of introduction here and there, which, in her opinion, were allshe needed to ensure her enthusiastic welcome as a social leader. Theappreciation that without those words of introduction she was helplessfor the time being focused her resentment, already keen, on thesuccessful Flossy, whose gay doings had disappeared from the publicprints in a blaze of glory with the advent of the Lenten season.Refusing to acknowledge her dependence, Selma essayed several spasmodicattempts to assert herself, but they proved unsatisfactory. She made themost of Mr. Parsons's predilection for her society, which had not beenchecked by Wilbur's termination of the contract. She was thus enabled toaffiliate with some of their new friends, but she was disagreeablyconscious that she was not making real progress, and that Mr. and Mrs.Parsons and their daughter had, like herself, been dropped by theWilliamses--dropped skilfully and imperceptibly, yet none the lessdropped. Two dinner parties, which she gave in the course of a fortnightto the most important of these new acquaintances, by way of manifestingto Wilbur her intention to enjoy her liberty at his expense, left herdepressed and sore.It was just at this time that Flossy took it into her head to call onher--one of her first Lenten duties, as she hastened to assure Selma,with glib liveliness, as soon as she entered. Flossy was in too exalteda frame of mind, too bubbling over with the desire to recite hertriumphs, to have in mind either her doubts concerning Selma or the needof being more than mildly apologetic for her lack of devotion. She feltfriendly, for she was in good humor, and was naively desirous to bereceived in the same spirit, so that she might unbosom herselfunreservedly. Sweeping into the room, an animated vision of smiling,stylish cordiality, she sought, as it were, to carry before her by forceof her own radiant mood all obstacles to an amiable reception."My dear, we haven't met for ages. Thank heaven, Lent has come, and nowI may see something of you. I said to Gregory only yesterday that Ishould make a bee-line for your house, and here I am. Well, dear, howare you? All sorts of things have happened, Selma, since we've had areal chat together. Do you remember my telling you--of course youdo--not long after Gregory and I were married that I never should besatisfied until one thing happened? Well, you may congratulate me; ithas happened. We dined a week ago to-night with my cousins--the MortonPrices--a dinner of fourteen, all of them just the people I wished toknow. Wasn't it lovely? I have waited for it to come, and I haven'tmoved a finger to bring it about, except to ask them to my dancingparty--I had to do that, for after all they are my relations. Theyaccepted and came and I was pleased by it; but they could easily haveignored me afterward if they had wished. What really pleased me, Selma,was their asking me to one of their select dinners, because--because itshowed that we are--"Flossy's hesitation was due partly to the inherent difficulty ofexpressing her thought with proper regard for modesty. With her rise inlife she had learned that unlimited laudation of self was not altogetherconsistent with "fitness," even in such a confidential interview as thepresent. But she was also disconcerted by the look in Selma's eyes--alook which, at first startled into momentary friendliness by thesuddenness of the onslaught, had become more and more lowering until itwas unpleasantly suggestive of scornful dislike. While she thusfaltered, Selma drily rounded out the sentence with the words, "Becauseit showed that you are somebodies now."Flossy gave an embarrassed little laugh. "Yes, that's what I meant. Isee you have a good memory, and it sounds nicer on your lips than itwould on mine.""You have come here to-day on purpose to tell me this?" said Selma."I thought you would be interested to hear that my cousins hadrecognized me at last. I remember, you thought it strange that theyshould take so little notice of me." Flossy's festive manner haddisappeared before the tart reception of her confidences, and her keenwits, baffled in their search for flattery, recalled the suspicionswhich were only slumbering. She realized that Selma was seriouslyoffended with her, and though she did not choose to acknowledge toherself that she knew the cause, she had already guessed it. Anencounter at repartee had no terrors for her, if necessary, and theoccasion seemed to her opportune for probing the accumulating mysteriesof Selma's hostile demeanor. Yet, without waiting for a response to herlast remark, she changed the subject, and said, volubly, "I hear thatyour husband has refused to build the new Parsons house because Mrs.Parsons insisted on drawing the plans."Selma's pale, tense face flushed. She thought for a moment that she wasbeing taunted."That was Mr. Littleton's decision, not mine.""I admire his independence. He was quite right. What do Mrs. Parsons orher daughter know about architecture? Everybody is laughing at them. Youknow I consider your husband a friend of mine, Selma.""And we were friends, too, I believe?" Selma exclaimed, after a momentof stern silence."Naturally," responded Flossy, with a slightly sardonic air, prompted bythe acerbity with which the question was put."Then, if we were friends--are friends, why have you ceased to associatewith us, simply because you live in another street and a finer house?"Flossy gave a gasp. "Oh," she said to herself, "it's true. She isjealous. Why didn't I appreciate it before?""Am I not associating with you now by calling on you, Selma?" she saidaloud. "I don't understand what you mean.""You are calling on me, and you asked us to dinner to meet--to meet justthe people we knew already, and didn't care to meet; but you have neverasked us to meet your new friends, and you left us out when you gaveyour dancing party.""You do not dance.""How do you know?""I have never associated you with dancing. I assumed that you did notdance.""What grounds had you for such an assumption?""Really, Selma, your catechism is most extraordinary. Excuse my smiling.And I don't know how to answer your questions--your fierce questions anybetter. I didn't ask you to my party because I supposed that you andyour husband were not interested in that sort of thing, and would notknow any of the people. You have often told me that you thought theywere frivolous.""I consider them so still.""Then why do you complain?""Because--because you have not acted like a friend. Your idea offriendship has been to pour into my ears, day after day, how you hadbeen asked to dinner by this person and taken up by that person, until Iwas weary of the sound of your voice, but it seems not to have occurredto you, as a friend of mine, and a friend and admirer of my husband, tointroduce us to people whom you were eager to know, and who might havehelped him in his profession. And now, after turning the cold shoulderon us, and omitting us from your party, because you assumed I didn'tdance, you have come here this morning, in the name of friendship, totell me that your cousins, at last, have invited you to dinner. And yetyou think it strange that I'm not interested. That's the only reason youcame--to let me know that you are a somebody now; and you expected me,as a friend and a nobody, to tell you how glad I am."Flossy's eyes opened wide. Free as she was accustomed to be in her ownutterances, this flow of bitter speech delivered with seer-likeintensity was a new experience to her. She did not know whether to beangry or amused by the indictment, which caused her to wincenotwithstanding that she deemed it slander. Moreover the insinuationthat she had been a bore was humiliating."I shall not weary you soon again with my confidences," she answered."So it appears that you were envious of me all the time--that while youwere preaching to me that fashionable society was hollow andun-American, you were secretly unhappy because you couldn't do what Iwas doing--because you weren't invited, too. Oh, I see it all now; it'sclear as daylight. I've suspected the truth for some time, but I'verefused to credit it. Now everything is explained. I took you at yourword; I believed in you and your husband and looked up to you asliterary people--people who were interested in fine and ennoblingthings. I admired you for the very reason that I thought you didn'tcare, and that you didn't need to care, about society and fashionableposition. I kept saying to you that I envied you your tastes, and letyou see that I considered myself your real inferior in my determinationto attract attention and oblige society to notice us. I was guilelessand simpleton enough to tell you of my progress--things I would haveblushed to tell another woman like myself--because I considered you theembodiment of high aims and spiritual ideas, as far superior to mine asthe poetic star is superior to the garish electric light. I thought itmight amuse you to listen to my vanities. Instead, it seems you weremasquerading and were eating your heart out with envy of me--poor me.You were ambitious to be like me.""I wouldn't be like you for anything in the world.""You couldn't if you tried. That's one of the things which thisextraordinary interview has made plain beyond the shadow of a doubt. Youare aching to be a social success. You are not fit to be. I have foundthat out for certain to-day.""It is false," exclaimed Selma, with a tragic intonation. "You do notunderstand. I have no wish to be a social success. I should abhor tospend my life after the manner of you and your associates. What I objectto, what I complain of, is that, in spite of your fine words andpretended admiration of me, you have preferred these people, who areexclusive without a shadow of right, to me who was your friend, and thatyou have chosen to ignore me for the sake of them, and behaved as if youthought I was not their equal or your equal. That is not friendship, itis snobbishness--un-American snobbishness.""It is very amusing. Amusing yet depressing," continued Flossy, withoutheed to this asseveration. "You have proved one of my ideals to be adelusion, which is sad." She had arisen and stood gently swaying pendentby its crook her gay parasol, with her head on one side, and seeming foronce to be choosing her words judicially. "When we met first and Inearly rushed into your arms, I was fascinated, and I said to myselfthat here was the sort of American woman of whom I had dreamed--the sortof woman I had fondly imagined once that I might become. I saw you wereunsophisticated and different from the conventional women to whom I wasaccustomed, and, even at first, the things you said every now and thengave me a creepy feeling, but you were inspiring to look at--though nowthat the scales have fallen from my eyes I wonder at my infatuation--andI continued to worship you as a goddess on a pedestal. I used to say toGregory, 'there's a couple who are to the manner born; they never haveto make believe. They are genuinely free and gentle souls.' Yourhusband? I can't believe that I have been deluded in regard to him,also. I just wonder if you appreciate him--if it is possible that he hasbeen deluded, also. That's rank impertinence, I know; but after all, weare unbosoming our thoughts to each other to-day, and may as well speakopenly. You said just now that it was his decision not to go on with theParsons house. Did you disapprove of it?""Yes, I disapproved of it," answered Selma with flashing eyes. "And whatif I did?"She rose and stood confronting her visitor as though to banish her fromthe house."I'm going," said Flossy. "It's none of my concern of course, and I'maware that I appear very rude. I'm anxious though not to lose faith inyour husband, and now that I've begun to understand you, my wits arebeing flooded with light. I was saying that you were not fit to be asocial success, and I'm going to tell you why. No one else is likely to,and I'm just mischievous and frank enough. You're one of those Americanwomen--I've always been curious to meet one in all her glory--whobelieve that they are born in the complete panoply of flawlesswomanhood; that they are by birthright consummate house-wives, leadersof the world's thought and ethics, and peerless society queens. All thisby instinct, by heritage, and without education. That's what youbelieve, isn't it? And now you are offended because you haven't beeninvited to become a leader of New York society. You don't understand,and I don't suppose you ever will understand, that a true lady--agenuine society queen--represents modesty and sweetness andself-control, and gentle thoughts and feelings; that she is evolved bygradual processes from generation to generation, not ready made. Oh, youneedn't look at me like that. I'm quite aware that if I were the genuinearticle I shouldn't be talking to you in this fashion. But there's hopefor me because I'm conscious of my shortcomings and am trying to correctthem; whereas you are satisfied, and fail to see the difference betweenyourself and the well-bred women whom you envy and sneer at. You'repretty and smart and superficial and--er--common, and you don't know it.I'm rather dreadful, but I'm learning. I don't believe you will everlearn. There! Now I'm going.""Go!" cried Selma with a wave of her arm. "Yes, I am one of those women.I am proud to be, and you have insulted by your aspersions, not only me,but the spirit of independent and aspiring American womanhood. You don'tunderstand us; you have nothing in common with us. You think to keep usdown by your barriers of caste borrowed from effete European courts, butwe--I--the American people defy you. The time will come when we shallrise in our might and teach you your place. Go! Envy you? I would notbecome one of your frivolous and purposeless set if you were all on yourbended knees before me.""Oh, yes you would," exclaimed Flossy, glancing back over her shoulder."And it's because you've not been given the chance that we havequarrelled now."CHAPTER X.The morning after her drastic interview with Mrs. Williams, Selmastudied herself searchingly in her mirror. Of all Flossy's candidstrictures the intimation that she was not and never would be completelya lady was the only one which rankled. The effrontery of it made herblood boil; and yet she consulted her glass in the seclusion of herchamber in order to reassure herself as to the spiteful falsity of thecriticism. Wild horses would not have induced her to admit even toherself that there was the slightest ground for it; still it rankled,thereby suggesting a sub-consciousness of suspicion on the look out forjust such a calumny.She gave Littleton her own version of the quarrel. Her explanation wasthat she had charged Flossy with a lack of friendship in failing toinvite her to her ball, and convicted her of detestable snobbery; thatshe had denounced this conduct in vigorous language, that they hadparted in anger, and that all intercourse between them was at an end."We understand each other now," she added. "I have felt for some timethat we were no longer sympathetic; and that something of this kind wasinevitable. I am glad that we had the chance to speak plainly, for I wasable to show her that I had been waiting for an excuse to cut loose fromher and her frivolous surroundings. I have wearied my spirit long enoughwith listening to social inanities, and in lowering my standards to hersfor the sake of appearing friendly and conventional. That is all overnow, thank heaven."It did not occur to Selma that there was any inconsistency in theseobservations, or that they might appear a partial vindication of herhusband's point of view. The most salient effect of her encounter withFlossy had been suddenly to fuse and crystallize her mixed and seeminglycontradictory ambitions into utter hostility to conventional fashionablesociety. Even when her heart had been hungering for an invitation toFlossy's ball, she considered that she despised these people, but theinterview had served to establish her in the glowing faith that they, bytheir inability to appreciate her, had shown themselves unworthy offurther consideration. The desire which she had experienced of late fora renewal of her intimacy with Mrs. Earle and a reassertion of herformer life of independent feminine activity had returned to her,coupled with the crusading intention to enroll herself openly once morein the army of new American women, whose impending victorious campaignshe had prophesied in her retort to Mrs. Williams's maledictions. Shehad, in her own opinion, never ceased to belong to this army, and shefelt herself now more firmly convinced than ever that the course of lifeof those who had turned a cold shoulder on her was hostile to the spiritof American institutions. So far as her husband was concerned,imaginative enterprise and the capacity to take advantage ofopportunities still seemed to her of the essence of fine character.Indeed, she was not conscious of any change in her point of view. Shehad resented Flossy's charge that she desired to be a social success,and had declared that her wounded feelings were solely due to Flossy'sbetrayal of friendship, not to balked social ambition. Consequently itwas no strain on her conscientiousness to feel that her real sentimentshad always been the same.Nevertheless she scrutinized herself eagerly and long in her mirror, andthe process left her serious brow still clouded. She saw in the glassfeatures which seemed to her suggestive of superior womanhood, a slenderclear-cut nose, the nostrils of which dilated nervously, delicatelythin, compressed lips, a pale, transparent complexion, and clear,steel-like, greenish-brown eyes looking straight and boldly from ananxious forehead surmounted with a coiffure of elaborately and smoothlyarranged hair. She saw indisputable evidence that she had ceased to bethe ethically attractive, but modishly unsophisticated and physicallyundeveloped girl, who had come to New York five years before, for herfigure was compact without being unduly plump, her cheeks becominglyoval, and her toilette stylish. There were rings on her fingers, and herneck-gear was smart. Altogether the vision was satisfactory, yet sherecognized as she gazed that her appearance and general effect were notprecisely those of Flossy, Pauline, or Mrs. Hallett Taylor. She hadalways prided herself on the distinction of her face, and admiredespecially its freedom from gross or unintellectual lines. She did notintend to question its superiority now; but Flossy's offensive wordsrang in her ears and caused her to gnaw her lips with annoyance. Whatwas the difference between them? Flossy had dared to call her common andsuperficial; had dared to insinuate that she never could be a lady. Alady? What was there in her appearance not lady-like? In what way wasshe the inferior of any of them in beauty, intelligence or character?Rigorous as was the scrutiny, the face in the mirror seemed to her anunanswerable refutation of the slander. What was the difference? Was itthat her eyes were keener and brighter, her lips thinner and lessfleshly, her general expression more wide-awake and self-reliant? If so,were these not signs of superiority; signs that they, not she, weredeficient in the attributes of the best modern womanhood in spite oftheir affectation of exclusiveness?The result of this process of self-examination in her looking-glass,which was not limited to a single occasion, established more firmly thanever in Selma's opinion the malignant falsity of the imputation, and yetshe was still haunted by it. She was tortured by the secret thoughtthat, though her ambition had been to become just like those otherwomen, she was still distinguishable from them; and moreover, that shewas baffled in her attempt to analyze the distinction. Distinguishableeven from Flossy--from Flossy, who had slighted and then reviled her!Why had she ever faltered in her distrust of these enemies of trueAmerican society? Yet this lingering sense of torture served to whet hernew-found purpose to have done with them forever, and to obtain therecognition and power to which she was entitled, in spite of theirimpertinence and neglect.The announcement was made to her by Wilbur at about this time that hisplans for Wetmore College had been accepted, and that he was to be thearchitect of the new buildings. As he told her his face showed atremulous animation which it had not worn for many weeks, and heregarded her for a moment with shy eagerness, as though he half hopedthat this vindication of his purposes by success might prompt her totender some sort of apology, and thus afford him the chance to persuadehimself that he had been mistaken after all in his judgment of her."You must be very much pleased," she said. "And so am I, of course."Then, after a moment of reflective abstraction, she asked with suddeneagerness, "How long will it take to build them?""Two or three years, I suppose.""And you would be obliged to go frequently to Benham?""In order to oversee the work I should have to make short trips therefrom time to time.""Yes. Wilbur," she exclaimed, with her exalted expression, "whyshouldn't we go to Benham to live? I have been thinking a great deallately about what we said to each other that time when you felt sobadly, and I have come to the conclusion that our living in New York iswhat is really the trouble. I have the feeling, Wilbur, that in someother place than this cruel, conventional city we should be happier thanwe are now--indeed, very happy. Has it ever occurred to you? You see,New York doesn't understand me; it doesn't understand you, Wilbur. Itsneers at our aspirations. Benham is a growing, earnest city--a citythrobbing with the best American spirit and energy. I suggest Benhambecause we both know it so well. The college buildings would give you agrand start, and I--we both would be in our proper sphere."Littleton had started at the suggestion. As a drowning man will grasp ata straw, his grieving soul for an instant entertained the plan as apanacea for their woes. But his brow grew grave and sad under theinfluence of reflection as she proceeded to set forth her reasons in herwrapt fashion. If he had not learned to remain cold under the witcheryof her intense moods, he no longer hesitated to probe her fervidassertions with his self-respecting common-sense."I would he willing to go to the ends of the earth, Selma," he answered,"if I believed that by so doing you and I could become what we once wereto each other. But I cannot see why we should hope to be happier inBenham than here, nor do I agree with you that this is not our propersphere. I do not share your sentiments in regard to New York; butwhatever its faults, New York is the place where I have establishedmyself and am known, and where the abilities which I possess can beutilized and will be appreciated soonest. Benham is twenty-five yearsbehind this city in all things which concern art and my professionallife, as you well know."Selma flushed. "On the contrary, I have reason to believe that Benhamhas made wonderful progress in the last five years. My friends therewrite that there are many new streets and beautiful buildings, and thatthe spirit of the place is enthusiastic and liberal, not luxurious andsneering. You never appreciated Benham at its true worth, Wilbur.""Perhaps not. But we chose New York.""Then you insist on remaining here?""I see no reason for sacrificing the fruits of the past five years--forpulling myself up by the roots and making a fresh start. From aprofessional point of view, I think it would be madness.""Not even to save our happiness?" Selma's eyes swam and her lipstrembled as she spoke. She felt very miserable, and she yearned with thedesire that her husband would clasp her in his arms in a vast embrace,and tell her that she was right and that he would go. She felt that ifhe did, the horror of the past would be wiped out and loving harmony berestored.Wilbur's lips trembled, too. He gazed at her for a moment withoutspeaking, in conflict with himself; then passing his hand across hisforehead, as though he would sweep away a misty spell from his eyes,said, "Be sensible, Selma. If we could be happy in Benham, we should behappy here.""Then you refuse?""For the present, yes.""And I must remain here to be insulted--and a nobody.""For God's sake, Selma, let us not renew that discussion. What you askis impossible at present, but I shall remember that it is your wish, andwhen I begin my work at Benham the circumstances and surroundings may besuch that I shall feel willing to move."Selma turned to the table and took up a book, dissatisfied, yet buoyedby a new hope. She did not observe the tired lines on her husband'sface--the weariness of a soul disappointed in its most preciousaspirations.Within the next month it happened that a terrible and unusual fatalitywas the occasion of the death of both Mrs. Parsons and her daughter.They were killed by a fall of the elevator at the hotel in which theywere living--one of those dire casualties which are liable to happen toany one of us in these days of swift and complicated apparatus, butwhich always seem remote from personal experience. This cruel blow offate put an end to all desire on the part of the bereaved husband andfather to remain in New York, whither he had come to live mainly toplease his women folk, as he called them. As soon as he recovered fromthe bewilderment of the shock, Mr. Parsons sent for the architect whohad taken Littleton's place, and who had just begun the subservient taskof fusing diverse types of architecture in order to satisfy an Americanwoman's appetite for startling effect, and told him to arrange todispose of the lot and its immature walls to the highest bidder. Hisprecise plans for the future were still uncertain when Selma called onhim, and found comfort for her own miseries in ministering to hissolitude, but he expressed an inclination to return to his nativeWestern town, as the most congenial spot in which to end his days.Selma, whose soul was full of Benham, suggested it as an alternative,enlarging with contagious enthusiasm on its civic merits. The crushedold man listened with growing attention. Already the germs of a plan forthe disposition of his large property were sprouting in his mind toprovide him with a refuge from despondency. He was a reticent man, notin the habit of confiding his affairs until ready to act, but he paidinterested heed to Selma's eulogy of the bustling energy and rapidgrowth of Benham. His preliminary thought had been that it would makehim happy to endow his native town, which was a small and inconspicuousplace, with a library building. But, as his visitor referred to theattractions and admirable public spirit of the thriving city, which wasin the same State as his own home, he silently reasoned that residencethere need not interfere with his original project, and that he mightfind a wide and more important field for his benefactions in a communityso representative of American ideas and principles.Selma's visits of condolence to Mr. Parsons were interrupted by theillness of her own husband. In reflecting, subsequently, she rememberedthat he had seemed weary and out of sorts for several days, but herconscious attention was invoked by his coming home early in theafternoon, suffering from a violent chill, and manifestly in a state ofphysical collapse. He went to bed at once; Selma brought blankets and ahot-water bottle, and Dr. George Page was sent for. Dr. Page was the oneof Littleton's friends whom Selma had unsuccessfully yearned to knowbetter. She had never been able to understand him exactly, but hefascinated her in spite of--perhaps because of--his bantering manner.She found difficulty in reconciling it with his reputation for hard workand masterly skill in his profession. She was constantly hoping toextract from him something worthy of his large, solid face, with itsfirm mouth and general expression of reserve force, but he seemed alwaysbent on talking nonsense in her society, and more than once thedisagreeable thought had occurred to her that he was laughing at her. Hehad come to the house after her marriage now and then, but during thepast year or two she had scarcely seen him. The last time when they hadmet, Selma had taxed him with his neglect of her.His reply had been characteristically elusive and unsatisfactory. "Iwill not attempt to frame excuses for my behavior, Mrs. Littleton, forno reason which I could offer would be a justification."But on the present occasion his greeting was grave and eager."Wilbur sick? I feared as much. I warned Pauline two months ago that hewas overworking, and only last week I told him that he would break downif he did not go away for a fortnight's rest.""I wish you had spoken to me."Selma noted with satisfaction that there was no raillery in his mannernow. He bent his gaze on her searchingly."Have you not noticed that he looked ill and tired?"She did not flinch. Why indeed should she? "A little. He tired himself,I think, over the designs for Wetmore College, which he did in additionto his other work. But since the award was made it has seemed to me thathe was looking better."She started to lead the way to Wilbur's room, but the doctor paused, andregarding her again fixedly, as though he had formed a resolution toferret the secrets of her soul, said laconically:"Is he happy?""Happy?" she echoed."Has he anything on his mind, I mean--anything except his work?""Nothing--that is," she added, looking up at her inquisitorwith bright, interested eyes, "nothing except that he is veryconscientious--over-conscientious I sometimes think." To be bandyingpsychological analyses with this able man was an edifying experiencedespite her concern for Wilbur."I see," he answered dryly, and for an instant there was a twinkle inhis eyes. Yet he added, "To make a correct diagnosis it is important toknow all the facts of the case.""Of course," she said solemnly, reassured in her belief that she wasbeing consulted and was taking part in the treatment of her husband'smalady.She accompanied Dr. Page to Wilbur's bed-side. He conversed in a cheerytone with his friend while he took his temperature and made what seemedto her a comparatively brief examination. Selma jumped to the conclusionthat there was nothing serious the matter. The moment they had left theroom, the doctor's manner changed, and he said with alert concern:"Your husband is very ill; he has pneumonia. I am going to send for anurse.""A nurse? I will nurse him myself, Dr. Page."It seemed to her the obvious thing to do. She spoke proudly, for itflashed into her mind that here was the opportunity to redeem thesituation with Wilbur. She would tend him devotedly and when he had beenrestored to health by her loving skill, perhaps he would appreciate herat her worth, and recognize that she had thwarted him only to help him.The doctor's brow darkened, and he said with an emphasis which wasalmost stern: "Mrs. Littleton, I do not wish to alarm you, but it isright that you should know that Wilbur's symptoms are grave. I hope tosave his life, but it can be saved only by trained skill and attendance.Inexperienced assistance, however devoted, would be of no use in a caselike this.""But I only wished to nurse him.""I know it; I understand perfectly. You supposed that anyone could dothat. At least that you could. I shall return in an hour at the latestwith a nurse who was trained for three years in a hospital to fit her tobattle for valuable lives."Selma flushed with annoyance. She felt that she was being ridiculed andtreated as though she were an incapable doll. She divined that by hisraillery he had been making fun of her, and forthwith her predilectionwas turned to resentment. Not nurse her husband? Did this brow-beatingdoctor realize that, as a girl, she had been the constant attendant ofher invalid father, and that more than once it had occurred to her thather true mission in life might be to become a nurse? Training? She wouldprove to him that she needed no further training. These were herthoughts, and she felt like crying, because he had humiliated her at atime like this. Yet she had let Dr. Page go without a word. She returnedto Wilbur and established herself beside his bed. He tried to smile ather coming."I think I shall be better to-morrow. It is only a heavy cold," he said,but already he found difficulty in speaking."I have come to nurse you. The blankets and hot-water bottle have madeyou warmer, haven't they? Nod; you mustn't talk.""Yes," he whispered huskily.She felt his forehead, and it was burning. She took his hand and saying,"Sh! You ought not to talk," held it in her own. Then there was silencesave for Wilbur's uneasy turning. It was plain that he was veryuncomfortable. She realized that he was growing worse, and though shechose to believe that the doctor had exaggerated the seriousness of thecase in order to affront her, the thought came that he might die. Shehad never considered such a possibility before. What should she do? Shewould be a widow without children and without means, for she knew thatWilbur had laid up little if anything. She would have to begin life overagain--a pathetic prospect, yet interesting. Even this conjecture ofsuch a dire result conjured up a variety of possible methods oflivelihood and occupation which sped through her mind.The return of Dr. Page with a nurse cut short these painful yetengrossing speculations. His offensive manner appeared to have exhausteditself, but he proceeded to install his companion in Wilbur's room.Selma would have liked to turn her out of the house, but realized thatshe could not run the risk of taking issue with him at a time when herhusband's life might be in danger. With an injured air yet in silenceshe beheld the deliberate yet swift preparations. Once or twice Dr. Pageasked her to procure for him some article or appliance likely to be inthe house, speaking with a crisp, business-like preoccupation whichvirtually ignored her existence, yet was free from offence. His soulevidently was absorbed by his patient, whom he observed with alertwatchfulness, issuing brief directions now and then to his white-capped,methodical, and noiseless assistant. Selma sat with her hands before herin a corner of the bed-room, practically ignored. The shadows deepenedand a maid announced dinner. Dr. Page looked at his watch."I shall pass the night here," he said."Is he worse?""The disease is making progress and must run its course. This is onlythe beginning. You should eat your dinner, for you will need yourstrength," he added with simple graciousness."But I am doing nothing," she blurted."If there is anything you can do I will let you know."Their eyes met. His were gray and steady, but kind. She felt that hechose to treat her like a child, yet that he was trying to beconsiderate. She was galled, but after all, he was the doctor, andWilbur had the utmost confidence in him, so she must submit. She ate herdinner, and when she returned preparations were being made for thenight. The nurse was to use a lounge at the foot of Wilbur's bed. Dr.Page asked permission to occupy the dressing-room adjoining, so as to bewithin easy call. He established himself there with a book, returning atshort intervals to look at his patient. Selma had resumed her seat. Itwas dark save for a night lamp. In the stillness the only sounds werethe ticking of the clock on the mantel-piece and Wilbur's laboredbreathing. It seemed as though he were struggling for his life. Whatshould she do if he died? Why was she debarred from tending him? It wascruel. Tears fell on her hand. She stared into the darkness, twistingher fingers, until at last, as though to show her independence, shestepped to the bed on tip-toe. Wilbur's eyes were open. He put out hishand, and, taking hers, touched it to his burning lips."Good-night, Selma," he murmured.She stooped and kissed his brow. "I am here beside you, Wilbur."A figure stood behind her. She turned, expecting to encounter thewhite-capped sentinel. It was Dr. Page. He touched her gently on thearm. "We must let him rest now. You can do no good. Won't you go tobed?""Oh, no. I shall sit with him all night.""Very well. But it is important that you should not speak to him," hesaid with another touch of emphasis.She resumed her seat and sat out the night, wide-awake and conscious ofeach movement on Wilbur's part. He was restless and moaning. Twice thenurse summoned the doctor, and two or three times he came to thebed-side of his own accord. She felt slighted, and once, when it seemedto her that Wilbur was in distress and anxious for something, sheforestalled the nurse."He wishes water," Selma said sternly, and she fetched a glass from thetable and let him drink.Dr. Page took breakfast with her. She was conscious that somehow hervigil had affected his estimate of her, for his speech was frank anddirect, as though he considered her now more fit to be treated withconfidence."He is very ill, but he is holding his own. If you will lie down for afew hours, I will call you to take Miss Barker's place while she rests."This was gratifying, and tended to assuage her bitterness. But thedoctor appeared to her anxious, and spent only a few minutes at table.He said as he rose,"Excuse me, but Pauline--does she know?""I will send her word."Selma would have been glad to dispense with the presence of hersister-in-law. Their relations had not been sympathetic since theepisode of Miss Bailey, and, though Pauline still dined at the houseonce a week, the intercourse between them had become reserved andperfunctory. She grudged sharing with her what might be Wilbur's lasthours. She grudged, too, permitting her to help to nurse him, especiallynow that her own capabilities were in the way of being recognized, forshe remembered Dr. Page's partiality for her. Still, she appreciatedthat she must let her know.Pauline arrived speedily, and Selma found herself sobbing in her arms.She was pleased by this rush of feeling on her own part, and, confirmedin her belief that her sister-in-law was cold because she did not breakdown, and, shrinking from her efforts to comfort her, she quicklyregained her self-control. Pauline seemed composed and cheerful, but theunceasing watchfulness and manifest tension of the doctor weredisconcerting, and as the afternoon shadows deepened, the two women satgrave and silent, appalled by the suspicion that Wilbur's condition waseminently critical. Yet Dr. Page volunteered to say to them presently:"If his heart holds out, I am hopeful that he will pull through."Dr. Page had given up all his duties for the sake of Wilbur. He neverleft the house, manifestly devoting, as shown by the unflagging,absorbed scrutiny with which he noted every symptom and change, thefullest measure of his professional skill and a heart-felt purpose tosave his friend's life if human brain or human concentration couldavail. And yet he stated to Pauline in Selma's hearing that, beyondkeeping up the patient's strength by stimulants, science was practicallyhelpless, and that all they could do was to wait.And so they sat, still and unemployed watchers, while day turned intodarkness. From time to time, by the night-lamp, Selma saw Paulinesmiling at her as though in defiance of whatever fate might have instore. Selma herself felt the inclination neither to smile nor to weep.She sat looking before her with her hands clasped, resenting thepowerlessness of the few remedies used, and impatient of the inactivityand relentless silence. Why did not the doctor adopt more stringentmeasures? Surely there was something to be done to enable Wilbur tocombat the disease. Dr. Page had the reputation of being a skilfulphysician, and, presumably, was doing his best; but was it not possible,was it not sensible, to suppose there was a different and better way oftreating pneumonia--a way which was as superior to the conventional andstereotyped method as the true American point of view was superior inother matters?It came over her as a conviction that if she were elsewhere--in Benham,for instance--her husband could be readily and brilliantly cured. Thisimpassive mode of treatment seemed to her of one piece with the entireLittleton surroundings, the culmination of which was Pauline smiling inthe face of death. She yearned to do something active and decided. Yet,how helpless she was! This arbitrary doctor was following his owndictates without a word to anyone, and without suspecting the existenceof wiser expedients.In a moment of rebellion she rose, and swiftly approaching Wilbur's bed,exclaimed, fervently: "Is there not something we can do for you,darling? Something you feel will do you good?"The sufferer faintly smiled and feebly shook his head, and at the samemoment she was drawn away by a firm hand, and Dr. Page whispered: "He isvery weak. Entire rest is his only chance. The least exertion is a drainon his vitality.""Surely there must be some medicine--some powerful application whichwill help his breathing," she retorted, and she detected again thesemblance of laughter in the doctor's eyes."Everything which modern science can do is being done, Mrs. Littleton."What was there but to resume her seat and helpless vigil? Modernscience? The word grated on her ears. It savored to her of narrowmedical tyranny, and distrust of aspiring individuality. Wilbur wasdying, and all modern science saw fit to do was to give him brandy andwait. And she, his wife--the one who loved him best in the world, waspowerless to intervene. Nay, she had intervened, and modern science hadmocked her.Selma's eyes, like the glint of two swords, bent themselves on herhusband's bed. A righteous anger reinforced her grieving heart and madeher spirit militant, while the creeping hours passed. Over and over shepursued the tenor of her protest until her wearied system sought refugein sleep. She was not conscious of slumbering, but she reasoned laterthat she must have slept, for she suddenly became conscious of a touchon the shoulder and a vibrant utterance of her name."Selma, Selma, you must come at once."Her returning wits realized that it was Pauline who was arousing her andurging her to Wilbur's bed-side. She sprang forward, and saw the lightof existence fading from her husband's eyes into the mute dulness ofdeath. Dr. Page was bending over him in a desperate, but vain, effort toforce some restorative between his lips. At the foot of the bed stoodthe nurse, with an expression which betrayed what had occurred."What is it, Wilbur? What have they done to you? What has happened?"Selma cried, looking from one to the other, though she had discerned thetruth in a flash. As she spoke, Dr. Page desisted from his undertaking,and stepped back from the bed, and instantly Selma threw herself on herknees and pressed her face upon Littleton's lifeless features. There wasno response. His spirit had departed."His heart could not stand the strain. That is the great peril inpneumonia," she heard the doctor murmur."He is dead," she cried, in a horrified outburst, and she looked up atthe pitying group with the gaze of an afflicted lioness. She caughtsight of Pauline smiling through her tears--that same unprotesting,submissive smile--and holding out her hands to her. Selma, rising,turned away, and as her sister-in-law sought to put her arm about her,evaded the caress."No--no," she said. Then facing her, added, with aggrieved conviction:"I cannot believe that Wilbur's death was necessary. Why was notsomething energetic done?"Pauline flushed, but, ascribing the calumny to distress, she held herpeace, and said, simply:"Sh! dear. You will understand better by and by."BOOK III.THE SUCCESSCHAPTER I.It had never occurred to Selma that she might lose her husband. Evenwith his shortcomings he was so important to her from the point of viewof support, and her scheme of life was so interwoven with his, she hadtaken for granted that he would live as long as she desired. She feltthat destiny had a second time been signally cruel to her, and that shewas drinking deeply of the cup of sorrow. She was convinced that Wilbur,had he lived, would have moved presently to Benham, in accordance withher desire, and that they would then have been completely happy again.Instead he was dead and under the sod, and she was left to face theworld with no means save 5,000 from his life insurance and the naturalgifts and soul which God had given her.She appreciated that she was still a comparatively young woman, andthat, notwithstanding her love for Wilbur, she had been unable as hiswife to exhibit herself to the world in her true light. She was freeonce more to lead her own life, and to obtain due recognition for herideas and principles. She deplored with a grief which depleted the curveof her oval cheeks the premature end of her husband's artisticcareer--an aspiring soul cut off on the threshold of success--yet,though of course she never squarely made the reflection, she was awarethat the development of her own life was more intrinsically valuable tothe world than his, and that of the two it was best that he should betaken. She was sad, sore against Providence, and uncertain as to thefuture. But she was keenly conscious that she had a future, and she waseager to be stirring. Still, for the moment, the outlook was perplexing.What was she to do? First, and certainly, she desired to shake the dustof New York from her feet at the earliest opportunity. She inclinedtoward Benham as a residence, and to the lecture platform, supplementedby literature, and perhaps eventually the stage, as a means oflivelihood. She believed in her secret soul that she could act. Hersupposed facility in acquiring the New York manner had helped togenerate that impression. It seemed to her more than probable that witha little instruction as to technical stage business she could gain fameand fortune almost at once as an actress of tragedy or melodrama. Comedyshe despised as unworthy of her. But the stage appealed to her only onthe ground of income. The life of an actress lacked the ethicalcharacter which she liked to associate with whatever she did. To besure, a great actress was an inspiring influence. Nevertheless shepreferred some more obviously improving occupation, provided it wouldafford a suitable support. Yet was it fitting that she should becondemned to do hack work for her daily bread instead of something toenlighten and uplift the community in which she lived? She consideredthat she had served her apprenticeship by teaching school and writingfor the newspapers, and she begrudged spending further time insubordinate work. Better on the whole a striking success on the stagethan this, for after she had made a name and money she could retire anddevote herself to more congenial undertakings. Nevertheless herconscience told her that a theatrical career must be regarded as a lastresort, and she appreciated the importance of not making a hastydecision as to what she would do. The lease of her house would notexpire for six months, and it seemed to her probable that even in NewYork, where she was not understood, someone would realize her value as amanager of some intellectual or literary movement and make overtures toher. She wrote to Mrs. Earle and received a cordial response declaringthat Benham would welcome her with open arms, a complimentary thoughsomewhat vague certificate. She sent a line also to Mr. Dennison,informing him that she hoped soon to submit some short stories for hismagazine, and received a guarded but polite reply to the effect that hewould be glad to read her manuscripts.While she was thus deliberating and winding up her husband's affairs,Mr. Parsons, who had been absent from New York at the time of Wilbur'sdecease, called and bluntly made the announcement that he had bought ahouse in Benham, was to move there immediately, and was desirous thatshe should live with him as his companion and housekeeper on liberalpecuniary terms."I am an old man," he said, "and my health is not what it used to be. Ineed someone to look after me and to keep me company. I like your chattyways, and, if I have someone smart and brisk around like you, I sha'n'tbe thinking so often that I'm all alone in the world. It'll be dull foryou, I guess; but you'll be keeping quiet for the present wherever youare; and when the time comes that you wish to take notice again I won'tstand in the way of your amusing yourself."To this homely plea Selma returned a beatific smile. It struck her as anideal arrangement; a golden opportunity for him, and convenient andpromising for her. In the first place she was accorded the mission ofcheering and guarding the declining years of this fine old man, whom shehad come to look on with esteem and liking. And at the same time as hiscompanion--the virtual mistress of his house, for she knew perfectlywell that as a genuine American he was not offering her a position lessthan this--she would be able to shape her life gradually along congeniallines, and to wait for the ripe occasion for usefulness to presentitself. In an instant a great load was lifted from her spirit. She wasthankful to be spared conscientious qualms concerning the career of anactress, and thankful to be freed at one bound from her New Yorkassociations--especially with Pauline, whose attitude toward her hadbeen further strained by her continued conviction that Wilbur's lifemight have been saved. Indeed, so completely alleviating was Mr.Parsons's proposition that, stimulated by the thought that he was to bea greater gainer from the plan than she, Selma gave rein to her emotionsby exclaiming with fervor:"Usually I like to think important plans over before coming to adecision; but this arrangement seems to me so sensible and natural andmutually advantageous, Mr. Parsons, that I see no reason why I shouldn'taccept your offer now. God grant that I may be a worthy daughter toyou--and in some measure take the place of the dear ones you have lost.""That's what I want," he said. "I took a liking to you the first time wemet. Then it's settled?""Yes. I suppose," she added, after a moment's hesitation--speaking withan accent of scorn--"I suppose there may be people--people like thosewho are called fashionable here--who will criticise the arrangement onthe ground--er--of propriety, because I'm not a relation, and you arenot very old. But I despise conventions such as that. They may benecessary for foreigners; but they are not meant for self-respectingAmerican women. I fancy my sister-in-law may not wholly approve of it,but I don't know. I shall take pleasure in showing her and the rest thatit would be wicked as well as foolish to let a flimsy suggestion of evilinterfere with the happiness of two people situated as we are."Mr. Parsons seemed puzzled at first, as though he did not understandexactly what she meant, but when she concluded he said:"You come to me, as you have yourself stated, on the footing of adaughter. If folk are not content to mind their own business, I guess weneedn't worry because they don't happen to be suited. There's one or tworelations of mine would be glad to be in your shoes, but I don't know ofanything in the Bible or the Constitution of the United States whichforbids an old man from choosing the face he'll have opposite to him attable.""Or forbids the interchange of true sympathy--that priceless privilege,"answered Selma, her liking for a sententious speech rising paramounteven to the pleasure caused her by the allusion to her personalappearance. Nevertheless it was agreeable to be preferred to his femalecousins on the score of comeliness.Accordingly, within six months of her husband's death, the transition toBenham was accomplished, and Selma was able to encounter themetaphorically open arms, referred to by Mrs. Earle, without feelingthat she was a less important person than when she had been whisked offas a bride by Littleton, the rising architect. She was returning as theconfidential, protecting companion of a successful, self-made old man,who was relying on her to make his new establishment a pleasure tohimself and a credit to the wide-awake city in which he had elected topass his remaining days. She was returning to a house on the River Drive(the aristocratic boulevard of Benham, where the river Nye makes a broadsweep to the south); a house not far distant from the Flagg mansion atwhich, as Mrs. Lewis Babcock, she had looked askance as a monumentinimical to democratic simplicity. Wilbur had taught her that it wasvery ugly, and now that she saw it again after a lapse of years she waspleased to note that her new residence, though slightly smaller, had amore modern and distinguished air.The new house was of rough-hewn red sandstone, combining solid dignityand some artistic merit, for Benham had not stood still architecturallyspeaking. The River Drive was a grotesque, yet on the whole encouragingexhibit. Most of the residences had been designed by native talent, butunder the spur of experiment even the plain, hard-headed builders hadbeen constrained to dub themselves "architects," and adopt modernmethods; and here and there stood evidences that the seed planted byMrs. Hallett Taylor and Littleton had borne fruit, for Benham possessedat least half a dozen private houses which could defy criticism.The one selected by Mr. Parsons was not of these half dozen; but theplain, hard-headed builder who had erected it for the original owner wasshrewd and imitative, and had avoided ambitious deviations from the typehe wished to copy--the red sandstone, swell front variety, which tenyears before would have seemed to the moral sense of Benham undulycheerful. Mr. Parsons was so fortunate as to be able to buy it justafter it had been completed, together with a stable and half an acre ofground, from one of the few Benhamites whose financial ventures hadended in disaster, and who was obliged to sell. It was a more ambitiousresidence than Mr. Parsons had desired, but it was the most available,inasmuch as he could occupy it at once. It had been painted anddecorated within, but was unfurnished. Mr. Parsons, as a practicalbusiness man, engaged the builder to select and supply the bedroom andsolid fittings, but it occurred to him to invite Selma to choose thefurnishings for what he called the show rooms.Selma was delighted to visit once more the New York stores, free fromthe bridle of Wilbur's criticism and unrestrained by economy. She foundto her satisfaction that the internal decoration of the new house wasnot unlike that of the Williamses' first habitation--that is, gay andbedizened; and she was resolved in the selection of her draperies andornaments to buy things which suggested by their looks that they werehandsome, and whose claim to distinction was not mere soberunobtrusiveness. She realized that some of her purchases would have madeWilbur squirm, but since his death she felt more sure than ever thateven where art was concerned his taste was subdued, timid, andunimaginative. For instance, she believed that he would not haveapproved her choice of light-blue satin for the upholstery of thedrawing-room, nor of a marble statue--an allegorical figure of Truth,duly draped, as its most conspicuous ornament.Selma was spared the embarrassment of her first husband's presence.Divorce is no bar to ordinary feminine curiosity as to the whereaboutsof a former partner for life, and she had proved no exception to therule. Mrs. Earle had kept her posted as to Babcock's career since theirseparation, and what she learned had tended merely to demonstrate thewisdom and justice of her action. As a divorced man he had, after atime, resumed the free and easy, coarse companionship to which he hadbeen partial before his marriage, and had gradually become a heavydrinker. Presently he had neglected his business, a misfortune of whicha rival concern had been quick to take advantage. The trend of hisaffairs had been steadily downhill, and had come to a crisis threemonths before Littleton's death, when, in order to avoid insolvency, hesold out his factory and business to the rival company, and accepted atthe same hands the position of manager in a branch office in a cityfurther west. Consequently, Selma could feel free from molestation or anappeal to her sensibilities. She preferred to think of Babcock ascompletely outside her life, as dead to her, and she would have dislikedthe possibility of meeting him in the flesh while shopping on Centralavenue. It had been the only drawback to her proposed return to Benham.During the years of Selma's second marriage Benham had waxed rapidly inpopulation and importance. People had been attracted thither by thevaried industries of the city--alike those in search of fortune, andthose offering themselves for employment in the mills, oil-works, andpork factories; and at the date of Littleton's death it boasted over onehundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. It was already the second cityof the State in point of population, and was freely acknowledged to bethe most wide-awake and enterprising. The civic spirit of Benham wasreputed to be constantly and increasingly alert and progressive,notwithstanding the river Nye still ran the color of bean-soup abovewhere it was drawn for drinking purposes, and the ability of a plumber,who had become an alderman, to provide a statue or lay out a public parkwas still unquestioned by the majority. Even to-day, when trainedability has obtained recognition in many quarters, the Benhamites atlarge are apt to resent criticism as aristocratic fault-finding; yet atthis time that saving minority of souls who refused to regard everythingwhich Benham did as perfection, and whose subsequent forlorn hopes anddesperately won victories have little by little taught the communitywisdom, if not modesty, was beginning to utter disagreeable strictures.Mrs. Margaret Rodney Earle, when she opened her arms to Selma and foldedher to her bosom with a hug of welcome, was raging inwardly against thisminority, and they had not been many minutes together before she gaveutterance to her grievance."You have come just in time to give us your sympathy and support in animportant matter, my dear. Miss Bailey has been nominated for the SchoolBoard at the instance of the Executive Committee of the BenhamInstitute. We supposed that she would have plain sailing, for many ofthe voters have begun to recognize the justice of having one or twowomen on the School Board, and by hard work we had succeeded in gettingher name put on the Democratic ticket. Judge, then, of our feelings whenwe learned that the Reform Club had decided to blacklist and refuse tosupport at the polls three of the six names on the ticket, including ourLuella Bailey, on the ground of lack of experience in educationalmatters. The Reform Club has nominated three other persons--one of thema woman. And who do you suppose is the head and front of this unholycrusade?""It sounds like Mrs. Hallett Taylor," answered Selma, sternly."How did you know? What made you think so? How clever of you, Selma!Yes, she is the active spirit.""It was she who was at the bottom of Miss Bailey's rejection when shewas my candidate for a position at Everdean College.""To be sure. I remember. This Reform Club, which was started a year orso ago, and which sets itself up as a censor of what we are trying to doin Benham, has nominated a Miss Snow, who is said to have travelledabroad studying the school systems of Europe.""As if that would help us in any way.""Precisely. She has probably come home with her head full ofqueer-fangled notions which would be out of keeping with ourinstitutions. Just the reason why she shouldn't be chosen. We aregreatly troubled as to the result, dear, for though we expect to win,the prejudice of some men against voting for a woman under anycircumstances will operate against our candidate, so that this action ofthe Reform Club may possibly be the means of electing one of the men onthe Republican ticket instead of Luella. Miss Snow hasn't the ghost of achance. But that isn't all. These Reform Club nominations arepreliminary to a bill before the Legislature to take away from thepeople the right to elect members of the school committee, andsubstitute an appointive board of specialists to serve during long termsof good behavior. As Mr. Lyons says, that's the real issue involved.It's quixotic and it isn't necessary. Haven't we always prided ourselveson our ability to keep our public schools the best in the world? And isthere any doubt, Selma, that either you or I would be fully qualified toserve on the School Board though we haven't made any special study ofprimers and geographies? Luella Bailey hasn't had any special training,but she's smart and progressive, and the poor thing would like therecognition. We fixed on her because we thought it would help her to getahead, for she has not been lucky in obtaining suitable employment. AsMr. Lyons says, a serious principle is involved. He has come out strongagainst the movement and declares that it is a direct menace to theintelligence of the plain people of the United States and a subtleinvasion of their liberties.""Mr. Lyons? What Mr. Lyons is that?""Yes, dear, it is the same one who managed your affair. Your Mr. Lyons.He has become an important man since you left Benham. He speaksdelightfully, and is likely to receive the next Democratic nominationfor Congress. He is in accord with all liberal movements, and a foe ofeverything exclusive, unchristian or arbitrary. He has declared hisintention to oppose the bill when it is introduced, and I shall devotemyself body and soul to working against it in case Luella Bailey isdefeated. It is awkward because Mrs. Taylor is a member of theInstitute, though she doesn't often come, and the club has never been inpolitics. But here when there was a chance to do Luella Bailey a goodturn, and I'd been able through some of my newspaper friends to get heron the ticket, it seems to me positively unchristian--yes, that's theword--to try to keep her off the board. There are some things of course,Luella couldn't do--and if the position were superintendent of ahospital, for instance, I dare say that special training would beadvantageous, though nursing can be picked up very rapidly by a keenintelligence: but to raise such objections in regard to a candidate forthe School Board seems to me ridiculous as well as cruel. Whatwe need there are open, receptive minds, free from fads andprejudice--wide-awake, progressive enthusiastic intellects. It worriesme to see the Institute dragged into politics, but it is my duty toresist this undemocratic movement.""Surely," exclaimed Selma, with fire. "I am thankful I have come in timeto help you. I understand exactly. I have been passing through just suchexperiences in New York--encountering and being rebuffed by just suchpeople as those who belong to this Reform Club. My husband was beginningto see through them and to recognize that we were both tied hand andfoot by their narrowness and lack of enthusiasm when he died. If he hadlived, we would have moved to Benham shortly in order to escape frombondage. And one thing is certain, dear Mrs. Earle," she continued withintensity, "we must not permit this carping spirit of hostility tooriginal and spontaneous effort to get a foothold in Benham. We mustcrush it, we must stamp it out.""Amen, my dear. I am delighted to hear you talk like that. I declare youwould be very effective in public if you were roused.""Yes, I am roused, and I am willing to speak in public if it becomesnecessary in order to keep Benham uncontaminated by the insidious cankerof exclusiveness and the distrust of aspiring souls which a few narrowminds choose to term untrained. Am _I_ untrained? Am _I_ superficial andcommon? Do _I_ lack the appearance and behavior of a lady?"Selma accompanied these interrogatories with successive waves of thehand, as though she were branding so many falsehoods."Assuredly not, Selma. I consider you"--and here Mrs. Earle gasped inthe process of choosing her words--"I consider you one of our besttrained and most independent minds--cultured, a friend of culture, andan earnest seeker after truth. If you are not a lady, neither am I,neither is anyone in Benham. Why do you ask, dear?" And without waitingfor an answer, Mrs. Earle added with a touch of material wisdom, "Youreturn to Benham under satisfactory, I might say, brilliant auspices.You will be the active spirit in this fine house, and be in a positionto promote worthy intellectual and moral movements.""Thank heavens, yes. And to combat those which are unworthy anddangerous," exclaimed Selma, clasping her fingers, "I can count on thesupport of Mr. Parsons, God bless him! And it would seem at last as if Ihad, a real chance--a real chance at last. Mrs. Earle--Cora--I know youcan keep a secret. I feel almost as though you were my mother, for thereis no one else now to whom I can talk like this. I have not been happyin New York. I thought I was happy at first, but lately we have beenmiserable. My marriage--er--they drove my husband to the wall, andkilled him. He was sensitive and noble, but not practical, and he fell avictim to the mercenary despotism of our surroundings. When I tried tohelp him they became jealous of me, and shut their doors in our faces.""You poor, poor child. I have suspected for some time that something waswrong.""It nearly killed me. But now, thank heaven, I breathe freely once more.I have lost my dear husband, but I have escaped from that prison-house;and with his memory to keep me merciless, I am eager to wage war againstthose influences which are conspiring to fetter the free-born soul andstifle spontaneity. Luella Bailey must be elected, and these people betaught that foreign ideas may flourish in New York, but cannot obtainroot in Benham."Mrs. Earle wiped her eyes, which were running over as the result of thiscombination of confidence and eloquence."If you don't mind my saying so, Selma, I never saw anyone so muchimproved as you. You always had ideas, and were well equipped, but nowyou speak as though you could remove mountains if necessary. It's ablessing for us as well as you that you're back among us once more."CHAPTER II.When Selma uttered her edict that Luella Bailey must be elected she didnot know that the election was only three days off. When she was toldthis by Mrs. Earle, she cast about feverishly during a few hours for themeans to compass certain victory, then promptly and sensibly disclaimedresponsibility for the result, suggesting even that her first appearanceas a remover of mountains be deferred to the time when the bill shouldbe before the Legislature. As she aptly explained to Mrs. Earle, thecanvass was virtually at an end, she was unacquainted with the practicalfeatures of the situation, and was to all intents a stranger in Benhamafter so long an absence. Mrs. Earle was unable to combat the logic ofthese representations, but she obtained from Selma a ready promise toaccompany the Benham Institute to the final rally on the evening beforeelection day and sit in a prominent place on the platform. The Institutewas to attend as a body by way of promoting the cause of its candidate,for though the meeting was called in aid of the entire Democraticmunicipal ticket, Hon. James O. Lyons, the leading orator of theoccasion, had promised to devote special attention to Miss Bailey, whoseelection, owing to the attitude of the Reform Club, was recognized as indoubt. Selma also agreed to accompany Mrs. Earle in a hack on the dayitself, and career through the city in search of recalcitrant orindifferent female voters, for the recently acquired right of Benhamwomen to vote for members of the School Board had not as yet beenexercised by any considerable number of the emancipated sex.As a part of the programme of the meeting the Benham Institute, or themajor portion of it (for there were a few who sympathized openly withMrs. Taylor), filed showily on to the platform headed by Mrs. Earle, whowaved her pocket handkerchief at the audience, which was the occasionfor renewed hand-clapping and enthusiasm. Selma walked not far behindand took her seat among the forty other members, who all wore white silkbadges stamped in red with the sentiment "A vote for Luella Bailey is avote for the liberty of the people." Her pulses were throbbing withinterest and pleasure. This was the sort of thing she delighted in, andwhich she had hoped would be a frequent incident of her life in NewYork. It pleased her to think how naturally and easily she had taken herplace in the ranks of these earnest, enthusiastic workers, and that shehad merely to express a wish in order to have leadership urged upon her.Matters had shaped themselves exactly as she desired. Mr. Parsons notonly treated her completely as an equal, but consulted her in regard toeverything. He had already become obviously dependent on her, and hadbegun to develop the tendencies of an invalid.The exercises were of a partisan cast. The theory that municipalgovernment should be independent of party politics had been an adage inBenham since its foundation, and been disregarded annually bynine-tenths of the population ever since. This was a Democraticlove-feast. The speakers and the audience alike were in the best ofspirits, for there was no uncertainty in the minds of the party prophetsas to the result of the morrow's ballot--excepting with regard to MissBailey. The rest of the ticket would unquestionably be elected;accordingly all hands and voices were free to focus their energies inher behalf and thus make the victory a clean sweep. Nevertheless theearlier speakers felt obliged to let their eloquence flow over the wholerange of political misgovernment from the White House and the nationalplatform down, although the actual issue was the choice of a mayor,twelve aldermen and a school committee, so that only casual referencewas made to the single weak spot on the ticket until the Hon. James O.Lyons rose to address the meeting. The reception accorded him was morespontaneous and effusive than that which had been bestowed on either ofhis predecessors, and as he stood waiting with dignified urbanity forthe applause to subside, some rapturous admirer called for three cheers,and the tumult was renewed.Selma was thrilled. Her acquaintance with Mr. Lyons naturally heightenedher interest, and she observed him eagerly. Time had added to hiscorporeal weight since he had acted as her counsel, and enhanced thesober yet genial decorum of his bearing. His slightly pontifical airseemed an assurance against ill-timed levity. His cheeks were still fatand smooth shaven, but, like many of the successful men of Benham, henow wore a chin beard--a thick tuft of hair which in his case tapered sothat it bore some resemblance to the beard of a goat, and gave arough-and-ready aspect to his appearance suggestive alike of smart,solid worth and an absence of dandified tendencies. Mr. Parsons had athicker beard of the same character, which Selma regarded with favor asa badge of serious intentions."My friends," he began when the applause had subsided; then paused andsurveyed his audience in a manner which left them in doubt as to whetherhe was struggling with emotion or busy in silent prayer. "My friends, amonth ago to-day the citizens of Benham assembled to crown withappropriate and beautiful services the monument which they, thesurvivors, have erected with pious hands to perpetuate the memory ofthose who laid down their lives to keep intact our beloved union ofStates and to banish slavery forever from the confines of our aspiringcivilization. A week ago an equally representative assembly, withoutregard to creed or party, listened to the exercises attending thededication of the new Court House which we have raised to Justice--thatwhite-robed goddess, the guardian of the liberties of the people. Eachwas a notable and significant event. On each occasion I had the honor tosay a few poor words. We celebrated with bowed heads and with garlandsthe deeds of the heroic dead, and now have consecrated ourselves to theopportunities and possibilities of peace under the law--to therevelation of the temper of our new civilization which, tried in thefurnace of war, is to be a grand and vital power for the advancement ofthe human race, for the righteous furtherance of the brotherhood of man.What is the hope of the world?" he asked. "America--these United States,a bulwark against tyranny, an asylum for the aspiring and thedowntrodden. The eyes of the nations are upon us. In the souls of thesurvivors and of the sons and daughters of the patriots who have died indefence of the liberties of our beloved country abide the seed andinspiration for new victories of peace. Our privilege be it as the heirsof Washington and Franklin and Hamilton and Lincoln and Grant to set thenations of the earth an example of what peace under the law mayaccomplish, so that the free-born son of America from the shores of CapeCod to the western limits of the Golden Gate may remain a synonym fornoble aims and noble deeds, for truth and patriotism and fearlessness ofsoul."The speaker's words had been uttered slowly at the outset--ponderous,sonorous, sentence by sentence, like the big drops before a heavyshower. As he warmed to his theme the pauses ceased, and his speechflowed with the musical sweep of a master of platform oratory. When hespoke of war his voice choked; in speaking of peace he paused for anappreciable moment, casting his eyes up as though he could discern theangel of national tranquillity hovering overhead. Although this openingperoration seemed scarcely germane to the occasion, the audiencelistened in absorbed silence, spell-bound by the magnetism of hisdelivery. They felt sure that he had a point in reserve to which thesesplendid and agreeable truths were a pertinent introduction.Proceeding, with his address, Mr. Lyons made a panegyric on these UnitedStates of America, from the special standpoint of their dedication tothe "God of our fathers," a solemn figure of speech. The sincerity ofhis patriotism was emphasized by the religious fervor of his deductionthat God was on the side of the nation, and the nation on the side ofGod. Though he abstained from direct strictures, both his manner and hismatter seemed to serve a caveat, so to speak, on the other nations bydeclaring that for fineness of heart and thought, and deed, the worldmust look to the land "whose wide and well-nigh boundless prairies wereblossoming with the buds of truth fanned by the breeze of liberty andfertilized by the aspirations of a God-fearing and a God-led population.What is the hope of the world, I repeat?" he continued. "The plain andsovereign people of our beloved country. Whatever menaces theirliberties, whatever detracts from their, power and infringes on theirprerogatives is a peril to our institutions and a step backward in thescience of government. My friends, we are here to-night to protestagainst a purpose to invade those liberties--a deliberately conceiveddesign to take away from the sovereign people of this city one of theircherished privileges--the right to decide who shall direct the policy ofour free public-school system, that priceless heritage of everyAmerican. I beg to remind you that this contest is no mere question ofhealthy rivalry between two great political parties; nor again is itonly a vigorous competition between two ambitious and intelligent women.A ballot in behalf of our candidate will be a vote of confidence in theability of the plain people of this country to adopt the besteducational methods without the patronizing dictation of aboard ofspecialists nurtured on foreign and uninspiring theories of instruction.A ballot against Miss Luella Bailey, the competent and cultivated ladywhose name adds strength and distinction to our ticket, and who has beenneedlessly and wantonly opposed by those who should be her proudfriends, will signify a willingness to renounce one of our most preciousliberties--the free man's right to choose those who are to impart to hischildren mastery of knowledge and love of country. I take my standto-night as the resolute enemy of this aristocratic and un-Americansuggestion, and urge you, on the eve of election, to devote yourenergies to overwhelming beneath the shower of your fearless ballotsthis insult to the intelligence of the voters of Benham, and this menaceto our free and successful institutions, which, under the guidance ofthe God of our fathers, we purpose to keep perpetually progressive andundefiled."A salvo of enthusiasm greeted Mr. Lyons as he concluded. His speecheswere apt to cause those whom he addressed to feel that they were nocommon campaign utterances, but eloquent expressions of principle andconviction, clothed in memorable language, as, indeed, they were. He wasfond of giving a moral or patriotic flavor to what he said in public,for he entertained both a profound reverence for high moral ideas and anabiding faith in the superiority of everything American. He had arrayedhimself on the threshold of his legal career as a friend and champion ofthe mass of the people--the plain and sovereign people, as he was apt tostyle them in public. His first and considerable successes had been asthe counsel for plaintiffs before juries in accident cases against largecorporations, and he had thought of himself with complete sincerity as aplain man, contesting for human rights before the bar of justice, by thesheer might of his sonorous voice and diligent brain. His politicaldevelopment had been on the same side. Latterly the situation had becomea little puzzling, though to a man of straightforward intentions, likehimself, not fundamentally embarrassing. That is, the last four or fiveyears had altered both the character of his practice and hiscircumstances, so that instead of fighting corporations he was now theclose adviser of a score of them; not the defender of their accidentcases, but the confidential attorney who was consulted in regard totheir vital interests, and who charged them liberal sums for hisservices. He still figured in court from time to time in his capacity ofthe plain man's friend, which he still considered himself to be no lessthan before, but most of his time was devoted to protecting the legalinterests of the railroad, gas, water, manufacturing, mining and otherundertakings which, the rapid growth of Benham had forgotten. And as aresult of this commerce with the leading men of affairs in Benham, andknowledge of what was going on, he had been able to invest his largefees to the best advantage, and had already reaped a rich harvest fromthe rapid rise in value of the securities of diverse successfulenterprises. When new projects were under consideration he was in aposition to have a finger in the pie, and he was able to borrow freelyfrom a local bank in which he was a director.He was puzzled--it might be said distressed--how to make these rewardsof his professional prominence appear compatible with his real politicalprinciples, so that the plain and sovereign people would recognize asclearly as he that there was no inconsistency in his having takenadvantage of the opportunities for professional advancement thrown inhis way. He was ambitious for political preferment, sharing the growingimpression that he was well qualified for public office, and he desiredto rise as the champion of popular ideas. Consequently he resentedbitterly the calumnies which had appeared in one or two irresponsiblenewspapers to the effect that he was becoming a corporation attorney anda capitalist. Could a man refuse legitimate business which was thrustupon him? How were his convictions and interest in the cause ofstruggling humanity altered or affected by his success at the bar? Hencehe neglected no occasion to declare his allegiance to progressivedoctrine, and to give utterance to the patriotism which at all times wason tap in his emotional system. He had been married, but his wife hadbeen dead a number of years, and he made his home with his aged mother,to whom he was apt to refer with pious tremulousness when he desired toemphasize some domestic situation before a jury. As a staunch member ofthe Methodist Church, he was on terms of intimate association with hispastor, and was known as a liberal contributor to domestic and foreignmissions.Selma was genuinely carried away by the character of his oratory. Hissentiments were so completely in accord with her own ideas that she felthe had left nothing unsaid, and had put the case grandly. Here at lastwas a man who shared with her the convictions with which her brain wasseething--a man who was not afraid to give public expression to hisviews, and who possessed a splendid gift of statement. She had felt surethat she would meet sympathy and kindred spirits in Benham, but herexperience in New York had so far depressed her that she had not allowedherself to expect such a thorough-going champion. What a contrast hissolid, devotional, yet business-like aspect was to the quizzicallightness of the men in New York she had been told were clever, like Dr.Page and Mr. Dennison! He possessed Wilbur's ardor and reverence, with arobustness of physique and a practical air which Wilbur hadlacked--lacked to his and her detriment. If Wilbur had been as vigorousin body as he ought to have been, would he have died? She had readsomewhere lately that physical delicacy was apt to react on the mind andmake one's ideas too fine-spun and unsubstantial. Here was the advantagewhich a man like Mr. Lyons had over Wilbur. He was strong and thickset,and looked as though he could endure hard work without wincing. So couldshe. It was a great boon, an essential of effective manhood orwomanhood. These thoughts followed in the wake of the enthusiasm hispersonality had aroused in her at the close of his address. She scarcelyheard the remarks of the next speaker, the last on the programme. Hereyes kept straying wistfully in the direction of Mr. Lyons, and shewondered if there would be an opportunity when the meeting was over tolet him know how much she approved of what he had said, and hownecessary she felt the promulgation, of such ideas was for the welfareof the country.She was aroused from contemplation by the voice of Mrs. Earle, who, nowthat everybody was standing up preliminary to departure, bent over herfront bench on the platform to whisper, "Wasn't Mr. Lyons splendid?""Yes, indeed," said Selma. "I should like so much to make hisacquaintance, to compare notes with him and thank him for his brave,true words.""I know he'd be pleased to meet you. I'll try to catch his eye. I wishsome of those Reform Club people could have heard what he thought ofthem. There! He's looking this way. I'm going to attract his attention."Whereupon Mrs. Earle began to nod in his direction energetically. "Hesees us now, and has noticed you. I shouldn't wonder if he hasrecognized you. Follow me close, Selma, and we'll be able to shake handswith him."By dint of squeezing and stertorous declarations of her desire, Mrs.Earle obtained a gradual passage through the crowd. Many from theaudience had ascended to the platform for the purpose of accosting thespeakers, and a large share of the interest was being bestowed on Mr.Lyons, who was holding an impromptu reception. When at last Mrs. Earlehad worked her way to within a few feet of him, her wheezing conditionand bulk announced her approach, and procured her consideration from theothers in the line, so that she was able to plant herself pervasivelyand firmly in front of her idol and take possession of him by the fervidannouncement, "You were simply unanswerable. Eloquent, convincing, andunanswerable. And I have brought with me an old friend, Mrs. Littleton,who sympathizes with your superb utterances, and wishes to tell you so."As Selma stepped forward in recognition of this introduction shevibrated to hear Mr. Lyons say, without a sign of hesitation, "A friendwhom it is a pleasure to welcome back to Benham, Mrs. Littleton, I ampleased to meet you again."Selma had hoped, and felt it her due, that he would recognize her. Stillhis having done so at once was a compliment which served to enhance thefavorable opinion which she had already formed regarding him."I have been longing for months, Mr. Lyons," she said, "to hear someonesay what you have said to-night. I am concerned, as we all are ofcourse, in Miss Bailey's election, and your advocacy of her cause wasmost brilliant; but what I refer to--what interested, me especially, wasthe splendid protest you uttered against all movements to prevent theintelligence of the people from asserting itself. It gave meencouragement and made me feel that the outlook for the future isbright--that our truths must prevail."It was a maxim with Lyons that it was desirable to remember everyone hemet, and he prided himself on his ability to call cordially by nameclients or chance acquaintances whom he had not seen for years. Naturehad endowed him with a good memory for names and faces, but he hadlearned to take advantage of all opportunities to brush up his witsbefore they were called into flattering, spontaneous action. When hisglance, attracted by Mrs. Earle's remote gesticulation, rested onSelma's face, he began to ask himself at once where he had seen itbefore. In the interval vouchsafed by her approach he recalled theincident of the divorce, that her name had been Babcock, and that shehad married again, but he was still groping for the name of her husbandwhen the necessary clew was supplied by Mrs. Earle, and he was able tomake his recognition of her exhaustive. He noticed with approval herpretty face and compact figure, reflecting that the slight gain in fleshwas to her advantage, and noticed also her widow's mourning. But hereager, fluent address and zealous manner had prevented his attentionfrom secretly wandering with business-like foresight to the next personsin the line of those anxious to shake his hand, and led him to regardher a second time. He was accustomed to compliments, but he was struckby the note of discriminating companionship in her congratulation. Hebelieved that he had much at heart the very issue which she had touchedupon, and it gratified him that a woman whose appearance was soattractive to him should single out for sympathetic enthusiasm what wasin his opinion the cardinal principle involved, instead of expatiatingon the assistance he had rendered Miss Bailey. Lyons said to himselfthat here was a kindred spirit--a woman with whom conversation would bea pleasure; with whom it would be possible to discourse on terms ofmental comradeship. He was partial to comely women, but he did notapprove of frivolity except on special and guarded occasions."I thank you cordially for your appreciation," he answered. "You havegrasped the vital kernel of my speech and I am grateful for your goodopinion."Even in addressing the other sex, Lyons could not forget theresponsibility of his frock-coat and that it was incumbent upon him tobe strictly serious in public. Nevertheless his august but glib demeanorsuited Selma's mood better than more obvious gallantry, especially asshe got the impression, which he really wished to convey, that headmired her. It was out of the question for him to prolong the situationin the face of those waiting to grasp his hand, but Lyons heard withinterest the statement which Mrs. Earle managed to whisper hoarsely inhis ear just as he turned to welcome the next comer, and they were sweptalong:"She is one of our brightest minds. The poor child has recently lost herhusband, and has come to keep Mr. Parsons company in his new house--anideal arrangement."The identity of Mr. Parsons was well known to Lyons. He had met himoccasionally in the past in other parts of the State in connection withbusiness complications, and regarded him as a practical, intelligentcitizen whose name would be of value to an aspirant for Congressionalhonors. It occurred to him as he shook hands with those next in line andaddressed them that it would be eminently suitable if he should pay hisrespects to this new-comer to Benham by a visit. By so doing he worldkill two birds with one stone, for he had reasoned of late that he owedit to himself to see more of the other sex. He had no specificmatrimonial intentions; that is, he was not on the lookout for a wife;but he approved of happy unions as one of the great bulwarks of thecommunity, and was well-disposed to encounter a suitable helpmate. Heshould expect physical charms, dignity, capacity and a sympathetic mind;a woman, in short, who would be an ornament to his home, a Christianinfluence in society and a companion whose intelligent tact would belikely to promote his political fortunes. And so it happened that in thecourse of the next few days he found himself thinking of Mrs. Littletonas a fine figure of a woman. This had not happened to him before sincethe death of his wife, and it made him thoughtful to the extent ofasking "Why not?" For in spite of his long frock-coat and properdemeanor, passion was not extinct in the bosom of the Hon. James O.Lyons, and he was capable on special and guarded occasions of telling awoman that he loved her.CHAPTER III.Miss Luella Bailey was not elected. The unenlightened prejudice of manto prefer one of his own sex, combined with the hostility of the ReformClub, procured her defeat, notwithstanding that the rest of her tickettriumphed at the polls. There was some consolation for her friends inthe fact that her rival, Miss Snow, had a considerably smaller number ofvotes than she. Selma solaced herself by the reflection that, as she hadbeen consulted only at the twelfth hour, she was not responsible for theresult, but she felt nerved by the defeat to concentrate her energiesagainst the proposed bill for an appointed school board.Her immediate attention and sympathy were suddenly invoked by theillness of Mr. Parsons, who had seemed lacking in physical vigor forsome weeks, and whose symptoms culminated in a slight paralysis, whichconfined him to his bed for a month, and to his house during theremainder of the autumn. Selma rejoiced in this opportunity to developher capacities as a nurse, to prove how adequate she would have been totake complete charge of her late husband, had Dr. Page chosen to trusther. She administered with scrupulous regularity to the invalid suchmedicines as were ordered, and kept him cheerful by reading andconversation, so that the physician in charge complimented her on herproficiency. Trained nurses were unknown in Benham at this time, and anyold or unoccupied female was regarded as qualified to watch over thesick. Selma appreciated from what she had observed of the conduct ofWilbur's nurse that there was a wrong and a right way of doing things,but she blamed Dr. Page for his failure to appreciate instinctively thatshe was sure to do things suitably. It seemed to her that he had lackedthe intuitive gift to discern latent capabilities--a fault of which theBenham practitioner proved blameless.From the large, sunny chamber in which Mr. Parsons slowly recovered someportion of his vitality, Selma could discern the distant beginnings ofWetmore College, pleasantly situated on an elevation well beyond thecity limits on the further side of the winding river. An architect hadbeen engaged to carry out Wilbur's plans, and she watched the outlinesof the new building gradually take shape during the convalescence of herbenefactor. She recognized that the college would be theoretically anoble addition to the standing of Benham as a city of intellectual andaesthetic interests, but it provoked her to think that its management wasin the hands of Mrs. Hallett Taylor and her friends, between whom andherself she felt that a chasm of irreconcilable differences of opinionexisted. Mrs. Taylor had not called on her since her return. Shebelieved that she was glad of this, and hoped that some of the severelyindignant criticism which she had uttered in regard to the Reform Clubmovement had reached her ears. Or was Mrs. Taylor envious of her returnto Benham as the true mistress of this fine establishment on the RiverDrive, so superior to her own? Nevertheless, it would have suited Selmato have been one of the trustees of this new college--her husband'shandiwork in the doing of which he had laid down his promising life--andthe fact that no one had sought her out and offered her the honor as afitting recognition of her due was secretly mortifying. The BenhamInstitute had been prompt to acknowledge her presence by giving areception in her honor, at which she was able to recite once more, "Oh,why should the Spirit of Mortal be proud?" with old-time success, andshe had been informed by Mrs. Earle that she was likely to be chosen oneof the Vice-Presidents at the annual meeting. But these Reform Clubpeople had not even done her the courtesy to ask her to join them orconsider their opinions. She would have spurned the invitation withcontempt, but it piqued her not to know more about them; it distressedher to think that there should exist in Benham an exclusive set whichprofessed to be ethically and intellectually superior and did notinclude her, for she had come to Benham with the intention of leadingsuch a movement, to the detriment of fashion and frivolity. With Mr.Parsons's money at her back, she was serenely confident that the housesof the magnates of Benham--the people who corresponded in her mind's eyeto the dwellers on Fifth Avenue--would open to her. Already there hadbeen flattering indications that she would be able to command attentionthere. She had expected to find this so; her heart would have beenbroken to find it otherwise. Still, her hope in shaking the dust of NewYork from her feet had been to find in Benham an equally admirable andsatisfactory atmosphere in regard to mental and moral progress. She hadcome just in time, it is true, to utter her vehement protest againstthis exclusive, aristocratic movement--this arrogant affectation ofsuperiority, and to array herself in battle line against it, resolved togive herself up with enthusiasm to its annihilation. Yet the sight ofthe college buildings for the higher education of women, rising withouther furtherance and supervision, and under the direction of thesepeople, made her sad and gave her a feeling of disappointment. Why hadthey been permitted to obtain this foothold? Someone had been lacking invigilance and foresight. Thank heaven, with her return and a strong,popular spirit like Mr. Lyons in the lead, these unsympathetic,so-called reformers would speedily be confounded, and the intellectualair of Benham restored to its original purity.One afternoon while Selma's gaze happened to be directed toward theembryo college walls, and she was incubating on the situation, Mr.Parsons, who had seemed to be dozing, suddenly said:"I should like you to write to Mr. Lyons, the lawyer, and ask him tocome to see me.""I will write to-night. You know he called while you were ill.""Yes, I thought him a clever fellow when we met two or three times onrailroad matters, and I gather from what you told me about his speech atthe political meeting that he's a rising man hereabouts. I'm going tomake my will, and I need him to put it into proper shape.""I'm sure he'd do it correctly.""There's not much for him to do except to make sure that the language islegal, for I've thought it all out while I've been lying here duringthese weeks. Still, it's important to have in a lawyer to fix it so thepeople whom I don't intend to get my money shan't be able to make outthat I'm not in my right mind. I guess," he added, with a laugh, "thatthe doctor will allow I've my wits sufficiently for that?""Surely. You are practically well now."Mr. Parsons was silent for a moment. He prided himself on beingclose-mouthed about his private affairs until they were ripe forutterance. His intention had been to defer until after the interviewwith his lawyer any statement of his purpose, but it suddenly occurredto him that it would please him to unbosom his secret to his companionbecause he felt sure in advance that she would sympathize fully with hisplans. He had meant to tell her when the instrument was signed. Why notnow?"Selma," he said, "I've known ever since my wife and daughter died thatI ought to make a will, but I kept putting it off until it has almosthappened that everything I've got went to my next of kin--folk I'm fondof, too, and mean to remember--but not fond enough for that. If I givethem fifty thousand dollars apiece--the three of them--I shall rest easyin my grave, even if they think they ought to have had a bigger slice.It's hard on a man who has worked all his days, and laid up close to amillion of dollars, not to have a son or a daughter, flesh of my flesh,to leave it to; a boy or a girl given at the start the education Ididn't get, and who, by the help of my money, might make me proud, if Icould look on, of my name or my blood. It wasn't to be, and I must grinand bear it, and do the next best thing. I caught a glimpse of what thatthing was soon after I lost my wife and daughter, and it was the thoughtof that more than anything which kept me from going crazy with despair.I'm a plain man, an uneducated man, but the fortune I've made has beenmade honestly, and I'm going to spend it for the good of the Americanpeople--to contribute my mite toward helping the cause of truth and goodcitizenship and free and independent ideas which this nation calls for.I'm going to give my money for benevolent uses.""Oh, Mr. Parsons," exclaimed Selma, clasping her hands, "how splendid!how glorious! How I envy you. It was what I hoped.""I knew you would be pleased. I've had half a mind once or twice to letthe cat out of the bag, because I guessed it would be the sort of thingthat would take your fancy; but somehow I've kept mum, for fear I mightbe taken before I'd been able to make a will. And then, too, I've beenof several minds as to the form of my gift. I thought it would suit mebest of all to found a college, and I was disappointed when I learnedthat neighbor Flagg had got the start of me with his seminary for womenacross the river. I wasn't happy over it until one night, just after thedoctor had gone, the thought came to me, 'Why, not give a hospital?' Andthat's what it's to be. Five hundred thousand dollars for a freehospital in the City of Benham, in memory of my wife and daughter.That'll be useful, won't it? That'll help the people as much as acollege? And, Selma," he added, cutting off the assuring answer whichtrembled on her tongue and blazed from her eyes, "I shan't forget you.After I'm gone you are to have twenty thousand dollars. That'll enableyou, in case you don't marry, to keep a roof over your head withoutworking too hard.""Thank you. You are very generous," she said. The announcement waspleasant to her, but at the moment it seemed of secondary importance.Her enthusiasm had been aroused by the fact and character of his publicdonation, and already her brain was dancing with the thought of theprospect of a rival vital institution in connection with which her viewsand her talents would in all probability be consulted and allowed toexercise themselves. Her's, and not Mrs. Taylor's, or any of thatcensorious and restricting set. In that hospital, at least, ambition andoriginality would be allowed to show what they could do unfettered byenvy or paralyzed by conservatism. "But I can't think of anything now,Mr. Parsons, except the grand secret you have confided to me. Ahospital! It is an ideal gift. It will show the world what noble usesour rich, earnest-minded men make of their money, and it will give ourdoctors and our people a chance to demonstrate what a free hospitalought to be. Oh, I congratulate you. I will write to Mr. Lyons at once."A note in prompt response stated the hour when the lawyer would call. Onhis arrival he was shown immediately to Mr. Parsons's apartments, withwhom he was closeted alone. Selma managed to cross the hall at themoment he was descending, and he was easily persuaded to linger and tofollow her into the library."I was anxious to say a few words to you, Mr. Lyons," she said. "I knowthe purpose for which Mr. Parsons sent for you. He has confided to meconcerning his will--told me everything. It is a noble disposition ofhis property. A free hospital for Benham is an ideal selection, and oneenvies him his opportunity.""Yes. It is a superb and generous benefaction.""I lay awake for hours last night thinking about it; thinkingparticularly of the special point I am desirous to consult you in regardto. I don't wish to appear officious, or to say anything I shouldn't,but knowing from what I heard you state in your speech the other daythat you feel as I do in regard to such matters, I take the liberty ofsuggesting that it seems to me of very great importance that themanagement of this magnificent gift should be in proper hands. May I askyou without impropriety if you will protect Mr. Parsons so that captiousor unenthusiastic persons, men or women, will be unable to control thepolicy of his hospital? He would wish it so, I am sure. I thought ofmentioning the matter to him myself, but I was afraid lest it mightworry him and spoil the satisfaction of his generosity or retard hiscure. Is what I ask possible? Do I make myself clear?""Perfectly--perfectly. A valuable suggestion," he said. "I am glad thatyou have spoken--very glad. Alive as I am to the importance ofprotecting ourselves at all points, I might not have realized thisparticular danger had you not called it to my attention. Perhaps only aclever woman would have thought of it.""Oh, thank you. I felt that I could not keep silence, and run the riskof what might happen.""Precisely. I think I can relieve your mind by telling you--which underthe circumstances is no breach of professional secrecy, for it is plainthat the testator desires you to know his purpose--that Mr. Parsons hasdone me the honor to request me to act as the executor of his will. Assuch I shall be in a position to make sure that those to whom themanagement of his hospital is intrusted are people in whom you and Iwould have confidence.""Ah! That is very satisfactory. It makes everything as it should be, andI am immensely relieved.""Now that you have spoken," he added, meeting her eager gaze with apropitiating look of reflective wisdom, "I will consider theadvisability of taking the further precaution of advising the testatorto name in his will the persons who shall act as the trustees of hischarity. That would clinch the matter. The selection of the individualswould necessarily lie with Mr. Parsons, but it would seem eminentlynatural and fitting that he should name you to represent your sex onsuch a board. I hope it would be agreeable to you to serve?"Selma flushed. "It would be a position which I should prize immensely.Such a possibility had not occurred to me, though I felt that somedefinite provision should be made. The responsibility would be congenialto me and very much in my line.""Assuredly. If you will permit me to say so, you are just the woman forthe place. We have met only a few times, Mrs. Littleton, but I am a manwho forms my conclusions of people rapidly, and it is obvious to me thatyou are thoughtful, energetic, and liberal-minded--qualities which areespecially requisite for intelligent progress in semi-public work. It isessentially desirable to enlist the co-operation of well-equipped womento promote the national weal."Lyons departed with an agreeable impression that he had been talking toa woman who combined mental sagacity and enterprise with considerablefascination of person. This capable companion of Mr. Parsons was nocoquettish or simpering beauty, no mere devotee of fashionable manners,but a mature, well-poised character endowed with ripe intellectual andbodily graces. Their interview suggested that she possessed initiativeand discretion in directing the course of events, and a strong sense ofmoral responsibility, attributes which attracted his interest. He wasobliged to make two more visits before the execution of the will, and oneach occasion he had an opportunity to spend a half-hour alone in thesociety of Selma. He found her gravely and engagingly sympathetic withhis advocacy of democratic principles; he told her of his ambition to beelected to Congress--an ambition which he believed would be realized thefollowing autumn. He confided to her, also, that he was engaged in hisleisure moments in the preparation of a literary volume to be entitled,"Watchwords of Patriotism," a study of the requisites of the bestcitizenship, exemplified by pertinent extracts from the publicutterances of the most distinguished American public servants.Selma on her part reciprocated by a reference to the course of lectureson "Culture and Higher Education," which she had resolved to deliverbefore the Benham Institute during the winter. In these lectures shemeant to emphasize the importance of unfettered individuality, and tocomment adversely on the tendencies hostile to this fundamentalprinciple of progress which she had observed in New York and from whichBenham itself did not appear to her to be entirely exempt. Afterdelivering these lectures in Benham she intended to repeat them invarious parts of the State, and in some of the large cities elsewhere,under the auspices of the Confederated Sisterhood of Women's Clubs ofAmerica, the Sorosis which Mrs. Earle had established on a firm basis,and of which at present she was second vice-president. As a token ofsympathy with this undertaking, Mr. Lyons offered to procure her a freepass on the railroads over which she would be obliged to travel. Thispleased Selma greatly, for she had always regarded free passes as a signof mysterious and enviable importance.Two months later Selma, as secretary of the sub-committee of theInstitute selected to oppose before the legislature the bill to createan appointed school board, had further occasion to confer with Mr.Lyons. He agreed to be the active counsel, and approved of the plan thata delegation of women should journey to the capital, two hours and ahalf by rail, and add the moral support of their presence at the hearingbefore the legislative committee.The expedition was another gratification to Selma--who had becomepossessed of her free pass. She felt that in visiting the state-houseand thus taking an active part in the work of legislation she wasbeginning to fulfil the larger destiny for which she was qualified. Sideby side with Mrs. Earle at the head of a delegation of twenty Benhamwomen she marched augustly into the committee chamber. The contendingfactions sat on opposite sides of the room. Through its middle ran along table occupied by the Committee on Education to which the bill hadbeen referred. Among the dozen or fifteen persons who appeared insupport of the bill Selma perceived Mrs. Hallett Taylor, whom she hadnot seen since her return. She was disappointed to observe that Mrs.Taylor's clothes, though unostentatious, were in the latest fashion. Shehad hoped to find her dowdy or unenlightened, and to be able to lookdown on her from the heights of her own New York experience.The lawyer in charge of the bill presented lucidly and with skill themerits of his case, calling to the stand four prominent educators fromas many different sections of the State, and several citizens ofwell-known character, among them Babcock's former pastor, Rev. HenryGlynn. He pointed out that the school committee, as at presentconstituted, was an unwieldy body of twenty-four members, that it wasregarded as the first round in the ladder of political preferment, andthat the members which composed it were elected not on the ground oftheir fitness, but because they were ambitious for politicalrecognition.The legislative committee listened politely but coldly to thesestatements and to the testimony of the witnesses. It was evident thatthey regarded the proposed reform with distrust."Do you mean us to understand that the public schools of this State arenot among the best, if not the best, in the world?" asked one member ofthe committee, somewhat sternly."I recognize the merits of our school system, but I am not blind to itsfaults," responded the attorney in charge of the bill. He was a man whopossessed the courage of his convictions, but he was a lawyer of tact,and he knew that his answer went to the full limit of what he couldsafely utter by way of qualification without hopelessly imperilling hiscause."Are not our public schools turning out yearly hundreds of boys andgirls who are a growing credit to the soundness of the institutions ofthe country?" continued the same inquisitor.Here was a proposition which opened such a vista of circuitous andcareful speech, were he to attempt to answer it and be true toconscience without being false to patriotism, that Mr. Hunter was drivento reply, "I am unable to deny the general accuracy of your statement.""Then why seek to harass those who are doing such good work byunfriendly legislation?"The member plainly felt that he had disposed of the matter by thistriumphant interrogation, for he listened with scant attention to arepetition of the grounds on which, relief was sought.Mr. Lyons's method of reply was a surprise to Selma. She had looked fora fervid vindication of the principle of the people's choice, and aneloquent, sarcastic setting forth of the evils of the exclusive andaristocratic spirit. He began by complimenting the members of thecommittee on their ability to deal intelligently with the importantquestion before them, and then proceeded to refer to the sincere butmistaken zeal of the advocates of the bill, whom he described as peopleanimated by conscientious motives, but unduly distrustful of thecapacity of the American people. His manner suggested a desire to be atpeace with all the world and was agreeably conciliatory, as though hedeprecated the existence of friction. He said that he would not do themembers of the committee the injustice to suppose that they couldseriously favor the passage of a bill which would deprive theintelligent average voter of one of his dearest privileges; but that hedesired to put himself on record as thinking it a fortunatecircumstance, on the whole, that the well-intentioned promoters of thebill had brought this matter to the attention of the legislature, andhad an opportunity to express their views. He believed that the hearingwould be productive of benefit to both parties, in that on the one handit would tend to make the voters more careful as to whom they selectedfor the important duties of the school board, and on the otherwould--he, as a lover of democratic institutions, hoped--serve toconvince the friends of the bill that they had exaggerated the evils ofthe situation, and that they were engaged in a false and hopelessundertaking in seeking to confine by hard and fast lines the spontaneousyearnings of the American people to control the education of theirchildren. "We say to these critics," he continued, "some of whom areenrolled under the solemn name of reformers, that we welcome their zealand offer co-operation in a resolute purpose to exercise unswervingvigilance in the selection of candidates for the high office ofguardians of our public schools. So far as they will join hands with usin keeping undefiled the traditions of our forefathers, to that extentwe are heartily in accord with them, but when they seek to overridethose traditions and to fasten upon this community a method which isbased on a lack of confidence in democratic theories, then I--andgentlemen, I feel sure that you--are against them."Lyons sat down, having given everyone in the room, with the exception ofa few discerning spirits on the other side, the impression that he hadintended to be pre-eminently fair, and that he had held out the olivebranch when he would have been justified in using the scourge. Theinclination to make friends, to smooth over seamy situations and toavoid repellent language in dealing with adversaries, except incorporation cases before juries and on special occasions when defendinghis political convictions, had become a growing tendency with him nowthat he was in training for public office. Selma did not quite know whatto make of it at first. She had expected that he would crush theiropponents beneath an avalanche of righteous invective. Instead he tookhis seat with an expression of countenance which was no less benignantthan dignified. When the hearing was declared closed, a few minuteslater, he looked in her direction, and in the course of his passage towhere she was sitting stopped to exchange affable greetings withassemblymen and others who came in his way. At his approach Mrs. Earleuttered congratulations so comprehensive that Selma felt able to refrainfor the moment from committing herself. "I am glad that you werepleased," he said. "I think I covered the ground, and no one's feelingshave been hurt." As though he divined what was passing through Selma'smind, he added in an aside intended only for their ears, "It was notnecessary to use all our powder, for I could tell from the way thecommittee acted that they were with us.""I felt sure they would be," exclaimed Mrs. Earle. "And, as you say, itis a pleasure that no one's feelings were hurt, and that we can all partfriends.""Which reminds me," said Lyons, "that I should be glad of anintroduction to Mrs. Taylor as she passes us on her way out. I wish toassure her personally of my willingness to further her efforts toimprove the quality of the school board.""That would be nice of you," said Mrs. Earle, "and ought to please andencourage her, for she will be disappointed, poor thing, and after all Isuppose she means well. There she is now, and I will keep my eye onher.""But surely, Mr. Lyons," said Selma, dazed yet interested by thisdoctrine of brotherly love, "don't you think our school committeeadmirable as it is?""A highly efficient body," he answered. "But I should be glad to haveour opponents--mistaken as we believe them to be--appreciate that we noless than they are zealous to preserve the present high standard. Wemust make them recognize that we are reformers and in sympathy withreform.""I see," said Selma. "For, of course, we are the real reformers. Convertthem you mean? Be civil to them at least? I understand. Yes, I supposethere is no use in making enemies of them." She was thinking aloud.Though ever on her guard to resent false doctrine, she was so sure ofthe loyalty of both her companions that she could allow herself to beinterested by this new point of view--a vast improvement on the New Yorkmanner because of its ethical suggestion. She realized that if Mr. Lyonswas certain of the committee, it was right, and at the same timesensible, not to hurt anyone's feelings unnecessarily--although she felta little suspicious because he had asked to be introduced to Mrs.Taylor. Indeed, the more she thought of this attitude, on the assumptionthat the victory was assured, the more it appealed to her conscience andintelligence; so much so that when Mrs. Earle darted forward to detainMrs. Taylor, Selma was reflecting with admiration on his magnanimity.She observed intently the meeting between Mr. Lyons and Mrs. Taylor. Hewas deferential, complimentary, and genial, and he made a suave,impressive offer of his personal services, in response to which Mrs.Taylor regarded him with smiling incredulity--a smile which Selmaconsidered impertinent. How dared she treat his courtly advances withflippant distrust!"Are you aware, Mr. Lyons," Mrs. Taylor was saying, "that one of thepresent members of the school board is a milkman, and another acarpenter--both of them persons of very ordinary efficiency from aneducational standpoint? Will you co-operate with us, when their termsexpire next year and they seek re-election, to nominate more suitablecandidates in their stead?""I shall be very glad when the time comes to investigate carefully theirqualifications, and if they are proved to be unworthy of the confidenceof the people, to use my influence against them. You may rely onthis--rely on my cordial support, and the support of these ladies," headded, indicating Mrs. Earle and Selma, with a wave of his hand, "who,if you will permit me to say so, are no less interested than you inpromoting good government.""Oh, yes, indeed. We thought we were making an ideal choice in MissLuella Bailey," said Mrs. Earle with effusion. "If Mrs. Taylor had seenmore of her, I feel sure she would have admired her, and then ourInstitute would not have been dragged into politics."Mrs. Taylor did not attempt to answer this appeal. Instead she greetedSelma civilly, and said, "I was sorry to hear that you were against us,Mrs. Littleton. We were allies once in a good cause, and in spite of Mr.Lyons's protestations to the contrary, I assure you that this is anothergenuine opportunity to improve the existing order of things. At least,"she added, gayly but firmly, "you must not let Mr. Lyons's predilectionto see everything through rose-colored spectacles prevent you fromlooking into the matter on your own account.""I have done so already," answered Selma, affronted at the suggestionthat she was uninformed, yet restrained from displaying her annoyance bythe sudden inspiration that here was an admirable opportunity topractise the proselytizing forbearance suggested by Mr. Lyons. The ideaof patronizing Mrs. Taylor from the vantage-ground of infallibility,tinctured by magnanimous condescension, appealed to her. "I have made athorough study of the question, and I never could look at it as you do,Mrs. Taylor. I sided with you before because I thought you wereright--because you were in favor of giving everyone a chance ofexpression. But now I'm on the other side for the same reason--becauseyou and your friends are disposed to deprive people of that very thing,and to regard their aspirations and their efforts contemptuously, if Imay say so. That's the mistake we think you make--we who, as Mr. Lyonshas stated, are no less eager than you to maintain the present highcharacter of everything which concerns our school system. But if youonly would see things in a little different light, both Mrs. Earle and Iwould be glad to welcome you as an ally and to co-operate with you."Selma had not expected to make such a lengthy speech, but as sheproceeded she was spurred by the desire to teach Mrs. Taylor her properplace, and at the same time to proclaim her own allegiance to theattitude of optimistic forbearance."I knew that was the way they felt," said Lyons, ingratiatingly. "Itwould be a genuine pleasure to us all to see this unfortunate differenceof opinion between earnest people obviated."Mrs. Taylor, as Selma was pleased to note, flushed at her concludingoffer, and she answered, drily, "I fear that we are too far apart in ourideas to talk of co-operation. If our bill is defeated this year, weshall have to persevere and trust to the gradual enlightenment of publicsentiment. Good afternoon."Selma left the State-house in an elated frame of mind. She felt that shehad taken a righteous and patriotic stand, and it pleased her to thinkthat she was taking an active part in defending the institutions of thecountry. She chatted eagerly as she walked through the corridors withMr. Lyons, who, portly and imposing, acted as escort to her and Mrs.Earle, and invited them to luncheon at a hotel restaurant. Excitementhad given her more color than usual, to which her mourning acted as afoil, and she looked her best. Lyons was proud of being in the companyof such a presentable and spirited appearing woman, and made a point ofstopping two or three members of the legislature and introducing them toher. When they reached the restaurant he established them at a tablewhere they could see everybody and be seen, and he ordered scollopedoysters, chicken-salad, ice-cream, coffee, and some bottles ofsarsaparilla. Both women were in high spirits, and Selma was agreeablyconscious that people were observing them. Before the repast was over amessenger brought a note to Mr. Lyons, which announced that thelegislative committee had given the petitioners leave to withdraw theirbill, which, in Selma's eyes, justified the management of the affair,and set the seal of complete success on an already absorbing anddelightful occasion.CHAPTER IV.Her mourning and the slow convalescence of Mr. Parsons deprived Selma ofconvincing evidence in regard to her social reception in Benham, forthose socially prominent were thus barred from inviting her to theirhouses, and her own activities were correspondingly fettered. Indeed,her circumstances supplied her with an obvious salve for her properdignity had she been disposed to let suspicion lie fallow. As it was anumber of people had left cards and sent invitations notwithstandingthey could not be accepted, and she might readily have believed, had shechosen--and as she professed openly to Mr. Parsons--that everyone hadbeen uncommonly civil and appreciative.She found herself, however, in spite of her declared devotion to herserious duties, noting that the recognition accorded to Mr. Parsons andherself was not precisely of the character she craved. Thevisiting-cards and invitations were from people residing on the RiverDrive and in that neighborhood, indeed--but from people like the Flaggs,for instance, who, having acquired large wealth and erected lordlydwellings, were eager to dispense good-natured, lavish hospitalitywithout social experience. Her sensitive ordeal in New York hadquickened her social perceptions, so that whereas at the time of herdeparture from Benham as Mrs. Littleton she regarded her presentneighborhood as an integral class, she was now prompt to separate thesheep from the goats, and to remark that only the goats seemed consciousof her existence. With the exception of Mrs. Taylor, who had called whenshe was out, not one of a certain set, the outward manifestations ofwhose stately being were constantly passing her windows, appeared totake the slightest interest in her. Strictly speaking, Mrs. Taylor wasof this set, yet apart from it. Hers was the exclusive intellectual andaesthetic set, this the exclusive fashionable set--both alike execrableand foreign to the traditions of Benham. As Selma had discovered the oneand declared war against it, so she promised herself to confound theother when the period of her mourning was over, and she was free toappear again in society. Once more she congratulated herself that shehad come in time to nip in the bud this other off-shoot of aristocratictendencies. As yet either set was small in number, and she foresaw thatit would be an easy task to unite in a solid phalanx ofoffensive-defensive influence the friendly souls whom these peopletreated as outsiders, and purge the society atmosphere of the miasma ofexclusiveness. In connection with the means to this end, when the winterslipped away and left her feeling that she had been ignored, and thatshe was eager to assume a commanding position, she began to take morethan passing thought of the attentions of Mr. Lyons. That he wasinterested by her there could be no doubt, for he plainly went out ofhis way to seek her society, calling at the house from time to time, andexercising a useful, nattering superintendence over her lecture coursein the other cities of the State, in each of which he appeared to havefriends on the newspaper press who put agreeable notices in printconcerning her performance. She had returned to Benham believing thather married life was over; that her heart was in the grave with Wilbur,and that she would never again part with her independence. The noticewhich Mr. Lyons had taken of her from the outset had gratified her, butthough she contrasted his physical energy with Wilbur's lack of vigor,it had not occurred to her to consider him in the light of a possiblehusband. Now that a year had passed since Wilbur's death, she feltconscious once more, as had happened after her divorce, of the need of acloser and more individual sympathy than any at her command. Herrelations with Mr. Parsons, to be sure, approximated those of father anddaughter, but his perceptions were much less acute than before hisseizure; he talked little and ceased to take a vital interest in currentaffairs. She felt the lack of companionship and, also, of personaldevotion, such personal devotion as was afforded by the strenuous,ardent allegiance of a man. On the other hand she was firmly resolvednever to allow the current of her own life to be turned away again bythe subordination of her purposes to those of any other person, and shehad believed that this resolution would keep her indifferent tomarriage, in spite of any sensations of loneliness or craving formasculine idolatry. But as a widow of a year's standing she was nowsuddenly interested by the thought that this solid, ambitious,smooth-talking man might possibly satisfy her natural preference for amate without violating her individuality. She began to ask herself if hewere not truly congenial in a sense which no man had ever been to herbefore; also, to ask if their aspirations and aims were not so nearlyidentical that he would be certain as her husband to be proud ofeverything she did and said, and to allow her to work hand in hand withhim for the furtherance of their common purpose. She did not put thesequestions to herself until his conduct suggested that he was seeking hersociety as a suitor; but having put them, she was pleased to find herheart throb with the hope of a stimulating and dear discovery.Certain causes contributed to convince her that this hope rested on asure foundation--causes associated with her present life and point ofview. She felt confident first of all of the godliness of Mr. Lyons asindicated not only by his sober, successful life, and his enthusiastic,benignant patriotism, but by his active, reverent interest in theaffairs of his church--the Methodist Church--to which Mr. Parsonsbelonged, and which Selma had begun to attend since her return toBenham. It had been her mother's faith, and she had felt a certainfilial glow in approaching it, which had been fanned into pious flame bythe effect of the ministration. The fervent hymns and the opportunitiesfor bearing testimony at some of the services appealed to her needs andgave her a sense of oneness with eternal truth, which had hitherto beenlacking from her religious experience. In judging Wilbur she wasdisposed to ascribe the defects of his character largely to the coldnessand analyzing sobriety of his creed. She had accompanied him to churchlistlessly, and had been bored by the unemotional appeals to conscienceand quiet subjective designations of duty. She preferred to thrill withthe intensity of words which now roundly rated sin, now passionatelycalled to mind the ransom of the Saviour, and ever kept prominent thestirring mission of evangelizing ignorant foreign people. It appearedprobable to Selma that, as the wife of one of the leadingchurch-members, who was the chairman of the local committee charged withspreading the gospel abroad, her capacity for doing good would bestrengthened, and the spiritual availability of them both be enhanced.Then, too, Mr. Lyons's political prospects were flattering. The thoughtthat a marriage with him would put her in a position to control thesocial tendencies of Benham was alluring. As the wife of Hon. James O.Lyons, Member of Congress, she believed that she would be able to lookdown on and confound those who had given her the cold shoulder. Whatwould Flossy say when she heard it? What would Pauline? This was a formof distinction which would put her beyond the reach of conspiracy andexclusiveness; for, as the wife of a representative, selected by thepeople to guard their interests and make their laws, would not hersocial position be unassailable? And apart from these considerations, apolitical future seemed to her peculiarly attractive. Was not this thereal opportunity for which she had been waiting? Would she be justifiedin giving it up? In what better way could her talents be spent than asthe helpmate and intellectual companion of a public man--a statesmandevoted to the protection and development of American ideas? Her ownindividuality need not, would not be repressed. She had seen enough ofMr. Lyons to feel sure that their views on the great questions of lifewere thoroughly in harmony. They held the same religious opinions. Whocould foretell the limit of their joint progress? He was still a youngman--strong, dignified, and patriotic--endowed with qualities whichfitted him for public service. It might well be that a brilliant futurewas before him--before them, if she were his wife. If he were to becomeprominent in the councils of the nation--Speaker of theHouse--Governor--even President, within the bounds of possibility, whata splendid congenial scope his honors would afford her own versatility!As day by day she dwelt on these points of recommendation, Selma becamemore and more disposed to smile on the aspirations of Mr. Lyons inregard to herself, and to feel that her life would develop to the bestadvantage by a union with him. Until the words asking her to be his wifewere definitely spoken she could not be positive of his intentions, buthis conduct left little room for doubt, and moreover, was marked by adeferential soberness of purpose which indicated to her that his viewsregarding marriage were on a higher plane than those of any man she hadknown. He referred frequently to the home as the foundation on whichAmerican civilization rested, and from which its inspiration was largelyderived, and spoke feelingly of the value to a public man of astimulating and dignifying fireside. It became his habit to join herafter morning service and to accompany her home, carrying herhymn-books, and he sent her from time to time, through the post,quotations which had especially struck his fancy from the speeches hewas collecting for his "Watchwords of Patriotism."Another six months passed, and at its close Lyons received the expectednomination for Congress. The election promised to be close and exciting.Both parties were confident of victory, and were preparing vigorously tokeep their adherents at fever pitch by rallies and torch-lightprocessions. Although the result of the caucus was not doubtful, it wasunderstood between Lyons and Selma that he would call at the house thatevening to let her know that he had been successful. She was waiting toreceive him in the library. Mr. Parsons had gone to bed. His conditionwas not promising. He had recently suffered another slight attack ofparalysis, which seemed to indicate that he was liable at any time to afatal seizure.Lyons entered smilingly. "So far so good," he exclaimed."Then you have won?""Oh, yes. As I told you, it was a foregone conclusion. Now the fightbegins."Selma, who had provided a slight refection, handed him a cup of tea. "Ifeel sure that you will be chosen," she said. "See if I am not right.When is the election?""In six weeks. Six weeks from to-morrow.""Then you will go to Washington to live?""Not until the fourth of March.""I envy you. If I were a man I should prefer success in politics toanything else."He was silent for a moment. Then he said, "Will you help me to achievesuccess? Will you go with me to Washington as my wife?"His courtship had been formal and elaborate, but his declaration wassignally simple and to the point. Selma noticed that the cup in his handtrembled. While she kept her eyes lowered, as women are supposed to doat such moments, she was wondering whether she loved him as much as shehad loved Wilbur? Not so ardently, but more worthily, she concluded, forhe seemed to her to fulfil her maturer ideal of strong and effectivemanhood, and to satisfy alike her self-respect and her physical fancy. Aman of his type would not split hairs, but proceed straight toward thegoal of his ambition without fainting or wavering. Why should she notsatisfy her renewed craving to be yoked to a kindred spirit andcompanion who appreciated her true worth?"I cannot believe," he was saying, "that my words are a surprise to you.You can scarcely have failed to understand that I admired you extremely.I have delayed to utter my desire to make you my wife because I did notdare to cherish too fondly the hope that the love inspired in me couldbe reciprocated, and that you would consent to unite your life to mineand trust your happiness to my keeping. If I may say so, we are no boyand girl. We understand the solemn significance of marriage; what itimports and what it demands. Of late I have ventured to dream that thesympathy in ideas and identity of purpose which exist between us mightbe the trustworthy sign of a spiritual bond which we could not afford toignore. I feel that without you the joy and power of my life will beincomplete. With you at my side I shall aspire to great things. You areto me the embodiment of what is charming and serviceable in woman."Selma looked up. "I like you very much, Mr. Lyons. You, in your turn,must have realized that, I think. As you say, we are no boy and girl.You meant by that, too, that we both have been married before. I havehad two husbands, and I did not believe that I could ever think ofmarriage again. I don't wish you to suppose that my last marriage wasnot happy. Mr. Littleton was an earnest, talented man, and devoted tome. Yet I cannot deny that in spite of mutual love our married life wasnot a success--a success as a contribution to accomplishment. Thatnearly broke my heart, and he--he died from lack of the physical andmental vigor which would have made so much difference. I am telling youthis because I wish you to realize that if I should consent to complywith your wishes, it would be because I was convinced that trueaccomplishment--the highest accomplishment--would result from the unionof our lives as the result of our riper experience. If I did notbelieve, Mr. Lyons, that man and woman as we are--no longer boy andgirl--a more perfect scheme of happiness, a grander conception of themeaning of life than either of us had entertained was before us, I wouldnot consider your offer for one moment.""Yes, yes, I understand," Lyons exclaimed eagerly. "I share your beliefimplicitly. It was what I would have said only--"Despite his facility as an orator, Lyons left this sentence incompletein face of the ticklish difficulty of explaining that he had refrainedfrom suggesting such a hope to a widow who had lost her husband only twoyears before. Yet he hastened to bridge over this ellipsis by saying,"Without such a faith a union between us must fall short of its sweetestand grandest opportunities.""It would be a mockery; there would be no excuse for its existence,"cried Selma impetuously. "I am an idealist, Mr. Lyons," she saidclasping her hands. "I believe devotedly in the mission and power oflove. But I believe that our conception of love changes as we grow. Iwelcomed love formerly as an intoxicating, delirious potion, and as suchit was very sweet. You have just told me of your own feelings toward me,so it is your right to know that lately I have begun to realize that myassociation with you has brought peace into my life--peace and religiousfaith--essentials of happiness of which I have not known the blessingssince I was a child. You have dedicated yourself to a lofty work; youhave chosen the noble career of a statesman--a statesman zealous topromote principles in which we both believe. And you ask me to sharewith you the labors and the privileges which will result from thisdedication. If I accept your offer, it must be because I know that Ilove you--love you in a sense I have not loved before--may the deadpardon me! If I accept you it will be because I wish to perpetuate thatfaith and peace, and because I believe that our joint lives will realizeworthy accomplishment." Selma looked into space with her wrapt gaze,apparently engaged in an intense mental struggle."And you will accept? You do feel that you can return my love? I cannottell you how greatly I am stirred and stimulated by what you have said.It makes me feel that I could never be happy without you." Lyons putinto this speech all his solemnity and all his emotional beneficence oftemperament. He was genuinely moved. His first marriage had been a lovematch. His wife--a mere girl--had died within a year; so soon that thememory of her was a tender but hazy sentiment rather than a formulatedimpression of character. By virtue of this memory he had approachedmarriage again as one seeking a companion for his fireside, and acomely, sensible woman to preside over his establishment and promote hissocial status, rather than one expecting to be possessed by or toinspire a dominant passion. Yet he, too, regarded himself distinctly asan idealist, and he had lent a greedy ear to Selma's suggestion thatmature mutual sympathy and comradeship in establishing convictions andreligious aims were the source of a nobler type of love than thatassociated with early matrimony. It increased his admiration for her,and gave to his courtship, the touch of idealism which--partly owing tohis own modesty as a man no longer in the flush of youth--it had lacked.He nervously stroked his beard with his thick hand, and gave himself upto the spell of this vision of blessedness while he eagerly watchedSelma's face and waited for her answer. To combine moral purpose andlove in a pervasive alliance appealed to him magnetically as a religiousman.Selma, as she faced Lyons, was conscious necessarily of the contrastbetween him and her late husband. But she was attuned to regard hiscoarser physical fibre as masculine vigor and a protest againstaristocratic delicacy, and to derive comfort and exaltation from it."Mr. Lyons," she said, "I will tell you frankly that the circumstancesof married life have hitherto hampered the expression of that which isin me, and confined the scope of my individuality within narrow anduncongenial limits. I am not complaining; I have no intention to rake upthe past; but it is proper you should know that I believe myself capableof larger undertakings than have yet been afforded me, and worthy ofampler recognition than I have yet received. If I accept you as ahusband, it will be because I feel confident that you will give my lifethe opportunity to expand, and that you sympathize with my desire toexpress myself adequately and to labor hand in hand, side by side, withyou in the important work of the world.""That is what I would have you do, Selma. Because you are worthy of it,and because it is your right.""On that understanding it seems that we might be very happy.""I am certain of it. You fill my soul with gladness," he cried, andseizing her hand he pressed it to his lips and covered it with kisses,but she withdrew it, saying, "Not yet--not yet. This step represents somuch to me. It means that if I am mistaken in you, my whole life will beruined, for the next years should be my best. We must not be too hasty.There are many things to be thought of. I must consider Mr. Parsons. Icannot leave him immediately, if at all, for he is very dependent onme.""I had thought of that. While Mr. Parsons lives, I realize that yourfirst duty must be to him."The reverential gravity of his tone was in excess of the needs of theoccasion, and Selma understood that he intended to imply that Mr.Parsons would not long need her care. The same thought was in her ownmind, and it had occurred to her in the course of her previouscogitations in regard to Lyons, that in the event of his death it wouldsuit her admirably to continue to occupy the house as its real mistress.She looked grave for a moment in her turn, then with a sudden access ofcoyness she murmured, "I do not believe that I am mistaken in you.""Ah," he cried, and would have folded her in his arms, but she evadedhis onset and said with her dramatic intonation, "The knights of old wontheir lady-loves by brilliant deeds. If you are elected a member ofCongress, you may come to claim me."Reflection served only to convince Selma of the wisdom of her decisionto try matrimony once more. She argued, that though a third marriagemight theoretically seem repugnant if stated as a bald fact, the actualcircumstances in her case not merely exonerated her from a lack ofdelicacy, but afforded an exhibition of progress--a gradual evolution incharacter. She felt light-hearted and triumphant at the thought of herimpending new importance as the wife of a public man, and she interestedherself exuberantly in the progress of the political campaign. She waspleased to think that her stipulation had given her lover a new spur tohis ambition, and she was prepared to believe that his victory would bedue to the exhaustive efforts to win which the cruel possibility oflosing her obliged him to make.This was a campaign era of torch-light processions. The rival factionsexpressed their confidence and enthusiasm by parading at night in aseries of battalions armed with torches--some resplendently flaring,some glittering gayly through colored glass--and bearing transparenciesinscribed with trenchant sentiments. The houses of their adherents alongthe route were illuminated from attic to cellar with rows of candles,and the atmosphere wore a dusky glow of red and green fire. To Selma allthis was entrancing. She revelled in it as an introduction to the moreconspicuous life which she was about to lead. She showed herself azealous and enthusiastic partisan, shrouding the house in the darknessof Erebus on the occasion when the rival procession passed the door, andimparting to every window the effect of a blaze of light on thefollowing evening--the night before election--when the Democratic partymade its final appeal to the voters. Standing on a balcony in eveningdress, in company with Mrs. Earle and Miss Luella Bailey, whom she hadinvited to view the procession from the River Drive, Selma looked downon the parade in an ecstatic mood. The torches, the music, the fireworksand the enthusiasm set her pulses astir and brought her heart into hermouth in melting appreciation of the sanctity of her party cause and herown enviable destiny as the wife of an American Congressman. She held inone hand a flag which she waved from time to time at the conspicuousfeatures of the procession, and she stationed herself so that the Bengallights and other fireworks set off by Mr. Parsons's hired man shouldthrow her figure into conspicuous relief. The culminating interest ofthe, occasion for her was reached when the James O. Lyons Cadets, thespecial body of youthful torch-bearers devoted to advertising the meritsof her lover, for whose uniforms and accoutrements he had paid, came insight.They proved to be the most flourishing looking organization in line.They were preceded by a large, nattily attired drum corps; their rankswere full, their torches lustrous, and they bore a number oftransparencies setting forth the predominant qualifications of thecandidate for Congress from the second district, the largest of whichpresented his portrait superscribed with the sentiment, "A vote forJames O. Lyons is a vote in support of the liberties of the plainpeople." On the opposite end of the canvas was the picture of the kingof beasts, with open jaws and bristling mane, with the motto, "OurLyons's might will keep our institutions sacred." In the midst of thisglittering escort the candidate himself rode in an open barouche on hisway to the hall where he was to deliver a final speech. He was bowing toright and left, and constant cheers marked his progress along theavenue. Selma leaned forward from the balcony to obtain the earliestsight of her hero. The rolling applause was a new, intoxicating music inher ears, and filled her soul with transport. She clapped her handsvehemently; seized a roman-candle, and amid a blaze of fiery sparksexploded its colored stars in the direction of the approaching carriage.Then with the flag slanted across her bosom, she stood waiting for hisrecognition. It was made solemnly, but with the unequivocaldemonstration of a cavalier or knight of old, for Lyons stood up, anddoffing his hat toward her, made a conspicuous salute. A salvo ofapplause suggested to Selma that the multitude had understood that hewas according to her the homage due a lady-love, and that their cheerswere partly meant for her. She put her hand to her bosom with thegesture of a queen of melodrama, and culling one from a bunch of rosesLyons had sent her that afternoon threw it from the balcony at thecarriage. The flower fell almost into the lap of her lover, who clutchedit, pressed it to his lips, and doffed his hat again. The episode hadbeen visible to many, and a hoarse murmur of interested approval crownedthe performance. The glance of the crowds on the sidewalk was turnedupward, and someone proposed three cheers for the lady in the balcony.They were given. Selma bowed to either side in delighted acknowledgment,while the torches of the cadets waved tumultuously, and there was afresh outburst of colored fires."I can't keep the secret any longer," she exclaimed, turning to her twocompanions. "I'm engaged to be married to Mr. Lyons."CHAPTER V.Lyons was chosen to Congress by a liberal margin. The Congressionaldelegation from his State was almost evenly divided between the twoparties as the result of the election, and the majorities in every casewere small. Consequently the more complete victory of Lyons was afeather in his cap, and materially enhanced his political standing.The sudden death of Mr. Parsons within a week of the election savedSelma's conscience from the strain of arranging a harmonious andequitable separation from him. She had felt that the enlargement of hersphere of life and the opportunity to serve her country which thismarriage offered were paramount to any other considerations, but she wasduly conscious that Mr. Parsons would miss her sorely, and she wasconsidering the feasibility of substituting Miss Bailey as his companionin her place, when fate supplied a different solution. Selma had pledgedher friends to secrecy, so that Mr. Parsons need know nothing until theplans for his happiness had been perfected, and he died in ignorance ofthe interesting matrimonial alliance which had been fostered under hisroof. By the terms of his will Selma was bequeathed the twenty thousanddollars he had promised her. She and Mr. Lyons, with a third person, tobe selected by them, were appointed trustees of the Free Hospital withwhich he had endowed Benham, and Mr. Lyons was nominated as the soleexecutor under the will.Selma's conception that her third betrothal was coincident withspiritual development, and that she had fought her way through hamperingcircumstances to a higher plane of experience, had taken firm hold ofher imagination. She presently confessed to Lyons that she had nothitherto appreciated the full meaning of the dogma that marriage was asacrament. She evinced a disposition to show herself with him at churchgatherings, and to cultivate the acquaintance of his pastor. She feltthat she had finally secured the opportunity to live the sober, simplelife appropriate to those who believed in maintaining Americanprinciples, and in eschewing luxurious and effete foreign innovations;the sort of life she had always meant to live, and from which she hadbeen debarred. She had now not only opportunity, but a responsibility.As the bride of a Congressman, it behooved her both to pursue virtue forits own sake and for the sake of example. It was incumbent on her topreserve and promote democratic conditions in signal opposition toso-called fashionable society, and at the same time to assert her ownproper dignity and the dignity of her constituents by a suitable outwardshow.This last subtlety of reflection convinced Selma that they ought tooccupy the house on the River Drive. Lyons himself expressed some doubtsas to the advisability of this. He admitted that he could afford theexpense, and that it was just such a residence as he desired, but hesuggested that their motives might not be understood, and he questionedwhether it were wise, with the State so close, to give his politicalenemies the chance to make unjust accusations."Of course you ought to understand about this matter better than I," shesaid; "but I have the feeling, James, that your constituents will bedisappointed if we don't show ourselves appreciative of the dignity ofyour position. We both agree that we should make Benham our home, andthat it will be preferable if I visit Washington a month or two at atime during the session rather than for us to set up housekeeping there,and I can't help believing that the people will be better pleased ifyou, as their representative, make that home all which a beautiful homeshould be. They will be proud of it, and if they are, you needn't mindwhat a few fault-finders say. I have been thinking it over, and it seemsto me that we shall make a mistake to let this house go. It just suitsus. I feel sure that in their hearts the American people like to havetheir public men live comfortably. This house is small compared to manyin New York, and I flatter myself that we shall be able to satisfyeveryone that we are rootedly opposed to unseemly extravagance ofliving."Lyons yielded readily to this argument. He had been accustomed to simplesurroundings, but travel and the growth of Benham itself haddemonstrated to him that the ways of the nation in respect to materialpossessions and comforts had undergone a marked change since his youth.He had been brought in contact with this new development in his capacityof adviser to the magnates of Benham, and he had fallen under the spellof improved creature comforts. Still, though he cast sheep's eyes atthese flesh pots, he had felt chary, both as a worker for righteousnessand an ardent champion of popular principles, of countenancing themopenly. Yet his original impulse toward marriage had been a desire tosecure an establishment, and now that this result was at hand he foundhimself ambitious to put his household on a braver footing, providedthis would do injury neither to his moral scruples nor to his politicalsincerity. The problem was but another phase of that presented to him byhis evolution from a jury lawyer, whose hand and voice were againstcorporations, to the status of a richly paid chamber adviser torailroads and banking houses. He was exactly in the frame of mind tograsp at the euphemism offered by Selma. He was not one to be convincedwithout a reason, but his mind eagerly welcomed a suggestion whichjustified on a moral ground the proceeding to which they were bothinclined. The idea that the people would prefer to see him as theirrepresentative living in a style consistent with the changes in mannersand customs introduced by national prosperity, affording thereby anexample of correct and elevating stewardship of reasonable wealth, byway of contrast to vapid society doings, came to him as an illuminationwhich dissipated his doubts.The wedding took place about three months after the death of Mr.Parsons. In her renovated outlook regarding matrimony, Selma includedformal preparations for and some pomp of circumstances at the ceremony.It suited her pious mood that she was not required again to be marriedoff-hand, and that she could plight her troth in a decorous fashion,suitably attired and amid conventional surroundings. Her dress was asubject of considerable contemplation. She guided her lover's generosityuntil it centred on a diamond spray for her hair and two rings set withhandsome precious stones. She did not discourage Miss Luella Bailey fromheralding the approaching nuptials in the press. She became Mrs. Lyonsin a conspicuous and solemn fashion before the gaze of everybody inBenham whom there was any excuse for asking to the church. After acollation at the Parsons house, the happy pair started on theirhoneymoon in a special car put at their service by one of the railroadsfor which the bridegroom was counsel. This feature delighted Selma.Indeed, everything, from the complimentary embrace of her husband'spastor to the details of her dress and wedding presents, described withelaborate good will in the evening newspapers, appeared to hergratifying and appropriate.They were absent six weeks, during which the Parsons house was to beredecorated and embellished within and without according to instructionsgiven by Selma before her departure. Their trip extended to Californiaby way of the Yosemite. Selma had never seen the wonders of the farwestern scenery, and this appropriate background for their sentimentalso afforded Lyons the opportunity to inspect certain railroad lines inwhich he was financially interested. The atmosphere of the gorgeoussnow-clad peaks and impressive chasms served to heighten still furtherthe intensity of Selma's frame of mind. She managed adroitly on severaloccasions to let people know who they were, and it pleased her toobserve the conductor indicating to passengers in the common cars thatthey were Congressman Lyons and his wife on their honeymoon. She waslooking forward to Washington, and as she stood in the presence of theinspiring beauties of nature she was prone to draw herself up inrehearsal of the dignity which she expected to wear. What were thesemountains and canyons but physical counterparts of the human soul? Whatbut correlative representatives of grand ideas, of noble lives devotedto the cause of human liberty? She felt that she was very happy, and shebore testimony to this by walking arm in arm with her husband, leaningagainst his firm, stalwart shoulder. It seemed to her desirable that thepublic should know that they were a happy couple and defenders of thepurity of the home. On their way back the train was delayed onWashington's birthday for several hours by a wash-out, and presently adeputation made up of passengers and townspeople waited on Lyons andinvited him to deliver an open-air address. He and Selma, when thecommittee arrived, were just about to explore the neighborhood, andLyons, though ordinarily he would have been glad of such an opportunity,looked at his wife with an expression which suggested that he wouldprefer a walk with her. The eyes of the committee followed his,appreciating that he had thrown the responsibility of a decision on hisbride. Selma was equal to the occasion. "Of course he will address you,"she exclaimed. "What more suitable place could there be for offeringhomage to the father of our country than this majestic prairie?" Sheadded, proudly, "And I am glad you should have the opportunity to hearmy husband speak."Some letters requiring attention were forwarded to Lyons at one of thecities where they stopped. As they lay on his dressing-table Selmacaught sight of the return address, Williams & Van Horne, printed on theuppermost envelope. The reminder aroused a host of associations. Flossyhad not been much in her thoughts lately, yet she had not failed toplume herself occasionally with the reflection that she could afford nowto snap her fingers at her. She had wondered more than once what Flossywould think when she heard that she was the wife of a Representative."Do you know these people personally?" she inquired, holding up theenvelope."Yes. They are my--er--financial representatives in New York. I haveconsiderable dealings with them."Selma had not up to this time concerned herself as to the details of herhusband's affairs. He had made clear to her that his income from hisprofession was large, and she knew that he was interested in a varietyof enterprises. That he should have connections with a firm of New Yorkbrokers was one more proof to her of his common sense and capacity totake advantage of opportunities."Mr. Littleton used to buy stocks through Williams and Van Horne--only afew. He was not very clever at it, and failed to make the most of thechances given him to succeed in that way. We knew the Williamses at onetime very well. They lived in the same block with us for several yearsafter we were married.""Williams is a capable, driving sort of fellow. Bold, but on the wholesagacious, I think," answered Lyons, with demure urbanity. It was rathera shock to him that his wife should learn that he had dealings in thestock market. He feared lest it might seem to her inconsistent with hisother propensities--his religious convictions and his abhorrence ofcorporate rapacity. He preferred to keep such transactions private forfear they should be misunderstood. At heart he did not altogetherapprove of them himself. They were a part of his evolution, and haddeveloped by degrees until they had become now so interwoven with hiswhole financial outlook that he could not escape from them at the momentif he would. Indeed some of them were giving him anxiety. He hadsupposed that the letter in question contained a request for aremittance to cover depreciation in his account. Instead he had readwith some annoyance a confidential request from Williams that he wouldwork for a certain bill which, in his capacity as a foe of monopoly, hehad hoped to be able to oppose. It offended his conscience to think thathe might be obliged secretly to befriend a measure against which hisvote must be cast. As has been intimated, he would have preferred thathis business affairs should remain concealed from his wife. Yet herremarks were unexpectedly and agreeably reassuring. They served tofurnish a fresh indication on her part of intelligent sympathy with theperplexities which beset the path of an ambitious public man. Theysuggested a subtle appreciation of the reasonableness of his behavior,notwithstanding its apparent failure to tally with his outwardprofessions.Selma's reply interrupted this rhapsody."I ought to tell you, I suppose, that I quarrelled with Mrs. Williamsbefore I left New York. Or, rather, she quarrelled with me. She insultedme in my own house, and I was obliged to order her to leave it.""Quarrelled? That is a pity. An open break? Open breaks in friendshipare always unfortunate." Lyons looked grieved, and fingered his beardmeditatively."I appreciate," said Selma, frankly, "that our falling out will be aninconvenience in case we should meet in Washington or elsewhere, sinceyou and Mr. Williams have business interests in common. Of course,James, I wish to help you in every way I can. I might as well tell youabout it. I think she was jealous of me and fancied I was trying to cuther out socially. At all events, she insinuated that I was not a lady,because I would not lower my standards to hers, and adopt the frivoloushabits of her little set. But I have not forgotten, James, yoursuggestion that people in public life can accomplish more if they avoidshowing resentment and strive for harmony. I shall be ready to forgetthe past if Mrs. Williams will, for my position as your wife puts mebeyond the reach of her criticism. She's a lively little thing in herway, and her husband seems to understand about investments and how toget ahead."They went direct to Washington without stopping at Benham. It wasunderstood that the new session of Congress was to be very short, andthey were glad of an opportunity to present themselves in an officialcapacity at the capital as a conclusion to their honeymoon, beforesettling down at home. Selma found a letter from Miss Bailey, containingthe news that Pauline Littleton had accepted the presidency of WetmoreCollege, the buildings of which were now practically completed. Selmagasped as she read this. She had long ago decided that hersister-in-law's studies were unpractical, and that Pauline was doomed toteach small classes all her days, a task for which she was doubtlesswell fitted. She resented the selection, for, in her opinion, Paulinelacked the imaginative talent of Wilbur, and yet shared his subjective,unenthusiastic ways. More than once it had occurred to her that thepresidency of Wetmore was the place of all others for which she herselfwas fitted. Indeed, until Lyons had offered himself she had cherished inher inner consciousness the hope that the course of events mightdemonstrate that she was the proper person to direct the energies ofthis new medium for the higher education of women. It irritated her tothink that an institution founded by Benham philanthropy, and whichwould be a vital influence in the development of Benham womanhood,should be under the control of one who was hostile to American theoriesand methods. Selma felt so strongly on the subject that she thought ofairing her objections in a letter to Mr. Flagg, the donor, but sheconcluded to suspend her strictures until her return to Benham. Shesent, however, to Miss Bailey, who was now regularly attached to one ofthe Benham newspapers, notes for an article which should deplore thechoice by the trustees of one who was unfamiliar and presumably out ofsympathy with Benham thought and impulse.Selma's emotions on her arrival in Washington were very different fromthose which she had experienced in New York as the bride of Littleton.Then she had been unprepared for, dazed, and offended by what she saw.Now, though she mentally assumed that the capital was the parade groundof American ideas and principles, she felt not merely no surprise at theaugust appearance of the wide avenues, but she was eagerly on thelookout, as they drove from the station to the hotel, for signs ofsocial development. The aphorism which she had supplied to her husband,that the American people prefer to have their representatives livecomfortably, dwelt in her thoughts and was a solace to her. Despite herNew York experience, she had the impression that the doors of everyhouse in Washington would fly open at her approach as the wife of aCongressman. She did not formulate her anticipations as to herreception, but she entertained a general expectation that their presencewould be acknowledged as public officials in a notable way. She dressedherself on the morning after their arrival at the hotel with someshowiness, so as to be prepared for flattering emergencies. She had saidlittle to her husband on the subject, for she had already discoveredthat, though he was ambitious that they should appear well, he wasdisposed to leave the management of social concerns to her. Hisinformation had been limited to bidding her come prepared for thereception to be given at the White House at the reassembling ofCongress. Selma had brought her wedding-dress for this, and was lookingforward to it as a gala occasion.The hotel was very crowded, and Selma became aware that many of theguests were the wives and daughters of other Congressmen, who seemed tobe in the same predicament as herself--that is, without anyone to speakto and waiting in their best clothes for something to happen. Lyons knewa few of them, and was making acquaintances in the corridors, with someof whom he exchanged an introduction of wives. As she successively metthese other women, Selma perceived that no one of them was betterdressed than herself, and she reflected with pleasure that they woulddoubtless be available allies in her crusade against frivolity andexclusiveness.Presently she set out with her husband to survey the sights of the city.Naturally their first visit was to the Capitol, in the presence of whichSelma clutched his arm in the pride of her patriotism and of herpleasure that he was to be one of the makers of history within itssplendid precincts. The sight of the stately houses of Congress,superbly dominated by their imposing dome, made them both walk proudly,lost, save for occasional vivid phrases of admiration, in thecontemplation of their own possible future. What greater earthly prizefor man than political distinction among a people capable of monumentslike this? What grander arena for a woman eager to demonstrate truth andpromote righteousness? There was, of course, too much to see for any onevisit. They went up to the gallery of the House of Representatives andlooked down on the theatre of Lyons's impending activities. He was totake his seat on the day after the morrow as one of the minority party,but a strong, vigorous minority. Selma pictured him standing in theaisle and uttering ringing words of denunciation against corporatemonopolies and the money power."I shall come up here and listen to you often. I shall be able to tellif you speak loud enough--so that the public can hear you," she said,glancing at the line of galleries which she saw in her mind's eyecrowded with spectators. "You must make a long speech very soon.""That is very unlikely indeed. They tell me a new member rarely gets achance to be heard," answered Lyons."But they will hear you. You have something to say."Lyons squeezed her hand. Her words nourished the same hope in his ownbreast. "I shall take advantage of every opportunity to obtainrecognition, and to give utterance to my opinions.""Oh yes, I shall expect you to speak. I am counting on that."On their way down they scanned with interest the statues and portraitsof distinguished statesmen and heroes, and the representations of famousepisodes in American history with which the walls of the landings andthe rotunda are lined."Some day you will be here," said Selma. "I wonder who will paint you ormake your bust. I have often thought," she added, wistfully, "that, if Ihad given my mind to it, I could have modelled well in clay. Some dayI'll try. It would be interesting, wouldn't it, to have you here inmarble with the inscription underneath, 'Bust of the Honorable James O.Lyons, sculptured by his wife?'"Lyons laughed, but he was pleased. "You are making rapid strides, mydear. I am sure of one thing--if my bust or portrait ever is here, Ishall owe my success largely to your devotion and good sense. I feltcertain of it before, but our honeymoon has proved to me that we weremeant for one another.""Yes, I think we were. And I like to hear you say I have good sense.That is what I pride myself on as a wife."On their return to the hotel Selma was annoyed to find that no one but amember of her husband's Congressional delegation had called. She hadhoped to find that their presence in Washington was known andappreciated. It seemed to her, moreover, that they were not treated atthe hotel with the deference she had supposed would be accorded to them.To be sure, equality was of the essence of American doctrine;nevertheless she had anticipated that the official representatives ofthe people would be made much of, and distinguished from the rest of theworld, if not by direct attention, by being pointed out and looked atadmiringly. Still, as Lyons showed no signs of disappointment, sheforbore to express her own perplexity, which was temporarily relieved byan invitation from him to drive. The atmosphere was mild enough for anopen carriage, and Selma's appetite for processional effect derived somecrumbs of comfort from the process of showing herself in a barouche bythe side of her husband. They proceeded in an opposite direction fromthe Capitol, and after surveying the outside of the White House, drovealong the avenues and circles occupied by private residences. Selmanoticed that these houses, though attractive, were less magnificent andconspicuous than many of those in New York--more like her own in Benham;and she pictured as their occupants the families of the public men ofthe country--a society of their wives and daughters living worthily,energetically, and with becoming stateliness, yet at the same timerebuking by their example frivolity and rampant luxury. She observedwith satisfaction the passage of a number of private carriages, and thattheir occupants were stylishly clad. She reflected that, as, the wife ofa Congressman, her place was among them, and she was glad that theyrecognized the claims of social development so far as to dress well andlive in comfort. Before starting she had herself fastened a bunch of redroses at her waist as a contribution to her picturesqueness as a publicwoman.While she was thus absorbed in speculation, not altogether free fromworrying suspicions, in spite of her mental vision as to the occupantsof these private residences, she uttered an ejaculation of surprise as ajaunty victoria passed by them, and she turned her head in an eagerattempt to ascertain if her surprise and annoyance were well-founded.The other vehicle was moving rapidly, but a similar curiosity impelledone of its occupants to look hack also, and the eyes of the two womenmet."It's she; I thought it was.""Who, my dear?" said Lyons."Flossy Williams--Mrs. Gregory Williams. I wonder," she added, in asevere tone, "what she is doing here, and how she happens to beassociating with these people. That was a private carriage.""Williams has a number of friends in Washington, I imagine. I thought itlikely that he would be here. That was another proof of your good sense,Selma--deciding to let bygones be bygones and to ignore yourdisagreement with his wife.""Yes, I know. I shall treat her civilly. But my heart will be broken,James, if I find that Washington is like New York.""In what respect?""If I find that the people in these houses lead exclusive, un-American,godless lives. It would tempt me almost to despair of our country," sheexclaimed, with tragic emphasis."I don't understand about social matters, Selma. I must leave those toyou. But," he added, showing that he shrewdly realized the cause of heranguish better than she did herself, "as soon as we get betteracquainted, I'm sure you will find that we shall get ahead, and that youwill be able to hold your own with anybody, however exclusive."Selma colored at the unflattering simplicity of his deduction. "I don'tdesire to hold my own with people of that sort. I despise them.""I know. Hold your own, I mean, among people of the right sort by forceof sound ideas and principles. The men and women of to-day," hecontinued, with melodious asseveration, "are the grand-children of thosewho built the splendid halls we visited this morning as a monument toour nation's love of truth and righteousness. A few frivolous, worldlyminded spirits are not the people of the United States to whom we lookfor our encouragement and support.""Assuredly," answered Selma, with eagerness. "It is difficult, though,not to get discouraged at times by the behavior of those who ought toaid instead of hinder our progress as a nation."For a moment she was silent in wrapt meditation, then she asked:"Didn't you expect that more notice would be taken of our arrival?""In what way?""In some way befitting a member of Congress."Lyons laughed. "My dear Selma, I am one new Congressman among severalhundred. What did you expect? That the President and his wife would comeand take us to drive?""Of course not." She paused a moment, then she said: "I suppose that, asyou are not on the side of the administration, we cannot expect muchnotice to be taken of us until you speak in the House. I will try not tobe too ambitious for you, James; but it would be easier to be patient,"she concluded, with her far-away look, "if I were not beginning to fearthat this city also may be contaminated just as New York is."CHAPTER VI.The incidents of the next two days previous to her attendance at theevening reception at the White House restored Selma's equanimity. Shehad the satisfaction of being present at the opening ceremonies of theHouse of Representatives, and of beholding her husband take the oath ofoffice. She was proud of Lyons as she looked down on him from thegallery standing in the aisle by his allotted seat. He was holding animprovised reception, for a number of his colleagues showed themselvesdesirous to make his acquaintance. She noticed that he appeared alreadyon familiar terms with some of his fellow-members; that he drew men orwas drawn aside for whispered confidences; that he joked knowingly withothers; and that always as he chatted his large, round, smooth face,relieved by its chin beard, wore an aspect of bland dignity and shrewdreserve wisdom. It pleased her to be assisting at the dedication of afresh page of national history--a page yet unwritten, but on which shehoped that her own name would be inscribed sooner or later by those whoshould seek to trace the complete causes of her husband's usefulness andgenius.Another source of satisfaction was the visit paid them the day before atthe hotel by one of the United States Senators from their own State--Mr.Calkins. The two political parties in their own State were so evenlydivided that one of the Senators in office happened to be a Republicanand his colleague a Democrat. Mr. Calkins belonged to her husband'sparty, yet he suggested that they might enjoy a private audience withthe President, with whom, notwithstanding political differences ofopinion, Mr. Calkins was on friendly terms. This was the sort of thingwhich Selma aspired to, and the experience did much to lighten herheart. She enjoyed the distinction of seeing guarded doors open at theirapproach, and of finding herself shaking hands with the chief magistrateof the nation at a special interview. The President was very affable,and was manifestly aware of Lyons's triumph at the expense of his ownparty, and of his consequent political importance. He treated the matterbanteringly, and Selma was pleased at her ability to enter into thespirit of his persiflage and to reciprocate. In her opinion solemnitywould have been more consistent with his position as the officialrepresentative of the people of the United States, and his jocosemanifestations at a time when serious conversation seemed to be in orderwas a disappointment, and tended to confirm her previous distrust of himas the leader of the opposite party. She had hoped he would broach somevital topics of political interest, and that she would have theopportunity to give expression to her own views in regard to publicquestions. Nevertheless, as the President saw fit to be humorous, shewas glad that she understood how to meet and answer his banteringsallies. She felt sure that Lyons, were he ever to occupy this dignifiedoffice, would refrain from ill-timed levity, but she bore in mind alsothe policy of conciliation which she had learned from her husband, andconcealed her true impressions. She noticed that both Lyons and Mr.Calkins forebore to show dissatisfaction, and she reflected that, thoughthe President's tone was light, there was nothing else in his appearanceor bearing to convict him of sympathy with lack of enthusiasm and withcynicism. It would have destroyed all the enjoyment of her interview hadshe been forced to conclude that a man who did not take himself and hisduties seriously could be elected President of the United States. Shewas not willing to believe this; but her suspicions were so far arousedthat she congratulated herself that her political opponents wereresponsible for his election. Nevertheless she was delighted by thedistinction of the private audience, and by the episode at its close,which gave her opportunity to show her individuality. Said the Presidentgallantly as she was taking leave:"Will you permit me to congratulate Congressman Lyons on his goodfortune in the affairs of the heart as well as in politics?""If you say things like that, Mr. President," interjected Lyons, "youwill turn her head; she will become a Republican, and then where shouldI be?"While she perceived that the President was still inclined to levity, thecompliment pleased Selma. Yet, though she appreciated that her husbandwas merely humoring him by his reply, she did not like the suggestionthat any flattery could affect her principles. She shook her headcoquettishly and said:"James, I'm sure the President thinks too well of American women tobelieve that any admiration, however gratifying, would make me lukewarmin devotion to my party."This speech appeared to her apposite and called for, and she departed inhigh spirits, which were illuminated by the thought that theadministration was not wholly to be trusted.On the following evening Selma went to the reception at the White House.The process of arrival was trying to her patience, for they were obligedto await their turn in the long file of carriages. She could not butapprove of the democratic character of the entertainment, which anyonewho desired to behold and shake hands with the Chief Magistrate was freeto attend. Still, it again crossed her mind that, as an official's wife,she ought to have been given precedence. Their turn to alight came atlast, and they took their places in the procession of visitors on itsway through the East room to the spot where the President and his wife,assisted by some of the ladies of the Cabinet, were submitting to theordeal of receiving the nation. There was a veritable crush, in whichthere was every variety of evening toilette, a display essentially inkeeping with the doctrines which Selma felt that she stood for. She tookoccasion to rejoice in Lyons's ear at the realization of heranticipations in this respect. At the same time she was agreeablystimulated by the belief that her wedding dress was sumptuous andstylish, and her appearance striking. Her hair had been dressed aselaborately as possible; she wore all her jewelry; and she carried abouquet of costly roses. Her wish was to regard the function as theheight of social demonstration, and she had spared no pains to makeherself effective. She had esteemed it her duty to do so both as aCongressman's wife and as a champion of moral and democratic ideas.The crowd was oppressive, and three times the train of her dress wasstepped on to her discomfiture. Amid the sea of faces she recognized afew of the people she had seen at the hotel. It struck her that no oneof the women was dressed so elegantly as herself, an observation whichcheered her and yet was not without its thorn. But the music, thelights, and the variegated movement of the scene kept her sensesabsorbed and interfered with introspection, until at last they wereclose to the receiving party. Selma fixed her eyes on the President,expecting recognition. Like her husband, the President possessed a giftof faces and the faculty of rallying all his energies to the importanttask of remembering who people were. An usher asked and announced thenames, but the Chief Magistrate's perceptions were kept hard at work.His "How do you do, Congressman Lyons? I am very glad to see you here,Mrs. Lyons," were uttered with a smiling spontaneity, which to his ownsoul meant a momentary agreeable relaxation of the nerves of memory,resembling the easy flourish with which a gymnast engaged in liftingheavy weights encounters a wooden dumb-bell. But though his eyes andvoice were flattering, Selma had barely completed the little bob of acourtesy which accompanied her act of shaking hands when she discoveredthat the machinery of the national custom was not to halt on theiraccount, and that she must proceed without being able to renew the halfflirtatious interview of the previous day. She proceeded to courtesy tothe President's wife and to the row of wives of members of the Cabinetwho were assisting. Before she could adequately observe them, she foundherself beyond and a part once more of a heterogeneous crush, thecurrent of which she aimlessly followed on her husband's arm. She wassuspicious of the device of courtesying. Why had not the President'swife and the Cabinet ladies shaken hands with her and given her anopportunity to make their acquaintance? Could it be that theadministration was aping foreign manners and adopting effete andaristocratic usages?"What do we do now?" she asked of Lyons as they drifted along."I'd like to find Horace Elton and introduce him to you. I caught aglimpse of him further on just before we reached the President. Horaceknows all the ropes and can tell us who everybody is."Selma had heard her husband refer to Horace Elton on several occasionsin terms of respectful and somewhat mysterious consideration. She hadgathered in a general way that he was a far reaching and formidablepower in matters political and financial, besides being the presidentand active organizer of the energetic corporation known as theConsumers' Gas Light Company of their own state. As they proceeded shekept her eyes on the alert for a man described by Lyons as short,heavily built, and neat looking, with small side whiskers and aclose-mouthed expression. When they were not far from the door of exitfrom the East room, some one on the edge of the procession accosted herhusband, who drew her after him in that direction. Selma found herselfin a sort of eddy occupied by half a dozen people engaged in observingthe passing show, and in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Gregory Williams.It was Mr. Williams who had diverted them. He now renewed hisacquaintance with her, exclaiming--"My wife insisted that she had metyou driving with some one she believed to be your husband. I had heardthat Congressman Lyons was on his bridal tour, and now everything isclear. Flossy, you were right as usual, and it seems that our heartycongratulations are in order to two old friends."Williams spoke with his customary contagious confidence. Selma notedthat he was stouter and that his hair was becomingly streaked with gray.Had not her attention been on the lookout for his wife she might havenoticed that his eye wore a restless, strained expression despite hisaugust banker's manner and showy gallantry. She did observe that themoment he had made way for Flossy he turned to Lyons and began to talkto him in a subdued tone under the guise of watching the procession.The two women confronted each other with spontaneous forgetfulness ofthe past. There was a shade of haughtiness in Selma's greeting. She wasprepared to respect her husband's policy and to ignore the circumstancesunder which they had parted, but she wished Flossy to understand thatthis was an act of condescension on her part as a Congressman's wife,whose important social status was beyond question. She was so thoroughlyimbued with this sense of her indisputable superiority that she readilymistook Flossy's affability for fawning; whereas that young woman'singenuous friendliness was the result of a warning sentence from Gregorywhen Selma and her husband were seen approaching--"Keep a check on yourtongue, Floss. This statesman with a beard like a goat is likely to havea political future.""I felt sure it was you the other day," Flossy said with smilingsprightliness, "but I had not heard of your marriage to Mr. Lyons.""We were married at Benham six weeks ago. We are to live in Benham. Wehave bought the house there which belonged to Mr. Parsons. We have justreturned from visiting the superb scenery of the Yosemite and the RockyMountains, and it made me prouder than ever of my country. IfCongressman Lyons had not been obliged to be present at the opening ofCongress, we should have spent our honeymoon in Europe.""Gregory and I passed last summer abroad yachting. We crossed on asteamer and had our yacht meet us there. Isn't it a jam to-night?""There seem to be a great many people. I suppose you came on from NewYork on purpose for this reception?""Mercy, no. We are staying with friends, and we hadn't intended to cometo-night. But we had been dining out and were dressed, so we thoughtwe'd drop in and show our patriotism. It's destruction to clothes, andI'm glad I haven't worn my best."Selma perceived Flossy's eye making a note of her own elaborate costume,and the disagreeable suspicion that she was overdressed reasserteditself. She had already observed that Mrs. Williams's toilette, thoughstylish, was comparatively simple. How could one be overdressed on suchan occasion? What more suitable time for an American woman to wear herchoicest apparel than when paying her respects to the President of theUnited States? She noticed that Flossy seemed unduly at her ease asthough the importance of the ceremony was lost on her, and that theygroup of people with whom Flossy had been talking and who stood a littleapart were obviously indulging in quiet mirth at the expense of some ofthose in the procession."Are the friends with whom you are staying connected with theGovernment?" Selma asked airily."Official people? Goodness, no. But I can point out to you who everybodyis, for we have been in Washington frequently during the last threesessions. Gregory has to run over here on business every now and then,and I almost always come with him. To-night is the opportunity to seethe queer people in all their glory--the woolly curiosities, as Gregorycalls them. And a sprinkling of the real celebrities too," she added.Selma's inquiry had been put with a view to satisfy herself thatFlossy's friends were mere civilians. But she was glad of an opportunityto be enlightened as to the names of her fellow-officials, though sheresented Flossy's flippant tone regarding the character of theentertainment. While she listened to the breezy, running commentary bywhich Flossy proceeded to identify for her benefit the conspicuousfigures in the procession she nursed her offended sensibilities."I should suppose," she said, taking advantage of a pause, "that on suchan occasion as this everybody worth knowing would be present."Flossy gave Selma one of her quick glances. She had not forgotten thepast, nor her discovery of the late Mrs. Littleton's real grievanceagainst her and the world. Nor did she consider that her husband'scaveat debarred her from the amusement of worrying the wife of the Hon.James O. Lyons, provided it could be done by means of the truthingenuously uttered. She said with a confidential smile--"The important and the interesting political people have otheropportunities to meet one another--at dinner parties and lesspromiscuous entertainments than this, and the Washington people haveother opportunities to meet them. Of course the President is a dear, andeveryone makes a point of attending a public reception once in a while,but this sort of thing isn't exactly an edifying society event. Forinstance, notice the woman in the pomegranate velvet with two diamondsprays in her hair. That's the wife of Senator Colman--his child wife,so they call her. She came to Washington six years ago as the wife of amember of the House from one of the wild and woolly States, and wasnotorious then in the hotel corridors on account of her ringletty ravenhair and the profusion of rings she wore. She used to make eyes at thehotel guests and romp with her husband's friends in the hotel parlors,which was the theatre of her social activities. Her husband died, and ayear ago she married old Senator Colman, old enough to be hergrandfather, and one of the very rich and influential men in the Senate.Now she has developed social ambition and is anxious to entertain. Theyhave hired a large house for the winter and are building a larger one.As Mrs. Polsen--that was her first husband's name--she was invitednowhere except to wholesale official functions like this. The wife of aUnited States Senator with plenty of money can generally attract afollowing; she is somebody. And it happens that people are amused byMrs. Cohnan's eccentricities. She still overdresses, and makes eyes, andshe nudges those who sit next her at table, but she is good-natured,says whatever comes into her head, and has a strong sense of humor. Soshe is getting on.""Getting on among society people?" said Selma drily.Flossy's eyes twinkled. "Society people is the generic name used forthem in the newspapers. I mean that she is making friends among thewomen who live in the quarter where I passed you the other day."Selma frowned. "It is not necessary, I imagine, to make friends of thatclass in order to have influence in Washington,--the best kind ofinfluence. I can readily believe that people of that sort would interestmost of our public women very little.""Very likely. I don't think you quite understand me, Mrs. Lyons, or weare talking at cross purposes. What I was trying to make clear is thatpolitical and social prominence in Washington are by no meanssynonimous. Of course everyone connected with the government whodesires to frequent Washington society and is socially available isreceived with open arms; but, if people are not socially available, itby no means follows that they are able to command social recognitionmerely because they hold political office,--except perhaps in the caseof wives of the Cabinet, of the Justices of the Supreme Court, or ofrich and influential Senators, where a woman is absolutely bent onsuccess and takes pains. I refer particularly to the wives, because asingle man, if he is reasonably presentable and ambitious, can go aboutmore or less, even if he is a little rough, for men are apt to bescarce. But the line is drawn on the women unless they are--er--reallyimportant and have to be tolerated for official reasons. Now every womanwho is not _persona grata_, as the diplomats say, anywhere else, is aptto attend the President's reception in all her finery, and that's why Isuggested that this sort of thing isn't exactly an edifying socialevent. It's amusing to come here now and then, just as it's amusing togo to a menagerie. You see what I mean, don't you?" Flossy asked, plyingher feathery fan with blithe nonchalance and looking into hercompanion's face with an innocent air."I understand perfectly. And who are these people who draw the line?""It sometimes happens," continued Flossy abstractedly, without appearingto hear this inquiry, "that they improve after they've been inWashington a few years. Take Mrs. Baker, the Secretary of the Interior'swife, receiving to-night. When her husband came to Washington threeyears ago she had the social adaptability of a solemn horse. But shepersevered and learned, and now as a Cabinet lady she unbends, and is nolonger afraid of compromising her dignity by wearing becoming clothesand smiling occasionally. But you were asking who the people are whodraw the line. The nice people here just as everywhere else; the peoplewho have been well educated and have fine sensibilities, and who believein modesty, and unselfishness and thorough ways of doing things. Youmust know the sort of people I mean. Some of them make too much of meremanners, but as a class they are able to draw the line because they drawit in favor of distinction of character as opposed to--what shall I callit?--haphazard custom-made ethics and social deportment."Flossy spoke with the artless prattle of one seeking to make herselfagreeable to a new-comer by explaining the existing order of things, butshe had chosen her words as she proceeded with special reference to herlistener's case. There was nothing in her manner to suggest that she wastrifling with the feelings of the wife of Hon. James O. Lyons, but toSelma's sensitive ear there was no doubt that the impertinent andunpatriotic tirade had been deliberately aimed at her. The closing wordshad a disagreeably familiar sound. Save that they fell from seeminglyfriendly lips they recalled the ban which Flossy had hurled at her atthe close of their last meeting--the ban which had decided her todeclare unwavering hostility against social exclusiveness. Its veiledreiteration now made her nerves tingle, but the personal affront stirredher less than the conclusion, which the whole of Flossy's commentarysuggested, that Washington--Washington the hearth-stone of Americanideals, was contaminated also. Flossy had given her to understand thatthe houses which she had assumed to be occupied by members of theGovernment were chiefly the residences of people resembling in characterthose whom she had disapproved of in New York. Flossy had intimated thatunless a woman were hand in glove with these people and ready to lowerherself to their standards, she must be the wife of a rich Senator to betolerated. Flossy had virtually told her that a Congressman's wife wasnobody. Could this be true? The bitterest part of all was that it wasevident Flossy spoke with the assurance of one uttering familiar truths.Selma felt affronted and bitterly disappointed, but she chose to meetMrs. Williams's innocent affability with composure; to let her see thatshe disagreed with her, but not to reveal her personal irritation. Shemust consider Lyons, whose swift political promotion was necessary forher plans. It was important that he should become rich, and if hisrelations with the firm of Williams & Van Horne tended to that end, nopersonal grievance of her own should disturb them. Even Flossy hadconceded that the wives of the highest officials could not be ignored."I fear that we look at these matters from too different a standpoint todiscuss them further," she responded, with an effort at smiling ease."Evidently you do not appreciate that to the majority of the strongwomen of the country whose husbands have been sent to Washington asmembers of the Government social interests seem trivial compared withthe great public questions they are required to consider. These womendoubtless feel little inclination for fashionable and--or--frivolousfestivities, and find an occasion like this better suited to theirconception of social dignity."A reply by Flossy to this speech was prevented by the interruption ofLyons, who brought up Mr. Horace Elton for introduction to his wife.Selma knew him at once from his likeness to the description which herhusband had given. He was portly and thick-set, with a large neck, astrong, unemotional, high-colored face, and closely-shaven, small sidewhiskers. He made her a low bow and, after a few moments ofconversation, in the course of which he let fall a complimentaryallusion to her husband's oratorical abilities and gave her tounderstand that he considered Lyons's marriage as a wise and enviableproceeding, he invited her to promenade the room on his arm. Mr. Eltonhad a low but clear and dispassionate voice, and a concise utterance.His remarks gave the impression that he could impart more on any subjectif he chose, and that what he said proceeded from a reserve fund ofspecial, secret knowledge, a little of which he was willing to confideto his listener. He enlightened Selma in a few words as to a variety ofthe people present, accompanying his identification with a phrase or twoof comprehensive personal detail, which had the savor of being unknownto the world at large."The lady we just passed, Mrs. Lyons, is the wife of the junior Senatorfrom Nevada. Her husband fell in love with her on the stage of a miningtown theatrical troupe. That tall man, with the profuse wavy hair andprominent nose, is Congressman Ross of Colorado, the owner of one of thelargest cattle ranches in the Far West. It is said that he has neversmoked, never tasted a glass of liquor, and never gambled in his life."In the course of these remarks Mr. Elton simply stated his interestingfacts without comment. He avoided censorious or satirical allusions tothe people to whom he called Selma's attention. On the contrary, hisobservations suggested sympathetically that he desired to point out toher the interesting personalities of the capital, and that he regardedthe entertainment as an occasion to behold the strong men and women ofthe country in their lustre and dignity. As they passed the lady inpomegranate velvet, Selma said, in her turn, "That is Mrs. Colman, Ibelieve. Senator Colman's child wife." She added what was in herthoughts, "I understand that the society people here have taken her up.""Yes. She has become a conspicuous figure in Washington. I remember her,Mrs. Lyons, when she was Addie Farr--before she married CongressmanPolsen of Kentucky. She was a dashing looking girl in those days, withher black eyes and black ringlets. I remember she had a coltish way oftossing her head. The story is that when she accepted Polsen anotherKentuckian--a young planter--who was in love with her, drank laudanum.Now, as you say, she is being taken up socially, and her husband, theSenator, is very proud of her success. After all, if a woman isambitious and has tact, what can she ask better than to be the wife of aUnited States Senator?" He paused a moment, then, with a gallantsidelong glance at his companion, resumed in a concise whisper, whichhad the effect of a disclosure, "Prophecies, especially politicalprophecies, are dangerous affairs, but it seems to me not improbablethat before many years have passed the wife of Senator Lyons will beequally prominent--be as conspicuous socially as the wife of SenatorColman."Selma blushed, but not wholly with pleasure. Socially conspicuous beforemany years? The splendid prophecy, which went beyond the limit of HoraceElton's usual caution--for he combined the faculty of habitualdiscretion with his chatty proclivities--was dimmed for Selma by therasping intimation that she was not conspicuous yet. Worse still, hisstatement shattered the hope, which Flossy's fluent assertions hadalready disturbed, that she was to find in Washington a company ofcongenial spirits who would appreciate her at her full value forthwith,and would join with her and under her leadership in resisting theencroachments of women of the stamp of Mrs. Williams."I am very ambitious for my husband, Mr. Elton, and of course I havehoped--do hope that some day he will be a Senator. What you said justnow as to the power of his voice to arouse the moral enthusiasm of thepeople seemed to be impressively true. I should be glad to be aSenator's wife, for--for I wish to help him. I wish to demonstrate thetruth of the principles to which both our lives are dedicated. But Ihoped that I might help him now--that my mission might be clear at once.It seems according to you that a Congressman's wife is not of muchimportance; that her hands are tied.""Practically so, unless--unless she has unusual social facility, and theright sort of acquaintances. Beauty, wealth and ambition are valuableaids, but I always am sorry for women who come here without friends,and--er--the right sort of introduction. At any rate, to answer yourquestion frankly, a Congressman's wife has her spurs to win just as hehas. If you were to set up house-keeping, here, Mrs. Lyons, I've nodoubt that a woman of your attractions and capabilities would soon makea niche for herself. You have had social experience, which Addie Farr,for instance, was without.""I lived in New York for some years with my husband, Mr. Littleton, so Ihave a number of Eastern acquaintances.""I remember you were talking with Mrs. Gregory Williams when I wasintroduced to you. The people with whom she is staying are among themost fashionable in Washington. What I said had reference to the wife ofthe every-day Congressman who comes to Washington expecting recognition.Not to Mrs. James O. Lyons."Selma bit her lip. She recognized the death-knell of her cherishedexpectations. She was not prepared to acknowledge formally herdiscomfiture and her disappointment. But she believed that Mr. Elton,though a plain man, had comprehensive experience and that he spoke withshrewd knowledge of the situation. She felt sure that he was not tryingto deceive or humiliate her. It was clear that Washington wascontaminated also."I dare say I should get on here well enough after a time, though Ishould find difficulty in considering that it was right to give so muchtime to merely social matters. But Mr. Lyons and I have already decidedthat I can be more use to him at present in Benham. There I feel athome. I am known, and have my friends, and there I have importantwork--literary lectures and the establishment of a large public hospitalunder way. If the time comes, as you kindly predict, that my husband ischosen a United States Senator, I shall be glad to return here andaccept the responsibilities of our position. But I warn you, Mr.Elton,--I warn the people of Washington," she added with a wave of herfan, while her eyes sparkled with a stern light "that when I am one oftheir leaders, I shall do away with some of the--er--false customs ofthe present administration. I shall insist on preserving our Americansocial traditions inviolate."Here was the grain of consolation in the case, which she clutched at andheld up before her mind's eye as a new stimulus to her patriotism andher conscience. Both Mr. Elton and Flossy had indicated that there was apoint at which exclusiveness was compelled to stop in its haughtydisregard of democratic ideals. There were certain women whom the peoplewho worshipped lack of enthusiasm and made an idol of cynicism wereobliged to heed and recognize. They might be able to ignore theintelligence and social originality of a Congressman's wife, but theydared not turn a cold shoulder on the wife of a United States Senator.And if a woman--if she were to occupy this proud position, what asatisfaction it would be to assert the power which belonged to it;assert it in behalf of the cause for which she had suffered so much! Herdisappointment tasted bitterly in her mouth, and she was conscious ofstern revolt; but the new hope had already taken possession of herfancy, and she hastened to prove it by the ethical standard withoutwhich all hopes were valueless to her. Even now had anyone told her thatthe ruling passion of her life was to be wooed and made much of by thevery people she professed to despise, she would have spurned the accuseras a malicious slanderer. Nor indeed would it have been wholly true.Mrs. Williams had practically told her this at their last meeting in NewYork, and its utterance had convinced her on the contrary of repugnanceto them, and of her desire to be the leader of a social protest againstthem. Now here, in Washington of all places, she was confronted by thebitter suggestion that she was without allies, and that her enemies werethe keepers of the door which led to leadership and power. Despondencystared her in the face, but a splendid possibility--aye probability wasleft. She would not forsake her principles. She would not lower herflag. She would return to Benham. Washington refused her homage now, butit should listen to her and bow before her some day as the wife of oneof the real leaders of the State, whom Society did not dare to ignore.CHAPTER VII.At the close of the fortnight of her stay in Washington subsequent tothe reception at the White House, Selma found herself in the same frameof mind as when she parted from Mr. Elton. During this fortnight hertime was spent either in sight seeing or at the hotel. The exercises atthe Capitol were purely formal, preliminary to a speedy adjournment ofCongress. Consequently her husband had no opportunity to distinguishhimself by addressing the house. Of Flossy she saw nothing, though thetwo men had several meetings. Apparently both Lyons and Williams werecontent with a surface reconciliation between their wives which did notbar family intercourse. At least her husband made no suggestion that sheshould call on Mrs. Williams, and Flossy's cards did not appear. Beyondmaking the acquaintance of a few more wives and daughters in the hotel,who seemed as solitary as herself, Selma received no overtures from herown sex. She knew no one, and no one sought her out or paid herattention. She still saw fit to believe that if she were to establishherself in Washington and devote her energies to rallying these wivesand daughters about her, she might be able to prove that Flossy and Mr.Elton were mistaken. But she realized that the task would be less simplethan she had anticipated. Besides she yearned to return to Benham, andtake up again the thread of active life there. Benham would vindicateher, and some day Benham would send her back to Washington to claimrecognition and her rightful place.Lyons himself was in a cheerful mood and found congenial occupation invisiting with his wife the many historical objects of interest, and inchatting in various hotel corridors with the public men of the country,his associates in Congress. His solicitude in regard to the accountwhich Williams was carrying for him had been relieved temporarily by anupward turn in the stock market, and the impending prompt adjournment ofCongress had saved him from the necessity of taking action in regard tothe railroad bill which Williams had solicited him to support. MoreoverSelma had repeated to him Horace Elton's prophecy that it was notunlikely that some day he would become Senator. To be sure he recognizedthat a remark like this uttered to a pretty woman by an astute man ofaffairs such as Elton was not to be taken too seriously. There was novacancy in the office of Senator from his state, and none was likely tooccur. At the present time, if one should occur, his party in the statelegislature was in a minority. Hence prophecy was obviously a randomproceeding. Nevertheless he was greatly pleased, for, after all, Eltonwould scarcely have made the speech had he not been genuinely welldisposed. A senatorship was one of the great prizes of political life,and one of the noblest positions in the world. It would afford him agolden opportunity to leave the impress of his convictions on nationallegislation, and defend the liberties of the people by force of theoratorical gifts which he possessed. Elton had referred to these giftsin complimentary terms. Was it not reasonable to infer that Elton wouldbe inclined to promote his political fortunes? Such an ally would beinvaluable, for Elton was a growing power in the industrial developmentof the section of the country where they both lived. He had continued tofind him friendly in spite of his own antagonism on the public platformto corporate power. A favorite and conscientious hope in his politicaloutlook was that he might be able to make capital as well as laborbelieve him to be a friend without alienating either; that he mightobtain support at the polls from both factions, and thus be left freeafter election to work out for their mutual advantage appropriatelegislation. He had avowed himself unmistakably the champion of popularprinciples in order to win the confidence of the common people, but hispolicy of reasonable conciliation led him to cast sheep's eyes at vestedinterests when he could do so without exposing himself to the charge ofinconsistency. Many of his friends were wealthy men, and his privateambition was to amass a handsome fortune. That had been the cause of hisspeculative ventures in local enterprises which promised large returns,and in the stock market. Horace Elton was a friend of but three years'standing; one of the men who had consulted him occasionally in regard tolegal matters since he had become a corporation attorney. He admiredElton's strong, far-reaching grasp of business affairs, his capacity toformulate and incubate on plans of magnitude without betraying a sign ofhis intentions, and his power to act with lightning despatch andoverwhelming vigor when the moment for the consummation of his purposesarrived. He also found agreeable Elton's genial, easy-going ways outsideof business hours, which frequently took the form of socialentertainment at which expense seemed to be no consideration andgastronomic novelties were apt to be presented. Lyons attended one ofthese private banquets while in Washington--a dinner party served to acarefully chosen company of public men, to which newspaper scribes wereunable to penetrate. This same genial, easy-going tendency of Elton's tomake himself acceptable to those with whom he came in contact took theform of a gift to Mrs. Lyons of a handsome cameo pin which he presentedto her a day or two after their dialogue at the President's reception,and for which, as he confidentially informed Selma, he had been seekinga suitable wearer ever since he had picked it up in an out-of-the-waystore in Brussels the previous summer.On the day of their departure Selma, as she took a last look from thecar window at the Capitol and the Washington Monument, said to herhusband: "This is a beautiful city--worthy in many respects of thegenius of the American people--but I never wish to return to Washingtonuntil you are United States Senator.""Would you not be satisfied with Justice of the Supreme Court?" askedLyons, gayly."I should prefer Senator. If you were Senator, you could probably beappointed to the Supreme Court in case you preferred that place. I amrelying on you, James, to bring me back here some day."She whispered this in his ear, as they sat with heads close togetherlooking back at the swiftly receding city. Selma's hands were clasped inher lap, and she seemed to her lover to have a dreamy air--an airsuggesting poetry and high ethical resolve such as he liked to associatewith her and their scheme of wedded life. It pleased him that his wifeshould feel so confident that the future had in store for him this greatprize, and he allowed himself to yield to the pathos of the moment andwhisper in reply:"I will say this, Selma. My business affairs look more favorable, and,if nothing unforeseen happens, I do not see why we shouldn't get onreasonably fast. Nowadays, in order to be a United States Senatorcomfortably, it is desirable in the first place to have abundant means.""Yes.""We must be patient and God-fearing, and with your help, dear, and yoursympathy, we may live to see what you desire come to pass. Of course, myambition is to be Senator, and--and to take you back to Washington as aSenator's wife."Selma had not chosen to confide to Lyons in set terms her socialgrievance against the capital of her country. But she was glad toperceive from his last words that he understood she was not satisfiedwith the treatment accorded her, and that he also was looking forward togiving her a position which would enable her to rebuke the ungodly andpresumptuous."Thank you, James," she answered. "When that time comes we shall be ableto teach them a number of things. For the present though, I feel that Ican be of best service to you and to the truths which we are living forby interesting myself in whatever concerns Benham. We believe in Benham,and Benham seems inclined to believe in us and our ideas."The ensuing year passed uneventfully. Lyons was able to be at home fromthe first of April to the reassembling of Congress in the followingDecember. He was glad to give himself up to the enjoyment of hishandsome establishment. He resumed the tenor of his professionalpractice, feeling that as a sober-minded, married citizen he had becomeof more importance to the community, and he was eager to bear witness tohis sense of responsibility. He took a more active part in solicitingcontributions for evangelizing benighted countries, and he consented onseveral occasions to deliver an address on "Success in Life" tostruggling young men of Benham and the surrounding towns. His easy flowof words, his dignity and his sober but friendly mien made him afavorite with audiences, and constantly broadened his circle ofacquaintance.Selma, on her side, took up the organization of the Free Hospitalprovided by Mr. Parsons. Her husband left the decision of all but legaland financial questions to her and Miss Luella Bailey, who, at Selma'srequest, was made the third member of the board of trustees. She decidedto call in a committee of prominent physicians to formulate a programmeof procedure in matters purely medical; but she reserved a right ofrejection of their conclusions, and she insisted on the recognition ofcertain cardinal principles, as she called them. She specified that noone school of medicine should dictate the policy of the hospital asregards the treatment of patients. To the young physician whom sheselected to assist her in forming this administrative board she stated,with stern emotion: "I do not intend that it shall be possible in thishospital for men and women to be sacrificed simply because doctors areunwilling to avail themselves of the latest resources of brilliantindividual discernment. I know what it means to see a beloved one die,who might have been saved had the physician in charge been willing totry new expedients. The doors of this hospital must be ever open torising unconventional talent. There shall be no creeds nor caste ofmedicine here."She also specified that the matron in charge of the hospital should beMrs. Earle, whose lack of trained experience was more thancounterbalanced by her maternal, humanitarian spirit, as Selma expressedit. She felt confident that Mrs. Earle would choose as her assistantscompetent and skilful persons, and at the same time that her broad pointof view and sympathetic instincts would not allow her to turn a deaf earto aspiring but technically ignorant ability. This selection of Mrs.Earle was a keen pleasure to Selma. It seemed to her an ideal selection.Mrs. Earle was no longer young, and was beginning to find the constantlabor of lecture and newspaper work exhausting. This dignified andimportant post would provide her with a permanent income, and wouldafford her an attractive field for her progressive capabilities.Selma's choice of young Dr. Ashmun as the head of the medical board wasdue to a statement which came to her ears, that he was reviled by someof the physicians of Benham because he had patented certain discoveriesof his own instead of giving his fellow-practitioners the benefit of hisknowledge. Selma was prompt to detect in this hostility an enviousdisposition on the part of the regular physicians to appropriate thefruits of individual cleverness and to repress youthful revolt againstconventional methods. Dr. Ashmun regarded his selection as theprofessional chief of this new institution as a most auspiciousoccurrence from the standpoint of his personal fortunes. He wasambitious, ardent, and keen to attract attention, with an abundant fundof energy and a nervous, driving manner. He was, besides, good lookingand fluent, and he quickly perceived the drift of Selma's intentions inregard to the hospital, and accommodated himself to them withenthusiasm. They afforded him the very opportunity which he mostdesired--the chance to assert himself against his critics, and to obtainpublic notice. The watchword of liberty and distrust of professionalcanons suited his purposes and his mood, and he threw himself eagerlyinto the work of carrying out Selma's projects.As a result of the selection of Dr. Ashmun and of the other members ofthe administrative board, who were chosen with a view to theiravailability as sympathetic colleagues, letters of protest from severalphysicians appeared in the newspapers complaining that the new hospitalwas being conducted on unscientific and shallow principles, disapprovedof by the leading men of the profession. Selma was indignant yetthrilled. She promptly took steps to refute the charge, and explainedthat the hostility of these correspondents proceeded from envy andhide-bound reluctance to adopt new and revolutionizing expedients.Through the aid of Mrs. Earle and Miss Luella Bailey a double-leadedcolumn in the Benham _Sentinel_ set forth the merits of the newdeparture in medicine, which was cleverly described as the revolt of thetalented young men of the profession from the tyranny of theirconservative elders. Benham became divided in opinion as to the meritsof this controversy, and Selma received a number of anonymous lettersthrough the post approving her stand in behalf of advanced, independentthought. Among the physicians who were opposed to her administration ofthe hospital she recognized with satisfaction the name of a Dr. Paget,who, as she happened to know, was Mrs. Hallett Taylor's medical adviser.Another matter in which Selma became interested was the case of Mrs.Hamilton. She was a woman who had been born in the neighborhood ofBenham, but had lived for twenty years in England, and had been tried inEngland by due process of law for the murder of her husband andsentenced to imprisonment for life. Some of the people of the state whohad followed the testimony as reported in the American newspapers haddecided that she ought not to have been convicted. Accordingly apetition setting forth the opinion of her former neighbors that she wasinnocent of the charge, and should as an American citizen be releasedfrom custody, was circulated for signature. A public meeting was heldand largely attended, at which it was resolved to send a monsterpetition to the British authorities with a request for Mrs. Hamilton'spardon, and also to ask the government at Washington to intercede onbehalf of the unfortunate sufferer. The statement of the case appealedvividly to Selma, and at the public meeting, which was attended chieflyby women, she spoke, and offered the services of her husband to lay thematter before the President. It was further resolved to obtain the namesof influential persons all over the country in order that the petitionmight show that the sentiment that injustice had been done was nationalas well as local.Selma espoused the case with ardor, and busied herself in obtainingsignatures. She called on Miss Flagg and induced her to sign by theassurance that the verdict was entirely contrary to the evidence. Shethen had recourse to her former sister-in-law, conceiving that thesignature of the President of Wetmore College would impress the English.She and Pauline had already exchanged visits, and Pauline had shown noumbrage at her marriage. The possibility of being rebuffed on thisoccasion did not occur to Selma. She took for granted that Pauline wouldbe only too glad to give her support to so deserving a petition, and sheconsidered that she was paying her a compliment in soliciting her namefor insertion among the prominent signers. Pauline listened to herattentively, then replied:"I am sorry for the woman, if she is innocent: and if she has beenfalsely accused, of course she ought to be released. But what makes youthink she is innocent, Selma?""The testimony did not justify her conviction. Every one is of thatopinion.""Have you read the testimony yourself, Selma?""No, Pauline.""Or your husband?""My husband is satisfied from what others have told him, just as I am,that this poor American woman is languishing in prison as the result ofa cruel miscarriage of justice, and that she never committed the crimeof which she has been found guilty. My husband has had considerablelegal experience."Pauline's questions were nettling, and Selma intended by her response tosuggest the presumptuousness of her sister-in-law's doubts in the faceof competent authority."I realize that your husband ought to understand about such matters, butmay one suppose that the English authorities would deliberately allow aninnocent woman to remain in prison? They must know that the friends ofMrs. Hamilton believe her innocent. Why should we on this side of thewater meddle simply because she was born an American?""Why?" Selma drew herself up proudly. "In the first place I believe--webelieve--that the English are capable of keeping her in prison on atechnicality merely because she is there already. They are worshippersof legal form and red tape, my husband says. And as to meddling, why isit not our duty as an earnest and Christian people to remonstrateagainst the continued incarceration of a woman born under our flag andaccustomed to American ideas of justice? Meddling? In my opinion, weshould be cowards and derelict in our duty if we did not protest."Pauline shook her head. "I cannot see it so. It seems to me aninterference which may make us seem ridiculous in the eyes of theEnglish, as well as offensive to them. I am sorry, Selma, not to be ableto do as you wish."Selma rose with burning cheeks, but a stately air. "If that is yourdecision, I must do without your name. Already we have many signatures,and shall obtain hundreds more without difficulty. We look at thingsdifferently, Pauline. Our point of view has never been the same.Ridiculous? I should be proud of the ridicule of people too selfish ortoo unenlightened to heed the outcry of aspiring humanity. If we had todepend on your little set to strike the note of progress, I fear weshould sit with folded hands most of the time.""I do not know what you mean by my little set," said Pauline with asmile. "I am too busy with my college duties to belong to any set. I seemy friends occasionally just as you see yours; and as to progress--well,I fear that you are right in your statement that we shall never look atthings alike. To me progress presupposes in the individual or thecommunity attaining it a prelude of slow struggle, disheartening doubts,and modest reverence for previous results--for the accumulated wisdom ofthe past.""I mean by your set the people who think as you do. I understand yourpoint of view. I should have liked," she added, "to ask you to sharewith me the responsibility of directing the policy of the Benham FreeHospital, had I not known that you would listen to the voice ofconservative authority in preference to that of fearless innovation.""I certainly should have hesitated long before I overruled theexperience of those who have devoted their lives to conscientious effortto discover truth.""That illustrates admirably the difference between us, Pauline. No oneis more eager to aid the discovery of truth than I, but I believe thattruth often is concealed from those who go on, day after day, followinghum-drum routine, however conscientious. I recognized that Dr. Ashmunwas a live man and had fresh ideas, so I chose him as our chief ofstaff, notwithstanding the doctors were unfriendly to him. As a result,my hospital has individuality, and is already a success. That's the sortof thing I mean. Good-by," she said, putting out her hand. "I don'texpect to convert you, Pauline, to look at things my way, but you mustrealize by this time that it is the Benham way.""Yet the leading physicians of Benham disapprove of your plans for themanagement of the hospital," said Pauline firmly."But the people of Benham approve of them. I prefer their sanction tothat of a coterie of cautious, unenthusiastic autocrats."Selma, true to her intentions, did not return to Washington with herhusband when Congress reassembled in December. While she was absorbedwith her philanthropic plans in Benham, Lyons was performing his publicduties; seeking to do the country good service, and at the right momentto attract attention to himself. The opportunity to make a speech alongthe line of his public professions in behalf of labor against corporatemonopoly did not offer itself until late in the session. He improved thefew minutes allowed him to such advantage that he was listened to withclose attention, and was at once recognized as one of the persuasive andeloquent speakers of the minority. Before Congress adjourned he obtainedanother chance to take part in debate, by which he produced an equallyfavorable impression. The newspapers of the country referred approvinglyto his cogent gift of statement and dignified style of delivery. Boththe bills against which he spoke were passed by the Republican majority,but echoes of his words came back from some of their constituents, andLyons was referred to as certain to be one of the strong men of theHouse if he returned to Congress. He went home at the close of thesession in a contented frame of mind so far as his political prospectswere concerned, but he was not free to enjoy the congratulationsaccorded him for the reason that his business ventures were beginning togive him serious solicitude. The trend of the stock market was againdownward. In expectation of a rise from the previous depression, he hadadded to the line of shares which Williams & Van Horne were carrying forhim. A slight rise had come, sufficient to afford him a chance to escapefrom the toils of Wall street without loss. But he needed a profit torehabilitate his ventures in other directions--his investments in theenterprises of his own state, which had now for some months appearedquiescent, if not languishing, from a speculative point of view.Everything pointed, it was said, to a further advance as soon asCongress adjourned. So he had waited, and now, although the session wasover, the stock market and financial undertakings of every sort appearedsuddenly to be tottering. He had not been at home a month before pricesof all securities began to shrink inordinately and the business horizonto grow murky with the clouds of impending disaster. To add to hisworry, Lyons was conscious that he had pursued a fast and loose mentalcoarse in regard to the railroad bill in which his broker, Williams, wasinterested. He had given Williams to understand that he would try to seehis way to support it; yet in view of his late prominence in Washington,as a foe of legislation in behalf of moneyed interests, he was more thanever averse to casting a vote in its favor. The bill had not beenreached before adjournment, a result to which he had secretlycontributed, but it was certain to be called up shortly after Congressreassembled. It disturbed him to feel that his affairs in New York werein such shape that Williams could embarrass him financially if he chose.It disturbed him still more that he appeared to himself to be guilty ofbad faith. His conscience was troubled, and his favorite palliative ofconciliation did not seem applicable to the case.CHAPTER VIII.Until this time the course of financial events in Benham since itsevolution from a sleepy country town began had been steadily prosperous.There had been temporary recessions in prices, transient haltings in thetendency of new local undertakings to double and quadruple in value. Afew rash individuals, indeed, had been forced to suspend payments andcompound with their creditors. But there had been no real set back tocommercial enthusiasm and speculative gusto. Those who desired to borrowmoney for progressive enterprises had found the banks accommodating andunsuspicious, and to Benham initiative it yet appeared that thedevelopment of the resources of the neighborhood by the unwearying,masterful energy of the citizens was still in its infancy.But now, after a few months of inactivity, which holders of speculativesecurities had spoken of as another healthy breathing spell, thetendency of prices had changed. Had not merely halted, but showed aradical tendency to shrink; even to tumble feverishly. Buyers werescarce, and the once accommodating banks displayed a heartlessdisposition to scrutinize collateral and to ask embarrassing questionsin regard to commercial paper. Rates of interest on loans wereruthlessly advanced, and additional security demanded. A pall ofdejection hung over Benham. Evil days had come; days the fruit of a longperiod of inflation. A dozen leading firms failed and carried down withthem diverse small people. Amid the general distrust and anxiety alleyes were fixed on Wall street, the so-called money centre of thecountry, the Gehenna where this cyclone had first manifested itself. Thenewspapers, voicing Benham public opinion, cast vituperation at thebankers and brokers of Wall street, whose unholy jugglings with fortunehad brought this commercial blight on the community. Wall street hadlocked up money; consequently funds were tight in Benham, and the plansof its honest burghers to promote enterprise and develop the lawfulindustries of the country were interrupted. So spoke public opinion,and, at the same time, hundreds of private letters were being despatchedthrough the Benham Post Office in response to requests for more marginson stocks held for the honest burghers by the fraternity of Wall streetgamblers. There was private wailing and gnashing of teeth also, for inthe panic a few of these bankers and brokers had been submerged, and thecollateral of Benham's leading citizens had been swept away.The panic itself was brief as panics always are, but it left behind iteverywhere a paralyzed community. So far as Benham was concerned, only afew actually failed, but, in a host of instances, possessors of propertywho had thought themselves wealthy a year before found that they wereface to face with the knotty problem of nursing their dwarfed resourcesso as to avoid eventual insolvency. Everything had shrunk fifty--oftenone hundred--per cent., for the basis of Benham's semi-fabulousdevelopment had been borrowed money. Many of Benham's leading citizenswere down to hard pan, so to speak. Their inchoate enterprises werebeing carried by the banks on the smallest margins consistent with thesolvency of those institutions, and clear-headed men knew that months ofrecuperation must elapse before speculative properties would show lifeagain. Benham was consequently gloomy for once in despite of its nativebuoyancy. It would have arisen from the ashes of a fire as strenuous asa young lion. But, with everybody's stocks and merchandise pledged tothe money lenders, enterprise was gripped by the throat. In the pride ofits prosperity Benham had dreamed that it was a law unto itself, andthat even Wall street could not affect its rosy commercial destinies. Itappeared to pious owners of securities almost as though God had desertedhis chosen city of a chosen country.Lyons was among those upon whom the harrow of this fall in prices andsubsequent hand-to-mouth struggle with the banks pressed with unpleasantrigor. In business phraseology he was too much extended. Consequently,as the margins of value of the securities on which he had borroweddropped away, he was kept on tenter-hooks as to the future. In case theprocess of shrinkage went much further, he would be required to supplymore collateral; and, if the rate of money did not fall, the banks wouldrefuse to renew his notes as they became due, unless he could furnishclear evidence of his solvency. He was owing over one hundred and fiftythousand dollars on paper secured only by the stock and bonds ofbrand-new enterprises, which had no market negotiability. From the moneywhich he had borrowed he had sent, from time to time, to Williams andVan Horne an aggregate of forty thousand dollars to protect some twothousand shares of railroad stocks. Williams had especially commendedthe shares of the coal-carrying roads to his attention, and the drop inprices had been uniformly severe in these properties. Instead of beingthe possessor of a stable quarter of a million, which he considered tobe the value of his property at the time of his election to Congress,Lyons suddenly realized that he was on the brink of a serious financialcollapse through which he might lose everything before he coulddischarge his liabilities. It seemed cruel to him, for he believed thatall his ventures were sound, and that if he were not forced to sacrificehis possessions, their future value would attest his sagacity. But atpresent the securities of speculative enterprises were practicallyworthless as procurers of ready money. The extreme circumstances hadcome upon him with startling rapidity, so that he found himself in theunpleasant predicament of having used for temporary relief some of thebonds belonging to the Parsons estate which he held as executor. He hadforwarded these to Williams merely as a matter of convenience before hehad become anxious, expecting to be able to replace them with fundscoming to him within thirty days from a piece of real estate for whichhe had received an offer. He had held off in the hope of obtaining ahigher price. The following week, when signs of danger were multiplying,he had found the would-be purchaser unwilling to buy at any price.Realizing the compromising position in which he had placed himself byhis action, he had cast about feverishly for the means to redeem thehypothecated securities, but all his resources were taxed of a sudden bythe advent of the panic. It occurred to him to ask Selma to allowsubstitution of the twenty thousand dollars, which had been apportioned,to her as her legacy, for the bonds, but at first he had shrunk from themortification of disclosing his condition to her, and now that thesituation had developed, he feared that he might be obliged to borrowthis money from her for the protection of his other interests. It gavehim sore concern that he, a champion of moral ideas, a leading churchmember, and a Representative of the Federal Government should be put insuch an equivocal position. Here again there was no opportunity forconciliation, and dignified urbanity was of no avail. If the conditionof drooping prices and general distrust, a sort of commercial dry-rot,which had succeeded the panic, continued much longer he would be drivento the wall unless relief were forthcoming. Nor was it much consolationthat many others were on the verge of failure. Financial insolvency forhim would mean the probable loss of his seat in Congress, and theserious interruption of his political career. From what source could hehope for relief? The preparations for the autumn campaign were alreadybeing considered, and there was likelihood of another close contestbetween the two political parties. But for the worry occasioned by hisplight, he would have resumed the contest with hopeful ardor,appreciating that the pecuniary distress of the community would belikely to work to his advantage. His own nomination was assured; hisre-election appeared probable. But after it what could he expect but thedeluge?One source of the effectiveness of Horace Elton was that he was wont toexercise foresight, and make his plans in advance while other men wereslumbering. He had been prepared for the panic because he had beenexpecting it for more than a year, and the ship of his financialfortunes was close reefed to meet the fury of the overdue gale. Also hewas quick to recognize that the wide-spread depreciation of values wouldinevitably be followed by a period of business inactivity which wouldthrow out of employment a large number of wage earners whose ballots asa consequence would be cast against the political party in power. As farback as the time when he made the acquaintance of Selma at Washingtonand selected her as the wearer of his cameo pin, he had been incubatingon a scheme for the consolidation of the gas companies in the cities andtowns of the state into one large corporation. For this corporation herequired a liberal charter, which the next legislature would be invitedto grant. He expected to be able to procure this franchise from thelegislature, but he judged that the majority in favor of the bill wouldnot be large enough to pass it over the Governor's veto. Accordingly itwas of the first importance that the Governor should be friendly to themeasure.This was the year of the Presidential election. Both political partieswere seeking to nominate their strongest candidates for the variousfederal and state offices. A promoter of large business schemes was at adisadvantage in a campaign where party feelings ran high and nationalissues were involved, and Elton knew it. He commonly chose an off yearin politics for the consummation of his business deals. But he hadchosen to push his bill this year for the reason that he wished to be ina position to buy out the sub-companies cheaply. The community waspressed for ready money, and many men who would be slow in prosperoustimes to extract gas shares from their tin boxes and stockings would beglad to avail themselves of a reasonable cash offer. Elton was aRepublican on national issues. His experience had been that theRepublican Party was fundamentally friendly to corporations, in spite ofoccasional pious ejaculations in party platforms to the contrary. He hada Republican candidate for Governor in mind who would be faithful to hisinterests; but this candidate was put aside in the convention indeference to the sentiment that only a man of first-rate mental andmoral calibre could command the allegiance of independent voters, whoseco-operation seemed essential to party success. The Republican stateconvention was held three weeks prior to the date fixed for that oftheir opponents. Within twenty-four hours subsequent to the nominationof Hon. John Patterson as the Republican candidate for Governor, whilethe party organs were congratulating the public on his selection, andthe leaders of the party were endeavoring to suppress the murmurs of thedisappointed lower order of politicians who, in metaphorical phrase,felt that they were sewed up in a sack for another two years by thechoice of this strong citizen, one of the most widely circulateddemocratic newspapers announced in large type on its front page thatHon. James O. Lyons was the only Democrat who could defeat him in thegubernatorial contest. Behind the ledger sheet of this newspaper--whichwas no other than the Benham _Sentinel_--lurked the keen intelligence ofHorace Elton. He knew that the candidate of his own party would neverconsent to indicate in advance what his action on the gas bill would be,and that he would only prejudice his chances of obtaining favorableaction when the time arrived by any attempt to forestall a decision.This did not suit Horace Elton. He was accustomed to be able to obtainan inkling before election that legislation in which he was interestedwould not encounter a veto. His measures were never dishonest. That is,he never sought to foist bogus or fraudulent undertakings upon thecommunity. He was seeking, to be sure, eventual emolument for himself,but he believed that the franchise which he was anxious to obtain wouldresult in more progressive and more effectual public service. He hadnever before felt obliged to refrain from asking direct or indirectassurance that his plans would be respected by the Governor. Yet he hadforeseen the possibility of just such an occurrence. The one chance in ahundred had happened and he was ready for it. He intended to contributeto the Republican national campaign fund, but he did not feel that theinterests of his State would suffer if he used all the influences at hiscommand to secure a Governor who would be friendly to his scheme, andCongressman Lyons appeared to him the most available man for hispurpose.It had already occurred to Lyons that his nomination as Governor was apossibility, for the leaders of the party were ostensibly looking aboutfor a desirable Democrat with whom to confront Patterson, and had shownan intention to turn a cold shoulder on the ambition of severalaspirants for this honor who might have been encouraged in an ordinaryyear as probable victors. He knew that his name was under consideration,and he had made up his mind that he would accept the nomination if itwere offered to him. He would regret the interruption of hisCongressional career, but he felt that his election as Governor in apresidential year after a close contest would make him the leader of theparty in the State, and, in case the candidate of his party were chosenPresident, would entitle him to important recognition from the newadministration. Moreover, if he became Governor, his financial statuswould be strengthened. The banks would be more likely to accommodate onein such a powerful position, and he might be able to keep his head abovewater until better times brought about a return of public confidence anda recovery in prices. Yet he felt by no means sure that even as Governorhe could escape betraying his financial embarrassment, and his mind wasso oppressed by the predicament in which he found himself that he madeno effort on his own part to cause the party leaders to fix their choiceon him. Nor did he mention the possibility of his selection to Selma.Mortification and self-reproach had made him for the moment inert as tohis political future, and reluctant to confide his troubles to her.The clarion declaration of the Benham _Sentinel_ in favor of Lyonsevoked sympathetic echoes over the State, which promptly convinced thepolitical chieftains that he was the strongest candidate to pit againstPatterson. The enthusiasm caused by the suggestion of his name spreadrapidly, and at the end of a week his nomination at the convention wasregarded as certain.The championship of the _Sentinel_ was a complete surprise to Selma. Shehad assumed that her husband would return to Washington, and thatpolitical promotion for the present was out of the question. When shesaw her husband's features looking out at her from a large cut on thefront page of the morning newspaper, and read the conspicuous headingwhich accompanied it--"The _Sentinel_ nominates as Governor the Hon.James O. Lyons of Benham, the most eloquent orator and mostpublic-spirited citizen of the State"--her heart gave a bound, and sheeagerly asked herself, "Why not?" That was just what they needed, whatshe needed to secure her hold on the social evolution of Benham. As thewife of the Governor of the State she would be able to ignore the peoplewho held aloof from her, and introduce the reforms in social behavior onwhich her heart was set."James, have you seen this?" she asked, eagerly.Lyons was watching her from across the breakfast table. He had seen it,and had laid the newspaper within her reach."Yes, dear. It is very complimentary, isn't it?""But what does it mean? Are you to be Governor? Did you know of it,James?""I knew that my name, with others, had been mentioned by those who werelooking for a candidate whom we can elect. But this nomination of the_Sentinel_ comes from a clear sky. Would you like to have me Governor,Selma?""Yes, indeed. If the chance is offered you, James, you will surelyaccept it. It would please me immensely to see you Governor. We shouldnot be separated then part of the year, and--and I should be able herein Benham to help you as your wife ought to help you. I know," sheadded, "that you have been looking forward to the next session ofCongress, in the hope of distinguishing yourself, but isn't this a fineropportunity? Doesn't it open the door to splendid possibilities?"Lyons nodded. His wife's eager presentation of the case confirmed hisown conclusions. "It is an important decision to make," he said, withgravity. "If I am not elected, I shall have lost my place in theCongressional line, and may find difficulty in recovering it later. Butif the party needs me, if the State needs me, I must not think of that.I cannot help being gratified, encouraged by the suggestion that myfellow-citizens of my political faith are turning to me as theirstandard-bearer at this time when great public issues are involved. If Ican serve God and my country in this way, and at the same time pleaseyou, my wife, what can I ask better?"He spoke with genuine feeling and reverence, for it was in keeping withhis religious tendencies to recognize in advance the solemnresponsibilities of high office, and to picture himself as the agent ofthe heavenly powers. This attitude of mind always found Selmasympathetic and harmonious. Her eyes kindled with enthusiasm, and shereplied:"You view the matter as I would have you view it, James. If this trustis committed to us by Providence, it is our duty to accept it as loversof our country and promoters of true progress.""It would seem so. And in some ways," he said, as though he felt theimpulse to be reasonably frank toward Providence in his acceptance ofthe trust, "my election as Governor would be advantageous to mypolitical and business interests. I have not sought the office," headded with dignified unction, "but my knowledge of local conditionsleads me to believe that this action of the _Sentinel_ signifies thatcertain powerful influences are working in my favor. I shall be able totell you more accurately in regard to this before long."Lyons happened to know that the Benham _Sentinel_ had enlarged its planttwo years previous, and that Horace Elton was still the holder of itsnotes for borrowed money. The transaction had passed through his bank,and in the course of his mental search for reasons to account for thesudden flat-footed stand of the newspaper, the thought came into hismind and dwelt there that Elton was at the bottom of it. If so, what wasElton's reason? Why should Elton, a Republican, desire his nomination?Surely not to compass his defeat.In this connection Elton's friendship and the prophecy made to Selma asto his political future occurred to him and forbade an invidioussupposition. "Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and thou shalt be what thouart promised!" Lyons left Selma with the conviction that he would findElton to be mainly responsible for what had taken place. Shortly afterreaching his office he received a note from him asking for anappointment. Punctually at twelve o'clock Elton arrived and was showninto Lyons's private room. Lyons gave orders that he was not to bedisturbed, for he believed that the results of the interview were likelyto have a serious bearing on his career as a statesman.Both men were of heavy physique, but as they sat facing each other anobserver would have remarked that Elton's visage possessed a clean-cutcompactness of expression despite its rotund contour. His closelytrimmed whiskers, his small, clear, penetrating eyes, and the effect ofneatness conveyed by his personal appearance were so many externalindications of his mental lucidity and precision.In contrast Lyons's moon-shaped face, emphasized by its smooth-shavenmobile mouth, below which his almost white chin beard hung pendent,expressed a curious interplay of emotional sanctity, urbane shrewdness,and solemn self-importance."Governor Lyons, at your service," said Elton, regarding him steadily."Do you think so?""I know so, if you desire it.""The nomination, you mean?""The election by a comfortable majority."Lyons breathed hard with satisfaction. "If the people of the Statechoose to confide their interests to my custody, I shall not refuse toserve them.""So I supposed. You may be wondering, Lyons, why I, a Republican, shouldbe talking like this. I will tell you. Observation has led me to believethat the people of this State will elect a Democratic Governor thisyear. The hard times will hurt the administration. Consequently, as yourfriend and my own friend, I have taken the liberty to indicate to themanagers of your party their strongest man. I am responsible for whatyou saw on the front page of the _Sentinel_ this morning. There need notbe much difficulty," he added, significantly, "in securing emphaticendorsement throughout the State of the _Sentinel's_ preference."Lyons looked grave. "You must be aware that our views on publicquestions--especially those which concern the relations of capital andlabor--are not the same.""Certainly. I tell you frankly that while, from a humanitarian point ofview, I respect your desire to relieve the inequalities of moderncivilization, as a business man and a man of some property I do notregard the remedies presented by your party platform as just oradequate. I recognize that your opinions are hostile to corporateinterests, but I have gathered also that you are disposed to bereasonable and conciliatory; that you are not inclined to regard all menand all measures as dangerous, merely because they have means or areintroduced in the name of capital.""It has always seemed to me that a conciliatory spirit secures the mostdefinite results for the public," assented Lyons."Precisely. See here, Lyons," Elton said, leaning forward across thetable at which they were sitting, "I wish to be entirely frank with you.You know me well enough to understand that I have not offered you mysupport in any philanthropic spirit. I could not have deceived you as tothis had I tried. I am a practical man, and have an axe to grind. I amurging your election as Governor because I believe you to possessintelligent capacity to discriminate between what is harmful to thecommunity and what is due to healthy, individual enterprise--the energywhich is the sap of American citizenship. We capitalists have no fear ofan honest man, provided he has the desire and the ability to protectlegitimate business acumen against the slander of mere demagogues. Ihave a bill here," he added, drawing a printed document from his pocket,"which I am desirous to see passed by the next legislature. It embodiesa charter authorizing the acquisition and merger in one corporation ofall the gas companies of this State, and an extension of corporatepowers so as to cover all forms of municipal lighting. Were your handsnot tied by your prospective election, I should be glad to offer you anopportunity to become one of the incorporators, for I believe that theundertaking will be lucrative. That, of course, is out of the question.Now then, this is a perfectly honest bill. On its face, to be sure, itsecures a valuable franchise for the petitioners, and consequently mayencounter some opposition. But, on the other hand, no one who considersthe matter candidly and closely can fail to recognize that the greatpublic will secure cheaper gas and more efficient service as the resultof the consolidation. And there is where I felt that I could count onyour intelligence. You would not allow the plea that capitalists wereinterested in obtaining a profitable franchise to obscure the more vitalconsideration that the community will be the true gainers."Lyons bowed graciously, and stroked his beard. "What is it you wish meto do?" he asked."To read the bill in the first place; to convince yourself that what Ihave told you is true; to satisfy yourself that the measure isessentially harmless. The bill is not long. Read it now and let me hearyour objections. I have some papers here to look over which will occupyme a quarter of an hour, if you can spare me the time."Lyons acquiesced, and proceeded to peruse slowly the document. When hehad finished it he folded it solemnly and returned it to Elton. "It is abill framed in the interest of capital, but I cannot say that the publicwill be prejudiced by it. On the contrary, I should judge that the priceof gas in our cities and towns would be lowered as a consequence of thereduction in running expenses caused by the projected consolidation.What is it that you wish me to do?""Agree to sign the bill as it now stands if it passes the legislature."Lyons rested his head on his hand and his mouth moved tremulously. "If Iam elected governor," he said, "I wish to serve the people honestly andfearlessly.""I am sure of it. I ask you to point out to me in what manner this billtrenches upon the rights of the people. You yourself have noted thecrucial consequence: It will lower the price of gas. If at the same timeI am benefited financially, why should I not reap the reasonable rewardof my foresight?""I will sign the bill, Elton, if it comes to me for signature. I may becriticised at first, but the improved public service and reduction ofthe gas bills will be my justification, and show that I have not beenunmindful of the interests of the great public whose burdens my party isseeking to lighten.""I shall count on you, then," said Elton, after a pause. "The failure ofthe bill at the last stage when I was expecting its passage might affectmy affairs seriously.""If the legislature does its part, I will do mine," responded Lyons,augustly. "I will sign the bill if it comes to me in the present form.""I thank you, Governor."Lyons looked confused but happy at the appellation."By the way," said Elton, after he had returned the papers to hispocket, "these are trying times for men with financial obligations. Itis my custom to be frank and not to mince matters where importantinterests are concerned. A candidate for office in this campaign willneed the use of all his faculties if he is to be successful. I should bevery sorry for the sake of my bill to allow your mind to be distractedby solicitude in regard to your private affairs. Some of the best andmost prudent of our business men are pressed to-day for ready money. Iam in a position to give you temporary assistance if you require it. Injustice to my interests you must not let delicacy stand in the way ofyour accepting my offer."Lyons's bosom swelled with the tide of returning happiness. He hadscarcely been able to believe his ears. Yet here was a definite,spontaneous proposition to remove the incubus which weighed upon hissoul. Here was an opportunity to redeem the bonds of the Parsons estateand to repair his damaged self-respect. It seemed to him as though theclouds of adversity which had encompassed him had suddenly been sweptaway, and that Providence was smiling down at him as her approved andfavorite son. His emotion choked his speech. His lip trembled and hiseyes looked as though they would fill with tears. After a brief pause hearticulated that he was somewhat pressed for ready money. Someexplanation of his affairs followed, the upshot of which was that Eltonagreed to indorse Lyons's promissory notes held by the banks to theamount of 60,000, and to accept as collateral for a personal loan of40,000 certain securities of new local enterprises which had no presentmarketable value. By this arrangement his property was amply protectedfrom sacrifice; he would be able to adjust his speculative account inNew York; and he could await with a tranquil soul the return ofcommercial confidence. Lyons's heart was overflowing with satisfaction.He pressed Elton's hand and endeavored to express his gratitude withappropriate grandiloquence. But Elton disclaimed the obligation,asserting that he had acted merely from self-interest to make theelection of his candidate more certain.The loan of 40,000 was completed within forty-eight hours, and beforethe end of another week Lyons had rescued the bonds of the Parsonsestate from pawn, and disposed of his line of stocks carried by Williams& Van Horne. They were sold at a considerable loss, but he made up hismind to free his soul for the time being from the toils and torment ofspeculation and to nurse his dwarfed resources behind the bulwark ofElton's relief fund until the financial situation cleared. He felt asthough he had grown ten years younger, and without confiding to Selmathe details of these transactions he informed her ecstatically that,owing to certain important developments, due partly to the friendlinessof Horace Elton, the outlook for their future advancement had never beenso bright. When a month later he was nominated as Governor he threwhimself into the contest with the convincing ardor of sincere,untrammelled faith in the reforms he was advocating. His speechesreflected complete concentration of his powers on the issues of thecampaign and evoked enthusiasm throughout the State by their eloquentarraignment of corporate rapacity at the expense of the sovereignpeople. In several of his most telling addresses he accused the nationaladministration of pandering to the un-American gamblers who bought andsold stocks in Wall street.CHAPTER IX.Lyons was chosen Governor by a large majority, as Elton had predicted.The Republican Party was worsted at the polls and driven out of powerboth at Washington and in the State. Lyons ran ahead of his ticket,receiving more votes than the presidential electors. The campaign wasfull of incidents grateful to Selma's self esteem. Chief among these wasthe conspicuous allusions accorded her by the newspapers. The campaignitself was a fervid repetition of the stirring scenes of two yearsprevious. Once more torch-light processions in vociferous serriedcolumns attested the intensity of party spirit. Selma felt herself anadept through her former experience, and she lost no opportunity to showherself in public and bear witness to her devotion to her husband'scause. It pleased her to think that the people recognized her when sheappeared on the balcony or reviewing stand, and that her presence evokedan increase of enthusiasm.But the newspaper publicity was even more satisfying, for it centredattention unequivocally on her. Columns of descriptive matter relativeto her husband's personality began to appear as soon as it becameobvious that he was to be Governor. These articles aimed to beexhaustive in their character, covering the entire scope of his pastlife, disclosing pitiless details in regard to his habits, tastes, andprivate concerns. Nothing which could be discovered or ferreted out wasomitted; and most of these biographies were illuminated by a variety ofmore or less hideous cuts showing, for example, his excellency as helooked as a school boy, his excellency as a fledgling attorney, thehumble home where his excellency was born, and his excellency's presentstately but hospitable residence on Benham's River Drive. Almost everynewspaper in the State took its turn at contributing something which itconceived to be edifying to this reportorial budget. And after theGovernor, came the turn of the Governor's lady, as she was called.Selma liked best the articles devoted exclusively to herself; where sheappeared as the special feature of the newspaper issue, not merely as anadjunct to her husband. But she liked them all, and she was mostbenignant in her reception of the several newspaper scribes, principallyof her own sex, who sought an interview for the sake of copy. Shewithheld nothing in regard to her person, talents, household, or tasteswhich would in her opinion be effective in print. She had a photographof herself taken in simple, domestic matronly garb to supplement thosewhich she already possessed, one of which revealed the magnificence ofthe attire she wore at the President's Reception; another portrayedLittleton's earnest bride, and still a fourth disclosed her as thewistful, aspiring school-mistress on the threshold of womanhood. These,and the facts appropriate to them, she meted out to her biographers fromtime to time, lubricating her amiable confidences with the assertionthat both she and her husband felt that the people were entitled to bemade familiar with the lives of their public representatives. As theresult of her gracious behavior, her willingness to supply interestingdetails concerning herself, and her flattering tendency to becomeintimate on the spot with the reporters who visited her, the newspaperarticles in most cases were in keeping with Selma's prepossessions.Those which pleased her most emphasized in the first place herintellectual gifts and literary talents, intimating delicately that shehad refused brilliant offers for usefulness with her pen and on thelecture platform in order to become the wife of Congressman Lyons, towhom her counsel and high ideals of public service were a constantstimulus. Emphasized in the second place her husband's and her own pioustastes, and strong religious convictions, to which their constant churchattendance and the simple sanctity of their American home boretestimony. Emphasized in the third place--reproducing ordinarily asketch and cut of her drawing-room--her great social gifts and graces,which had made her a leader of society in the best sense of the wordboth in Benham and in New York. A few of the articles stated injudicious terms that she had been twice a widow. Only one of them setthis forth in conspicuous and opprobrious terms: "Her Third Husband! OurChief Magistrate's Wife's Many Marriages!" Such was the unsympathetic,alliterative heading of the malicious statement which appeared in anopposition organ. It did no more than recall the fact that she hadobtained a divorce from her first husband, who had in his despair takento drink, and intimate that her second husband had not been altogetherhappy. Selma wept when she read the article. She felt that it was crueland uncalled for; that it told only half the truth and traduced herbefore the American people. She chose to conceive that it had beeninspired by Pauline and Mrs. Hallett Taylor, neither of whom had senther a word of congratulation on her promotion to be the Governor's wife.Who but Pauline knew that her marriage with Littleton had not beencompletely harmonious? Who but Mrs. Taylor or one of her set would havethe malice to insinuate that she had been merciless to Babcock? This wasone libel in a long series of complimentary productions. Therepresentation of the family group was made complete by occasionalreferences to the Governor elect's mother--"Mother Lyons, the venerableparent of our chief magistrate." Altogether Selma felt that the picturepresented to the public was a truthful and inspiring record of pious andenterprising American life, which showed to the community that itschoice of a Governor had been wise and was merited.Close upon the election and these eulogistic biographies came theinauguration, with Lyons's eloquent address. Selma, of course, hadspecial privileges--a reserved gallery in the State House, to which sheissued cards of admission to friends of her own selection. Occupying infestal attire the centre of this conspicuous group, she felt that shewas the cynosure of every eye. She perceived that she was constantlypointed out as the second personage of the occasion. To the fewlegislators on the floor whom she already knew she took pains to bowfrom her seat with gracious cordiality, intending from the outset to aidher husband by captivating his friends and conciliating the leaders ofthe opposition party. On her way to and from the gallery she was joinedby several members, to each of whom she tried to convey subtly theimpression that she purposed to take an earnest interest in legislativeaffairs, and that her husband would be apt to consult her in regard toclose questions. On the morning after the inauguration she had thesatisfaction of seeing her own portrait side by side with that of herhusband on the front page of two newspapers, a flattering indication, asshe believed, that the press already recognized her value both as ahelpmate to him and an ornament to the State. She took up her life asthe Governor's lady feeling that her talents and eagerness to do goodhad finally prevailed and that true happiness at last was in store forher. She was satisfied with her husband and recognized his righteouspurpose and capacity as a statesman, but she believed secretly that hisrapid success was due in a large measure to her genius. Her promptinghad inspired him to make a notable speech in his first Congress. Hercharms and clever conversation had magnetized Mr. Elton so that he hadseen fit to nominate him for Governor. A fresh impulse to herself-congratulation that virtue and ability were reaping their rewardwas given a few weeks later by the announcement which Lyons read fromthe morning newspaper that the firm of Williams & Van Horne had faileddisastrously. The circumstances attending their down-fall weresensational. It appeared that Van Horne, the office partner, who managedthe finances, had shot himself as the culmination of a series offraudulent hypothecations of securities and misrepresentations to whichit was claimed that Williams was not a party. The firm had beenhopelessly insolvent for months, and had been forced to the wall at lastby a futile effort on the part of Van Horne to redeem the situation by afinal speculation on a large scale. It had failed owing to thecontinuation of the state of dry rot in the stock market, and utter ruinfollowed.The regret which Lyons entertained as he read aloud the tragic story wasovershadowed in his mind by his own thankfulness that he had redeemedthe bonds and settled his account with them before the crash came. Hewas so absorbed by his own emotions that he failed to note thetriumphant tone of his wife's ejaculation of amazement. "Failed!Williams & Van Horne failed! Oh, how did it happen? I always felt surethat they would fail sooner or later."Selma sat with tightly folded hands listening to the exciting narrative,which Lyons read for her edification with the urbanely mournful emphasisof one who has had a narrow escape. He stopped in the course of it torelieve any solicitude which she might be feeling in regard to hisdealings with the firm, by the assertion that he had only two monthsprevious closed out his account owing to the conviction that prudentinvestors were getting under cover. This assurance gave the episode astill more providential aspect in Selma's eyes. In the first flush ofher gratitude that Flossy had been superbly rebuked for her frivolousexistence, she had forgotten that they were her husband's brokers.Moreover the lack of perturbation in his manner was not calculated toinspire alarm. But the news that Lyons had been shrewd enough to escapeat the twelfth hour without a dollar's loss heightened the justice ofthe situation. She listened with throbbing pulses to the particulars.She could scarcely credit her senses that her irrepressible andlight-hearted enemy had been confounded at last--confronted withbankruptcy and probable disgrace. She interrupted the reading to expressher scepticism regarding the claim that Williams had no knowledge of thefrauds."How could he be ignorant? He must have known. He must have bribed thereporters to put that in so as to arouse the sympathy of some of theirfashionable friends. Van Horne is dead, and the lips of the dead aresealed."Selma spoke with the confidence born of bitterness. She was pleased withher acumen in discerning the true inwardness of the case. Her husbandnodded with mournful acquiescence. "It would seem," he said, "as if hemust have had an inkling, at least, of what was going on.""Of course he had. Gregory Williams, with all his faults, was awide-awake man. I always said that."Lyons completed the reading and murmured with a sigh, which was halfpity, half grateful acknowledgment of his own good fortune--"It's a badpiece of business. I'm glad I had the sense to act promptly."Selma was ruminating. Her steel bright eyes shone with exultation. Hersense of righteousness was gratified and temporarily appeased. "They'llhave to sell their house, of course, and give up their horses andsteam-yacht? I don't see why it doesn't mean that Flossy and her husbandmust come down off their pedestal and begin over again? It follows,doesn't it, that the heartless set into which they have wormed their waywill drop them like hot coals?"All these remarks were put by Selma in the slightly interrogative form,as though she were courting any argument to the contrary which could beadduced in order to knock it in the head. But Lyons saw no reason todiffer from her verdict. "It means necessarily great mortification forthem and a curtailment of their present mode of life," he said. "I amsorry for them.""Sorry? Of course, James, it is distressing to hear that misfortune hasbefallen any person of one's acquaintance, and so far as GregoryWilliams himself is concerned I have no wish to see him punished simplybecause he has been worldly and vainglorious. You thought him able in abusiness way, and liked to meet him. But as for her, Flossy, his wife,"Selma continued, with a gasp, "it would be sheer hypocrisy for me toassert that I am sorry for her. I should deem myself unworthy of beingconsidered an earnest-minded American woman if I did not maintain thatthis disgrace which has befallen them is the logical and legitimateconsequence of their godless lives--especially of her frivolity andpresumptuous indifference to spiritual influences. That woman, James, isutterly hostile to the things of the spirit. You have no conception--Ihave never told you, because he was your friend, and I was willing tolet bygones be bygones on the surface on your account--you have noconception of the cross her behavior became to me in New York. Fromalmost the first moment we met I saw that we were far apart as the polesin our views of the responsibilities of life. She sneered at everythingwhich you and I reverence, and she set her face against true progressand the spread of American principles. She claimed to be my friend, andto sympathize with my zeal for social truth, yet all the time she wastoadying secretly the people whose luxurious exclusiveness made metremble sometimes for the future of our country. She and her husbandwere prosperous, and everything he touched seemed to turn to gold. Itmay sound irreverent, James, but there was a time during my life in NewYork when I was discouraged; when it seemed as though heaven weremocking me and my husband in our homely struggle against the forces ofevil, and bestowing all its favors on a woman whose example was a menaceto American womanhood! Sorry? Why should I be sorry to see justicetriumph and shallow iniquity rebuked? I would give Florence Williamsmoney if she is in want, but I am thankful, very thankful, that herheartless vanity has found its proper reward."Lyons fingered his beard. "I didn't know she was as bad as that, Selma.Now that they have come to grief, we are not likely to be brought incontact with them, and in all probability they will pass out of ourlives. Williams was smart and entertaining, but I never liked his takingadvantage of the circumstances of my having an account in his office tourge me to support a measure at variance with my political convictions.""Precisely. The trouble with them both, James, is that they have noconscience; and it is eminently just they should be made to realize thatpeople who lack conscience cannot prosper in this country in the longrun. 'They have loosed the awful lightnings of his terrible swiftsword.'""I say 'amen' to that assuredly, Selma," Lyons answered. Hispredilection to palliate equivocal circumstances was never proof againstclear, evidence of moral delinquency. When his religious scruples werefinally offended, he was grave and unrelenting.The downfall of the Williamses continued to be a sweet solace and sourceof encouragement to Selma. It made her, when taken in conjunction withher own recent progress, feel that the whirligig of time was working inher behalf after all; and that if she persevered, not merely Flossy, butall those who worshipped mammon, and consequently failed to recognizeher talents, would be made to bite the dust. At the moment these enemiesseemed to have infested Benham. Numerically speaking, they wereunimportant, but they had established an irritating, irregular skirmishline, one end of which occupied Wetmore College, another held secretmidnight meetings at Mrs. Hallett Taylor's. Rumors of variousundertakings, educational, semi-political, artistic, or philanthropic,agitated or directed by this fringe of society, came to her ears fromtime to time, but she heard them as an outsider. When she became theGovernor's wife she had said to herself that now these aristocrats wouldbe compelled to admit her to their counsels. But she found, to herannoyance, that the election made no difference. Neither Pauline norMrs. Taylor nor any of the coterie had asked her to join them, and shewas unpleasantly conscious that there were people on the River Drive whoshowed no more desire to make her acquaintance than when she had beenMrs. Lewis Babcock. What did this mean? It meant simply--she began toargue--that she must hold fast to her faith and bide her time. That ifshe and her friends kept a bold front and resisted the encroachments ofthis pernicious spirit, Providence would interfere presently andconfound these enemies of social truth no less obviously than it hadalready overwhelmed Mrs. Gregory Williams. As the wife of the Governor,she was clearly in a position to maintain this bold front effectively.Every mail brought to her requests for her support, and the sanction ofher signature to social or charitable enterprises. Her hospital wasflourishing along the lines of the policy which she had indicated, andwas feeling the advantage of her political prosperity. She was able togive the petition in behalf of Mrs. Hamilton, which contained nowtwenty-five thousand signatures, fresh value and solemnity by means ofan autograph letter from the Governor's wife, countersigned by theGovernor. This, with the bulky list of petitioners, she addressed anddespatched directly to Queen Victoria. Her presence was in constantdemand at all sorts of functions, at many of which she had theopportunity to make a few remarks; to express the welcome of the State,or to utter words of sympathy and encouragement to those assembled. Inthe second month of her husband's administration, she had thesatisfaction of greeting, in her double capacity as newly-electedPresident of the Benham Institute and wife of the Governor, theFederation of Women's Clubs of the United States, on the occasion of itsannual meeting at Benham. This federation was the incorporated fruit ofthe Congress of Women's Clubs, which Selma had attended as a delegatejust previous to her divorce from Babcock, and she could not refrainfrom some exultation at the progress she had made since then as she satwielding the gavel over the body of women delegates from every State inthe Union. The meeting lasted three days. Literary exercises alternatedwith excursions to points of interest in the neighborhood, at all ofwhich she was in authority, and the celebration was brought to abrilliant close by a banquet, to which men were invited. At this Selmaacted as toastmaster, introducing the speakers of the occasion, whichincluded her own husband. Lyons made a graceful allusion to herstimulating influence as a helpmate and her executive capacity, whichelicited loud applause. Succeeding this meeting of the Federation ofWomen's Clubs came a series of semi-public festivities under thepatronage of women--philanthropic, literary or social in character--forthe fever to perpetuate in club form every congregation, of free-borncitizens, except on election day, had seized Benham in common with theother cities of the country in its grasp, to each of which theGovernor's wife was invited as the principal guest of honor. Selma thusfound a dozen opportunities to exhibit herself to a large audience andtestify to her faith in democratic institutions.On the 22d of February, Washington's birthday, she held a reception attheir house on River Drive, for which cards had been issued a fortnightprevious. She pathetically explained to the reporters that, had thedimensions and resources of her establishment permitted, she and theGovernor would simply have announced themselves at home to the communityat large; that they would have preferred this, but of course it wouldnever do. The people would not be pleased to see a rabble confound thehospitality of the chief magistrate and his wife. The people demandedproper dignity from their representatives in office. The list ofinvitations which Selma sent out was, however, comprehensive. She aimedto invite everyone of social, public, commercial or politicalimportance. A full band was in attendance, and a liberal collatio
