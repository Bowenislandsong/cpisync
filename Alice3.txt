efinitionsare prose-forms of mind action, while poetry in its highermanifestations is pure emotion, outpassing prose limits. Yet one canknow poetry if he cannot completely define it. The one essentialelement which distinguishes it from prose is rhythm. In its primalexpressions this is mainly a rhythm of stresses and sounds--of accentsand measures, of alliterations and rhymes. Poetry began when man,swaying his body, first sang or moaned to give expression to his joyor sorrow. Its earliest forms are the songs which accompany thesimplest emotions. When rowers were in a boat the swinging oars becamerhythmic, and the oarsman's chant naturally followed. When the savageovercame his enemy, he danced his war dance, and sang his war songaround his campfire at night, tone and words and gestures all fittinginto harmony with the movement of his body. So came the chants andsongs of work and of triumph. For the dead warrior the moan oflamentation fitted itself to the slower moving to and fro of themourner, and hence came the elegy. In its first expression this wasbut inarticulate, half action, half music, dumbly voicing the emotionthrough the senses; its rhythms were all for the ear and it had littlemeaning beyond the crude representation of some simple human desireand grief.It became poetry when it put a thrill of exultation in work, ofdelight in victory, or of grief at loss by death, into some rhythmicform tangible to the senses. There grew up thereafter a body ofrhythmic forms--lines, stanzas, accents, rhythms, verbal harmonies.These forms are the outward dress of poetry, and may rightly be thefirst subject of the student's study. We properly give the name ofpoetry to verses such as Southey's "Lodore," Poe's "Bells," orLanier's "Song of the Chattahoochee," which do little more than singto our ears the harmonies of sound, the ultimate rhythms of nature.Yet it is not merely the brook or the bell or the river, that we hearin the poem, but the echoing of that large harmony of nature of whichthe sound of the brook or the bell is only the single strain. Throughthe particular it suggests the universal, as does all poetry, leadingthrough nature up to something greater, far beyond. This rhythm isbest studied in poems that were written to be sung or chanted. If onecould read Greek, or Anglo-Saxon, or Old High German, or the Englishof Chaucer's day, he could quickly train his ear to be independent ofthe hand-books on versification, by reading aloud, or listening as oneread aloud, the "Odyssey" or the "Beowulf," or the "Nibelungen Lied"or the "Canterbury Tales." These would be better for this purpose thanany modern verses, for the reason that they were intended to be sungor chanted, and so all the rhythms are real to the senses. Since thebarrier of language bars out for most of us this older verse, we canread the early ballads, the lyrics of the Elizabethan time, when asyet verses spoke mainly to the ear, or some modern poems of thesimpler type, such as "Evangeline" or "Hiawatha."Such poetry, which is mainly to delight and charm the ear, is really aprimal form of verse and we may properly call it the poetry of theSenses. In studying it Lanier's "Science of English Verse" is adelightful companion, and many minor hand-books besides those namedabove, such as are found in most schools, and some of the shorteraccounts of versification such as are found in works on rhetoric, willgive assistance.Yet the pathway to the mastery of the problems of metre is for eachstudent to tread alone. The best plan is to read aloud a considerablequantity. Then the technical language of the books will lose itsterrors and the simplicity of construction of good poetry will becomeapparent. If the student will read so much of this poetry that hissenses become responsive to its music, he will no longer need ahand-book. For this purpose let him read such poems as can be sung,chanted, or spoken to the ear; such as Macaulay's "Lays of AncientRome," Scott's "Marmion," Browning's "Pied Piper" and "How TheyBrought the Good News," Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade." Lethim read mainly for the senses rather than for the mind, getting thereward in the quickening of life through the throbbing rhythms; thenthe metrical system of poetry will become as real to him as therhythmic movements of the planets are to an astronomer. There is noother way to get a feeling for the pulsations of poetry than throughthis intimate acquaintance. Without this, months of reading ofamphibrachs and trochees and dactyls will not avail. It should be readaloud as much as possible to make the swing of its verses perfectlyclear. When it sings to us as we read, it has begun to teach themessage of its rhythms.Thus far the text-books have been pleasant companions, even whenunable to give as much aid to the student as he could wish; but thefact will come to him at length that there is something more in poetrythan the hand-books permit him to consider. These books deal with theforms, and most of them with the forms only. They analyze the methods,work out the metre, show how the parts are woven together, explain howthe chords produce the harmonies. But just in proportion as thestudent becomes learned in these rhythms, and can distinguish minuteor subtle variations of metrical structure, does he realize that thisstudy teaches not its own use and that there is something beyond whichmust be won by his own observation. He finds in his search forrhythmical perfection that there are poems which make little appeal tohis senses, whose lines do not sing themselves through his day-dreams,which yet affect his imagination even more powerfully than the musicalstrains thrilled his senses. He finds that there is much more inpoetry than its rhymes and jingles, that there is a rhythm greaterthan that of the senses. In its more complex forms poetry is rhythm ofthought, leading the mind to find relations which prose may describe,but which poetry alone can recreate. There is such a thing as a prosethought and such a thing as a poetic thought. The one gives withexactness the fact as it exists, clearly, honestly, directly, and forall completed and tangible things is the natural medium of expression.The other parallels the actual with a suggestion of an idealrhythmically consonant with the motive underlying the fact. Justice,for example, deals in prose fashion with a crime and awards thepunishment which the law allows; poetic justice suggests suchrecompense as would come of itself in a community perfectly organized.The prose of life is honest living, a worthy endeavor to do the bestone can in the world as it is; the poetry of life is the feeling for,and the striving after, the bringing of this life into harmony with anobler living. So we rightly give the name of poetry to such verse asGoldsmith's "Deserted Village," Johnson's "London," Gray's "Elegy,"Wordsworth's "Excursion," Milton's "Paradise Lost," Chaucer's"Knight's Tale," Browning's "King and the Book," Tennyson's "InMemoriam," which do not much stir our senses. They parallel the realwith the ideal, suggesting the eternal rhythms of infinite mind as thepoetry of the senses suggests the eternal rhythms of omnipotentnature.This poetry of the Intellect is the second great division of thepoetic realm. Beyond it lies still another; for there are spiritualharmonies which the mind alone cannot compass, and which the sensesalone cannot interpret. The hand-books know little of spiritualharmonies, and do not go beyond their academic classifications oflyric and epic, and their catalogues of pentameters, hexameters, oralexandrines. But the student can for himself push his observationbeyond, and come to the poetry of the higher imagination, where he canbe forgetful of the mere form and disdainful of the merely logicalrelations, where his spirit can as it were see face to face the truthbeyond the seeming. This is the poetry of the spirit, and ought tocome as a revelation to the searcher. He may first find it in somepure lyric such as Shelley's "Skylark," or in some mystical fantasysuch as Moore's "Lallah Rookh" or Coleridge's "Christabel," or in somestory of human abnegation such as Tennyson's "Enoch Arden," or somewail of a soul in pain, as in Shelley's "Adonais," or in some outburstof exultant grief such as Whitman's "Captain, My Captain," or in somerevelation of the unseen potencies close about us, as in Browning's"Saul," or in some vision of the mystery of this our earthly strugglesuch as "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came," or in some answer ofthe spirit to a never stilled question such as Wordsworth's "Ode:Intimations of Immortality." When he thus finds it he has come topoetry in its highest use. In his "Alexander's Feast" Dryden hints attwo great functions of poetry in the lines:  "He raised a mortal to the skies,  She drew an angel down."The office of poetry is to parallel the actual with the ideal, to castupon an earthly landscape something of a heavenly glow, to interpretearthly things in terms of the spirit. The poetry of the Senses liftsa mortal to the skies, thinking the thought of one higher than itselfas the poet muses, singing the songs of an angelic choir in harmonywith the rhythm of the verse. The poetry of the Spirit brings themessage of the angels down to men and makes the harmonies they speakthe music of this earthly life.The highest type of poetry lends itself perfectly to earnest andprofound study. In class work it is usually better to study poets aswell as poems, and to study thoroughly a few works of a great master.Poetry is essentially a synthetic art; it unites the wandering desiresof our hearts and spirits to make one single and enduring impression.Poetry speaks also the mood, the aspiration, and the deepest intent ofits author; so that the great poet is the one who brings us mostdirectly to understand its art. For most student classes it is best totake a single poet for interpretation, and to study in succession asmall number--say six to ten--of his works, making one, or at leasttwo or three, the subject of the conferences for each week. The choiceof author will be dependent on many considerations and cannot here bepositively advised, but one will not go astray in choosing Wordsworth,Tennyson, Browning, Longfellow, or Whittier, or three of them, for aseason's work. Intelligent direction is of great assistance in makingthe study definite and progressive. Choose first of all the poemswhich seem to have influenced men, for to move men is the final testof poetry. If there is no class, and no leader, let the student makehis choice by a preliminary examination. Let him read rapidly, and forthe single impression, the poems of Wordsworth whose titles seem mostfamiliar to him as he scans them over; such as "Tintern Abbey,""Yarrow Unvisited," "Solitary Reaper," "Lucy," "We are Seven," "TheIntimations of Immortality," "She was a Phantom of Delight," and a fewof the lyrical ballads; then let him read Tennyson's "Locksley Hall,""Maud," "The Idylls of the King," and a few of the shorter poems; lethim read Browning's "Saul," "Abt Vogler," "The Grammarian's Funeral,""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came," "Pippa Passes," one or twodramas, and a few of the brief poems in the volume "Men and Women."Then let him make his own list for study, taking those poems whichhave most stirred him, those which he remembers vividly after hisreading, those which have become a part of himself. If the studentmakes his choice frankly and sincerely, he has, in making it, begunhis study. Then let him frame for himself or get from his leader, ifhe has one, a list of the questions which each poem is to answer forhim. If the work be really poetry, its study ought to give a helptoward the solution of the first great problems: "What is poetry?" and"What is its revelation to the life of our senses, our hearts, and oursouls?" We have a right to ask of each poem three questions: "How doesit charm our senses?"; "How does it make the meaning of things clearerfor us?"; "How does it bring to us a renewal of life?" The firstquestion is better fitted for private study than for classinvestigation, the senses being delicate organs and shy in company.Let the minute matters of form and structure be gone over at home. Letthe student work out the metre, the typical line, and the variationsby which the poet gets his effects, the metaphors, the alliterations,the consonant and vowel harmonies. It will aid if this work be made asdefinite and as exact as an investigation in a scientific laboratory.But all this should be the student's home work. In the class the largedivisions of the poem should be sympathetically shown, so that eachstudent will comprehend the poem as a whole as the poet must haveconceived it. Then as some one reads aloud the lines the music of therhythms will come by assimilation rather than by analysis. Poetryparallels the real with the ideal to make a harmony before undreamedof. So in the lines sound re-echoes sound, and a subtle music but halfperceived sings itself out of the moving notes.What burden this music bears is the second question. Poetry differsfrom prose in that it lifts the thought so that its highest relationsand suggestions are made known. We have a right therefore to parallelthe prose sight with the poetic visions and to find in what the onetranscends the other. If we are studying the "Idylls of the King," forinstance, we may fitly ask what was the story as the poet took it, andinto what has he transformed it for us. This study of the thought ofthe poem is an excellent subject for class work. The questions shouldbe made definite and so grouped that sections of the class can chooseone or another phase of the problem; the conferences should be sodirected that a few clearly worked-out and thoroughly unified poeticthoughts will be left in the mind of each student.In all things practice may fitly supplement precept. In a readingcircle of which one of the editors of this series was a member thepoems of Tennyson were studied by a method closely resembling thatadvocated in this article. As a suggestion the topics and questionsfor one of the poems are here given. One of the members acted asleader. A brief essay reciting the history of the poem was read. Theentire poem was read aloud by one of the members of the class. Thenthe topics given below were discussed as presented in turn by groupsof students who had given especial attention to one of the topics. Inthe discussions the entire class joined, and at the close a very briefsumming up by the leader gathered up the threads of thought.Topic: "Locksley Hall" and "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After."Required Readings: "Locksley Hall"; "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After";"Lady Clara Vere de Vere"; "Sir Galahad."Suggested Readings: In connection with the earlier poem, "Ulysses" and"The Two Voices"; in connection with the later poem, "Maud," "Memoirof Tennyson," by Lord Hallam Tennyson.Suggestions for Study: (A) The physical basis of the poem.Study the metre. Why called Trochaic Octameter? In what way does thismetre resemble and in what way differ from Lowell's "Present Crisis,"Swinburne's "Triumph of Time," Browning's "There 's a woman like adewdrop" (from "The Blot i' the Scutcheon"), and Mrs. Browning's"Rhyme of the Duchess May"? Why is this metre peculiarly adapted tothe sentiment of "Locksley Hall"? How does the metre differ in effectfrom that of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe's "Battle Hymn of the Republic" andBryant's "The Death of the Flowers" and Tennyson's "May Queen"? Is theeffect of the rhythm optimistic as opposed to the pessimism of the"Triumph of Time," and why? Why are the lines of this poem so easilycarried in the memory? What is there in the use of the words whichgives such sweetness to the verses as one reads them aloud. Has thepoem for you a music of its own which haunts you like a rememberedvision? Find out, if you can, something of the secret of this music.(B) The intellectual interest of the poem.(1) Consider the meaning of difficult passages, such as "Fairy talesof science." Explain the meaning of stanzas containing the followingquotations: "Smote the chord of self"; "Cursed be social wants"; "Thata sorrow's crown of sorrow"; "But the jingling of the guinea"; "Slowlycomes a hungry people"; "Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers."(2) How long an interval elapsed between the writing of the above twopoems? Does any change in style or trend of thought indicate the lapseof time? The earlier poem was and is immensely popular. Why? Why isthe later one less popular?(3) What is the story in the poem, and in what manner is it told? Howis the story continued in "Sixty Years After"? Was Locksley Hall aninland or a seashore residence, and why? Describe the surroundingsfrom suggestions in the poems. Sum up what the hero tells of himselfand his love-story. What suggestions are there regarding thecharacters of Amy and Edith? Is the emotional side of the hero asfinely balanced as the intellectual side? What light is thrown on thecharacter of his love by his outbursts against Amy? Would it be fairto judge of Amy and her husband by what he says of them in his firstanguish? Does he ever admit that he judged them harshly? If so, do youagree with him altogether? Was it well for Amy to marry as she did?When obedience to parental wishes and love are in conflict, whichshould be followed? Did the hero's evil prophecies come true? Whoselove do you think was the greatest, Amy's, or his, or the Squire's?(4) How does Tennyson all through the poem make it a parable of humanlife?(C) The emotional influence of the poem. How has this poem influencedyou? For many persons, Tennyson, out of a simple love-story, has madea prophecy of ideal love. Has he for you? For many persons Tennysonmade poetry out of this simple story when he paralleled the tale ofearthly passion with a vision of completer life, so vivid that thepain and tragedy of this present life come to be for us but thepreparation for the better life to come, as the poet sings to us that"Through the ages one increasing purpose runs And the thoughts of menare widened with the process of the suns."Has he to you in like manner through his poem given a truer conceptionof the nature and use of poetry?Systematic study such as that suggested above will help in answeringthe questions, "What charm has this poem for us?" and "How does it puta deeper meaning into the events it records?" But it is difficult toframe formal questions the answers to which will show how a poemquickens life. The influence of a poem is so much a matter oftemperament and of emotion, both of the author and of the reader, thatone has to feel its power rather than to work it out logically. Poetrypasses beyond prose in that it quickens life by moving us to feel itsnobler emotions. It will teach its own lesson to the appreciativereader, and the student who gets fully into sympathy with a great poemwill have his whole life made brighter. Class work, donesympathetically and sincerely, will aid in finding the truestinterpretations. Yet studies teach not their own use. The higherblessings come to us unbidden if we as little children hope for them.We shall find the highest uses of poetry in remembering always that itmay at its best come to us as an                             "Angel of light  Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night."[Signature: Francis Hovey Stoddard]TABLE OF CONTENTS.

What constitutes a state?  Not high-raised battlement or labored mound,      Thick wall or moated gate;  Not cities proud with spires and turrets crowned;      Not bays and broad-armed ports,  Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride;      Not starred and spangled courts,  Where low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride.      No:--men, high-minded men,  With powers as far above dull brutes endued      In forest, brake, or den,  As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude,--      Men who their duties know,  But know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain,      Prevent the long-aimed blow,  And crush the tyrant while they rend the chain;      These constitute a State;  And sovereign law, that State's collected will,    O'er thrones and globes elate  Sits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.    Smit by her sacred frown,  The fiend, Dissension, like a vapor sinks;    And e'en the all-dazzling crown  Hides his faint rays, and at her bidding shrinks.    Such was this heaven-loved isle,  Than Lesbos fairer and the Cretan shore!    No more shall freedom smile?  Shall Britons languish, and be men no more?    Since all must life resign,  Those sweet rewards which decorate the brave    'Tis folly to decline,  And steal inglorious to the silent grave.SIR WILLIAM JONES.       *       *       *       *       *BREATHES THERE THE MAN?FROM "THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL," CANTO VI.  Breathes there the man with soul so dead  Who never to himself hath said,    This is my own, my native land!  Whose heart has ne'er within him burned,  As home his footsteps he hath turned    From wandering on a foreign strand?  If such there breathe, go, mark him well;  For him no minstrel raptures swell;  High though his titles, proud his name,  Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,  Despite those titles, power, and pelf,  The wretch, concentred all in self,  Living, shall forfeit fair renown,  And, doubly dying, shall go down  To the vile dust from whence he sprung,  Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *MY COUNTRY.  There is a land, of every land the pride,  Beloved by Heaven o'er all the world beside,  Where brighter suns dispense serener light,  And milder moons imparadise the night;  A land of beauty, virtue, valor, truth,  Time-tutored age, and love-exalted youth:  The wandering mariner, whose eye explores  The wealthiest isles, the most enchanting shores,  Views not a realm so bountiful and fair,  Nor breathes the spirit of a purer air.  In every clime, the magnet of his soul,  Touched by remembrance, trembles to that pole;  For in this land of Heaven's peculiar race,  The heritage of nature's noblest grace,  There is a spot of earth supremely blest,  A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest,  Where man, creation's tyrant, casts aside  His sword and sceptre, pageantry and pride,  While in his softened looks benignly blend  The sire, the son, the husband, brother, friend.  Here woman reigns; the mother, daughter, wife,  Strew with fresh flowers the narrow way of life:  In the clear heaven of her delightful eye  An angel-guard of love and graces lie;  Around her knees domestic duties meet,  And fireside pleasures gambol at her feet.  "Where shall that land, that spot of earth be found?"  Art thou a man?--a patriot?--look around;  O, thou shalt find, howe'er thy footsteps roam,  That land _thy_ country, and that spot _thy_ home!  Man, through all ages of revolving time,  Unchanging man, in every varying clime,  Deems his own land of every land the pride,  Beloved by Heaven o'er the world beside;  His home the spot of earth supremely blest,  A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest.JAMES MONTGOMERY.       *       *       *       *       *FATHER AND MOTHER TONGUE.  Our Father Land! and wouldst thou know    Why we should call it Father Land?  It is that Adam here below    Was made of earth by Nature's hand;  And he our father, made of earth,    Hath peopled earth on every hand;  And we, in memory of his birth,    Do call our country Father Land.  At first, in Eden's bowers, they say,    No sound of speech had Adam caught,  But whistled like a bird all day,--    And maybe 'twas for want of thought:  But Nature, with resistless laws,    Made Adam soon surpass the birds;  She gave him lovely Eve because    If he'd a wife they must _have words_.  And so the native land, I hold,    By male descent is proudly mine;  The language, as the tale hath told,    Was given in the female line.  And thus we see on either hand    We name our blessings whence they've sprung;  We call our country Father Land,    We call our language Mother Tongue.SAMUEL LOVER.       *       *       *       *       *EAST, WEST, HOME'S BEST.FROM "THE TRAVELLER."  As some lone miser visiting his store,  Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er;  Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill,  Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:  Thus to my breast alternate passions rise,  Pleased with each good that heaven to man supplies:  Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,  To see the sum of human bliss so small;  And oft I wish, amidst the scene to find  Some spot to real happiness consigned,  Where my worn soul, each wandering hope at rest,  May gather bliss to see my fellows blest.  But where to find that happiest spot below,  Who can direct, when all pretend to know?  The shuddering tenant of the frigid zone  Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own,  Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,  And his long nights of revelry and ease;  The naked negro, planting at the line,  Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,  Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,  And thanks his gods for all the good they gave.  Such is the patriot's boast where'er we roam,  His first, best country, ever is at home.  And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,  And estimate the blessings which they share,  Though patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find  An equal portion dealt to all mankind,  As different good, by art or nature given,  To different nations, makes their blessings even.OLIVER GOLDSMITH.       *       *       *       *       *GIFTS.  "O World-God, give me Wealth!" the Egyptian cried.  His prayer was granted. High as heaven behold  Palace and Pyramid; the brimming tide  Of lavish Nile washed all his land with gold.  Armies of slaves toiled ant-wise at his feet,  World-circling traffic roared through mart and street,  His priests were gods, his spice-balmed kings enshrined  Set death at naught in rock-ribbed charnels deep.  Seek Pharaoh's race to-day, and ye shall find  Rust and the moth, silence and dusty sleep.  "O World-God, give me Beauty!" cried the Greek.  His prayer was granted. All the earth became  Plastic and vocal to his sense; each peak,  Each grove, each stream, quick with Promethean flame,  Peopled the world with imaged grace and light.  The lyre was his, and his the breathing might  Of the immortal marble, his the play  Of diamond-pointed thought and golden tongue.  Go seek the sunshine race. Ye find to-day  A broken column and a lute unstrung.  "O World-God, give me Power!" the Roman cried.  His prayer was granted. The vast world was chained  A captive to the chariot of his pride,  The blood of myriad provinces was drained  To feed that fierce, insatiable red heart--  Invulnerably bulwarked every part  With serried legions and with close-meshed Code.  Within, the burrowing worm had gnawed its home:  A roofless ruin stands where once abode  The imperial race of everlasting Rome.  "O God-head, give me Truth!" the Hebrew cried.  His prayer was granted. He became the slave  Of the Idea, a pilgrim far and wide,  Cursed, hated, spurned, and scourged with none to save.  The Pharaohs knew him, and when Greece beheld,  His wisdom wore the hoary crown of Eld.  Beauty he hath forsworn, and wealth and power.  Seek him to-day, and find in every land.  No fire consumes him, neither floods devour;  Immortal through the lamp within his hand.EMMA LAZARUS.       *       *       *       *       *ENGLAND.FROM "THE TIMEPIECE": "THE TASK," BK. II.  England, with all thy faults, I love thee still,--  My country! and, while yet a nook is left  Where English minds and manners may be found,  Shall be constrained to love thee. Though thy clime  Be fickle, and thy year most part deformed  With dripping rains, or withered by a frost,  I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies,  And fields without a flower, for warmer France  With all her vines; nor for Ausonia's groves  Of golden fruitage and her myrtle bowers.  To shake thy senate, and from height sublime  Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire  Upon thy foes, was never meant my task:  But I can feel thy fortunes, and partake  Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart  As any thunderer there. And I can feel  Thy follies too; and with a just disdain  Frown at effeminates whose very looks  Reflect dishonor on the land I love.  How, in the name of soldiership and sense,  Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth  And tender as a girl, all essenced o'er  With odors, and as profligate as sweet,  Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,  And love when they should fight,--when such as these  Presume to lay their hand upon the ark  Of her magnificent and awful cause?  Time was when it was praise and boast enough  In every clime, and travel where we might,  That we were born her children. Praise enough  To fill the ambition of a private man,  That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,  And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own.WILLIAM COWPER.       *       *       *       *       *RULE, BRITANNIA.FROM "ALFRED," ACT II. SC. 5.  When Britain first, at Heaven's command,    Arose from out the azure main,  This was the charter of the land,    And guardian angels sung the strain:      _Rule, Britannia, rule the waves!      For Britons never will be slaves._  The nations not so blest as thee    Must in their turns to tyrants fall;  Whilst thou shalt flourish, great and free,    The dread and envy of them all.      _Rule, Britannia!_ etc.  Still more majestic shalt thou rise,    More dreadful from each foreign stroke;  As the loud blasts that tear the skies    Serve but to root thy native oak.      _Rule, Britannia!_ etc.  Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;    All their attempts to bend thee down  Will but arouse thy generous flame,    And work their woe--but thy renown.      _Rule, Britannia!_ etc.  To thee belongs the rural reign;    Thy cities shall with commerce shine;  All thine shall be the subject main,    And every shore it circles thine.      _Rule, Britannia!_ etc.  The Muses, still with Freedom found,    Shall to thy happy coast repair;  Blest Isle! with matchless beauty crowned,    And manly hearts to guard the fair.      _Rule, Britannia, rule the leaves!      For Britons never will be slaves._JAMES THOMSON.       *       *       *       *       *THE BOWMAN'S SONG.FROM "THE WHITE COMPANY."      What of the bow?    The bow was made in England:  Of true wood, of yew wood,    The wood of English bows;      So men who are free      Love the old yew-tree  And the land where the yew-tree grows.      What of the cord?    The cord was made in England:  A rough cord, a tough cord,    A cord that bowmen love;      So we'll drain our jacks      To the English flax  And the land where the hemp was wove.      What of the shaft?    The shaft was cut in England:  A long shaft, a strong shaft,    Barbed and trim and true;      So we'll drink all together      To the gray goose feather,  And the land where the gray goose flew.      What of the men?    The men were bred in England:  The bowman--the yeoman--    The lads of dale and fell.      Here's to you--and to you!     To the hearts that are true  And the land where the true hearts dwell.SIR A. CONAN DOYLE.       *       *       *       *       *THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND.  When mighty roast beef was the Englishman's food,  It ennobled our hearts, and enriched our blood;  Our soldiers were brave, and our courtiers were good.        _O, the Roast Beef of old England,        And O, the old English Roast Beef_!  But since we have learned from effeminate France  To eat their ragouts, as well as to dance,  We are fed up with nothing but vain complaisance.        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.HENRY FIELDING.       *       *       *       *       *  Our fathers of old were robust, stout, and strong,  And kept open house with good cheer all day long,  Which made their plump tenants rejoice in this song.        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.  When good Queen Elizabeth sat on the throne,  Ere coffee and tea, and such slip-slops, were known,  The world was in terror, if e'en she did frown.        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.  In those days, if fleets did presume on the main,  They seldom or never returned back again;  As witness the vaunting Armada of Spain.        _O, the Roast Beef_, etc.  O, then we had stomachs to eat and to fight,  And when wrongs were cooking, to set ourselves right;  But now we're--hum?--I could, but--good night;        _O, the Roast Beef of old England,           And O, the old English Roast Beef_!_The last four stanzas added by_ RICHARD LOVERIDGE.       *       *       *       *       *THE SNUG LITTLE ISLAND.  Daddy Neptune, one day, to Freedom did say,    If ever I lived upon dry land,  The spot I should hit on would be little Britain!    Says Freedom, "Why, that's my own island!"        O, it's a snug little island!        A right little, tight little island!      Search the globe round, none can be found        So happy as this little island.  Julius Caesar, the Roman, who yielded to no man,    Came by water,--he couldn't come by land;  And Dane, Pict, and Saxon, their homes turned their backs on,    And all for the sake of our island.        O, what a snug little island!        They'd all have a touch at the island!      Some were shot dead, some of them fled,        And some stayed to live on the island.  Then a very great war-man, called Billy the Norman,    Cried, "Drat it, I never liked my land.  It would be much more handy to leave this Normandy,    And live on your beautiful island."        Says he, "'Tis a snug little island;        Sha'n't us go visit the island?"      Hop, skip, and jump, there he was plump,        And he kicked up a dust in the island.  But party deceit helped the Normans to beat;    Of traitors they managed to buy land;  By Dane, Saxon, or Pict, Britons ne'er had been licked,    Had they stuck to the king of their island.        Poor Harold, the king of our island!        He lost both his life and his island!      That's all very true: what more could he do?        Like a Briton he died for his island!  The Spanish armada set out to invade--a,    'Twill sure, if they ever come nigh land.  They couldn't do less than tuck up Queen Bess,    And take their full swing on the island.        O the poor queen of the island!        The Dons came to plunder the island;      But snug in her hive the queen was alive,        And "buzz" was the word of the island.  These proud puffed-up cakes thought to make ducks and drakes    Of our wealth; but they hardly could spy land,  When our Drake had the luck to make their pride duck    And stoop to the lads of the island!        O, for the ships of the island!        The good wooden walls of the island;      Devil or Don, let them come on;        And see how they'd come off the island!  Since Freedom and Neptune have hitherto kept time,    In each saying, "This shall be my land";  Should the "Army of England," or all it could bring, land,    We'd show 'em some play for the island.        We'd fight for our right to the island;        We'd give them enough of the island;      Invaders should just--bite once at the dust,        But not a bit more of the island.THOMAS DIBDIN.       *       *       *       *       *THE JACOBITE ON TOWER HILL.  He tripped up the steps with a bow and a smile,  Offering snuff to the chaplain the while,  A rose at his button-hole that afternoon--  'Twas the tenth of the month, and the month it was June.  Then shrugging his shoulders, he looked at the man  With the mask and the axe, and a murmuring ran  Through the crowd, who below, were all pushing to see  The gaoler kneel down, and receiving his fee.  He looked at the mob, as they roared, with a stare,  And took snuff again with a cynical air.  "I'm happy to give but a moment's delight  To the flower of my country agog for a sight."  Then he looked at the block, and with scented cravat  Dusted room for his neck, gayly doffing his hat,  Kissed his hand to a lady, bent low to the crowd,  Then smiling, turned round to the headsman and bowed.  "God save King James!" he cried bravely and shrill,  And the cry reached the houses at foot of the hill,  "My friend with the axe, _a votre service_," he said;  And ran his white thumb 'long the edge of the blade.  When the multitude hissed he stood firm as a rock;  Then kneeling, laid down his gay head on the block;  He kissed a white rose,--in a moment 'twas red  With the life of the bravest of any that bled.GEORGE WALTER THORNBURY.       *       *       *       *       *GOD SAVE THE KING.  God save our gracious king!  Long live our noble king!    God save the king!  Send him victorious,  Happy and glorious,  Long to reign over us--    God save the king!  O Lord our God, arise!  Scatter his enemies,    And make them fall;  Confound their politics,  Frustrate their knavish tricks;  On him our hopes we fix,    God save us all!  Thy choicest gifts in store  On him be pleased to pour;    Long may he reign.  May he defend our laws,  And ever give us cause,  To sing with heart and voice--    God save the king!HENRY CAREY.       *       *       *       *       *VETERAN AND RECRUIT.  He filled the crystal goblet    With golden-beaded wine:  "Come, comrades, now, I bid ye--    'To the true love of mine!'  "Her forehead's pure and holy,    Her hair is tangled gold,  Her heart to me so tender,    To others' love is cold.  "So drain your glasses empty    And fill me another yet;  Two glasses at least for the dearest    And sweetest girl, Lisette."  Up rose a grizzled sergeant--    "My true love I give thee,  Three true loves blent in one love,    A soldier's trinity.  "Here's to the flag we follow,    Here's to the land we serve,  And here's to holy honor    That doth the two preserve."  Then rose they up around him,    And raised their eyes above,  And drank in solemn silence    Unto the sergeant's love.EDWARD WENTWORTH HAZEWELL.       *       *       *       *       *THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS;[A] OR,THE BRITISH SOLDIER IN CHINA.["Some Seiks, and a private of the Buffs, having remained behind withthe grog carts, fell into the hands of the Chinese. On the next daythey were brought before the authorities and ordered to perform_Kotou_. The Seiks obeyed, but Moyse, the English soldier, declared hewould not prostrate himself before any Chinaman alive, and wasimmediately knocked upon the head, and his body thrown upon adunghill."--_China Correspondent of the London Times.]_  Last night, among his fellow roughs,    He jested, quaffed, and swore;  A drunken private of the Buffs,    Who never looked before.  To-day, beneath the foeman's frown,    He stands in Elgin's place,  Ambassador from Britain's crown,    And type of all her race.  Poor, reckless, rude, low-born, untaught,    Bewildered, and alone,  A heart, with English instinct fraught,    He yet can call his own.  Ay, tear his body limb from limb,    Bring cord or axe or flame,  He only knows that not through him    Shall England come to shame.  Far Kentish hop-fields round him seemed,    Like dreams, to come and go;  Bright leagues of cherry-blossom gleamed,    One sheet of living snow;  The smoke above his father's door    In gray soft eddyings hung;  Must he then watch it rise no more,    Doomed by himself so young?  Yes, honor calls!--with strength like steel    He put the vision by;  Let dusky Indians whine and kneel,    An English lad must die.  And thus, with eyes that would not shrink,    With knee to man unbent,  Unfaltering on its dreadful brink,    To his red grave he went.  Vain mightiest fleets of iron framed,    Vain those all-shattering guns,  Unless proud England keep untamed    The strong heart of her sons;  So let his name through Europe ring,--    A man of mean estate,  Who died, as firm as Sparta's king,    Because his soul was great.[Footnote A: The "Buffs" are the East Kent Regiment.]SIR FRANCIS HASTINGS DOYLE.THE TURK IN ARMENIA.FROM "THE PURPLE EAST."  What profits it, O England, to prevail    In camp and mart and council, and bestrew    With argosies thy oceans, and renew  With tribute levied on each golden gale  Thy treasuries, if thou canst hear the wail    Of women martyred by the turbaned crew,    Whose tenderest mercy was the sword that slew,  And lift no hand to wield the purging flail?    We deemed of old thou held'st a charge from Him    Who watches girdled by his seraphim,  To smite the wronger with thy destined rod.    Wait'st thou his sign? Enough, the unanswered cry    Of virgin souls for vengeance, and on high  The gathering blackness of the frown of God!WILLIAM WATSON.       *       *       *       *       *AVE IMPERATRIX.  Set in this stormy Northern sea,    Queen of these restless fields of tide,  England! what shall men say of thee,    Before whose feet the worlds divide?  The earth, a brittle globe of glass,    Lies in the hollow of thy hand,  And through its heart of crystal pass,    Like shadows through a twilight land,  The spears of crimson-suited war,    The long white-crested waves of fight,  And all the deadly fires which are    The torches of the lords of Night.  The yellow leopards, strained and lean,    The treacherous Russian knows so well,  With gaping blackened jaws are seen    To leap through hail of screaming shell.  The strong sea-lion of England's wars    Hath left his sapphire cave of sea,  To battle with the storm that mars    The star of England's chivalry.  The brazen-throated clarion blows    Across the Pathan's reedy fen,  And the high steeps of Indian snows    Shake to the tread of armed men.  And many an Afghan chief, who lies    Beneath his cool pomegranate-trees,  Clutches his sword in fierce surmise    When on the mountain-side he sees  The fleet-foot Marri scout, who comes    To tell how he hath heard afar  The measured roll of English drums    Beat at the gates of Kandahar.  For southern wind and east wind meet    Where, girt and crowned by sword and fire,  England with bare and bloody feet    Climbs the steep road of wide empire.  O lonely Himalayan height,    Gray pillar of the Indian sky,  Where saw'st thou last in clanging fight    Our winged dogs of Victory?  The almond groves of Samarcand,    Bokhara, where red lilies blow,  And Oxus, by whose yellow sand    The grave white-turbaned merchants go;  And on from thence to Ispahan,    The gilded garden of the sun,  Whence the long dusty caravan    Brings cedar and vermilion;  And that dread city of Cabool    Set at the mountain's scarped feet,  Whose marble tanks are ever full    With water for the noonday heat,  Where through the narrow straight Bazaar    A little maid Circasian  Is led, a present from the Czar    Unto some old and bearded khan,--  Here have our wild war-eagles flown,    And flapped wide wings in fiery flight;  But the sad dove, that sits alone    In England--she hath no delight.  In vain the laughing girl will lean    To greet her love with love-lit eyes:  Down in some treacherous black ravine,    Clutching his flag, the dead boy lies.  And many a moon and sun will see    The lingering wistful children wait  To climb upon their father's knee;    And in each house made desolate  Pale women who have lost their lord    Will kiss the relics of the slain--  Some tarnished epaulette--some sword--    Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain.  For not in quiet English fields    Are these, our brothers, lain to rest,  Where we might deck their broken shields    With all the flowers the dead love best.  For some are by the Delhi walls,    And many in the Afghan land,  And many where the Ganges falls    Through seven mouths of shifting sand.  And some in Russian waters lie,    And others in the seas which are  The portals to the East, or by    The wind-swept heights of Trafalgar.  O wandering graves! O restless sleep!    O silence of the sunless day!  O still ravine! O stormy deep!    Give up your prey! Give up your prey!  And those whose wounds are never healed,    Whose weary race is never won,  O Cromwell's England! must thou yield    For every inch of ground a son?  Go! crown with thorns thy gold-crowned head,    Change thy glad song to song of pain;  Wind and wild wave have got thy dead,    And will not yield them back again.  Wave and wild wind and foreign shore    Possess the flower of English land--  Lips that thy lips shall kiss no more,    Hands that shall never clasp thy hand.  What profit now that we have bound    The whole round world with nets of gold,  If hidden in our heart is found    The care that groweth never old?  What profit that our galleys ride,    Pine-forest like, on every main?  Ruin and wreck are at our side,    Grim warders of the House of pain.  Where are the brave, the strong, the fleet?    Where is our English chivalry?  Wild grasses are their burial-sheet,    And sobbing waves their threnody.  O loved ones lying far away,    What word of love can dead lips send?  O wasted dust! O senseless clay!    Is this the end? is this the end?  Peace, peace! we wrong the noble dead    To vex their solemn slumber so;  Though, childless, and with thorn-crowned head,    Up the steep road must England go,  Yet when this fiery web is spun,    Her watchmen shall descry from far  The young Republic like a sun    Rise from these crimson seas of war.OSCAR WILDE.       *       *       *       *       *AMERICA TO GREAT BRITAIN.

For thou with magic might      Canst reach to where the light      Of Phoebus travels bright      The world o'er!      The genius of our clime        From his pine-embattled steep      Shall hail the guest sublime;        While the Tritons of the deep  With their conchs the kindred league shall proclaim.      Then let the world combine,--      O'er the main our naval line      Like the Milky Way shall shine        Bright in flame!      Though ages long have passed        Since our Fathers left their home,      Their pilot in the blast,        O'er untravelled seas to roam,  Yet lives the blood of England in our veins!      And shall we not proclaim      That blood of honest fame      Which no tyranny can tame        By its chains?      While the language free and bold        Which the Bard of Avon sung,      In which our Milton told        How the vault of heaven rung  When Satan, blasted, fell with his host;      While this, with reverence meet,      Ten thousand echoes greet,      From rock to rock repeat        Round our coast;      While the manners, while the arts,        That mould a nation's soul,      Still cling around our hearts,--        Between let Ocean roll,  Our joint communion breaking with the sun:      Yet still from either beach      The voice of blood shall reach,      More audible than speech,        "We are One."WASHINGTON ALLSTON.       *       *       *       *       *HANDS ALL ROUND.

O Caledonia! stern and wild,  Meet nurse for a poetic child!  Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,  Land of the mountain and the flood,  Land of my sires! what mortal hand  Can e'er untie the filial band  That knits me to thy rugged strand?  Still, as I view each well-known scene,  Think what is now, and what hath been,  Seems, as to me, of all bereft,  Sole friends thy woods and streams were left;  And thus I love them better still,  Even in extremity of ill.  By Yarrow's stream still let me stray,  Though none should guide my feeble way;  Still feel the breeze down Ettrick break,  Although it chilled my withered cheek;  Still lay my head by Teviot stone,  Though there, forgotten and alone,  The bard may draw his parting groan.SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *THE BARD.A PINDARIC ODE.I  "Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!    Confusion on thy banners wait;  Tho' fanned by Conquest's crimson wing,    They mock the air with idle state,  Helm, nor hauberk's twisted mail,  Nor e'en thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail    To save thy secret soul from nightly fears,    From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears!"  Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride    Of the first Edward scattered wild dismay,  As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side    He wound with toilsome march his long array.  Stout Glo'ster stood aghast in speechless trance:  "To arms!" cried Mortimer, and couched his quiv'ring lance.    On a rock, whose haughty brow  Frowns o'er cold Conway's foaming flood,    Robed in the sable garb of woe,  With haggard eyes the poet stood:  (Loose his beard, and hoary hair  Streamed, like a meteor, to the troubled air)  And with a master's hand, and prophet's fire,  Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre.  "Hark how each giant oak, and desert cave,    Sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath!  O'er thee, O King! their hundred arms they wave,    Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe;  Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day,  To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay.    "Cold is Cadwallo's tongue,    That hushed the stormy main:  Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed:    Mountains, ye mourn in vain    Modred, whose magic song  Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head.    On dreary Arvon's shore they lie,  Smeared with gore, and ghastly pale;  Far, far aloof th' affrighted ravens sail;    The famished eagle screams, and passes by.  Dear lost companions of my tuneful art,    Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes,  Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart,    Ye died amidst your dying country's cries--  No more I weep. They do not sleep.   On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,  I see them sit, they linger yet,    Avengers of their native land:  With me in dreadful harmony they join,  And weave with bloody hands the tissues of thy line.II.

Amazement in his van, with Flight combined,  And Sorrow's faded form, and solitude behind.    "Mighty victor, mighty lord!  Low on his funeral couch he lies!    No pitying heart, no eye, afford  A tear to grace his obsequies.  Is the sable warrior fled?  Thy son is gone. He rests among the dead.  The swarm, that in thy noon-tide beam were born,  Gone to salute the rising morn.  Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows.    While proudly riding o'er the azure realm  In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes;    Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;  Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway,  That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening prey.    "Fill high the sparkling bowl,  The rich repast prepare,    Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast;  Close by the regal chair    Fell Thirst and Famine scowl    A baleful smile upon their baffled guest.  Heard ye the din of battle bray,    Lance to lance, and horse to horse?    Long years of havoc, urged their destined course,  And through the kindred squadrons mow their way.    Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,  With many a foul and midnight murder fed,    Revere his consort's faith, his father's fame,  And spare the meek usurper's holy head.  Above, below, the rose of snow,    Twined with her blushing foe, we spread:  The bristled Boar in infant-gore    Wallows beneath the thorny shade.  Now, brothers, bending o'er the accursed loom,  Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.III.    "Edward, lo! to sudden fate  (Weave we the woof. The thread is spun.)    Half of thy heart we consecrate.  (The web is wove. The work is done.)  Stay, oh stay! nor thus forlorn  Leave me unblessed, unpitied, here to mourn:  In yon bright track, that fires the western skies,  They melt, they vanish from my eyes.  But oh! what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height    Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll?  Visions of glory, spare my aching sight!    Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!  No more our long-lost Arthur we bewail.  All hail, ye genuine kings, Britannia's issue, hail!    "Girt with many a baron bold  Sublime their starry fronts they rear;    And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old  In bearded majesty, appear.  In the midst a form divine!  Her eye proclaims her of the Briton line:  Her lion-port, her awe-commanding face,  Attempered sweet to virgin-grace.  What strings symphonious tremble in the air,    What strains of vocal transport round her play!  Hear from the grave, great Taliessin, hear;    They breathe a soul to animate thy clay.  Bright Rapture calls, and soaring as she sings,  Waves in the eye of heaven her many-colored wings.   "The verse adorn again,    Fierce War, and faithful Love,  And Truth severe by fairy fiction drest.    In buskined measure move  Pale Grief and pleasing Pain,  With Horror, tyrant of the throbbing breast.    A voice, as of the cherub-choir,  Gales from blooming Eden bear;  And distant warblings lessen on my ear,    That lost in long futurity expire.  Fond impious man, think'st thou yon sanguine cloud,    Raised by thy breath, has quenched the orb of day?  To-morrow he repairs the golden flood,    And warms the nations with redoubled ray.  Enough for me; with joy I see    The different doom our fates assign.  Be thine Despair, and sceptred Care,    To triumph, and to die, are mine."  He spoke and headlong from the mountain's height  Deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night.THOMAS GRAY.       *       *       *       *       *MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS.  My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here;  My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;  Chasing the wild deer, and following the roe.  My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go.  Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,  The birthplace of valor, the country of worth;  Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,  The hills of the Highlands forever I love.  Farewell to the mountains high covered with snow;  Farewell to the straths and green valleys below;  Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods;  Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.  My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here;  My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;  Chasing the wild deer, and following the roe.  My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go.ROBERT BURNS.       *       *       *       *       *HEATHER ALE: A GALLOWAY LEGEND.  From the bonny bells of heather    They brewed a drink long-syne,  Was sweeter far than honey,    Was stronger far than wine.  They brewed it and they drank it,    And lay in a blessed swound  For days and days together    In the dwellings underground.  There rose a king in Scotland,    A fell man to his foes,  He smote the Picts in battle,    He hunted them like roes.  Over miles of the red mountain    He hunted as they fled,  And strewed the dwarfish bodies    Of the dying and the dead.  Summer came in the country,    Red was the heather bell;  But the manner of the brewing    Was none alive to tell.  In graves that were like children's    On many a mountain head,  The Brewsters of the Heather    Lay numbered with the dead.  The king in the red moorland    Rode on a summer's day;  And the bees hummed, and the curlews    Cried beside the way.  The king rode, and was angry;    Black was his brow and pale,  To rule in a land of heather    And lack the Heather Ale.  It fortuned that his vassals,    Riding free on the heath,  Came on a stone that was fallen    And vermin hid beneath.  Rudely plucked from their hiding,    Never a word they spoke:  A son and his aged father--    Last of the dwarfish folk.  The king sat high on his charger,    He looked on the little men;  And the dwarfish and swarthy couple    Looked at the king again.  Down by the shore he had them;    And there on the giddy brink--  "I will give you life, ye vermin,    For the secret of the drink."  There stood the son and father    And they looked high and low;  The heather was red around them,    The sea rumbled below.  And up and spoke the father,    Shrill was his voice to hear;  "I have a word in private,    A word for the royal ear.  "Life is dear to the aged,    And honor a little thing;  I would gladly sell the secret,"    Quoth the Pict to the King.  His voice was small as a sparrow's,    And shrill and wonderful clear:  "I would gladly sell my secret,    Only my son I fear.  "For life is a little matter,    And death is nought to the young;  And I dare not sell my honor    Under the eye of my son.  Take _him_, O king, and bind him,    And cast him far in the deep;  And it's I will tell the secret.    That I have sworn to keep."  They took the son and bound him,    Neck and heels in a thong,  And a lad took him and swung him,    And flung him far and strong,  And the sea swallowed his body,    Like that of a child of ten;--  And there on the cliff stood the father,    Last of the dwarfish men.  "True as the word I told you:    Only my son I feared;  For I doubt the sapling courage    That goes without the beard.  But now in vain is the torture,    Fire shall never avail:  Here dies in my bosom    The secret of Heather Ale."ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.       *       *       *       *       *THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE.[James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, was executed in Edinburgh, May 21,1650, for an attempt to overthrow the Commonwealth and restore CharlesII.]  Come hither, Evan Cameron!    Come, stand behind my knee--  I hear the river roaring down    Toward the wintry sea.  There's shouting on the mountain-side,    There's war within the blast--  Old faces look upon me,    Old forms go trooping past.  I hear the pibroch wailing    Amidst the din of fight,  And my dim spirit wakes again    Upon the verge of night.  'Twas I that led the Highland host    Through wild Lochaber's snows,  What time the plaided clans came down    To battle with Montrose.  I've told thee how the Southrons fell    Beneath the broad claymore,  And how we smote the Campbell clan    By Inverlochy's shore.  I've told thee how we swept Dundee,    And tamed the Lindsays' pride;  But never have I told thee yet    How the great Marquis died.  A traitor sold him to his foes;--    O deed of deathless shame!  I charge thee, boy, if e'er thou meet    With one of Assynt's name--  Be it upon the mountain's side,    Or yet within the glen,  Stand he in martial gear alone,    Or backed by armed men--  Face him as thou wouldst face the man    Who wronged thy sire's renown;  Remember of what blood thou art,    And strike the caitiff down!  They brought him to the Watergate,    Hard bound with hempen span.  As though they held a lion there,    And not a 'fenceless man.  They set him high upon a cart--    The hangman rode below--  They drew his hands behind his back,    And bared his noble brow.  Then, as a hound is slipped from leash,    They cheered the common throng,  And blew the note with yell and shout,    And bade him pass along.  It would have made a brave man's heart    Grow sad and sick that day.  To watch the keen, malignant eyes    Bent down on that array.  There stood the Whig west-country lords    In balcony and bow;  There sat their gaunt and withered dames,    And their daughters all a-row.  And every open window    Was full as full might be  With black-robed Covenanting carles,    That goodly sport to see!  But when he came, though pale and wan,    He looked so great and high,  So noble was his manly front,    So calm his steadfast eye;--  The rabble rout forbore to shout,    And each man held his breath,  For well they knew the hero's soul    Was face to face with death.  And then a mournful shudder    Through all the people crept,  And some that came to scoff at him    Now turned aside and wept.  But onward--always onward,    In silence and in gloom,  The dreary pageant labored,    Till it reached the house of doom.  Then first a woman's voice was heard    In jeer and laughter loud,  And an angry cry and a hiss arose    From the heart of the tossing crowd:  Then, as the Graeme looked upward,    He saw the ugly smile  Of him who sold his king for gold--    The master-fiend Argyle!  The Marquis gazed a moment,    And nothing did he say,  But the cheek of Argyle grew ghastly pale,    And he turned his eyes away.  The painted harlot by his side,    She shook through every limb,  For a roar like thunder swept the street,    And hands were clenched at him;  And a Saxon soldier cried aloud,    "Back, coward, from thy place!  For seven long years thou hast not dared    To look him in the face."  Had I been there with sword in hand,    And fifty Camerons by,  That day through high Dunedin's streets    Had pealed the slogan-cry.  Not all their troops of trampling horse,    Nor might of mailed men--  Not all the rebels in the south    Had borne us backward then!  Once more his foot on Highland heath    Had trod as free as air,  Or I, and all who bore my name,    Been laid around him there!  It might not be. They placed him next    Within the solemn hall,  Where once the Scottish kings were throned    Amidst their nobles all.  But there was dust of vulgar feet    On that polluted floor,  And perjured traitors filled the place    Where good men sate before.  With savage glee came Warriston    To read the murderous doom;  And then uprose the great Montrose    In the middle of the room:  "Now, by my faith as belted knight    And by the name I bear,  And by the bright St. Andrew's cross    That waves above us there--  Yea, by a greater, mightier oath--    And O that such should be!--  By that dark stream of royal blood    That lies 'twixt you and me--  I have not sought in battle-field    A wreath of such renown,  Nor dared I hope on my dying day    To win the martyr's crown!  "There is a chamber far away    Where sleep the good and brave,  But a better place ye have named for me    Than by my father's grave.  For truth and right, 'gainst treason's might,    This hand has always striven,  And ye raise it up for a witness still    In the eye of earth and heaven.  Then nail my head on yonder tower--    Give every town a limb--  And God who made shall gather them:    I go from you to Him!"  The morning dawned full darkly,    The rain came flashing down,  And the jagged streak of the levin bolt    Lit up the gloomy town.  The thunder crashed across the heaven,    The fatal hour was come;  Yet aye broke in, with muffled beat,    The 'larum of the drum.  There was madness on the earth below    And anger in the sky,  And young and old, and rich and poor,    Came forth to see him die.  Ah God! that ghastly gibbet!    How dismal 'tis to see  The great tall spectral skeleton,    The ladder and the tree!  Hark! hark! it is the clash of arms,--    The bells begin to toll,--  "He is coming! he is coming!    God's mercy on his soul!"  One last long peal of thunder,--    The clouds are cleared away.  And the glorious sun once more looks down    Amidst the dazzling day.  "He is coming! he is coming!"    Like a bridegroom from his room  Came the hero from his prison    To the scaffold and the doom.  There was glory on his forehead,    There was lustre in his eye,  And he never walked to battle    More proudly than to die.  There was color in his visage,    Though the cheeks of all were wan;  And they marvelled as they saw him pass,    That great and goodly man!  He mounted up the scaffold,    And he turned him to the crowd;  But they dared not trust the people,    So he might not speak aloud.  But he looked upon the heavens,    And they were clear and blue,  And in the liquid ether    The eye of God shone through:  Yet a black and murky battlement    Lay resting on the hill,  As though the thunder slept within,--    All else was calm and still.  The grim Geneva ministers    With anxious scowl drew near,  As you have seen the ravens flock    Around the dying deer.  He would not deign them word nor sign,    But alone he bent the knee;  And veiled his face for Christ's dear grace    Beneath the gallows-tree.  Then, radiant and serene, he rose,    And cast his cloak away;  For he had ta'en his latest look    Of earth and sun and day.  A beam of light fell o'er him,    Like a glory round the shriven,  And he climbed the lofty ladder    As it were the path to heaven.  Then came a flash from out the cloud,    And a stunning thunder-roll;  And no man dared to look aloft,--    Fear was on every soul.  There was another heavy sound,    A hush, and then a groan;  And darkness swept across the sky,--    The work of death was done!WILLIAM EDMONDSTOUNE AYTOUN.       *       *       *       *       *BORDER BALLAD.  March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale!    Why the de'il dinna ye march forward in order?  March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdale!    All the Blue Bonnets are over the Border!            Many a banner spread            Flutters above your head,  Many a crest that is famous in story!--            Mount and make ready, then,            Sons of the mountain glen,  Fight for the queen and our old Scottish glory.  Come from the hills where your hirsels are grazing;    Come from the glen of the buck and the roe;  Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing;    Come with the buckler, the lance, and the bow.            Trumpets are sounding;            War-steeds are bounding;  Stand to your arms, and march in good order,             England shall many a day             Tell of the bloody fray,  When the Blue Bonnets came over the Border.SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *THE EXILE'S SONG.  Oh! why left I my hame?    Why did I cross the deep?  Oh! why left I the land    Where my forefathers sleep?  I sigh for Scotia's shore,    And I gaze across the sea,  But I canna get a blink    O' my ain countrie.  The palm-tree waveth high,    And fair the myrtle springs;  And, to the Indian maid,    The bulbul sweetly sings.  But I dinna see the broom    Wi' its tassels on the lee,  Nor hear the lintie's sang    O' my ain countrie.  Oh! here no Sabbath bell    Awakes the Sabbath morn,  Nor song of reapers heard    Among the yellow corn:  For the tyrant's voice is here,    And the wail of slaverie;  But the sun of freedom shines    In my ain countrie.  There's a hope for every woe,    And a balm for every pain,  But the first joys o' our heart    Come never back again.  There's a track upon the deep,    And a path across the sea:  But the weary ne'er return    To their ain countrie.ROBERT GILFILLAN.       *       *       *       *       *THE IRISHMAN.  The savage loves his native shore,    Though rude the soil and chill the air;  Then well may Erin's sons adore    Their isle which nature formed so fair,  What flood reflects a shore so sweet    As Shannon great or pastoral Bann?  Or who a friend or foe can meet    So generous as an Irishman?  His hand is rash, his heart is warm,    But honesty is still his guide;  None more repents a deed of harm,    And none forgives with nobler pride;  He may be duped, but won't be dared--    More fit to practise than to plan;  He dearly earns his poor reward,    And spends it like an Irishman.  If strange or poor, for you he'll pay,    And guide to where you safe may be;  If you're his guest, while e'er you stay,    His cottage holds a jubilee.  His inmost soul he will unlock,    And if he may _your_ secrets scan,  Your confidence he scorns to mock,    For faithful is an Irishman.  By honor bound in woe or weal,    Whate'er she bids he dares to do;  Try him with bribes--they won't prevail;    Prove him in fire--you'll find him true.  He seeks not safety, let his post    Be where it ought in danger's van;  And if the field of fame be lost,    It won't be by an Irishman.  Erin! loved land! from age to age,    Be thou more great, more famed, and free,  May peace be thine, or shouldst thou wage    Defensive war, cheap victory.  May plenty bloom in every field    Which gentle breezes softly fan,  And cheerful smiles serenely gild    The home of every Irishman.JAMES ORR.       *       *       *       *       *TURLOUGH MACSWEENEY._A health to you, Piper,     And your pipes silver-tongued, clear and sweet in their crooning_!  Full of the music they gathered at morn    On your high heather hills from the lark on the wing,  From the blackbird at eve on the blossoming thorn,    From the little green linnet whose plaining they sing,  And the joy and the hope in the heart of the Spring,        O, Turlough MacSweeney!  Play us our Eire's most sorrowful songs,    As she sits by her reeds near the wash of the wave,  That the coldest may thrill at the count of her wrongs,    That the sword may flash forth from the scabbard to save,  And the wide land awake at the wrath of the brave,        O, Turlough MacSweeney!  Play as the bards played in days long ago,    When O'Donnell, arrayed for the foray or feast,  With your kinsmen from Bannat and Fannat and Doe,    With piping and harping, and blessing of priest,  Rode out in the blaze of the sun from the East,            O, Turlough MacSweeney!  Play as they played in that rapturous hour    When the clans heard in gladness his young fiery call  Who burst from the gloom of the Sassenach tower,    And sped to the welcome in dear Donegal,  Then on to his hailing as chieftain of all--            O, Turlough MacSweeney!  Play as they played, when, a trumpet of war,    His voice for the rally, pealed up to the blue,  And the kerns from the hills and the glens and the scaur    Marched after the banner of conquering Hugh--  Led into the fray by a piper like you,            O, Turlough MacSweeney!  And surely no note of such music shall fail,    Wherever the speech of our Eire is heard,  To foster the hope of the passionate Gael,    To fan the old hatred, relentless when stirred,  To strengthen our souls for the strife to be dared,            O, Turlough MacSweeney!  _May your pipes, silver-tongued, clear and sweet in their crooning,  Keep the magic they captured at dawning and even  From the blackbird at home, and the lark on its journey,  From the thrush on its spray, and the little green linnet.            A health to you, Piper!_ANNA MACMANUS (_Ethna Carbery_).       *       *       *       *       *A SPINNING SONG.      My love to fight the Saxon goes,        And bravely shines his sword of steel;      A heron's feather decks his brows,        And a spur on either heel;      His steed is blacker than the sloe,        And fleeter than the falling star;      Amid the surging ranks he'll go        And shout for joy of war.  Twinkle, twinkle, pretty spindle; let the white wool drift and dwindle.    Oh! we weave a damask doublet for my love's coat of steel.  Hark! the timid, turning treadle crooning soft, old-fashioned ditties    To the low, slow murmur of the brown round wheel.      My love is pledged to Ireland's fight;        My love would die for Ireland's weal,      To win her back her ancient right,        And make her foemen reel.      Oh! close I'll clasp him to my breast        When homeward from the war he comes;      The fires shall light the mountain's crest,        The valley peal with drums.  Twinkle, twinkle, pretty spindle; let the white wool drift and dwindle.    Oh! we weave a damask doublet for my love's coat of steel.  Hark! the timid, turning treadle crooning soft old-fashioned ditties    To the low, slow murmur of the brown round wheel.JOHN FRANCIS O'DONNELL.       *       *       *       *       *THE WEARING OF THE GREEN.[A][Footnote A: Variation of an old street song of about 1798. Sung in DionBoucicault's play "The Shan Van Voght."]  O Paddy dear, an' did you hear the news that's goin' round?  The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground;  St. Patrick's Day no more we'll keep; his colors can't be seen:  For there's a cruel law agin' the wearin' of the green.  I met with Napper Tandy, and he tuk me by the hand,  And he said, "How's poor ould Ireland, and how does she stand?"  She's the most distressful country that ever yet was seen:  They are hangin' men and women there for wearin' of the green.  An' if the color we must wear is England's cruel red,  Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they have shed.  Then pull the shamrock from your hat and cast it on the sod,  And never fear, 'twill take root there, though under foot 'tis trod.  When law can stop the blades of grass from growin' as they grow,  And when the leaves in summer-time their color dare not show,  Then I will change the color, too, I wear in my caubeen;  But till that day, please God, I'll stick to wearin' of the green.  But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart,  Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old isle will part:  I've heard a whisper of a land that lies beyond the sea,  Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's day.  O Erin, must we leave you, driven by a tyrant's hand?  Must we ask a mother's blessin' from a strange and distant land?  Where the cruel cross of England shall nevermore be seen,  And where, please God, we'll live and die still wearin' of the green.       *       *       *       *       *MY NATIVE LAND.  It chanced to me upon a time to sail    Across the Southern ocean to and fro;  And, landing at fair isles, by stream and vale    Of sensuous blessing did we ofttimes go.  And months of dreamy joys, like joys in sleep,    Or like a clear, calm stream o'er mossy stone,  Unnoted passed our hearts with voiceless sweep,    And left us yearning still for lands unknown.  And when we found one,--for 'tis soon to find    In thousand-isled Cathay another isle,--  For one short noon its treasures filled the mind,    And then again we yearned, and ceased to smile.  And so it was from isle to isle we passed,    Like wanton bees or boys on flowers or lips;  And when that all was tasted, then at last    We thirsted still for draughts instead of sips.  I learned from this there is no Southern land    Can fill with love the hearts of Northern men.  Sick minds need change; but, when in health they stand    'Neath foreign skies, their love flies home agen.  And thus with me it was: the yearning turned    From laden airs of cinnamon away,  And stretched far westward, while the full heart burned    With love for Ireland, looking on Cathay!  My first dear love, all dearer for thy grief!    My land, that has no peer in all the sea  For verdure, vale, or river, flower or leaf,--    If first to no man else, thou'rt first to me.  New loves may come with duties, but the first    Is deepest yet,--the mother's breath and smiles;  Like that kind face and breast where I was nursed    Is my poor land, the Niobe of isles.JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY.       *       *       *       *       *BLESS THE DEAR OLD VERDANT LAND.  Bless the dear old verdant land!    Brother, wert thou born of it?  As thy shadow life doth stand  Twining round its rosy band.  Did an Irish mother's hand    Guide thee in the morn of it?  Did a father's first command    Teach thee love or scorn of it?  Thou who tread'st its fertile breast,    Dost thou feel a glow for it?  Thou of all its charms possest.  Living on its first and best,  Art thou but a thankless guest    Or a traitor foe for it,  If thou lovest, where's the test?    Wilt thou strike a blow for it?  Has the past no goading sting    That can make thee rouse for it?  Does thy land's reviving spring,  Full of buds and blossoming,  Fail to make thy cold heart cling,    Breathing lover's vows for it?  With the circling ocean's ring    Thou wert made a spouse for it.  Hast thou kept as thou shouldst keep    Thy affections warm for it,  Letting no cold feeling creep  Like an ice-breath o'er the deep,  Freezing to a stony sleep    Hopes the heart would form for it,  Glories that like rainbows peep    Through the darkening storm for it?  Son of this down-trodden land,    Aid us in the fight for it.  We seek to make it great and grand,  Its shipless bays, its naked strand,  By canvas-swelling breezes fanned:    Oh, what a glorious sight for it,  The past expiring like a brand    In morning's rosy light for it!  Think, this dear old land is thine,    And thou a traitor slave of it:  Think how the Switzer leads his kine,  When pale the evening star doth shine;  His song has home in every line,    Freedom in every stave of it;  Think how the German loves his Rhine    And worships every wave of it!  Our own dear land is bright as theirs,    But oh! our hearts are cold for it;  Awake! we are not slaves, but heirs.  Our fatherland requires our cares,  Our speech with men, with God our prayers;    Spurn blood-stained Judas gold for it:  Let us do all that honor dares--    Be earnest, faithful, bold for it!DENIS FLORENCE MAC CARTHY.       *       *       *       *       *IRELAND.[1847.]  They are dying! they are dying! where the golden corn is growing;  They are dying! they are dying! where the crowded herds are lowing:  They are gasping for existence where the streams of life are flowing,  And they perish of the plague where the breeze of health is blowing!  God of justice! God of power!    Do we dream? Can it be,  In this land, at this hour,    With the blossom on the tree,  In the gladsome month of May,  When the young lambs play,  When Nature looks around    On her waking children now,  The seed within the ground,    The bud upon the bough?  Is it right, is it fair,  That we perish of despair  In this land, on this soil,    Where our destiny is set,  Which we cultured with our toil,    And watered with our sweat?  We have ploughed, we have sown  But the crop was not our own;  We have reaped, but harpy hands  Swept the harvest from our lands;  We were perishing for food,  When lo! in pitying mood,  Our kindly rulers gave  The fat fluid of the slave,  While our corn filled the manger  Of the war-horse of the stranger!  God of mercy! must this last?    Is this land preordained,  For the present and the past    And the future, to be chained,--    To be ravaged, to be drained,  To be robbed, to be spoiled,    To be hushed, to be whipt,    Its soaring pinions clipt,  And its every effort foiled?  Do our numbers multiply  But to perish and to die?    Is this all our destiny below,--  That our bodies, as they rot,  May fertilize the spot    Where the harvests of the stranger grow?    If this be, indeed, our fate,    Far, far better now, though late,  That we seek some other land and try some other zone;    The coldest, bleakest shore    Will surely yield us more  Than the storehouse of the stranger that we dare not call our own.    Kindly brothers of the West,    Who from Liberty's full breast  Have fed us, who are orphans beneath a step-dame's frown,    Behold our happy state,    And weep your wretched fate  That you share not in the splendors of our empire and our crown!    Kindly brothers of the East,--    Thou great tiaraed priest,  Thou sanctified Rienzi of Rome and of the earth,--    Or thou who bear'st control    Over golden Istambol,  Who felt for our misfortunes and helped us in our dearth,--    Turn here your wondering eyes,    Call your wisest of the wise,  Your muftis and your ministers, your men of deepest lore;    Let the sagest of your sages    Ope our island's mystic pages,  And explain unto your highness the wonders of our shore.    A fruitful, teeming soil,    Where the patient peasants toil  Beneath the summer's sun and the watery winter sky;    Where they tend the golden grain    Till it bends upon the plain,  Then reap it for the stranger, and turn aside to die;    Where they watch their flocks increase,    And store the snowy fleece  Till they send it to their masters to be woven o'er the waves;    Where, having sent their meat    For the foreigner to eat,  Their mission is fulfilled, and they creep into their graves.  'Tis for this they are dying where the golden corn is growing,  'Tis for this they are dying where the crowded herds are lowing,  'Tis for this they are dying where the streams of life are flowing,  And they perish of the plague where the breeze of health is blowing!DENIS FLORENCE MACCARTHY.       *       *       *       *       *IRELAND.A SEASIDE PORTRAIT.  A great, still Shape, alone,   She sits (her harp has fallen) on the sand,  And sees her children, one by one, depart:--  Her cloak (that hides what sins beside her own!)   Wrapped fold on fold about her. Lo,    She comforts her fierce heart,  As wailing some, and some gay-singing go,  With the far vision of that Greater Land    Deep in the Atlantic skies,    Saint Brandan's Paradise!    Another Woman there,   Mighty and wondrous fair,  Stands on her shore-rock:--one uplifted hand    Holds a quick-piercing light    That keeps long sea-ways bright;  She beckons with the other, saying "Come,    O landless, shelterless,  Sharp-faced with hunger, worn with long distress:--    Come hither, finding home!  Lo, my new fields of harvest, open, free,    By winds of blessing blown,  Whose golden corn-blades shake from sea to sea--  Fields without walls that all the people own!"JOHN JAMES PIATT       *       *       *       *       *EXILE OF ERIN.  There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,   The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;  For his country he sighed, when at twilight repairing   To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.  But the day-star attracted his eye's sad devotion,  For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,  Where once, in the fire of his youthful emotion,   He sang the bold anthem of Erin go bragh.  Sad is my fate! said the heart-broken stranger;   The wild deer and wolf to a covert can flee,  But I have no refuge from famine and danger,   A home and a country remain not to me.  Never again in the green sunny bowers  Where my forefathers lived shall I spend the sweet hours,  Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers,   And strike to the numbers of Erin go bragh!  Erin, my country! though sad and forsaken,   In dreams I revisit thy sea-beaten shore;  But, alas! in a far foreign land I awaken,   And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more!  O cruel fate! wilt thou never replace me  In a mansion of peace, where no perils can chase me?  Never again shall my brothers embrace me?   They died to defend me, or live to deplore!  Where is my cabin door, fast by the wildwood?   Sisters and sire, did ye weep for its fall?  Where is the mother that looked on my childhood?   And where is the bosom-friend, dearer than all?  O my sad heart! long abandoned by pleasure,  Why did it dote on a fast-fading treasure?  Tears, like the rain-drop, may fall without measure,   But rapture and beauty they cannot recall.  Yet, all its sad recollections suppressing,   One dying wish my lone bosom can draw,--  Erin, an exile bequeaths thee his blessing!   Land of my forefathers, Erin go bragh!  Buried and cold, when my heart stills her motion,  Green be thy fields, sweetest isle of the ocean!  And thy harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotion,--   Erin mavourneen, Erin go bragh![A][Footnote A: Ireland my darling, Ireland forever!]THOMAS CAMPBELL.       *       *       *       *       *AFTER DEATH.  Shall mine eyes behold thy glory, O my country?   Shall mine eyes behold thy glory?  Or shall the darkness close around them, ere the   sun-blaze breaks at last upon thy story?  When the nations ope for thee their queenly circle,   as a sweet new sister hail thee,  Shall these lips be sealed in callous death and    silence, that have known but to bewail thee?  Shall the ear be deaf that only loved thy praises,    when all men their tribute bring thee?  Shall the mouth be clay that sang thee in thy    squalor, when all poets' mouths shall sing thee?  Ah, the harpings and the salvos and the shoutings    of thy exiled sons returning!  I should hear, though dead and mouldered, and    the grave-damps should not chill my bosom's burning.  Ah, the tramp of feet victorious! I should hear    them 'mid the shamrocks and the mosses,  And my heart should toss within the shroud and    quiver as a captive dreamer tosses.  I should turn and rend the cere-clothes round me,    giant sinews I should borrow--  Crying, "O my brothers, I have also loved her in    her loneliness and sorrow.  "Let me join with you the jubilant procession;    let me chant with you her story;  Then contented I shall go back to the shamrocks,    now mine eyes have seen her glory!"FRANCES ISABEL PARNELL.       *       *       *       *       *CANADA NOT LAST.AT VENICE.  Lo Venice, gay with color, lights and song,    Calls from St. Mark's with ancient voice and strange:  I am the Witch of Cities! glide along    My silver streets that never wear by change  Of years: forget the years, and pain, and wrong,  And ever sorrow reigning men among.    Know I can soothe thee, please and marry thee  To my illusions. Old and siren strong,    I smile immortal, while the mortals flee    Who whiten on to death in wooing me.AT FLORENCE.  Say, what more fair by Arno's bridged gleam    Than Florence, viewed from San Miniato's slope  At eventide, when west along the stream    The last of day reflects a silver hope!--  Lo, all else softened in the twilight beam:--  The city's mass blent in one hazy cream,    The brown Dome 'midst it, and the Lily tower,  And stern Old Tower more near, and hills that seem    Afar, like clouds to fade, and hills of power    On this side greenly dark with cypress, vine and bower.AT ROME.  End of desire to stray I feel would come    Though Italy were all fair skies to me,  Though France's fields went mad with flowery foam    And Blanc put on a special majesty,  Not all could match the growing thought of home  Nor tempt to exile. Look I not on Rome--    This ancient, modern, mediaeval queen--  Yet still sigh westward over hill and dome,    Imperial ruin and villa's princely scene    Lovely with pictured saints and marble gods serene.REFLECTION.  Rome, Florence, Venice--noble, fair and quaint,    They reign in robes of magic round me here;  But fading, blotted, dim, a picture faint,    With spell more silent, only pleads a tear.  Plead not! Thou hast my heart, O picture dim!    I see the fields, I see the autumn hand  Of God upon the maples! Answer Him    With weird, translucent glories, ye that stand  Like spirits in scarlet and in amethyst!  I see the sun break over you: the mist    On hills that lift from iron bases grand    Their heads superb!--the dream, it is my native land.WILLIAM DOUW SCHUYLER-LIGHTHALL.       *       *       *       *       *CANADA.  O child of Nations, giant-limbed,    Who stand'st among the nations now,  Unheeded, unadored, unhymned,    With unanointed brow:  How long the ignoble sloth, how long    The trust in greatness not thine own?  Surely the lion's brood is strong    To front the world alone!  How long the indolence, ere thou dare    Achieve thy destiny, seize thy fame;  Ere our proud eyes behold thee bear    A nation's franchise, nation's name?  The Saxon force, the Celtic fire,    These are thy manhood's heritage!  Why rest with babes and slaves? Seek higher    The place of race and age.  I see to every wind unfurled    The flag that bears the Maple-Wreath;  Thy swift keels furrow round the world    Its blood-red folds beneath;  Thy swift keels cleave the furthest seas;    Thy white sails swell with alien gales;  To stream on each remotest breeze    The black smoke of thy pipes exhales.  O Falterer, let thy past convince    Thy future: all the growth, the gain,  The fame since Cartier knew thee, since    Thy shores beheld Champlain!  Montcalm and Wolfe! Wolfe and Montcalm!    Quebec, thy storied citadel  Attest in burning song and psalm    How here thy heroes fell!  O Thou that bor'st the battle's brunt    At Queenstown, and at Lundy's Lane:  On whose scant ranks but iron front    The battle broke in vain!  Whose was the danger, whose the day,    From whose triumphant throats the cheers,  At Chrysler's Farm, at Chateauguay,    Storming like clarion-bursts our ears?  On soft Pacific slopes,--beside    Strange floods that northward rave and fall,  Where chafes Acadia's chainless tide,--    Thy sons await thy call.  They wait; but some in exile, some    With strangers housed, in stranger lands;  And some Canadian lips are dumb    Beneath Egyptian sands.  O mystic Nile! Thy secret yields    Before us; thy most ancient dreams  Are mixed with far Canadian fields    And murmur of Canadian streams.  But thou, my Country, dream not thou!    Wake, and behold how night is done,--  How on thy breast, and o'er thy brow,    Bursts the uprising sun!CHARLES G.D. ROBERTS.       *       *       *       *       *WHAT IS THE GERMAN'S FATHERLAND?

God, who gave iron, purposed ne'er    That man should be a slave:  Therefore the sabre, sword, and spear    In his right hand He gave.  Therefore He gave him fiery mood,    Fierce speech, and free-born breath,  That he might fearlessly the feud    Maintain through life and death.  Therefore will we what God did say,    With honest truth maintain,  And ne'er a fellow-creature slay,    A tyrant's pay to gain!  But he shall fall by stroke of brand    Who fights for sin and shame,  And not inherit German land    With men of German name.  O Germany, bright fatherland!    O German love, so true!  Thou sacred land, thou beauteous land,    We swear to thee anew!  Outlawed, each knave and coward shall    The crow and raven feed;  But we will to the battle all--    Revenge shall be our meed.  Flash forth, flash forth, whatever can,    To bright and flaming life!  Now all ye Germans, man for man,    Forth to the holy strife!  Your hands lift upward to the sky--    Your heart shall upward soar--  And man for man, let each one cry,    Our slavery is o'er!  Let sound, let sound, whatever can,    Trumpet and fife and drum,  This day our sabres, man for man,    To stain with blood we come;  With hangman's and with Frenchmen's blood,    O glorious day of ire,  That to all Germans soundeth good--    Day of our great desire!  Let wave, let wave, whatever can,    Standard and banner wave!  Here will we purpose, man for man,    To grace a hero's grave.

Forth in the van,      Man by man,    Swing the battle-sword who can!  When we stand watching, the livelong night,  Through piping storms, till morning light,  Thou to thy downy bed canst creep,  And there in dreams of rapture sleep.    A graceless, worthless wight, etc.  When, hoarse and shrill, the trumpet's blast.  Like the thunder of God, makes our heart beat fast,  Thou in the theatre lov'st to appear,  Where trills and quavers tickle the ear.    A graceless, worthless wight, etc.  When the glare of noonday scorches the brain,  When our parched lips seek water in vain,  Thou canst make champagne corks fly  At the groaning tables of luxury.    A graceless, worthless wight, etc.  When we, as we rush to the strangling fight,  Send home to our true-loves a long "Good-night,"  Thou canst hie thee where love is sold,  And buy thy pleasure with paltry gold.    A graceless, worthless wight, etc.  When lance and bullet come whistling by,  And death in a thousand shapes draws nigh,  Thou canst sit at thy cards, and kill  King, queen, and knave with thy spadille.

Thy pampered flesh shall quake at its doom,  And crawl in silk to a hopeless tomb.

In my mouth the words are melting,  From my lips the tones are gliding,  From my tongue they wish to hasten;  When my willing teeth are parted,  When my ready mouth is opened,  Songs of ancient wit and wisdom  Hasten from me not unwilling.    Golden friend, and dearest brother,  Brother dear of mine in childhood,  Come and sing with me the stories,  Come and chant with me the legends,  Legends of the times forgotten,  Since we now are here together,  Come together from our roamings.  Seldom do we come for singing,  Seldom to the one, the other,  O'er this cold and cruel country,  O'er the poor soil of the Northland.  Let us clasp our hands together,  That we thus may best remember.  Join we now in merry singing,  Chant we now the oldest folk-lore,  That the dear ones all may hear them,  That the well-inclined may hear them,  Of this rising generation.  These are words in childhood taught me,  Songs preserved from distant ages;  Legends they that once were taken  From the belt of Wainamoinen,  From the forge of Ilmarinen,  From the sword of Kaukomieli,  From the bow of Youkahainen,  From the pastures of the Northland,  From the meads of Kalevala.  These my dear old father sang me  When at work with knife and hatchet:  These my tender mother taught me  When she twirled the flying spindle,  When a child upon the matting  By her feet I rolled and tumbled.    Incantations were not wanting  Over Sampo and o'er Louhi,  Sampo growing old in singing,  Louhi ceasing her enchantment.  In the songs died wise Wipunen,  At the games died Lemminkainen.  There are many other legends,  Incantations that were taught me,  That I found along the wayside,  Gathered in the fragrant copses,  Blown me from the forest branches,  Culled among the plumes of pine-trees,  Scented from the vines and flowers,  Whispered to me as I followed  Flocks in land of honeyed meadows,  Over hillocks green and golden,  After sable-haired Murikki,  And the many-colored Kimmo.  Many runes the cold has told me,  Many lays the rain has brought me,  Other songs the winds have sung me;  Many birds from many forests,  Oft have sung me lays in concord;  Waves of sea, and ocean billows,  Music from the many waters,  Music from the whole creation,  Oft have been my guide and master.  Sentences the trees created,  Rolled together into bundles,  Moved them to my ancient dwelling,  On the sledges to my cottage,  Tied them to my garret rafters,  Hung them on my dwelling-portals,  Laid them in a chest of boxes,  Boxes lined with shining copper.  Long they lay within my dwelling  Through the chilling winds of winter,  In my dwelling-place for ages.    Shall I bring these songs together?  From the cold and frost collect them?  Shall I bring this nest of boxes,  Keepers of these golden legends,  To the table in my cabin,  Underneath the painted rafters,  In this house renowned and ancient?  Shall I now these boxes open,  Boxes filled with wondrous stories?  Shall I now the end unfasten  Of this ball of ancient wisdom?  These ancestral lays unravel?  Let me sing an old-time legend,  That shall echo forth the praises  Of the beer that I have tasted,  Of the sparkling beer of barley,  Bring to me a foaming goblet  Of the barley of my fathers,  Lest my singing grow too weary,  Singing from the water only.  Bring me too a cup of strong beer;  It will add to our enchantment,  To the pleasure of the evening,  Northland's long and dreary evening,  For the beauty of the day-dawn,  For the pleasures of the morning,  The beginning of the new day.From the FINNISH.Translation of JOHN MARTIN CRAWFORD.       *       *       *       *       *PARTING LOVERS.SIENNA.  I love thee, love thee, Giulio!    Some call me cold, and some demure,  And if thou hast ever guessed that so    I love thee ... well;--the proof was poor,    And no one could be sure.  Before thy song (with shifted rhymes     To suit my name) did I undo  The persian? If it moved sometimes,    Thou hast not seen a hand push through    A flower or two.  My mother listening to my sleep    Heard nothing but a sigh at night,--  The short sigh rippling on the deep,--    When hearts run out of breath and sigh    Of men, to God's clear light.  When others named thee,... thought thy brows    Were straight, thy smile was tender,... "Here  He comes between the vineyard-rows!"--    I said not "Ay,"--nor waited, Dear,    To feel thee step too near.  I left such things to bolder girls,    Olivia or Clotilda. Nay,  When that Clotilda through her curls    Held both thine eyes in hers one day,    I marvelled, let me say.  I could not try the woman's trick:    Between us straightway fell the blush  Which kept me separate, blind, and sick.    A wind came with thee in a flush,    As blow through Horeb's bush.  But now that Italy invokes    Her young men to go forth and chase  The foe or perish,--nothing chokes    My voice, or drives me from the place:    I look thee in the face.  I love thee! it is understood,    Confest: I do not shrink or start:  No blushes: all my body's blood    Has gone to greaten this poor heart,    That, loving, we may part.  Our Italy invokes the youth    To die if need be. Still there's room,  Though earth is strained with dead, in truth.    Since twice the lilies were in bloom    They had not grudged a tomb.  And many a plighted maid and wife    And mother, who can say since then  "My country," cannot say through life    "My son," "my spouse," "my flower of men,"    And not weep dumb again.  Heroic males the country bears,    But daughters give up more than sons.  Flags wave, drums beat, and unawares    You flash your souls out with the guns,    And take your heaven at once!  But we,--we empty heart and home     Of life's life, love! we bear to think  You're gone,... to feel you may not come,...     To hear the door-latch stir and clink     Yet no more you,... nor sink.  Dear God! when Italy is one     And perfected from bound to bound,...  Suppose (for my share) earth's undone     By one grave in't! as one small wound     May kill a man, 'tis found!  What then? If love's delight must end,     At least we'll clear its truth from flaws.  I love thee, love thee, sweetest friend!     Now take my sweetest without pause,     To help the nation's cause.  And thus of noble Italy     We'll both be worthy. Let her show  The future how we made her free,     Not sparing life, nor Giulio,     Nor this ... this heart-break.

They know not, in their hate and pride,  What virtues with thy children bide,--  How true, how good, thy graceful maids  Make bright, like flowers, the valley shades;      What generous men  Spring, like thine oaks, by hill and glen;  What cordial welcomes greet the guest  By thy lone rivers of the west;  How faith is kept, and truth revered,  And man is loved, and God is feared,      In woodland homes,  And where the ocean border foams.  There's freedom at thy gates, and rest  For earth's down-trodden and opprest,  A shelter for the hunted head,  For the starved laborer toil and bread.      Power, at thy bounds,  Stops, and calls back his baffled hounds.  O fair young mother! on thy brow  Shall sit a nobler grace than now.  Deep in the brightness of thy skies,  The thronging years in glory rise,      And, as they fleet,  Drop strength and riches at thy feet.  Thine eye, with every coming hour,  Shall brighten, and thy form shall tower;  And when thy sisters, elder born,  Would brand thy name with words of scorn,      Before thine eye  Upon their lips the taunt shall die.WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.       *       *       *       *       *COLUMBIA.  Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,  The queen of the world, and the child of the skies!  Thy genius commands thee; with rapture behold,  While ages on ages thy splendors unfold.  Thy reign is the last and the noblest of time,  Most fruitful thy soil, most inviting thy clime;  Let the crimes of the East ne'er encrimson thy name,  Be freedom and science and virtue thy fame.  To conquest and slaughter let Europe aspire;  Whelm nations in blood, and wrap cities in fire;  Thy heroes the rights of mankind shall defend,  And triumph pursue them, and glory attend.  A world is thy realm; for a world be thy laws  Enlarged as thine empire, and just as thy cause;  On Freedom's broad basis that empire shall rise,  Extend with the main, and dissolve with the skies.  Fair Science her gates to thy sons shall unbar,  And the East see thy morn hide the beams of her star;  New bards and new sages unrivalled shall soar  To fame unextinguished when time is no more;  To thee, the last refuge of virtue designed,  Shall fly from all nations the best of mankind;  Here, grateful to Heaven, with transport shall bring  Their incense, more fragrant than odors of spring.  Nor less shall thy fair ones to glory ascend,  And genius and beauty in harmony blend;  The graces of form shall awake pure desire,  And the charms of the soul ever cherish the fire;  Their sweetness unmingled, their manners refined,  And virtue's bright image, enstamped on the mind,  With peace and soft rapture shall teach life to glow,  And light up a smile on the aspect of woe.  Thy fleets to all regions thy power shall display,  The nations admire, and the ocean obey;  Each shore to thy glory its tribute unfold,  And the East and the South yield their spices and gold.  As the dayspring unbounded thy splendor shall flow,  And earth's little kingdoms before thee shall bow,  While the ensigns of union, in triumph unfurled,  Hush the tumult of war, and give peace to the world.  Thus, as down a lone valley, with cedars o'er-spread,  From war's dread confusion, I pensively strayed,--  The gloom from the face of fair heaven retired;  The wind ceased to murmur, the thunders expired;  Perfumes, as of Eden, flowed sweetly along,  And a voice, as of angels, enchantingly sung:  "Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,  The queen of the world, and the child of the skies!"TIMOTHY DWIGHT.       *       *       *       *       *ON THE PROSPECT OF PLANTING ARTSAND LEARNING IN AMERICA.  The Muse, disgusted at an age and clime    Barren of every glorious theme,  In distant lands now waits a better time,    Producing subjects worthy fame.  In happy climes, where from the genial sun    And virgin earth such scenes ensue,  The force of art by nature seems outdone,    And fancied beauties by the true:  In happy climes, the seat of innocence,    Where nature guides and virtue rules,  Where men shall not impose for truth and sense    The pedantry of courts and schools:  There shall be sung another golden age,    The rise of empire and of arts,  The good and great inspiring epic rage,    The wisest heads and noblest hearts.  Not such as Europe breeds in her decay:    Such as she bred when fresh and young,  When heavenly flame did animate her clay,    By future poets shall be sung.  Westward the course of empire takes its way;    The first four acts already past,  A fifth shall close the drama with the day;    Time's noblest offspring is the last.BISHOP GEORGE BERKELEY.       *       *       *       *       *ENGLAND TO AMERICA.

The south-land boasts its teeming cane,  The prairied west its heavy grain,  And sunset's radiant gates unfold  On rising marts and sands of gold!  Rough, bleak, and hard, our little State  Is scant of soil, of limits strait;  Her yellow sands are sands alone,  Her only mines are ice and stone!  From autumn frost to April rain,  Too long her winter woods complain;  From budding flower to falling leaf,  Her summer time is all too brief.  Yet, on her rocks, and on her sands,  And wintry hills, the school-house stands;  And what her rugged soil denies  The harvest of the mind supplies.  The riches of the commonwealth  Are free, strong minds, and hearts of health;  And more to her than gold or grain  The cunning hand and cultured brain.  For well she keeps her ancient stock,  The stubborn strength of Pilgrim Rock;  And still maintains, with milder laws,  And clearer light, the good old cause!  Nor heeds the sceptic's puny hands,  While near her school the church-spire stands;  Nor fears the blinded bigot's rule,  While near her church-spire stands the school.JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.       *       *       *       *       *THE REPUBLIC.FROM "THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP."

Fear not each sudden sound and shock,  'Tis of the wave and not the rock;  'Tis but the flapping of the sail,  And not a rent made by the gale!  In spite of rock and tempest's roar,  In spite of false lights on the shore,  Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!

Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,    Where knelt the vanquished foe,  When winds were hurrying o'er the flood    And waves were white below,  No more shall feel the victor's tread,   Or know the conquered knee:  The harpies of the shore shall pluck    The eagle of the sea!  O better that her shattered hulk    Should sink beneath the wave!

Our country calls; away! away!    To where the blood-stream blots the green;  Strike to defend the gentlest sway    That Time in all his course has seen.  See, from a thousand coverts--see    Spring the armed foes that haunt her track;  They rush to smite her down, and we    Must beat the banded traitors back.  Ho! sturdy as the oaks ye cleave,    And moved as soon to fear and flight,  Men of the glade and forest! leave    Your woodcraft for the field of fight.  The arms that wield the axe must pour    An iron tempest on the foe;  His serried ranks shall reel before    The arm that lays the panther low.  And ye who breast the mountain storm    By grassy steep or highland lake,  Come, for the land ye love, to form    A bulwark that no foe can break.  Stand, like your own gray cliffs that mock    The whirlwind; stand in her defence:  The blast as soon shall move the rock,    As rushing squadrons bear ye thence.  And ye whose homes are by her grand    Swift rivers, rising far away,  Come from the depth of her green land    As mighty in your march as they;  As terrible as when the rains    Have swelled them over bank and bourne,  With sudden floods to drown the plains    And sweep along the woods uptorn.  And ye who throng beside the deep,    Her ports and hamlets of the strand,  In number like the waves that leap    On his long-murmuring marge of sand,  Come, like that deep, when, o'er his brim,    He rises, all his floods to pour,  And flings the proudest barks that swim,    A helpless wreck against his shore.  Few, few were they whose swords of old    Won the fair land in which we dwell;  But we are many, we who hold    The grim resolve to guard it well.  Strike for that broad and goodly land,    Blow after blow, till men shall see  That Might and Right move hand in hand,    And Glorious must their triumph be.WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.       *       *       *       *       *A CRY TO ARMS.[1861.]  Ho, woodsmen of the mountain-side!

Leave barn and byre, leave kin and cot,    Lay by the bloodless spade;  Let desk and case and counter rot,    And burn your books of trade!  The despot roves your fairest lands;    And till he flies or fears,  Your fields must grow but armed bands,    Your sheaves be sheaves of spears!  Give up to mildew and to rust    The useless tools of gain,  And feed your country's sacred dust    With floods of crimson rain!  Come with the weapons at your call--    With musket, pike, or knife;  He wields the deadliest blade of all    Who lightest holds his life.  The arm that drives its unbought blows    With all a patriot's scorn,  Might brain a tyrant with a rose    Or stab him with a thorn.  Does any falter? Let him turn    To some brave maiden's eyes,  And catch the holy fires that burn    In those sublunar skies.  Oh, could you like your women feel,    And in their spirit march,  A day might see your lines of steel    Beneath the victor's arch!  What hope, O God! would not grow warm    When thoughts like these give cheer?  The lily calmly braves the storm,    And shall the palm-tree fear?  No! rather let its branches court    The rack that sweeps the plain;  And from the lily's regal port    Learn how to breast the strain.  Ho, woodsmen of the mountain-side!    Ho, dwellers in the vales!  Ho, ye who by the roaring tide    Have roughened in the gales!

How little recks it where men lie,    When once the moment's past  In which the dim and glazing eye    Has looked on earth its last,--  Whether beneath the sculptured urn    The coffined form shall rest,  Or in its nakedness return    Back to its mother's, breast!  Death is a common friend or foe,    As different men may hold,  And at his summons each must go,    The timid and the bold;  But when the spirit, free and warm,    Deserts it, as it must,  What matter where the lifeless form    Dissolves again to dust?  The soldier falls 'mid corses piled  Upon the battle-plain,  Where reinless war-steeds gallop wild    Above the mangled slain;  But though his corse be grim to see,    Hoof-trampled on the sod,  What recks it, when the spirit free    Has soared aloft to God?  The coward's dying eyes may close    Upon his downy bed,  And softest hands his limbs compose,    Or garments o'er them spread.  But ye who shun the bloody fray,    When fall the mangled brave,  Go--strip his coffin-lid away,    And see him in his grave!  'Twere sweet, indeed, to close our eyes,    With those we cherish near,  And, wafted upwards by their sighs,    Soar to some calmer sphere.  But whether on the scaffold high,    Or in the battle's van,  The fittest place where man can die    Is where he dies for man!MICHAEL JOSEPH BARRY.       *       *       *       *       *LIBERTY.  What man is there so bold that he should say,  "Thus, and thus only, would I have the Sea"?  For whether lying calm and beautiful,  Clasping the earth in love, and throwing back  The smile of Heaven from waves of amethyst;  Or whether, freshened by the busy winds,  It bears the trade and navies of the world  To ends of use or stern activity;  Or whether, lashed by tempests, it gives way  To elemental fury, howls and roars  At all its rocky barriers, in wild lust  Of ruin drinks the blood of living things,  And strews its wrecks o'er leagues of desolate shore,--  Always it is the Sea, and men bow down  Before its vast and varied majesty.  So all in vain will timorous ones essay  To set the metes and bounds of Liberty.  For Freedom is its own eternal law:  It makes its own conditions, and in storm  Or calm alike fulfils the unerring Will.  Let us not then despise it when it lies  Still as a sleeping lion, while a swarm  Of gnat-like evils hover round its head;  Nor doubt it when in mad, disjointed times  It shakes the torch of terror, and its cry  Shrills o'er the quaking earth, and in the flame  Of riot and war we see its awful form  Rise by the scaffold, where the crimson axe  Rings down its grooves the knell of shuddering kings.  For ever in thine eyes, O Liberty,  Shines that high light whereby the world is saved,  And though thou slay us, we will trust in thee!JOHN HAY.       *       *       *       *       *PATIENCE.FROM "POEMS OF FREEDOM."  Be patient, O be patient! Put your ear against the earth;  Listen there how noiselessly the germ o' the seed has birth;  How noiselessly and gently it upheaves its little way  Till it parts the scarcely-broken ground, and the blade stands up in          the day.  Be patient, O be patient! the germs of mighty thought  Must have their silent undergrowth, must underground be wrought;  But, as sure as ever there's a Power that makes the grass appear,  Our land shall be green with Liberty, the blade-time shall be here.  Be patient, O be patient! go and watch the wheat-ears grow,  So imperceptibly that ye can mark nor change nor throe:  Day after day, day after day till the ear is fully grown;  And then again day after day, till the ripened field is brown.  Be patient, O be patient! though yet our hopes are green,  The harvest-field of Freedom shall be crowned with the sunny sheen.  Be ripening, be ripening! mature your silent way  Till the whole broad land is tongued with fire on Freedom's harvest          day.WILLIAM JAMES LINTON.       *       *       *       *       *THE ANTIQUITY OF FREEDOM.    Here are old trees, tail oaks and gnarled pines,  That stream with gray-green mosses; here the ground  Was never trenched by spade, and flowers spring up  Unsown, and die ungathered. It is sweet  To linger here, among the flitting birds,  And leaping squirrels, wandering brooks, and winds  That shake the leaves, and scatter, as they pass,  A fragrance from the cedars, thickly set  With pale blue berries. In these peaceful shades--  Peaceful, unpruned, immeasurably old--  My thoughts go up the long dim path of years,  Back to the earliest days of liberty.    Oh FREEDOM! thou art not, as poets dream,  A fair young girl, with light and delicate limbs,  And wavy tresses gushing from the cap  With which the Roman master crowned his slave  When he took off the gyves. A bearded man,  Armed to the teeth, art thou; one mailed hand  Grasps the broad shield, and one the sword; thy brow,  Glorious in beauty though it be, is scarred  With tokens of old wars; thy massive limbs  Are strong with struggling. Power at thee has launched  His bolts, and with his lightnings smitten thee;  They could not quench the life thou hast from heaven.  Merciless power has dug thy dungeon deep,  And his swart armorers, by a thousand fires,  Have forged thy chain; yet, while he deems thee bound,  The links are shivered, and the prison walls  Fall outward: terribly thou springest forth,  As springs the flame above a burning pile,  And shoutest to the nations, who return  Thy shoutings, while the pale oppressor flies.    Thy birthright was not given by human hands:  Thou wert twin-born with man. In pleasant fields,  While yet our race was few, thou sat'st with him,  To tend the quiet flock and watch the stars,  And teach the reed to utter simple airs.  Thou by his side, amid the tangled wood,  Didst war upon the panther and the wolf,  His only foes; and thou with him didst draw  The earliest furrows on the mountain side,  Soft with the deluge. Tyranny himself,  Thy enemy, although of reverend look,  Hoary with many years, and far obeyed,  Is later born than thou; and as he meets  The grave defiance of thine elder eye,  The usurper trembles in his fastnesses.    Thou shalt wax stronger with the lapse of years,  But he shall fade into a feebler age;  Feebler, yet subtler. He shall weave his snares,  And spring them on thy careless steps, and clap  His withered hands, and from their ambush call  His hordes to fall upon thee. He shall send  Quaint maskers, forms of fair and gallant mien,  To catch thy gaze, and uttering graceful words  To charm thy ear; while his sly imps, by stealth,  Twine around thee threads of steel, light thread on thread,  That grow to fetters; or bind down thy arms  With chains concealed in chaplets. Oh! not yet  May'st thou unbrace thy corselet, nor lay by  Thy sword; nor yet, O Freedom! close thy lids  In slumber; for thine enemy never sleeps,  And thou must watch and combat till the day  Of the new earth and heaven. But wouldst thou rest  Awhile from tumult and the frauds of men,  These old and friendly solitudes invite  Thy visit. They, while yet the forest trees  Were young upon the unviolated earth,  And yet the moss-stains on the rock were new,  Beheld thy glorious childhood, and rejoiced.WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.       *       *       *       *       *HALLOWED GROUND.  What's hallowed ground? Has earth a clod  Its Maker meant not should be trod  By man, the image of his God,    Erect and free,  Unscourged by Superstition's rod    To bow the knee?  That's hallowed ground where, mourned and missed,  The lips repose our love has kissed;--  But where's their memory's mansion? Is't    Yon churchyard's bowers?  No! in ourselves their souls exist,    A part of ours.  A kiss can consecrate the ground  Where mated hearts are mutual bound:  The spot where love's first links were wound,    That ne'er are riven,  Is hallowed down to earth's profound,    And up to heaven!  For time makes all but true love old;  The burning thoughts that then were told  Run molten still in memory's mould;    And will not cool  Until the heart itself be cold    In Lethe's pool.  What hallows ground where heroes sleep?  'Tis not the sculptured piles you heap!  In dews that heavens far distant weep      Their turf may bloom;  Or Genii twine beneath the deep      Their coral tomb.  But strew his ashes to the wind  Whose sword or voice has served mankind,--  And is he dead, whose glorious mind    Lifts thine on high?--  To live in hearts we leave behind    Is not to die.  Is't death to fall for Freedom's right?  He's dead alone that lacks her light!  And murder sullies in heaven's sight    The sword he draws:--  What can alone ennoble fight?    A noble cause!  Give that,--and welcome War to brace  Her drums, and rend heaven's reeking space!  The colors planted face to face,    The charging cheer,  Though Death's pale horse lead on the chase,    Shall still be dear.  And place our trophies where men kneel  To Heaven!--but Heaven rebukes my zeal!  The cause of Truth and human weal,    O God above!  Transfer it from the sword's appeal    To Peace and Love.  Peace, Love! the cherubim, that join  Their spread wings o'er Devotion's shrine,  Prayers sound in vain, and temples shine,    Where they are not,--  The heart alone can make divine    Religion's spot.  To incantations dost thou trust,  And pompous rites in domes august?  See mouldering stones and metal's rust    Belie the vaunt,  That man can bless one pile of dust    With chime or chant.  The ticking wood-worm mocks thee, man!  Thy temples,--creeds themselves grow wan!  But there's a dome of nobler span,    A temple given  Thy faith, that bigots dare not ban,--    Its space is heaven!  Its roof, star-pictured Nature's ceiling,  Where, trancing the rapt spirit's feeling,  And God himself to man revealing,    The harmonious spheres  Make music, though unheard their pealing    By mortal ears.  Fair stars! are not your beings pure?  Can sin, can death, your worlds obscure?  Else why so swell the thoughts at your    Aspect above?  Ye must be heavens that make us sure    Of heavenly love!  And in your harmony sublime  I read the doom of distant time;  That man's regenerate soul from crime    Shall yet be drawn,  And reason on his mortal clime    Immortal dawn.  What's hallowed ground? 'Tis what gives birth  To sacred thoughts in souls of worth!--  Peace! Independence! Truth! go forth    Earth's compass round;  And your high-priesthood shall make earth    _All hallowed ground_.THOMAS CAMPBELL.       *       *       *       *       *THE WOLF AND THE DOG.  A prowling wolf, whose shaggy skin  (So strict the watch of dogs had been)    Hid little but his bones,  Once met a mastiff dog astray.  A prouder, fatter, sleeker Tray    No human mortal owns.      Sir Wolf, in famished plight,    Would fain have made a ration    Upon his fat relation:      But then he first must fight;    And well the dog seemed able    To save from wolfish table      His carcass snug and tight.  So then in civil conversation  The wolf expressed his admiration  Of Tray's fine case. Said Tray politely,  "Yourself, good sir, may be as sightly;  Quit but the woods, advised by me:  For all your fellows here, I see,  Are shabby wretches, lean and gaunt,  Belike to die of haggard want.  With such a pack, of course it follows,  One fights for every bit he swallows.    Come then with me, and share  On equal terms our princely fare."      "But what with you      Has one to do?"  Inquires the wolf. "Light work indeed,"  Replies the dog: "you only need  To bark a little now and then,  To chase off duns and beggar-men,  To fawn on friends that come or go forth,  Your master please, and so forth;    For which you have to eat    All sorts of well-cooked meat--  Cold pullets, pigeons, savory messes--  Besides unnumbered fond caresses."    The wolf, by force of appetite,    Accepts the terms outright,    Tears glistened in his eyes;    But faring on, he spies  A galled spot on the mastiff's neck.  "What's that?" he cries. "Oh, nothing but a speck."  "A speck?"--"Ay, ay: 'tis not enough to pain me:  Perhaps the collar's mark by which they chain me."    "Chain! chain you! What! run you not, then,        Just where you please and when?"      "Not always, sir; but what of that?"      "Enough for me, to spoil your fat!      It ought to be a precious price      Which could to servile chains entice;      For me, I'll shun them while I've wit."      So ran Sir Wolf, and runneth yet.From the French of JEAN DE LA FONTAINE.Translation of ELIZUR WRIGHT.       *       *       *       *       *RIENZI TO THE ROMANS.FROM "RIENZI."                                     Friends!  I come not here to talk. Ye know too well  The story of our thraldom. We are slaves!  The bright sun rises to his course, and lights  A race of slaves! he sets, and his last beam  Falls on a slave! Not such as, swept along  By the full tide of power, the conqueror leads  To crimson glory and undying fame,  But base, ignoble slaves!--slaves to a horde  Of petty tyrants, feudal despots; lords  Rich in some dozen paltry villages,  Strong in some hundred spearmen, only great  In that strange spell,--a name! Each hour, dark fraud,  Or open rapine, or protected murder,  Cries out against them. But this very day  An honest man, my neighbor (_pointing to_ PAOLO),      --there he stands,--  Was struck--struck like a dog--by one who wore  The badge of Ursini! because, forsooth,  He tossed not high his ready cap in air,  Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,  At sight of that great ruffian! Be we men,  And suffer such dishonor? men, and wash not  The stain away in blood? Such shames are common.  I have known deeper wrongs. I, that speak to ye,  I had a brother once, a gracious boy,  Full of all gentleness, of calmest hope,  Of sweet and quiet joy; there was the look  Of Heaven upon his face which limners give  To the beloved disciple. How I loved  That gracious boy! younger by fifteen years,  Brother at once and son! He left my side;  A summer bloom on his fair cheeks, a smile  Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour  The pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw  The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried  For vengeance! Rouse ye, Romans! Rouse ye, slaves!  Have ye brave sons?--Look in the next fierce brawl  To see them die! Have ye fair daughters?--Look  To see them live, torn from your arms, distained.  Dishonored; and, if ye dare call for justice,  Be answered by the lash! Yet this is Rome,  That sat on her seven hills, and from her throne  Of beauty ruled the world! Yet we are Romans!  Why, in that elder day, to be a Roman  Was greater than a king! And once again--  Hear me, ye walls, that echoed to the tread  Of either Brutus!--once again, I swear,  The eternal city shall be free; her sons shall walk with princes.MARY RUSSELL MITFORD.       *       *       *       *       *FALLEN GREECE.FROM "THE GIAOUR."  Clime of the unforgotten brave!  Whose land, from plain to mountain-cave,  Was Freedom's home or Glory's grave!  Shrine of the mighty! can it be  That this is all remains of thee?  Approach, thou craven, crouching slave;    Say, is not this Thermopylae?  These waters blue that round you lave,    O servile offspring of the free,--  Pronounce what sea, what shore is this?  The gulf, the rock of Salamis!  These scenes, their story not unknown,  Arise, and make again your own;  Snatch from the ashes of your sires  The embers of their former fires;  And he who in the strife expires  Will add to theirs a name of fear  That Tyranny shall quake to hear,  And leave his sons a hope, a fame,  They too will rather die than shame;  For Freedom's battle once begun,  Bequeathed by bleeding sire to son,  Though baffled oft is ever won.  Hear witness, Greece, thy living page;  Attest it, many a deathless age:  While kings, in dusty darkness hid,  Have left a nameless pyramid,  Thy heroes, though the general doom  Hath swept the column from their tomb,  A mightier monument command,  The mountains of their native land!  There points thy Muse to stranger's eye  The graves of those that cannot die!  'Twere long to tell, and sad to trace,  Each step from splendor to disgrace:  Enough,--no foreign foe could quell  Thy soul, till from itself it fell;  Yes! self-abasement paved the way  To villain-bonds and despot sway.  What can he tell who treads thy shore?    No legend of thine olden time,  No theme on which the Muse might soar,  High as thine own in days of yore,    When man was worthy of thy clime.  The hearts within thy valleys bred,  The fiery souls that might have led    Thy sons to deeds sublime,  Now crawl from cradle to the grave,  Slaves--nay, the bondsmen of a slave,    And callous save to crime.LORD BYRON.       *       *       *       *       *GREECE ENSLAVED.FROM "CHILDE HAROLD" CANTO II.    Fair Greece! sad relic of departed worth!    Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great!    Who now shall lead thy scattered children forth,    And long-accustomed bondage uncreate?    Not such thy sons who whilom did await,    The hopeless warriors of a willing doom,    In bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait,--    O, who that gallant spirit shall resume,  Leap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?    Spirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow    Thou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,    Couldst thou forebode the dismal hour which now    Dims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?    Not thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,    But every earle can lord it o'er thy land;    Nor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,    Trembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,  From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.    In all save form alone, how changed! and who    That marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,    Who but would deem their bosoms burned anew    With thy unquenched beam, lost liberty!    And many dream withal the hour is nigh    That gives them back their fathers' heritage;    For foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,    Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage,  Or tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.    Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not,    Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?    By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?    Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye? No!    True, they may lay your proud despoilers low,    But not for you will Freedom's altars flame.    Shades of the Helots! triumph o'er your foe!    Greece! change thy lords, thy state is still the same;  Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thy years of shame!    And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,    Land of lost gods and godlike men, art thou!    Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,    Proclaim thee Nature's varied favorite now.    Thy fanes, thy temples to thy surface bow,    Commingling slowly with heroic earth.    Broke by the share of every rustic plough:    So perish monuments of mortal birth.  So perish all in turn, save well-recorded worth;    Save where some solitary column mourns    Above its prostrate brethren of the cave;    Save where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns    Colonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave;    Save o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,    Where the gray stones and long-neglected grass    Ages, but not oblivion, feebly brave,    While strangers only not regardless pass,  Lingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh      "Alas!"    Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild,    Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,    Thine olive ripe as when Minerva smiled,    And still his honeyed wealth Hymettus yields;    There the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,    The free-born wanderer of thy mountain air;    Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,    Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare:  Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.    Where'er we tread, 'tis haunted, holy ground;    No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,    But one vast realm of wonder spreads around,    And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,    Till the sense aches with gazing to behold    The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:    Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,    Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:  Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon.LORD BYRON.       *       *       *       *       *SONG OF THE GREEK POET.FROM "DON JUAN," CANTO III.  The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!    Where burning Sappho loved and sung,  Where grew the arts of war and peace,    Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!  Eternal summer gilds them yet;  But all, except their sun, is set.  The Scian and the Teian muse,    The hero's harp, the lover's lute,  Have found the fame your shores refuse;    Their place of birth alone is mute  To sounds which echo further west  Than your sires' Islands of the Blest.  The mountains look on Marathon,    And Marathon looks on the sea:  And musing there an hour alone,    I dreamed that Greece might still be free;  For, standing on the Persians' grave,  I could not deem myself a slave.  A king sat on the rocky brow    Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;  And ships, by thousands, lay below,    And men in nations--all were his!  He counted them at break of day--  And when the sun set, where were they?  And where are they? and where art thou,    My country? On thy voiceless shore  The heroic lay is tuneless now,    The heroic bosom beats no more!  And must thy lyre, so long divine,  Degenerate into hands like mine?  'Tis something in the dearth of fame,    Though linked among a fettered race,  To feel at least a patriot's shame,    Even as I sing, suffuse my face;  For what is left the poet here?  For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.  Must we but weep o'er days more blest?    Must we but blush? Our fathers bled.  Earth! render back from out thy breast    A remnant of our Spartan dead!  Of the three hundred grant but three,  To make a new Thermopylae!  What! silent still? and silent all?    Ah no!--the voices of the dead  Sound like a distant torrent's fall,    And answer, "Let one living head,  But one, arise--we come, we come!"  'Tis but the living who are dumb.  In vain,--in vain; strike other chords;    Fill high the cup with Samian wine!  Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,    And shed the blood of Scio's vine!  Hark! rising to the ignoble call,  How answers each bold Bacchanal!  You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,--    Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?  Of two such lessons, why forget    The nobler and the manlier one?  You have the letters Cadmus gave,--  Think ye he meant them for a slave?  Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!    We will not think of themes like these!  It made Anacreon's song divine:    He served, but served Polycrates,--  A tyrant; but our masters then  Were still, at least, our countrymen.  The tyrant of the Chersonese    Was freedom's best and bravest friend;  That tyrant was Miltiades!    O that the present hour would lend  Another despot of the kind!  Such chains as his were sure to bind.  Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!    On Suli's rock and Parga's shore  Exists the remnant of a line    Such as the Doric mothers bore;  And there perhaps some seed is sown  The Heracleidan blood might own.  Trust not for freedom to the Franks,--    They have a king who buys and sells:  In native swords, and native ranks,    The only hope of courage dwells;  But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,  Would break your shield, however broad.  Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!    Our virgins dance beneath the shade,--  see their glorious black eyes shine;    But, gazing on each glowing maid,  My own the burning tear-drop laves,  To think such breasts must suckle slaves.  Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,    Where nothing, save the waves and I,  May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;    There, swan-like, let me sing and die.  A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine,--  Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!LORD BYRON.       *       *       *       *       *TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON.  When Love with unconfined wings    Hovers within my gates,  And by divine Althea brings    To whisper at my grates;  When I lie tangled in her hair    And fettered with her eye,  The birds that wanton in the air    Know no such liberty.  When flowing cups pass swiftly round    With no allaying Thames,  Our careless heads with roses crowned,    Our hearts with loyal flames;  When thirsty grief in wine we steep,    When healths and draughts go free,  Fishes that tipple in the deep    Know no such liberty.  When, like committed linnets, I    With shriller throat shall sing  The mercy, sweetness, majesty    And glories of my King;  When I shall voice aloud, how good    He is, how great should be,  Enlarged winds that curl the flood    Know no such liberty.  Stone walls do not a prison make,    Nor iron bars a cage;  Minds innocent and quiet take    That for an hermitage:  If I have freedom in my love,    And in my soul am free,  Angels alone, that soar above,    Enjoy such liberty.RICHARD LOVELACE.       *       *       *       *       *SLAVERY.FROM "THE TIMEPIECE": "THE TASK," BK. II.    O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,  Some boundless contiguity of shade,  Where rumor of oppression and deceit,  Of unsuccessful or successful war,  Might never reach me more! My ear is pained,  My soul is sick, with every day's report  Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.  There is no flush in man's obdurate heart;  It does not feel for man; the natural bond  Of brotherhood is served as the flax,  That falls asunder at the touch of fire.  He finds his fellow guilty of a skin  Not colored like his own, and, having power  To enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause  Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.  Lands intersected by a narrow frith  Abhor each other. Mountains interposed  Make enemies of nations, who had else  Like kindred drops been mingled into one.  Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;  And, worse than all, and most to be deplored  As human nature's broadest, foulest blot,  Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat  With stripes, that Mercy, with a bleeding heart,  Weeps, when she sees inflicted on a beast.  Then what is man? And what man, seeing this,  And having human feelings, does not blush,  And hang his head, to think himself a man?  I would not have a slave to till my ground,  To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,  And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth  That sinews bought and sold have ever earned.  No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's  Just estimation prized above all price,  I had much rather be myself the slave,  And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.  We have no slaves at home.--Then why abroad?  And they themselves, once ferried o'er the wave  That parts us, are emancipate and loosed.  Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs  Receive our air, that moment they are free;  They touch our country, and their shackles fall.  That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud  And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,  And let it circulate through every vein  Of all your empire; that, where Britain's power  Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.WILLIAM COWPER.       *       *       *       *       *SONG OF THE WESTERN MEN.[After the English Revolution of 1688, all bishops were compelled toswear allegiance to William and Mary.

The harp that once through Tara's halls    The soul of music shed,  Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls    As if that soul were fled.  So sleeps the pride of former days,    So glory's thrill is o'er,  And hearts that once beat high for praise    Now feel that pulse no more!  No more to chiefs and ladies bright    The harp of Tara swells;  The chord alone that breaks at night    Its tale of ruin tells.  Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes,    The only throb she gives  Is when some heart indignant breaks,    To show that still she lives.THOMAS MOORE.       *       *       *       *       *AS BY THE SHORE AT BREAK OF DAY.

And still outrings her freedom-song,    Amid the glaciers sparkling there,  At Sabbath bell, as peasants throng  Their mountain fastnesses along,    Happy, and free as air.  The hills were made for freedom; they    Break at a breath the tyrant's rod;  Chains clank in valleys; there the prey  Writhes 'neath Oppression's heel alway:    Hills bow to none but God!WILLIAM GOLDSMITH BROWN.       *       *       *       *       *SWITZERLAND.FROM "WILLIAM TELL."    Once Switzerland was free! With what a pride  I used to walk these hills,--look up to heaven,  And bless God that it was so! It was free  From end to end, from cliff to lake 'twas free!  Free as our torrents are, that leap our rocks,  And plough our valleys, without asking leave;  Or as our peaks, that wear their caps of snow  In very presence of the regal sun!  How happy was I in it then! I loved  Its very storms. Ay, often have I sat  In my boat at night, when, midway o'er the lake,  The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge  The wind came roaring,--I have sat and eyed  The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled  To see him shake his lightnings o'er my head,  And think--I had no master save his own!JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES.       *       *       *       *       *MAKE WAY FOR LIBERTY![Battle of Sempach, fourteenth century.]    "Make way for Liberty!"--he cried;  Made way for Liberty, and died!    In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,  A living wall, a human wood!  A wall, where every conscious stone  Seemed to its kindred thousands grown;  A rampart all assaults to bear,  Till time to dust their frames should wear;  A wood like that enchanted grove  In which with fiends Rinaldo strove,  Where every silent tree possessed  A spirit prisoned in its breast,  Which the first stroke of coming strife  Would startle into hideous life:  So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,  A living wall, a human wood!  Impregnable their front appears,  All horrent with projected spears,  Whose polished points before them shine,  From flank to flank, one brilliant line,  Bright as the breakers' splendors run  Along the billows to the sun.    Opposed to these, a hovering band  Contended for their native land:  Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke  From manly necks the ignoble yoke,  And forged their fetters into swords,  On equal terms to fight their lords,  And what insurgent rage had gained  In many a mortal fray maintained:  Marshalled once more at Freedom's call,  They came to conquer or to fall,  Where he who conquered, he who fell,  Was deemed a dead, or living, Tell!  Such virtues had that patriot breathed,  So to the soil his soul bequeathed,  That wheresoe'er his arrows flew  Heroes in his own likeness grew,  And warriors sprang from every sod  Which his awakening footstep trod.    And now the work of life and death  Hung on the passing of a breath;  The fire of conflict burned within,  The battle trembled to begin:  Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,  Point for attack was nowhere found;  Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,  The unbroken line of lances blazed:  That line 'twere suicide to meet,  And perish at their tyrants' feet,--  How could they rest within their graves,  And leave their homes the homes of slaves?  Would they not feel their children tread  With clanging chains above their head?    It must not be: this day, this hour,  Annihilates the oppressor's power;  All Switzerland is in the field,  She will not fly, she cannot yield,--  She must not fall; her better fate  Here gives her an immortal date.  Few were the numbers she could boast;  But every freeman was a host,  And felt as though himself were he  On whose sole arm hung victory.    It did depend on _one_ indeed;  Behold him,--Arnold Winkelried!  There sounds not to the trump of fame  The echo of a nobler name.  Unmarked he stood amid the throng,  In rumination deep and long,  Till you might see, with sudden grace,  The very thought come o'er his face,  And by the motion of his form  Anticipate the bursting storm,  And by the uplifting of his brow  Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.    But ' twas no sooner thought than done,  The field was in a moment won:--    "Make way for Liberty!" he cried,  Then ran, with arms extended wide,  As if his dearest friend to clasp;  Ten spears he swept within his grasp.    "Make way for Liberty!" he cried;  Their keen points met from side to side;  He bowed amongst them like a tree,  And thus made way for Liberty.    Swift to the breach his comrades fly;  "Make way for Liberty!" they cry,  And through the Austrian phalanx dart,  As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart;  While, instantaneous as his fall,  Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all:  An earthquake could not overthrow  A city with a surer blow.    Thus Switzerland again was free;  Thus Death made way for Liberty!JAMES MONTGOMERY.       *       *       *       *       *POLAND.FROM "THE PLEASURES OF HOPE," PART I.  O sacred Truth! thy triumph ceased awhile,  And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,  When leagued Oppression poured to Northern wars  Her whiskered pandours and her fierce hussars,  Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,  Pealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet horn;  Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,  Presaging wrath to Poland--and to man!    Warsaw's last champion from her height surveyed,  Wide o'er the fields, a waste of ruin laid;  "O Heaven!" he cried, "my bleeding country save!--  Is there no hand on high to shield the brave?  Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains,  Rise, fellow-men! our country yet remains!  By that dread name, we wave the sword on high,  And swear for her to live--with her to die!"    He said, and on the rampart-heights arrayed  His trusty warriors, few, but undismayed;  Firm-paced and slow, a horrid front they form,  Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;  Low murmuring sounds along their banners fly,  Revenge, or death,--the watchword and reply;  Then pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,  And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm!--    In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!  From rank to rank your volleyed thunder flew:--  O, bloodiest picture in the book of Time!  Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;  Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,  Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe!  Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,  Closed her bright eye, and curbed her high career;  Hope, for a season, bade the world farewell,  And Freedom shrieked--as Kosciusko fell!THOMAS CAMPBELL.       *       *       *       *       *THE MARSEILLAISE.  Ye sons of freedom, wake to glory!    Hark! hark! what myriads bid you rise!  Your children, wives, and grandsires hoary,    Behold their tears and hear their cries!

To arms! to arms! ye brave!        The avenging sword unsheathe;      March on! march on! all hearts resolved        On victory or death.  Now, now the dangerous storm is rolling,    Which treacherous kings confederate raise;  The dogs of war, let loose, are howling,    And lo! our fields and cities blaze;  And shall we basely view the ruin,      While lawless force, with guilty stride,      Spreads desolation far and wide,  With crimes and blood his hands imbruing?        To arms! to arms! ye brave, etc.  O Liberty! can man resign thee,    Once having felt thy generous flame?  Can dungeons, bolts, or bars confine thee?    Or whips thy noble spirit tame?  Too long the world has wept, bewailing      That falsehood's dagger tyrants wield,      But freedom is our sword and shield,  And all their arts are unavailing.        To arms! to arms! ye brave, etc.From the French of CLAUDE JOSEPH ROUGET DE LISLE.       *       *       *       *       *A COURT LADY.  Her hair was tawny with gold, her eyes with purple were dark,  Her cheeks' pale opal burnt with a red and restless spark.  Never was lady of Milan nobler in name and in race;  Never was lady of Italy fairer to see in the face.  Never was lady on earth more true as woman and wife,  Larger in judgment and instinct, prouder in manners and life.  She stood in the early morning, and said to her maidens, "Bring  That silken robe made ready to wear at the court of the king.  "Bring me the clasps of diamonds, lucid, clear of the mote,  Clasp me the large at the waist, and clasp me the small at the throat.  "Diamonds to fasten the hair, and diamonds to fasten the sleeves,  Laces to drop from their rays, like a powder of snow from the eaves."  Gorgeous she entered the sunlight which gathered her up in a flame,  While straight, in her open carriage, she to the hospital came.  In she went at the door, and gazing, from end to end,  "Many and low are the pallets, but each is the place of a friend."  Up she passed through the wards, and stood at a young man's bed:  Bloody the band on his brow, and livid the droop of his head.  "Art thou a Lombard, my brother? Happy art thou!" she cried,  And smiled like Italy on him: he dreamed in her face and died.  Pale with his passing soul, she went on still to a second:  _He_ was a grave, hard man, whose years by dungeons were reckoned.  Wounds in his body were sore, wounds in his life were sorer.  "Art thou a Romagnole?" Her eyes drove lightnings before her.  "Austrian and priest had joined to double and tighten the cord  Able to bind thee, O strong one,--free by the stroke of a sword.  "Now be grave for the rest of us, using the life overcast  To ripen our wine of the present (too new) in glooms of the past."  Down she stepped to a pallet where lay a face like a girl's,  Young, pathetic with dying,--a deep black hole in the curls.  "Art thou from Tuscany, brother? and seest thou, dreaming in pain,  Thy mother stand in the piazza, searching the list of the slain?"  Kind as a mother herself, she touched his cheeks with her hands:  "Blessed is she who has borne thee, although she should weep as she          stands."  On she passed to a Frenchman, his arm carried off by a ball:  Kneeling,... "O more than my brother! how shall I thank thee for all?  "Each of the heroes round us has fought for his land and line,  But _thou_ hast fought for a stranger, in hate of a wrong not thine.  "Happy are all free peoples, too strong to be dispossessed;  But blessed are those among nations who dare to be strong for the          rest!"  Ever she passed on her way, and came to a couch where pined  One with a face from Venetia, white with a hope out of mind.  Long she stood and gazed, and twice she tried at the name,  But two great crystal tears were all that faltered and came.  Only a tear for Venice?--she turned as in passion and loss,  And stooped to his forehead and kissed it, as if she were kissing          the cross.  Faint with that strain of heart, she moved on then to another,  Stern and strong in his death. "And dost thou suffer, my brother?"  Holding his hands in hers:--"Out of the Piedmont lion  Cometh the sweetness of freedom! sweetest to live or to die on."  Holding his cold, rough hands,--"Well, O, well have ye done  In noble, noble Piedmont, who would not be noble alone."  Back he fell while she spoke. She rose to her feet with a spring,--  "That was a Piedmontese! and this is the Court of the King."ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.       *       *       *       *       *THE LANDING OF THE PILGRIMFATHERS IN NEW ENGLAND.  The breaking waves dashed high    On a stern and rock-bound coast,  And the woods against a stormy sky    Their giant branches tossed;  And the heavy night hung dark    The hills and waters o'er,  When a band of exiles moored their bark    On the wild New England shore.  Not as the conqueror comes,    They, the true-hearted, came;  Not with the roll of the stirring drums,    And the trumpet that sings of fame:  Not as the flying come,    In silence and in fear;--  They shook the depths of the desert gloom    With their hymns of lofty cheer.  Amidst the storm they sang,    And the stars heard, and the sea;  And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang    To the anthem of the free.  The ocean eagle soared    From his nest by the white wave's foam,  And the rocking pines of the forest roared,--    This was their welcome home.  There were men with hoary hair    Amidst that pilgrim-band:  Why had they come to wither there,    Away from their childhood's land?  There was woman's fearless eye,    Lit by her deep love's truth;  There was manhood's brow serenely high,    And the fiery heart of youth.  What sought they thus afar?    Bright jewels of the mine?  The wealth of the seas, the spoils of war?--    They sought a faith's pure shrine!  Ay, call it holy ground,    The soil where first they trod;  They have left unstained what there they found,--    Freedom to worship God.FELICIA HEMANS.       *       *       *       *       *THE AMERICAN FLAG.  When Freedom, from her mountain height,    Unfurled her standard to the air,  She tore the azure robe of night,    And set the stars of glory there!  She mingled with its gorgeous dyes  The milky baldric of the skies,  And striped its pure, celestial white  With streakings of the morning light;  Then, from his mansion in the sun,  She called her eagle-bearer down,  And gave into his mighty hand  The symbol of her chosen land!  Majestic monarch of the cloud!    Who rear'st aloft thy regal form,  To hear the tempest trumping loud,  And see the lightning lances driven,    When strive the warriors of the storm,  And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven,--  Child of the Sun! to thee 'tis given    To guard the banner of the free,  To hover in the sulphur smoke,  To ward away the battle-stroke,  And bid its blendings shine afar,  Like rainbows on the cloud of war,    The harbingers of victory!  Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,  The sign of hope and triumph high!  When speaks the signal-trumpet tone,  And the long line comes gleaming on,  Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,  Has dimmed the glistening bayonet,  Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn  To where thy sky-born glories burn,  And, as his springing steps advance,  Catch war and vengeance from the glance.  And when the cannon-mouthings loud  Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,  And gory sabres rise and fall  Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall,  Then shall thy meteor glances glow,    And cowering foes shall shrink beneath  Each gallant arm that strikes below    That lovely messenger of death.  Flag of the seas! on ocean wave  Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave;  When death, careering on the gale,  Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,  And frighted waves rush wildly back  Before the broadside's reeling rack,  Each dying wanderer of the sea  Shall look at once to heaven and thee,  And smile to see thy splendors fly  In triumph o'er his closing eye.  Flag of the free heart's hope and home,    By angel hands to valor given!  Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,    And all thy hues were born in heaven.  Forever float that standard sheet!  Where breathes the foe but falls before us,  With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,    And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us!JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE.       *       *       *       *       *THE STAR-BANGLED BANNER.[A][Footnote A: Begun during the attack on Fort McHenry, by a Britishfleet, which on the night of Sept. 13, 1814, unsuccessfully bombardedthat fort from the river Chesapeake; the author, an envoy from thecity of Baltimore, having been detained as a prisoner on the fleet.]  O, say, can you see by the dawn's early light  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?--  Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the clouds of the fight  O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming!  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;  O! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?  On that shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,  Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,  What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,  As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?  Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,  In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;  'Tis the star-spangled banner! O, long may it wave  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!  And where is that band who so vauntingly swore  That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion  A home and a country should leave us no more?  Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.  No refuge could save the hireling and slave  From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave;  And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!  O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand  Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!  Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heaven-rescued land  Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.  Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  And this be our motto. "_In God is our trust_:"  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.FRANCIS SCOTT KEY.       *       *       *       *       *NEW ENGLAND'S DEAD.  New England's dead! New England's dead!    On every hill they lie;  On every field of strife, made red    By bloody victory.  Each valley, where the battle poured    Its red and awful tide,  Beheld the brave New England sword    With slaughter deeply dyed.  Their bones are on the northern hill,    And on the southern plain,  By brook and river, lake and rill,    And by the roaring main.  The land is holy where they fought,    And holy where they fell;  For by their blood that land was bought,    The land they loved so well,  Then glory to that valiant band,  The honored saviours of the land!  O, few and weak their numbers were,--    A handful of brave men;  But to their God they gave their prayer,    And rushed to battle then.  The God of battles heard their cry,  And sent to them the victory.  They left the ploughshare in the mold,  Their flocks and herds without a fold,  The sickle in the unshorn grain,  The corn, half-garnered, on the plain,  And mustered, in their simple dress,  For wrongs to seek a stern redress,  To right those wrongs, come weal, come woe,  To perish, or o'ercome their foe.  And where are ye, O fearless men?    And where are ye to-day?  I call:--the hills reply again    That ye have passed away;  That on old Bunker's lonely height,    In Trenton, and in Monmouth ground,  The grass grows green, the harvest bright    Above each soldier's mound.  The bugle's wild and warlike blast    Shall muster them no more;  An army now might thunder past,    And they heed not its roar.  The starry flag, 'neath which they fought    In many a bloody day,  From their old graves shall rouse them not,    For they have passed away.ISAAC M'LELLAN.       *       *       *       *       *THE REFORMER.  All grim and soiled and brown and tan,    I saw a Strong One, in his wrath,  Smiting the godless shrines of man          Along his path.  The Church beneath her trembling dome    Essayed in vain her ghostly charm:  Wealth shook within his gilded home          With strange alarm.  Fraud from his secret chambers fled    Before the sunlight bursting in:  Sloth drew her pillow o'er her head          To drown the din.  "Spare," Art implored, "yon holy pile;    That grand old time-worn turret spare:"  Meek Reverence, kneeling in the aisle          Cried out, "Forbear!"  Gray-bearded Use, who, deaf and blind,    Groped for his old accustomed stone,  Leaned on his staff, and wept to find          His seat o'erthrown.  Young Romance raised his dreamy eyes,    O'erhung with paly locks of gold,--  "Why smite," he asked in sad surprise,          "The fair, the old?"  Yet louder rang the Strong One's stroke,    Yet nearer flashed his axe's gleam;  Shuddering and sick of heart I woke,          As from a dream.  I looked: aside the dust-cloud rolled,--    The Waster seemed the Builder too;  Upspringing from the ruined Old          I saw the New.  'Twas but the ruin of the bad,--    The wasting of the wrong and ill;  Whate'er of good the old time had          Was living still.  Calm grew the brows of him I feared,    The frown which awed me passed away,  And left behind a smile which cheered          Like breaking day.  The grain grew green on battle-plains,    O'er swarded war-mounds grazed the cow;  The slave stood forging from his chains          The spade and plough.  Where frowned the fort, pavilions gay    And cottage windows, flower-entwined,  Looked out upon the peaceful bay          And hills behind.  Through vine-wreathed cups with wine once red.    The lights on brimming crystal fell,  Drawn, sparkling, from the rivulet head          And mossy well.  Through prison-walls, like Heaven-sent hope,    Fresh breezes blew, and sunbeams strayed,  And with the idle gallows-rope          The young child played.  Where the doomed victim in his cell    Had counted o'er the weary hours,  Glad school-girls, answering to the bell,          Came crowned with flowers.  Grown wiser for the lesson given,    I fear no longer, for I know  That where the share is deepest driven          The best fruits grow.  The outworn rite, the old abuse,    The pious fraud transparent grown,  The good held captive in the use          Of wrong alone,--  These wait their doom, from that great law    Which makes the past time serve to-day;  And fresher life the world shall draw          From their decay.  O backward-looking son of time!    The new is old, the old is new,  The cycle of a change sublime          Still sweeping through.  So wisely taught the Indian seer;    Destroying Seva, forming Brahm,  Who wake by turn Earth's love and fear,          Are one, the same.  Idly as thou, in that old day    Thou mournest, did thy sire repine;  So, in his time, thy child grown gray          Shall sigh for thine.  But life shall on and upward go;    The eternal step of Progress beats  To that great anthem, calm and slow,          Which God repeats.  Take heart!--the Waster builds again,--    A charmed life old Goodness hath;  The tares may perish,--but the grain          Is not for death.  God works in all things; all obey    His first propulsion from the night:  Wake thou and watch!--the world is gray          With morning light!JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.       *       *       *       *       *FREEDOM OF THE MIND.WRITTEN WHILE IN PRISON FOR DENOUNCING THE DOMESTIC SLAVE-TRADE.  High walls and huge the body may confine,    And iron gates obstruct the prisoner's gaze,  And massive bolts may baffle his design,    And vigilant keepers watch his devious ways;  But scorns the immortal mind such base control:    No chains can bind it and no cell enclose.  Swifter than light it flies from pole to pole,    And in a flash from earth to heaven it goes.  It leaps from mount to mount; from vale to vale    It wanders, plucking honeyed fruits and flowers;  It visits home to hear the fireside tale    And in sweet converse pass the joyous hours;  'Tis up before the sun, roaming afar,  And in its watches wearies every star.WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.       *       *       *       *       *THE PRESENT CRISIS.  When a deed is done for Freedom, through the broad earth's aching          breast  Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on from east to west,  And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels the soul within him climb  To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy sublime  Of a century bursts full-blossomed on the thorny stem of Time.  Through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous throe,  When the travail of the Ages wrings earth's systems to and fro;  At the birth of each new Era, with a recognizing start,  Nation wildly looks at nation, standing with mute lips apart.  And glad Truth's yet mightier man-child leaps beneath the Future's          heart.  So the Evil's triumph sendeth, with a terror and a chill,  Under continent to continent, the sense of coming ill,  And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels his sympathies with God  In hot tear-drops ebbing earthward, to be drunk up by the sod,  Till a corpse crawls round unburied, delving in the nobler clod.  For mankind are one in spirit, and an instinct bears along,  Round the earth's electric circle, the swift flush of right or          wrong;  Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity's vast frame  Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush of joy or shame;--  In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal claim.  Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,  In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;  Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or          blight,  Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right,  And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.  Hast thou chosen, O my people, on whose party thou shalt stand,  Ere the Doom from its worn sandals shakes the dust against our land?  Though the cause of Evil prosper, yet 'tis Truth alone is strong,  And, albeit she wander outcast now, I see around her throng  Troops of beautiful, tall angels, to enshield her from all wrong.  Backward look across the ages and the beacon-moments see,  That, like peaks of some sunk continent, jut through Oblivion's sea;  Not an ear in court or market for the low foreboding cry  Of those Crises, God's stern winnowers, from whose feet earth's          chaff must fly;  Never shows the choice momentous till the judgment hath passed by.  Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record  One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;  Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,--  Yet that scaffold sways the Future, and, behind the dim unknown,  Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.  We see dimly in the Present what is small and what is great,  Slow of faith, how weak an arm may turn the iron helm of fate,  But the soul is still oracular; amid the market's din,  List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within,--  "They enslave their children's children who make compromise with          sin."  Slavery, the earthborn Cyclops, fellest of the giant brood,  Sons of brutish Force and Darkness, who have drenched the earth           with blood,  Famished in his self-made desert, blinded by our purer day,  Gropes in yet unblasted regions for his miserable prey;--  Shall we guide his gory fingers where our helpless children play?  Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched crust,  Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 'tis prosperous to be just;  Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,  Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified,  And the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.  Count me o'er earth's chosen heroes,--they were souls that stood          alone,  While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone,  Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline  To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,  By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design.  By the light of burning heretics Christ's bleeding feet I track,  Toiling up new Calvaries ever with the cross that turns not back,  And these mounts of anguish number how each generation learned  One new word of that grand _Credo_ which in prophet-hearts hath          burned  Since the first man stood God-conquered with his face to heaven          upturned.  For Humanity sweeps onward: where to-day the martyr stands,  On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands;  Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling fagots burn,  While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return  To glean up the scattered ashes into History's golden urn.  'Tis as easy to be heroes as to sit the idle slaves  Of a legendary virtue carved upon our fathers' graves,  Worshippers of light ancestral make the present light a crime;--  Was the Mayflower launched by cowards, steered by men behind their          time?  Turn those tracks toward Past or Future, that make Plymouth rock          sublime?  They were men of present valor, stalwart old iconoclasts,  Unconvinced by axe or gibbet that all virtue was the Past's;  But we make their truth our falsehood, thinking that hath made us          free,  Hoarding it in mouldy parchments, while our tender spirits flee  The rude grasp of that Impulse which drove them across the sea.  They have rights who dare maintain them; we are traitors to our          sires,  Smothering in their holy ashes Freedom's new-lit altar-fires;  Shall we make their creed our jailer? Shall we, in our haste to          slay,  From the tombs of the old prophets steal the funeral lamps away  To light up the martyr-fagots round the prophets of to-day?  New occasions teach new duties; Time makes ancient good uncouth;  They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of Truth;  Lo, before us gleam her camp-fires! we ourselves must Pilgrims be,  Launch our Mayflower, and steer boldly through the desperate winter          sea,  Nor attempt the Future's portal with the Past's blood-rusted key._December_, 1845.JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.       *       *       *       *       *THE LITTLE CLOUD.[A][Footnote A: Arousing of Anti-Slavery agitation, when it was proposedin Congress to abolish the "Missouri Compromise" and throw open theTerritories to slavery if their people should so vote.][1853.]  As when, on Carmel's sterile steep,    The ancient prophet bowed the knee,  And seven times sent his servant forth    To look toward the distant sea;  There came at last a little cloud,    Scarce larger than the human hand,  Spreading and swelling till it broke    In showers on all the herbless land;  And hearts were glad, and shouts went up,    And praise to Israel's mighty God,  As the sear hills grew bright with flowers,    And verdure clothed the valley sod,--  Even so our eyes have waited long;    But now a little cloud appears,  Spreading and swelling as it glides    Onward into the coming years.  Bright cloud of Liberty! full soon,    Far stretching from the ocean strand,  Thy glorious folds shall spread abroad,    Encircling our beloved land.  Like the sweet rain on Judah's hills,    The glorious boon of love shall fall,  And our bond millions shall arise,    As at an angel's trumpet-call.  Then shall a shout of joy go up,--    The wild, glad cry of freedom come  From hearts long crushed by cruel hands,    And songs from lips long sealed and dumb;  And every bondman's chain be broke,    And every soul that moves abroad  In this wide realm shall know and feel    The blessed Liberty of God.JOHN HOWARD BRYANT.       *       *       *       *       *BROWN OF OSSAWATOMIE.  John Brown of Ossawatomie spake on his dying day:  "I will not have to shrive my soul a priest in Slavery's pay;  But let some poor slave-mother whom I have striven to free,  With her children, from the gallows-stair put up a prayer for me!"  John Brown of Ossawatomie, they led him out to die;  And lo! a poor slave-mother with her little child pressed nigh:  Then the bold, blue eye grew tender, and the old harsh face grew          mild,  As he stooped between the jeering ranks and kissed the negro's          child!  The shadows of his stormy life that moment fell apart,  And they who blamed the bloody hand forgave the loving heart;  That kiss from all its guilty means redeemed the good intent,  And round the grisly fighter's hair the martyr's aureole bent!  Perish with him the folly that seeks through evil good!  Long live the generous purpose unstained with human blood!  Not the raid of midnight terror, but the thought which underlies;  Not the borderer's pride of daring, but the Christian's sacrifice.  Nevermore may yon Blue Ridges the Northern rifle hear,  Nor see the light of blazing homes flash on the negro's spear;  But let the free-winged angel Truth their guarded passes scale,  To teach that right is more than might, and justice more than mail!  So vainly shall Virginia set her battle in array;  In vain her trampling squadrons knead the winter snow with clay!  She may strike the pouncing eagle, but she dares not harm the dove;  And every gate she bars to Hate shall open wide to Love!JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.       *       *       *       *       *WORDS FOR THE "HALLELUJAH CHORUS."

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:  He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are          stored;  He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:       His truth is marching on.  I have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;  They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps;  I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:       His day is marching on.  I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel:  "As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;  Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,       Since God is marching on."  He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;  He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment-seat:  O, be swift, my soul, to answer him! be jubilant, my feet!       Our God is marching on.  In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,  With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;  As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,       While God is marching on.JULIA WARD HOWE.       *       *       *       *       *JOHN CHARLES FREMONT.[A][Footnote A: Fremont's proclamation of martial law in Missouri, inAugust, 1861, declaring free all slaves of Rebels, was received withardor by the North, but annulled by President Lincoln as premature.]  Thy error, Fremont, simply was to act  A brave man's part, without the statesman's tact,  And, taking counsel but of common sense,  To strike at cause as well as consequence.  O, never yet since Roland wound his horn  At Roncesvalles has a blast been blown  Far-heard, wide-echoed, startling as thine own,  Heard from the van of freedom's hope forlorn!  It had been safer, doubtless, for the time,  To flatter treason, and avoid offence  To that Dark Power whose underlying crime  Heaves upward its perpetual turbulence.  But, if thine be the fate of all who break  The ground for truth's seed, or forerun their years  Till lost in distance, or with stout hearts make  A lane for freedom through the level spears,  Still take thou courage! God has spoken through thee,  Irrevocable, the mighty words, Be free!  The land shakes with them, and the slave's dull ear  Turns from the rice-swamp stealthily to hear.  Who would recall them now must first arrest  The winds that blow down from the free North-west,  Ruffling the Gulf; or like a scroll roll back  The Mississippi to its upper springs.  Such words fulfil their prophecy, and lack  But the full time to harden into things.JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.       *       *       *       *       *HEROES.  The winds that once the Argo bore    Have died by Neptune's ruined shrines,  And her hull is the drift of the deep-sea floor,    Though shaped of Pelion's tallest pines.  You may seek her crew on every isle    Fair in the foam of AEgean seas,  But out of their rest no charm can wile    Jason and Orpheus and Hercules.  And Priam's wail is heard no more    By windy Ilion's sea-built walls;  Nor great Achilles, stained with gore,    Shouts "O ye gods, 'tis Hector falls!"  On Ida's mount is the shining snow,    But Jove has gone from its brow away;  And red on the plain the poppies grow    Where the Greek and the Trojan fought that day.  Mother Earth, are the heroes dead?    Do they thrill the soul of the years no more?  Are the gleaming snows and the poppies red    All that is left of the brave of yore?  Are there none to fight as Theseus fought,    Far in the young world's misty dawn?  Or teach as gray-haired Nestor taught?    Mother Earth, are the heroes gone?  Gone? In a grander form they rise.    Dead? We may clasp their hands in ours,  And catch the light of their clearer eyes,    And wreathe their brows with immortal flowers.  Wherever a noble deed is done,    'Tis the pulse of a hero's heart is stirred;  Wherever Right has a triumph won,    There are the heroes' voices heard.  Their armor rings on a fairer field    Than the Greek and the Trojan fiercely trod;  For Freedom's sword is the blade they wield,    And the gleam above is the smile of God.  So, in his isle of calm delight,    Jason may sleep the years away;  For the heroes live, and the sky is bright,    And the world is a braver world to-day.EDNA DEAN PROCTOR.       *       *       *       *       *LAUS DEO![On hearing the bells ring on the passage of the ConstitutionalAmendment abolishing slavery.]        It is done!

Loud and long    Lift the old exulting song;  Sing with Miriam by the sea:    He has cast the mighty down;    Horse and rider sink and drown;  He has triumphed gloriously!

Now went forth the morn,  Such as in highest heaven, arrayed in gold  Empyreal; from before her vanished night,  Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain  Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,  Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,  Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view.       *       *       *       *       *  The apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,  Idol of majesty divine, enclosed  With flaming cherubim, and golden shields;  Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now  'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left,  A dreadful interval, and front to front  Presented stood in terrible array  Of hideous length: before the cloudy van,  On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,  Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,  Came towering, armed in adamant and gold.THE CONFLICT.                    Michael bid sound  The archangel trumpet; through the vast of heaven  It sounded, and the faithful armies rung  Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze  The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined  The horrid shock. Now storming fury rose,  And clamor, such as heard in heaven till now  Was never; arms on armor clashing brayed  Horrible discord, and the madding wheels  Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise  Of conflict; overhead the dismal hiss  Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,  And flying vaulted either host with fire.  So under fiery cope together rushed  Both battles main, with ruinous assault  And inextinguishable rage. All heaven  Resounded; and had earth been then, all earth  Had to her centre shook.       *       *       *       *       *                      Deeds of eternal fame  Were done, but infinite: for wide was spread  That war, and various: sometimes on firm ground  A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,  Tormented all the air; all air seemed then  Conflicting fire.       *       *       *       *       *  Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power  Which God hath in his mighty angels placed!)  Their arms away threw, and to the hills  (For earth hath this variety from heaven,  Of pleasures situate in hill and dale),  Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew,  From their foundations loosening to and fro,  They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,  Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops  Uplifting bore them in their hands: amaze,  Be sure, and terror, seized the rebel host,  When coming towards them so dread they saw  The bottom of the mountains upward turned,   .      .      .      .  and on their heads  Main promontories flung, which in the air  Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;  Their armor helped their harm, crushed in and bruised  Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain  Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;  Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind  Out of such prison, though spirits of purest light,  Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.  The rest, in imitation, to like arms  Betook them, and the neighboring hills uptore:  So hills amid the air encountered hills,  Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire,  That underground they fought in dismal shade;  Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game  To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped  Upon confusion rose.THE VICTOR.  So spake the Son, and into terror changed  His countenance too severe to be beheld,  And full of wrath bent on his enemies.  At once the four spread out their starry wings  With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs  Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound  Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.  He on his impious foes right onward drove,  Gloomy as night: under his burning wheels  The steadfast empyrean shook throughout.  All but the throne itself of God. Full soon  Among them he arrived; in his right hand  Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent  Before him, such as in their souls infixed  Plagues: they, astonished, all resistance lost,  All courage; down their idle weapons dropt;  O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode  Of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate,  That wished the mountains now might be again  Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.  Nor less on either side tempestuous fell  His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four  Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;  One spirit in them ruled; and every eye  Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire  Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,  And of their wonted vigor left them drained,  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked  His thunder in mid volley; for he meant  Not to destroy, but root them out of heaven:  The overthrown he raised, and as a herd  Of goats or timorous flock together thronged,  Drove them before him thunderstruck, pursued  With terrors and with furies, to the bounds  And crystal wall of heaven; which, opening wide,  Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed  Into the wasteful deep: the monstrous sight  Struck them with horror backward, but far worse  Urged them behind: headlong themselves they threw  Down from the verge of heaven; eternal wrath  Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.MILTON.       *       *       *       *       *THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB.FROM "HEBREW MELODIES."  The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,  And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;  And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,  When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.  Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,  That host with their banners at sunset were seen:  Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,  That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.  For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,  And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;  And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,  And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still!  And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,  But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride:  And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,  And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.  And there lay the rider distorted and pale.  With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail;  And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,  The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.  And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,  And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;  And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,  Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!LORD BYRON.       *       *       *       *       *THE SCHOOL OF WAR.FROM "TAMBURLAINE."  TAMBURLAINE.--But now, my boys, leave off and list to me,  That mean to teach you rudiments of war:  I'll have you learn to sleep upon the ground,  March in your armor through watery fens,  Sustain the scorching heat and freezing cold,  Hunger and thirst, right adjuncts of the war,  And after this to scale a castle wall,  Besiege a fort, to undermine a town,  And make whole cities caper in the air.  Then next the way to fortify your men:  In champion grounds, what figure serves you best,  For which the quinque-angle form is meet,  Because the corners there may fall more flat  Whereas the fort may fittest be assailed,  And sharpest where the assault is desperate.  The ditches must be deep; the counterscarps  Narrow and steep; the walls made high and broad;  The bulwarks and the rampires large and strong,  With cavalieros and thick counterforts,  And room within to lodge six thousand men.  It must have privy ditches, countermines,  And secret issuings to defend the ditch;  It must have high argins and covered ways,  To keep the bulwark fronts from battery,  And parapets to hide the musketers;  Casemates to place the great artillery;  And store of ordnance, that from every flank  May scour the outward curtains of the fort,  Dismount the cannon of the adverse part,  Murder the foe, and save the walls from breach.  When this is learned for service on the land,  By plain and easy demonstration  I'll teach you how to make the water mount,  That you may dry-foot march through lakes and pools,  Deep rivers, havens, creeks, and little seas,  And make a fortress in the raging waves,  Fenced with the concave of monstrous rock,  Invincible by nature of the place.  When this is done then are ye soldiers,  And worthy sons of Tamburlaine the Great.  CALYPHAS.--My lord, but this is dangerous to be done:  We may be slain or wounded ere we learn.  TAMBURLAINE.--Villain! Art thou the son of Tamburlaine,  And fear'st to die, or with a curtle-axe  To hew thy flesh, and make a gaping wound?  Hast thou beheld a peal of ordnance strike  A ring of pikes, mingled with shot and horse,  Whose shattered limbs, being tossed as high as Heaven,  Hang in the air as thick as sunny motes,  And canst thou, coward, stand in fear of death?  Hast thou not seen my horsemen charge the foe,  Shot through the arms, cut overthwart the hands,  Dyeing their lances with their streaming blood,  And yet at night carouse within my tent,  Filling their empty veins with airy wine,  That, being concocted, turns to crimson blood.--  And wilt thou shun the field for fear of wounds?  View me, thy father, that hath conquered kings,  And with his horse marched round about the earth  Quite void of scars and clear from any wound,  That by the wars lost not a drop of blood,--  And see him lance his flesh to teach you all.            (_He cuts his arm._)  A wound is nothing, be it ne'er so deep;  Blood is the god of war's rich livery,  Now look I like a soldier, and this wound  As great a grace and majesty to me,  As if a chain of gold, enamelled,  Enchased with diamonds, sapphires, rubies,  And fairest pearl of wealthy India,  Were mounted here under a canopy,  And I sate down clothed with a massy robe,  That late adorned the Afric potentate,  Whom I brought bound unto Damascus' walls.  Come, boys, and with your fingers search my wound,  And in my blood wash all your hands at once,  While I sit smiling to behold the sight.  Now, my boys, what think ye of a wound?  CALYPHAS.--I know not what I should think of it; methinks it is a          pitiful sight.  CELEBINUS.--'Tis nothing: give me a wound, father.  AMYRAS.--And me another, my lord.  TAMBURLAINE.--Come, sirrah, give me your arm.  CELEBINUS.--Here, father, cut it bravely, as you did your own.  TAMBURLAINE.--It shall suffice thou darest abide a wound:  My boy, thou shalt not lose a drop of blood  Before we meet the army of the Turk;  But then run desperate through the thickest throngs,  Dreadless of blows, of bloody wounds, and death;  And let the burning of Larissa-walls,  My speech of war, and this my wound you see,  Teach you, my boys, to bear courageous minds,  Fit for the followers of great Tamburlaine!CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.       *       *       *       *       *CATILINE TO THE ROMAN ARMY.FROM "CATILINE," ACT V.

Welcome the clanging shield, the trumpet's yell,--  Welcome the fever of the mounting blood,  That makes wounds light, and battle's crimson toil  Seem but a sport,--and welcome the cold bed,  Where soldiers with their upturned faces lie,--  And welcome wolf's and vulture's hungry throats,  That make their sepulchres! We fight to-night.          (_The soldiery enter._)  Centurions! all is ruined! I disdain  To hide the truth from you. The die is thrown!  And now, let each that wishes for long life  Put up his sword, and kneel for peace to Rome.  Ye all are free to go. What! no man stirs!  Not one! a soldier's spirit in you all?  Give me your hands! (This moisture in my eyes  Is womanish,--'twill pass.) My noble hearts!  Well have you chosen to die! For, in my mind,  The grave is better than o'erburdened life;  Better the quick release of glorious wounds,  Than the eternal taunts of galling tongues;  Better the spear-head quivering in the heart,  Than daily struggle against fortune's curse;  Better, in manhood's muscle and high blood,  To leap the gulf, than totter to its edge  In poverty, dull pain, and base decay.  Once more, I say,--are ye resolved?        (_The soldiers shout_, "All! All!")  Then, each man to his tent, and take the arms  That he would love to die in,--for, _this hour_,  We storm the Consul's camp. A last farewell!           (_He takes their hands._)  When next we meet,--we'll have no time to look,  How parting clouds a soldier's countenance.  Few as we are, we'll rouse them with a peal  That shall shake Rome!

Before proud Rome's imperial throne    In mind's unconquered mood,  As if the triumph were his own,    The dauntless captive stood.  None, to have seen his free-born air,  Had fancied him a captive there.  Though, through the crowded streets of Rome,    With slow and stately tread,  Far from his own loved island home,    That day in triumph led,--  Unbound his head, unbent his knee,  Undimmed his eye, his aspect free.  A free and fearless glance he cast    On temple, arch, and tower,  By which the long procession passed    Of Rome's victorious power;  And somewhat of a scornful smile    Upcurled his haughty lip the while.  And now he stood, with brow serene,    Where slaves might prostrate fall,  Bearing a Briton's manly mien    In Caesar's palace hall;  Claiming, with kindled brow and cheek,  The liberty e'en there to speak.  Nor could Rome's haughty lord withstand    The claim that look preferred,  But motioned with uplifted hand    The suppliant should be heard,--  If he indeed a suppliant were  Whose glance demanded audience there.  Deep stillness fell on all the crowd,    From Claudius on his throne  Down to the meanest slave that bowed    At his imperial throne;  Silent his fellow-captive's grief  As fearless spoke the Island Chief:  "Think not, thou eagle Lord of Rome,    And master of the world,  Though victory's banner o'er thy dome    In triumph now is furled,  I would address thee as thy slave,  But as the bold should greet the brave!  "I might, perchance, could I have deigned    To hold a vassal's throne,  E'en now in Britain's isle have reigned    A king in name alone,  Yet holding, as thy meek ally,  A monarch's mimic pageantry.  "Then through Rome's crowded streets to-day    I might have rode with thee,  Not in a captive's base array,    But fetterless and free,--  If freedom he could hope to find,  Whose bondage is of heart and mind.  "But canst thou marvel that, freeborn,    With heart and soul unquelled,  Throne, crown, and sceptre I should scorn,    By thy permission held?  Or that I should retain my right  Till wrested by a conqueror's might?  "Rome, with her palaces and towers,    By us unwished, unreft,  Her homely huts and woodland bowers    To Britain might have left;  Worthless to you their wealth must be,  But dear to us, for they were free!  "I might have bowed before, but where    Had been thy triumph now?  To my resolve no yoke to bear    Thou ow'st thy laurelled brow;  Inglorious victory had been thine,  And more inglorious bondage mine.  "Now I have spoken, do thy will;    Be life or death my lot,  Since Britain's throne no more I fill,    To me it matters not.  My fame is clear; but on my fate  Thy glory or thy shame must wait."  He ceased; from all around upsprung    A murmur of applause,  For well had truth and freedom's tongue    Maintained their holy cause.  The conqueror was the captive then;  He bade the slave be free again.BERNARD BARTON.       *       *       *       *       *SEMPRONIUS' SPEECH FOR WAR.FROM "CATO," ACT II. SC. 1.    My voice is still for war.  Gods! can a Roman senate long debate  Which of the two to choose, slavery or death?  No; let us rise at once, gird on our swords,  And at the head of our remaining troops  Attack the foe, break through the thick array  Of his thronged legions, and charge home upon him.  Perhaps some arm, more lucky than the rest,  May reach his heart, and free the world from bondage.  Rise! Fathers, rise! 'tis Rome demands your help:  Rise, and revenge her slaughtered citizens,  Or share their fate! The corpse of half her senate  Manures the fields of Thessaly, while we  Sit here deliberating, in cold debate,  If we should sacrifice our lives to honor,  Or wear them out in servitude and chains.  Rouse up, for shame! our brothers of Pharsalia  Point at their wounds, and cry aloud,--"To battle!"  Great Pompey's shade complains that we are slow,  And Scipio's ghost walks unrevenged amongst us.JOSEPH ADDISON.       *       *       *       *       *THE DEATH OF LEONIDAS.  It was the wild midnight,--    A storm was on the sky;  The lightning gave its light,    And the thunder echoed by.  The torrent swept the glen,    The ocean lashed the shore;  Then rose the Spartan men,    To make their bed in gore!  Swift from the deluge ground    Three hundred took the shield;  Then, silent, gathered round    The leader of the field!  He spake no warrior word,    He bade no trumpet blow,  But the signal thunder roared,    And they rushed upon the foe.  The fiery element    Showed, with one mighty gleam,  Rampart, and flag, and tent,    Like the spectres of a dream.  All up the mountain's side,    All down the woody vale,  All by the rolling tide    Waved the Persian banners pale.  And foremost from the pass,    Among the slumbering band,  Sprang King Leonidas,    Like the lightning's living brand.  Then double darkness fell,    And the forest ceased its moan;  But there came a clash of steel,    And a distant dying groan.  Anon, a trumpet blew,    And a fiery sheet burst high,  That o'er the midnight threw    A blood-red canopy.  A host glared on the hill;    A host glared by the bay;  But the Greeks rushed onward still,    Like leopards in their play.  The air was all a yell,    And the earth was all a flame,  Where the Spartan's bloody steel    On the silken turbans came;  And still the Greek rushed on    Where the fiery torrent rolled,  Till like a rising sun    Shone Xerxes' tent of gold.  They found a royal feast,    His midnight banquet, there;  And the treasures of the East    Lay beneath the Doric spear.  Then sat to the repast    The bravest of the brave!  That feast must be their last,    That spot must be their grave.  They pledged old Sparta's name    In cups of Syrian wine,  And the warrior's deathless fame    Was sung in strains divine.  They took the rose-wreathed lyres    From eunuch and from slave,  And taught the languid wires,    The sounds that Freedom gave.  But now the morning star    Crowned Oeta's twilight brow;  And the Persian horn of war    From the hills began to blow.  Up rose the glorious rank,    To Greece one cup poured high,  Then hand in hand they drank,    "To immortality!"  Fear on King Xerxes fell,    When, like spirits from the tomb,  With shout and trumpet knell,    He saw the warriors come.  But down swept all his power,    With chariot and with charge;  Down poured the arrows' shower.    Till sank the Dorian's targe.  They gathered round the tent,    With all their strength unstrung;  To Greece one look they sent,    Then on high their torches flung.  The king sat on the throne,    His captains by his side,  While the flame rushed roaring on,    And their Paean loud replied.  Thus fought the Greek of old!    Thus will he fight again!  Shall not the self-same mould    Bring forth the self-same men?GEORGE CROLY.       *       *       *       *       *SONG OF THE GREEKS.[1821.]    Again to the battle, Achaians!    Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance;  Our land,--the first garden of Liberty's-tree,--  Has been, and shall yet be, the land of the free;    For the cross of our faith is replanted,    The pale dying crescent is daunted,  And we march that the footprints of Mahomet's slaves  May be washed out in blood from our forefathers' graves.    Their spirits are hovering o'er us,    And the sword shall to glory restore us.    Ah! what though no succor advances,    Nor Christendom's chivalrous lances  Are stretched in our aid?--Be the combat our own!  And we'll perish or conquer more proudly alone;    For we've sworn by our country's assaulters,    By the virgins they've dragged from our altars,  By our massacred patriots, our children in chains,  By our heroes of old, and their blood in our veins,    That, living, we will be victorious,    Or that, dying, our deaths shall be glorious.    A breath of submission we breathe not:    The sword that we've drawn we will sheathe not:  Its scabbard is left where our martyrs are laid,  And the vengeance of ages has whetted its blade.    Earth may hide, waves engulf, fire consume us;    But they shall not to slavery doom us:  If they rule, it shall be o'er our ashes and graves:--  But we've smote them already with fire on the waves.    And new triumphs on land are before us;--    To the charge!--Heaven's banner is o'er us.    This day--shall ye blush for its story;    Or brighten your lives with its glory?--  Our women--oh, say, shall they shriek in despair,  Or embrace us from conquest, with wreaths in their hair?    Accursed may his memory blacken,    If a coward there be that would slacken  Till we've trampled the turban, and shown ourselves worth  Being sprung from and named for, the godlike of earth.    Strike home!--and the world shall revere us    As heroes descended from heroes.    Old Greece lightens up with emotion!    Her inlands, her isles of the ocean,  Fanes rebuilt, and fair towns, shall with jubilee ring,  And the Nine shall new hallow their Helicon's spring.    Our hearts shall be kindled in gladness,    That were cold, and extinguished in sadness;  Whilst our maidens shall dance with their white waving arms,  Singing joy to the brave that delivered their charms,--    When the blood of yon Mussulman cravens    Shall have crimsoned the beaks of our ravens!THOMAS CAMPBELL.       *       *       *       *       *MARCO BOZZARIS.[AT LASPI--ANCIENT PLATAEA--AUGUST 20, 1823.]  At midnight, in his guarded tent,    The Turk was dreaming of the hour  When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,    Should tremble at his power.  In dreams, through camp and court, he bore  The trophies of a conqueror;    In dreams his song of triumph heard;  Then wore his monarch's signet-ring,  Then pressed that monarch's throne--a king;  As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,    As Eden's garden bird.  At midnight, in the forest shades,    Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,--  True as the steel of their tried blades,    Heroes in heart and hand.  There had the Persian's thousands stood,  There had the glad earth drunk their blood,    On old Plataea's day;  And now there breathed that haunted air  The sons of sires who conquered there,  With arm to strike, and soul to dare,    As quick, as far, as they.  An hour passed on, the Turk awoke:    That bright dream was his last;  He woke--to hear his sentries shriek,    "To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"  He woke--to die midst flame, and smoke,  And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,    And death-shots falling thick and fast  As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;  And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,    Bozzaris cheer his band:  "Strike--till the last armed foe expires;  Strike--for your altars and your fires;  Strike--for the green graves of your sires,    God, and your native land!"  They fought--like brave men, long and well;    They piled that ground with Moslem slain:  They conquered--but Bozzaris fell,    Bleeding at every vein.  His few surviving comrades saw  His smile when rang their proud hurrah,    And the red field was won;  Then saw in death his eyelids close  Calmly, as to a night's repose,    Like flowers at set of sun.  Come to the bridal chamber, Death,    Come to the mother, when she feels,  For the first time, her first-born's breath;    Come when the blessed seals  That close the pestilence are broke,  And crowded cities wail its stroke;  Come in consumption's ghastly form,  The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;  Come when the heart beats high and warm,    With banquet song and dance and wine,--  And thou art terrible; the tear,  The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,  And all we know, or dream, or fear    Of agony, are thine.  But to the hero, when his sword    Has won the battle for the free,  Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,  And in its hollow tones are heard    The thanks of millions yet to be.  Come when his task of fame is wrought;  Come with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought;    Come in her crowning hour,--and then  Thy sunken eye's unearthly light  To him is welcome as the sight    Of sky and stars to prisoned men;  Thy grasp is welcome as the hand  Of brother in a foreign land;  Thy summons welcome as the cry  That told the Indian isles were nigh    To the world-seeking Genoese,  When the land-wind, from woods of palm,  And orange-groves, and fields of balm,    Blew o'er the Haytian seas.  Bozzaris! with the storied brave    Greece nurtured in her glory's time,  Rest thee; there is no prouder grave,    Even in her own proud clime.  She wore no funeral weeds for thee,    Nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume,  Like torn branch from death's leafless tree,  In sorrow's pomp and pageantry,    The heartless luxury of the tomb.  But she remembers thee as one  Long loved, and for a season gone.  For thee her poet's lyre is wreathed,  Her marble wrought, her music breathed;  For thee she rings the birthday bells;  Of thee her babes' first lisping tells;  For thine her evening prayer is said  At palace couch and cottage bed.  Her soldier, closing with the foe,  Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow;  His plighted maiden, when she fears  For him, the joy of her young years,  Thinks of thy fate, and checks her tears.    And she, the mother of thy boys,  Though in her eye and faded cheek  Is read the grief she will not speak,    The memory of her buried joys,--  And even she who gave thee birth,--  Will, by her pilgrim-circled hearth,    Talk of thy doom without a sigh;  For thou art freedom's now, and fame's,--  One of the few, the immortal names    That were not born to die.FITZ-GREENE HALLECK.       *       *       *       *       *HARMOSAN.  Now the third and fatal conflict for the Persian throne was done,  And the Moslem's fiery valor had the crowning victory won.  Harmosan, the last and boldest the invader to defy,  Captive, overborn by numbers, they were bringing forth to die.  Then exclaimed that noble captive: "Lo, I perish in my thirst;  Give me but one drink of water, and let then arrive the worst!"  In his hand he took the goblet: but awhile the draught forbore,  Seeming doubtfully the purpose of the foeman to explore.  Well might then have paused the bravest--for, around him, angry foes  With a hedge of naked weapons did the lonely man enclose.  "But what fear'st thou?" cried the caliph; "is it, friend, a secret blow?  Fear it not! our gallant Moslems no such treacherous dealing know.  "Thou may'st quench thy thirst securely, for thou shalt not die before  Thou hast drunk that cup of water--this reprieve is thine--no more!"  Quick the satrap dashed the goblet down to earth with ready hand,  And the liquid sank forever, lost amid the burning sand.  "Thou hast said that mine my life is, till the water of that cup  I have drained; then bid thy servants that spilled water gather up!"  For a moment stood the caliph as by doubtful passions stirred--  Then exclaimed: "For ever sacred must remain a monarch's word.  Bring another cup, and straightway to the noble Persian give:  Drink, I said before, and perish--now I bid thee drink and live!"RICHARD CHENEVIX TRENCH.       *       *       *       *       *BATTLE SCENE.FROM "THE CID."  Then cried my Cid--"In charity, as to the rescue--ho!"  With bucklers braced before their breasts, with lances pointing low,  With stooping crests and heads bent down above the saddle-bow,  All firm of hand and high of heart they roll upon the foe.  And he that in a good hour was born, his clarion voice rings out,  And clear above the clang of arms is heard his battle shout:  "Among them, gentlemen! Strike home for the love of charity!  The champion of Bivar is here--Ruy Diaz--I am he!"  Then bearing where Bermuez still maintains unequal fight,  Three hundred lances down they come, their pennons flickering white;  Down go three hundred Moors to earth, a man to every blow;  And when they wheel, three hundred more, as charging back they go.  It was a sight to see the lances rise and fall that day;  The shivered shields and riven mail, to see how thick they lay;  The pennons that went in snow-white came out a gory red;  The horses running riderless, the riders lying dead;  While Moors call on Mohammed, and "St. James!" the Christians cry,  And sixty score of Moors and more in narrow compass lie.From the Spanish.Translation of JOHN ORMSBY.       *       *       *       *       *THE LORD OF BUTRAGO.  "Your horse is faint, my King, my Lord! your gallant horse is sick,--  His limbs are torn, his breast is gored, on his eye the film is thick;  Mount, mount on mine, O mount apace, I pray thee, mount and fly!  Or in my arms I'll lift your Grace,--their trampling hoofs are nigh!  "My King, my King,! you're wounded sore,--the blood runs from your feet;  But only lay a hand before, and I'll lift you to your seat;  Mount, Juan, for they gather fast!--I hear their coming cry,--  Mount, mount, and ride for jeopardy,--I'll save you though I die!  "Stand, noble steed! this hour of need,--be gentle as a lamb;  I'll kiss the foam from off thy mouth,--thy master dear I am,--  Mount, Juan, mount; whate'er betide, away the bridle fling,  And plunge the rowels in his side.--My horse shall save my King!  "Nay, never speak; my sires, Lord King, received their land from yours,  And joyfully their blood shall spring, so be it thine secures;  If I should fly, and thou, my King, be found among the dead,  How could I stand 'mong gentlemen, such scorn on my gray head?  "Castile's proud dames shall never point the finger of disdain,  And say there's one that ran away when our good lords were slain!  I leave Diego in your care,--you'll fill his father's place;  Strike, strike the spur, and never spare--God's blessing on your Grace!"  So spake the brave Montanez, Butrago's lord was he;  And turned him to the coming host in steadfastness and glee;  He flung himself among them, as they came down the hill,--  He died, God wot! but not before his sword had drunk its fill.From the Spanish.Translation of JOHN GIBSON LOCKHART.       *       *       *       *       *HAKON'S DEFIANCE.FROM "HAKON JARL."[Olaf Trygvesoen from Ireland is trying to introduce Christianity, andreclaim his father's kingdom, in Norway, and has invaded the realm ofEarl Hakon, a formidable heathen usurper, who, after defeat in battle,unsuccessfully attempts to have King Olaf assassinated by ThorerKlake, one of his adherents. But Olaf slays Klake, and now visitsHakon, lying hid in a peasant's hut.]  _Enter_ OLAF TRYGVESOeN, _muffled up in a gray cloak,  with a broad hat on his head._  HAKON [_without looking up_].--  My valiant Thorer Klake, hast come at last?  Hast been successful? Dost thou bring to me  What thou didst promise? Answer, Thorer Klake.  OLAF.--All things have happened as they should, my lord;  But pardon Thorer that he does not come  And bring himself King Olaf's head to thee--  'Twas difficult for him. Thor knows he had  A sort of loathing that himself should bring it,  And so he sent me.  HAKON.--Well, 'tis good; away,  And deeply bury it in the dark earth.  I will not look on it myself: my eye  Bears not such sights,--they reappear in dreams.  Bury the body with it. Tell thy lord  That he shall come at once.  OLAF.--He is asleep.  HAKON.--Asleep?  OLAF.--A midday slumber; he lies stretched  Stiffly beneath a shadowy elder-tree.  HAKON.--Then wake him up. [_Aside._] Asleep, Asleep, and after such  A deed--Ha! Thorer, I admire thee;  Thou hast rare courage.     [_Aloud._]   Thrall, go wake him up.  OLAF.--But wilt thou first not look at Olaf's head?  HAKON.--No; I have said no.  OLAF.--Thou dost think, my lord,  That perhaps it is a horrid frightful sight:  It is not so, my lord; for Olaf's head  Looks fresh and sound as any in the land.  HAKON.--Away, I tell thee!  OLAF.--I ne'er saw the like:  I always heard that Hakon was a hero,  Few like him in the North,--and does he fear  To see a lifeless and a corpseless head?  How wouldst thou tremble then, my lord, if thou  Shouldst see it on his body?  HAKON [_turning round angrily_].--  Thrall, thou darest!  Where hast thou got it?  OLAF [_takes his hat off, and throws off his cloak_].--  On my shoulders, Earl.  Forgive me that I bring it thee myself  In such a way: 'twas easiest for me.  HAKON.--What, Olaf! Ha! what treachery is here?  OLAF.--Old gray-beard, spare thy rash, heroic wrath.  Attempt not to fight Olaf, but remember  That he has still his head upon his body,  And that thy impotent, gray-bearded strength  Was only fitting for the headless Olaf.  HAKON [_rushes at him_].--  Ha, Hilfheim!  OLAF [_strikes his sword, and says in a loud voice_].--  So, be quiet now, I say,  And sheathe thy sword again. My followers  Surround the house; my vessels are a match  For all of thine, and I myself have come  To win the country in an honest fight.  Thyself hast urged me with thy plots to do it.  Thou standest like a despicable thrall  In his own pitfall caught at last; but I  Will make no use of these advantages  Which fate has granted me. I am convinced  That I may boldly meet thee face to face.  Thy purpose, as thou seest, has wholly failed,  And in his own blood does thy Thorer swim.  Thou seest 'twere easy for me to have seized thee;  To strike thee down were even easier still:  But I the Christian doctrine do confess,  And do such poor advantages despise.  So choose between two courses. Still be Earl  Of Hlade as thou wast, and do me homage,  Or else take flight; for when we meet again  'Twill be the time for red and bleeding brows.  HAKON [_proudly and quietly_].--  My choice is made. I choose the latter, Olaf.  Thou callest me a villain and a thrall;  That forces up a smile upon my lips.  Olaf, one hears indeed that thou art young;  It is by mockery and arrogance  That one can judge thy age. Now, look at me  Full in the eyes; consider well my brow:  Hast thou among the thralls e'er met such looks?  Dost think that cunning or that cowardice  Could e'er have carved these wrinkles on my brow?  I did entice thee hither. Ha! 'tis true  I knew that thou didst wait but for a sign  To flutter after the enticing bait;  That in thy soul thou didst more highly prize  Thy kinship with an extinct race of kings  Than great Earl Hakon's world-renowned deeds;  That thou didst watch the opportunity  To fall upon the old man in his rest.  Does it astonish thee that I should wish  Quickly to rid myself of such a foe?  That I deceived a dreamer who despised  The mighty gods,--does that astonish thee?  Does it astonish thee that I approved  My warrior's purpose, since a hostile fate  Attempted to dethrone, not only me,  But all Valhalla's gods?  OLAF.--Remember, Hakon,--  Remember, Hakon, that e'en thou thyself  Hast been a Christian; that thou wast baptized  By Bishop Popo, and that thou since then  Didst break thy oath. How many hast thou broken?  HAKON.--Accursed forever may that moment be  When by the cunning monk I was deceived,  And let myself be fooled by paltry tricks.  He held a red-hot iron in his hand,  After by magic he had covered it  With witches' ointment.  OLAF.--O thou blind old man!  Thy silver hair does make me pity thee.  HAKON.--Ha! spare thy pity; as thou seest me here,  Thou seest the last flash and the latest spark  Of ancient Northern force and hero's life;  And that, with all thy fever-stricken dreams,  Proud youth, thou shalt be powerless to quench.  I well do know it is the Christian custom  To pity, to convert, and to amend.  Our custom is to heartily despise you,  To ruminate upon your fall and death,  As foes to gods and to a hero's life.  That Hakon does, and therein does consist  His villainy. By Odin, and by Thor,  Thou shalt not quench old Norway's warlike flame  With all thy misty dreams of piety.  OLAF.--'Tis well: fate shall decide. We separate,  And woe to thee when next we meet again.  HAKON.--Aye, woe to me if then I crush thee not.  OLAF.--Heaven shall strike thee with its fiery might!  HAKON.--No, with his hammer Thor the cross will smite!From the Danish of ADAM GOTTLOB OEHLENSCHLAeGER.Translation of SIR FRANK C.

A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,  There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's          tears;  But a comrade stood beside him, while his life-blood ebbed away,  And bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.  The dying soldier faltered, and he took that comrade's hand,  And he said, "I nevermore shall see my own, my native land;  Take a message, and a token, to some distant friends of mine,  For I was born at Bingen,--at Bingen on the Rhine.  "Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around,  To hear my mournful story, in that pleasant vineyard ground,  That we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done,  Full many a corse lay ghastly pale beneath the setting sun;  And, mid the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,--  The death-wound on their gallant breasts, the last of many scars;  And some were young, and suddenly beheld life's morn decline,--  And one had come from Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.  "Tell my mother that her other son shall comfort her old age;  For I was still a truant bird, that thought his home a cage.  For my father was a soldier, and even as a child  My heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;  And when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard,  I let them take whate'er they would,--but kept my father's sword;  And with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine,  On the cottage wall at Bingen,--calm Bingen on the Rhine.  "Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head,  When the troops come marching home again with glad and gallant          tread,  But to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye,  For her brother was a soldier too, and not afraid to die;  And if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name  To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame,  And to hang the old sword in its place (my father's sword and mine)  For the honor of old Bingen,--dear Bingen on the Rhine.  "There's another,--not a sister; in the happy days gone by  You'd have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;  Too innocent for coquetry,--too fond for idle scorning,--  O friend! I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest          mourning!  Tell her the last night of my life (for, ere the moon be risen,  My body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison),--  I dreamed I stood with _her_, and saw the yellow sunlight shine  On the vine-clad hills of Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.  "I saw the blue Rhine sweep along,--I heard, or seemed to hear,  The German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear;  And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill,  The echoing chorus sounding, through the evening calm and still;  And her glad blue eyes were on me, as we passed, with friendly talk,  Down many a path beloved of yore, and well-remembered walk!  And her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine,--  But we'll meet no more at Bingen,--loved Bingen on the Rhine."  His trembling voice grew faint and hoarse,--his grasp was childish          weak,--  His eyes put on a dying look,--he sighed and ceased to speak;  His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled,--  The soldier of the Legion in a foreign land is dead!  And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down  On the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corses strewn;  Yes, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine,  As it shone on distant Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.CAROLINE ELIZABETH SARAH NORTON.       *       *       *       *       *HOHENLINDEN.[1800.]  On Linden, when the sun was low,  All bloodless lay the untrodden snow,  And dark as winter was the flow  Of Iser, rolling rapidly.  But Linden saw another sight  When the drum beat, at dead of night,  Commanding fires of death to light  The darkness of her scenery.  By torch and trumpet fast arrayed,  Each horseman drew his battle-blade,  And furious every charger neighed,  To join the dreadful revelry.  Then shook the hills with thunder riven,  Then rushed the steeds to battle driven,  And louder than the bolts of heaven  Far flashed the red artillery.  But redder yet that light shall glow  On Linden's hills of stained snow,  And bloodier yet the torrent flow  Of Iser, rolling rapidly.  'Tis morn, but scarce yon level sun  Can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun,  Where furious Frank and fiery Hun  Shout in their sulphurous canopy.  The combat deepens. On, ye brave,  Who rush to glory, or the grave!  Wave, Munich! all thy banners wave,  And charge with all thy chivalry!  Few, few shall part where many meet!  The snow shall be their winding-sheet,  And every turf beneath their feet  Shall be a soldier's sepulchre.THOMAS CAMPBELL.       *       *       *       *       *IVRY.[1590.]  Now glory to the Lord of hosts, from whom all glories are!  And glory to our sovereign liege, King Henry of Navarre!  Now let there be the merry sound of music and the dance,  Through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines, O pleasant land of          France!  And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city of the waters,  Again let raptures light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters;  As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joys;  For cold and stiff and still are they who wrought thy walls annoy.  Hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance of war!  Hurrah! hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre.  Oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,  We saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;  With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,  And Appenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.  There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land;  And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;  An as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,  And good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;  And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,  To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.  The king has come to marshal us, in all his armor drest;  And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.  He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;  He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.  Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,  Down all our line, a deafening shout: God save our lord the king!  "And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may--  For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray--  Press where you see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war,  And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre."  Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din,  Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.  The fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre's plain,  With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.  Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,  Charge for the golden lilies--upon them with the lance!  A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest.  A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;  And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,  Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.  Now, God be praised, the day is ours: Mayenne hath turned his rein;  D'Aumale hath cried for quarter; the Flemish count is slain;  Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;  The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.  And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,  Remember Saint Bartholomew! was passed from man to man.  But out spake gentle Henry--"No Frenchmen is my foe:  Down, down, with every foreigner, but let your brethren go."  Oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,  As our sovereign lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre?  Right well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for France to-day;  And many a lordly banner God gave them for a prey.  But we of the religion have borne us best in fight;  And the good lord of Rosny hath ta'en the cornet white--  Our own true Maximilian the cornet white hath ta'en,  The cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lorraine.  Up with it high; unfurl it wide--that all the host may know  How God hath humbled the proud house which wrought His Church such          woe.  Then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest point of war,  Fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry of Navarre.  Ho! maidens of Vienna; ho! matrons of Lucerne--  Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.  Ho! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,  That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls.  Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be bright;  Ho! burghers of St. Genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night;  For our God hath crushed the tyrant, our God hath raised the slave,  And mocked the counsel of the wise, and the valor of the brave.  Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories are;  And glory to our sovereign lord, King Henry of Navarre!LORD MACAULAY.       *       *       *       *       *INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP.  You know we French stormed Ratisbon:    A mile or so away,  On a little mound, Napoleon    Stood on our storming-day;  With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,    Legs wide, arms locked behind,  As if to balance the prone brow,    Oppressive with its mind.  Just as perhaps he mused, "My plans    That soar, to earth may fall,  Let once my army-leader Lannes    Waver at yonder wall,"  Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew    A rider, bound on bound  Full-galloping; nor bridle drew    Until he reached the mound.  Then off there flung in smiling joy,    And held himself erect  By just his horse's mane, a boy:    You hardly could suspect  (So tight he kept his lips compressed,    Scarce any blood came through),  You looked twice ere you saw his breast    Was all but shot in two.  "Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace    We've got you Ratisbon!  The marshal's in the market-place,    And you'll be there anon  To see your flag-bird flap his vans    Where I, to heart's desire,  Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans    Soared up again like fire.  The chief's eye flashed; but presently    Softened itself, as sheathes  A film the mother-eagle's eye    When her bruised eaglet breathes:  "You're wounded!" "Nay," his soldier's pride    Touched to the quick, he said:  "I'm killed, sire!" And, his chief beside,    Smiling, the boy fell dead.ROBERT BROWNING.       *       *       *       *       *THE BRONZE STATUE OF NAPOLEON.  The work is done! the spent flame burns no more,    The furnace fires smoke and die,  The iron flood boils over. Ope the door,    And let the haughty one pass by!  Roar, mighty river, rush upon your course,    A bound,--and, from your dwelling past,  Dash forward, like a torrent from its source,    A flame from the volcano cast!  To gulp your lava-waves earth's jaws extend,    Your fury in one mass fling forth,--  In your steel mould, O Bronze, a slave descend,    An emperor return to earth!  Again NAPOLEON,--'tis his form appears!    Hard soldier in unending quarrel,  Who cost so much of insult, blood, and tears,    For only a few boughs of laurel!  For mourning France it was a day of grief,    When, down from its high station flung,  His mighty statue, like some shameful thief,    In coils of a vile rope was hung;  When we beheld at the grand column's base,    And o'er a shrieking cable bowed,  The stranger's strength that mighty bronze displace    To hurrahs of a foreign crowd;  When, forced by thousand arms, head-foremost thrown,    The proud mass cast in monarch mould  Made sudden fall, and on the hard, cold stone    Its iron carcass sternly rolled.  The Hun, the stupid Hun, with soiled, rank skin,    Ignoble fury in his glance,  The emperor's form the kennel's filth within    Drew after him, in face of France!  On those within whose bosoms hearts hold reign,    That hour like remorse must weigh  On each French brow,--'tis the eternal stain,    Which only death can wash away!  I saw, where palace-walls gave shade and ease,    The wagons of the foreign force;  I saw them strip the bark which clothed our trees,    To cast it to their hungry horse.  I saw the Northman, with his savage lip,    Bruising our flesh till black with gore,  Our bread devour,--on our nostrils sip    The air which was our own before!  In the abasement and the pain,--the weight    Of outrages no words make known,--  I charged one only being with my hate:    _Be thou accursed, Napoleon!_  O lank-haired Corsican, your France was fair,    In the full sun of Messidor!  She was a tameless and a rebel mare,    Nor steel bit nor gold rein she bore;  Wild steed with rustic flank;--yet, while she trod,--    Reeking with blood of royalty,  But proud with strong foot striking the old sod,    At last, and for the first time, free,--  Never a hand, her virgin form passed o'er,    Left blemish nor affront essayed;  And never her broad sides the saddle bore,    Nor harness by the stranger made.  A noble vagrant,--with coat smooth and bright,    And nostril red, and action proud,--  As high she reared, she did the world affright    With neighings which rang long and loud.  You came; her mighty loins, her paces scanned,    Pliant and eager for the track;  Hot Centaur, twisting in her mane your hand,    You sprang all booted to her back.  Then, as she loved the war's exciting sound,    The smell of powder and the drum,  You gave her Earth for exercising ground,    Bade Battles as her pastimes come!  Then, no repose for her,--no nights, no sleep!    The air and toil for evermore!  And human forms like unto sand crushed deep,    And blood which rose her chest before!  Through fifteen years her hard hoofs' rapid course    So ground the generations,  And she passed smoking in her speed and force    Over the breast of nations;  Till,--tired in ne'er earned goal to place vain trust,    To tread a path ne'er left behind,  To knead the universe and like a dust    To uplift scattered human kind,--  Feebly and worn, and gasping as she trode,    Stumbling each step of her career,  She craved for rest the Corsican who rode.    But, torturer! you would not hear;  You pressed her harder with your nervous thigh,    You tightened more the goading bit,  Choked in her foaming mouth her frantic cry,    And brake her teeth in fury-fit.  She rose,--but the strife came. From farther fall    Saved not the curb she could not know,--  She went down, pillowed on the cannon-ball,    And thou wert broken by the blow!  Now born again, from depths where thou wert hurled,    A radiant eagle dost thou rise;  Winging thy flight again to rule the world,    Thine image reascends the skies.  No longer now the robber of a crown,--    The insolent usurper,--he,  With cushions of a throne, unpitying, down    Who pressed the throat of Liberty,--  Old slave of the Alliance, sad and lone,    Who died upon a sombre rock,  And France's image until death dragged on    For chain, beneath the stranger's stroke,--  NAPOLEON stands, unsullied by a stain:    Thanks to the flatterer's tuneful race  The lying poets who ring praises vain,    Has Caesar 'mong the gods found place!  His image to the city-walls gives light;    His name has made the city's hum,--  Still sounded ceaselessly, as through the fight    It echoed farther than the drum.  From the high suburbs, where the people crowd,    Doth Paris, an old pilgrim now,  Each day descend to greet the pillar proud,    And humble there his monarch brow;--  The arms encumbered with a mortal wreath,    With flowers for that bronze's pall,  (No mothers look on, as they pass beneath,--    It grew beneath their tears so tall!)--  In working-vest, in drunkenness of soul,    Unto the fife's and trumpet's tone,  Doth joyous Paris dance the Carmagnole    Around the great Napoleon.  Thus, Gentle Monarchs, pass unnoted on!    Mild Pastors of Mankind, away!  Sages, depart, as common brows have gone,    Devoid of the immortal ray!  For vainly you make light the people's chain;    And vainly, like a calm flock, come  On your own footsteps, without sweat or pain,    The people,--treading towards their tomb.  Soon as your star doth to its setting glide,    And its last lustre shall be given  By your quenched name,--upon the popular tide    Scarce a faint furrow shall be riven.  Pass, pass ye on! For you no statue high!    Your names shall vanish from the horde:  Their memory is for those who lead to die    Beneath the cannon and the sword;  Their love, for him who on the humid field    By thousands lays to rot their bones;  For him, who bids them pyramids to build,--    And bear upon their backs the stones!From the French of AUGUSTE BARBIER.       *       *       *       *       *ON THE WARRES IN IRELAND.FROM "EPIGRAMS," BOOK IV. EPIGRAM 6.  I praised the speech, but cannot now abide it,  That warre is sweet to those that have not try'd it;  For I have proved it now and plainly see't,  It is so sweet, it maketh all things sweet.  At home Canaric wines and Greek grow lothsome;  Here milk is nectar, water tasteth toothsome.  There without baked, rost, boyl'd, it is no cheere;  Bisket we like, and Bonny Clabo here.  There we complain of one wan roasted chick;  Here meat worse cookt ne're makes us sick.  At home in silken sparrers, beds of Down,  We scant can rest, but still tosse up and down;  Here we can sleep, a saddle to our pillow,  A hedge the Curtaine, Canopy a Willow.  There if a child but cry, O what a spite!  Here we can brook three larums in one night.  There homely rooms must be perfumed with Roses;  Here match and powder ne're offend our noses.  There from a storm of rain we run like Pullets;  Here we stand fast against a shower of bullets.  Lo, then how greatly their opinions erre,  That think there is no great delight in warre;    But yet for this, sweet warre, He be thy debtor,    I shall forever love my home the better.SIR JOHN HARRINGTON.       *       *       *       *       *ALFRED THE HARPER.  Dark fell the night, the watch was set,  The host was idly spread,  The Danes around their watchfires met,  Caroused, and fiercely fed.  The chiefs beneath a tent of leaves  And Guthrum, king of all,  Devoured the flesh of England's beeves,  And laughed at England's fall.  Each warrior proud, each Danish earl,  In mail of wolf-skin clad,  Their bracelets white with plundered pearl,  Their eyes with triumph mad.  From Humber-land to Severn-land,  And on to Tamar stream,  Where Thames makes green the towery strand,  Where Medway's waters gleam,--  With hands of steel and mouths of flame  They raged the kingdom through;  And where the Norseman sickle came,  No crop but hunger grew.  They loaded many an English horse  With wealth of cities fair;  They dragged from many a father's corse  The daughter by her hair.  And English slaves, and gems and gold,  Were gathered round the feast;  Till midnight in their woodland hold,  O, never that riot ceased.  In stalked a warrior tall and rude  Before the strong sea-kings;  "Ye Lords and Earls of Odin's brood,  Without a harper sings.  He seems a simple man and poor,  But well he sounds the lay;  And well, ye Norseman chiefs, be sure,  Will ye the song repay."  In trod the bard with keen cold look,  And glanced along the board,  That with the shout and war-cry shook  Of many a Danish lord.  But thirty brows, inflamed and stern,  Soon bent on him their gaze,  While calm he gazed, as if to learn  Who chief deserved his praise.  Loud Guthrum spake,--"Nay, gaze not thus,  Thou Harper weak and poor!  By Thor! who bandy looks with us  Must worse than looks endure.  Sing high the praise of Denmark's host,  High praise each dauntless Earl;  The brave who stun this English coast  With war's unceasing whirl."  The Harper slowly bent his head,  And touched aloud the string;  Then raised his face, and boldly said,  "Hear thou my lay, O King!  High praise from every mouth of man  To all who boldly strive,  Who fall where first the fight began,  And ne'er go back alive.  "Fill high your cups, and swell the shout,  At famous Regnar's name!  Who sank his host in bloody rout,  When he to Humber came.  His men were chased, his sons were slain,  And he was left alone.  They bound him in an iron chain  Upon a dungeon stone.  "With iron links they bound him fast;  With snakes they filled the hole,  That made his flesh their long repast,  And bit into his soul.  "Great chiefs, why sink in gloom your eyes?  Why champ your teeth in pain?  Still lives the song though Regnar dies!  Fill high your cups again!  Ye too, perchance, O Norseman lords!  Who fought and swayed so long,  Shall soon but live in minstrel words,  And owe your names to song.  "This land has graves by thousands more  Than that where Regnar lies.  When conquests fade, and rule is o'er,  The sod must close your eyes.  How soon, who knows? Not chief, nor bard;  And yet to me 'tis given,  To see your foreheads deeply scarred,  And guess the doom of Heaven.  "I may not read or when or how,  But, Earls and Kings, be sure  I see a blade o'er every brow,  Where pride now sits secure.  Fill high the cups, raise loud the strain!  When chief and monarch fall,  Their names in song shall breathe again,  And thrill the feastful hall."  Grim sat the chiefs; one heaved a groan,  And one grew pale with dread,  His iron mace was grasped by one,  By one his wine was shed.  And Guthrum cried, "Nay, bard, no more  We hear thy boding lay;  Make drunk the song with spoil and gore!  Light up the joyous fray!"  "Quick throbs my brain,"--so burst the song,--  To hear the strife once more.  The mace, the axe, they rest too long;  Earth cries, My thirst is sore.  More blithely twang the strings of bows  Than strings of harps in glee;  Red wounds are lovelier than the rose  Or rosy lips to me.  "O, fairer than a field of flowers,  When flowers in England grew,  Would be the battle's marshalled powers,  The plain of carnage new.  With all its death before my soul  The vision rises fair;  Raise loud the song, and drain the bowl!  I would that I were there!"  Loud rang the harp, the minstrel's eye  Rolled fiercely round the throng;  It seemed two crashing hosts were nigh,  Whose shock aroused the song.  A golden cup King Guthrum gave  To him who strongly played;  And said, "I won it from the slave  Who once o'er England swayed."  King Guthrum cried, "'Twas Alfred's own;  Thy song befits the brave:  The King who cannot guard his throne  Nor wine nor song shall have."  The minstrel took the goblet bright,  And said, "I drink the wine  To him who owns by justest right  The cup thou bid'st be mine.  To him, your Lord, O shout ye all!  His meed be deathless praise!  The King who dares not nobly fall,  Dies basely all his days."  "The praise thou speakest," Guthrum said,  "With sweetness fills mine ear;  For Alfred swift before me fled,  And left me monarch here.  The royal coward never dared  Beneath mine eye to stand.  O, would that now this feast he shared,  And saw me rule his land!"  Then stern the minstrel rose, and spake,  And gazed upon the King,--  "Not now the golden cup I take,  Nor more to thee I sing.  Another day, a happier hour,  Shall bring me here again:  The cup shall stay in Guthrum's power,  Till I demand it then."  The Harper turned and left the shed,  Nor bent to Guthrum's crown;  And one who marked his visage said  It wore a ghastly frown.  The Danes ne'er saw that Harper more,  For soon as morning rose,  Upon their camp King Alfred bore,  And slew ten thousand foes.JOHN STERLING.       *       *       *       *       *CHEVY-CHACE.[A modernized form of the old ballad of the "Hunting o' the Cheviot."Some circumstances of the battle of Olter-bourne (A.D. 1388) arewoven into the ballad, and the affairs of the two events areconfounded. The ballad preserved in the "Percy Reliques" is probablyas old as 1574. The one following is not later than the time ofCharles II]  God prosper long our noble king,    Our lives and safeties all;  A woful hunting once there did    In Chevy-Chace befall.  To drive the deer with hound and horn    Earl Piercy took his way;  The child may rue that is unborn    The hunting of that day.  The stout Earl of Northumberland    A vow to God did make,  His pleasure in the Scottish woods    Three summer days to take,--  The chiefest harts in Chevy-Chace    To kill and bear away.  These tidings to Earl Douglas came,    In Scotland where he lay;  Who sent Earl Piercy present word    He would prevent his sport.  The English earl, not fearing that,    Did to the woods resort.  With fifteen hundred bowmen bold,    All chosen men of might,  Who knew full well in time of need    To aim their shafts aright.  The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran    To chase the fallow deer;  On Monday they began to hunt,    When daylight did appear;  And long before high noon they had    A hundred fat bucks slain;  Then, having dined, the drovers went    To rouse the deer again.  The bowmen mustered on the hills,    Well able to endure;  And all their rear, with special care,    That day was guarded sure.  The hounds ran swiftly through the woods    The nimble deer to take,  That with their cries the hills and dales    An echo shrill did make.  Lord Piercy to the quarry went,    To view the slaughtered deer;  Quoth he, "Earl Douglas promised    This day to meet me here;  "But if I thought he would not come,    No longer would I stay;"  With that a brave young gentleman    Thus to the earl did say:--  "Lo, yonder doth Earl Douglas come,--    His men in armor bright;  Full twenty hundred Scottish spears    All marching in our sight;  "All men of pleasant Tividale,    Fast by the river Tweed;"  "Then cease your sports," Earl Piercy said,    "And take your bows with speed;  "And now with me, my countrymen,    Your courage forth advance;  For never was there champion yet,    In Scotland or in France,  "That ever did on horseback come,    But if my hap it were,  I durst encounter man for man,    With him to break a spear."  Earl Douglas on his milk-white steed,    Most like a baron bold,  Rode foremost of his company,    Whose armor shone like gold.  "Show me," said he, "whose men you be,    That hunt so boldly here,  That, without my consent, do chase    And kill my fallow-deer."  The first man that did answer make,    Was noble Piercy, he--  Who said, "We list not to declare,    Nor show whose men we be:  "Yet will we spend our dearest blood    Thy chiefest harts to slay."  Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,    And thus in rage did say:--  "Ere thus I will out-braved be,    One of us two shall die;  I know thee well, an earl thou art,--    Lord Piercy, so am I.  "But trust me, Piercy, pity it were,    And great offence, to kill  Any of these our guiltless men,    For they have done no ill.  "Let you and me the battle try,    And set our men aside."  "Accursed be he," Earl Piercy said,    "By whom this is denied."  Then stepped a gallant squire forth,    Witherington was his name,  Who said, "I would not have it told    To Henry, our king, for shame,  "That e'er my captain fought on foot,    And I stood looking on.  You two be earls," said Witherington,    "And I a squire alone;  "I'll do the best that do I may,    While I have power to stand;  While I have power to wield my sword    I'll fight with heart and hand."  Our English archers bent their bows,--    Their hearts were good and true;  At the first flight of arrows sent,    Full fourscore Scots they slew.  Yet stays Earl Douglas on the bent,    As chieftain stout and good;  As valiant captain, all unmoved,    The shock he firmly stood.  His host he parted had in three,    As leader ware and tried;  And soon his spearmen on their foes    Bore down on every side.  Throughout the English archery    They dealt full many a wound;  But still our valiant Englishmen    All firmly kept their ground.  And throwing straight their bows away,    They grasped their swords so bright;  And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,    On shields and helmets light.  They closed full fast on every side,--    No slackness there was found;  And many a gallant gentleman    Lay gasping on the ground.  In truth, it was a grief to see    How each one chose his spear,  And how the blood out of their breasts    Did gush like water clear.  At last these two stout earls did meet;    Like captains of great might,  Like lions wode, they laid on lode,    And made a cruel fight.  They fought until they both did sweat,    With swords of tempered steel,  Until the blood, like drops of rain,    They trickling down did feel.  "Yield thee, Lord Piercy," Douglas said,    "In faith I will thee bring  Where thou shalt high advanced be    By James, our Scottish king.  "Thy ransom I will freely give,    And this report of thee,--  Thou art the most courageous knight    That ever I did see."  "No, Douglas," saith Earl Piercy then,    "Thy proffer I do scorn;  I will not yield to any Scot    That ever yet was born."  With that there came an arrow keen    Out of an English bow,  Which struck Earl Douglas to the heart,--    A deep and deadly blow;  Who never spake more words than these:    "Fight on, my merry men all;  For why, my life is at an end;    Lord Piercy sees my fall."  Then leaving life, Earl Piercy took    The dead man by the hand;  And said, "Earl Douglas, for thy life    Would I had lost my land.  "In truth, my very heart doth bleed    With sorrow for thy sake;  For sure a more redoubted knight    Mischance did never take."  A knight amongst the Scots there was    Who saw Earl Douglas die,  Who straight in wrath did vow avenge    Upon the Earl Piercy.  Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he called,    Who, with a spear full bright,  Well mounted on a gallant steed,    Ran fiercely through the fight;  And past the English archers all,    Without a dread or fear;  And through Earl Piercy's body then    He thrust his hateful spear.  With such vehement force and might    He did his body gore,  The staff ran through the other side    A large cloth-yard and more.  So thus did both these nobles die,    Whose courage none could stain.  An English archer then perceived    The noble earl was slain.  He had a bow bent in his hand,    Made of a trusty tree;  An arrow of a cloth-yard long    To the hard head haled he.  Against Sir Hugh Mountgomery    So right the shaft he set,  The gray goose wing that was thereon    In his heart's blood was wet.  This fight did last from break of day    Till setting of the sun;  For when they rung the evening-bell    The battle scarce was done.  With stout Earl Piercy there were slain    Sir John of Egerton,  Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,    Sir James, that bold baron.  And with Sir George and stout Sir James,    Both knights of good account.  Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slain,    Whose prowess did surmount.  For Witherington my heart is woe    That ever he slain should be,  For when his legs were hewn in two,    He knelt and fought on his knee.  And with Earl Douglas there was slain    Sir Hugh Mountgomery,  Sir Charles Murray, that from the field    One foot would never flee;  Sir Charles Murray of Ratcliff, too,--    His sister's son was he;  Sir David Lamb, so well esteemed,    But saved he could not be.  And the Lord Maxwell in like case    Did with Earl Douglas die:  Of twenty hundred Scottish spears,    Scarce fifty-five did fly.  Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,    Went home but fifty-three;  The rest in Chevy-Chace were slain,    Under the greenwood tree.  Next day did many widows come,    Their husbands to bewail;  They washed their wounds in brinish tears.    But all would not prevail.  Their bodies, bathed in purple blood,    They bore with them away;  They kissed them dead a thousand times,    Ere they were clad in clay.  The news was brought to Edinburgh,    Where Scotland's king did reign,  That brave Earl Douglas suddenly    Was with an arrow slain:  "O heavy news," King James did say;    "Scotland can witness be  I have not any captain more    Of such account as he."  Like tidings to King Henry came    Within as short a, space,  That Piercy of Northumberland    Was slain in Chevy-Chace:  "Now God be with him," said our King,    "Since 'twill no better be;  I trust I have within my realm    Five hundred as good as he:  "Yet shall not Scots or Scotland say    But I will vengeance take;  I'll be revenged on them all    For brave Earl Piercy's sake."  This vow full well the king performed    After at Humbledown;  In one day fifty knights were slain    With lords of high renown;  And of the rest, of small account,    Did many hundreds die:  Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chace,    Made by the Earl Piercy.  God save the king, and bless this land,    With plenty, joy, and peace;  And grant, henceforth, that foul debate    'Twixt noblemen may cease.ANONYMOUS.       *       *       *       *       *SIR PATRICK SPENS.[A confused echo of the Scotch expedition which should have broughtthe Maid of Norway to Scotland, about 1285.]  The king sits in Dunfermline town,    Drinking the blude-red wine,  "O whare will I get a skeely skipper,    To sail this new ship of mine!"  O up and spake an eldern knight,    Sat at the king's right knee,--  "Sir Patrick Spens is the best sailor,    That ever sailed the sea."  Our king has written a braid letter,    And sealed it with his hand,  And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens,    Was walking on the strand.  "To Noroway, to Noroway,    To Noroway o'er the faem;  The king's daughter of Noroway,    'Tis thou maun bring her hame."  The first word that Sir Patrick read,    Sae loud loud laughed he;  The neist word that Sir Patrick read,    The tear blinded his e'e.  "O wha is this has done this deed,    And tauld the king o' me,  To send us out, at this time of the year,    To sail upon the sea?  "Be it wind, be it weet, be it hail, be it sleet,    Our ship must sail the faem;  The king's daughter of Noroway,    'Tis we must fetch her hame."  They hoysed their sails on Monenday morn,    Wi' a' the speed they may;  They hae landed in Noroway,    Upon a Wodensday.  They hadna been a week, a week,    In Noroway, but twae,  When that the lords o' Noroway    Began aloud to say,--  "Ye Scottishmen spend a' our king's goud,    And a' our queenis fee."  "Ye lie, ye lie, ye liars loud!    Fu' loud I hear ye lie.  "For I brought as much white monic,    As gane[A] my men and me,  And I brought a half-fou[B] o' gude red goud,    Out o'er the sea wi' me.  "Make ready, make ready, my merrymen a'!    Our gude ship sails the morn."  "Now, ever alake, my master dear,    I fear a deadly storm!  "I saw the new moon, late yestreen,    Wi' the auld moon in her arm;  And, if we gang to sea, master,    I fear we'll come to harm."  They hadna sailed a league, a league,    A league but barely three,  When the lift grew dark, and the wind blew loud,    And gurly grew the sea.  The ankers brak, and the topmasts lap,    It was sic a deadly storm;  And the waves cam o'er the broken ship,    Till a' her sides were torn.  "O where will I get a gude sailor,    To take my helm in hand,  Till I get up to the tall top-mast,    To see if I can spy land?"  "O here am I, a sailor gude,    To take the helm in hand,  Till you go up to the tall top-mast;    But I fear you'll ne'er spy land."  He hadna gane a step, a step,    A step but barely are,  When a bout flew out of our goodly ship,    And the salt sea it came in.  "Gae, fetch a web o' silken claith,    Another o' the twine,  And wap them into our ship's side,    And let na the sea come in."  They fetched a web o' the silken claith,    Another o' the twine,  And they wapped them round that gude ship's side,    But still the sea came in.  O laith, laith, were our gude Scots lords    To weet their cork-heeled shoon!  But lang or a' the play was played,    They wat their hats aboon.  And mony was the feather-bed,    That flattered on the faem;  And mony was the gude lord's son,    That never mair cam hame.  The ladyes wrang their fingers white,    The maidens tore their hair,  A' for the sake of their true loves;    For them they'll see na mair.  O lang, lang, may the ladyes sit,    Wi' their fans into their hand,  Before they see Sir Patrick Spens    Come sailing to the strand!  And lang, lang, may the maidens sit,    Wi' their goud kaims in their hair,  A' waiting for their ain dear loves!    For them they'll see na mair.

"Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,    And put on your armor so bright,  And take better care of your youngest sister,    For your eldest's awa the last night."  He's mounted her on a milk-white steed,    And himself on a dapple grey,  With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,    And lightly they rade away.  Lord William lookit o'er his left shoulder,    To see what he could see,  And there he spyed her seven brethren bold,    Come riding over the lea.  "Light down, light down, Lady Marg'ret," he said,    "And hold my steed in your hand,  Until that against your seven brothers bold,    And your father, I mak a stand."  She held his steed in her milk-white hand,    And never shed one tear,  Until that she saw her seven brethren fa',    And her father hard fighting, who loved her so dear.  "O hold your hand, Lord William!" she said,    "For your strokes they are wond'rous sair;  True lovers I can get many a ane,    But a father I can never get mair."  O she's ta'en out her handkerchief,    It was o' the holland sae fine,  And aye she dighted her father's bloody wounds,    That were redder than the wine.  "O chuse, O chuse, Lady Marg'ret," he said,    "O whether will ye gang or bide?"  "I'll gang, I'll gang, Lord William," she said,    "For ye have left me no other guide."  He's lifted her on a milk-white steed,    And himself on a dapple grey,  With a bugelet horn hung down by his side,    And slowly they baith rade away.  O they rade on, and on they rade,    And a' by the light of the moon,  Until they cam to yon wan water,    And there they lighted down.  They lighted down to tak a drink    Of the spring that ran sae clear;  And down the stream ran his gude heart's blood,    And sair she gan to fear.  "Hold up, hold up, Lord William," she says,    "For I fear that you are slain!"  "'Tis naething but the shadow of my scarlet cloak,    That shines in the water sae plain."  O they rade on, and on they rade,    And a' by the light of the moon,  Until they cam to his mother's ha' door,    And there they lighted down.

Oh, it's twenty gallant gentlemen    Rode out to hunt the deer,  With mirth upon the silver horn    And gleam upon the spear;  They galloped through the meadow-grass,    They sought the forest's gloom,  And loudest rang Sir Morven's laugh,    And lightest tost his plume.      There's no delight by day or night        Like hunting in the morn;      So busk ye, gallant gentlemen,        And sound the silver horn!  They rode into the dark greenwood    By ferny dell and glade,  And now and then upon their cloaks    The yellow sunshine played;  They heard the timid forest-birds    Break off amid their glee,  They saw the startled leveret,    But not a stag did see.      Wind, wind the horn, on summer morn!        Though ne'er a buck appear,      There's health for horse and gentleman        A-hunting of the deer!  They panted up Ben Lomond's side    Where thick the leafage grew,  And when they bent the branches back    The sunbeams darted through;  Sir Morven in his saddle turned,    And to his comrades spake,  "Now quiet! we shall find a stag    Beside the Brownies' Lake.      Then sound not on the bugle-horn,        Bend bush and do not break,      Lest ye should start the timid hart        A-drinking at the lake."  Now they have reached the Brownies' Lake,--    A blue eye in the wood,--  And on its brink a moment's space    All motionless they stood;  When, suddenly, the silence broke    With fifty bowstrings' twang,  And hurtling through the drowsy air    Full fifty arrows sang.      Ah, better for those gentlemen,        Than horn and slender spear,      Were morion and buckler true,        A-hunting of the deer.  Not one of that brave company    Shall hunt the deer again;  Some fell beside the Brownies' Pool,    Some dropt in dell or glen;  An arrow pierced Sir Morven's breast,    His horse plunged in the lake,  And swimming to the farther bank    He left a bloody wake.      Ah, what avails the silver horn,        And what the slender spear?      There's other quarry in the wood        Beside the fallow deer!  O'er ridge and hollow sped the horse    Besprent with blood and foam,  Nor slackened pace until at eve    He brought his master home.  How tenderly the Lady Ruth    The cruel dart withdrew!  "False Tirrell shot the bolt," she said,    "That my Sir Morven slew!"      Deep in the forest lurks the foe,        While gayly shines the morn:      Hang up the broken spear, and blow        A dirge upon the horn.WILLIAM ROSCOE THAYER _(Paul Hermes_).       *       *       *       *       *THE BALLAD OF AGINCOURT.[1415.]  Fair stood the wind for France,  When we our sails advance,  Nor now to prove our chance      Longer will tarry;  But putting to the main,  At Kause, the mouth of Seine,  With all his martial train,      Landed King Harry,  And taking many a fort,  Furnished in warlike sort,  Marched towards Agincourt      In happy hour,--  Skirmishing day by day  With those that stopped his way,  Where the French general lay      With all his power,  Which in his height of pride,  King Henry to deride,  His ransom to provide      To the king sending;  Which he neglects the while,  As from a nation vile,  Yet, with an angry smile,      Their fall portending.  And turning to his men,  Quoth our brave Henry then:  Though they to one be ten,      Be not amazed;  Yet have we well begun,  Battles so bravely won  Have ever to the sun      By fame been raised.  And for myself, quoth he,  This my full rest shall be;  England ne'er mourn for me,      Nor more esteem me,  Victor I will remain,  Or on this earth lie slain;  Never shall she sustain      Loss to redeem me.  Poitiers and Cressy tell,  When most their pride did swell,  Under our swords they fell;      No less our skill is  Than when our grandsire great,  Claiming the regal seat,  By many a warlike feat      Lopped the French lilies.  The Duke of York so dread  The eager vaward led;  With the main Henry sped,      Amongst his henchmen,  Excester had the rear,--  A braver man not there:  O Lord! how hot they were      On the false Frenchmen!  They now to fight are gone;  Armor on armor shone;  Drum now to drum did groan,--      To hear was wonder;  That with the cries they make  The very earth did shake;  Trumpet to trumpet spake,      Thunder to thunder.  Well it thine age became,  O noble Erpingham!  Which did the signal aim      To our hid forces;  When, from a meadow by,  Like a storm, suddenly.  The English archery      Struck the French horses  With Spanish yew so strong,  Arrows a cloth-yard long,  That like to serpents stung,      Piercing the weather;  None from his fellow starts,  But playing manly parts,  And, like true English hearts,      Stuck close together.  When down their bows they threw,  And forth their bilboes drew,  And on the French they flew,      Not one was tardy;  Arms were from shoulders sent;  Scalps to the teeth were rent;  Down the French peasants went;      Our men were hardy.  This while our noble king,  His broadsword brandishing,  Down the French host did ding,      As to o'erwhelm it;  And many a deep wound lent,  His arms with blood besprent,  And many a cruel dent      Bruised his helmet.  Glo'ster, that duke so good,  Next of the royal blood,  For famous England stood      With his brave brother,  Clarence, in steel so bright,  Though but a maiden knight,  Yet in that furious fight      Scarce such another.  Warwick in blood did wade;  Oxford the foe invade,  And cruel slaughter made,    Still as they ran up.  Suffolk his axe did ply;  Beaumont and Willoughby  Bare them right doughtily,      Ferrers and Fanhope.  Upon Saint Crispin's day  Fought was this noble fray,  Which fame did not delay      To England to carry;  O, when shall Englishmen  With such acts fill a pen,  Or England breed again      Such a King Harry?MICHAEL DRAYTON.       *       *       *       *       *THE KING TO HIS SOLDIERS BEFORE HARFLEUR.[1415.]FROM "KING HENRY V.," ACT III.

Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide;  Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit  To his full height!--On, on, you noblest English,  Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!  Fathers, that, like so many Alexanders,  Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought,  And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.  Dishonor not your mothers; now attest,  That those whom you called fathers, did beget you!  Be copy now to men of grosser blood,  And teach them how to war!--And you, good yeomen,  Whose limbs were made in England, show us here  The mettle of your pasture; let us swear  That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not;  For there is none of you so mean and base,  That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.

O, wherefore come ye forth, in triumph from the north,  With your hands and your feet and your raiment all red?  And wherefore doth your rout send forth a joyous shout?  And whence be the grapes of the wine-press that ye tread?  O, evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit,  And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we trod:  For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong,  Who sate in the high places and slew the saints of God.  It was about the noon of a glorious day of June,  That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses shine,  And the man of blood was there, with his long essenced hair,  And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine.  Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his sword,  The General rode along us to form us to the fight;  When a murmuring sound broke out, and swelled into a shout  Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant's right.  And hark! like the roar of the billows on the shore,  The cry of battle rises along their charging line!  For God! for the cause!--for the Church! for the laws!  For Charles, king of England, and Rupert of the Rhine!  The furious German comes, with his clarions and his drums,  His bravoes of Alsatia, and pages of Whitehall;  They are bursting on our flanks. Grasp your pikes! Close your ranks!  For Rupert never comes but to conquer, or to fall.  They are here! They rush on! We are broken! We are gone!  Our left is borne before them like stubble on the blast.  O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the right!  Stand back to back, in God's name! and fight it to the last!  Stout Skippon hath a wound; the centre hath given ground:  Hark! hark! what means the trampling of horsemen on our rear?  Whose banner do I see, boys? 'Tis he! thank God! 'tis he, boys!  Bear up another minute! Brave Oliver is here.  Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row,  Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dikes,  Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the Accurst,  And at a shock have scattered the forest of his pikes.  Fast, fast the gallants ride, in some safe nook to hide  Their coward heads, predestined to rot on Temple Bar;  And he,--he turns, he flies:--shame on those cruel eyes  That bore to look on torture, and dare not look on war!  Ho! comrades, scour the plain; and, ere ye strip the slain,  First give another stab to make your search secure;  Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broadpieces and lockets,  The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor.  Fools! your doublets shone with gold, and your hearts were gay and bold,  When you kissed your lily hands to your lemans to-day;  And to-morrow shall the fox, from her chambers in the rocks,  Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey.  Where be your tongues that late mocked at heaven and hell and fate?  And the fingers that once were so busy with your blades,  Your perfumed satin clothes, your catches and your oaths!  Your stage-plays and your sonnets, your diamonds and your spades?  Down! down! forever down, with the mitre and the crown!  With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of the Pope!  There is woe in Oxford halls; there is wail in Durham's stalls;  The Jesuit smites his bosom; the bishop rends his cope.  And she of the seven hills shall mourn her children's ills,  And tremble when she thinks on the edge of England's sword;  And the kings of earth in fear shall shudder when they hear  What the hand of God hath wrought for the Houses and the Word!THOMAS BABINGTON, LORD MACAULAY.       *       *       *       *       *THE THREE SCARS.  This I got on the day that Goring  Fought through York, like a wild beast roaring--  The roofs were black, and the streets were full,  The doors built up with packs of wool;  But our pikes made way through a storm of shot,  Barrel to barrel till locks grew hot;  Frere fell dead, and Lucas was gone,  But the drum still beat and the flag went on.  This I caught from a swinging sabre,  All I had from a long night's labor;  When Chester[A] flamed, and the streets were red,  In splashing shower fell the molten lead,  The fire sprang up, and the old roof split,  The fire-ball burst in the middle of it;  With a clash and a clang the troopers they ran,  For the siege was over ere well began.  This I got from a pistol butt  (Lucky my head's not a hazel nut);  The horse they raced, and scudded and swore;  There were Leicestershire gantlemen, seventy score;  Up came the "Lobsters," covered with steel--  Down we went with a stagger and reel;  Smash at the flag, I tore it to rag.  And carried it off in my foraging bag.[Footnote A: Siege of Chester, in the civil war, 1645.]GEORGE WALTER THORNBURY.       *       *       *       *       *FONTENOY.[May 11, 1745.]  Thrice at the huts of Fontenoy the English column failed,  And twice the lines of Saint Antoine the Dutch in vain assailed;  For town and slope were filled with fort and flanking battery,  And well they swept the English ranks and Dutch auxiliary.  As vainly through De Barri's wood the British soldiers burst,  The French artillery drove them back diminished and dispersed.  The bloody Duke of Cumberland beheld with anxious eye,  And ordered up his last reserve, his latest chance to try.  On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, how fast his generals ride!  And mustering came his chosen troops like clouds at eventide.  Six thousand English veterans in stately column tread;  Their cannon blaze in front and flank, Lord Hay is at their head.  Steady they step adown the slopes, steady they mount the hill,  Steady they load, steady they fire, moving right onward still,  Betwixt the wood and Fontenoy, as through a furnace-blast,  Through rampart, trench, and palisade, and bullets showering fast;  And on the open plain above they rose and kept their course,  With ready fire and grim resolve that mocked at hostile force.  Past Fontenoy, past Fontenoy, while thinner grow their ranks,  They break as breaks the Zuyder Zee through Holland's ocean-banks.  More idly than the summer flies, French tirailleurs rush round;  As stubble to the lava-tide, French squadrons strew the ground;  Bombshells and grape and round-shot tore, still on they marched and          fired;  Fast from each volley grenadier and voltigeur retired.  "Push on my household cavalry," King Louis madly cried.  To death they rush, but rude their shock, not unavenged they died.  On through the camp the column trod--King Louis turned his rein.  "Not yet, my liege," Saxe interposed; "the Irish troops remain."  And Fontenoy, famed Fontenoy, had been a Waterloo,  Had not these exiles ready been, fresh, vehement, and true.  "Lord Clare," he said, "you have your wish; there are your Saxon foes!"  The Marshal almost smiles to see how furiously he goes.  How fierce the look these exiles wear, who're wont to be so gay!  The treasured wrongs of fifty years are in their hearts to-day:  The treaty broken ere the ink wherewith 'twas writ could dry;  Their plundered homes, their ruined shrines, their women's parting cry;  Their priesthood hunted down like wolves, their country overthrown--  Each looks as if revenge for all were staked on him alone.  On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, nor ever yet elsewhere,  Rushed on to fight a nobler band than these proud exiles were.  O'Brien's voice is hoarse with joy, as, halting, he commands:  "Fix bayonets--charge!" Like mountain-storm rush on those fiery bands.  Thin is the English column now, and faint their volleys grow,  Yet mustering all the strength they have, they make a gallant show.  They dress their ranks upon the hill, to face that battle-wind!  Their bayonets the breakers' foam, like rocks the men behind!  One volley crashes from their line, when through the surging smoke,  With empty guns clutched in their hands, the headlong Irish broke.  On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, hark to that fierce huzza!  "Revenge! remember Limerick! dash down the Sacsanagh!"  Like lions leaping at a fold, when mad with hunger's pang,  Right up against the English line the Irish exiles sprang;  Bright was their steel, 'tis bloody now, their guns are filled with          gore;  Through scattered ranks and severed files and trampled flags they tore.  The English strove with desperate strength, paused, rallied, scattered,          fled;  The green hillside is matted close with dying and with dead.  Across the plain and far away passed on that hideous wrack,  While cavalier and fantassin dash in upon their track.  On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, like eagles in the sun,  With bloody plumes the Irish stand--the field is fought and won!THOMAS OSBORNE DAVIS.       *       *       *       *       *BATTLE OF THE BALTIC.[April 2, 1801.]  Of Nelson and the north    Sing the glorious day's renown,  When to battle fierce came forth    All the might of Denmark's crown,  And her arms along the deep proudly shone;    By each gun the lighted brand    In a bold determined hand,    And the prince of all the land  Led them on.  Like leviathans afloat    Lay their bulwarks on the brine;  While the sign of battle flew    On the lofty British line--  It was ten of April morn by the chime.    As they drifted on their path    There was silence deep as death;    And the boldest held his breath  For a time.  But the might of England flushed    To anticipate the scene;  And her van the fleeter rushed    O'er the deadly space between.  "Hearts of oak!" our captain cried; when each gun    From its adamantine lips    Spread a death-shade round the ships,    Like the hurricane eclipse  Of the sun.  Again! again! again!    And the havoc did not slack,  Till a feeble cheer the Dane    To our cheering sent us back;  Their shots along the deep slowly boom--    Then ceased--and all is wail,    As they strike the shattered sail,    Or in conflagration pale,  Light the gloom.  Out spoke the victor then,    As he hailed them o'er the wave:  "Ye are brothers! ye are men!    And we conquer but to save;  So peace instead of death let us bring;    But yield, proud foe, thy fleet,    With the crews, at England's feet,    And make submission meet  To our king."  Then Denmark blessed our chief,    That he gave her wounds repose;  And the sounds of joy and grief    From her people wildly rose,  As death withdrew his shades from the day.    While the sun looked smiling bright    O'er a wide and woful sight,    Where the fires of funeral light  Died away.  Now joy, old England, raise!    For the tidings of thy might,  By the festal cities' blaze,    Whilst the wine-cup shines in light;  And yet, amidst that joy and uproar,    Let us think of them that sleep    Full many a fathom deep,    By thy wild and stormy steep,  Elsinore!  Brave hearts! to Britain's pride    Once so faithful and so true,  On the deck of fame that died,    With the gallant good Riou--  Soft sigh the winds of heaven o'er their grave!    While the billow mournful rolls,    And the mermaid's song condoles,    Singing glory to the souls  Of the brave!THOMAS CAMPBELL.       *       *       *       *       *BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.[Corunna, Spain, January 16, 1809.]  Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,    As his corse to the rampart we hurried;  Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot    O'er the grave where our hero we buried.  We buried him darkly, at dead of night,    The sods with our bayonets turning;  By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,    And the lanthorn dimly burning.  No useless coffin enclosed his breast,    Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;  But he lay, like a warrior taking his rest,    With his martial cloak around him.  Few and short were the prayers we said,    And we spoke not a word of sorrow;  But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,    And we bitterly thought of the morrow.  We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,    And smoothed down his lonely pillow.  That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,    And we far away on the billow!  Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,    And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him,  But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on    In the grave where a Briton has laid him!  But half of our heavy task was done,    When the clock struck the hour for retiring;  And we heard the distant and random gun    That the foe was sullenly firing.  Slowly and sadly we laid him down,    From the field of his fame fresh and gory;  We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone--    But we left him alone with his glory.CHARLES WOLFE.       *       *       *       *       *"PICCIOLA."  It was a Sergeant old and gray,     Well singed and bronzed from siege and pillage,  Went tramping in an army's wake     Along the turnpike of the village.  For days and nights the winding host     Had through the little place been marching,  And ever loud the rustics cheered,     Till every throat was hoarse and parching.  The Squire and Farmer, maid and dame,     All took the sight's electric stirring,  And hats were waved and staves were sung,     And kerchiefs white were countless whirring.  They only saw a gallant show     Of heroes stalwart under banners,  And, in the fierce heroic glow,    'Twas theirs to yield but wild hosannas.  The Sergeant heard the shrill hurrahs,     Where he behind in step was keeping;  But glancing down beside the road     He saw a little maid sit weeping.  "And how is this?" he gruffly said,     A moment pausing to regard her;--  "Why weepest thou, my little chit?"     And then she only cried the harder.  "And how is this, my little chit?"    The sturdy trooper straight repeated,  "When all the village cheers us on,    That you, in tears, apart are seated?  "We march two hundred thousand strong,    And that's a sight, my baby beauty,  To quicken silence into song    And glorify the soldier's duty."  "It's very, very grand, I know,"    The little maid gave soft replying;  "And Father, Mother, Brother too,    All say 'Hurrah' while I am crying;  "But think--O Mr. Soldier, think,--    How many little sisters' brothers  Are going all away to fight    And may be _killed_, as well as others!"  "Why, bless thee, child," the Sergeant said,    His brawny hand her curls caressing,  "'Tis left for little ones like thee    To find that War's not all a blessing."  And "Bless thee!" once again he cried;    Then cleared his throat and looked indignant,  And marched away with wrinkled brow    To stop the struggling tear benignaut.  And still the ringing shouts went up    From doorway, thatch, and fields of tillage;  The pall behind the standard seen    By one alone of all the village.  The oak and cedar bend and writhe    When roars the wind through gap and braken;  But 'tis the tenderest reed of all    That trembles first when Earth is shaken.ROBERT HENRY NEWELL.       *       *       *       *       *WATERLOO.[June 15, 1815.]FROM "CHILDE HAROLD," CANTO III.    There was a sound of revelry by night,    And Belgium's capital had gathered then    Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright    The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;    A thousand hearts beat happily; and when    Music arose with its voluptuous swell,    Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,    And all went merry as a marriage-bell;  But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!    Did ye not hear it?--No; 'twas but the wind,    Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;    On with the dance! let joy be unconfined!    No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet    To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet,--    But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,    As if the clouds its echo would repeat;    And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!  Arm! arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!    Within a windowed niche of that high hall    Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear    That sound the first amidst the festival,    And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;    And when they smiled because he deemed it near,    His heart more truly knew that peal too well    Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,    And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:  He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.    Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,    And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,    And cheeks all pale which but an hour ago    Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;    And there were sudden partings, such as press    The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs    Which ne'er might be repeated: who would guess    If evermore should meet those mutual eyes  Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!    And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,    The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,    Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,    And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;    And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;    And near, the beat of the alarming drum    Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;    While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,  Or whispering with white lips,--"The foe! they come! they come!"    And wild and high the "Cameron's gathering" rose,    The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills    Have heard,--and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:    How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills    Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills    Their mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineers    With the fierce native daring which instills    The stirring memory of a thousand years,  And Evan's, Donald's fame, rings in each clansman's ears!    And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,    Dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass,    Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,    Over the unreturning brave,--alas!    Ere evening to be trodden like the grass    Which now beneath them, but above shall grow    In its next verdure, when this fiery mass    Of living valor, rolling on the foe,  And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.    Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,    Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,    The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,    The morn the marshalling in arms,--the day    Battle's magnificently stern array!    The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent    The earth is covered thick with other clay,    Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,  Rider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent!    Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;    Yet one I would select from that proud throng,    Partly because they blend me with his line,    And partly that I did his sire some wrong,    And partly that bright names will hallow song!    And his was of the bravest, and when showered    The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,    Even where the thickest of war's tempest lowered,  They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!    There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,    And mine were nothing, had I such to give;    But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,    Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,    And saw around me the wide field revive    With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring    Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,    With all her reckless birds upon the wing,  I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.    I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each    And one as all a ghastly gap did make    In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach    Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;    The Archangel's trump, not glory's, must awake    Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame    May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake    The fever of vain longing, and the name  So honored but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.    They mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:    The tree will wither long before it fall;    The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;    The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall    In massy hoariness; the ruined wall    Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;    The bars survive the captive they enthrall;    The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;  And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on;    Even as a broken mirror, which the glass    In every fragment multiplies, and makes    A thousand images of one that was    The same, and still the more, the more it breaks;    And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,    Living in shattered guise, and still, and cold,    And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,    Yet withers on till all without is old,  Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.LORD BYRON.       *       *       *       *       *BY THE ALMA RIVER.[September 20, 1854,]  Willie, fold your little hands;    Let it drop,--that "soldier" toy;  Look where father's picture stands,--    Father, that here kissed his boy  Not a mouth since,--father kind,  Who this night may (never mind  Mother's sob, my Willie dear)  Cry out loud that He may hear  Who is God of battles,--cry,  "God keep father safe this day      By the Alma River!"  Ask no more, child. Never heed    Either Russ, or Frank, or Turk;  Right of nations, trampled creed,    Chance-poised victory's bloody work;  Any flag i' the wind may roll  On thy heights, Sevastopol!  Willie, all to you and me  Is that spot, whate'er it be,  Where he stands--no other word--  _Stands_--God sure the child's prayers heard--      Near the Alma River.  Willie, listen to the bells    Ringing in the town to-day;  That's for victory. No knell swells    For the many swept away,--  Hundreds, thousands. Let us weep,  We, who need not,--just to keep  Reason clear in thought and brain  Till the morning comes again;  Till the third dread morning tell  Who they were that fought and--_fell_      By the Alma River.  Come, we'll lay us down, my child;    Poor the bed is,--poor and hard;  But thy father, far exiled,    Sleeps upon the open sward,  Dreaming of us two at home;  Or, beneath the starry dome,  Digs out trenches in the dark,  Where he buries--Willie, mark!--  Where _he buries_ those who died  Fighting--fighting at his side--      By the Alma River.  Willie, Willie, go to sleep;    God will help us, O my boy!  He will make the dull hours creep    Faster, and send news of joy;  When I need not shrink to meet  Those great placards in the street,  That for weeks will ghastly stare  In some eyes--child, say that prayer  Once again,--a different one,--  Say, "O God! Thy will be done      By the Alma River."DINAH MARIA MULOCK CRAIK.       *       *       *       *       *CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.[October 25, 1854.]  Half a league, half a league,    Half a league onward.  All in the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred.  "Forward, the Light Brigade!  Charge for the guns!" he said;  Into the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred.  "Forward, the Light Brigade!"  Was there a man dismayed?  Not though the soldier knew    Some one had blundered:  Theirs not to make reply,  Theirs not to reason why.  Theirs but to do and die:  Into the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred.  Cannon to right of them,  Cannon to left of them,  Cannon in front of them    Volleyed and thundered;  Stormed at with shot and shell,  Boldly they rode and well;  Into the jaws of Death,  Into the mouth of Hell,    Rode the six hundred.  Flashed all their sabres bare,  Flashed as they turned in air,  Sabring the gunners there,  Charging an army, while    All the world wondered:  Plunged in the battery-smoke,  Right through the line they broke:  Cossack and Russian  Reeled from the sabre-stroke,    Shattered and sundered.  Then they rode back, but not--    Not the six hundred.  Cannon to right of them,  Cannon to left of them,  Cannon behind them    Volleyed and thundered:  Stormed at with shot and shell,  While horse and hero fell,  They that had fought so well  Came through the jaws of Death  Back from the mouth of Hell,--  All that was left of them,    Left of six hundred.  When can their glory fade?  O the wild charge they made!    All the world wondered.  Honor the charge they made!  Honor the Light Brigade,    Noble six hundred!ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON.       *       *       *       *       *THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.[September 25, 1857.]  O, that last day in Lucknow fort!    We knew that it was the last;  That the enemy's lines crept surely on.    And the end was coming fast.  To yield to that foe meant worse than death;    And the men and we all worked on;  It was one day more of smoke and roar,    And then it would all be done.  There was one of us, a corporal's wife,    A fair, young, gentle thing,  Wasted with fever in the siege.    And her mind was wandering.  She lay on the ground, in her Scottish plaid,    And I took her head on my knee;  "When my father comes hame frae the pleugh," she said,    "Oh! then please wauken me."  She slept like a child on her father's floor,    In the flecking of woodbine-shade,  When the house-dog sprawls by the open door,    And the mother's wheel is stayed.  It was smoke and roar and powder-stench,    And hopeless waiting for death;  And the soldier's wife, like a full-tired child,    Seemed scarce to draw her breath.  I sank to sleep; and I had my dream    Of an English village-lane.  And wall and garden;--but one wild scream    Brought me back to the roar again.  There Jessie Brown stood listening    Till a sudden gladness broke  All over her face; and she caught my hand    And drew me near as she spoke:--  "The Hielanders! O, dinna ye hear    The slogan far awa,  The McGregor's?--O, I ken it weel;    It's the grandest o' them a'!  "God bless thae bonny Hielanders!    We're saved! we're saved!" she cried;  And fell on her knees; and thanks to God    Flowed forth like a full flood-tide.  Along the battery-line her cry    Had fallen among the men,  And they started back;--they were there to die;    But was life so near them, then?  They listened for life; the rattling fire    Far off, and the far-off roar,  Were all; and the colonel shook his head,    And they turned to their guns once more.  But Jessie said, "The slogan's done;    But winna ye hear it noo,  _The Campbells are comin'_? It's no' a dream;    Our succors hae broken through!"  We heard the roar and the rattle afar,    But the pipes we could not hear;  So the men plied their work of hopeless war    And knew that the end was near.  It was not long ere it made its way,--    A thrilling, ceaseless sound:  It was no noise from the strife afar,    Or the sappers under ground.  It _was_ the pipes of the Highlanders!    And now they played _Auld Lang Syne;_  It came to our men like the voice of God,    And they shouted along the line.  And they wept, and shook one another's hands,    And the women sobbed in a crowd;  And every one knelt down where he stood,    And we all thanked God aloud.  That happy day, when we welcomed them,    Our men put Jessie first;  And the general gave her his hand, and cheers    Like a storm from the soldiers burst.  And the pipers' ribbons and tartan streamed,    Marching round and round our line;  And our joyful cheers were broken with tears,    As the pipes played _Auld Long Syne_.ROBERT T.S.

And cheerless was that resting-place    For him who claimed a throne:  His canopy, devoid of grace,    The rude, rough beams alone;  The heather couch his only bed,--  Yet well I ween had slumber fled    From couch of eider-down!  Through darksome night till dawn of day,  Absorbed in wakeful thoughts he lay    Of Scotland and her crown.  The sun rose brightly, and its gleam    Fell on that hapless bed,  And tinged with light each shapeless beam    Which roofed the lowly shed;  When, looking up with wistful eye,  The Bruce beheld a spider try    His filmy thread to fling  From beam to beam of that rude cot;  And well the insect's toilsome lot    Taught Scotland's future king.  Six times his gossamery thread    The wary spider threw;  In vain the filmy line was sped,    For powerless or untrue  Each aim appeared, and back recoiled  The patient insect, six times foiled,    And yet unconquered still;  And soon the Bruce, with eager eye,  Saw him prepare once more to try    His courage, strength, and skill.  One effort more, his seventh and last--    The hero hailed the sign!--  And on the wished-for beam hung fast    That slender, silken line!  Slight as it was, his spirit caught  The more than omen, for his thought    The lesson well could trace,  Which even "he who runs may read,"  That Perseverance gains its meed,    And Patience wins the race.BERNARD BARTON.       *       *       *       *       *BANNOCKBURN.[June 24, 1314.]  Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled,  Scots, wham Bruce has aften led;  Welcome to your gory bed,     Or to victorie.

Loud a hundred clansmen raise    Their voices in their chieftain's praise.    Each boatman, bending to his oar,    With measured sweep the burthen bore,    In such wild cadence, as the breeze    Makes through December's leafless trees.    The chorus first could Allen know,    "Roderigh Vich Alpine, ho! ieroe!"    And near, and nearer, as they rowed,    Distinct the martial ditty flowed.  Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances!    Honored and blessed be the evergreen Pine!  Long may the tree, in his banner that glances,    Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line!        Heaven send it happy dew,        Earth lend it sap anew,    Gayly to bourgeon, and broadly to grow,        While every Highland glen        Sends our shouts back again,    "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!"  Ours is no sapling chance-sown by the fountain.    Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade;  When the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain,    The more shall Clan-Alpine exult in her shade.        Moored in the rifted rock,        Proof to the tempest's shock,    Firmer he roots him the ruder it blow;        Menteith and Breadalbane, then,        Echo his praise again,    "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!"  Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen Fruin,    And Bannachar's groans to our slogan replied;  Glen Luss and Ross-dhu, they are smoking in ruin,    And the best of Loch-Lomond lie dead on her side.        Widow and Saxon maid        Long shall lament our raid,    Think of Clan-Alpine with fear and with woe;        Lennox and Leven-glen        Shake when they hear again,    "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!"  Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands!    Stretch to your oars for the evergreen Pine!  O that the rosebud that graces yon islands    Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!        O that some seedling gem,        Worthy such noble stem,  Honored and blessed in their shadow might grow!        Loud should Clan-Alpine then        Ring from the deepmost glen,    "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!"SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *BEAL' AN DHUINE.[1411.]FROM "THE LADY OF THE LAKE," CANTO VI.  There is no breeze upon the fern,    No ripple on the lake,  Upon her eyrie nods the erne,    The deer has sought the brake;  The small birds will not sing aloud,    The springing trout lies still,  So darkly glooms yon thunder-cloud,  That swathes, as with a purple shroud,    Benledi's distant hill.  Is it the thunder's solemn sound    That mutters deep and dread,  Or echoes from the groaning ground    The warrior's measured tread?  Is it the lightning's quivering glance    That on the thicket streams,  Or do they flash on spear and lance    The sun's retiring beams?  I see the dagger crest of Mar,    I see the Moray's silver star  Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,    That up the lake comes winding far!  To hero bound for battle strife,    Or bard of martial lay,  'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,    One glance at their array!  Their light-armed archers far and near    Surveyed the tangled ground,  Their centre ranks, with pike and spear,    A twilight forest frowned,  Their barbed horsemen, in the rear,    The stern battalia crowned.  No cymbal clashed, no clarion rang,    Still were the pipe and drum;  Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,    The sullen march was dumb.  There breathed no wind their crests to shake,    Or wave their flags abroad;  Scarce the frail aspen seemed to quake,    That shadowed o'er their road.  Their vaward scouts no tidings bring,    Can rouse no lurking foe,  Nor spy a trace of living thing,    Save when they stirred the roe;  The host moves like a deep sea wave,  Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,    High swelling, dark, and slow.  The lake is passed, and now they gain  A narrow and a broken plain,  Before the Trosach's rugged jaws;  And here the horse and spearmen pause,  While, to explore the dangerous glen,  Dive through the pass the archer men.  At once there rose so wild a yell  Within that dark and narrow dell.  As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,  Had pealed the banner cry of hell!  Forth from the pass in tumult driven,  Like chaff before the winds of heaven,    The archery appear:  For life! for life! their flight they ply--  And shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,  And plaids and bonnets waving high,  And broadswords flashing to the sky,    Are maddening in the rear.  Onward they drive, in dreadful race,    Pursuers and pursued;  Before that tide of flight and chase,  How shall it keep its rooted place,    The spearmen's twilight wood?  --"Down, down," cried Mar, "your lances down!    Bear back both friend and foe!"  Like reeds before the tempest's frown,  That serried grove of lances brown    At once lay levelled low;  And closely shouldering side to side,  The bristling ranks the onset bide.--  --"We'll quell the savage mountaineer,    As their Tinchel[A] cows the game;  They come as fleet as forest deer,    We'll drive them back as tame."  Bearing before them, in their course,  The relics of the archer force,  Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,  Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.  Above the tide, each broadsword bright  Was brandishing like beam of light,    Each targe was dark below;  And with the ocean's mighty swing,  When heaving to the tempest's wing,    They hurled them on the foe.  I heard the lance's shivering crash,  As when the whirlwind rends the ash;  I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,  As if a hundred anvils rang!  But Moray wheeled his rearward flank--  Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank--    "My bannerman, advance!  I see," he cried, "their columns shake.  Now, gallants! for your ladies' sake,    Upon them with the lance!"  The horsemen dashed among the rout,    As deer break through the broom;  Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,    They soon make lightsome room.  Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--    Where, where was Roderick then?  One blast upon his bugle-horn    Were worth a thousand men!  And refluent through the pass of fear    The battle's tide was poured;  Vanished the Saxon's struggling spear,    Vanished the mountain sword.  As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,    Receives her roaring linn,  As the dark caverns of the deep    Suck the wild whirlpool in,  So did the deep and darksome pass  Devour the battle's mingled mass;  None linger now upon the plain,  Save those who ne'er shall fight again.[Footnote A: A circle of sportsmen, surrounding the deer.]SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *PIBROCH OF DONUIL DHU.[A][Footnote A: Pipe-summons, or gathering-song, of Donald the Black.][1481.]  Pibroch of Donuil Dhu,    Pibroch of Donuil,  Wake thy wild voice anew,    Summon Clan Conuil.

A moment then Lord Marmion stayed,  And breathed his steed, his men arrayed,    Then forward moved his band,  Until, Lord Surrey's rear-guard won,  He halted by a cross of stone,  That, on a hillock standing lone,    Did all the field command.  Hence might they see the full array  Of either host for deadly fray;  Their marshalled lines stretched east and west,    And fronted north and south,  And distant salutation past    From the loud cannon-mouth;  Not in the close successive rattle  That breathes the voice of modern battle,    But slow and far between.--  The hillock gained, Lord Marmion stayed:  "Here, by this cross," he gently said,    "You well may view the scene;  Here shalt thou tarry, lovely Clare:  O, think of Marmion in thy prayer!--  Thou wilt not?--well,--no less my care  Shall, watchful, for thy weal prepare.--  You, Blount and Eustace, are her guard,    With ten picked archers of my train;  With England if the day go hard,    To Berwick speed amain,--  But, if we conquer, cruel maid,  My spoils shall at your feet be laid,    When here we meet again."  He waited not for answer there,  And would not mark the maid's despair,    Nor heed the discontented look  From either squire: but spurred amain,  And, dashing through the battle-plain,    His way to Surrey took.       *       *       *       *       *  Blount and Fitz-Eustace rested still  With Lady Clare upon the hill;  On which (for far the day was spent)  The western sunbeams now were bent.  The cry they heard, its meaning knew,  Could plain their distant comrades view:  Sadly to Blount did Eustace say,  "Unworthy office here to stay!  No hope of gilded spurs to-day.--  But, see! look up,--on Flodden bent  The Scottish foe has fired his tent."--    And sudden, as he spoke,  From the sharp ridges of the hill,  All downward to the banks of Till    Was wreathed in sable smoke.  Volumed and vast, and rolling far,  The cloud enveloped Scotland's war,    As down the hill they broke;  Nor martial shout, nor minstrel tone,  Announced their march; their tread alone,  At times their warning trumpet blown,    At times a stifled hum,  Told England, from his mountain-throne    King James did rushing come.--  Scarce could they hear or see their foes,  Until at weapon-point they close.--  They close in clouds of smoke and dust,  With sword-sway and with lance's thrust;    And such a yell was there,  Of sudden and portentous birth,  As if men fought upon the earth   And fiends in upper air:  O, life and death were in the shout,  Recoil and rally, charge and rout,    And triumph and despair.  Long looked the anxious squires; their eye  Could in the darkness naught descry.  At length the freshening western blast  Aside the shroud of battle cast;  And, first, the ridge of mingled spears  Above the brightened cloud appears;  And in the smoke the pennons flew,  As in the storm the white sea-mew.  Then marked they, dashing broad and far,  The broken billows of the war,  And plumed crests of chieftains brave  Floating like foam upon the wave;    But naught distinct they see:  Wide raged the battle on the plain;  Spears shook, and falchions flashed amain;  Fell England's arrow-flight like rain;  Crests rose, and stooped, and rose again,    Wild and disorderly.  Amid the scene of tumult, high  They saw Lord Marmion's falcon fly:  And stainless Tunstall's banner white,  And Edmund Howard's lion bright,  Still bear them bravely in the fight;    Although against them come  Of gallant Gordons many a one,  And many a stubborn Highlandman,  And many a rugged Border clan,    With Huntley and with Home.  Far on the left, unseen the while,  Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle;  Though there the western mountaineer  Rushed with bare bosom on the spear,  And flung the feeble targe aside,  And with both hands the broadsword plied,  'Twas vain:--But Fortune, on the right,  With fickle smile, cheered Scotland's fight.  Then fell that spotless banner white,    The Howard's lion fell;  Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew  With wavering flight, while fiercer grew    Around the battle-yell.  The Border slogan rent the sky!  A Home! a Gordon! was the cry:  Loud were the clanging blows;  Advanced,--forced back,--now low, now high,    The pennon sunk and rose;  As bends the bark's mast in the gale,  When rent are rigging, shrouds, and sail,    It wavered mid the foes.  No longer Blount the view could bear:--  "By heaven and all its saints, I swear,    I will not see it lost!  Fitz-Eustace, you with Lady Clare  May bid your beads, and patter prayer,--    I gallop to the host."  And to the fray he rode amain,  Followed by all the archer train.  The fiery youth, with desperate charge,  Made, for a space, an opening large,    The rescued banner rose.  But darkly closed the war around.  Like pine-tree rooted from the ground.    It sunk among the foes.  Then Eustace mounted too;--yet stayed,  As loath to leave the helpless maid,    When, fast as shaft can fly,  Bloodshot his eyes, his nostrils spread,  The loose rein dangling from his head,  Housing and saddle bloody red,    Lord Marmion's steed rushed by;  And Eustace, maddening at the sight,    A look and sign to Clara cast,    To mark he would return in haste,  Then plunged into the fight.  Ask me not what the maiden feels,    Left in that dreadful hour alone:  Perchance her reason stoops or reels;    Perchance a courage, not her own,    Braces her mind to desperate tone.--  The scattered van of England wheels;--    She only said, as loud in air;    The tumult roared, "Is Wilton there?"    They fly, or, maddened by despair,    Fight but to die,--"Is Wilton there?"  With that, straight up the hill there rode;    Two horsemen drenched with gore,  And in their arms, a helpless load,    A wounded knight they bore.  His hand still strained the broken brand;  His arms were smeared with blood and sand.  Dragged from among the horses' feet,  With dinted shield, and helmet beat,  The falcon-crest and plumage gone,  Can that be haughty Marmion!...  Young Blount his armor did unlace,  And, gazing on his ghastly face,    Said,--"By Saint George, he's gone!  That spear-wound has our master sped,--  And see the deep cut on his head!    Good night to Marmion."--  "Unnurtured Blount! thy brawling cease:  He opes his eyes," said Eustace; "peace!"  When, doffed his casque, he felt free air,  Around 'gan Marmion wildly stare:--  "Where's Harry Blount? Fitz-Eustace where?  Linger ye here, ye hearts of hare!  Redeem my pennon,--charge again!  Cry--'Marmion to the rescue!'--vain!  Last of my race, on battle-plain  That shout shall ne'er be heard again!--  Yet my last thought is England's:--fly,    To Dacre bear my signet-ring:    Tell him his squadrons up to bring:--  Fitz-Eustace, to Lord Surrey hie;    Tunstall lies dead upon the field,    His life-blood stains the spotless shield:    Edmund is down;--my life is reft;--    The Admiral alone is left.    Let Stanley charge with spur of fire,--    With Chester charge, and Lancashire,    Full upon Scotland's central host,    Or victory and England's lost.--    Must I bid twice?--hence, varlets! fly!    Leave Marmion here alone--to die."    They parted, and alone he lay:    Clare drew her from the sight away,  Till pain rung forth a lowly moan,  And half he murmured,--"Is there none,    Of all my halls have nurst.  Page, squire, or groom, one cup to bring,  Of blessed water from the spring,  To slake my dying thirst?"  O woman! in our hours of ease,  Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,  And variable as the shade  By the light quivering aspen made;  When pain and anguish wring the brow,  A ministering angel thou!--  Scarce were the piteous accents said,  When, with the Baron's casque, the maid    To the nigh streamlet ran;  Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fears;  The plaintive voice alone she hears,    Sees but the dying man.  She stooped her by the runnel's side,    But in abhorrence backward drew;  For, oozing from the mountain's side,  Where raged the war, a dark-red tide    Was curdling in the streamlet blue,  Where shall she turn!--behold her mark    A little fountain cell,  Where water, clear as diamond-spark,    In a stone basin fell.  Above, some half-worn letters say,  Drink : weary : pilgrim : drink : and : pray :  for : the : kind : soul : of : Sybil : Gray :    Who : built : this : cross : and : well :  She filled the helm, and back she hied,  And with surprise and joy espied    A monk supporting Marmion's head;  A pious man whom duty brought  To dubious verge of battle fought,    To shrive the dying, bless the dead.  Deep drank Lord Marmion of the wave,  And, as she stooped his brow to lave,--  "Is it the hand of Clare," he said,  "Or injured Constance, bathes my head?"    Then, as remembrance rose,--  "Speak not to me of shrift or prayer!    I must redress her woes.  Short space, few words, are mine to spare;  Forgive and listen, gentle Clare!"--    "Alas!" she said, "the while.--  O, think of your immortal weal!  In vain for Constance is your zeal;    She--died at Holy Isle."--  Lord Marmion started from the ground,  As light as if he felt no wound;  Though in the action burst the tide  In torrents from his wounded side.  "Then it was truth!" he said,--"I knew  That the dark presage must be true.--  I would the Fiend, to whom belongs  The vengeance due to all her wrongs,    Would spare me but a day!  For wasting fire, and dying groan,  And priests slain on the altar stone,    Might bribe him for delay.  It may not be!--this dizzy trance,--  Curse on yon base marauder's lance,  And doubly cursed my failing brand!  A sinful heart makes feeble hand."  Then, fainting, down on earth he sunk,  Supported by the trembling monk.  With fruitless labor, Clara bound,  And strove to stanch the gushing wound:  The monk, with unavailing cares,  Exhausted all the Church's prayers.  Ever, he said, that, close and near,  A lady's voice was in his ear,  And that the priest he could not hear,    For that she ever sung,  "_In the lost battle, borne down by the flying,  Where mingles war's rattle with groans of the       dying!_"    So the notes rung:--  "Avoid thee, Fiend!--with cruel hand,  Shake not the dying sinner's sand!--  O, look, my son, upon yon sign  Of the Redeemer's grace divine:    O, think on faith and bliss!--  By many a death-bed I have been,  And many a sinner's parting seen,    But never aught like this."  The war, that for a space did fail,  Now trebly thundering swelled the gale,    And STANLEY! was the cry:--  A light on Marmion's visage spread,    And fired his glazing eye:  With dying hand above his head  He shook the fragment of his blade,    And shouted "Victory!--  Charge, Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!"  Were the last words of Marmion.SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *THE BONNETS OF BONNIE DUNDEE.[About 1688.]  To the lords of convention 'twas Claverhouse spoke,  "Ere the king's crown shall fall, there are crowns to be broke;  So let each cavalier who loves honor and me  Come follow the bonnets of bonnie Dundee!"  _Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can;  Come saddle your horses, and call up your men;  Come open the Westport and let us gang free,  And it's room for the bonnets of bonnie Dundee_!  Dundee he is mounted, he rides up the street,  The bells are rung backward, the drums they are beat;  But the provost, douce man, said, "Just e'en let him be,  The gude toun is well quit of that deil of Dundee!"  As he rode doun the sanctified bends of the Bow,  Ilk carline was flyting and shaking her pow;  But the young plants of grace they looked cowthie and slee,  Thinking, Luck to thy bonnet, thou bonnie Dundee!  With sour-featured whigs the Grass-market was thranged,  As if half the west had set tryst to be hanged;  There was spite in each look, there was fear in each ee,  As they watched for the bonnets of bonnie Dundee.  These cowls of Kilmarnock had spits and had spears,  And lang-hafted gullies to kill cavaliers;  But they shrunk to close-heads, and the causeway was free  At the toss of the bonnet of bonnie Dundee.  He spurred to the foot of the proud castle rock,  And with the gay Gordon he gallantly spoke:  "Let Mons Meg and her marrows speak twa words or three,  For the love of the bonnet of bonnie Dundee."  The Gordon demands of him which way he goes.  "Where'er shall direct me the shade of Montrose!  Your grace in short space shall hear tidings of me,  Or that low lies the bonnet of bonnie Dundee.  "There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth;  If there's lords in the Lowlands, there's chiefs in the north;  There are wild Duniewassals three thousand times three  Will cry 'Hoigh!' for the bonnet of bonnie Dundee.  "There's brass on the target of barkened bull-hide,  There's steel in the scabbard that dangles beside;  The brass shall be burnished, the steel shall flash free,  At a toss of the bonnet of bonnie Dundee.  "Away to the hills, to the caves, to the rocks,  Ere I own an usurper I'll couch with the fox;  And tremble, false whigs, in the midst of your glee,  You have not seen the last of my bonnet and me."  He waved his proud hand, and the trumpets were blown,  The kettle-drums clashed, and the horsemen rode on,  Till on Ravelston's cliffs and on Clermiston's lea  Died away the wild war-notes of bonnie Dundee.  _Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can;  Come saddle the horses, and call up the men;  Come open your doors and let me gae free,  For it's up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee_!SIR WALTER SCOTT.       *       *       *       *       *LIBERTY TREE.[1775.]  In a chariot of light from the regions of day,    The Goddess of Liberty came;  Ten thousand celestials directed the way,    And hither conducted the dame.  A fair budding branch from the gardens above,    Where millions with millions agree,  She brought in her hand as a pledge of her love,    And the plant she named _Liberty Tree_.  The celestial exotic struck deep in the ground,    Like a native it flourished and bore;  The fame of its fruit drew the nations around,    To seek out this peaceable shore.  Unmindful of names or distinction they came,    For freemen like brothers agree;  With one spirit endued, they one friendship pursued,    And their temple was _Liberty Tree_.  Beneath this fair tree, like the patriarchs of old,    Their bread in contentment they ate,  Unvexed with the troubles of silver and gold,    The cares of the grand and the great.  With timber and tar they Old England supplied,    And supported her power on the sea;  Her battles they fought, without getting a groat,    For the honor of _Liberty Tree_.  But hear, O ye swains, 'tis a tale most profane,    How all the tyrannical powers,  Kings, Commons, and Lords, are united amain.

The foe long since in silence slept;    Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;  And Time the ruined bridge has swept    Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.  On this green bank, by this soft stream,    We set to-day a votive stone;  That memory may their deed redeem,    When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

By starlight and moonlight,    He seeks the Briton's camp;  He hears the rustling flag,    And the armed sentry's tramp;  And the starlight and moonlight    His silent wanderings lamp.  With slow tread and still tread,    He scans the tented line;  And he counts the battery guns    By the gaunt and shadowy pine;  And his slow tread and still tread    Gives no warning sign.  The dark wave, the plumed wave,    It meets his eager glance;  And it sparkles 'neath the stars,    Like the glimmer of a lance--  A dark wave, a plumed wave,    On an emerald expanse.  A sharp clang, a steel clang,    And terror in the sound!  For the sentry, falcon-eyed,    In the camp a spy hath found;  With a sharp clang, a steel clang,    The patriot is bound.  With calm brow, steady brow,    He listens to his doom;  In his look there is no fear,    Nor a shadow-trace of gloom;  But with calm brow and steady brow    He robes him for the tomb.  In the long night, the still night,    He kneels upon the sod;  And the brutal guards withhold    E'en the solemn Word of God!  In the long night, the still night,    He walks where Christ hath trod.  'Neath the blue morn, the sunny morn,    He dies upon the tree;  And he mourns that he can lose    But one life for Liberty;  And in the blue morn, the sunny morn,    His spirit-wings are free.  But his last words, his message-words,    They burn, lest friendly eye  Should read how proud and calm    A patriot could die,  With his last words, his dying words,    A soldier's battle-cry.  From Fame-leaf and Angel-leaf,    From monument and urn,  The sad of earth, the glad of heaven,    His tragic fate shall learn;  And on Fame-leaf and Angel-leaf    The name of HALE shall burn!FRANCIS MILES FINCH.       *       *       *       *       *SONG OF MARION'S MEN.[A][Footnote A: General Francis Marion, of South Carolina, renowned as adaring patriot partisan leader during the Revolutionary War.]  Our band is few, but true and tried,    Our leader frank and bold;  The British soldier trembles    When Marion's name is told.  Our fortress is the good greenwood,    Our tent the cypress-tree;  We know the forest round us,    As seamen know the sea;  We know its walls of thorny vines,    Its glades of reedy grass,  Its safe and silent islands    Within the dark morass.  Woe to the English soldiery    That little dread us near!  On them shall light at midnight    A strange and sudden fear;  When, waking to their tents on fire,    They grasp their arms in vain,  And they who stand to face us    Are beat to earth again;  And they who fly in terror deem    A mighty host behind,  And hear the tramp of thousands    Upon the hollow wind.  Then sweet the hour that brings release    From danger and from toil;  We talk the battle over,    And share the battle's spoil.  The woodland rings with laugh and shout,    As if a hunt were up,  And woodland flowers are gathered    To crown the soldier's cup.  With merry songs we mock the wind    That in the pine-top grieves,  And slumber long and sweetly    On beds of oaken leaves.  Well knows the fair and friendly moon    The band that Marion leads,--  The glitter of their rifles,    The scampering of their steeds.  'Tis life to guide the fiery barb    Across the moonlight plain;  'Tis life to feel the night-wind    That lifts his tossing mane.  A moment in the British camp--    A moment--and away  Back to the pathless forest,    Before the peep of day.  Grave men there are by broad Santee,    Grave men with hoary hairs;  Their hearts are all with Marion,    For Marion are their prayers.  And lovely ladies greet our band    With kindliest welcoming,  With smiles like those of summer,    And tears like those of spring.  For them we wear these trusty arms,    And lay them down no more  Till we have driven the Briton    Forever from our shore.WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.       *       *       *       *       *CARMEN BELLICOSUM.  In their ragged regimentals  Stood the old Continentals,      Yielding not.  When the grenadiers were lunging,  And like hail fell the plunging      Cannon-shot;      When the files      Of the isles,  From the smoky night encampment, bore the banner of the rampant      Unicorn,  And grummer, grummer, grummer rolled the roll of the drummer,      Through the morn!    Then with eyes to the front all,    And with guns horizontal,      Stood our sires;    And the balls whistled deadly,    And in streams flashing redly      Blazed the fires;      As the roar      On the shore,  Swept the strong battle-breakers o'er the green-sodded acres      Of the plain;  And louder, louder, louder, cracked the black gun-powder,      Cracking amain!    Now like smiths at their forges    Worked the red St. George's      Cannoneers;    And the "villanous saltpetre"    Rung a fierce, discordant metre      Round their ears;      As the swift      Storm-drift,  With hot sweeping anger, came the horseguards' clangor      On our flanks;  Then higher, higher, higher, burned the old fashioned fire      Through the ranks!    Then the bare-headed colonel    Galloped through the white infernal      Powder-cloud;    And his broad sword was swinging    And his brazen throat was ringing      Trumpet-loud.      Then the blue      Bullets flew,  And the trooper-jackets redden at the touch of the leaden      Rifle-breath;  And rounder, rounder, rounder, roared the iron six-pounder,      Hurling death!GUY HUMPHREY M'MASTER.       *       *       *       *       *THE DANCE.[Published soon after the surrender of Cornwallis.]  Cornwallis led a country dance,    The like was never seen, sir,  Much retrogade and much advance,    And all with General Greene, sir.

And got a mighty name, sir,  Cornwallis jigged with young Fayette,    But suffered in his fame, sir.  Then down he figured to the shore,    Most like a lordly dancer,  And on his courtly honor swore    He would no more advance, sir.

Yet are red heels and long-laced skirts,    For stumps and briars meet, sir?  Or stand they chance with hunting-shirts,    Or hardy veteran feet, sir?  Now housed in York, he challenged all,    At minuet or all 'amande,  And lessons for a courtly ball    His guards by day and night conned.

Now here, now there, the shot it hailed    In deadly drifts of fiery spray,  Yet not a single soldier quailed  When wounded comrades round them wailed    Their dying shouts at Monterey.  And on, still on our column kept,    Through walls of flame its withering way;  Where fell the dead, the living stept,  Still charging on the guns which swept    The slippery streets of Monterey.  The foe himself recoiled aghast,    When striking where he strongest lay,  We swooped his flanking batteries past,  And, braving full their murderous blast,    Stormed home the towers of Monterey.  Our banners on those turrets wave,    And there our evening bugles play;  Where orange boughs above their grave,  Keep green the memory of the brave    Who fought and fell at Monterey.  We are not many,--we who pressed    Beside the brave who fell that day;  But who of us has not confessed  He'd rather share their warrior rest    Than not have been at Monterey?CHARLES FENNO HOFFMAN.       *       *       *       *       *COMING.[April, 1861.]  World, art thou 'ware of a storm?

O keeper of the Sacred Key,    And the Great Seal of Destiny.    Whose eye is the blue canopy.  Look down upon the warring world, and tell us what the end will be.    "Lo, through the wintry atmosphere.    On the white bosom of the sphere,    A cluster of five lakes appear;  And all the land looks like a couch, or warrior's shield, or sheeted          bier.    "And on that vast and hollow field,    With both lips closed and both eyes sealed,    A mighty Figure is revealed,--  Stretched at full length, and stiff and stark, as in the hollow of a          shield.    "The winds have tied the drifted snow    Around the face and chin; and lo,    The sceptred Giants come and go,  And shake their shadowy crowns and say: 'We always feared it would          be so!'    "She came of an heroic race:    A giant's strength, a maiden's grace,    Like two in one seem to embrace,  And match, and bend, and thorough-blend, in her colossal form and face.    "Where can her dazzling falchion be?    One hand is fallen in the sea;    The Gulf Stream drifts it far and free;  And in that hand her shining brand gleams from the depths resplendently.    "And by the other, in its rest,    The starry banner of the West    Is clasped forever to her breast;  And of her silver helmet, lo, a soaring eagle is the crest.    "And on her brow, a softened light,    As of a star concealed from sight    By some thin veil of fleecy white,  Or of the rising moon behind the raining vapors of the night.    "The Sisterhood that was so sweet,    The Starry System sphered complete,    Which the mazed Orient used to greet,  The Four-and-Thirty fallen Stars glimmer and glitter at her feet.    "And over her,--and over all.    For panoply and coronal,--    The mighty Immemorial,  And everlasting Canopy and Starry Arch and Shield of All.  II.    "Three cold, bright moons have marched and wheeled;    And the white cerement that revealed    A Figure stretched upon a Shield,  Is turned to verdure; and the Land is now one mighty battle-field.    "And lo, the children which she bred,    And more than all else cherished,    To make them true in heart and head,  Stand face to face, as mortal foes, with their swords crossed above          the dead.    "Each hath a mighty stroke and stride:    One true,--the more that he is tried;    The other dark and evil-eyed;--  And by the hand of one of them, his own dear mother surely died!    "A stealthy step, a gleam of hell,--    It is the simple truth to tell,--    The Son stabbed and the Mother fell:  And so she lies, all mute and pale, and pure and irreproachable!    "And then the battle-trumpet blew;    And the true brother sprang and drew    His blade to smite the traitor through;  And so they clashed above the bier, and the Night sweated bloody dew.    "And all their children, far and wide,    That are so greatly multiplied,    Rise up in frenzy and divide;  And choosing, each whom he will serve, unsheathe the sword and take          their side.    "And in the low sun's bloodshot rays,    Portentous of the coming days,    The Two great Oceans blush and blaze,  With the emergent continent between them, wrapt in crimson haze.    "Now whichsoever stand or fall,    As God is great, and man is small,    The Truth shall triumph over all:  Forever and forevermore, the Truth shall triumph over all!  III.    "I see the champion sword-strokes flash;    I see them fall and hear them clash;    I hear the murderous engines crash;  I see a brother stoop to loose a foeman-brother's bloody sash.    "I see the torn and mangled corse,    The dead and dying heaped in scores,    The headless rider by his horse,  The wounded captive bayoneted through and through without remorse.    "I hear the dying sufferer cry,    With his crushed face turned to the sky,    I see him crawl in agony  To the foul pool, and bow his head into bloody slime, and die.    "I see the assassin crouch and fire,    I see his victim fall,--expire;    I see the murderer creeping nigher  To strip the dead. He turns the head,--the face! The son beholds his          sire!    "I hear the curses and the thanks;    I see the mad charge on the flanks,    The rents, the gaps, the broken ranks,  The vanquished squadrons driven headlong down the river's bridgeless          banks.    "I see the death-gripe on the plain,    The grappling monsters on the main,    The tens of thousands that are slain,  And all the speechless suffering and agony of heart and brain.    "I see the dark and bloody spots,    The crowded rooms and crowded cots,    The bleaching bones, the battle blots,--  And writ on many a nameless grave, a legend of forget-me-nots.    "I see the gorged prison-den,    The dead line and the pent-up pen,    The thousands quartered in the fen,  The living-deaths of skin and bone that were the goodly shapes of men.    "And still the bloody Dew must fall!    And His great Darkness with the Pall    Of His dread Judgment cover all,  Till the Dead Nation rise Transformed by Truth to triumph over all!"    "And Last--and Last I see--The Dead."

She has torn her own star from our firmament's glow,  And turned on her brother the face of a foe!  O Caroline, Caroline, child of the sun,  We can never forget that our hearts have been one,--  Our foreheads both sprinkled in Liberty's name,  From the fountain of blood with the finger of flame!  You were always too ready to fire at a touch;  But we said: "She is hasty--she does not mean much."  We have scowled when you uttered some turbulent threat;  But friendship still whispered: "Forgive and forget."  Has our love all died out? Have its altars grown cold?  Has the curse come at last which the fathers foretold?  Then Nature must teach us the strength of the chain  That her petulant children would sever in vain.  They may fight till the buzzards are gorged with their spoil,--  Till the harvest grows black as it rots in the soil,  Till the wolves and the catamounts troop from their caves,  And the shark tracks the pirate, the lord of the waves:  In vain is the strife! When its fury is past,  Their fortunes must flow in one channel at last,  As the torrents that rush from the mountains of snow  Roll mingled in peace in the valleys below.  Our Union is river, lake, ocean, and sky;  Man breaks not the medal when God cuts the die!  Though darkened with sulphur, though cloven with steel,  The blue arch will brighten, the waters will heal!  O Caroline, Caroline, child of the sun,  There are battles with fate that can never be won!  The star-flowering banner must never be furled,  For its blossoms of light are the hope of the world!  Go, then, our rash sister, afar and aloof,--  Run wild in the sunshine away from our roof;  But when your heart aches and your feet have grown sore,  Remember the pathway that leads to our door!OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.       *       *       *       *       *JONATHAN TO JOHN.

"All quiet along the Potomac," they say,    "Except now and then a stray picket  Is shot, as he walks on his beat, to and fro,    By a rifleman hid in the thicket.  'Tis nothing: a private or two, now and then,    Will not count in the news of the battle;  Not an officer lost,--only one of the men,    Moaning out, all alone, the death-rattle."  All quiet along the Potomac to-night,    Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;  Their tents in the rays of the clear autumn moon,    Or the light of the watch-fires, are gleaming.  A tremulous sigh, as the gentle night-wind    Through the forest leaves softly is creeping;  While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,    Keep guard,--for the army is sleeping.  There's only the sound of the lone sentry's tread    As he tramps from the rock to the fountain,  And he thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed,    Far away in the cot on the mountain.  His musket falls slack; his face, dark and grim,    Grows gentle with memories tender,  As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep,    For their mother,--may Heaven defend her!  The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then,    That night when the love yet unspoken  Leaped up to his lips,--when low, murmured vows    Were pledged to be ever unbroken;  Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,    He dashes off tears that are welling,  And gathers his gun closer up to its place,    As if to keep down the heart-swelling.  He passes the fountain, the blasted pine-tree,--    The footstep is lagging and weary;  Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light,    Toward the shades of the forest so dreary.  Hark! was it the night-wind that rustled the leaves?    Was it moonlight so wondrously flashing?  It looked like a rifle: "Ha! Mary, good-bye!"    And the life-blood is ebbing and plashing.  All quiet along the Potomac to-night,--    No sound save the rush of the river;  While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead,--  The picket's off duty forever.ETHELINDA ELLIOTT BEERS.       *       *       *       *       *THE COUNTERSIGN.  Alas the weary hours pass slow,    The night is very dark and still,  And in the marshes far below    I hear the bearded whippoorwill.  I scarce can see a yard ahead;    My ears are strained to catch each sound;  I hear the leaves about me shed,    And the spring's bubbling through the ground.  Along the beaten path I pace,    Where white rags mark my sentry's track;  In formless shrubs I seem to trace    The foeman's form, with bending back;  I think I see him crouching low--    I stop and list--I stoop and peer,  Until the neighboring hillocks grow    To groups of soldiers far and near.  With ready piece I wait and watch,    Until my eyes, familiar grown,  Detect each harmless earthen notch,    And turn guerrillas into stone;  And then amid the lonely gloom,    Beneath the tall old chestnut trees,  My silent marches I resume,    And think of other times than these.  "Halt! who goes there?" my challenge cry,    It rings along the watchful line;  "Relief!" I hear a voice reply--    "Advance, and give the countersign!"  With bayonet at the charge I wait--    The corporal gives the mystic spell;  With arms aport I charge my mate,    Then onward pass, and all is well.  But in the tent that night awake,    I ask, if in the fray I fall,  Can I the mystic answer make,    When the angelic sentries call?

"Ah, captain! here goes for a fine-drawn bead,    There's music around when my barrel's in tune!"  Crack! went the rifle, the messenger sped,    And dead from his horse fell the ringing dragoon.  "Now, rifleman, steal through the bushes, and snatch    From your victim some trinket to handsel first blood;  A button, a loop, or that luminous patch    That gleams in the moon like a diamond stud!"  "O captain! I staggered, and sunk on my track,    When I gazed on the face of that fallen vidette,  For he looked so like you, as he lay on his back,    That my heart rose upon me, and masters me yet.  "But I snatched off the trinket,--this locket of gold;    An inch from the centre my lead broke its way,  Scarce grazing the picture, so fair to behold,    Of a beautiful lady in bridal array."  "Ha! rifleman, fling me the locket!--'tis she,    My brother's young bride, and the fallen dragoon  Was her husband--Hush! soldier, 'twas Heaven's decree,    We must bury him there, by the light of the moon!

The colonel rode by his picket-line    In the pleasant morning sun,  That glanced from him far off to shine    On the crouching rebel picket's gun.  From his command the captain strode    Out with a grave salute,  And talked with the colonel as he rode:--    The picket levelled his piece to shoot.  The colonel rode and the captain walked,--    The arm of the picket tired;  Their faces almost touched as they talked,    And, swerved from his aim, the picket fired.  The captain fell at the horse's feet,    Wounded and hurt to death,  Calling upon a name that was sweet    As God is good, with his dying breath.  And the colonel that leaped from his horse and knelt    To close the eyes so dim,  A high remorse for God's mercy felt,    Knowing the shot was meant for him.  And he whispered, prayer-like, under his breath,    The name of his own young wife:  For Love, that had made his friend's peace with Death,    Alone could make his with life.WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS.       *       *       *       *       *THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE.[September, 1861;]  We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!

If you look across the hill-tops that meet the northern sky,  Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry;  And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloudy veil aside,  And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride,  And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour:  We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!  If you look all up our valleys where the growing harvests shine,  You may see our sturdy farmer boys fast forming into line;  And children from their mother's knees are pulling at the weeds,  And learning how to reap and sow against their country's needs;  And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door:  We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!  You have called us, and we're coming, by Richmond's bloody tide  To lay us down, for Freedom's sake, our brothers' bones beside,  Or from foul treason's savage grasp to wrench the murderous blade,  And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade.

Up from the meadows rich with corn,  Clear in the cool September morn.  The clustered spires of Frederick stand  Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.  Round about them orchards sweep.  Apple and peach trees fruited deep,  Fair as a garden of the Lord  To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,  On that pleasant morn of the early fall  When Lee marched over the mountain wall,--  Over the mountains, winding down,  Horse and foot into Frederick town.  Forty flags with their silver stars,  Forty flags with their crimson bars,  Flapped in the morning wind: the sun  Of noon looked down, and saw not one.  Tip rose old Barbara Frietchie then,  Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;  Bravest of all in Frederick town,  She took up the flag the men hauled down;  In her attic-window the staff she set,  To show that one heart was loyal yet.  Up the street came the rebel tread,  Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.  Under his slouched hat left and right  He glanced: the old flag met his sight.  "Halt!"--the dust-brown ranks stood fast;  "Fire!"--out blazed the rifle-blast.  It shivered the window, pane and sash;  It rent the banner with seam and gash.  Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff  Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;  She leaned far out on the window-sill,  And shook it forth with a royal will.  "Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,  But spare your country's flag," she said.  A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,  Over the face of the leader came;  The nobler nature within him stirred  To life at that woman's deed and word:  "Who touches a hair of yon gray head  Dies like a dog! March on!" he said.  All day long through Frederick street  Sounded the tread of marching feet;  All day long that free flag tost  Over the heads of the rebel host.  Ever its torn folds rose and fell  On the loyal winds that loved it well;  And through the hill-gaps sunset light  Shone over it with a warm good-night.  Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er.  And the rebel rides on his raids no more.  Honor to her! and let a tear  Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.  Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,  Flag of freedom and union, wave!  Peace and order and beauty draw  Round thy symbol of light and law;  And ever the stars above look down  On thy stars below in Frederick town!JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.       *       *       *       *       *CAVALRY SONG.FROM "ALICE OF MONMOUTH."

'Twas the day when with Jameson, fierce Berry, and Birney,    Against twenty thousand he rallied the field.  Where the red volleys poured, where the clamor rose highest,    Where the dead lay in clumps through the dwarf oak and pine,  Where the aim from the thicket was surest and nighest,--    No charge like Phil Kearny's along the whole line.  When the battle went ill, and the bravest were solemn,    Near the dark Seven Pines, where we still held our ground,  He rode down the length of the withering column,    And his heart at our war-cry leapt up with a bound;  He snuffed, like his charger, the wind of the powder,--    His sword waved us on and we answered the sign:  Loud our cheer as we rushed, but his laugh rang the louder,    "There's the devil's own fun, boys, along the whole line!"  How he strode his brown steed! How we saw his blade brighten    In the one hand still left,--and the reins in his teeth!  He laughed like a boy when the holidays heighten.    But a soldier's glance shot from his visor beneath.  Up came the reserves to the mellay infernal,    Asking where to go in,--through the clearing or pine?  "O, anywhere! Forward! 'Tis all the same, Colonel:    You'll find lovely fighting along the whole line!"  O, evil the black shroud of night at Chantilly,    That hid him from sight of his brave men and tried!  Foul, foul sped the bullet that clipped the white lily,    The flower of our knighthood, the whole army's pride!  Yet we dream that he still,--in that shadowy region    Where the dead form their ranks at the wan drummer's sign,--  Rides on, as of old, down the length of his legion,    And the word still is Forward! along the whole line.EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN.       *       *       *       *       *THE GENERAL'S DEATH.  The general dashed along the road    Amid the pelting rain;  How joyously his bold face glowed    To hear our cheers' refrain!  His blue blouse flapped in wind and wet,    His boots were splashed with mire,  But round his lips a smile was set,    And in his eyes a fire.  A laughing word, a gesture kind,--    We did not ask for more,  With thirty weary miles behind,    A weary fight before.  The gun grew light to every man,    The crossed belts ceased their stress,  As onward to the column's van    We watched our leader press.  Within an hour we saw him lie,    A bullet in his brain,  His manly face turned to the sky,    And beaten by the rain.JOSEPH O'CONNOR.       *       *       *       *       *DIRGE FOB A SOLDIER[A][Footnote A: Major-General Philip Kearny.]  Close his eyes; his work is done!

What to him are all our wars?--    What but death-bemocking folly?      Lay him low, lay him low,      In the clover or the snow!      What cares he? he cannot know;        Lay him low!  Leave him to God's watching eye;    Trust him to the hand that made him.  Mortal love weeps idly by;    God alone has power to aid him.

Just where Wade Hampton boomed away    The fight went neck and neck.  All day the weaker wing we held,    And held it with a will.  Five several stubborn times we charged    The battery on the hill,  And five times beaten back, re-formed,    And kept our column still.  At last from out the centre fight    Spurred up a general's aide:  "That battery must silenced be!"    He cried, as past he sped.  Our colonel simply touched his cap,    And then, with measured tread,  To lead the crouching line once more    The grand old fellow came.  No wounded man but raised his head    And strove to gasp his name,  And those who could not speak nor stir,    "God blessed him" just the same.  For he was all the world to us,    That hero gray and grim.  Right well we knew that fearful slope    We'd climb with none but him,  Though while his white head led the way    We'd charge hell's portals in.  This time we were not half-way up.    When, midst the storm of shell,  Our leader, with his sword upraised,    Beneath our bayonets fell.  And, as we bore him back, the foe    Set up a joyous yell.  Our hearts went with him. Back we swept,    And when the bugle said  "Up, charge again!" no man was there    But hung his dogged head.  "We've no one left to lead us now,"    The sullen soldiers said.  Just then before the laggard line    The colonel's horse we spied,  Bay Billy with his trappings on,    His nostrils swelling wide,  As though still on his gallant back    The master sat astride.  Right royally he took the place    That was of old his wont,  And with a neigh that seemed to say,    Above the battle's brunt,  "How can the Twenty-Second charge    If I am not in front?"  Like statues rooted there we stood,    And gazed a little space,  Above that floating mane we missed    The dear familiar face,  But we saw Bay Billy's eye of fire,    And it gave us heart of grace.  No bugle-call could rouse us all    As that brave sight had done,  Down all the battered line we felt    A lightning impulse run.  Up! up the hill we followed Bill,--    And we captured every gun!  And when upon the conquered height    Died out the battle's hum,  Vainly mid living and the dead    We sought our leader dumb.  It seemed as if a spectre steed    To win that day had come.  And then the dusk and dew of night    Fell softly o'er the plain,  As though o'er man's dread work of death    The angels wept again,  And drew night's curtain gently round    A thousand beds of pain.  All night the surgeons' torches went,    The ghastly rows between,--  All night with solemn step I paced    The torn and bloody green.  But who that fought in the big war    Such dread sights have not seen?  At last the morning broke. The lark    Sang in the merry skies,  As if to e'en the sleepers there    It bade awake, and rise!  Though naught but that last trump of all    Could ope their heavy eyes.  And then once more with banners gay,    Stretched out the long brigade.  Trimly upon the furrowed field    The troops stood on parade,  And bravely mid the ranks were closed    The gaps the fight had made.  Not half the Twenty-Second's men    Were in their place that morn;  And Corporal Dick, who yester-noon    Stood six brave fellows on,  Now touched my elbow in the ranks,    For all between were gone.  Ah I who forgets that dreary hour    When, as with misty eyes,  To call the old familiar roll    The solemn sergeant tries,--  One feels that thumping of the heart    As no prompt voice replies.  And as in faltering tone and slow    The last few names were said,  Across the field some missing horse    Toiled up the weary tread.  It caught the sergeant's eye, and quick    Bay Billy's name he read.  Yes! there the old bay hero stood,    All safe from battle's harms,  And ere an order could be heard,    Or the bugle's quick alarms,  Down all the front, from end to end,    The troops presented arms!  Not all the shoulder-straps on earth    Could still our mighty cheer;  And ever from that famous day,    When rang the roll call clear,  Bay Billy's name was read, and then    The whole line answered, "Here!"FRANK H. GASSAWAY.       *       *       *       *       *WOUNDED TO DEATH.      Steady, boys, steady!      Keep your arms ready,  God only knows whom we may meet here.      Don't let me be taken;      I'd rather awaken,  To-morrow, in--no matter where,  Than lie in that foul prison-hole--over there.        Step slowly!        Speak lowly!    These rocks may have life.      Lay me down in this hollow;    We are out of the strife.  By heavens! the foemen may track me in blood,  For this hole in my breast is outpouring a flood.  No! no surgeon for me; he can give me no aid;  The surgeon I want is pickaxe and spade.  What, Morris, a tear? Why, shame on ye, man!  I thought you a hero; but since you began  To whimper and cry like a girl in her teens,  By George! I don't know what the devil it means!  Well! well! I _am_, rough; 'tis a very rough school,  This life of a trooper,--but yet I'm no fool!  I know a brave man, and a friend from a foe;  And, boys, that you love me I certainly know;    But wasn't it grand  When they came down the hill over sloughing and sand!  But we stood--did we not?--like immovable rock,  Unheeding their balls and repelling their shock.    Did you mind the loud cry    When, as turning to fly,  Our men sprang upon them, determined to die?      O, wasn't it grand!  God help the poor wretches that fell in that fight;  No time was there given for prayer or for flight;  They fell by the score, in the crash, hand to hand,  And they mingled their blood with the sloughing and sand.        Huzza!  Great Heavens! this bullet-hole gapes like a grave;  A curse on the aim of the traitorous knave!  Is there never a one of ye knows how to pray,  Or speak for a man as his life ebbs away?        Pray!          Pray!  Our Father! our Father!... why don't ye proceed?  Can't you see I am dying? Great God, how I bleed!  Ebbing away!    Ebbing away!      The light of day      Is turning to gray.        Pray!          Pray!  Our Father in Heaven,--boys, tell me the rest,  While I stanch the hot blood from this hole in my breast.  There's something about the forgiveness of sin--  Put that in! put that in!--and then  I'll follow your words and say an amen.  Here, Morris, old fellow, get hold of my hand;  And, Wilson, my comrade--O, wasn't it grand  When they came down the hill like a thunder-charged cloud!  Where's Wilson, my comrade?--Here, stoop down your head;  Can't _you_ say a short prayer for the dying and dead!    "Christ God, who died for sinners all,      Hear thou this suppliant wanderer's cry;    Let not e'en this poor sparrow fall      Unheeded by thy gracious eye.    "Throw wide thy gates to let him in,      And take him, pleading, to thine arms;    Forgive, O Lord! his life-long sin.      And quiet all his fierce alarms."  God bless you, my comrade, for saying that hymn;  It is light to my path when my eye has grown dim.  I am dying--bend down till I touch you once more--  Don't forget me, old fellow,--God prosper this war!  Confusion to traitors!--keep hold of my hand--  And float the OLD FLAG o'er a prosperous land!JOHN W. WATSON.       *       *       *       *       *SOMEBODY'S DARLING.  Into a ward of the whitewashed halls    Where the dead and the dying lay,  Wounded by bayonets, shells, and balls,    Somebody's darling was borne one day--  Somebody's darling, so young and brave;    Wearing yet on his sweet pale face--  Soon to be hid in the dust of the grave--    The lingering light of his boyhood's grace.  Matted and damp are the curls of gold    Kissing the snow of that fair young brow;  Pale are the lips of delicate mould--    Somebody's darling is dying now.  Back from his beautiful blue-veined brow    Brush his wandering waves of gold;  Cross his hands on his bosom now--    Somebody's darling is still and cold.  Kiss him once for somebody's sake,    Murmur a prayer soft and low;  One bright curl from its fair mates take--    They were somebody's pride, you know.  Somebody's hand hath rested here--    Was it a mother's, soft and white?  Or have the lips of a sister fair    Been baptized in their waves of light?  God knows best. He has somebody's love,    Somebody's heart enshrined him there,  Somebody wafts his name above,    Night and morn, on the wings of prayer.  Somebody wept when he marched away,    Looking so handsome, brave, and grand;  Somebody's kiss on his forehead lay,    Somebody clung to his parting hand.  Somebody's watching and waiting for him,    Yearning to hold him again to her heart;  And there he lies with his blue eyes dim,    And the smiling, childlike lips apart.

Carve on the wooden slab o'er his head:    "Somebody's darling slumbers here."MARIA LA CONTE.       *       *       *       *       *TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP.

And wider still those billows of war  Thundered along the horizon's bar;  And louder yet into Winchester rolled  The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,  Making the blood of the listener cold  As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,  With Sheridan twenty miles away.  But there is a road from Winchester town,  A good, broad highway, leading down;  And there, through the flash of the morning light,  A steed as black as the steeds of night  Was seen to pass as with eagle flight.  As if he knew the terrible need,  He stretched away with the utmost speed;  Hills rose and fell,--but his heart was gay,  With Sheridan fifteen miles away.  Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering South,  The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth;  Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster,  Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster.  The heart of the steed and the heart of the master  Were beating, like prisoners assaulting their walls.  Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;  Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,  With Sheridan only ten miles away.  Under his spurning feet, the road  Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed,  And the landscape sped away behind,  Like an ocean flying before the wind;  And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,  Swept on, with his wild eyes full of fire;  But, lo! he is nearing his heart's desire,  He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,  With Sheridan only five miles away.  The first that the General saw were the groups  Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops;  What was done,--what to do,--a glance told him both,  And, striking his spurs with a terrible oath,  He dashed down the line mid a storm of huzzas,  And the wave of retreat checked its course there, because  The sight of the master compelled it to pause.  With foam and with dust the black charger was gray;  By the flash of his eye, and his nostril's play,  He seemed to the whole great army to say,  "I have brought you Sheridan all the way  From Winchester down, to save the day!"  Hurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!  Hurrah, hurrah, for horse and man!  And when their statues are placed on high,  Under the dome of the Union sky,--  The American soldier's Temple of Fame,--  There with the glorious General's name  Be it said in letters both bold and bright:  "Here is the steed that saved the day  By carrying Sheridan into the fight,  From Winchester,--twenty miles away!"THOMAS BUCHANAN READ.       *       *       *       *       *LEFT ON THE BATTLE-FIELD.  What, was it a dream? am I all alone    In the dreary night and the drizzling rain?  Hist!--ah, it was only the river's moan;    They have left me behind with the mangled slain.  Yes, now I remember it all too well!    We met, from the battling ranks apart;  Together our weapons Hashed and fell,    And mine was sheathed in his quivering heart.  In the cypress gloom, where the deed was done,    It was all too dark to see his face;  But I heard his death-groans, one by one,    And he holds me still in a cold embrace.  He spoke but once, and I could not hear    The words he said for the cannon's roar;  But my heart grew cold with a deadly fear,--    God! I had heard that voice before!  Had heard it before at our mother's knee,    When we lisped the words of our evening prayer!  My brother! would I had died for thee,--    This burden is more than my soul can bear!  I pressed my lips to his death-cold cheek,    And begged him to show me, by word or sign,  That he knew and forgave me: he could not speak,    But he nestled his poor cold face to mine.  The blood flowed fast from my wounded side,    And then for a while I forgot my pain,  And over the lakelet we seemed to glide    In our little boat, two boys again.  And then, in my dream, we stood alone    On a forest path where the shadows fell;  And I heard again the tremulous tone,    And the tender words of his last farewell.  But that parting was years, long years ago,    He wandered away to a foreign land;  And our dear old mother will never know    That he died to-night by his brother's hand.  The soldiers who buried the dead away    Disturbed not the clasp of that last embrace,  But laid them to sleep till the judgment-day,    Heart folded to heart, and face to face.SARAH TITTLE BOLTON.       *       *       *       *       *REQUIEMFOR ONE SLAIN IN BATTLE.  Breathe, trumpets, breathe    Slow notes of saddest wailing,--  Sadly responsive peal, ye muffled drums;  Comrades, with downcast eyes      And banners trailing,      Attend him home,--  The youthful warrior comes.  Upon his shield,    Upon his shield returning,  Borne from the field of honor    Where he fell;  Glory and grief, together clasped    In mourning,  His fame, his fate    With sobs exulting tell.  Wrap round his breast    The flag his breast defended,--  His country's flag,    In battle's front unrolled:  For it he died;    On earth forever ended  His brave young life    Lives in each sacred fold.  With proud fond tears,    By tinge of shame untainted,  Bear him, and lay him    Gently in his grave:  Above the hero write,--    The young, half-sainted,--  His country asked his life,    His life he gave!GEORGE LUNT.       *       *       *       *       *MUSIC IN CAMP.  Two armies covered hill and plain,    Where Rappahannock's waters  Ran deeply crimsoned with the stain    Of battle's recent slaughters.  The summer clouds lay pitched like tents    In meads of heavenly azure;  And each dread gun of the elements    Slept in its embrasure.  The breeze so softly blew, it made    No forest leaf to quiver,  And the smoke of the random cannonade    Rolled slowly from the river.  And now, where circling hills looked down    With cannon grimly planted,  O'er listless camp and silent town    The golden sunset slanted.  When on the fervid air there came    A strain--now rich, now tender;  The music seemed itself aflame    With day's departing splendor.  A Federal band, which, eve and morn,    Played measures brave and nimble,  Had just struck up, with flute and horn    And lively clash of cymbal.  Down flocked the soldiers to the banks,    Till, margined by its pebbles,  One wooded shore was blue with "Yanks,"    And one was gray with "Rebels."  Then all was still, and then the band,    With movements light and tricksy,  Made stream and forest, hill and strand,    Reverberate with "Dixie."  The conscious stream with burnished glow    Went proudly o'er its pebbles,  But thrilled throughout its deepest flow    With yelling of the Rebels.  Again a pause, and then again    The trumpets pealed sonorous,  And "Yankee Doodle" was the strain    To which the shore gave chorus.  The laughing ripple shoreward flew,    To kiss the shining pebbles;  Loud shrieked the swarming Boys in Blue    Defiance to the Rebels.  And yet once more the bugle sang    Above the stormy riot;  No shout upon the evening rang--    There reigned a holy quiet.  The sad, slow stream its noiseless flood    Poured o'er the glistening pebbles;  All silent now the Yankees stood,    And silent stood the Rebels.  No unresponsive soul had heard    That plaintive note's appealing,  So deeply "Home, Sweet Home" had stirred    The hidden fount of feeling.  Or Blue, or Gray, the soldier sees,    As by the wand of fairy,  The cottage 'neath the live-oak trees,    The cabin by the prairie.  Or cold, or warm, his native skies,    Bend in their beauty o'er him;  Seen through the tear-mist in his eyes,    His loved ones stand before him.  As fades the iris after rain    In April's tearful weather,  The vision vanished, as the strain    And daylight died together.  But memory, waked by music's art,    Expressed in simplest numbers,  Subdued the sternest Yankee's heart,    Made light the Rebel's slumbers.  And fair the form of Music shines,    That bright celestial creature.  Who still, 'mid war's embattled lines,    Gave this one touch of Nature.JOHN RANDOLPH THOMPSON.       *       *       *       *       *UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES.[The last words of Stonewall Jackson[A] were: "Let us cross the riverand rest under the shade of the trees."][Footnote A: Major-General Thomas J. Jackson, C.S.A., killed on areconnoissance, May 10, 1863.]  What are the thoughts that are stirring his breast?    What is the mystical vision he sees?  --"Let us pass over the river, and rest    Under the shade of the trees."  Has he grown sick of his toils and his tasks?    Sighs the worn spirit for respite or ease?  Is it a moment's cool halt that he asks    Under the shade of the trees?  Is it the gurgle of water whose flow    Ofttimes has come to him, borne on the breeze,  Memory listens to, lapsing so low,    Under the shade of the trees?  Nay--though the rasp of the flesh was so sore,    Faith, that had yearnings far keener than these,  Saw the soft sheen of the Thitherward Shore    Under the shade of the trees;--  Caught the high psalm of ecstatic delight--    Heard the harps harping, like soundings of seas--  Watched earth's assoiled ones walking in white    Under the shade of the trees.  Oh, was it strange he should pine for release,    Touched to the soul with such transports as these,--  He who so needed the balsam of peace,    Under the shade of the trees?  Yea, it was noblest for him--it was best    (Questioning naught of our Father's decrees),  There to pass over the river and rest    Under the shade of the trees!MARGARET JUNKIN PRESTON.       *       *       *       *       *THE BLACK REGIMENT.[May 27, 1863.]  Dark as the clouds of even,  Banked in the western heaven,  Waiting the breath that lifts  All the dead mass, and drifts  Tempest and falling brand  Over a ruined land,--  So still and orderly,  Arm to arm, knee to knee,  Waiting the great event,  Stands the black regiment.  Down the long dusty line  Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine;  And the bright bayonet,  Bristling and firmly set,  Flashed with a purpose grand,  Long ere the sharp command  Of the fierce rolling drum  Told them their time had come,  Told them what work was sent  For the black regiment.  "Now," the flag-sergeant cried,  "Though death and hell betide,  Let the whole nation see  If we are fit to be  Free in this land; or bound  Down, like the whining hound,--  Bound with red stripes of pain  In our cold chains again!"  O, what a shout there went  From the black regiment!  "Charge!" Trump and drum awoke;  Onward the bondmen broke;  Bayonet and sabre-stroke  Vainly opposed their rush.  Through the wild battle's crush,  With but one thought aflush,  Driving their lords like chaff,  In the guns' mouths they laugh;  Or at the slippery brands  Leaping with open hands,  Down they tear man and horse,  Down in their awful course;  Trampling with bloody heel  Over the crashing steel,--  All their eyes forward bent,  Rushed the black regiment.  "Freedom!" their battle-cry,--  "Freedom! or leave to die!"  Ah! and they meant the word,  Not as with us 'tis heard,  Not a mere party shout;  They gave their spirits out,  Trusted the end to God,  And on the gory sod  Rolled in triumphant blood.  Glad to strike one free blow,  Whether for weal or woe;  Glad to breathe one free breath,  Though on the lips of death;  Praying,--alas! in vain!--That  they might fall again,  So they could once more see  That burst to liberty!  This was what "freedom" lent  To the black regiment.  Hundreds on hundreds fell;  But they are resting well;  Scourges and shackles strong  Never shall do them wrong.  O, to the living few,  Soldiers, be just and true!  Hail them as comrades tried;  Fight with them side by side;  Never, in field or tent,  Scorn the black regiment!GEORGE HENRY BOKER.       *       *       *       *       *THE C.S. ARMY'S COMMISSARY.  I.--1863.  "Well, this is bad!" we sighing said,    While musing round the bivouac fire,    And dwelling with a fond desire,  On home and comforts long since fled.  "How gayly came we forth at first!    Our spirits high, with new emprise,    Ambitious of each exercise,  And glowing with a martial thirst.  "Equipped as for a holiday,    With bounteous store of everything    To use or comfort minist'ring,  All cheerily we marched away.  "But as the struggle fiercer grew,    Light marching orders came apace,--    And baggage-wagon soon gave place  To that which sterner uses knew.  "Our tents--they went a year ago;    Now kettle, spider, frying-pan    Are lost to us, and as we can  We live, while marching to and fro.  "Our food has lessened, till at length,    E'en want's gaunt image seems to threat--    A foe to whom the bravest yet  Must yield at last his knightly strength.  "But while we've meat and flour enough    The bayonet shall be our spit--    The ramrod bake our dough on it--  A gum-cloth be our kneading trough.  "We'll bear privation, danger dare,    While even these are left to us--    Be hopeful, faithful, emulous  Of gallant deeds, though hard our fare!"  II.--1864.  "Three years and more," we grimly said,    When order came to "Rest at will"    Beside the corn-field on the hill,  As on a weary march we sped--  "Three years and more we've met the foe    On many a gory, hard-fought field,    And still we swear we cannot yield  Till Fate shall bring some deeper woe.  "Three years and more we've struggled on,    Through torrid heat and winter's chill,    Nor bated aught of steadfast will,  Though even hope seems almost gone.  "Ill fed, ill clad, and shelterless,    How little cheer in health we know!    When wounds and illness lay us low,  How comfortless our sore distress!  "These flimsy rags, that scarcely hide    Our forms, can naught discourage us;    But Hunger--ah! it may be thus  That Fortune shall the strife decide.  "But while the corn-fields give supply    We'll take, content, the roasting-ear,    Nor yield us yet to craven fear,  But still press on, to do or die:"ED. PORTER THOMPSON.       *       *       *       *       *THE HIGH TIDE AT GETTYSBURG.[July 3, 1863.]  A cloud possessed the hollow field.  The gathering battle's smoky shield.  Athwart the gloom the lightning flashed,  And through the cloud some horsemen dashed,  And from the heights the thunder pealed.  Then at the brief command of Lee  Moved out that matchless infantry,  With Pickett leading grandly down,  To rush against the roaring crown  Of those dread heights of destiny.  Far heard above the angry guns  A cry across the tumult runs,--  The voice that rang through Shiloh's woods  And Chickamanga's solitudes,  The fierce South cheering on her sons!  Ah, how the withering tempest blew  Against the front of Pettigrew!  A Khamsin wind that scorched and singed  Like that infernal flame that fringed  The British squares at Waterloo!  A thousand fell where Kemper led;  A thousand died where Garnett bled:  In blinding flame and strangling smoke  The remnant through the batteries broke  And crossed the works with Armistead.  "Once more in Glory's van with me!"  Virginia cried to Tennessee;  "We two together, come what may,  Shall stand upon these works to-day!"  (The reddest day in history.)  Brave Tennessee! In reckless way  Virginia heard her comrade say:  "Close round this rent and riddled rag!"  What time she set her battle-flag  Amid the guns of Doubleday.  But who shall break the guards that wait  Before the awful face of Fate?  The tattered standards of the South  Were shrivelled at the cannon's mouth,  And all her hopes were desolate.  In vain the Tennesseean set  His breast against the bayonet!  In vain Virginia charged and raged,  A tigress in her wrath uncaged,  Till all the hill was red and wet!  Above the bayonets, mixed and crossed,  Men saw a gray, gigantic ghost  Receding through the battle-cloud,  And heard across the tempest loud  The death-cry of a nation lost!  The brave went down! Without disgrace  They leaped to Ruin's red embrace.  They only heard Fame's thunders wake,  And saw the dazzling sun-burst break  In smiles on Glory's bloody face!  They fell, who lifted up a hand  And bade the sun in heaven to stand!  They smote and fell, who set the bars  Against the progress of the stars,  And stayed the march of Motherland!  They stood, who saw the future come  On through the fight's delirium!  They smote and stood, who held the hope  Of nations on that slippery slope  Amid the cheers of Christendom.  God lives! He forged the iron will    That clutched and held that trembling hill.  God lives and reigns! He built and lent  The heights for Freedom's battlement  Where floats her flag in triumph still!  Fold up the banners! Smelt the guns!  Love rules. Her gentler purpose runs.  A mighty mother turns in tears  The pages of her battle years,  Lamenting all her fallen sons!WILL HENRY THOMPSON.       *       *       *       *       *LEE TO THE REAR.[An incident in one of the battles in the Wilderness at the beginningof the campaign of 1864.]  Dawn of a pleasant morning in May  Broke through the Wilderness cool and gray;  While perched in the tallest tree-tops, the birds  Were carolling Mendelssohn's "Songs without Words."  Far from the haunts of men remote,  The brook brawled on with a liquid note;  And Nature, all tranquil and lovely, wore  The smile of the spring, as in Eden of yore.  Little by little, as daylight increased,  And deepened the roseate flush in the East--  Little by little did morning reveal  Two long glittering lines of steel;  Where two hundred thousand bayonets gleam,  Tipped with the light of the earliest beam,  And the faces are sullen and grim to see  In the hostile armies of Grant and Lee.  All of a sudden, ere rose the sun,  Pealed on the silence the opening gun--  A little white puff of smoke there came,  And anon the valley was wreathed in flame.  Down on the left of the Rebel lines,  Where a breastwork stands in a copse of pines,  Before the Rebels their ranks can form,  The Yankees have carried the place by storm.  Stars and Stripes on the salient wave,  Where many a hero has found a grave,  And the gallant Confederates strive in vain  The ground they have drenched with their blood, to regain.  Yet louder the thunder of battle roared--  Yet a deadlier fire on the columns poured;  Slaughter infernal rode with Despair,  Furies twain, through the murky air.  Not far off, in the saddle there sat  A gray-bearded man in a black slouched hat;  Not much moved by the fire was he,  Calm and resolute Robert Lee.  Quick and watchful he kept his eye  On the bold Rebel brigades close by,--  Reserves that were standing (and dying) at ease,  While the tempest of wrath toppled over the trees.  For still with their loud, deep, bull-dog bay,  The Yankee batteries blazed away,  And with every murderous second that sped  A dozen brave fellows, alas! fell dead.  The grand old graybeard rode to the space  Where Death and his victims stood face to face,  And silently waved his old slouched hat--  A world of meaning there was in that!  "Follow me! Steady! We'll save the day!"  This was what he seemed to say;  And to the light of his glorious eye  The bold brigades thus made reply:  "We'll go forward, but you must go back "--  And they moved not an inch in the perilous track:  "Go to the rear, and we'll send them to hell!"  And the sound of the battle was lost in their yell.  Turning his bridle, Robert Lee  Rode to the rear. Like waves of the sea,  Bursting the dikes in their overflow,  Madly his veterans dashed on the foe.  And backward in terror that foe was driven,  Their banners rent and their columns riven,  Wherever the tide of battle rolled  Over the Wilderness, wood and wold.  Sunset out of a crimson sky  Streamed o'er a field of ruddier dye,  And the brook ran on with a purple stain,  From the blood of ten thousand foemen slain.  Seasons have passed since that day and year--  Again o'er its pebbles the brook runs clear,  And the field in a richer green is drest  Where the dead of a terrible conflict rest.  Hushed is the roll of the Rebel drum,  The sabres are sheathed, and the cannon are dumb;  And Fate, with his pitiless hand, has furled  The flag that once challenged the gaze of the world;  But the fame of the Wilderness fight abides;  And down into history grandly rides,  Calm and unmoved as in battle he sat,  The gray-bearded man in the black slouched hat.JOHN RANDOLPH THOMPSON.       *       *       *       *       *DRIVING HOME THE COWS.  Out of the clover and blue-eyed grass    He turned them into the river-lane;  One after another he let them pass,    Then fastened the meadow bars again.  Under the willows, and over the hill,    He patiently followed their sober pace;  The merry whistle for once was still,    And something shadowed the sunny face.  Only a boy! and his father had said    He never could let his youngest go;  Two already were lying dead    Under the feet of the trampling foe.  But after the evening work was done,    And the frogs were loud in the meadow-swamp,  Over his shoulder he slung his gun    And stealthily followed the foot-path damp,  Across the clover and through the wheat    With resolute heart and purpose grim,  Though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet,    And the blind bat's flitting startled him.  Thrice since then had the lanes been white,    And the orchards sweet with apple-bloom;  And now, when the cows came back at night,    The feeble father drove them home.  For news had come to the lonely farm    That three were lying where two had lain;  And the old man's tremulous, palsied arm    Could never lean on a son's again.  The summer day grew cool and late,    He went for the cows when the work was done;  But down the lane, as he opened the gate,    He saw them coming one by one,--  Brindle, Ebony, Speckle, and Bess,    Shaking their horns in the evening wind;  Cropping the buttercups out of the grass,--  But who was it following close behind?  Loosely swung in the idle air    The empty sleeve of army blue;  And worn and pale, from the crisping hair,    Looked out a face that the father knew.  For gloomy prisons will sometimes yawn,    And yield their dead unto life again;  And the day that comes with a cloudy dawn    In golden glory at last may wane.  The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes;    For the heart must speak when the lips are dumb;  And under the silent evening skies    Together they followed the cattle home.KATE PUTNAM OSGOOD.       *       *       *       *       *SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA.[A][Footnote A: This song was sung by thousands of Sherman's soldiersafter the march, and had the honor of giving its name to the campaignit celebrates. Its author had been one of Sherman's army, and wascaptured at the battle of Chattanooga. While a prisoner he escaped,disguised himself in a Confederate uniform, went to the Southern army,and witnessed some of the fierce fighting about Atlanta. He wasdiscovered and sent back to prison at Columbia, S.C., where he wrotethe song. He soon escaped again, rejoined Sherman's army, and for atime served on General Sherman's staff. From Cape Fear River he wassent North with despatches to Grant and President Lincoln, bringingthe first news of Sherman's successes in the Carolinas.][May 4 to December 21, 1864.]  Our camp-fires shone bright on the mountains    That frowned on the river below,  While we stood by our guns in the morning    And eagerly watched for the foe,  When a rider came out of the darkness    That hung over the mountain and tree,  And shouted, "Boys, up and be ready!    For Sherman will march to the sea."  Then cheer upon cheer for bold Sherman    Went up from each valley and glen,  And the bugles re-echoed the music    That came from the lips of the men;  For we knew that the stars in our banner    More bright in their splendor would be,  And that blessings from Northland would greet us    When Sherman marched down to the sea.  Then forward, boys, forward to battle,    We marched on our wearisome way,  We stormed the wild hills of Resaca;    God bless those who fell on that day!  Then Kenesaw, dark in its glory,    Frowned down on the flag of the free,  But the East and the West bore our standards,    And Sherman marched on to the sea.  Still onward we pressed, till our banners    Swept out from Atlanta's grim walls,  And the blood of the patriot dampened    The soil where the traitor flag falls;  Yet we paused not to weep for the fallen,    Who slept by each river and tree;  We twined them a wreath of the laurel    As Sherman marched down to the sea.  Oh! proud was our army that morning,    That stood where the pine darkly towers,  When Sherman said: "Boys, you are weary;    This day fair Savannah is ours!"  Then sang we a song for our chieftain,    That echoed o'er river and lea,  And the stars in our banner shone brighter    When Sherman marched down to the sea.SAMUEL H.M. BYERS.       *       *       *       *       *ARMY CORRESPONDENT'S LAST RIDE.FIVE FORKS, APRIL 1, 1865.  Ho! pony. Down the lonely road    Strike now your cheeriest pace!  The woods on fire do not burn higher    Than burns my anxious face;  Far have you sped, but all this night    Must feel my nervous spur;  If we be late, the world must wait    The tidings we aver:--  To home and hamlet, town and hearth,    To thrill child, mother, man,  I carry to the waiting North    Great news from Sheridan!  The birds are dead among the pines,    Slain by the battle fright,  Prone in the road the steed reclines    That never readied the fight;  Yet on we go,--the wreck below    Of many a tumbled wain,--  By ghastly pools where stranded mules    Die, drinking of the rain;  With but my list of killed and missed    I spur my stumbling nag,  To tell of death at many a tryst,    But victory to the flag!  "Halt! who comes there? The countersign!"--    "A friend."--"Advance! The fight,--  How goes it, say?"--"We won the day!"--    "Huzza! Pass on!"--"Good-night!"--  And parts the darkness on before,    And down the mire we tramp,  And the black sky is painted o'er    With many a pulsing camp;  O'er stumps and ruts, by ruined huts,    Where ghosts look through the gloam,--  Behind my tread I hear the dead    Follow the news toward home!  The hunted souls I see behind,    In swamp and in ravine,  Whose cry for mercy thrills the wind    Till cracks the sure carbine;  The moving lights, which scare the dark,    And show the trampled place  Where, in his blood, some mother's bud    Turns up his young, dead face;  The captives spent, whose standards rent    The conqueror parades,  As at the Five Forks roads arrive    The General's dashing aides.  O wondrous Youth! through this grand ruth    Runs my boy's life its thread;  The General's fame, the battle's name,    The rolls of maimed and dead  I bear, with my thrilled soul astir,    And lonely thoughts and fears;  And am but History's courier    To bind the conquering years;  A battle-ray, through ages gray    To light to deeds sublime,  And flash the lustre of this day   Down all the aisles of Time!  Ho! pony,--'tis the signal gun    The night-assault decreed;  On Petersburg the thunderbolts    Crash from the lines of Meade;  Fade the pale, frightened stars o'erhead,    And shrieks the bursting air;  The forest foliage, tinted red,    Grows ghastlier in the glare;  Though in her towers, reached her last hours,    Rocks proud Rebellion's crest--  The world may sag, if but my nag    Get in before the rest!  With bloody flank, and fetlocks dank,    And goad, and lash, and shout--  Great God! as every hoof-beat falls    A hundred lives beat out!  As weary as this broken steed    Reels down the corduroys,  So, weary, fight for morning light    Our hot and grimy boys;  Through ditches wet, o'er parapet    And guns barbette, they catch  The last, lost breach; and I,--I reach    The mail with my despatch!  Sure it shall speed, the land to read,    As sped the happiest shell!  The shot I send strike the world's end;    _This_ tells my pony's knell;  His long race run, the long war done,    My occupation gone,--  Above his bier, prone on the pier,    The vultures fleck the dawn.  Still, rest his bones where soldiers dwell,    Till the Long Roll they catch.  He fell the day that Richmond fell,    And took the first despatch!GEORGE ALFRED TOWNSEND.       *       *       *       *       *THE YEAR OF JUBILEE.[A][Footnote A: Sung by negro troops when entering Richmond.

Furl that Banner, for 'tis weary;  Round its staff 'tis drooping dreary:    Furl it, fold it,--it is best;  For there's not a man to wave it,  And there's not a sword to save it,  And there's not one left to lave it  In the blood which heroes gave it,  And its foes now scorn and brave it:    Furl it, hide it,--let it rest!  Take that Banner down! 'tis tattered;  Broken is its staff and shattered;  And the valiant hosts are scattered,    Over whom it floated high.  Oh, 'tis hard for us to fold it,  Hard to think there's none to hold it,  Hard that those who once unrolled it    Now must furl it with a sigh!  Furl that Banner--furl it sadly!  Once ten thousands hailed it gladly,  And ten thousands wildly, madly,    Swore it should forever wave;  Swore that foeman's sword should never  Hearts like theirs entwined dissever,  Till that flag should float forever    O'er their freedom or their grave!  Furl it! for the hands that grasped it,  And the hearts that fondly clasped it,    Cold and dead are lying low;  And that Banner--it is trailing,  While around it sounds the wailing    Of its people in their woe.  For, though conquered, they adore it,--  Love the cold, dead hands that bore it,  Weep for those who fell before it,  Pardon those who trailed and tore it;  And oh, wildly they deplore it,    Now to furl and fold it so!  Furl that Banner! True, 'tis gory,  Yet 'tis wreathed around with glory,  And 't will live in song and story    Though its folds are in the dust!  For its fame on brightest pages,  Penned by poets and by sages,  Shall go sounding down the ages--    Furl its folds though now we must.  Furl that Banner, softly, slowly!  Treat it gently--it is holy,    For it droops above the dead.  Touch it not--unfold it never;  Let it droop there, furled forever,--      For its people's hopes are fled!ABRAM JOSEPH RYAN.       *       *       *       *       *ALL.  There hangs a sabre, and there a rein,  With a rusty buckle and green curb chain;  A pair of spurs on the old gray wall,  And a mouldy saddle--well, that is all.  Come out to the stable--it is not far;  The moss grown door is hanging ajar.  Look within! There's an empty stall,  Where once stood a charger, and that is all.  The good black horse came riderless home,  Flecked with blood drops as well as foam;  See yonder hillock where dead leaves fall;  The good black horse pined to death--that's all.  All? O, God! it is all I can speak.  Question me not--I am old and weak;  His sabre and his saddle hang on the wall,  And his horse pined to death--I have told you all.FRANCIS ALEXANDER DURIVAGE.       *       *       *       *       *THE CLOSING SCENE.  Within the sober realm of leafless trees,    The russet year inhaled the dreamy air;  Like some tanned reaper, in his hour of ease,    When all the fields are lying brown and bare.  The gray barns looking from their hazy hills,    O'er the dun waters widening in the vales,  Sent down the air a greeting to the mills    On the dull thunder of alternate flails.  All sights were mellowed and all sounds subdued,    The hills seemed further and the stream sang low,  As in a dream the distant woodman hewed    His winter log with many a muffled blow.  The embattled forests, erewhile armed with gold,    Their banners bright with every martial hue,  Now stood like some sad, beaten host of old,    Withdrawn afar in Time's remotest blue.  On slumb'rous wings the vulture held his flight;    The dove scarce heard its sighing mate's complaint;  And, like a star slow drowning in the light,    The village church-vane seemed to pale and faint.  The sentinel-cock upon the hillside crew,--    Crew thrice,--and all was stiller than before;  Silent, till some replying warden blew    His alien horn, and then was heard no more.  Where erst the jay, within the elm's tall crest,    Made garrulous trouble round her unfledged young;  And where the oriole hung her swaying nest,    By every light wind like a censer swung;--  Where sang the noisy martens of the eaves,    The busy swallows circling ever near,--  Foreboding, as the rustic mind believes,    An early harvest and a plenteous year;--  Where every bird which charmed the vernal feast    Shook the sweet slumber from its wings at morn,  To warn the reaper of the rosy east:--    All now was sunless, empty, and forlorn.  Alone from out the stubble piped the quail,    And croaked the crow through all the dreamy gloom;  Alone the pheasant, drumming in the vale,    Made echo to the distant cottage-loom.  There was no bud, no bloom upon the bowers;    The spiders moved their thin shrouds night by night,  The thistle-down, the only ghost of flowers,    Sailed slowly by,--passed noiseless out of sight.  Amid all this--in this most cheerless air,    And where the woodbine shed upon the porch  Its crimson leaves, as if the Year stood there    Firing the floor with his inverted torch,--  Amid all this, the centre of the scene,    The white-haired matron with monotonous tread  Plied the swift wheel, and with her joyless mien    Sat, like a fate, and watched the flying thread,  She had known Sorrow,--he had walked with her,    Oft supped, and broke the bitter ashen crust;  And in the dead leaves still she heard the stir    Of his black mantle trailing in the dust.  While yet her cheek was bright with summer bloom,    Her country summoned and she gave her all;  And twice War bowed to her his sable plume,--    Re-gave the swords to rust upon the wall.  Re-gave the swords, but not the hand that drew    And struck for Liberty the dying blow;  Nor him who, to his sire and country true,    Fell mid the ranks of the invading foe.  Long, but not loud, the droning wheel went on,    Like the low murmur of a hive at noon;  Long, but not loud, the memory of the gone    Breathed through her lips a sad and tremulous tune.  At last the thread was snapped; her head was bowed;    Life dropt the distaff through his hands serene;  And loving neighbors smoothed her careful shroud,    While Death and Winter closed the autumn scene.THOMAS BUCHANAN READ.       *       *       *       *       *THE MEN BEHIND THE GUNS.[The Spanish-American War, 1898.]  A cheer and salute for the Admiral, and here's to the Captain bold,  And never forget the Commodore's debt when the deeds of might are          told!  They stand to the deck through the battle's wreck when the great          shells roar and screech--  And never they fear when the foe is near to practise what they          preach:  But off with your hat and three times three for Columbia's true-blue          sons,  The men below who batter the foe--the men behind the guns!  Oh, light and merry of heart are they when they swing into port once          more,  When, with more than enough of the "green-backed stuff," they start          for their leave-o'-shore;  And you'd think, perhaps, that the blue-bloused chaps who loll along          the street  Are a tender bit, with salt on it, for some fierce "mustache" to          eat--  Some warrior bold, with straps of gold, who dazzles and fairly stuns  The modest worth of the sailor boys--the lads who serve the guns.  But say not a word till the shot is heard that tells the fight is          on.  Till the long, deep roar grows more and more from the ships of          "Yank" and "Don,"  Till over the deep the tempests sweep of fire and bursting shell,  And the very air is a mad Despair in the throes of a living hell;  Then down, deep down, in the mighty ship, unseen by the midday suns,  You'll find the chaps who are giving the raps--the men behind the          guns!  Oh, well they know how the cyclones blow that they loose from their          cloud of death,  And they know is heard the thunder-word their fierce ten-incher          saith!  The steel decks rock with the lightning shock, and shake with the          great recoil,  And the sea grows red with the blood of the dead and reaches for his          spoil--  But not till the foe has gone below or turns his prow and runs,  Shall the voice of peace bring sweet release to the men behind the          guns!JOHN JEROME ROONEY.       *       *       *       *       *THE BATTLE OF MANILA.A FRAGMENT.[May I, 1898.]  By Cavite on the bay  'Twas the Spanish squadron lay;  And the red dawn was creeping  O'er the city that lay sleeping  To the east, like a bride, in the May.  There was peace at Manila,  In the May morn at Manila,--  When ho, the Spanish admiral  Awoke to find our line  Had passed by gray Corregidor,  Had laughed at shoal and mine,  And flung to the sky its banners  With "Remember" for the sign!  With the ships of Spain before  In the shelter of the shore,  And the forts on the right,  They drew forward to the fight,  And the first was the gallant Commodore;  In the bay of Manila,  In the doomed bay of Manila--  With succor half the world away,  No port beneath that sky,  With nothing but their ships and guns  And Yankee pluck to try,  They had left retreat behind them,  They had come to win or die!       *       *       *       *       *  For we spoke at Manila,  We said it at Manila,  Oh be ye brave, or be ye strong,  Ye build your ships in vain;  The children of the sea queen's brood  Will not give up the main;  We hold the sea against the world  As we held it against Spain.  Be warned by Manila,  Take warning by Manila,  Ye may trade by land, ye may fight by land,  Ye may hold the land in fee;  But not go down to the sea in ships  To battle with the free;  For England and America  Will keep and hold the sea!RICHARD HOVEY.       *       *       *       *       *IV.PEACE.       *       *       *       *       *ODE TO PEACE.  Daughter of God! that sitt'st on high  Amid the dances of the sky,  And guidest with thy gentle sway  The planets on their tuneful way;    Sweet Peace! shall ne'er again  The smile of thy most holy face,  From thine ethereal dwelling-place,  Rejoice the wretched, weary race    Of discord-breathing men?  Too long, O gladness-giving Queen!  Thy tarrying in heaven has been;  Too long o'er this fair blooming world  The flag of blood has been unfurled,    Polluting God's pure day;  Whilst, as each maddening people reels,  War onward drives his scythed wheels,  And at his horses' bloody heels    Shriek Murder and Dismay.  Oft have I wept to hear the cry  Of widow wailing bitterly;  To see the parent's silent tear  For children fallen beneath the spear;    And I have felt so sore  The sense of human guilt and woe,  That I, in Virtue's passioned glow,  Have cursed (my soul was wounded so)    The shape of man I bore!  Then come from thy serene abode,  Thou gladness-giving child of God!  And cease the world's ensanguined strife,  And reconcile my soul to life;    For much I long to see,  Ere I shall to the grave descend,  Thy hand its blessed branch extend,  And to the world's remotest end    Wave Love and Harmony!WILLIAM TENNANT.       *       *       *       *       *END OF THE CIVIL WAR.FROM KING RICHARD III., ACT I. SC. I.  Now is the winter of our discontent  Made glorious summer by this sun of York,  And all the clouds that lowered upon our house  In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.  Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;  Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;  Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,  Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.  Grim-visaged War hath smoothed his wrinkled front.  And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds  To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,  He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber,  To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.SHAKESPEARE.       *       *       *       *       *DISARMAMENT.  "Put up the sword!" the voice of Christ once more  Speaks, in the pauses of the cannon's roar,  O'er fields of corn by fiery sickles reaped  And left dry ashes; over trenches heaped  With nameless dead; o'er cities starving slow  Under a rain of fire; through wards of woe  Down which a groaning diapason runs  From tortured brothers, husbands, lovers, sons  Of desolate women in their far-off homes,  Waiting to hear the step that never comes!  O men and brothers! let that voice be heard.  War fails, try peace; put up the useless sword!  Fear not the end. There is a story told  In Eastern tents, when autumn nights grow cold,  And round the fire the Mongol shepherds sit  With grave responses listening unto it:  Once on the errands of his mercy bent,  Buddha, the holy and benevolent,  Met a fell monster, huge and fierce of look,  Whose awful voice the hills and forests shook.  "O son of peace!" the giant cried, "thy fate  Is sealed at last, and love shall yield to hate."  The unarmed Buddha looking, with no trace  Of fear or anger, in the monster's face,  In pity said, "Poor fiend, even thee I love."  Lo! as he spake the sky-tall terror sank  To hand-breadth size; the huge abhorrence shrank  Into the form and fashion of a dove;  And where the thunder of its rage was heard,  Circling above him sweetly sang the bird:  "Hate hath no harm for love," so ran the song,  "And peace unweaponed conquers every wrong!"JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.       *       *       *       *       *TUBAL CAIN.  Old Tubal Cain was a man of might,    In the days when earth was young;  By the fierce red light of his furnace bright,    The strokes of his hammer rung:  And he lifted high his brawny hand    On the iron glowing clear,  Till the sparks rushed out in scarlet showers,    As he fashioned the sword and the spear.  And he sang: "Hurrah for my handiwork!    Hurrah for the spear and the sword!  Hurrah for the hand that shall wield them well,    For he shall be king and lord."  To Tubal Cain came many a one,    As he wrought by his roaring fire,  And each one prayed for a strong steel blade    As the crown of his desire:  And he made them weapons sharp and strong,    Till they shouted loud for glee,  And gave him gifts of pearl and gold,    And spoils of the forest free.  And they sang: "Hurrah for Tubal Cain,    Who hath given us strength anew!  Hurrah for the smith, hurrah for the fire,    And hurrah for the metal true!"  But a sudden change came o'er his heart,    Ere the setting of the sun,  And Tubal Cain was filled with pain    For the evil he had done;  He saw that men, with rage and hate,    Made war upon their kind,  That the land was red with the blood they shed,    In their lust for carnage blind.  And he said: "Alas! that ever I made,    Or that skill of mine should plan,  The spear and the sword for men whose joy    Is to slay their fellow-man!"  And for many a day old Tubal Cain    Sat brooding o'er his woe;  And his hand forbore to smite the ore,    And his furnace smouldered low.  But he rose at last with a cheerful face,    And a bright courageous eye,  And bared his strong right arm for work,    While the quick flames mounted high.  And he sang: "Hurrah for my handiwork!"    And the red sparks lit the air;  "Not alone for the blade was the bright steel made,"--    And he fashioned the first ploughshare.  And men, taught wisdom from the past,    In friendship joined their hands,  Hung the sword in the hall, the spear on the wall,    And ploughed the willing lands;  And sang: "Hurrah for Tubal Cain!    Our stanch good friend is he;  And for the ploughshare and the plough    To him our praise shall be.  But while oppression lifts its head,    Or a tyrant would be lord,  Though we may thank him for the plough,    We'll not forget the sword!"CHARLES MACKAY.       *       *       *       *       *THE KNIGHT'S TOMB.  Where is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn?  Where may the grave of that good man be?--  By the side of a spring, on the breast of Helvellyn,  Under the twigs of a young birch-tree!  The oak that in summer was sweet to hear,  And rustled its leaves in the fall of the year,  And whistled and roared in the winter alone,  Is gone,--and the birch in its stead is grown.--  The knight's bones are dust,  And his good sword rust;--  His soul is with the saints, I trust.SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.       *       *       *       *       *NOT ON THE BATTLE-FIELD."To fall on the battle-field fighting for my dear country,--that wouldnot be hard."--_The Neighbors_.    O no, no,--let me lie  Not on a field of battle when I die!    Let not the iron tread  Of the mad war-horse crush my helmed head;    Nor let the reeking knife,  That I have drawn against a brother's life,    Be in my hand when Death  Thunders along, and tramples me beneath    His heavy squadron's heels,  Or gory felloes of his cannon's wheels.    From such a dying bed,  Though o'er it float the stripes of white and red,    And the bald eagle brings  The clustered stars upon his wide-spread wings    To sparkle in my sight,  O, never let my spirit take her flight!    I know that beauty's eye  Is all the brighter where gay pennants fly,    And brazen helmets dance,  And sunshine flashes on the lifted lance;    I know that bards have sung,  And people shouted till the welkin rung,    In honor of the brave  Who on the battle-field have found a grave;    I know that o'er their bones  How grateful hands piled monumental stones.    Some of those piles I've seen:  The one at Lexington upon the green    Where the first blood was shed,  And to my country's independence led;    And others, on our shore,  The "Battle Monument" at Baltimore,    And that on Bunker's Hill.  Ay, and abroad, a few more famous still;    Thy "tomb," Themistocles,  That looks out yet upon the Grecian seas,    And which the waters kiss  That issue from the gulf of Salamis.    And thine, too, have I seen,  Thy mound of earth, Patroclus, robed in green,    That, like a natural knoll,  Sheep climb and nibble over as they stroll,    Watched by some turbaned boy,  Upon the margin of the plain of Troy.    Such honors grace the bed,  I know, whereon the warrior lays his head,    And hears, as life ebbs out,  The conquered flying, and the conqueror's shout;    But as his eye grows dim,  What is a column or a mound to him?    What, to the parting soul.  The mellow note of bugles? What the roll    Of drums? No, let me die  Where the blue heaven bends o'er me lovingly,    And the soft summer air,  As it goes by me, stirs my thin white hair,    And from my forehead dries  The death-damp as it gathers, and the skies    Seem waiting to receive  My soul to their clear depths! Or let me leave    The world when round my bed  Wife, children, weeping friends are gathered,    And the calm voice of prayer  And holy hymning shall my soul prepare    To go and be at rest  With kindred spirits,--spirits who have blessed    The human brotherhood  By labors, cares, and counsels for their good.JOHN PIERPONT.       *       *       *       *       *THE DAY IS COMING.  Come hither lads and hearken,    for a tale there is to tell,  Of the wonderful days a-coming,    when all shall be better than well.  And the tale shall be told of a country,    a land in the midst of the sea,  And folk shall call it England    in the days that are going to be.  There more than one in a thousand,    in the days that are yet to come,  Shall have some hope of the morrow,    some joy of the ancient home.  For then--laugh not, but listen    to this strange tale of mine--  All folk that are in England    shall be better lodged than swine.  Then a man shall work and bethink him,    and rejoice in the deeds of his hand;  Nor yet come home in the even    too faint and weary to stand.  Men in that time a-coming    shall work and have no fear  For to-morrow's lack of earning,    and the hunger-Wolf anear.  I tell you this for a wonder,    that no man then shall be glad  Of his fellow's fall and mishap,    to snatch at the work he had.  For that which the worker winneth    shall then be his indeed,  Nor shall half be reaped for nothing    by him that sowed no seed.  Oh, strange new wonderful justice!    But for whom shall we gather the gain?  For ourselves and for each of our fellows,    and no hand shall labor in vain.  Then all Mine and all Thine shall be Ours,    and no more shall any man crave  For riches that serve for nothing    but to fetter a friend for a slave.  And what wealth then shall be left us,    when none shall gather gold  To buy his friend in the market,    and pinch and pine the sold?  Nay, what save the lovely city,    and the little house on the hill,  And the wastes and the woodland beauty,    and the happy fields we till;  And the homes of ancient stories,    the tombs of the mighty dead;  And the wise men seeking out marvels,    and the poet's teeming head;  And the painter's hand of wonder,    and the marvellous fiddle-bow,  And the banded choirs of music:    all those that do and know.  For all these shall be ours and all men's;    nor shall any lack a share  Of the toil and the gain of living,    in the days when the world grows fair.  Ah! such are the days that shall be!    But what are the deeds of to-day,  In the days of the years we dwell in,    that wear our lives away?  Why, then, and for what are we waiting?    There are three words to speak:  _We will it_, and what is the foeman    but the dream-strong wakened and weak?  Oh, why and for what are we waiting,    while our brothers droop and die,  And on every wind of the heavens    a wasted life goes by?  How long shall they reproach us,    where crowd on crowd they dwell,--  Poor ghosts of the wicked city,    the gold-crushed hungry hell?  Through squalid life they labored,    in sordid grief they died,--  Those sons of a mighty mother,    those props of England's pride.  They are gone; there is none can undo it,    nor save our souls from the curse:  But many a million cometh,    and shall they be better or worse?  It is we must answer and hasten,    and open wide the door  For the rich man's hurrying terror,    and the slow-foot hope of the poor.  Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched,    and their unlearned discontent,--  We must give it voice and wisdom    till the waiting-tide be spent.  Come then, since all things call us,    the living and the dead,  And o'er the weltering tangle    a glimmering light is shed.  Come then, let us cast off fooling,    and put by ease and rest,  For the Cause alone is worthy    till the good days bring the best.  Come, join in the only battle    wherein no man can fail,  Where whoso fadeth and dieth,    yet his deed shall still prevail.  Ah! come, cast off all fooling,    for this, at least, we know:  That the dawn and the day is coming,    and forth the banners go.WILLIAM MORRIS.       *       *       *       *       *THE GRAVE OF BONAPARTE.  On a lone barren isle, where the wild roaring billows    Assail the stern rock, and the loud tempests rave,  The hero lies still, while the dew-drooping willows,    Like fond weeping mourners, lean over the grave.  The lightnings may flash, and the loud thunders rattle:    He heeds not, he hears not, he's free from all pain;--  He sleeps his last sleep--he has fought his last battle!    No sound can awake him to glory again!  O shade of the mighty, where now are the legions    That rushed but to conquer when thou led'st them on?  Alas! they have perished in far hilly regions,    And all save the fame of their triumph is gone!  The trumpet may sound, and the loud cannon rattle!    They heed not, they hear not, they're free from all pain:  They sleep their last sleep, they have fought their last battle!    No sound can awake them to glory again!  Yet, spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee,    For, like thine own eagle that soared to the sun,  Thou springest from bondage and leavest behind thee    A name which before thee no mortal had won.  Though nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle,    No more on the steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain:  Thou sleep'st thy last sleep, thou hast fought thy last battle!    No sound can awake thee to glory again!LEONARD HEATH.       *       *       *       *       *THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM.[In Bavaria, August 13, 1704, between the English and Austrians on oneside, under the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, and the Frenchand Bavarians on the other side, led by Marshal Tallart and theElector of Bavaria. The latter party was defeated, and the schemes ofLouis XIV. of France were materially checked.]  It was a summer evening,--    Old Kaspar's work was done,  And he before his cottage door    Was sitting in the sun;  And by him sported on the green  His little grandchild Wilhelmine.  She saw her brother Peterkin    Roll something large and round,  Which he beside the rivulet,    In playing there, had found;  He came to ask what he had found  That was so large and smooth and round.  Old Kaspar took it from the boy,    Who stood expectant by;  And then the old man shook his head,    And, with a natural sigh,--  "'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,  "Who fell in the great victory.  "I find them in the garden,    For there's many hereabout;  And often, when I go to plough,    The ploughshare turns them out;  For many thousand men," said he,    "Were slain in the great victory."  "Now tell us what 'twas all about."    Young Peterkin he cries;  And little Wilhelmine looks up    With wonder-waiting eyes,--  "Now tell us all about the war,  And what they fought each other for."  "It was the English," Kaspar cried,    "Who put the French to rout;  But what they fought each other for    I could not well make out;  But everybody said," quoth he,  "That 'twas a famous victory.  "My father lived at Blenheim then,    Yon little stream hard by;  They burnt his dwelling to the ground,    And he was forced to fly;  So with his wife and child he fled,  Nor had he where to rest his head.  "With fire and sword the country round    Was wasted far and wide;  And many a childing mother there,    And new-born baby died;  But things like that, you know, must be  At every famous victory.  "They say it was a shocking sight    After the field was won,--  For many thousand bodies here    Lay rotting in the sun;  But things like that, you know must be  After a famous victory.  "Great praise the Duke of Marlborough won,    And our good Prince Eugene."  "Why, 'twas a very wicked thing!"    Said little Wilhelmine.  "Nay, nay, my little girl!" quoth he,  "It was a famous victory.  "And everybody praised the duke    Who this great fight did win."  "But what good came of it at last?"    Quoth little Peterkin.  "Why, that I cannot tell," said he;  "But 'twas a famous victory."ROBERT SOUTHEY.       *       *       *       *       *AT GIBRALTAR.  I.  England, I stand on thy imperial ground    Not all a stranger; as thy bugles blow,    I feel within my blood old battles flow,--  The blood whose ancient founts are in thee found  Still surging dark against the Christian bound    While Islam presses; well its peoples know    Thy heights that watch them wandering below:  I think how Lucknow heard their gathering sound.  I turn and meet the cruel, turbaned face.    England! 'tis sweet to be so much thy son!  I feel the conqueror in my blood and race;    Last night Trafalgar awed me, and to-day  Gibraltar wakened; hark, thy evening gun    Startles the desert over Africa.  II.  Thou art the rock of empire set mid-seas    Between the East and West, that God has built;    Advance thy Roman borders where thou wilt,  While run thy armies true with his decrees;  Law, justice, liberty,--great gifts are these.    Watch that they spread where English blood is spilt,    Lest, mixed and sullied with his country's guilt  The soldier's life-stream flow, and Heaven displease!  Two swords there are: one naked, apt to smite,    Thy blade of war; and, battle-storied, one  Rejoices in the sheath, and hides from light.    American I am; would wars were done!  Now westward, look, my country bids good night,--    Peace to the world, from ports without a gun!GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY.       *       *       *       *       *THE BIVOUAC OF THE DEAD.[Dedication of a monument to Kentucky volunteers, killed at BuenaVista, Mexico.]  The muffled drum's sad roll has beat    The soldier's last tattoo;  No more on Life's parade shall meet    That brave and fallen few.  On Fame's eternal camping-ground    Their silent tents are spread,  And Glory guards, with solemn round,    The bivouac of the dead.  No rumor of the foe's advance    Now swells upon the wind;  No troubled thought at midnight haunts    Of loved ones left behind;  No vision of the morrow's strife    The warrior's dream alarms;  No braying horn nor screaming fife    At dawn shall call to arms.  Their shivered swords are red with rust,    Their plumed heads are bowed;  Their haughty banner, trailed in dust,    Is now their martial shroud.  And plenteous funeral tears have washed    The red stains from each brow,  And the proud forms, by battle gashed,    Are free from anguish now.  The neighing troop, the flashing blade,    The bugle's stirring blast,  The charge, the dreadful cannonade,    The din and shout, are past;  Nor war's wild note nor glory's peal    Shall thrill with fierce delight  Those breasts that nevermore may feel    The rapture of the fight.  Like the fierce northern hurricane    That sweeps his great plateau,  Flushed with the triumph yet to gain,    Came down the serried foe.  Who heard the thunder of the fray    Break o'er the field beneath,  Knew well the watchword of that day    Was "Victory or Death."  Long had the doubtful conflict raged    O'er all that stricken plain,  For never fiercer fight had waged    The vengeful blood of Spain;  And still the storm of battle blew,    Still swelled the gory tide;  Not long, our stout old chieftain knew,    Such odds his strength could bide.  'Twas in that hour his stern command    Called to a martyr's grave  The flower of his beloved land,    The nation's flag to save.  By rivers of their fathers' gore    His first-born laurels grew,  And well he deemed the sons would pour    Their lives for glory too.  Full many a norther's breath has swept    O'er Angostura's plain,  And long the pitying sky has wept    Above its mouldered slain.  The raven's scream, or eagle's flight,    Or shepherd's pensive lay,  Alone awakes each sullen height    That frowned o'er that dread fray.  Sons of the Dark and Bloody Ground,    Ye must not slumber there,  Where stranger steps and tongues resound    Along the heedless air.  Your own proud land's heroic soil    Shall be your fitter grave:  She claims from war his richest spoil--    The ashes of her brave.  Thus 'neath their parent turf they rest,    Far from the gory field,  Borne to a Spartan mother's breast    On many a bloody shield;  The sunshine of their native sky    Smiles sadly on them here,  And kindred eyes and hearts watch by    The heroes' sepulchre.  Rest on, embalmed and sainted dead!    Dear as the blood ye gave;  No impious footstep here shall tread    The herbage of your grave;  Nor shall your glory be forgot    While Fame her record keeps,  Or Honor points the hallowed spot    Where Valor proudly sleeps.  Yon marble minstrel's voiceless stone    In deathless song shall tell,  When many a vanished age hath flown,    The story how ye fell;  Nor wreck, nor change, nor winter's blight,    Nor Time's remorseless doom.  Shall dim one ray of glory's light    That gilds your deathless tomb.THEODORE O'HARA.       *       *       *       *       *THE ARSENAL AT SPRINGFIELD.  This is the arsenal. From floor to ceiling,    Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms;  But from their silent pipes no anthem pealing    Startles the villages with strange alarms.  Ah! what a sound will rise--how wild and dreary--    When the death-angel touches those swift keys!  What loud lament and dismal miserere    Will mingle with their awful symphonies!  I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus--    The cries of agony, the endless groan,  Which, through the ages that have gone before us,    In long reverberations reach our own.  On helm and harness rings the Saxon hammer;    Through Cimbric forest roars the Norseman's song;  And loud amid the universal clamor,    O'er distant deserts sounds the Tartar gong.  I hear the Florentine, who from his palace    Wheels out his battle-bell with dreadful din;  And Aztec priests upon their teocallis    Beat the wild war-drums made of serpents' skin;  The tumult of each sacked and burning village;    The shout that every prayer for mercy drowns;  The soldiers' revels in the midst of pillage;    The wail of famine in beleaguered towns;  The bursting shell, the gateway wrenched asunder,    The rattling musketry, the clashing blade--  And ever and anon, in tones of thunder,    The diapason of the cannonade.  Is it, O man, with such discordant noises,    With such accursed instruments as these,  Thou drownest nature's sweet and kindly voices,    And jarrest the celestial harmonies?  Were half the power that fills the world with terror,  Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts,  Given to redeem the human mind from error,    There were no need of arsenals nor forts;  The warrior's name would be a name abhorred;    And every nation that should lift again  Its hand against a brother, on its forehead    Would wear forevermore the curse of Cain!  Down the dark future, through long generations,    The echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease;  And like a bell, with solemn, sweet vibrations,    I hear once more the voice of Christ say, "Peace!"  Peace!--and no longer from its brazen portals    The blast of war's great organ shakes the skies;  But, beautiful as songs of the immortals,    The holy melodies of love arise.HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.       *       *       *       *       *AN OLD BATTLE-FIELD.  The softest whisperings of the scented South,  And rust and roses in the cannon's mouth;  And, where the thunders of the fight were born,  The wind's sweet tenor in the standing corn;  With song of larks, low-lingering in the loam,  And blue skies bending over love and home.  But still the thought: Somewhere,--upon the hills,  Or where the vales ring with the whip-poor-wills,  Sad wistful eyes and broken hearts that beat  For the loved sound of unreturning feet,  And, when the oaks their leafy banners wave,  Dream of the battle and an unmarked grave!FRANK LEBBY STANTON.       *       *       *       *       *THE BATTLE-FIELD.  Once this soft turf, this rivulet's sands,    Were trampled by a hurrying crowd,  And fiery hearts and armed hands    Encountered in the battle-cloud.  Ah! never shall the land forget    How gushed the life-blood of her brave,--  Gushed, warm with hope and courage yet,    Upon the soil they fought to save.  Now all is calm and fresh and still;    Alone the chirp of flitting bird,  And talk of children on the hill,    And bell of wandering kine, are heard.  No solemn host goes trailing by    The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain;  Men start not at the battle-cry,--    O, be it never heard again!  Soon rested those who fought; but thou    Who minglest in the harder strife  For truths which men receive not now,    Thy warfare only ends with life.  A friendless warfare! lingering long    Through weary day and weary year;  A wild and many-weaponed throng    Hang on thy front and flank and rear.  Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,    And blench not at thy chosen lot;  The timid good may stand aloof,    The sage may frown,--yet faint thou not.  Nor heed the shaft too surely cast,    The foul and hissing bolt of scorn;  For with thy side shall dwell, at last,    The victory of endurance born.  Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again,--    The eternal years of God are hers;  But Error, wounded, writhes in pain,    And dies among his worshippers.  Yea, though thou lie upon the dust,    When they who helped thee flee in fear,  Die full of hope and manly trust,    Like those who fell in battle here!  Another hand thy sword shall wield,    Another hand the standard wave,  Till from the trumpet's mouth is pealed    The blast of triumph o'er thy grave.WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.       *       *       *       *       *HOW SLEEP THE BRAVE.  How sleep the brave who sink to rest  By all their country's wishes blest!  When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,  Returns to deck their hallowed mould,  She there shall dress a sweeter sod  Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.  By fairy hands their knell is rung  By forms unseen their dirge is sung;  There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,  To bless the turf that wraps their clay;  And Freedom shall awhile repair,  To dwell a weeping hermit there!WILLIAM COLLINS.       *       *       *       *       *OUR FALLEN HEROES.  The angel of the nation's peace    Has wreathed with flowers the battle-drum;  We see the fruiting fields increase    Where sound of war no more shall come.  The swallow skims the Tennessee,    Soft winds play o'er the Rapidan;  There only echo notes of glee,    Where gleamed a mighty army's van!  Fair Chattanooga's wooded slope    With summer airs is lightly stirred,  And many a heart is warm with hope    Where once the deep-mouthed gun was heard.  The blue Potomac stainless rolls,    And Mission Ridge is gemmed with fern;  On many a height sleep gallant souls,    And still the blooming years return.  Thank God! unseen to outward eye,    But felt in every freeman's breast,  From graves where fallen comrades lie    Ascends at Nature's wise behest,  With springing grass and blossoms new,    A prayer to bless the nation's life,  To freedom's flower give brighter hue,    And hide the awful stains of strife.  O, Boys in Blue, we turn to you,    The scarred and mangled who survive;  No more we meet in grand review,    But all the arts of freedom thrive.  Still glows the jewel in its shrine,    Won where the James now tranquil rolls;  Its wealth for all, the glory thine,    O memory of heroic souls!GEORGE BANCROFT GRIFFITH.       *       *       *       *       *THE CAUSE OF THE SOUTH.FROM "SENTINEL SONGS."  The fallen cause still waits,--    Its bard has not come yet,  His song--through one of to-morrow's gates    Shall shine--but never set.  But when he comes--he'll sweep    A harp with tears all stringed,  And the very notes he strikes will weep,    As they come, from his hand, woe-winged.  Ah! grand shall be his strain,    And his songs shall fill all climes,  And the Rebels shall rise and march again    Down the lines of his glorious rhymes.  And through his verse shall gleam    The swords that flashed in vain,  And the men who wore the gray shall seem    To be marshalling again.  But hush! between his words    Peer faces sad and pale,  And you hear the sound of broken chords    Beat through the poet's wail.  Through his verse the orphans cry--    The terrible undertone!  And the father's curse and the mother's sigh,    And the desolate young wife's moan.       *       *       *       *       *  I sing, with a voice too low    To be heard beyond to-day,  In minor keys of my people's woe;    And my songs pass away.  To-morrow hears them not--    To-morrow belongs to fame:  My songs--like the birds'--will be forgot,    And forgotten shall be my name.  And yet who knows! betimes    The grandest songs depart,  While the gentle, humble, and low-toned rhymes    Will echo from heart to heart.ABRAM JOSEPH RYAN.       *       *       *       *       *SENTINEL SONGS.  When falls the soldier brave    Dead--at the feet of wrong,--  The poet sings, and guards his grave    With sentinels of song.  Songs, march! he gives command,    Keep faithful watch and true;  The living and dead of the Conquered Land    Have now no guards save you.  Grave Ballads! mark ye well!    Thrice holy is your trust! Go! halt! by the fields where warriors fell,   Rest arms! and guard their dust. List, Songs! your watch is long!   The soldiers' guard was brief, Whilst right is right, and wrong is wrong,   Ye may not seek relief. Go! wearing the gray of grief!   Go! watch o'er the Dead in Gray! Go guard the private and guard the chief,   And sentinel their clay! And the songs, in stately rhyme,   And with softly sounding tread, Go forth, to watch for a time--a time,   Where sleep the Deathless Dead. And the songs, like funeral dirge,   In music soft and low, Sing round the graves,--whilst not tears surge   From hearts that are homes of woe. What though no sculptured shaft   Immortalize each brave? What though no monument epitaphed   Be built above each grave? When marble wears away,   And monuments are dust,-- The songs that guard our soldiers' clay   Will still fulfil their trust.  With lifted head, and steady tread,    Like stars that guard the skies,  Go watch each bed, where rest the dead,    Brave Songs! with sleepless eyes.ABRAM JOSEPH RYAN.       *       *       *       *       *ODE.[Sung on the occasion of decorating the graves of the Confederatedead, at Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, S.C.]  Sleep sweetly in your humble graves,--    Sleep, martyrs of a fallen cause!  Though yet no marble column craves    The pilgrim here to pause,  In seeds of laurel in the earth    The blossom of your fame is blown,  And somewhere, waiting for its birth,    The shaft is in the stone!  Meanwhile, behalf the tardy years    Which keep in trust your storied tombs,  Behold! your sisters bring their tears,    And these memorial blooms.  Small tributes! but your shades will smile    More proudly on these wreaths to-day,  Then when some cannon-moulded pile    Shall overlook this bay.  Stoop, angels, hither from the skies!    There is no holier spot of ground  Than where defeated valor lies,    By mourning beauty crowned!HENRY TIMROD.       *       *       *       *       *THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.[The women of Columbus, Mississippi, strewed flowers alike on thegraves of the Confederate and the National soldiers.]  By the flow of the inland river,    Whence the fleets of iron have fled,  Where the blades of the grave-grass quiver    Asleep are the ranks of the dead;--      Under the sod and the dew,        Waiting the judgment-day;--      Under the one, the Blue;        Under the other, the Gray.  These in the robing of glory,    Those in the gloom of defeat,  All with the battle-blood gory,    In the dusk of eternity meet;--      Under the sod and the dew,        Waiting the judgment-day;--      Under the laurel, the Blue;        Under the willow, the Gray.  From the silence of sorrowful hours    The desolate mourners go,  Lovingly laden with flowers    Alike for the friend and the foe,--      Under the sod and the dew,        Waiting the judgment-day;--      Under the roses, the Blue;        Under the lilies, the Gray.  So with an equal splendor    The morning sun-rays fall,  With a touch, impartially tender,    On the blossoms blooming for all;--      Under the sod and the dew,        Waiting the judgment-day;--      'Broidered with gold, the Blue;        Mellowed with gold, the Gray.  So when the summer calleth,    On forest and field of grain  With an equal murmur falleth    The cooling drip of the rain;--      Under the sod and the dew.        Waiting the judgment-day;--      Wet with the rain, the Blue;        Wet with the rain, the Gray.  Sadly, but not with upbraiding,    The generous deed was done;  In the storm of the years that are fading,    No braver battle was won;--      Under the sod and the dew,        Waiting the judgment-day;--      Under the blossoms, the Blue;        Under the garlands, the Gray.  No more shall the war-cry sever,    Or the winding rivers be red;  They banish our anger forever    When they laurel the graves of our dead!      Under the sod and the dew,        Waiting the judgment-day;--      Love and tears for the Blue,        Tears and love for the Gray.FRANCIS MILES FINCH.       *       *       *       *       *CENTENNIAL HYMN.[1876.]  Our fathers' God! from out whose hand  The centuries fall like grains of sand,  We meet to-day, united, free,  And loyal to our land and Thee,  To thank Thee for the era done,  And trust Thee for the opening one.

Our street is named Providence Road and the house ByrdMansion and I am afraid I'll never be at home there as long as I live.But the doctor says Mother has to live in the country for always, andI'm only glad it isn't any countrier than Byrdsville.The worst thing about it to me is that this house I live in and thetown I live in are named for the lovely dark-eyed girl who lives downin the old-fashioned cottage that backs up on our garden. She movedout for me to move in, just because I am rich and she is poor. I can'tlook at her straight, but I love her so that I can hardly stand it.All the other girls in school love her too, and she is not at allafraid of the boys, but treats them just as if they were human beingsand could be loved as such. That awful long-legged Tony walks homewith her almost every day and they all laugh and have a good time.I always wait until everybody has gone down the street with everybodyelse so they won't see how lonesome I am. Crowded lonesomeness is theworst of all. There are many nice boys and girls just about my agehere in Byrdsville; but they can never like me. I'm glad I found itout before I tried to be friends with any of them. The first day Icame to the Byrd Academy I heard Belle tell Mamie Sue how to treat me,and that is what settled me into this alone state."Of course, be polite to her, Mamie Sue," Belle said, not knowing thatI was behind the hat-rack, pinning on my hat. "But there never was amillionaire in Byrdsville before, and I don't see how a girl who isthat rich can be really nice. The Bible says that it is harder for arich man to get to heaven than for a knitting-needle to stick into acamel, because he and it are blunt, I suppose; and it must be just thesame with such a rich girl. Poor child, I am so sorry for her; but wemust be very careful.""Why, Belle," said Mamie Sue, in a voice that is always so comfortablebecause she is nice and fat, "Roxy said she was going to like her alot, and she's got Roxy's lovely house while Roxy has to live in thecottage, which is just as bad as moving into a chicken coop after theByrd Mansion. If Roxy likes her, it seems to me we might. She didn'tturn us out of house and home, as the almanac says.""Don't you see that Roxy has to be nice to her, because if she isn'twe will think it is spite about the house? Roxy can't show herresentment, but her friends can. I'm a friend."Belle uses words and talks like a grown person in a really wonderfulway. She is the smartest girl in the rhetoric class and, of course,she knows more than most people, and Mamie Sue realizes that. So do I.I saw just how they all felt about me, and I don't blame them--but Ijust wish every time Roxanne Byrd smiles at me that I didn't have tomake myself stop and remember that she does it because she has to."But I believe Phyllis is a nice girl," Mamie Sue said. Mamie Suereminds me of a nice, fat molasses drop, with her yellow hair andalways a brown dress on."The city is an awful wicked place, Mamie Sue, even if it is only justa hundred miles away. Let's don't think about the poor thing." Belleanswered positively, and they went out of the door.I wanted to sit down and cry as I feel sure any girl has a right todo; only I never have learned how to do it. Crying with only agoverness to listen to and reprove a person is no good at all; onlymothers can make crying any comfort, and mine is too feeble to let medo anything but tiptoe in and hold her hand while the nurse watches meand the clock to send me out. Fathers just stiffen girls' backbonesinstead of encouraging wet eyelashes--at least that is the way mineaffects me.No, I didn't sit down and cry when I found out that I wasn't to haveany friends in Byrdsville for the just cause of being too rich, but Istiffened my mind to bear it as a rich man's daughter ought to bearher father's mistakes in conduct.What made me know that the girls had the right view of the questionwas what I had found out about it for myself this spring from readingmagazines, and I have been distressed and uneasy about Father eversince. His own cousin, Gilmore Lewis, who is a fine man, as everybodyknows and as is often published, runs one of the greatest weeklymagazines in New York, and he put a piece in it that would have provedto a child in the second reader how wicked it is to be millionairemen. Father's name was not mentioned, but many of his friends' were,and of course I knew that it was just courtesy of his Cousin Gilmoreto leave it out.I know it is all wrong, with so many poor people and starvation atevery hand. I see that! But in spite of his terrible habit of makingmoney I love and trust my father and expect to keep on doing it. Heunderstands me as well as a man can understand a girl, and he isregardful for me always. He looked at me for a long time one night aweek before he moved down here in this Harpeth Valley, where the airis to keep Mother a little longer for us to know she's here even if wecan't always see her every day, and then he said:"Phil, old girl, I'm not going to take Miss Rogers with us to go onwith your solitary brand of education. There is a little one-horseschool in Byrdsville that they call the Byrd Academy, and I watched abunch of real human boys and girls go in the gate the morning I gotthere. I think you will have to be one of them. I want to see a fewhayseeds sprinkled over your very polished surface."I laughed with him. That is the good thing about Father: you canalways laugh with him, even if you are not sure what you are laughingabout. Laughing _at_ a person is just as rude as eating an appleright in his face. Father always divides his apple. Though rich, he isa really noble man.But although I didn't cry when I heard Belle talking a course ofrighteous action into fat Mamie Sue about me, I made up my mind that Iwould have to have some sort of person to talk to, so I bought thisbook. I am going to call it "Louise" and do as good a stunt ofpretending that it has got brown hair and blue eyes and a real heartas I can. All I have written up to now has just been introducingmyself to Louise. Our real adventures and conversations will comelater.Before I have gone to bed all this week I have been taking a peep outof my window down over the back garden to Roxanne Byrd's cottage andasking her in my heart to forgive me for taking her home, and askingGod to make her love the cottage as I would like to be let to loveher. To think that I have to sleep in her great-grandmother'sfour-poster bed that Roxanne has always slept in! I have to pray hardto be forgiven for it and to be able to endure the doing of it.Good-night!This has been a very curious and happy kind of day, Louise, and I feelexcited and queer. I have had a long talk with Roxanne Byrd over ourgarden fence, and she is just as wonderful as I thought she was goingto be. A person's dream about another person is so apt to be a kind ofmisfit, but Roxanne slipped into mine about her just as if it had beenmade for her.The little Byrd boy is named Lovelace Peyton for his two grandfathers,and he looks and sounds just like he had come out of a beautiful book;but he doesn't act accordingly. He is slim and rosy and dimply, withyellow curls just mopped all over his head, and he has blue eyes thecolor that the sky is hardly ever; but from what Roxanne says abouthim I hardly see how he will live to grow up. He falls in and sits inand down and on and breaks and eats things in the most terriblefashion, and he has all sorts of creeps and crawls in his pocket allof the time. He pulls bugs and worms apart and tries to put themtogether again; and he choked the old rooster nearly to death tryingto poke down his throat some bread and mud made up into pills.That is what I ran to help Roxanne about, and the poor old chicken wasgaping and gasping terribly. I held him while she made Lovelace Peytonput his finger down in the bill and pull up the wad he had been tryingto push down."That old rooster have got rheumatiz, Roxy, and now he'll die with nopill for it," said Lovelace, as he worked his dirty little finger downafter the mud and bread; but he got it out and the poor old chickenhopped off with all his feathers ruffled up and stretching his neck asif to try it."Oh, Lovey, please don't kill the chickens," Roxanne said in a tone ofreal pleading."I don't never kill nothing, Roxy," he answered indignantly. "If athing can't get well from me doctoring it, it dies 'cause it wants to.Since Uncle Pomp let me put that mixtry of nice mud and brick dust onhis shoe he don't suffer with his frost-bit heel no more. He's goingto stop limping next week if I put it on every day. I'm going to poundanother piece of brick right now," and he went around the house withthe darlingest little lope, because he always rides a stick horse,which prances most of the time."Oh, isn't he awful?" said Roxanne; but there was the kind of pride inher voice and the kind of look in her eyes that I would have if I hada little brother like that, even if he was so dirty that he would haveto be handled with tongs."He's so awful I wish he was mine," I answered, and then we bothlaughed.I had never thought, leather Louise, that I would have a nice laughlike that with a girl who was only treating me kindly to keep from thesin of spite. It was hard to believe that Roxanne didn't really likeme when she went on to tell me some of the dreadful funny thingsLovelace Peyton does almost every hour. I forgot about her feeling forme and was laughing at her description of how she came home fromschool one day and found old Uncle Pompey, who is as black and old asa human being can be and is all the servant Roxanne has to help her,cooking dinner with a piece of newspaper pasted in strips all over hisface, which was Lovelace Peyton's remedy for neuralgia.But just as I was enjoying myself so as to be almost unconscious I sawBelle and Mamie Sue and Tony Luttrell coming around the corner of thestreet past the front gate of Byrd Mansion and down toward thecottage. Nobody knows how hard it is for me to see every nice body myown age pass right by my gate in a procession to see Roxanne when Ican't go, too.Tony didn't see me standing by the garden fence, and he gave the funnylittle whistle that he calls the Raccoon whistle for the Palefaces andwhich he always whistles when he wants to signal something to one ofthe girls. Then suddenly they all saw me, and that politely enduringlook came over all three faces at once, though Mamie Sue's face is sojolly and round by nature that it is very hard to prim it downsuddenly, and I don't believe she would always trouble to put it onfor me, only Belle seems to demand it of her as an echo of hersentiments toward me. Some people can't seem to be sure of themselvesunless they can get somebody else to echo them and I think that is whyBelle has to keep poor Mamie Sue at her elbow all the time.But when I saw the politeness plaster spread itself over all theirfaces at the sight of me enjoying myself like any other girl, I justturned away wearily and started back along my own garden path, back tomy own house which I felt that I ought not to be living in. Butsomething sweet happened to me before I left that makes me feel niceand warm even now to think about."Please don't go away, Phyllis," said Roxanne, looking right into myface with such a lovely look in her own eyes that it was almostimpossible, for an instant, for me to believe it was charity.For a moment I wanted to stay, and almost did; but if she could begenerous, so could I, and I didn't intend to spoil their fun for evena minute, so I just smiled at her and bowed to them as I walked away.Nobody knows how it does hurt me to be this kind of an outcast! I havelived fifteen years with a sick mother, and a governess and trainednurses, and never a chance of having friends; and now that one is justat my back door I can't have her because useless wealth is between us.Is there no way the rich can turn poor without disgrace? But I've gotthat smile from Roxanne and I'm going to believe it was meant for thereal me. Good-night!*       *       *       *       *I'm so full of happiness and scare and a secret that if I didn't havethis little book to spill some of it out to I don't know what I woulddo. A secret sometimes makes a girl feel like she would explode worsethan a bottle of nitroglycerin, though it makes me nervous even towrite the word when I think of what might have happened to LovelacePeyton if I hadn't had a father who is cool enough to keep his head atall times and handed that quality down to me.Tony Luttrell is the leader of the Raccoon Patrol of the Boy Scouts,and he has a star for pulling Pink Chadwell out of the swimming-poolone day last summer when Pink had eaten too many green apples and thecold water gave him cramps. Tony had to hit him on the head to keepthem both from being drowned. It was a grand thing for him to do, andeverybody in this town looks up to Tony as a hero. Roxanne says thething that hurts her most is that she can't tell all the boys andgirls how brave I am because of the secret which I had to find outwhen I saved the life of Lovelace Peyton."Oh, Phyllis, to think they can't all know what a noble girl you areto risk your life, when you knew it, to get Lovey out for me," Roxannesaid, after we had locked things up and got Lovelace to promise neverto go near that window again and were sitting on the little back porchof the cottage trembling with fear and being very happy together."I don't care what they think about me, Roxanne, just so you will bemy friend sometimes in private when the others are not around," Isaid, in a voice that wanted to tremble, but I wouldn't let it."Do you think I would do a thing like that, Phyllis--be a girl'sfriend in private?" Roxanne asked, and her head went up into astiff-necked pose like that portrait of her great-grandmother Byrdthat looks so haughtily out of place hanging over the fireplace in theliving hall in the little old cottage, in spite of the room full ofold mahogany furniture and silver candlesticks brought from ByrdMansion to keep her company. "I'm going to be your friend all thetime, and it is none of the others' business. I have always wanted tobe, but you were so stiff with me; and Belle said she felt that youhad so many friends out in the world, where you have traveled, thatyou wouldn't want us."If I had answered what I wanted to about Belle Kirby, I should havebeen very much ashamed by this time. Like a flash it came over me thatit would be a poor way to begin being friends with Roxanne to make hersee what a freak one of her best friends was, so I held the explosionback."She was mistaken, Roxanne," I said; and I couldn't help being alittle sad as I spoke the truth out to her, for I am fifteen yearsold, and fifteen are a good many years to live lonely. "I haven't anyfriends in all the world. We have traveled everywhere trying to getmother well, but I've had no chance to make friends. This is the firsttime a girl ever talked to me in my life, and I never did talk to aboy--and I never want to.""Oh, Phyllis, how dreadful!" said Roxanne; and she gave me such a hugaround the neck that it hurt awfully, only I liked it. It did feelfunny to have somebody sniffing tears of sympathy against your cheek,and I didn't know exactly what to do. Petting has to be learned bydegrees and you can't come to it suddenly. But I was happy.And I'm happier to-night than I ever was in my life, only still scaredquite a little, too. I wonder how the boys and girls are going to likeRoxanne's being friends with me. How can they hate me if I haven'tever done anything to them? It makes me nervous to think about it, andthat combined with the secret and the accident that didn't happen toLovelace Peyton make my writing so shaky that I may never be able toread it.This is the accident and the secret. Of course, I knew that therenever was such a glorious person born in the world as Roxanne's grownbrother, Mr. Douglass Byrd, but I didn't know what kind of a genius hewas. It was something of a shock to find out, for I felt sure he was awonderful poet that the world was waiting to hear sing forth. That iswhat he looks like. He's tall and slim except his shoulders, which arealmost as broad as father's, and his eyes are the night-sky kind thatseem to shine because they can't help it. His smile is as sweet asRoxanne's, only the saddest I ever saw; and his hair mops in curlslike Lovelace Peyton's, only it is black, and he won't let it. Thisdescription could fit a great artist or a novelist or an orator, buthe isn't even any of these; he's an inventor.The invention has something to do with the pig iron out at theCumberland Iron Furnaces that father owns in the Harpeth Valley, andMr. Douglass works for him. It turns it into steel sooner than anybodyelse has ever discovered how to do it before, and it is such awonderful invention that it will make so much money for him and hisfamily that they won't know what to do with it. Roxanne is going totell me more about it to-morrow.I didn't say anything to keep Roxanne from being happy over herbrother getting all that money, but it made me sad. The more money youget the less happiness there seems to be on the market to buy. AllFather's dollars couldn't have bought me even one of those hugs aroundthe neck from Roxanne--I had to risk my life to get them. And that'swhere Lovelace Peyton and his badness come in. I'm catching my breathas I think about it.Mr. Douglass has a little shed down in the cottage garden boxed off tomake his experiments in. He keeps it locked up with a padlock, and hascommanded that nobody is to go even near the door. There is one bigbottle that has some kind of nitroglycerin mixture in it that is goingto blow the iron into steel while it is hot, he hopes. Roxanne knowsit because he showed it to her, and he told her if the cottage evergot on fire to run and get it and carry it carefully away first beforeit could blow up the town. It must never be jolted in any way. She hasa key to the shed that she guards sacredly.If there is one thing in the world that Lovelace Peyton wants worsethan any other, it is bottles. He takes every one he can find and justbegs for more. He has a place down by the garden wall, behind achicken coop, where he makes his mixtures and keeps all the bottles.He's going to be a famous surgeon and doctor some day if he lives,which I now think is doubtful.I was down in my garden on the other side of the wall from him pickingsome leaves off the lavender bushes Roxanne's great-grandmother hadplanted in that lovely old garden, which is so full of Roxanne'sancestral flowers that it grieves me to think I have to own theminstead of her. I haven't been letting myself go down there often,because I was afraid she would suspect how much I wanted her to comeout and talk to me like she did the day of Lovelace Peyton's roosterexcitement; but sometimes I think my dignity ought to let me go andpick just a little of the lavender, and I go. I went this afternoon,and I believe God sent me and so does Roxanne.Suddenly, as I bent over the bushes picking, I heard a wail inRoxanne's sweet voice and I looked up quick. There she stood in theback door, as white as a pocket handkerchief, shuddering and pointingto me to look down at the end of the garden right near me."Oh, Phyllis," she chattered through her shaking teeth just so I couldhear it, "if he drops that big bottle, the whole town will be blown topieces. How can we save it and him?"And when I looked and saw Lovelace Peyton, I began to shudder too. Hewas hanging half in and half out of a little window high up in theshed like a skylight, and the big bottle was slowly slipping as hetried to wriggle either in or out. There was no ladder in sight, andneither of us was near tall enough to reach him. He was beginning towhimper and be scared himself, and I could see the heavy bottle startto slip faster from his arm. We had less than a second to lose. Ithought and prayed both at the same time, which I find is a good thingto do in such times of danger. You haven't got time to do themseparately. The idea came! I have had lots of teaching by differentgymnasium teachers wherever we happened to live for a few months, andI'm as strong as most boys. I know how to do things with myself likeboys do."Hold your bottle tight, Lovelace Peyton; don't let it fall; it'll begood for mixing in and I can get you loose," I called as I scrambledover the wall and met Roxanne just under the window. I saw him hug itup tight again as he stopped squirming."Quick, Roxanne, step on my shoulder," I told her; and I bent down andheld up my hand to her."Oh, can you hold me up, Phyllis?" she gasped; but she put her foot onmy right shoulder and, leaning against the wall, I pulled myself uplittle by little, holding her hand while she clung to the wall tobalance herself."Keep still, Lovey, just a minute longer," she said shakily. "Just aninch more, Phyllis," she whispered to me; and, though I was almoststrained to death, I stretched another inch. Then I heard her give asob and I knew she had the bottle.But even if she did have the bottle we had to get it down without ajar, and I was giving way in every bone in my body. But I thought ofNapoleon Bonaparte and Gen. Robert E. Lee and braced a minute longeras Roxanne climbed down over me with that horrible bottle in her arms.[Illustration: Then Roxanne and the bottle and I all collapsed on thegrass together]Then Roxanne and the bottle and I all collapsed on the grass together;and if we had known how, I think the poetic thing for us to have donewas to have fainted. But we did know how to giggle and shake at thesame time, and that is what we did until Lovelace Peyton howled soloud we had to begin to get him down. And the getting him loose tookus a nice long time that was very good for him. We had to get the keyand unlock the shed and get a table and a chair on both the inside andoutside, and Roxanne pushed while I pulled. We tore him and hisclothes both a great deal, but at last we landed him. Then Roxanne puthim to bed to punish him and to mend his dress at the same time. Thatwas when she told me the great secret that it is hurting me to keep,because it has got my Father mixed up in it in a sort of conspiracylike you read about in books. I don't dare write it even to you,leather Louise.CHAPTER IIChanging a lifelong principle is almost as difficult as wearing newshoes that don't exactly fit you, and it makes you feel just asawkward and limp in mind as the shoes do in feet. Still I believe inadopting new ideas. I have never liked the appearance of boys, and Inever supposed that when you knew one it would be a pleasantexperience; but in the case of Tony Luttrell it is, and in the case ofPink Chadwell it is almost so.I don't know what Roxanne said to them all to explain her relations offriendship with the heathen--myself--but it was funny to see how theytried to please her by seeming to like me, only Tony didn't _seem_. Heoffered me himself as a friend along with all the bites I cared totake off the other side of a huge apple he was eating. I took thebites and Tony at the same time with fear and trembling, but myconfidence in him grows every day. It grows in Pink, also, only muchmore slowly.Tony is long-legged and colty looking, with such a wide mouth andlaughing kind of eyes that the corners of your own mouth go up whenyou look at him, and he raises a giggle in your inside by just a funnykind of flare his eyes have got; but Pink Chadwell is different. PoorPink is so handsome that he is pitiful about it. He carries a bottleof water in his pocket to keep the curl of his front hair sopped out,but he can't keep his lovely skin from having those pink cheeks. Tonycalls him "Rosebud" when he sees that he has got used to hearinghimself called "Pinkie" and is a little happy.The surprise to me was that the boys were so much nicer to me than thegirls when Roxanne adopted me; but then it didn't make so muchdifference to them. The girls are always together in all of theimportant things of their lives, while most of the time the boys justforget all about us, unless they need us for something or we get aheadof them in class."I'm so glad that you are going to stay and have lunch with usto-day," Belle said to me the first time I let Roxanne beg me intobringing my lunch instead of going home for it, as I had been doingevery day to keep from seeming to be so alone, eating all by myselfwhile they had spread theirs all together out on the side porch oreven out on the big flat stone when it was warm enough. "When Roxywanted to invite you, I felt sure you wouldn't come."Some people have a way of freezing up all the pleasure that they canget close enough to talk over. Belle is that kind. She made me souncomfortable that I was about to do some freezing on my own accountwhen Mamie Sue lumbered into the conversation in such a nice, friendlyway that I laughed instead."I hope you brought a lot of food, for I'm good and hungry to-day,"she said. "I ate so many biscuits for breakfast that I left myselfonly five to bring for lunch. Our cook makes the same number every dayand I just see-saw my lunch and breakfast in a very uncomfortable way.So many biscuits for breakfast, so few for lunch!" That jolly, plumplaugh of Mamie Sue's is going to save some kind of a serious situationyet, friend leather Louise.If you are the kind of person that has dumb love for your friends, yousee more about them than folks who can express themselves on thesacred subject. That lunch party with those five jolly girls out inthe side yard of the Byrd Academy gave me a funny, uneasy feeling, andI now know the reason. Roxanne Byrd brought one small apple, two verythin biscuits, and some cracked hickory nuts. She carefully ate lessthan she brought. Something took my appetite when I saw her eat solittle, and there was a quantity of food left for somebody to consume,and _she_ hungry. I was afraid we'd have to send for a doctor forMamie Sue after she had cleared my large napkin we spread to put itall on. The Jamison biscuits are cut on the same plump pattern thatMamie Sue is and all my sandwiches were good and thick.But when Roxanne didn't eat I suffered. One of the most awfulsituations in life is to have one of your friends be the sort of girlthat has a town named after her and wonderful family portraits andsuch dainty hands and feet that shabby shoes don't even count, andthen to know that she is hungry most of the time from being too poorto get enough food. For two days I have had to keep my mind offRoxanne Byrd to make myself swallow one single morsel of anything toeat. I suspected it at the school lunch but I was certain of it fromthe way Lovelace Peyton consumed the first cooky I offered him overthe fence. Thank goodness, he has no family pride located in hisstomach, and when my feelings overcome me he is the outlet. I can feedhim anything at all hours and he is always ready for more. It may bewrong to keep it from his sister when I know how she feels about it,but I can't help that. I have to fill him up. His legs look too emptyfor me.But, to do Lovelace Peyton justice, he has got his own kind of pride,and I understand it better than I do Roxanne's."For these nice eatings, I'll cut a cat open for nothing and let yousee inside what makes him go, if you get the cat," he offered, afterhe had eaten two slices of buttered bread and the breast of half achicken out behind one of the lilac bushes in his ancestral gardenthat is now mine.Now, I call that a fair proposition, considering the circumstances,and I wish I could make Roxanne be as sensible in spirit. But I can't.Family pride is a terrible thing, like lunacy or hysterics when aperson gets it bad.However, I decided to talk to Roxanne about her financial situation,and I began as far off from the subject as I could, so as to approachit with caution.I made a start with a compliment. A sincere compliment is a good wayto start being disagreeable to a person for her own benefit."Roxanne," I said, with decided palpitation in my heart that I keptout of my voice, "you didn't know, did you, that you are onefifteen-year-old wonder, done up in a feminine edition with curls anddark eyes? How do you manage it all?""I'm not, and I don't," answered Roxanne with a laugh as she drew along needle across a mammoth darn she was making on the knee of astocking which was quite as small as the darn was large. "I don'tmanage at all; everybody will tell you so. Miss Prissy Talbot says shecan't get to sleep at night until twelve o'clock because she has topray about so many things that might happen to us poor forlorns if shedidn't. I am mighty thankful to her, for I don't have time to praymuch. I am so tired when I go to bed. I just say 'God, you know,' andgo to sleep. He understands, 'cause Miss Prissy has told him all aboutit beforehand.""I just guess He does--without Miss Talbot's telling Him either," Ianswered as I came and sat on the front steps beside Roxanne. "Andanother thing, Roxanne--I--er, I don't quite know how to say it--butyou--you talk like you are--that is, you seem to be friends with Godjust like you are with Tony Luttrell and Belle and Miss Prissy and theColonel--and me," I continued with embarrassment."I am," answered Roxanne, with beautiful positiveness. "I decided tohave Him for one of my friends 'most two years ago after Father andMother died almost together. When Douglass told me that we would haveto sell Byrd Mansion and move down here in this old cottage that hadbeen great-grandfather's gardener's house, with only Uncle Pompey tohelp me take care of it and him and Lovelace Peyton, he asked me if Icouldn't stand by. I held my head up just as high as great-grandmotherByrd does in her portrait and said: 'Yes!' 'Then God help you,' hesaid, and he hugged me up under his chin. Then we all moved; and God_has_ helped.""He must have," I answered devoutly, meaning what I said. And as Ispoke something in me was loosened and I felt a wonderful differenceabout God. The God that a governess explains out of a book to you andthe One that really comes down and helps a girl friend so that she canspeak of Him with confidence as a friend, are two distinct people. Iam going to feel about Him as Roxanne does and speak of Him when Iwant to and write about Him to you, Louise, just as I do about all ofthe other interesting inhabitants of Byrdsville."Oh," laughed Roxanne, as she snipped a thread and began tocross-stitch the mammoth cavern, never dreaming of the momentousresolve she was interrupting in my heart, "it is not so bad this year,because Lovey has got so nice and steady on his feet and doesn't putthings in his mouth any more. Now he is so busy hunting and doctoringhis 'squirms' as he calls them, that I have lots of free time to mendand darn and work. Of course, it is hard to have him keep them in hisapron pocket and always carrying them in his hand when he hasn't abottle that smells bad to carry. Just yesterday he brought a queerkind of--Oh, what do you suppose he has found now?"And with the fear and trembling that all girls have the right to feelof "squirms" both Roxanne and I sat petrified while Lovelace Peytoncame around the house at full gallop and drew up in front of us on thebrick walk. His face was streaked with mud, and in one hand he held anold tomato can and in another a dangerous-looking pointed stick.Lovelace Peyton is freckled and snub-nosed and patched in variousunexpected places and his eyes were sweet like Roxanne's as theyflared with excitement when he paused for breath before he unfoldedhis tale of the adventure from which he had just arrived."Guess what crawl I have founded now, Roxy?" he demanded withconfidence that sympathy would be extended him over his good-fortune."I can't guess, Lovey, but please don't let it out," answered Roxannewith the expected sympathy slightly tinged with entreaty in her voice.I moved down one step so as to be nearer the capture, for LovelacePeyton's enthusiasm was contagious."It's a chicken sk-snake," he proclaimed proudly; and while bothRoxanne and I tucked our feet up under our skirts and squealed, hedrew with triumph a very fat, red fishing-worm out of the can anddisplayed it, hanging across one of his chubby fingers. "It's a lovelychicken-eating sk-snake," he said with breathless admiration."Y-e-s," I said doubtfully. "But it couldn't eat a chicken very well,could it, Lovelace Peyton?" I asked politely, with my doubts of thehelpless red string hanging on his finger well under control. Roxannehad gone back to her darning with relief plainly written all over herface."This sk-snake could eat up five chickens or maybe more if you givehim time," defended his captor warmly."It--it looks rather small to be so savage, Lovey," argued Roxannemildly as she went on darning."It's sick some--wait till I put it in pepper tea," said LovelacePeyton as he lifted the worm."Ask Uncle Pomp what he thinks," advised Roxanne, hoping to get rid ofthe squirm."I bet Uncle Pomp will be skeered to death of him," answered the proudhunter as he took his departure around the house."Oh," sighed Roxy, "some day he will find a real snake and then whatwill I do?""That is just what I was talking about, Roxanne," I said, returning tomy subject, which is the way my slow, methodical mind works in directcontrast to Roxanne's way of forgetting one thing because ofenthusiastic interest in the next. "I don't see how you attend to allof this, this--" I paused to find a name for Roxanne's tumultuoushousehold."Menagerie," Roxanne suggested, with a laugh that floated out over thebed of ragged red chrysanthemums as sweet and clear as the note of thecardinal in the tall elm by the gate."It's how you get your lessons and stay high up in your class I don'tunderstand," I answered, still using my compliment tactics. "I've onlyknown you less than a month, so it might be just luck that you gotfirst mention for your character sketch of Hawthorne in the rhetoricclass; but Tony says you always get it. You recite your German poemslike they were English, and you feel them as much as you doCassabianca. When do you study?""Never," answered Roxy with a ruthful smile; "but, Phyllis, in schoolI listen. I have to. Just school hours are all I have; but I learnlessons while they are being recited, and write exercises and thingsin that one free hour I have at ten o'clock. If nothing like mumps orwhooping-cough happens to Lovey this winter or next, I believe I willbe ready to go to college with you and Belle and Mamie Sue and Tonyand Pink. I've asked Miss Prissy to be sure and pray away those mumpsand whooping-cough. I could manage measles.""But you are just one girl, Roxanne, with the usual number of handsand feet and eyes and things," I said, with an intention of bringingthings to the point of the embarrassing hunger. But my point wasreached in the conversation by Roxanne herself without my being quiteready for it."Yes, I know that, but for a little while I have got to be several,"she answered with a laugh. "Douglass has succeeded in the experimentsout there in the back yard, but he can't be certain of the processuntil he tries it on a whole oven full of ore some night out at thefurnaces. He just works every minute he can get, all night sometimes,and that is why I mend and darn and save and save--it costs so muchfor him to get the things he needs out in his shop. Of course, I neverlet Lovey or Uncle Pomp get really hungry, but Douglass and I do--thatis--" Roxanne stopped, for the pain _would_ come out on my face."Oh, Phyllis, not really hungry," she said mercifully, "but just tiredof corn-bread and molasses. Douglass kisses me and I kiss him good-byin the morning and we pretend it is butter on his bread, like the poetsaid. Please don't feel bad about it, Phyllis. It was cruel for me totell it when I am as happy as I can be.""Well, you'll never be hungry again while I have two feet and hands to'tote' food to you, as Uncle Pompey calls it," I answered with amasterly control of that troublesome lump in my throat that I haddiscovered for the first time since I began to love Roxanne Byrd."I couldn't let you do that--bring me food, Phyllis," said Roxannegently; and her little head with its raven black, heavy curls againrose to the stately pose of the Byrd great-grandmother."I don't see why not," I answered bluntly."Taking food and clothes would be charity, and I couldn't do that. Icouldn't even let Miss Prissy give Lovelace Peyton any aprons, only Idid take some scraps of her pink gingham dress to piece himwith--that's why he looks like such a rainbow with his pink on blue.Please don't be mad with me, Phyllis. I don't mind at all doingwithout grand things to eat, but I can't--can't do without your--yourlove," and Roxanne hid her head on my shoulder, much to my surprise."You'd better have my cookies and roast chicken," I muttered as Ishook her back into her own place again."The taste of love lasts longer than any kind of cake," answeredRoxanne with a comforted laugh. "And truly, Phyllis, it has been acomfort to tell you all about it. It is hard to have to skimp like Ido and it makes a girl nervous to have to keep looking down at herfeet to be sure that a toe isn't poking out of the shoe since the lasttime she looked, also to know that the last inch of hem is let out ofher dress and her legs are growing while she sleeps. I can takeDouglass's old shirts and make shirt waists for me and aprons of thescraps for Lovey, and lots of things for Lovey out of his oldtrousers, only he says that he has to wear them himself until he feelsashamed of his appearance whenever he meets anybody; but my own skirtsare what seem the last straw, or rather the bricks that I haven't anystraw to make. The last one was made out of some dead Somebody Byrd'sblack cashmere shawl, I don't know whose, but I can't see the nexteven in the dim future.""I heard Belle Kirby say that your white linen is the most stylishdress in Byrdville, and I agreed with her," I said, with the emphasisthat truth always makes possible. "In fact, you always look differentfrom other people, Roxanne--like--like the town was named for you--asit is.""Oh, that linen dress is really a wonder, considering," laughedRoxanne with pleased delight. "It is made out of a linen sheet thatcame off one of my great-grandmother's looms, and I found it in an oldtrunk. Miss Prissy embroidered it and helped me make it and a suit forLovey and a shirt for Douglass out of the other one of the pair. UnclePompey helps me wash and iron all three of them every Saturday. He hasa necktie off of them, too, and Sunday we all go to church 'of apiece', he calls it. Douglass says, when the Emperor of Germanyinvites the great inventor and his family to come to court to meet theroyal family we are all going to wear our parts of the family sheets,if only folded in our pockets like handkerchiefs. Sometimes in themiddle of the night, when something goes right in the shop, Douglasscomes in and wakes me up. I dress up in a blanket for a court dress,and we wake up Lovey and play our royal visit. Do you blame me for notminding washing and ironing and cooking and toe-poking ordress-shrinking with a brother who is an idol like that?""No, Roxanne, I don't blame you. He--er--Mr. Douglass is worth itall," I answered with controlled emotion. I thereupon adopted the word"Idol" to use for him in private between you and me, good Louise. Hedeserves it. "He is so perfectly grand that I step on my own toeswhenever I see from a long way off that I must meet him on thestreet," I continued. "I turn a corner rather than speak to him. Inever intend to. The sight of him makes me so shy that it is agony." Ididn't in the least mind confessing such a feeling to Roxanne, becauseshe is the "Idol's"--it looks nice written--sister and willunderstand."And all the time he is afraid that he will have to back up against afence sometime to hide his patches from you," laughed Roxanne in suchmerriment that anybody with any sense of pleasant humor would havejoined her at the thought of the Idol and me dancing a minuet to keepout of each other's way.The way Roxanne feels about her brother is the way I feel about Fathereven after I saw that article in the magazine. He is my father andnobody is wholly bad. I always will love him devotedly and go to himwith my sorrows.At night in the study of Roxanne's forefathers, before the log firewhere the fifth old Colonel Byrd used to entertain Andrew Jackson, Itold him all about that terrible starving that is going on down at thelittle cottage beyond the garden."Well," said Father, in the voice I still think so noble and good andthat still comforts me, "we'll have to see to all that. When I boughtthis place from young Byrd, I liked him better than any youngster Ihad met in a long time, and I offered him a better place out at thefurnaces than he could fill. I have tried to have him advanced twice,but the young stiffneck says he won't have more than he earns. Stillhe gets a hundred a month and things ought not to be so tight down atthe Byrd nest. Wonder what he does with the money? He's not a gamer, Itake it.""Oh, Father, no!" I answered, shocked that anybody should think thatof the Idol. "It's for the experiments that all the money goes.Roxanne's so proud of him for the wonderful thing he has discoveredthat she will starve herself to death, and him too, before all theworld hears about it, even the Emperor of Germany.""Experiments?" Father asked, with a quick look that he has whenbusiness and things interest him very much. "What experiments?""I can't tell you that, for you're the very person not to know," Ianswered quickly, a little bit scared."Then don't," answered Father, looking me square in the face in a waythat I wished that magazine could have seen. "And if you have a secretof importance, don't ever even hint it, Phil.""I won't," I answered, glad to see that he wasn't going to ask anymore about it all."And, Phil," he continued, speaking slowly and looking at me aslovingly as any father could look at a daughter, even a poor one, "yougo right ahead filling up the youngster and standing by the Byrds.That's what I want you to learn--standing-by-ness. Have the other'poor but prouds' thawed to you to any extent?" I had told Father someof the ways Belle and the others had treated me, only not so as tohurt his feelings about his money being the cause of it."Some of them have and the others are going to, I think," I said, evenmore hopefully than I really felt about it."Here's hoping," said Father, and this time he did laugh.A great resolve has come into my mind since this talk with Father. Iam going to reform him about money-making if it takes me all my life.He is too good a man for God not to have in heaven. His honor must besaved. Amen!CHAPTER IIIMiss Priscilla Talbot might by some people be called an old maid, asshe must be either a little before or after fifty years old; but if Ihad to invent just one word to describe her darling self it would be"precious."Tony Luttrell calls all of the girls collectively and singly"bubbles," which is both disrespectful and funny at the same time. Butreal affection in any disrespect can keep it from being at allwicked--and Tony's always is affectionate, especially when he insultsMiss Priscilla by calling her Miss Bubbles right to her face. Nobodyelse dares to do it, but she likes it. It is a good thing that she isfifty years young instead of old, for if she wasn't I don't know whatthe Palefaces and Scouts would do without her. She lets Tony beg herinto doing everything with us so the grown-up people, like mothers andfathers, will be deceived into thinking that we are being taken careof, while the truth is that Miss Prissy is just as much trouble for usto look after as Lovelace Peyton and we love her in exactly the sameway. We also love the Colonel a great deal for her sake, and to makeup for the way she treats him.Miss Prissy lives just next to Roxanne, on the other side, and she issuch a comfort to her, though a great added responsibility. Sheworries so over everything that Roxanne doesn't have that it gets onRoxanne's nerves, as the people say when things make them cross. Notthat Roxanne ever is cross with Miss Prissy. But I made up my mindafter that first remonstrance that if Roxanne Byrd had the pluck tolet herself go hungry and cold and ragged for a great proud cause likean inventor in the family, I was going to let her get all the fun outof it she could and not mope over it. I still fill up Lovelace Peytonso regularly that he is getting so fat I am afraid Roxanne will noticeand suspect something. I may have to diet him soon.Roxanne and I were just talking about Miss Prissy and the poor Colonelout on the front steps of the cottage when there came one of the proudmoments of my life. It's wonderful how Roxanne's enthusiasm can throwsuch a magic over her shabby shoes and the little cottage with theyoung green vines running over the eaves and old Uncle Pomp and adarning bag full of ragged stockings, that you want to stay feeling itforever and ever. It doesn't even take the rosy hue off the dream totalk about Lovelace Peyton."Oh, Lovey will be a famous surgeon some day, I feel sure," Roxannesaid, as she began on another interminable job of stocking-patching."And Douglass is going to be a Supreme Judge of the United Stateswhile I help him. Just as soon as the money comes we shall all go tocollege, Lovey, Douglass, Uncle Pomp and I, to get ready for our lifework.""What course will Uncle Pompey take?" I couldn't help asking, becauseUncle Pompey is so old he couldn't learn to turn one of his own battercakes the wrong way around."Domestic Science," Roxanne laughed back at her own self; and justthen Tony came in with his pie catastrophe that caused so muchtrouble."You two hubbies, you had better lay aside the darning-needle andseize the pie plate," he said, fanning himself with Roxanne'sscissors. "We've just decided in Scout Council to take the Palefacesout to the Harpeth ridge to hunt spring shoots and roots, and wealways count on you for pies, Roxy, Stocking-darner.""How lovely, Tony!" exclaimed Roxanne, rising right above the pieswhich sank my heart like lead to think of her having to furnish; andwhere would she get them? I was so dismayed that I never thought ofbeing embarrassed about being left out, as I, of course expected tobe; and so it came as a proud surprise when Tony asked me, in thenicest way a boy could think of, to go with them. That is, he didn'task me, but ordered me what to bring like I had been going on theRaccoon outings since infancy."You are to bring a white mountain cake in a cocoanut snowstorm, CityBubbles," he said, with that funny flare of his eyes that always setsme laughing inside whether I want to or not. "Belle is brewingsandwiches and Mamie Sue is croquetting with some chicken. Don't tellthe dumpling, but we are going to rub asafetida on her shoes and leaveher to rest on a stone so as to lose her good and then find her bysmelling her track like true Scouts. Now, don't spoil a single pie,Roxy; we'll need all six.""I won't, I won't," answered Roxanne; and I saw that grandmother posebegin to come to her head and I knew that it meant that she wouldshake six pies out of that empty larder like the widow in the Bibledid the meal. "Did you ask Miss Prissy, Tony?" she asked, as if tochange the subject for an instant's relief."I did," answered Tony with a laugh; "and Miss Bubbles said she wouldgo accompanied by a basket of stuffed eggs to return accompanied by abunch of stuffed Scouts. We also asked the Colonel, and he made us aspeech of acceptance twenty minutes long, Pink and me. But I musthurry along and encourage Mamie Sue not to eat all the chicken tastiesas she makes them. Do you two Palefaces promise to rustle around assoon as I go?""We do," we both answered as he went out of the gate. Then we satstill, paralyzed, instead of the promised rustling. Only I was themost upset. Roxanne always brings out the rainbow and shakes it whenthe clouds get down very low."What are you going to do about the pies?" I asked, forgetting mypromise to myself never to force Roxanne to look any kind of problemin the face as long as she could keep her back to it."Well," she answered so placidly that I felt ashamed of myself, "Ihave just been thinking those apples up. I can starve Lovey and myselfenough to get the things for the crust, but where are the apples tocome from? Won't it be fun to look back from richness and rememberwhen an apple looked as big as one of the Harpeth Hills?""But, haven't you got any apple plan at all?" I again forgot myresolve and asked. I'm often ashamed of myself for being so practicalabout things, but I can't help it, and I couldn't see those piescoming down on a rainbow. She had to have the apples to save herfamily pride, and apples don't grow on dream trees."Not a plan," she answered, snipping a thread with a steady hand. "Butthey'll come from some place. Now, I've got to think up stories tomake Lovey forget that he wants anything but some corn-bread andbuttermilk for supper. That'll save the batter-cake flour for thepie-crust and some of the lard and butter too. If I can amuse him pastbreakfast with just corn meal mush, I'll have enough flour for themall. Uncle Pompey has lots of spice and things, so it'll only be theapples. Maybe I can--""Wait a minute, I've got a plan!" I exclaimed quickly; for beingRoxanne's friend often makes me need to think very quickly indeed."You go on believing they'll come, and your believing and my plan willbe almost sure to get them. I'll have to go home right now.""Your plan won't make me have to--to let anybody give them to me, willit, Phyllis?" And Roxanne's eyes were so soft with entreaty to sparethat family pride that I had to swallow the inconvenient lump in mythroat again. I wish my eyes knew how to mist with tears like a girl'sought to do instead of my choking up like a boy. But I had my voicegood and steady by the time I got opposite Father across his officetable."And so," he said, as he looked at me with an expression I feel onmyself when I am going to take hold of some of the knots in Roxanne'saffairs, "I am to buy two barrels of apples here in the spring whenthey are gold nuggets, and help you pack up ten baskets of them for meto send to the furnace office force as a seasonable compliment, justso that stiff-necked young Byrd can carry his family pride along homein the basket with the apples for the making of six pies. Rightexpensive pies, those!""Yes, Father, I know they are," I answered firmly but pathetically."But I told you Lovelace Peyton and Roxanne are starving to save thecrust; and my friends' troubles are mine. When he gets the chance toprove that steel explosion thing and people buy the process from him,they won't need friends, or rather they will need friends more thanthey ever did, with all that money, but they won't need apples. I'msorry it is being such an expensive thing for me to have a friend, butI must stand by her now if you will let me.""Steel!" said Father, and his eyes went into narrow slits in a way Idon't like, because he forgets I'm living. And he was in one of thosespells of turning himself inside himself to think, when I glanced atRogers, his foreman at the furnaces, who was going over some papers atanother desk. And as I glanced at him Father came out of his insideand looked at him too. I never did like Mr. Rogers."Rogers," said Father briskly, "go telephone the Hill Grocery Companyto pack up ten large baskets of apples and send them over to theoffice. You go over and give them to the boys and cover up MissPhyllis's track effectually by a speech of presentation. And remember,Rogers, that whatever Miss Phyllis says in my office is strictlybusiness and is to be observed as absolutely confidential."As Rogers went out of the door I felt my heart sink in a queer way,and I turned to find Father looking at me sternly."Phil," he said, in the tone of voice I feel sure fathers use to theirerrant sons, "if you have another person's secret to guard, do itcarefully and do not let the excitement of the moment make you let itslip.""Oh, Father," I fairly gasped, "did I tell you anything about Mr.Douglass's secret that I ought not?""You told about all you know, daughter; but fortunately you didn'tknow enough to do much damage. I happen to know I can trust Rogers asmyself. Now, go to your pie fixings, for I'm unusually busy."I turned to the door with a queer sinking feeling coming up in me whenhe called me back again."Of course, Phil, you know what a pleasure it is to me for you toshower apples on the Byrds and others, and I want to speak to youabout a little matter that is troubling me and ask your help. We havegot to spend some money in Byrdsville, and you must help me to do it.I can't get Henri to buy his supplies for the kitchen here, under anycircumstances--he shrugs his French shoulders, gives me two uneatablemeals, and orders from New York as usual. I can't very well wearByrdsville clothes myself, and there seems no way to drop cash in thetown unless you can find some way. Buy things at all the stores andcharge them to me. Give away and use what you can, but _buy_. Weowe it to the town and we must do it. Can you promise to take part ofthe job for me?""I'll try, Father," I answered doubtfully. "I like the kind of clothesthe girls wear, so I will get mine in the stores, and I can givepresents to all who will allow it.""That's it--presents--presents to your friends," said Father in arelieved tone of voice, and I could see that he had no idea of theburden he had put on my shoulders. "Now fade away, and let me work,kiddie. You are all to the good!"As I walked along home my heart was so heavy down in my toes that myfeet almost stuck to the pavement--not only about the task of spendingthe money, but about the secret. However, I reasoned it up into mybreast again. If my father is one of the men that magazines writeagainst and say is too rich to be good, he has always told me thetruth; and when he said I hadn't done the great secret any damage Ibelieved him. If he can trust Rogers as himself, I can, too.But after this, when I know anything that all the world can't know I'mgoing to wear a horsehair ring, like Belle makes Mamie Sue do, toremind me not to forget and tell. I thought I was stronger-minded thanthat, but I see I'm not. You see, leather Louise, I must be moretrustworthy than just any girl; for if I'm untrustworthy, then it willbe a tragedy, because it will prove that I inherited it and so be anevidence against Father in my own mind and the world's too.Since I have been with Roxanne so much, and seen so many things whichprove that God is looking directly after her, as my getting the appleplan shows, I feel so much nearer to Him. I am going to pray to Him tohelp me to help Father, and take both our honors in His keeping. Amen!Goodnight!Of course, the whole spring keeps springing wonderful days on aperson, each one lovelier than the last; but the one that came downfrom over Old Harpeth, as the tallest hump on the ridge is called, wasso lovely that it was hard to believe that I was not just seeing itwith Roxanne's eyes. If it was so beautiful, with its orchard smellsand blooms and buzzing of bees and soft little winds, to me, I wonderwhat it did look like to _her_. And to think that Roxanne wasalmost in tears before it was nine o'clock.The interurban that runs by Byrdsville and out over the ridge to thecity has cars only every two hours, so if we didn't catch theeight-ten one, we couldn't go until the ten-ten, and that would makeit very late for the Scouts to go through all the kinds of drills theyhad planned for. Some of us had to sprain ankles and make believe tostep on snakes, and then Mamie Sue had to be lost and traced, only shedidn't know it yet; so Tony said that we would have to start veryearly. It was about half past seven when he came for me while all therest of them waited at the corner for us. We then trooped down to getRoxanne and Lovelace Peyton; but disaster met us at the door. It wasLovelace Peyton dancing and yelling like a wild Indian while Roxannetried to quiet him and unbutton his white linen dress-up at the sametime."Please everybody go on. We can't come," Roxanne called to us at thegate. "Lovey sat down on one of the hot pies that Uncle Pomp had justtaken out of the stove for me to put in the basket, and it burned himthrough his trousers and blouse and all. Uncle Pomp has got a dreadfulfit of asthma, and the pie is all over everything where Lovey ranaround and around. I've got to scrub him and the whole house. Pleasego on and don't be late for the train." And as Roxanne looked out atus over the dancing Lovelace Peyton that was the first time I had everseen her face without its dimple on the left side of her chin, or herhead down out of the rosy cloud."It always happens just this way, Roxy," said Belle in a reprovingtone of voice. "You promised to begin to get ready last night, so asnot to delay anything or anybody. We're just not going to wait!""I did try, Belle," answered Roxanne, with a little sob coming intoher voice that made both Tony and me so mad at one time that it is awonder that we didn't both explode together."Here, you bubbles," said Tony, jumping the gate as I went through it,"get busy with this situation. We've got almost a half-hour, so bedoing something, everybody. Belle, you help Roxy skin that kid and gethim into clean clothes while I swab up and light old Pomp'sjimson-weed pipe for him?" And as Tony spoke he started to the rear ofthe house."No, no. I'm hurted bad, and I won't let anybody but Phyllis touch me.I'll out off Belle's arm if she comes nigh me," said Lovelace Peytonin the rudest voice; but it did me good to get hold of him and beginto peel him while Roxanne stood petrified at the idea of hurrying allher calamities onto the car in twenty minutes."Oh, I'm not dressed and the pies are not packed and--" began Roxanne,but the dimple also began to play at the same time."I'll help you dress, Roxanne," said Belle meekly; for Belle is moreafraid of Tony's explosions than of anything else on earth, and he hadlooked at her with a stern expression as she had fussed at andthreatened to leave Roxanne."I'll pack the pies," said Mamie Sue, with plain delight at theprospect."Well, hurry, Dumpling, and don't take a bite out of a stray corner ofmore than half those pies," Tony answered her as he rolled up hisshirt sleeves and started toward the kitchen. All the other members ofthe Raccoon Patrol were with the other girls at the station, andnobody could go without Tony, who had bought the combination ticketfor everybody, at a bargain.It is all very well to say that "haste makes waste," but there is akind of hurry that gets things done, and Tony knows how to put thatkind into action. He and Mamie Sue kept to the kitchen as their sceneof operations, and before we knew it old Uncle Pomp was seated humpedover his pipe and beginning to breathe easy. Mamie Sue had hoppedaround to keep out of the swirls of Tony's mop while she packed thoseill-fated but precious pies in the basket, and she was breathingalmost as hard as Uncle Pompey.I did the best I could with Lovelace Peyton, though only the blueapron with the largest pink patches was whole and clean; so he had togo that way, which I know hurt Roxanne, for he had been so lovely tolook at in his part of the grandmother's sheet.Belle was buttoning Roxanne's festive white linen up the back as Tonycame down the hall shooing panting Mamie Sue with the basket in frontof him, and collected us all. I grabbed Roxanne's hat from the closetfor her and swung Lovelace Peyton up on Tony's shoulder so he couldrun on ahead with him. Belle followed Roxanne, buttoning her up allthe way to the front gate, while Mamie Sue trundled along steadilywith the two baskets.I've heard about the excitements of the city and the quiet of thecountry, but I have the opinion that the terms in this case are mixed.We all fell aboard the car half dead, but we caught it!I'm not going to describe this Scout outing in detail to you, myleather-bound Louise, because it would take all night. I'm so tiredthat I doubt if I get up in the morning until it is afternoon, butthere are a few high lights I will mention because I never want toforget them. A girl wants to keep the details of the first happiestday of her life always, even if she has many others.Mamie Sue got lost satisfactorily, but they forgot she had Belle'sbasket with her, and when they found her some of the sandwiches werelost forever; but Mamie Sue was happy. It was wonderful the way Pinktracked her shoes by the asafetida. That is one of the reasons Scoutscan't smoke: they must keep their sense of smell to track things with.One of the Willis girls let Sam Hayes treat her for snake-bite by therules of the book and never said a word; but then neither one of thoseWillis girls ever says anything except what they have to in classroom,and we like them immensely. They are Tony's first cousins and both areof the first families of Byrdsville.But the sensation of the day was when Tony really fell and skinned hisarm bad--and what do you think he did? He let Lovelace Peyton do allthe things to it that he showed him how to do out of the book. I neversaw any human being in my life so happy as that little patched boywas, and it was marvelous how he understood just what Tony said anddid it quicker than any of us could. His slender little fingers workedlike a grown-up's."Oh, if his father, the doctor, could have just seen him," said MissPrissy in such a sweetly sympathetic voice that the Colonel blew hisnose. He was Roxanne's father's best friend, and had watched him cutup what was left of people on the battle-field in the Civil War. Hetold us all about it. I feel that we must take better care of LovelacePeyton, but I am sorry for Roxanne to have two geniuses in her familyto watch over. It is such a responsibility and requires even more ofmy help.The luncheon was a success. Everybody ate everything, especially thegreat surgeon and Mamie Sue. The dried sticks made the sparks on theleaves for Pink so much to his pride that Tony had to call him Rosebudto keep him cool, he said, and Sam's kettle hung on the forked sticksthe first time and boiled the best potatoes I ever tasted.The boys signaled to the Colonel by the Scout language and he got thesignals perfectly. Then he told them war tales until time to starthome. He carried Lovelace Peyton, who had gone to sleep on the car,home in his arms, while Miss Prissy walked behind him with Roxanne. Iwonder why Miss Prissy doesn't want to marry such a grand man as theColonel is?But a strange thing happened to Tony and me as we came by the sidewall of our garden after we had taken the quiet Willises home and hewas bringing me to my front gate. It makes me nervous to think aboutit. That secret about the steel, which is going to keep Roxanne fromliving in such poverty, weighs on my mind so that I never forget it.It is right out there in the little shed and it is both dangerous andprecious.Suddenly Tony stopped me right opposite the shed and gave the Scoutsignal of warning."Tip-hist-toe," he said under his breath. "Did you see a shadow dodgebehind Roxy's cottage just a minute ago, Phyllis?" he asked, in awhisper that was enough to make almost any girl's blood run cold inher body."I did," I answered him in just as blood-curdling a whisper, "butUncle Pompey goes out to see after his hens just about this time everynight. I think that was the shadow.""Of course," Tony laughed in a human voice again. "Say Phyllis, youare one brick, a yard wide, all wool, and a foot thick. There are notthe usual bubble squeals in you." I never was so confused in all mylife. I don't know how to answer people when they express a liking forme, because I have never had many compliments passed on me."Thank you, Tony," I said, just as humbly as I felt, which was veryhumble indeed."Now, Phyllis, I wasn't patting any Fido on the head," Tony laughed ina funny way; for what I said had teased him, though I don't know justwhy. "And also I didn't say that to you because you didn't yelp when Iscared up a bogie for you, but because I saw how you came near beatingme to Roxy's catastrophes this morning when Belle wanted to give herthe jolly go-by. Old Roxanny has some rough going at times, and it isgood to know that she has got a bubble next door to stand by her in astocking-darning way a fellow can't. Good-night!"Tony Luttrell is an honorable gentleman, if he is just in shorttrousers yet, and I appreciate his friendship.That shadow _will_ make me uneasy. I feel like that cross, nervouswhite hen of Uncle Pompey's, only as if I were sitting on dynamitebottles instead of eggs. I will and do trust my father, but can Itrust him to trust Rogers? Oh, I wish he was just a lawyer with almostno practice, like Tony's father, and was sitting in the office all daylong doing nothing, where I knew he was, instead of going back andforth from the city with other men that have more money than it isright to have! I'd even be willing to have him keep the grocery storeeven if it did mean that he wasn't quite as first-family as JudgeLuttrell and the Byrds.Oh, I do love my father--I do--I do!CHAPTER IVIt does seem a pity that a person can't put an Idol on a pedestal andkeep it here without having it come down and bother around the house.The idea of being introduced to Mr. Douglass Byrd and having to speakdirectly to him with my own voice has kept me miserable all this monthin which I have been so perfectly happy being Roxanne's friend andconfidante, but it has happened and I'm glad it's over, though it wasunder trying circumstances.These are they. My fears have come to pass and in this eventful monthLovelace Peyton has grown from a slender, frail little boy into almostas much of a roly-poly as Mamie Sue, and looks more like her than hedoes like Roxanne. I try not to feed him more than four times a dayextra, but he is stern with me about it. Sometimes he will trade thecake I give him about four o'clock for a new shaped bottle, but lotsof times he gets the bottle and the cake both away from me. I justcan't be strong-minded with Lovelace Peyton, like I ought to be tomake up for the way Roxanne forgets to see him from the rosy cloud."If you'll give me a bottle, I'll give you one mouth-kiss, Phyllis;but for cake and bottles too, I can maybe make it two," is the way hebargains with me. Fifteen years is a long time to starve for a littlebrother to love, so Lovelace Peyton almost always gets both the cakeand bottles.But his fat has begun to burst out of all the clothes he has andsomebody has got to get him new ones. Roxanne and I were managing itwhen Mr. Douglass interrupted us this morning; and I'm glad a man isso much stupider than a woman or maybe his feelings would have gothurt and I'd have had to argue him into my plan like I did Roxanne. Ifeel sure I would have failed with him. He is the first Idol I everhad and I am new at managing either friends or idols. However, I havegot so I can get the best of Roxanne when it is urgently necessary."It's the funniest thing to me, Phyllis," Roxanne said the otherafternoon, as I went over to see her about my rhetoric lesson, "butrich as you are, I don't at all mind your seeing my scrimps like I dothe other girls, even Mamie Sue. You are like finding a grandmother'sthimble that fits you exactly and is pure gold."Oh, I wish I could learn to be gracious and say lovely things likeRoxanne, but I'm just a corked bottle and I can't get the stopper out."What are you doing?" I asked her instead of giving her a squeeze andsaying, "You are the dearest thing on earth to me, Roxanne," which waswhat I really felt."I'm sitting here before this old dress I found in the trunk in theattic and trying to think how I could make Lovey wear the floweredaprons I can make out of it. I almost know he won't, for he has begunto say what 'looks boy' and what 'looks girl.' I did hope I could keephim ignorant of the difference this summer at least. Would you ask himbefore you make the aprons or trust to his not noticing?"The old dress was the full skirt of fifty years ago, with huge redroses on a white-and-green dotted background, and, as aprons, wouldhave made the snake doctor look like a very young circus. I couldn'tstand the thought and cranked my mind as hard as I could for a halfminute. The idea came, and it is a good thing to be perfectly straightin the treatment of your friends at all times, so that when a crisiscomes they will depend on you."Roxanne," I said, looking determinedly and sternly into her face withFather's own expression, "have I ever offered you a single thing toeat except when you were company like the other girls, or anythingelse that would hurt the Byrd pride?""No, you haven't, Phyllis, and that's why I don't mind telling orletting you see things. You understand that it is for the cause, and Idon't have to be afraid that you will hurt--hurt my feelings."I never thought it would be possible for a girl to look at me likeRoxanne Byrd looked at me across the pile of ragged little aprons andold dresses. I thank God for it!"Well," I said, "for that dress I want to trade you this blue ginghamI have got on to make the aprons out of. It will make three if thetucks are ripped out of the skirt. I want the old flowered skirt tomake some cushions for the window seat in the room I sleep in, for itwill be just the thing to go with the old mahogany of yourgrandmother's. It is real old-fashioned chintz and is worth just aboutten times as much as this dress I have got on, which you know I boughtat Mr. Hadley's, with the other dozen ones that Miss Green is makingfor me, at twenty-five cents a yard. Will you?"Roxanne doesn't know about that awful spending burden I have had laidon me and she is just as interested in helping me go and buy myselfByrdsville clothes as a friend can be in another's pleasure--notknowing it to be painful responsibility.I locked the box that came from New York with all my spring and summerthings in it, in a closet the day it came, and while these things are,of course crude, I like to be in clothes like the other girls. I seemto fit in better. I spent seventy-five dollars at that store by hardeffort, and I think won Mr. Hadley's good will for life for bothFather and me. Also Miss Green's check was gratifyingly large both toher and me."Will you trade, Roxanne?" I asked again, keeping the eagerness out ofmy voice with my father's stern will."Oh, I don't think I ought." Roxanne hesitated and then said: "Are yousure you don't--that is, are you sure?""I am," I answered briskly, and in a business like tone. "You can'tsay that lovely old stuff won't make the very cushions for that veryroom, Roxanne.""They truly will be lovely, Phyllis, and that gingham will solve theproblem for Lovey's whole summer. To-morrow we will--""Not to-morrow; right now, and I'll help you rip and cut out from theskirt," I said, and began to undo my belt. I knew better than to letthat family pride get to simmering in Roxanne in the wee small hoursof the night. "A trade is a trade, as soon as it is made. Give me mydress.""Oh, Phyllis, there never was anybody like you," laughed Roxanne in avoice that is like music to a person who understands what friendshipreally is and hasn't had very much.We both laughed as I slipped the quaint old dress over my head andbuttoned the low-necked waist, with its short puffy-sleeves, straightdown the front. It had such a style of its own and fitted me so that Ibegan to prance in front of the long mirror in the living room, whichis gilt, a hundred years old, and belonged to the stiff grandmotherover the mantel who had probably pranced in the same gown in the sameway fifty years ago, if her heart was as young and happy as mine.And those were the trying circumstances under which I met the Idol. Hestood there in the doorway and laughed until his big shoulders shook,and his wonderful eyes danced like sparks. I blushed so painfully thatit felt like measles; but when he saw my embarrassment break out on melike that, a wonderful sad kindness came into his eyes and he stoppedlaughing."It's Miss Phyllis Forsythe, isn't it, that I have come home to findmasquerading as my own grandmother?" he said, in a warm voice so likeRoxanne's that the scarlatina on my face began to subside and my kneesstopped trembling. "You don't know how indebted to you I am for comingover to make Roxy take a playtime."Playtime, with all that pattern and darned aprons and my gingham dressin a pile on the ancestral sofa in the corner with the scissors andneedle and thread gaping at Roxanne and me from the table! Women oughtto be very thankful at times for men's stupidity.It was all very well for the red on my face to pale and my breath tocome easier again; but no fifteen-year-old girl has an answer readyfor a remark of a man who is as great and wonderful and famous as Mr.Douglass Byrd is going to be soon. I was just getting so loose-jointedfrom mortification that my mind had fainted away at the very time Ineeded it, when Tony and Pink Chadwell came and broke into thesituation with the Raccoon whistle for the palefaces. They also brokethrough the side window with their "Tip-hist-toe" signal that alwaysgives the girls cold creeps even in daytime. Mamie Sue calls itgoose-flesh and Tony reproves Belle for telling her that was what shehad all the time. I don't know what we would do with Belle if itwasn't for Tony's powerful disposition. And one thing I am sure of,never were there in this world such grand boys as Anthony WayneLuttrell and Matthew Foster Chadwell--that's Pink's whole name--forthey didn't any more notice that old flowered dress than if it hadbeen the blue gingham, or either Roxanne or me, but they gave thescout-master salute to Mr. Douglass and began their business rightaway.[Illustration: He stood there in the doorway and laughed until his bigshoulders shook]"Raccoon Chief," said Tony, "the patrol awaits you in the Crotch, atyour call.""On my way," answered Mr. Douglass with just as much seriousness asTony had in his voice. Tony had told me how Mr. Douglass had organizedthe Raccoon Patrol and taught it all it knows and was just the guidingstar of all their young lives, only Tony didn't put it that way; hecalled him their "jolly old peace-maker." That means that all theRaccoons look up to him and adore him and try to be exactly like him.In the Bible if David had been eight years older than Jonathan, therewould have been the same situation in Jerusalem as in Byrdsville,Tennessee."I wonder what is the matter with the Scouts," said Roxanne, as weboth began to rip on the dress so I could help her cut the aprons."Douglass didn't say what he came home for in the middle of theafternoon and Tony was so serious that I hardly knew him. Pink wasspeechless from excitement. They all acted that way when they foundout about the queer man who hung around selling patent medicine,trying to find out where Miss Prissy kept the Talbot emerald necklacethat came from England before the Revolution."Because Miss Prissy lives alone it is the duty of all of the Raccoonsto patrol her ever so many times in the day, and Judge Luttrell letsTony go out the last thing before he goes to bed and give Miss Prissythat signal we hear every night about half past nine. Miss Prissy saysit makes her comfortable the whole night, and the Colonel gave theRaccoons their wireless outfit for being such "Knights of the RoundMiss Prissy" instead of the "Table," Pink said; though the Colonelnever mentioned Miss Prissy in the speech of presentation at all, butcalled it Table.I'm not romantic myself, but I could never treat a man with the lackof heart with which Miss Prissy treats Colonel Stockell. She makesherself as beautiful as possible and sits on the front porch with him,and I would call that an honorable cause for marriage, but Roxannesays that in Byrdsville no tie binds a lady to marry a gentleman untilafter it is done. Such treatment does not look to me like what fathercalls a "square deal"; but Miss Priscilla may have some way ofsquaring it to her conscience, as she is very religious andcharitable."I'm glad Douglass doesn't have to know that we traded dresses,Phyllis," said Roxanne, as we both snipped away on the long seams,after he had gone with Tony and Pink. Why it is so much more fun torip things than to sew them, is a question I put to you, leatherLouise."Just last night," Roxanne continued, "he made me sit out here on theporch with him and he told me it might be all summer that he will haveto use his wages to get the things for the experiments. Mr. Rogers hasacted queerly and he is afraid to try anything out at these furnaces,so we have to save up enough for him to go up to Kentucky to somelittle furnaces there and make the experiment. It will cost a lot forthe trip and the things, but I think we can do it. This simple lifeagrees with us all. Just look how fat Lovey is getting with hardlyanything but buttermilk and corn-bread. It makes me happy to look athim."The giggle that I had to smother down in my heart was one of the goodthings that come in a person's life and leave a mark on their naturesfor always. I think it is a fine plan to save little happinesses andput them up on a spirit shelf to take down to feed your remembers onin days when pleasures are scarce. I can't believe that this life ofbeing with and of other people is going to last for me; so if I haveto go back into loneliness I will have had it to remember.Any mention of that dynamite secret and Rogers in the sameconversation always makes me uneasy and that is why I had lonelinessthoughts."What has Mr. Rogers done to make your brother uneasy about thesecret?" I asked Roxanne in a voice that I could see, myself, wasworried."Nothing at all," laughed Roxanne; "but we are all just assuperstitious as old Uncle Pompey, and because Douglass has a'feeling' about Mr. Rogers, we all have to have it, too. We make it apoint to 'feel' with each other as both Douglass and I did when wejust knew with Uncle Pompey that the white rooster would die from thelye soap that Lovey made him take in a pill. It took Douglass and metwo whole days to get Lovey to go on his honor about doctoring thechicken, but he finally agreed, if we would promise to let him dothings to all of us whenever he wanted to. Douglass lets him treat hishead with cold water, which is just hard rubbing that he likes betterthan anything, every night before supper. I'm wearing a yarn stringaround my ankle now for rheumatism that I haven't got. In fact we areall 'on honor' with Lovey, to save the 'live stock,' as Uncle Pompeycalls himself and the chickens."Never having had any experience with little boys, I can't saypositively that Lovelace Peyton is a wonder, but I firmly believe itand his honor is entirely grown up while he is not quite five. I'veseen it work. If he says he will or he won't, he acts accordingly, nomatter what happens to him or anybody else. But he is careful how hepromises and he leaves himself plenty of room to carry on what hecalls his practice, to the uneasiness of himself and all theneighbors. It cost Miss Prissy ten bottles, a pint of red paint, and apackage of sulphur to buy the life of her gray cat for this year, butnow she has no uneasiness about Tab at all.I suppose if Roxanne and I sat down and talked one month straightthrough without eating and sleeping we might make up all the time wehave lost out of each other's company, at least just skim the creamoff each other's lives, but we'll never get to it. Too many peoplewant Roxanne besides me, and I'm grateful to be allowed to be in thethings she is in. I try to keep the other girls from feeling that I amin the way, and I don't believe they would feel that way at all ifBelle didn't still keep prodding them up with her distrust of mymoney. I wish Belle just had a little wealth and would find out thatit isn't anything at all and can be forgotten without the leasttrouble.Mamie Sue wants to like me and the two silent Willises do, also, butBelle dusts my gold into their eyes so they can just blink at me sofar. But the blinks get friendlier every day and I hope some shockwill make them open their eyes to me like kittens do on the ninthday--and their hearts, too.The tallest Willis gave me the first peony that bloomed on their bushto take to my mother, and I caught a sight of her awkward heart thatdid me good. I defied the nurse and told the white, white little thingon the pillow, that is all the mother I ever had, that one of myfriends sent it to her, and I got a flash of a smile, such as I hadnever had before. The nurse said just that little bit of excitementmade her worse, and I've promised never to do anything but take mydaily look at her again--but--she _is_ my mother, even if--Well, anyway, Louise of leather, just as Roxanne and I had got theskirt ripped up and the pattern straightened out, we saw all the girlscoming, and from the way they were talking we saw somethinginteresting was surely happening, had happened, or was going tohappen."Hide the gingham, Roxanne, while I slip over the wall and change mydress," I said quickly. "Our business arrangements are nobody else'sbusiness.""Will you come right back?" asked Roxanne in a way that made me knowshe would worry if I didn't.I would rather have stayed at home until the girls had had their visitand gone home, but I have thought out just how I ought to act aboutRoxanne and her friends and me. It is only fair to pay no attention tohow they feel, but to do what makes Roxanne happy in case of themix-up of us all. My pride and Roxanne's are different. Hers has beenhanded down for generations and she can act on it without argumentwith herself, but mine is my own kind and only I understand it. It isnew and I have to plan it out by thinking. The girls all think thatbecause I have finer clothes and travel and am rich, that I think I ambetter than they are and am proud of it. Richness is not my fault, anymore than a hunched back would be, and it is my duty to forget itwhether they do or not. I act accordingly.Another thing: I believe something is making my father see the errorof his ways and I hope that some day I will see him settled into beinga good and great man just like Judge Luttrell and the Colonel are andRoxanne's father was. He has acted in a peculiar way just lately. Lastnight he drew me up close to him and stood by the window a long timewithout speaking."Phil," he finally said, not in the voice he generally uses as if hewere speaking to his only son--but with a daughter tone in it--"youhave made good in Byrdsville, and I want to tell you that I'm proud ofyou. I doubted whether you could do it. A bunch of such youngsters asyou have made friends with would be a test for any man, much less ayoung woman. I'm their friend because they are yours, and pretty soonI am going to prove it--like the sentimental fools that all fathers ofalmost-grown daughters get to be. Go to bed, kiddie, and say an extraone for Father."Now all this is directly connected with the state I found the girls inover at the Byrd cottage, when I finally dressed and got back again,after stopping to bargain with Lovelace Peyton to go without thefour-o'clock cookies for half a tube of perfectly harmless tooth-pastethat he wanted for some kind of plaster to put on Uncle Pompey's heel,which is always painful enough to occupy most of the snake-doctor'stime."No, I don't see why we should always tell Phyllis every interestingthing that happens to us or is going to happen," Belle was saying insuch a decided tone of voice that it carried through the front door,across the porch, and halfway down the front walk.Disagreeability has a kind of force that knocks one down beforepleasantness hardly gets to him. I knew Roxanne said something inanswer to that; in my heart I knew, but I couldn't hear what it waswith my ears."Well," came Mamie Sue's voice, muffled through a piece of fudge shealways carries in her pocket, in case she goes a square away from homeand is overtaken by her appetite. She always has enough for everybodyelse, too, I must not forget to add. "Well, if it is Miss Prissy'srobber come back, that makes the boys act so, Phyllis might just aswell be scared as the rest of us; and if it is something pleasant,why, let her have a share of that, too." Some day I'm going-to breakloose from myself and hug Mamie Sue's funny fatness until she squeals."I don't believe that if it was just a frolic the boys would have gotDouglass to come away from his work to the Crotch; but maybe he wasgoing up-town anyway, and they knew that," said Roxanne as I came inthe door and was given welcomes of different degrees. The tall Willisis getting so that she moves over for me to sit down by her, even ifshe is just sitting on one small chair. I wish she could know how thatpleases me."Did the boys look to you as if the thing that is making them all actso important was nice or disagreeable, Phyllis?" asked Roxanne as shegot out the inevitable darning bag.The short Willis moved nearer and began to help sort and get ready forpatching. I always keep a thimble in Roxanne's darning bag now, butsometimes the short girl beats me to it. The others never notice thatRoxanne's hands are never empty of patching jobs. Still Mamie Sue doesattentively feed her fudge in hunks while she darns."I don't know boys well enough to diagram their expressions," Ianswered. "They always look excited and queer to me, and I can't telltheir jokes from their other affairs. What have they been doing?""Being as hateful and secret as they know how to be," answered Bellecrossly. "Boys are nothing but rough, rude miseries; and the next timeTony Luttrell tells me to 'bubble along' as he did Mamie Sue and me,when Mamie Sue only wanted to stop him to give him a piece of fudge, Iam going to tell him what I think of him.""Hope I'll be there," said the tall Willis behind my shoulder, and Inever enjoyed a silent remark more. Belle is as afraid of Tony's laughas she is of a cow in the lane."Now I know that something awful has happened or is coming if Tonyspoke that way," said Roxanne, with such anxiety coming into her facethat the timid Willis dropped her stocking and Mamie Sue gulped downsuch a large piece of candy that she almost had to choke. "Oh, girls,do you suppose that dreadful man has got out of jail in the city andis coming back to maybe--maybe--?"But the words were stopped in Roxanne's mouth with a great, pleasantlaugh as the Idol stood in the door. You would know that "Idol" is thename for him by the way all the girls look awed and afraid of him, butinterested too. Tony and Pink and Sam were in the background like theangels in the picture of Sir Galahad."This is an official committee to invite you to be the guests of Mr.William Forsythe on a hay-mooning on Friday next, to start from hishome at the hour of seven-thirty, in honor of the birthday of hisdaughter, Miss Phyllis, who is quite as surprised as the rest of you.The rest of this speech will be continued on that evening." And he wasgone before anybody got any breath again.That's what my father meant by showing my friends that he appreciatedthem.But Belle Kirby's expression would make anybody with a sense of humorlaugh. Can live coals be showered on a person if nobody ever intendedit?CHAPTER VThe desire to be popular may be one of the unworthy ambitions of aperson's heart, yet there is nothing in the world so delightful ashaving it happen to you. And if having almost everybody like you, andshow it by being nice and friendly to you on all occasions, makes youhappy your own self, how much more happy you are when somebody youlove gets a slice of it all along with you!My father is getting to be one of the beloved men of this town, likeJudge Luttrell and the Colonel. It has been going on gradually forsome time, but I was afraid to notice it for fear I was mistaken. Suchis the result of the sincere prayers of a daughter, and I certainlywas sincere in wanting this reform. And better than even his sittingand smoking and joking in the Judge's office and walking down thestreet in a friendly manner with Mr. Chadwell is the notice that Mr.Douglass Byrd has been taking of him lately. The Idol has been to seehim twice, in the evening, and both times I have heard my father'sjolly laugh boom out in a way the nurse says will have to stop, for itmade Mother ask to see him and be ill because she couldn't. And justday before yesterday Father came up the street with the greatinventor, and they both came in and sat with Roxanne and me on thecottage porch to smoke their cigars. Roxanne was just sweet and goodand easy with Father like she always is. I don't believe that girl wasever conscious of her feet and hands and blushes In all her life. Iforget mine when I am with her.Well anyway, Father was delighted with her and showed it plainly. Andif he liked her, he was positively funny when he met Lovelace Peyton.The snake-doctor came around the house, as usual galloping on thestick horse, and in one hand he had one of his best bottles full ofsomething awful to look at and that smelled worse, even through thecork."Mister," he said, looking Father gravely and courteously in the face,"you got cholera bad and might die to-night if you don't take medicinequick. It's in this bottle; shake it well." And while the Idol made agrab for him he put that bottle right in Father's hand and backed offout of reach.Roxanne was distressed at Father's having taken that awful smell intohis hands, and Mr. Douglass tried to make him give it back to LovelacePeyton; but Father wrapped it in two handkerchiefs and put it, smelland all, into his pocket."Thank you, Doctor Byrd," he said, just as gravely as he talks to thegreat surgeons and doctors that come to see Mother. "Shall I report mycondition to you to-morrow?""That medicine will work fine," answered Lovelace Peyton; "but if itkills you, can I cut you open to see how you work inside? WhenDouglass dies, I'm going to cut him into little pieces; he's donepromised.""Oh, Lovey," was all Roxanne could say, while Father and the Idol bothroared.I never saw my father's face so lovely as it was when he looked downon that little raggedy boy as we left him swinging on the front gate.His heart is softening away from wealth to his fellow-man, I know.And, as if it had not made me happy enough to have Father sitting andsmoking with such a great character as Mr. Douglass Byrd, what shouldhappen but for us to meet Tony at our front gate, coming to see Fatherespecially? They made me go in and wait on the front steps while theytalked, because they didn't want me to hear; and they both laughed sothat Father tried to get out his handkerchief and succeeded indropping the awful bottle Lovelace had given him, while Tony leanedagainst the fence and shook with chuckles at Lovey's giving him suchan awful smell. Oh, if they were to elect my father an honorary memberof the Raccoon Patrol like the Colonel and the Idol, I could not standthe happiness. Tony's friendship for him gives me one of the deepestjoys that ever came to me. Tony's high sense of honor cannot help butimpress Father.This little town of Byrdsville, that nestles down in a hollow of theOld Harpeth Hills on the old pioneer road they called the Road toProvidence, when the first settlers traveled it from Virginia toTennessee, is the most wonderful place in the world, I think, and Iwish Father could have been born and reared here, for then he wouldn'thave strayed into a career of making money. Nobody in Byrdsville everdid, and Mr. Douglass Byrd will be the first one. And besides havingthe soul of honor and loving-kindness in it, Byrdsville looks like itmight be one of the outposts of heaven, where tired souls can come torest before going up the shining ladder.[Illustration: I never saw my father's face so lovely]All the houses are old-fashioned, with wide doors for welcoming andwith vines running over the chimneys and up to the eaves, while bloomsand buds tumble over the walls and burst from the gardens into thestreet. Yes, I think Byrdsville might be called the smile-place on theold earth's round face.But to return to Father and Tony at the front gate; only I didn't.Father went on down the street and Tony came in to sit on the stepsand talk to me. I wouldn't be so frivolous and growny as to have a boycome sit on my front steps talking to me like a "suitor," as Bellethinks it is smart to have; but Tony is different. He's my friend, andI would almost as soon talk to him as Roxanne."Well, I must say, girliky, that it was mighty considerate of you tobe born about the full moon time of the first of May," said Tony, withone of those funny flares of his eyes. "Suppose you had opened yourpeepers along in December; we would have had to have an apple-roastingto celebrate for you, and I, for one, prefer the hay-lark. Your parentis one fine old boy, and me for him.""Oh, Tony, I am so glad you like Father, and it was fine of him tohave the hay ride for me. Do you suppose they will all go?" When Isaid "all," I really meant Belle.I don't know why, but somehow I hoped this hay ride would shake upBelle's heart into being soft toward me. There are just eleven of usin the junior class in the Byrd Academy: Tony and Pink and Sam and thetwo Logan boys, while Roxanne and Mamie Sue and Belle and the twoWillises, with me, make up the girls. Eleven is a sacred number, and Idon't like for Belle and me to break the link by not being friends.Tony is such a wise boy that he sometimes knows what a girl isthinking about when she doesn't tell him. Most of the time he justgrins and leads us all on and we do tell him everything; especiallyMamie Sue, if we don't warn her beforehand and make her wear ahorsehair ring not to forget when he asks her questions. It makesBelle mad for him to do Mamie Sue that way, and she calls it "prying";but I think it is just kindness. How can you sympathize with yourfriends' affairs if you don't make them tell you all? And sympathyapplied to life is like the gasoline in a motorcar, I think."Well, I should say they were all going," answered Tonyenthusiastically. "Even Belle, the beauty, can hardly wait for theget-away. She is putting buttermilk on her freckles so that the moonwon't see 'em. Miss Prissy is over at Roxanne's now, trying to basteRoxy together for the frolic.""I think Roxanne always looks lovelier than anybody," I said quickly;for I didn't think I could bear to have even Tony, when I know what agreat love he has for her, criticize Roxanne's shabbiness. They don'tany of them know what a heroine she is, and about the great cause."Course she looks good, 'cause she is the pretty child; but I alwaysfeel like carrying a needle and thread and a card of pins when Roxy isalong. And let me tell you the bug-doctor is about to burst out intothe cold world from his aprons. I know old Doug makes enough to ragthe family, but Roxy is just behindhand getting rabbit skins to wrapthe buntings in. Lots of girls are poky about doing around."If Tony Luttrell had known how cruel that sounded, it would have brokenhis heart. But I couldn't tell him what a heroine Roxanne is and I justhad to shudder in my soul to see her so misunderstood--Roxanne, whoseevery day is just one big patch on life."It is lovely of Miss Priscilla to go with us," I said, to change thesubject."It would be a dry hay ride if the Miss Bubble wasn't sitting in thevery midst of the crowd and the wagon, with the Colonel prancing alongbeside on old White. Your father is going to ride out with the Coloneland--but that's the surprise. Being with your gingham gang so much, Iam about to get the talks." And Tony put his hand over his mouth andmoved away from me as if I had the scarlet fever.I laughed at Tony and from sheer happiness at thinking that my fatherwas going with us in the fine company of the Colonel and MissPriscilla. I wonder what we would do, if we had to have somebody go toplaces with us who thought they had to chaperon us? Miss Prissy isjust one of us and would go if we had to ask somebody like Belle'smother, for instance, who is always talking about chaperons, to goalso.As I have remarked before, Byrdsville is a very different place frommost of the world, and I thank God that he led me to it and "made meto lie down in its green pastures, beside its still waters." I foundthat in the Bible the other night, and it fitted me and Byrdsville.Good-night, Louise!Of course when I grow up I shall have many things happen to me, likegraduating from Byrdsville Academy, marrying, and being president ofclubs, and going to balls and theaters in the city, if I have to; butthere will never be a night like this one of my sixteenth birthday,April twenty-second.Miss Priscilla Talbot was the first slice out of the happinessbirthday cake when we met down at her house to get into the wagon. Ican never have things here at my home like that, because of theprecious sick thing upstairs that cannot be disturbed, but who is thecore of my heart, anyway, even if she doesn't know it.But of all astonishing things, this is what Miss Priscilla did as wewere all lined up for Father and the Colonel to help us into the wagonon the great mound of hay, to the front of which four horses werehitched."And now to start off the birthday we must each give Phyllis a kiss,as we would do if we were blowing out the candies on the cake that ispacked in the basket; and each one whisper a wish to her, as they giveher a kiss. I will be first and the Colonel next," she said and shebent down and kissed me and whispered: "A happy sixteenth year."I never had been kissed--even Father never did it to me, because Ihave been more like a son than a daughter, and he hasn't thought ofit. To get a whole wagonload of them at one time, and unaccustomed tothem, was enough to paralyze any girl, and I stood dumb and tookit--them, I mean. The blow-out-the-candle-with-a-kiss-wish is one ofthe first family birthday customs in Byrdsville, and I felt that itwas right to subscribe to it. I didn't mind when I saw the boys weregoing to refuse firmly to do it and just shake hands instead."Bully for you, Bubble, and a pound or two to cover your elbows," Tonyexploded while he nearly pumped my arm out of the socket. Everybodylaughed, because I _am_ getting thin with so much growing.The Colonel's kiss was a ceremonial, like you have in church or atgraduation day, and his wish took five minutes to say, but the tallWillis choked up my throat with the lump by whispering a hope for mymother, which can never be, I know.Next the Idol kissed my hand with grace like is in a story-book andwhich made my whole arm act like a poker. Father hugged me with allthe energy he hadn't been using on me all my life. It hurt me happily.Roxanne came last and she saved hers until the Colonel had packed usdown together in a nest of hay at Miss Priscilla's feet like twokittens in a basket, with Lovelace Peyton squirming around as a third."You never encouraged me to kiss you before, Phyllis," she whispered,with her arm around my neck; "but I'm going to whenever I want toafter this, and here's a wish that we will never get separated fartherthan kissing distance, now that we have found each other."Only Lovelace Peyton kept me from crying out loud like a baby fromhappiness. He burrowed between Roxanne and me in a search for somepeppermint he smelled in the hay, and stuck one knee right into mymouth to stop the sob, which was a laugh when I removed the knee forit to get out. My first hug around Roxanne's waist was mighty awkward,but I know she understood.After that the picnic unfolded its minutes in such a cloud ofmoonlight and rosy happiness, accompanied by song, that I don't knowvery well what really did happen. For once I felt that I was lookingon life from the same exalted point of view that Roxanne always has,and I hope it will become a habit with me. Only I know it won't.Tony's surprise, that he had got Father to help him about, was ahot-air balloon that the Scout book tells them how to make, and theysent one up from the place we stopped at, out on Providence Road, with"Phyllis," cut out in great big letters and lighted with a candleinside, which wobbled and set the whole thing on fire before it gotmuch higher than the trees. Still, it did go up and it had my name onit! When I got off the train in Byrdsville two months ago I couldn'thave believed in that balloon, if it had been revealed to me in avision. Do I deserve it all?One of the reasons of my rosy view was that the Idol rode upon thefront seat of the wagon, with the farmer who drove, and smoked one ofFather's cigars and led all the songs in the most marvelouslybeautiful voice I ever heard. He was on the Glee Club at Princeton,and of course to have him come to the party at all was a compliment.He helped Miss Priscilla and me unpack the suppers out on TiltingRock, and acted only a little more grown-up than Tony and Pink, Idon't know whether I quite liked to have him unbend so far as to throwa biscuit back at Tony. He is too great a man for that, and I wasrelieved when he took the Colonel's horse and started back to town,because he said he had something to attend to. It is more comfortablefor me to have him on the pedestal I keep for him, than down in theordinary walks of life with me and the rest of my friends--fine andunusual people as they all are. Also I am afraid I might betray insome way my great affection and veneration for him if we got toofamiliar over a pickle jar, and he might not like it. How do I know hewants to be enthroned and "idolized" in my heart?Yes, I was glad to see him go home early before I got so light-headedwith happiness as to squabble over pie with Pink and put alightning-bug into Tony's lemonade glass. Father went with him, andhow good it did seem to see them ride away together through themoonlight down Providence Road to Byrdsville, which lay in the dimdistance with its lights making it my huge birthday cake, decoratedwith all the lilacs and roses and redbud abloom in the Harpeth Valley.Some people are so accustomed to happiness that they don't even noticeit. I'm glad I haven't had that much.One of the nice things about Miss Priscilla and the Colonel is thatthey go off and sit by themselves and entirely forget to ever say gohome, until we have all had our fill of fun; then they begin to hurryat a terrible rate that gets up a pleasant excitement. They seem toknow just the minute when we might begin to get tired, and they neverlet it come. Some people are geniuses about good times, and theColonel and Miss Priscilla are two of that kind.The ride home was almost the best of all. The boys sang and gaveRaccoon calls and practised different kinds of wood signals and atethe things we had saved from supper, with Mamie Sue to keep themcompany, also Lovelace Peyton, who slept part of the time with hishead on Tony's knees, but waked up if any stray refreshmentsthreatened to get past him. We all hushed at the edge of town, for theColonel said it was after midnight, and he unpacked each one at his orher own front door so softly that not even a dog barked. He put me outat the cottage because he didn't want to stop the wagon in front ofour house on account of disturbing Mother, and I went in to unfastenRoxanne's dress and to get mine done likewise, then I could slip homethrough the garden, which is always so lovely with the moonlightmaking ghost flowers of Roxanne's ancestral blossoms.I wish I didn't have to write you, leather Louise, what happened next,at the same time as the birthday, but I can't sleep unless I do. WouldGod be so cruel to me as to let me get just this one little taste ofbeing happy and then take it away from me? I won't believe it!This is what happened, set down in black and white, and I can draw noconclusions from it. I refuse! As Roxanne and I stood in the livinghall, under the stern old Byrd grandmother, giggling and having agood, girl time like I have just been learning to do, suddenly thedoor opened and the Idol stood in the light we had lighted, with hisface so pale I thought he was going to faint."Roxy," he said, not seeming to notice me, "you haven't been in myshed working with my bottles, have you? Or could Lovey have got in? Ihave the key and the window is barred, as I always keep it.""Oh, no, Douglass, I haven't been near the shed this week. My key ishere on the hook in the left-hand bookcase," and she reached behindher, took it, and showed it to him. "I know Lovey hasn't been thereeither, because we can trust him on honor. Oh, what is the matter?" AsRoxanne asked the question she was trembling all over, but not in thedeadly cold way I was, I felt sure. She couldn't have stood it andlived."Some one has been in the shed, taken samples of all my material,including the steel shavings that came from the last melting, and mynotebook is gone. The process is stolen, Roxy, and all the sacrificesgone for nothing. I don't care for myself--but--you." His head was upin the same old portrait pose, but his arms trembled as he held themout to Roxanne.I stood still and cold and never said one word, but a pain hit into myheart that I didn't know I was strong enough to stand and still live."When did you find it out?" I asked; and I was surprised at the coolnote that sounded in my voice and made it like Father's when he talksbusiness."Just now," he answered me over Roxanne's head that was buried on hisshoulder. "I stopped down-town to help Judge Luttrell with a briefthat he was writing and came home only a few minutes ago. The thiefwas in the shed between the time I went on the hay ride and now. I wasin the shed just before I started."I don't know how I said good-night to them; but I did the best Icould, and came home through the moonlight with a great heaviness ofheart and feet. I dreaded to see Father, and yet longed for him in away I never did before in all my life. If anything awful is true, thenhe is more mine than ever. But it can't be! And when I looked for himI found him--in a way I never had before. He was standing at mymother's door and the great big man was crying just like a girl, withhis shoulders shaking and big sobs coming."Bess, Bess," he sobbed Mother's name under his breath, "she's goingto be a grown woman and I don't know what to do without you. Ten longyears. Oh, Bess!"Yes, I suppose I'm nearer a grown woman than most girls of my age, andI'm tall enough to take a big man in my arms, which are so long andthin as to be a joke, and hold him close enough to make the sobs stopcoming."Now, Phil, I leave it to you if you are not enough to upset any man,with your moonlight picnics and folderols," Father said, in just a fewseconds from the time I hugged him up. He was both laughing andsniffling into his handkerchief at the same time, and I had a lovelyLovelace Peyton feeling about him, because he looked so young andashamed of himself for being caught crying."I'm just as much your son as I ever was, Father," I said with a gulpand a lump in my own throat. "I'm never going to be a daughter, if youdon't want one.""I do, Phyllis, I do; but I want the son-girl sometimes, too. You goto bed." And with a sound hug that nearly broke my ribs, as neither henor I were used to them, he went into his room and shut his doordecidedly.CHAPTER VIA serious disposition can make more trouble for itself by its ownseriousness than all the misfortunes that come can make for it. If Ihad just a little touch of Roxanne Byrd's foamy spirits, I would be amuch more comfortable companion for myself. All night I lay awake,anchored in the middle of the huge old Byrd bedstead, and sorrowedover the misfortune that had come to Roxanne and the Idol. Over andover I went in my mind to see where I could clear Mr. Rogers of mysuspicions until my thoughts were so pale in color that I could hardlymake them out, and at last I fell asleep in despair.In the morning I dressed so slowly that it was nine o'clock before Iwas buttoned into my dress and felt that I could go over and helpRoxanne bear the calamity. It was Saturday, so I knew she would needhelp in doing all the things she leaves undone until this blessed dayof relief from school cares and responsibilities comes.It is strange how ignorant one can be of the disposition of the veryperson she loves best on earth. Did I find Roxanne Byrd dissolved inan indigo sea on the day after she had lost a huge fortune? Not atall! She was floating still higher on a still more rosy cloud andeating a large slice of the most delicious nut cake, while LovelacePeyton did likewise."Oh, Phyllis, I was just going to call you to get a piece of UnclePompey's nut cake before it gets cold. It is famous in Byrdsville, andI've been dying to have one made to give you ever since you came; onlyI couldn't get the materials. It takes every good thing in a grocery,from ginger to preserved cherries, to go in it, and it is best hot.Uncle Pompey said for me to wait until the second pan came out of thestove to call you, because it is always best. He has out the Sheffieldtray with the old point cover on it and one of great-grandmotherByrd's willow plates to put it on for you. I'll let him bring it toyou and see you taste it. Poor Uncle Pompey is a famous cook, andeconomy has been agony to him. I'm going to let him make every goodthing he wants to this week. He has been held down so long." Roxannebubbled along like a lovely mountain torrent of cheerfulness, while Istood rooted to the spot in an astonishment that I could not conceal."Oh, Roxanne," I said weakly, as I sank into a chair."Yes, Phyllis, I suppose it is funny to see me enjoying the cake likethis after what happened last night; but the Byrds always make otherplans as soon as anything happens to the first one. Douglass and Idecided to rest from the steel invention by having things we want fortwo or three months, and then he knows something greater to inventthan steel could ever be. He hasn't told me yet, but I'll tell youwhen he does. Oh, there's Uncle Pompey with the cake. It's lovely,isn't it, Phyllis?"If a person went to a funeral and met the dead friend at the doorhanding her a piece of cake, I suppose she would feel about like I didwhen that funny old black man handed me that lovely and elegant traywith a grin on his face so wide that it is a wonder it didn't meetitself at the back of his head. I wonder to this moment where I gotthe enthusiasm with which I accepted it."Eat all you want to, Phyllis, 'cause I've got a good plaster to puton the place when the ache comes," Lovelace Peyton advised from hisseat on the floor where he was alternately eating his piece of cakeand rolling black pills from the crumbs that he caught in a pasteboardbox.And as I sat and munched that piece of historic Byrd cookery my brainturned over in my head and settled itself in a new way. My wholenature underwent a revolution. I saw that a person can either acceptlife as a piece of fluffy cake when it is handed to her or look on itall as--soggy. I'm going to follow Roxanne's example after this andsee the fluffiness of the cake determinedly."And, Phyllis, I'll tell you what else I'm going to do," continuedRoxanne, rocking and nibbling and smiling so that I would like to haveeaten her up, from shabby shoes to the curl down the back of the neck."When I went down to the grocery before breakfast to get the things toconsole Uncle Pompey after we had told him about the robbery, I sawthe loveliest blue muslin in the window at Mr. Hadley's store, and I'in going to buy it to-day and make me a dress for commencement. I hadexpected to wear the family linen, but Douglass says let's spend allhis salary this month in having things we want; so the blue muslinwill be my part. Do you think blue will be prettier than pink, orwould you have--?"But just here we were interrupted by Tony's appearance at the door,and the expression on his face matched the one I had had of condolenceas I came over through the garden; but he has known Roxanne longerthan I have and boys' minds are supposed to be stronger thangirls'--privately I don't think they are--so he accepted the situationand the cake with more grace than I had.However he was cruelly insistent about questioning and talking aboutthe robbery. The Idol had told him about it as Tony walked out to thefurnace with him, which is a Saturday habit with Tony as the Jonathanto Mr. Douglass. Tony had known all along about the steel, but wassurprised to know that I had been able to keep it to myself. I supposeit is best never to notice an unconscious insult, and boys are oftenthat way with girls."Doug and I both think that this is not the first time the robber hasbeen in or around the shed," Tony said thoughtfully. "Do you rememberthat shadow we saw dodge through the yard the evening we came from theRaccoon outing, Phyllis?""Yes," I answered; and the uneasy feeling I had about Mr. Rogers thatnight so I couldn't sleep slightly tipped the rosy cloud I had decidedto climb upon and stay upon forever. "But it may have been UnclePompey, like I thought it was," I added hopefully."Well, Doug told me to come and nose around and see what I could findin the way of clues. Want to come out and have a look with me? You twoPalefaces might as well learn something about gumshoeing a villain nowas ever."Lots of boys, and grown-up people for that matter, like to keepinteresting things and doings to themselves; but Tony Luttrell is asgenerous in disposition as he is in mouth.We went out to the shed with him, and Lovelace Peyton went too, butrefused to come in the shed door because he said he was still on honorto the Idol, no matter what Roxanne said, not to come nearer than oneyard, which was marked with sticks all around the shed. It was funnyto see the snake-doctor lean across the dead-line and crane his sweetlittle neck to try to hear and see Tony inside the shed. And afterTony had squinted at and touched and nosed almost every inch of theshed, he came out with his hands in his pockets."Any clue?" asked Roxanne, as anxiously as Roxanne could ask aboutanything from the cloud."N--o," he said in a hesitating sort of way that seemed just asprofessional as the way the detectives talk in the wonderful storiesin the magazines that my governess always reproved me for reading."That was a slick artist who got away on greased heels, but there isa--smell in there that I've never felt before in the shed. And yet Ihave met it somewhere, I feel certain. It seems to my nose somewhatlike the bug-doctor at his worst.""No, Tony," said Lovelace Peyton, positively but perfectly calmly, "Iain't been in that shed and my bottles ain't got legs."We all laughed and came to the house--but I had got a whiff of thatodor and I knew where I had met it before. It was raw onion and tar,and it was the mixture that Lovelace Peyton had given Father in thebottle he wrapped in his handkerchief and put in his pocket. I feltweak all over for a second, but I immediately remembered my duty torespect my father even in my thoughts. I had decided that in thewatches of last night, after I had found his heart and hugged it upoutside of Mother's door.In the first place, I had no business to read those magazines that mygoverness told me not to, even if she did have so little sense thather brain must have been made of tatting work originally, which shewas always doing by the yard. And while the explanation of what anevil it is to get millions and millions of dollars together when thepoor have so little, and that no man who has a human heart in hisbreast would want to do it is perfectly true, still that man who wrotethe article might not have known about my father. I can see how a manmight go on for years and do a great wrong to his brother man andreally not realize what a monster it makes of him. I believe my fatheris just blind on that side of things like some people are in one eye.I pray God that he may wake up sometime, and die happy but poor! Ofcourse, I know he had nothing to do with taking the steel secret, andI am going to get on the cloud again and not worry over Roxanne'stroubles until she needs something; and then I will come down and getit for her while she stays in the air,--if I can.[Illustration: Tony ... nosed almost every inch of the shed]The really important things in a person's life underlie the dailyoccurrence like the sand that is at the bottom of the rose-bushes.School is the sand-bank of a girl's life, rather heavy, but supportingthe roses of debates and picnics and commencement and expressionimpersonations like the one Friday night is to be.Of course Byrd Academy graduated Judge Luttrell and the Colonel andRoxanne's Father as well as Miss Prissy, and all the other learnedladies in the Browning Society; but for all its historical antiquity,it is one of the most advanced places of learning in the South, andmostly on account of the progressiveness of the Junior Class, which isTony and Roxanne and the rest of us.The Senior Class this year is a great failure, because all are girlsbut the Petway boy, who is terribly feminine, and crochets his ownsilk ties, Tony says. I don't approve of the seniors at all, and bothRoxanne and I are worried over the way Helena Kirby, Belle's sister,will insist on talking to the Idol when we come out of church. We bothknow how important it is for a great man to have lady friends that aregreat enough to appreciate him. Of course, Helena can only admire hiswonderful eyes, which makes no difference to us at all, for she couldnever gauge his high soul and genius. Roxanne says she trusts to thepatches on his trousers to keep him from going to walk with her andfrom sitting on her front steps. Oh, if we just can keep him pure fromprosperity in the shape of new clothes until he makes this secondgreat invention, we will be so thankful, I encourage Roxanne to spendthe money on food and her own clothes, so he will not be able to buy anew suit. We feel so safe with him mortifyingly shabby."Oh, Douglass is never going to be in love or marry anybody," saidRoxanne when we were speculating on why Helena would flirt her eyes soat him. "I feel perfectly sure we'll have him always."I felt relieved that Roxanne felt that way, but I had to remind myselfoften of her rose-cloud disposition and watch carefully to see that notroubles that I can avert--like Helena Kirby--shall come to her or theIdol.But I started on the subject of the impersonations that the ExpressionClass of Juniors is to give the last day of April, before the wholeacademy is turned over to the affairs of the Seniors, like graduationessays being practised from morning to night until you speak each onein your own dreams. This is the first time they ever had such a thingin the academy, and the whole town is as excited and interested as itwell can be.Mr. Douglass Byrd thought it all up a month ago for us Juniors becauseof our Senior oppression and after his great loss he went on just thesame helping us practise and seemed to be as interested in us as if wehad been explosives in a bottle or a test-tube or a retort. His greatserenity of soul is a constant lesson to me. Good-night, Louise. Youare a comfort; you settle my thoughts, though just of leather.This is the night of the impersonations and they are over. It was oneof the greatest triumphs ever experienced at the Byrd Academy. It willprobably be mentioned in the future with the same praise as theColonel's valedictory that left not a dry eye in the house, becausethey all knew that all the boys in the Senior Class of sixty-one wouldgo to the war the next week. I choke up whenever I hear the Coloneltell of it, as I have many times in these last two months of my lifein Byrdsville. Miss Prissy always cries copiously when he gets to theplace where she gave him a flower when he had walked home withher--she only fourteen years old and in short dresses--and which hewore in battle in his pocket Bible. What would she do if she shouldlose the Colonel by sudden death before she has rewarded hisaffections by marrying him? She ought to think of that.Belle did beautifully, first on the program, dressed up in grownclothes and having a Byrdsville society conversation over an imaginarytelephone. It sounded just like Helena, and I thought it was not verynice of her to impersonate her own sister, but it was a comfort to seehow the Idol enjoyed it. If he liked Helena to any extent, he wouldhave displayed indignation. Instead the corners of his mouth twitchedfor minutes afterward. I believe at some time Helena must havetelephoned him.Mamie Sue did a delicious old lady telling about her grandson to thetwo Willises, who were company to tea, that made Hie audience shakewith jollity. There was a perfectly darling trace of Miss Priscilla inthe way she did it, that made the Colonel almost unable to keep hisseat, and Miss Priscilla laughed out loud twice. The affection I bearMamie Sue fattens in my heart at the same rate the object does in reallife."The way the two Willises impersonated their own silence was a triumphof art," the Idol said in my ear after it was over. It embarrassed megreatly to have him be obliged to crowd into a seat with LovelacePeyton and me, but it was crowded everywhere else, too. If I had hadmy way he would have had the best seat in the house, comfortablyalone.Sam Hayes was "Old Hickory," General Andrew Jackson, the night beforethe battle of New Orleans. Mr. Douglass Byrd wrote his piece and JudgeLuttrell, who is the son of one of that famous Tennessee hero's bestfriends and staff-officers, was so affected he blew his nosefeelingly.Pink would be a negro, so as for once to be rid--by the aid of burntcork--of the disgrace of his unmasculine beauty, and he was so likeUncle Pompey that Lovelace Peyton insisted on calling out to him fromthe second seat until Pink had to tell him who he was before he couldgo on with his hen story, which was one of Uncle Pompey's own, andwhich was rib-aching funny.Tony and Roxanne did the most interesting real Scout adventure,without words, and the audience sat spellbound while she fainted fromheat prostration, and he put around her head a wet bandage made withhis and her handkerchief, raised a signal for other Scouts to come andhelp, and finally took her up on his back and carried her off theplatform behind the curtain. The applause was deafening, thoughLovelace Peyton didn't like the scene one bit, and he kept feelingRoxanne's head after she came and sat down in front of us in theaudience.Nobody knew that I was going to be or do a thing, for I had beggedthem not to make me, because of the difficulty I have in managing myfeet and elbows on account of their rapid growth right now. But I did!I think I have caught the family pride habit and that is what made medo it. This is how I felt. I looked down at the seats of honorreserved for the Byrdsville distinguished citizens, and saw my fathersitting in one of the high places, as it were, between Judge Luttrelland Mr. Chadwell, and his face was just beaming with enjoyment of theway all those other men's sons and daughters were distinguishingthemselves with their beauty and talent. And then out in the audienceJudge Luttrell had Tony's mother, dressed in lovely black silk andalso full of pride, while Mr. Chadwell kept nodding to Pink's motherat everything that Pink did, like there never had been a negrominstrel before. I thought of Father being the only lonely one up onthe platform and with only me to be a credit to him--and me not doingit. I prayed for an immediate plan and as I prayed, as is my custom, Iacted. I asked Mr. Douglass Byrd quick, if there was time for me to doan impersonation, and he answered with the most wonderfullyencouraging smile:"Go ahead, Miss Phyllis, and you can heat them all."Now, the only person in the world I could ever be like is my own self,or Father himself, and as I sat and looked at him the idea came. Lastyear the governess took me to hear Father make a speech when hepresented a library building to the college from which he graduated.It was such a fine one and full of so much humor and pathos, as allspeeches should be to hold the attention of an audience, that it waspublished in all the papers in New York, and I learned it by heartfrom pride over it. That was what I impersonated--my own father withhim looking on!All the others had had costumes and burnt cork and things to helpthem; but I had on a pink flowered organdie and pink slippers with ahuge pink bow on my head, and my looks were all dead against mysuccess. But I did succeed! I knew I would when I took my stand andlooked down into Father's surprised and alarmed face. I shrugged myshoulders in my dress just as he did in his dress coat, dropped myhead on one side, and pursed my mouth up on the left corner and let myright eye droop as his does. Then I began--and for that five minutes I_was_ Father. The speech just rolled off my eloquent tongue andthe people laughed in the right places, just as the people at thecollege did, and the Colonel blew his nose like a trumpet when I saidthe short sentences about the memorial table to be put in the hallwayto the "fellows who have gone," while the end-up, with its funnylittle dedication to the immortals bound in leather that would live onthe library shelf and the ones hound in serge and corduroy that wouldsit at the tables in reading-room, brought the storm of applause thatsounded like a tornado.When I stopped being Father and came to my own self I was sittingbeside the Idol in the audience and watching Judge Luttrell slapFather on the back and Mr. Chadwell laughing so that he and theColonel looked like jolly, bald-headed boys. Mr. Chadwell is asdisgracefully handsome as Pink, and doesn't look much older. And Inever saw my father's face look like it did to-night, and I had neverhoped to see him in a position that fitted him like the one on theplatform with Byrdsville's distinguished citizens. I ought to be ahappy girl, and I am.Only Tony Luttrell troubles me, he is so quiet for him; and when hewalked home with me, he was as gentle and affectionate to me as if Ihad been sick. Could something be the matter with me and I not knowit? I felt like I did when the secret was first stolen two weeks ago,though Roxanne and the Idol seem to have forgotten all about it andnobody else knows.There is such a lovely moon out over the garden that I can't put outthe light and go to bed, though I saw Roxanne put hers out a half-hourago. I wonder why I ever started a record of myself and my friendslike I am doing? But I'm glad I did; for as I turn each leaf of you,leather Louise, things seem to get brighter and happier for me, and asI look at all these clean sheets in the future I wonder what I canfind to make them as lovely as the happenings on the others have been.I'm thankful for the air that makes Mother sleep, and for the moralsurroundings for Father, and for the loving-kindness of myfellow-men--girls and boys--to me. Yes, I realize that being belovedis a novelty to me, but I know better than to think it will ever wearoff--the pleasures of it, I mean. Good-night!CHAPTER VIIWhen you live in the city, or various cities, as I have done, you havevarious things that distract your attention from the miracle that isspreading all over the earth when the spring comes. Do such thingshappen every spring, or is it just something that has unblinded myeyes? Maybe I have really caught that rosy hue habit from Roxanne; butthe apple-trees this week have been almost too much for me. There aregreat, gnarly, old apple-trees in every spare corner of Byrdsville,where you wouldn't even expect a tree to be; and ever since I havebeen in this town I have been finding a new one stretching out itscrooked old arms to me as if to welcome me or bar my path. There isone that grows half in and half out of Judge Luttrell's yard, so thefence has to consider it a kind of post and stop at it to begin againon the other side, while three of them are trying to completely closeup the door of the court-house on the Public Square. All the streetsare bordered with them, set along at ragged intervals with the tallold maples, and all the gardens and yards have regiments of themcamped about the doors and walks.Three nights ago I went to sleep in a nice orderly old town, and Iawoke the next morning in the middle of a great white and pink andgreen bouquet, which must smell up at least to the first of the sevenheavens, and which is buzzing so with bees that it sounds like anorchestra getting ready to burst out into some kind of a new, greathymn. And everybody in Byrdsville is buzzing around in a chorus withthe bees, cleaning house and going visiting and shopping at the storesdown on the Square. I am as industriously doing likewise as I can, andhave bought things from almost everybody until my brain is feeble fromtrying to think up things to ask for in the different stores. Oh, thethings I could buy if Roxanne would just let me!One trouble is, there are no really poor people in Byrdsville, andthose on the verge of it are taken care of by the different churchsocieties, which look after them so carefully that they come very nearstepping on each others' toes. The incident of old Mr. and Mrs.Satterwhite came near being a case in point. Mr. Satterwhite hasalways been a Presbyterian, and Mrs. Satterwhite disagreed with herhusband seriously enough to be a Methodist. They have no children andhave been getting poorer and poorer, though keeping both honest andgood, except for their religious differences. When the cold weathercame this winter, they had no coal to keep their respectiverheumatisms warm and they nearly froze to death arguing about whichone of their respective church societies they should ask help from;and when they were both chattering cold they compromised on askingboth. Then they got two loads of coal, which was more than theyneeded, and which offended both societies, so that when they asked forsome kindling to light the fire with, both societies said let theother one send it. They had to sit up all night by turn for the restof the winter to keep the fire, for fear it would go out while theywere asleep.Roxanne and I were terribly distressed that such a hard thing as beingnight watchman should happen to those old people, but the Idol said itwas just as well that one should sleep while the other watched, sothat they wouldn't have any mutual time to discuss religion. That wasa very practical view for a genius to take of the question and I wassurprised at him.And while the situation looks very bad for churches to get into, ithas been fortunate for me. I have been able to buy a lot of things atall the stores for them, because I am an Episcopalian, and just onegirl can't be considered a church society. I'm the only one of my kindin town. Roxanne has helped me and we have bought with discretion aswell as liberality, I think. After we had bought all the groceriesUncle Pompey could suggest to us, and in quantities as large as wouldgo into all the corners of the kitchen of the Satterwhites' littlecottage, we began to make the house as beautiful as we thought thosegood old people deserved, never having had anything beautiful in alltheir lives before.First, we put the most expensive paper on all the walls, because wefound that the largest-flowered paper was what we needed, and ithappened to be a special kind that the paper man had to order bytelegram to be sent by express; for neither we, nor those old peoplewho are approaching the ends of their lives, could afford to wait. Itlooked lovely when it was all on and it matched the velvet carpets,which also had big flowers, good and gay.Of course, both Roxanne and I know better than to choose plushfurniture, but that was what Mrs. Satterwhite wanted, and they weregoing to live in the cottage, not us. Father was pleased when I toldhim what a big bill there would be at the furniture man's and said:"Good for you, Phil. I didn't think you could do so well as that."It took nearly two weeks of all our spare time, with Mamie Sue, whenshe could escape Belle, helping and Tony occasionally, to get theSatterwhites settled in their luxury; and then I decided to ask themboth seriously and separately if there was another desire of theirhearts left ungratified."Well," said Mr. Satterwhite, as he stretched his feet in his newvelvet slippers that matched the carpet in that room, "I'd like anice, new Methody hymn-book to be put on the table for the old lady toread outen on Sunday evenings."It was a glorious thing to think that Father's money, ill-gotten as itis, could settle the church society quarrel; and I was so delightedthat I am afraid I showed excitement when I went into the kitchen toask Mrs. Satterwhite what she would like best now that the needs wereall satisfied."Miss Phyllis, child, there is only one thing on earth I can thinkof to want. I would like to have a year's subscription to the_Presbyterian Observer_ to read to Pa on Sunday nights, like I usedto when we was young and strong and working enough to afford the twodollars." Remember, leather Louise, he is the Presbyterian and she isthe Methodist, so this was permanent reconciliation.My emotions are such that I can't write further about this incident,but I wish I could picture Father's face when I told him about it,'though still he wasn't satisfied and said spend some more. How couldI in a place where everybody had what they wanted and money is notneeded to make them enjoy life?My trouble was serious and I have had to confess to Roxanne about it."I wish I could give all the girls and boys in the class a nicepresent for some reason I haven't got," I said wistfully. "To Belleespecially, for she has been so pleasantly not unpleasant to me forthe last two weeks.""Yes, it is a pity, if you have to spend all that money in gettingother people what they want, that you can't get Belle's permanentpleasantness. It is something that would do us all good," answeredRoxanne, with the sympathy that I always find in her."Friendship that you have to buy would not be very valuable, generallyspeaking," I answered, as I shook my brain for a plan. "But on theother hand," I continued, "some people can see friendship in the formof a present when they can't feel it from the heart. Belle is thatkind, and that is not my fault. What I want to find is a 'tie to bindher'--speaking hymnally.""Yes, you are right, Phyllis," answered Roxanne thoughtfully, as sheand I both began to sew some little hand-made tucks that are to trimthe waist of the lovely blue muslin that Roxanne bought herself, toour great joy. "I do wish we could think up something that would makeBelle understand how you appreciate her and--"But just here the Idol came and stood in the door with Lovelace Peytonon his shoulder, whom he let slide down him to the floor. Now, a monthago, I would rather have had anything happen to me than to sit in thepresence of Mr. Douglass Byrd, but all that reverential awe hasgone--changed, the awe gone and only reverence left. As we feared, hehas bought the new spring clothes, but we see no alarming signs ofaffection toward Helena Kirby yet developed by them. How magnificenthe is in them, is beyond my pen to describe to you, Louise."What has Miss Belle done that needs an expression of appreciation onjust this particular day of May?" he asked, with that delightfulinterest he always shows in all of us--Roxanne's friends.And while it is trying in a way to girls whose dresses are still justat their shoe tops to be called "Miss," we never resent it from him,because it denotes real respect and not teasing like it does from someof our friends and older relations. It is a very thin line thatseparates ridicule from affectionate interest in girls of our age, buthe is always on the right side."The reason Phyllis wants to do something nice for Belle is that shehas the kind of disposition that requires more to make her a friendthan the rest of us. It has to be something that will shock her intoseeing how fond of her Phyllis is." Roxanne's explanation was so wellexpressed that the Idol saw the point and reason immediately."You want to throw a kind of bombshell friendship into the camp of herprejudices, Miss Phyllis," he said with his mouth twitching with alaugh, as if he didn't know whether we would like it or not."Yes, that is just what I want--an explosion, and I can't think ofanything but a gold bracelet or a ring, neither of which is askyrocket," I answered with the flow of wit that always comes in thepresence of the Idol, and which, I am sure, is just a reflection ofhis genius."I know a explode that I can git you, Phyllie," said Lovelace Peyton,looking up from the bottle he was trying to get into his apron pocket,his attention having been caught by the word that interested hisscientific mind."Not the kind Miss Phyllis wants, bug-doctor," the Idol answered witha laugh, as he filled his bag with tobacco that he keeps in a queerold jar which the Douglass grandfathers brought from England beforethe Revolution."I _kin_ git a 'splode that Phyllie wants," answered LovelacePeyton indignantly. "Phyllie always wants what I git her, evensquirms; don't you, Phyllie?""Yes, I do," I answered quickly, for I can't even write how preciousto me is the way Lovelace Peyton treats me with confidence. He comesto me now just as he goes to Roxanne for things he wants, strings orsympathy, and I keep a supply of both on hand for him. And when hebrings dreadful bugs and things I never let my heart quake--that is,so he will notice it. A woolly caterpillar was the last test that Istood for him."I think, however," said the Idol as he prepared to go on back to theoffice, since he had only come up to the court-house on an errandabout something, "I think if I were you, Miss Phyllis, I would try aquiet little gold bracelet. Believe me, it will work."You have to consider the source of advice like you do that of thewater you drink, and then act accordingly. If Mr. Douglass Byrdadvised me to buy one of my friends a gold bracelet, I ought not tohesitate any longer than it takes to put on a hat and get mypocketbook. Besides, I hadn't got a single thing from Mr. Snider, whokeeps the jewelry shop and the cigar stand at the same time in thesame shop. He was very cordial and glad to see Roxanne and me, andtried to stretch out the attractiveness of his few jewels in a mostsurprising way. He had two gold bracelets in stock, one plain and theother with a red set in it that he thought was a ruby, but I knew itto be a garnet. The plain one was really lovely, but I knew the otherwould suit Belle better.When Roxanne tried on the plain one, her lovely dark eyes justsparkled, and I could see how she loved it; but I had had myexperience with the Byrds' pride and I didn't even offer it to her. Myself-denial brought its reward. There were two little beauty pins justalike with small pearls set along the bar. I bought them both. First,I pinned one in the tie of my middy and then, with sterndetermination, I handed one to Roxanne. She looked at me doubtfully,then blushed and pinned hers in exactly the same spot on the collar ofher middy, which had been made to match mine since the temporaryeasing of their financial strain. If she had defied me, I don't knowwhat I should have done, but I gave her a squeeze that was the mostgraceful one I have ever accomplished since I have commenced topractise demonstrations. No hero or ambassador ever felt so proud of adecoration on his own chest as I did of that pin on Roxanne's. It is atriumph for one person to be able to make friends despite another'shaughtiness and I felt that even the old portrait grandmother wouldhave been glad to have Roxanne make me so happy.Then I had an addition to my first plan. Ideas have a way of splittingoff and multiplying themselves like jellyfish do in the naturalhistory, if they are in favorable environment. I asked Mr. Snider toset all the jewelry trays upon the counter again; and beginning at thefirst one, I bought a nice token of my regard for all eleven of myclass at the Byrd Academy."Now, Roxanne," I said as I left the store, "I know that this actionof mine looks very vulgarly rich, and if anybody did it to me I wouldbe as mad as Tony and all the rest will be if I offer them thisjewelry without an explanation. But Mr. Snider and the seven childrenhe has are enough to excuse any amount of vulgarity. Cigars andjewelry are very little for that large family to thrive on, and thatwas forty-five dollars I spent. I should think my friends wouldsympathize with me in having to get rid of this money in a sensibleand charitable way, enough to take the tokens without any indignationwhen I explain it to them. Don't you think so?"Oh, Phyllis," said Roxanne, with the affection in her voice that Ihope I am never going to get accustomed to, "nobody would refuse to dojust like you want them to; and if they thought they could, you wouldmake them see that it would be mean to do it. They will all bedelighted with the presents. Can't you see Mamie Sue turning that ringaround and around on her finger?"I had bought a ring with a lovely green set in it for Mamie Sue inmemory of the many horsehair ones she has had to wear to piece out hermemory, which must be fat and lazy like she is herself. I am going tomake my presentation apologies to them all tomorrow while we eat lunchout on the flat rock in the academy yard. Sometimes we take a doublelunch and invite the boys to come over and share it with us. Roxanneand I have planned to do this. She is going to let Uncle Pompey makesome one of his favorites for us. She is still indulging him incooking materials, but thinks she will have to begin to starve againon June first. The new invention has got as far as needing somechemicals already. But it is best to climb away from an evil day uponthe ever convenient rosy cloud and that is what we did as we walkedalong toward home.But a strange thing happened, and funny, too. I'm blushing over myawkwardness even as I write just to you, leather Louise. But isn't itenough to make me blush to think of that scarf-pin, with the moonstoneand pearl in it, that I got to give Pink, sticking in the Idol'snecktie, if he hasn't already taken it off to go to bed? This is how ithappened. As we came along the street, almost as far as to MissPriscilla's, we met Tony and Mr. Douglass Byrd coming into town. Inever saw two people as much excited as they both were, and when theysaw us they stopped talking and looked at us like we were a surprise tothem. For a minute I was startled, for I thought I heard Mr. Roger'sname spoken excitedly by Tony; and I have never got over the uneasinessabout him, though the great secret robbery is a thing of two weekspast. I can't help anxiously wondering what they were talking about.They stopped, and so did we, and of course Tony's Scout eyes landedright on those twin pins Roxanne and I were wearing; and before I couldstop her Roxanne had told him about the present-luncheon out on theflat rock to-morrow, and Snider and how I _had_ to spend money. Ithought Tony was going to laugh and joke about it, as his formerconduct would have been; but he got red in the face, shook as I put hispin into the lapel of his coat and spoke to me as if I were ill andneeded sympathy, like he has been doing for a week. That was upsettingenough; but when the Idol looked at me with real affection beaming fromhis glorious eyes and said:"Don't I get a jewel, too, Miss Phyllis?" I almost doubled up into aheap on the pavement, and it was Roxanne who came to my rescue andheld all of them out for him to take his choice. He took the one Iwould rather have him take--a beautiful pearl, like my friendship isfor him, shadowed by the moonstone, which is my unworthiness.I'll go down early in the morning and get another pin for Pink. I wishFather was here so I could tell him about Mr. Snider and how glad hewas to get the money. "Tainted money" were the words the magazineused--wouldn't feeding hungry little children take the taint off themoney and the people who gave it? I believe so. I wish I had allFather's money to give away and he had to work for all we get, atsomething like being a lawyer or a doctor. This had been a lovely day,and I'm thankful for my happiness. Good-night!*       *       *       *       *Oh, why aren't people more careful about what they say beforechildren, who can't always understand all that things mean! I willnever forgive myself for bringing this awful thing down on Roxanne andher family as long as I live, though Mr. Douglass Byrd says it was notmy fault at all. He was the one that called the present for Belle anexplosion, and so put the idea into Lovelace Peyton's mind. Nobodyknows yet just exactly what did happen or how bad his eyes are hurt,but the light of all the world is going out for me if Lovelace Peytonis going blind so he never can be the famous doctor he was born to be.Old Uncle Pompey has been gasping with asthma in the kitchen sincemorning, and all he can tell is that Lovelace Peyton had taken somekerosene out of the can on the back porch, be thought to just mix withonions and other things he often uses to make medicines. Suddenly heheard an explosion in the back yard and ran out to find LovelacePeyton's face all burned and him insensible. When Roxanne got to himhe just moaned that he was making an explosion for me, and then thedoctor gave him something to keep him from suffering with the burnwhile he dressed it. They can't tell about the eyes as yet.[Illustration: He just moaned that he was making an explosion]Miss Prissy is with Roxanne, and they won't let me stay all night, soI had to come home. Roxanne just won't believe that he won't get allright, neither will Mr. Douglass Byrd. He was lovelier than ever tome, but with that same kind of flavor in his kindness that he and Tonyboth had yesterday. What can they be pitying me about?Father has been away a week and I am so sorry. I have just written tohim about the accident, and I know he will be distressed, for he wasas fond of Lovelace as of anybody he knew. I believe he'll come righthome.How can I go to sleep and wait until morning to know if those lovely,blue, little-boy eyes will never look up at me again? What can I do toease this awful anxiety? As if I didn't know what to do when I haveheard so often about a Person who watches every sparrow's flight.CHAPTER VIIIThese few days have been the most wonderful I have ever spent in allmy life, the saddest and the most deeply happy. When a person'sfriends are in trouble, it is one time you can let your heart go itsown pace no matter where it carries you, and for once I have had myway about pouring out my affection on the Byrds.Lovelace Peyton is not going to die from his dreadful burns, thedoctors say; but as yet they can't tell about his eyes. They don'tdare remove the bandages, and whether or not he can see cannot bedecided for a week or more. He has to stay in a dark room and be veryquiet, and it is like trying to prove that impossible is possible topersuade him into lying in his bed in Roxanne's room, while we exertourselves to the point of desperation to keep him happy and amused.Since the accident Roxanne and I have just ignored the Byrd ancestors,and I bring whatever I choose across the garden into the cottage toLovelace Peyton. In the first place, he wouldn't eat without me, andkept asking for things I had given him to eat; so I had to tellRoxanne about my dishonesty in feeding him like I had been doing, andshe was so glad that he was fat and in good condition to stand thestrain of his accident that she forgave me with her arms around myneck.I wish I could put down in black and white between your brown covers,leather Louise, how happy it makes me to sit by that squirming,bandaged little boy, and feed him out of one of his thin ancestralspoons. Not one thing will he eat without me. I believe he knows howhappy it makes me, and frets for me just for that special reason. Thatand the fact that he expects things of me made me think up the ideathat has helped us through the awfulness of the days that we had tokeep him quiet.Lovelace Peyton is not like the little boy to whom you can tellstories about bears and Little Red Ridinghood and Goldilocks inordinary form. He'll listen to it a few minutes, and then when youcome to the point where the grandmother is ill for Little RedRidinghood to go and visit, he stops and wants to know exactly whatwas the matter with her; and if you say you don't know, he turns overon his pillow and won't listen to the rest of it."Why don't folks write in books what diseases other folks have got,Phyllie?" he asked fretfully when I told him about Tiny Tim and the"Christmas Carol." "Do you reckon that little boy had rheumatiz anddidn't know any plaster for it?"I am really reverently thankful for the idea that popped into mysorely troubled head at that moment. Roxanne had gone out to walk inthe garden for a little rest, for she has had to talk to him most ofthe night and describe over and over what the burn on his arm lookedlike when the doctor dressed it. I was with him by myself for a fewminutes when I found the treasure of an idea."Lovelace Peyton," I said, with excitement in my voice more than thedoctor would have approved of, "would you like me to get a realdoctor's book and read you about each disease as it comes in the bookand just what the doctors use to cure it with?""Phyllie," he said, sitting up in bed and waving the poor bandagedhand with delight shining from under the bandage above his eyes, "yougo a running and git that book as fast as you kin. I will promise tolie right still and listen all day and all night forever. Hurry!"I called Miss Priscilla to come quick as I saw her turning in thegate, and I took my hat and started down-town for the only bookstorein Byrdsville, which is kept in the post-office by the post-master. IfI couldn't find a book about diseases there, I was determined to goand beg or borrow or steal one from the doctor himself. But I foundthe very one I wanted. It was called "First Aid in the Family," and itdescribed more accidents and diseases than it seemed possible formortal man to have. It was a large book and I was glad it cost fivedollars. The post-master said a man had left it there for him to sellsix months ago, and that it cost too much for most of the people inByrdsville to doctor by. He offered to send it as soon as his boy cameback, but I was in too much of a hurry to get back to Lovelace Peytonto wait, so I took it in my arms and started home with it.On the way I met Helena Kirby walking down-town with the Petway boy,and they looked right into my face and passed me without speaking. Itmight have been because I was carrying the big book, but I didn't knowHelena was that proud. It hurts me for people to treat me that waywithout any reason but just dislike for me and perhaps because theythink it wicked about Father's money.Just a little farther along I met Tony, and he took the book to carryfor me, and I told him about Helena and the Petway boy looking at meand not offering to speak to me. Tony got red up to the roots of hishair, being mad, and looked like he would just as soon as not eat themboth alive."Now, see here, Phyllis," he spluttered, "don't you pay one bit ofattention to what a pair of jolly idiots like those two do or say. Youare all right and we all know it. No matter what happens, we're foryou. See?""Thank you, Tony," I said gratefully, but I didn't "see," and I was sopuzzled over that "no matter what happens" that I felt weak in mybrain.In a few minutes still worse happened. Belle and Mamie Sue saw us, andBelle forcibly crossed Mamie Sue over and went down the side streetjust to keep from meeting us--that was as plain as day. Tony got stillredder and talked fast about Lovelace Peyton to keep from seeming tonotice the way the girls had acted toward us. I held up my head anddid likewise.Something awful has happened to me or about me in this town and Idon't know what; but it is my duty to put it all out of my mind nowand give my thoughts and cheerfulness to Roxanne and Lovelace Peyton,while they need me so much. I have made up my mind to forget it.And it was fun to read to the prostrated medicine-man out of that bookas I did all afternoon. I began with abscesses and got almost as faras aneurism before the sun began to set. I never saw anybody enjoyanything as much as Lovelace Peyton did each disease as I read aboutit; and the more bloodcurdling the description of the suffering andmore awful the treatment, the more it interested him."I bet if I ever get a good sharp knife, I could stick it right in thepain place in Uncle Pompey's heel so it would bleed all the soreaway," he said with keen enjoyment, as I read to him about the lancingof carbuncles."Oh, Lovey, I almost get the diseases while Phyllis reads about them,"said Roxanne with a shudder. "Do you like to hear about such awfulthings?""Yes, I do," answered Lovelace Peyton decidedly. "And I wisht youwould get every one of the diseases in that book, Rosy, so I couldcure you like Phyllis reads--and Uncle Pompey and Doug, too. Only notPhyllis, 'cause I need her to read the cure to me, while I do it."While we were all laughing at Lovelace Peyton and talking about theoperations he is going to perform on the inhabitants of Byrdsville assoon as he gets grown, and deciding what each one is going to have,the Idol came in and stayed with us until the soft gray twilight beganto come in the windows. He was so lovely and interesting that it wasquite dark when I remembered that I must go home. Then he walked overthrough the garden with me, and out there under the stars he told mewhat the doctor had told him in the afternoon. Old Dr. Hughes isafraid to experiment with Lovelace Peyton's eyes, and says that aspecialist must come from Cincinnati to examine them when they takeoff the bandages next week. Mr. Douglass has written to the doctor tosee what it will cost, and he doesn't want Roxanne to know about ituntil he hears whether the doctor will come and give him time to payfor it."Oh, I don't believe the bug-hunter is going to have any trouble withseeing all right again and we'll get the big doctor down here to seehim some way or other. Don't you worry, Miss Phyllis; I just told youbecause you are the best friend of all concerned, and I couldn't doanything without consulting you. See?" he asked, in the sameprotecting tone of voice that Tony had used in the afternoon whenBelle and Mamie Sue did me that way.After I was undressed I felt that I just must go into my mother's roomfor a minute; and I begged so hard that the night nurse who is a verykind lady, let me creep in for just a few seconds. I have got a theoryabout Mother and myself. I believe she knows when I am in the room,even if she can't show it by moving or even opening her eyes, and itis a comfort to her and me both to have me come and kneel at the footof her bed well out of sight. I did get comforted to-night, too, andthe thought that did it was this. If Father and I don't do as well asother people in the world, and get rich and do things that we oughtnot to, we have not had her to direct and control and comfort us likeshe would have done if she could; and no wonder we have strayed. Amotherless girl and a wifeless man ought not to be judged in the sameway other people are. I feel better now, and I'm leaving it all toGod, who understands such situations as mine and Father's. Good-night,leather friend.*       *       *       *       *Somewhere back on your pages, Louise, I wrote that I was going to bethankful for the happiness and friends that I had, no matter whathappened, and I am. It has happened. I am the lonely little child thatgot a peep through the high, barred gate into the garden where otherchildren were playing in the sunshine, and then was put out into thedark street again. I ought not to say that, though, when I have gotMr. Douglass Byrd for a star in my darkness, as he has made himself bythe way he has treated me.I am glad I stopped by on my way to school this morning to see Roxanneand Lovelace Peyton while I was their light-hearted companion still:now I am a woman of sorrows and disgrace. Also, I am glad, if the blowhad to be dealt me, it was Belle who did it, and not Mamie Sue nor oneof the two Willises, nor anybody else. I have always had a strangefeeling about that bracelet with the red set, anyway, and I am notsurprised that she struck me with it."Miss Forsythe," she said, as she held it out to me all wrapped up intissue paper and tied with a blood red string, "I will have to returnyour present to you, with thanks. I cannot keep a bracelet given me bya girl whose father would go like a chicken thief and rob a neighbor'sshed of a valuable thing like an invention. Please excuse me!"For a minute I stood struck dumb, and watched Belle's pink ginghamskirt switch as she walked through the door of the school-room. Theyhad all the lunch spread on the flat rock, and I thought were waitingfor me while I put my desk in order just after the bell rang. And evenwhile I watched Belle I was conscious of Mamie Sue's fat expression ofdistress as she paused with a biscuit spread with jam half-way to hermouth. The Willis girls looked struck even dumber than usual, and asif they didn't know what to do. I didn't give them a chance to decideon anything. I picked up my hat from the ground and walked out thegate with my head as high, as if my honor had not been laid low.I was walking just as fast as I could past the cottage, hoping thatnobody would see me before I got here to my room to realize my agonymyself, when Roxanne ran out of the door to catch me at the gate."Oh, Phyllis, don't look like that," she exclaimed as she drew methrough the gate and behind the big lilac bush that is full of purpleblooms. "It doesn't make one bit of difference to me, and I love youjust the same. Who told you?""Belle," I answered, trying to keep my face and voice steady. "Whofound it out, Roxanne?""Oh, Tony scouted it all out, though he didn't mean to. It was thatawful smelly bottle Lovey gave your father. Tony smelled it talking toMr. Forsythe at the gate and then again in the shed. He couldn'tconnect them at first; but after a while he remembered, and then hebegan to suspect something awful--he oughtn't to have done it, but hedid. He followed your father and Mr. Rogers out to the furnaces onenight and--saw Mr. Rogers explain it to your father. Then Mr. Forsythewent away the next morning and Douglass began to watch Mr. Rogers, andjust three days after that he found him out at the furnace at nightwith a workman getting some of the ovens ready to try the experiments.He couldn't do a thing, and had to let them take his discovery and doas they wanted to. Oh, truly Phyllis, it doesn't make a bit ofdifference in our love for you.""How did Belle find it out, and why should they think Father isdishonest--even if Rogers is?" I asked, still as cold as ice though myhead seemed to be on fire."That is what is nearly killing Tony," answered Roxanne, with a sobbeginning to come in her voice; but she still held on to me tight, asstiff as I was. "He and Douglass have known it for a week, and theynever wanted anybody else to know about it on your account. Douglasssays he would rather give up ten fortunes than hurt such a friend asyou have been to us, but Tony let the secret get out by accident, andnow all the town knows it. Judge Luttrell is getting out aninjunction, even if Douglass won't sign it, and the Colonel is gettingready to go on the next train to find your father and--and remonstratewith him, he says.""Tony didn't tell Belle about it on purpose, did he?" I asked to besure. "I couldn't have stood that.""Oh, no, it was Mamie Sue that found out part, and told Belle, withoutknowing she had done it, just yesterday. Mamie Sue says she wishes shenever had any eyes or ears or anything to taste with, then maybe shewould never get into trouble. It is all on account of people thinkingshe is more stupid than she is. Tony told Douglass right before her,on the street while she was giving both of them some of that fudge shehad made to bring Lovelace Peyton, that Mr. Rogers had been in thetelegraph office and had telegraphed your father that the experimentnight before last was a success. Tony is ambitious as a Scout shouldalways be and has learned to read the ticking of the telegraph."'Anyway, Doug, it's a cinch that you have made one of the greatestpractical inventions of the day,' Tony said, forgetting Mamie Sueentirely and so did Douglass, as he answered:"'That's true, Raccoon, and if the fortune is another man's byrobbery, the brains are mine. I'll get my share yet. Wait until thisnew idea gets into shape.'"And then Roxanne went on to say that Mamie Sue said they hardlyremembered her enough to politely thank her for the fudge, as theywalked away talking. She went on down to Belle's; and when Belle beganto say that Tony was stupid because he couldn't read his Cicero,Friday, she tried to defend him by telling how he can read telegraphyeven if he can't read Latin.Belle was mean enough to get it all from Mamie Sue without Mamie Suesuspecting that she was telling anything that would hurt me; and Belletold Helena and Helena told the ladylike Petway, who told his father,who told Judge Luttrell before night. The Judge sent for the Idolbefore breakfast this morning and told him that he was an idiot to letsuch a thing be stolen and he is beginning all kinds of prosecutionsand things against Father, though my noble hearted friend won't signthem on account of his esteem for me. And, of course, the whole townknows of it and is excited. It is not astonishing that Byrdsville iswild to find out that it has reared a great inventor, only to have hisfirst fruits stolen. I feel with Byrdsville, even if they feel againstme. Some of this Roxanne told me and some of it is my own surmise thatcame to me as we stood behind that old lilac bush."I don't believe it, but if it is true, you won't let your father'shaving done my brother that way make any difference in the way youlove us, Lovey and Douglass and me, will you, Phyllis? We just needyou that much more to help us through with the starving and freezingfor the new invention that we are going to take better care of."Through all my misery I ask myself if any girl in the whole wide worldever had a friend like Roxanne Byrd?And as if having Roxanne hold me in both arms and love me beyond mywildest expectations was not enough, what should happen to me? TheIdol came around the bush full of blooms where we stood, and didlikewise. He put his long arms around Roxanne and me and hugged usboth up like we were not any bigger than Lovelace Peyton."You two precious kiddies are not to pay any attention to disagreeablethings that are not any of your business," he said in his wonderfulvoice that was as big and booming and comforting as any anthem sung inchurch where a sinner goes for help. That's what it sounded like tome."That's what I tell Phyllis, Douglass--she's more valuable than theloss of any kind of a big fortune, that we really don't need at all tomake us happy, while we do need her." Roxanne was laughing and cryingand hugging me so that she got herself mixed in her words in aperfectly beautiful and loving way.I am glad that my affection for these kind friends inspired me so thatI could answer them like I wanted to--at least I tried so hard to sayhow I felt that I almost succeeded."You are both the best friends that were ever created for a lonelygirl," I answered, drawing out of both pairs of arms, and looking themboth square in the face. "But I am my father's daughter and mustsuffer for his sins, if he has them. If he has done this dreadfulthing, which I don't believe, then I don't deserve your friendliness,and I can't take what it is not right for me to have. I'm going homeand stay there until he comes, and then if he can't explain and has topay any penalty I'm going to do it with him.""Oh, Phyllis, and what will Lovey do without you?" Roxanne begged,using the strongest thing she could have said to me when I thought ofthe little blind boy that wanted and needed me so badly."You will punish him and us for something we can't help," the Idolsaid to me with reproach in his eyes and voice that nearly killed me."You both have had your kind of pride about taking gifts from me eversince I have known you," I answered, looking them full in the eyes,"and you have taught me what the word means. I could take things toeat and wear from you, but my kind of pride won't let me take yourfriendship when you think my father has treated you like this.Good-by! I can't stay any longer to be tortured." And with that Iturned and walked away from them both, forever, I am afraid.It isn't true, it can't be! But if it is? One thing I have made up mymind to do: I am going to ask Father, if it is all true, to let me goaway from Byrdsville. I can't stay here; it will be too empty a lifefor me to watch them living with me out of it. I hope he will go andtake Mother too. Judge Luttrell may prosecute him so he will have to.Is this the end of the life that bloomed out in me like the appleblossoms do on the bare trees, only to be shattered? No! I hope I willbear fruit from having had so much happiness, like the apple-trees dofrom their blooms, and I'm going to try.*       *       *       *       *Just here I laid down Louise and went to see what I could see going ondown at the cottage before dark. And there was old Uncle Pompeyhanging over our garden wall smoking his pipe and just crying into hisfunny red bandanna handkerchief. Something tells me that he is goingto miss me very much also. I am thankful for the love of this oldnegro, which I am sure is just the same quality as if he were white.I think if I could just steal in for one minute and look at LovelacePeyton's little bandaged head it would make the pain in my hearteasier for having to give him up, but even that I can't do. I've foundhow strong pride is as well as bitter.CHAPTER IXOf course, I know that there are many strange things in life that seemto contradict each other and themselves in a very puzzling manner, butmy disgrace has turned out in a way that nobody could have made mebelieve, if they had told it to me in dictionary words of sixsyllables. I am being befriended and honored by the whole ofByrdsville, and I don't know what to make of it. My mind refuses toexplain it and my heart is just going on rejoicing over it, as I havenot been able to think up any reason why it shouldn't.Everybody now knows about the steel process that their distinguishedcitizen, Mr. Douglass Byrd, invented; and they all believe that Fatherhas had it stolen and has left Byrdsville for some place where ColonelStockell can't find him, but they are none of them mad at me about it.Of course, a load of sympathy can be as heavy to bear as one ofdisgrace; and when you have both the two to stagger under, you maywobble some in your conduct, as I have done these last two days.First, though my reason is convinced about Father, there is somethingin me that just won't believe it, and that keeps making me hope, andbe passive in life, until he comes. I say nothing about it to anybody,because the proof is too great against him, and I suppose it is reallymore daughterly love than hope. Anyway, it is a precious feeling tome.But one thing that troubles me is the way one friend's sorrow canthrow its shadow over the lives of many others. It troubles me thatTony and Roxanne and the Colonel and some of the others are distressedabout me, especially Tony. He came to see me the morning after Bellehad told me all about his scouting out the secret; and if it hadn'tbeen such an occasion I would have had to laugh at the collapsed wayhe looked, like he would fall to pieces if you touched him even verygently. His grin was so entirely gone that his mouth looked only thesize of an ordinary human being's, and his eyes were shut down sodolefully that they were funnier than ever."Go on, Bubble, and shake me," he said, with a comical sadness thatwas hard to bear with proper respect. "Play I'm a doormat if you wantto, but I cross my heart and body I didn't mean to hurt you by lettingmy mouth overwork at the wrong time. The Dumpling is just a spongethat sops up any old thing and lets any old body squeeze it out ofher. Please say you forgive me.""Why, Tony," I said with difficult but becoming gravity, "don't youknow that I know that you didn't mean to do anything to hurt me?" Icouldn't bring myself to mention Father or the shameful circumstancesand I hoped he wouldn't, either.Tony is not a mere boy; he is a kind gentleman, also, and he ignoredthe subject we were discussing just as carefully as I did."Good for you, girliky, and I hope you fully realize that this littleold burg of Byrdsville is all for you and anxious to hop rig-lit intoyour pocket," he said most picturesquely, with relief at my not beinghurt at him beginning to pull the corners of his mouth into the grinthat he had put away as not suitable for the occasion.A person who has the smile habit fixed on his face is a very valuablefriend, and I was glad to see Tony put on his grin again. There weretwo or three questions I wanted to ask him when he was in his normalcondition, and I was just going to consult him about whether itwouldn't be easier for the other girls and boys for me not to go toschool--anyway until they found Father and his innocence, or knew theworst about the prosecution and other punishments that would be givenhim; but before I could get the words arranged in my mind to say justwhat I wanted to say, he began on something like the same subjecthimself."See here, Phyllis, Roxy told me that you hadn't been in to jolly thebug-grubber to-day at all, and the poor little bubble is worried aboutwhat she thinks is going to be a grouch in your system," he said,looking at me with so much confidence in my good disposition shiningin his face, that it was painful to try to make him understand justhow the pride disease I had caught from the Byrds was affecting me."Indeed you know, Tony, that it is not because I don't love Roxanneand Lovelace Peyton that I haven't been there this morning; but I justdon't think it is right for me to be taking their friendship and lovewhen everybody thinks my own father has injured them, as he has not.It is right for me to suffer for what they think he has done, until weknow better, and my pride won't let me take any more of theiraffection when I may not deserve it." I looked away while I wastalking to Tony, for I hated to see the shock fade the grin. I alsohated to bring up the subject we were ignoring."Oh, fudge and fiddlesticks, Phyllis, don't let any old sour idea likethat ball up your naturally sweet temper. You and Roxy are just womenfolks and had better keep out of men's business, like this wranglebetween Doug and Mr. Forsythe. Trot along and do your stocking-darningand pie-fixing together as per usual schedule. And as to thismix-up--forget it!""I know, Tony, that Roxanne and I are just children--and what isworse, just girls--but I have to do what I think is honorable underthese circumstances; and taking friendliness from Roxanne now would bejust charity--I can't do it." As I spoke I felt my head straightenitself after the manner of the grandmother portrait, just as if I hadbeen born a Byrd."Now, who would have thought that you could 'throw a crank' like that,Phyllis--a girl who could brace another girl as hefty as Roxy upon hershoulder to save the whole town and Dr. Snakes from being dynamited?I'm disappointed in you.""Why, how did you know about that explosion that Lovelace Peytonalmost blew us all into pieces with?" I asked with astonishment."Roxy sniffled it all to me this morning when she was pouring out hertrouble because you hadn't been over to cheer up the bugger to-day.She told Pink and Sam and Belle and the Sponge and me all about it,and I can tell you we thrilled some. By acclamation we have electedyou to lead the Kitten Patrol of the Campfire that we Scouts have beentalking about helping you bubbles set up for a month. We have alreadydecided to put you in command of the girls, because we can then expectsome real good stand-bying in case of Scout trouble or excitement. Wemeet in the Crotch to-night to decide all the details." Tony's eyeswere shining and flaring and his red hair standing straight up in hisfriendly excitement.Honors are mighty apt to shock a person when they come unexpectedly,and I don't believe expected ones bring half the joy that the surpriseones do. I feel humble to think that in less than a year the boys andgirls of a place like Byrdsville have found me worthy of theleadership of such a sacred thing as a Girl Scout company will be.For, of course, of all the things that boys ever were in the world,nothing is so wonderful as being Scouts like so many hundreds andhundreds have been made all over the United States in the last threeyears. And when the Boy Scouts do all the noble things in the nobleway they do, what will be expected of the girls, now that they arebeing let Into the organization? The boys have to pledge themselves tobe clean and honorable and kind and just and charitable and brave; so,of course, the girls will have to be all that and still more. Could I?I sat still and thought for a long time, and Tony, with his knowledgeof girls, let me do it. Could I? Could a girl with a father that mighthave done the thing that my father is suspected of having done to afellow-man, promise to be all or any of those things? How would sheknow that some little thing in her, like her father, wouldn't come up,just at the time when she was being depended on, to make her fail?This distinction was not for me!"Tony," I said quietly, and I didn't let the tremble in my heart getinto my voice at all, "whatever happens to me in my life I can't everforget that you offered to make me the leader of the Campfire, but--Ican't be it. Please don't make me say any more about it. I can't."Tony understood. "Not a word more on the subject, Bubble; but I dowant to say that you are one fine--"But just here we were interrupted by Mamie Sue coming lumbering acrossthe wall from the Byrd cottage, for Tony and I had been sitting on abench out under the blooming peach-tree arbor. She sat pretty close tome and gave me a nice, good, fat-armed hug as she offered me a paperbag."Have some fudge, Phyllis," was all she said; but I saw Belle walkingdown the street with her head in the air and her skirts switching likeHelena's and I knew that Mamie Sue had come through a hard fight to befriends with me. I can't say how I appreciated it, and I love MamieSue. Maybe she is not very smart, but a person that always hassweetness of disposition and in paper bags to offer a friend introuble ought to be appreciated. And just as I had got hold of hernice big right arm to return the hug, around the other side of thehouse came Pink and Sam, with Miss Priscilla in between them."Phyllis dear," said Miss Prissy, as all of us got up to give her aseat, though she only took Tony's and part of mine, while the boys saton the grass, "the boys are telling me about the Girl Scout ideas. Ithink it is naughty of them to say they are going to name you theKitten Patrol, especially as your rescue of Lovey Byrd is more thanlikely to give you a life-saving medal to start with, as soon as theColonel writes to New York about it.""A medal--a--a medal like Tony's?" I gasped, as my heart stood stillin awe of my own act."Why, of course, Bubble, you will get a medal," said Tony, with thedelight that some boys might not have shown at the idea of a girl'sgetting up to the same height of distinction that they had attained."Now, will you be good and be the leader of the Kittens?""Say, Phyllis, when you raised Roxy from the ground, did you use theother muscles of your body or depend a lot on the shoulder lift?" Samis not so big and strong as the other boys and consequently has thegreatest regard for the strength that he hasn't got.I could only say that I didn't know what I had lifted Roxanne up tocatch the bottle with--except prayers.And while they all sat there in my garden and talked with MissPriscilla about what she should get the Colonel to write toheadquarters about me and about the dynamite and the steel andeverything that was indirectly related to my disgrace, I sat quiet andprayed for some sort of strength to tell them that I maybe couldn't bea Scout, and couldn't have a medal and was hoping to move away fromthem to some other place to live, just as I had learned to like thembetter than I had dreamed one could like friends.These boys and girls, including Miss Priscilla, haven't been used tohaving things happen to them to distress them, and they are sowarm-hearted and sympathetic that it makes it hard to say a thing tothem that would hurt them. But I couldn't, couldn't go on being apublic and distinguished character, if my father were going to be apublic character of another kind. If people should say, "How his lifemust mortify his poor daughter, noble girl, with a medal and friendsand things!" that would just put me on the other side of the fencefrom my own parent, who needs me more than ever, if he is sinful. Heisn't, but what right have I to bask in public favor while he is inouter darkness?Then just as I was going to decline to be a member of the Campfire andbeg them all not to mention it to me any more, and try not to worryover me but to just forget about me, something so horrible came overthe wall, in the shape of the news that Mr. Douglass Byrd brought,that I and they forgot all about the Scouts and Kittens and medals andall that. The Idol was pale and quiet as he walked up the path to us,after skimming over the wall with one hand on it in a way that madeSam gasp with admiration. He looked past Miss Priscilla and the restof his old friends of inherited generations in Byrdsville and straightat me, his new--but adoring--one."Miss Phyllis," he said, with such sadness in his voice that Mamie Suegulped over a piece of fudge worse than usual, "Dr. Hughes has justexamined Lovey's eyes and it has hurt him very much--also he thinksthe sight has gone. The youngster is crying and fretting for you andthey don't want him to do that under any circumstances. The only hopefor his sight will be for him not to inflame his eyes. Will you come?"Would I go--would I go across the dead body of my father's honor andmy own and anybody's disgraces and any other old thing? I went soquickly that I upset Mamie Sue on the one side and Miss Priscillaalmost on the other, and I didn't even wait to answer the Idol in thereverent and respectful manner that is always his due and that Ialways observe. Down that garden path I flew and over that wall Iskimmed, like a bird with wings, or like the Idol himself, and in solittle a time that I didn't even realize the journey, I was inRoxanne's room with her in one of my arms and Lovelace Peyton squeezedup in the other.Roxanne choked her sobs down in my neck and I choked mine down in myheart as the little doctor kicked one fat little knee out from underthe cover and began to squeal like a queer kind of pig as one of hisarms went around and around."That's the way I cried when that old Dr. Hughes hurt my eyes to make'em well, Phyllie, and you wasn't here to see him do it and tell mehow red they looked and if they had got any blue around the edges likea carbuncle. Roxy can't tell disease like you kin, and now you wasaway from 'em and didn't see the nice ones I have got in both eyes."The reproach in his voice was so funny and yet so sad that Roxanne andI both choked still more and held on to each other tight. I justsimply couldn't say a word, and I was again made ashamed by thatunruly lump in my throat that never seems to come unless something isthe matter with the Byrds."I'm hungry, too, for some of the nice sweet charlock rookster thatyour cook makes me and I eats in the afternoon, right now. I waked upin the night and wanted it and you, too, Phyllie, and I wouldn't haveold Doug or Roxy, neither. Now, it is always night time and Roxywouldn't go and call you. Won't you stay with me always and read meabout smallpox like you promised?"Always night now!" Again Roxanne and I hugged and choked, but thistime I had to conquer the lump and answer him."Indeed, indeed, Lovelace Peyton, I'm never going to leave you anymore, only to go and get the things you want. Can't I go and get thecharlotte russe for you now?""No, Phyllie," he exclaimed, grasping with his strong little fingersmy hand that lay on his pillow. "I wants smallpox now worser than I docharlocks. Then Tony can come and let me tie bandages around his legwhile you go git the rookster and maybe some nice cake and oranges andcandy. No; Dumpie bringed me candy. You git more rags to tie up folkswith. I want to fix Doug's head good 'fore he goes to bed. But readthe smallpoxes right away. Begin where they throws up."Roxanne got the book while I drew a chair by the bed and sat down toit, with gratitude drying the tears in my heart, for being forced intoforgetting my pride and coming back to them again. Roxanne sat by meand held my left hand until we got to the worst part of the smallpox,and then she got pale around the mouth and went out of the room."Read the sickest part again, Phyllie, and then turn and read themedicine for it," he had just demanded when she fled.And for the rest of the afternoon I sat by him and went through allthe different stages of smallpox until, feeling each one acutely as Idid, it is a wonder I was not pock-marked. When he fell asleep at lasthe was holding fast to one of my hands for fear I would get away withthe precious book.When I could slip his fingers from mine, I tried to steal tiptoethrough the hall so as not to wake Roxanne, who was lying asleep, Ihoped, on the sofa in the hall, but she opened her great, troubled,dark eyes and saw me before I got to the door."Oh, Phyllis," she said and held out her arms to me. Somehow it seemsto me I have learned very quickly how to take a person I love in myarms without awkwardness--that is for a girl who never had anybody totake before--and I sat down and snuggled Roxanne in a mannercomfortable to us both. "Do you think it is possible that Lovey isgoing to be--be blind?" she asked me in a small voice that couldhardly dare utter the horrible words."I came in such a hurry when Mr. Douglass Byrd called me that I didn'tquite understand what Dr. Hughes said or found," I answered."When he took the bandages off, Lovey didn't seem to see at all, butthe lids are still so swollen that he is not sure they are closed. Idon't believe he knows what to do, Phyllis, and that is what scaresme. But is there any great thing a blind man can do except be amusician? Lovey can't sing much."I verily believe that Roxanne Byrd would have gone on and planned somekind of a career of blind genius for Lovelace Peyton while waiting tosee if he was to lose his eyes, if the Idol hadn't come into the hallat that moment.He moved Roxanne over and sat down between us and began to talkseriously to us, like I was a valued member of the Byrd family."I have just had a long talk with Dr. Hughes, and he says thatLovelace Peyton will have to have a specialist examine his eyes anddirect the treatment, if the sight is to be saved. We will have tothink up a plan to get a great doctor from Cincinnati down toByrdsville, Tennessee.""But it will cost so much and where--?" Roxanne stopped quickly forfear of hurting the Idol's feelings and not from my presence. One ofthe great things about the Byrds is that they can forget riches insuch a way as not even to know or realize that they haven't them."We'll get it," answered the Idol with his heroic look, the like ofwhich I do not believe a man ever owned before. "Things are going togo straight, now that Miss Phyllis has got the bugger all happy withthe medical course again. What would all of us do without her?" Hestood up to light his pipe and his fingers trembled.Anybody else but a great man, born of a great family like the Byrds,would have hurt my feelings by saying apologetic things about thetragedy between us, but the Idol just ignored it and I was made one ofthem again in their trouble. Suddenly something popped into my mindthat I could do to get the money for them to save Lovelace Peyton'seyes and not hurt the family pride. There is no doubt about it, when agirl gets so she can ask God to help her and think at the same time,she can find an inspiration when she needs it. I may be in trouble anddisgraced, but I've got Him on my side, and I can yet do things whenmy friends have such dire needs as a doctor. I am afraid to write iteven to you, leather Louise.Suddenly I stood up beside Mr. Douglass, and looked down at Roxanne,and then up at him."Do both of you trust me enough to let me try to help if I do it withmy own brains and not--not my father's money?" I asked.For a moment they both looked at me, and then the Idol took my hand inhis and looked me in the eyes just as square as I looked at him."Yes," he said in a voice that grows more wonderful the more you loveand know him, "you are one of us and you can plan with us all you areable to.""Yes, Phyllis; you have never offered or asked us to do anything weought not to, and if you can think with us I know it will help,"Roxanne said, looking up at me trustfully.Again I make record, Louise, that my course with the Byrd family pridehas conquered it, even if I did display symptoms of it myself bystaying away from the cottage so long. I'm in a very queer position. Ihave not made everybody understand that I can't be a Girl Scout and Iam a dishonored person in Byrdsville, with all sorts of distinctionsoffered me. But this scheme I have thought up to get the doctor herehas made me hold my breath so that I can hardly write, and I can'tworry over honors and medals and things. I will do it! I will!Good-night!CHAPTER XSome people are so afflicted with energy that their days aretwenty-five and a half hours long. Mine are twenty-six just now. If itwere not for the fact that several hours each day I am under theinfluence of Roxanne's repose, I suspect I would run down like a clockthat has exhausted its mainspring. Mamie Sue says that Belle saysRoxanne is shiftless, but Belle is unable to distinguish shiftlessnessfrom noble composure under difficulties. I told Mamie Sue that itwould be best for her to forget all that Belle has ever said to her;and she is trying.Still, though I understand it perfectly, it is positively queer tohear Roxanne talk about what the great doctor is going to do forLovelace Peyton's eyes, and they haven't done one thing about gettinghim here from Cincinnati. The Idol has gone back to the obscurity ofthe shed, and I suppose he is making up some plan about the doctor,while he is working with his furnaces and retorts and things, but hehasn't told one yet, and it is two whole days. I do hope and pray thatmy plan will succeed without his having to bother with a common thinglike money.I have had to go to school these two days and then I have to studymedicine with Lovelace Peyton almost all of every afternoon, so Ihaven't much time; but I think by to-morrow night I will have toldabout a thousand dollars' worth of things about my father and I cansend it all off to Cousin Gilmore Lewis. The time the butler in ourNorth Shore cottage, summer before last, told the newspapers so manythings about the way Father and his family lived, he got three hundreddollars for it; so it does seem that if his own daughter told almost awhole small book about Father it would be worth at least a thousanddollars to a big magazine that prints things about everything in theworld.I heard Cousin Gilmore tell Father last spring that it wouldn't belong before he got to him in his magazine, and I have two reasons forwanting to beat the one who is going to write Father up. One is that Ineed the money for Lovelace Peyton's eyes, and the other is thatbefore all this comes out about Father and the stolen steel patent, Iwant to write about him like he might be, and ignore what the worldmay consider him. I want to tell about him like I feel toward him andnot like I know people will think he is. If the weekly comes out everyweek, they ought to print what I say about a week from Saturday, andmaybe it will take Judge Luttrell that long to get his prosecutionready. The Judge doesn't work much harder than others in Byrdsville,and I can trust him to be slow. Of course, I couldn't write a thousanddollars' worth of things about just Father himself, but I am tellingall about Byrdsville, which is his present home, and how distinguishedand beloved he is in it.A lot I have written I have just copied down from you, Louise--who area better friend than I knew when I bought you--such as thedescriptions of the apple-trees and landscape and Father's charity toMr. and Mrs. Satterwhite. It filled up two pages just to mention thethings he gave them, and it was a page more when I told a few of thegrateful things they said to me. I left myself out and had them saythe things right to him. What his generosity in the matter of buyingjewelry from Mr. Snider did for the seven children--with just three ofthe names mentioned, because I think Sally Geraldine, Judy Claudia,and Tom Roderick are interesting as names--made more than a page more.I wrote until nearly twelve o'clock last night about the Byrds andtheir family history and how wonderful it is for Father to have madesuch friends as they are. I just described the Idol as he really isand told what a great inventor he is without dwelling on what heinvented, because that will be published when Judge Luttrell gets outthe injunction.I mentioned Lovelace Peyton's accident in detail, because some daywhen he is a world-famous surgeon a good account of it will bevaluable. That took up fourteen pages. I am going to send that kodakpicture Tony took of Roxanne, with a good description of her to beprinted under it.Nobody could really give a good history of the Byrd cottage without atleast a half dozen pages of Uncle Pompey and what he cooks. I am goingto get the nutcake recipe and paste it on the margin. All womenreaders will like that if they try it once.And just as I was so tired that I was about to fall into the ink-wellit occurred to me to describe faithfully the great-grandmother Byrdportrait, especially about her being such a friend of GeorgeWashington's wife and about the English earl who fell in love withher, but grandfather Byrd was the victor to carry off the prize. Itgave Father credit just to have bought the house they lived in.I got up early this morning and wrote about what good friends he hasmade of Judge Luttrell and Mr. Chadwell, and some of the othergentlemen. I told what a great lawyer the Judge is and I herementioned Tony's Scout medal, too, for if a Scout medal is notdistinguished, I don't know what is.And writing about Tony's medal reminded me that I would have to writesomething about myself, or seem to be prudish. I left that untilto-night, and I have just finished it. I had to get in two pages aboutMiss Priscilla and the Colonel before I began on myself. I defendedher for not marrying him unless she wants to, and I moralized fivesentences on a woman's right not to marry.Then I thought that when it is published all over the United States,Mamie Sue might accidentally see a copy and be hurt that she was notin it, so I put her recipe for fudge in with her name signed to it. Igrouped Pink and Sam and the two Willises and some others as prominentcitizens who were all Father's friends, with just slight mention oftheir being his guest on the hay-ride. I left Belle and Helena and thePetway silk-tie-boy out. I thought it was kindness.Then when I got to myself I hadn't a word to say because I had usedall the words in the dictionary several times over about the others,so I just wrote this that I copy down in order to see again how itlooks: "Mr. Forsythe has one child, Phyllis. She is a tall, stronggirl with tan hair, and she shares his friendship for Byrdsvilleenthusiastically." Now, if that isn't the truth, I don't know what is,and what more could I say about myself? That is a very dignified andcorrect account of me.I have only to write the note to Cousin Gilmore to tell him that athousand dollars is the price and not to let it come out later thannext Saturday, and tie it up in a box for the express. As I say, Ithink just lately I have worked more than twenty-four hours a day.Good-night!*       *       *       *       *I am glad that article for the weekly was finished yesterday, andexpressed, for if I hadn't finished it, I might have had to wait sometime. I must study hard now, for examinations begin next week, and Iam so far behind that it is difficult for me to even understand whatthey are talking about in class, and I have been able to recite purelyby accident. It is one of the strange and unaccountable things thathappen in a person's life that hard study or the lack of it has noreal influence on the way a girl or boy recites. If I am well preparedon a lesson, the teacher always asks me something that had slipped mymost diligent hunt, and if I don't know a thing about the lesson sheasks me a question about something I do know about. Such is schoollife!And it is a fortunate thing for me that next week is examination, foreverybody is too worried and busy to notice me and my affairs, andthey don't talk Scouts or parties or anything that I might beembarrassed about on account of my position. Quadratics areembarrassing to everybody. I have to study. Good-night.*       *       *       *       *I did the Idol a dreadful injustice when I felt that he had gone towork on another of his inventions and had not made a plan for LovelacePeyton's eyes. I didn't write down that I had felt hard toward him,for that would have seemed disloyal, but I did. He wrote right up tothe doctor in Cincinnati and asked him to come on the next train andthe heartless man telegraphed that it would cost a thousand dollarsfor him to come and it would have to be guaranteed. No wonder the Idolwas white and still for a whole day. Now he has thought up a plan andit is a sacrifice, but he and Roxanne are going to do it, if I can'tget the thousand by telegram, as I asked Cousin Gilmore to send it byMonday morning--which they don't know about yet. I hate to write thesacrifice down--it seems a desecration! They are going to sell one ofthe foundation stones of the Byrd family pride for this vulgar moneythey need for the doctor from Cincinnati. I can't bear to think aboutit, though I have never seen the ancestral stone, and it is only a fewmusty papers, kept in the vault at the Byrdsville County Bank. Theyare letters from George Washington and other generals to one of theByrd ancestors, written during the Revolution about some of the greatstratagems they wanted him to execute for them with his regiment,which was a very fine one. They hope that they're worth much more thanany thousand dollars, and they are to be the price of LovelacePeyton's eyes. The Idol has written about them and he hopes to get themoney immediately by telegraph, and send for the doctor the first ofnext week. That is, if God doesn't let me get my telegram beforetheirs. He is going to, my faith makes me believe.And Oh! I do want my composition to be printed so the world may knowwhat a good man my father could be, if he would just give up histhirst for money. It may keep other young men from following in hisfootsteps, instead of doing like Judge Luttrell and other Byrdsvillemen."Of course, Phyllis, it is an awful thing to give up a part of yourinheritance like those papers are, but then Lovey's eyes are stillmore valuable to the Byrd family," Roxanne said, as we were discussingthe sacrifice. "He is going to be such a great doctor that he willmake history himself and, of course, we will have copies of theoriginals; and when people are writing Douglass's and Lovey'sbiographies they can go and see the originals. And after theeye-doctor is paid, we will have a lot left over for this new thingDouglass is inventing. He just told me about it last night, and I cantell you now.""Don't tell me, Roxanne, don't!" I interrupted her quickly. The blooddyed my face so red that I felt as if I could wipe it off with myhandkerchief, if I tried.And Roxanne, instead of blushing, got pale and put her arm around myneck. Real love always has the right thing to say at the right time."Phyllis," she whispered in a tickling fashion right against my ear,"when Douglass told me about it last night he came back in my room tosay, 'Don't tell a single soul but Phyllis.'"If some accident should happen to make me famous, I wish the personthat writes my biography could put down how I felt when Roxannewhispered that to me. I choked a little bit and Roxanne hugged thechoke and was just beginning to tell me about the experiment whenLovelace Peyton called us to come to him.He is dreadfully spoiled since he has had to keep so still all thetime, but we try to do just as he says. He lies there in bed andthinks up all the impossible things that might be done and then asksus to do them. He longed so for "squirms" that Tony got a wooden boxand made little divisions and brings him in a lot of new ones almostevery day. They fill Roxanne's days and nights with terror. And it isupsetting to see the fishing-worms in the dirt, while the hop-toadstays out on the bed a good deal of the time; but we have to stand itand smile at it in our voices while talking to him, even if we haveterror in our faces. Yesterday Uncle Pompey spent most of his timecatching the chickens and bringing them in for him to feel, andLovelace Peyton has a box of straw on a chair by the bed, with a hentied in it, setting on a dozen eggs.But a thing that stops my breath with pain is, that I am fraid thatLovelace Peyton is beginning to think about being blind, and my throataches while I write what happened when Roxanne left him with me afterhe had called us."Do you want me to read the medicine book, now, Lovelace Peyton? Mumpscomes next," I said, as I sat down by the head of the bed, nearer thanI liked to the setting hen."No, Phyllie," he answered in a queer, unlifelike way. "Please findblind eyes and read all about them to me.""Oh, they are not interesting," I said, and the lump rose so I couldhardly breathe. "Let me read measles, if you don't think you will likemumps. Do you remember that experiment about cutting away a piece ofthe heart itself that the man tried? Let me read that again." I waspleading with him so that my voice began to tremble."Please let me put my hand on your face, Phyllie, so if I kin git youto tell the truth to me, I kin feel if you cry," he said as he reachedup and put one little hand that is getting white and weak against mycheek. I forced my eyes to drink up the tears that they had let get asfar as my lashes, and put my arm under his head and cuddled himagainst my shoulder, my shoulder that has had to learn to cuddle sincehe got hurt."Is I going to be blind, Phyllie, and kin they be a blind doctor, if Iam?" he asked, with his baby mouth set with the Byrd familyexpression, the first time I had ever seen it on his face."Oh, no, Lovelace Peyton, No!" I exclaimed, hugging him up closer. "Agreat big doctor is coming on the cars in just a few days to make youwell.""But _kin_ a doctor be a blind man, Phyllie," he asked again, withhis mouth still set."Yes, Lovelace Peyton, if you are the blind man," I answered aspositively as I felt. It is true for if he is blind, then there willbe a blind doctor in the world and a famous one at that."Will you always go with me to tell me how the folks and sores andblood and things look, Phyllie, so I kin give the right medicine?" heasked, curling his fingers around mine in a still tighter grasp."Yes, I will, indeed I will," I answered, with words that pushed theirway from my heart.And just then Tony came in with Pink, in such a dejected manner that Ihardly knew them. I knew from their looks and my own feelings that itwas the quadratics we were going to have on examination Tuesday, andmy deepest sympathy went out to them."Say, Dr. Snakes," said Tony solemnly, as he sat down almost upon thetoad on the bed by Lovey, "I've brought Pink, the Rosebud, to beoperated on at my expense entirely. I have been trying to put algebrainto his head for a solid hour, and now I want it split open so I canjust chuck the book in whole to save my time. Shall I go get the axe?"And Lovelace Peyton laughed just as much at Tony as the rest of usdid, though the hen got frightened and began to squawk so that bothTony and Pink had to work to tie her down tighter. They didn't need meright then, so I slipped out and went home through the garden.Oh, that doctor must come down here quick to see about those valuableeyes! I don't dare think what I will do if the article about Fatherfails, but I feel sure it won't. Still my heart beats as if itcouldn't get all the blood it needs--and that reminds me thatphysiology comes on Wednesday. I ought to study, but I can't.And another thing that is worrying me is, that I didn't go to see whatMrs. Satterwhite wanted when she sent for me, and it might be that Icould have spent some money if I had found out what she would like tohave. I have been so busy and so scared that I haven't been down tothe Public Square this week, and now I will have to go and shop allmorning if I am to keep up the amount of the monthly bills.I wonder if Miss Priscilla would let me express my admiration for herby buying her one of those lovely boxes of paper with gold letters oneach piece. I don't know anybody else in Byrdsville that they seem tomatch, and they cost five dollars, which the postmaster needs badlyfrom the looks of his fringed cuffs and collars. Accepting a presentis bestowing affectionate regard on the person that offers it, and Ibelieve Miss Prissy feels that way about me. She must feel in herheart that I do not blame her course of conduct to the Colonel likethe rest of Byrdsville does. I am more charitable to faults thanothers. I have to be. I believe I will risk the box of paper.But on the other hand, I am very fond of the Colonel and I feel that Iwould like him to know that I think he is very noble not to desertMiss Priscilla, even if she doesn't want to marry him. He is afaithful friend. I wonder if he would like that lovely long-stemmedpipe that is in the drug store? And I feel like I ought to do it, notto be partial. I won't buy him tobacco, for I feel sure that is athing that women ought to fear to do for a man.This is a very lonely night, and I can't write any more because itreminds me to be uneasy about the express package in which I sent thearticle to Gilmore's Weekly.I am going down to sit in my mother's room in a dark corner to becomforted. That is my right and hers, too. I wonder if girls that havemothers that can be real mothers, tell them all their troubles andperplexities and anxieties, or do girls that have mothers not have theother things to tell them?But one thing before I close the ink-well I must record to my ownsatisfaction, though it seems mean to write it down. The Idol has noidea of paying any kind of attentions to Helena Kirby and it is allsettled that he doesn't like her; or, rather, doesn't know she isliving on the earth, which is still better. His lovely new gray suitdidn't affect him at all in regard to her. Roxanne told me all aboutit several days ago.Of course, everybody in Byrdsville has been very much interested andsorry over Lovelace Peyton's explosion and his eyes, and they have allcome and said so, and they hardly ever come empty-handed. Roxanne hasgot nice and plump eating the things, and so has Uncle Pompey, aftertheir long cornmeal fast during the time of invention number one.But Belle's mother, Mrs. Kirby, and Helena hadn't come or done asingle thing, until this occurred day before yesterday. Helenahappened of her own accord to meet the Idol right at the cottage gatewhen he came home from the furnace, and she was most untastefullybeautifully dressed. She had a large pink rose in her hand like a girlin a story-book. She stopped to smile on him with extreme favor andgive him the rose, also out of a book. Roxanne saw and heard it all,because she couldn't help it, from the window."Thank you, Miss Helena," he said with a grand bow. "I know Lovey willfeel complimented at your thinking about him, and the rose will belovely for him to smell and feel. He is better to-day, we hope--atleast not so nervous."Roxanne says Helena's expression was of one completely surprised, andshe went on down the street without any more use of the smile or thered silk and lace dress. If a man is at all interested in a girl, hewould be sure to get more pleasure and conversation than that out of arose, I feel sure. Oh, a genius has to be guarded from so many things!This is unkindness I've written, but I'm so nervous to-night over thethousand dollars that might not come for the article that I cannotcontrol my pen. Good-night again, Louise.CHAPTER XIThis is Saturday night, or Sunday morning, I am not sure which, as Ihave let my clock and watch both run down, for I have not had time towind them; but however late it is, I am going to write about all thisremarkableness, to you, leather Louise, so I will never forget how itall really happened. And writing it may make me believe it is true,though now it all _will_ seem a dream.I got up early on account of the quadratics and had a contest, thatlasted until ten o'clock, between them and a very overburdened mind. Iconquered, but at what cost!But still, from the fight, one of the gratifications of my life cameto me in the shape of the chance to help Belle. Mamie Sue has given upthe study of algebra forever, and is going to take botany instead, butBelle is still having dreadful struggles. Mamie Sue told me aboutBelle having a wet towel around her head all night and other reallytragic things that made me lose all my hurt at her and filled me withextreme sympathy. I was over at Roxanne's on my way to read diphtheriato Lovelace Peyton, and just as Mamie Sue was describing how the poorgirl had to put her feet in hot water to take the chill off of them,down the street came Belle looking all that Mamie Sue had said of her.My heart was so wrung that I spoke before I had time to let her mannerdaunt me."Oh, Belle," I said, with hasty enthusiasm, "I worked a lot thismorning and I can solve them all now in the easiest way. Let me showyou.""I--I wish you would, Phyllis, and thank you," she answered in a meekvoice that was not hers at all. It had a nice, mournful, friendly toneto it that I wish it could keep even when the cause for sorrow isremoved, which I succeeded in doing in about another hour of hardmanual labor, if you call pounding manual labor. It is!Roxanne sat down beside us, and we sent Mamie Sue in to keep LovelacePeyton quiet with her company; only to use the fudge from her pocketin case she couldn't succeed. We found them both later with chocolatesmeared on their faces; but Lovelace Peyton likes Mamie Sue, for hereasy nature is most lovable."Thank you, Phyllis," said Belle, when we had figured the last formulaas simply as I had found out how to do it. "I have always thought thatyou are as smart as anybody in the class, and I now think--"I wish Belle had had time to finish that sentence, for I don't believeshe will be in such a nice temper for a long time; but we wereinterrupted by Tony and the Colonel and Miss Priscilla coming past myhouse and into the cottage front gate. The Colonel was dressed up inhis white vest and Sunday hat, and Miss Priscilla was flying moreribbons and ruffles than usual, while I never saw Tony's grin quite sobroad and his freckles shone out more than ever, as they always dowhen he is excited."Miss Phyllis," said the Colonel, in his grand manner that everybodyin Byrdsville tries to copy when there is anything important to besaid, especially in public, like the mayor does in his speeches, "Ihave come to announce to you that this morning's mail has brought agreat honor to you, and through you, to Byrdsville. Allow me to handyou this medal that is given you for the heroic feat of life-saving bythe Girl Scouts of America, called, I believe, the Organization of theCampfire. I wrote on to inform the authorities of the deed of thePatrol Leader of the Palefaces, as your Girl Scout band is named, andthis letter, with the accompanying medal, is the result. I aminformally showing you the medal now, but the letter will be read andthe medal presented at the commencement exercises of the ByrdAcademy." And with a low bow that crinkled the stiff white vest, theColonel handed me the medal.I was paralyzed--real paralysis of both mind and body, especially legsand tongue--and I believe I would have been sitting there on the frontsteps of the cottage yet, in a dumb and stupid manner, with them alllooking at me, if Tony Luttrell who, as I have remarked before, is avery understanding person, though a boy, hadn't flared his eyes andmewed under his breath. Then we all laughed so loud that it broughtMamie Sue to the door though Lovelace Peyton called so loudly thatRoxanne had to run to him; and so did Mamie Sue, with the treacherouschocolate smears on her mouth, after having promised not to give it tohim unless she just had to."Phyllis, if Tony says Kitten Patrol to you one single time more,something will have to be done to him that is serious," said MissPriscilla, frowning at Tony with a frown that only seemed to bring outthe dimple in her left cheek. "Now congratulate her nicely, Tony!"[Illustration: The Colonel handed me the medal]"Madam," said Tony, straightening up and looking so much like theColonel that it was funny (but of course Tony has learnedimpersonation), "accept my heartfelt congratulations for thusachieving a triumph of kittenism. Will that do, Miss Prissy Bubble?"And again we all laughed, the Colonel the most of all, and even Bellea little, too."Phyllis, you are one perfectly good brick," Tony said suddenly,dropping the teasing of Miss Priscilla from his voice; and he lookedat me with just as affectionate an expression in his squinty eyes aswhen he looks at Pink Chadwell. It is a great thing for a girl to feelthat a fine boy likes her as much as he does his most chosen boycomrade. I felt that keenly."Thanks, everybody," I managed to say in an awkward way that mortifiedme into being unable to patch it up with any kind of brilliant remarkfollowing.One of the things that had struck me so dumb was that I thought I hadrefused to be the Girl Scout Leader because of my disgrace, and nobodyhad paid any attention to my refusal. Thus it is, a person cannotescape either fame or disgrace because other people take more interestin both than you do yourself, and do not let you forget."And now that the Colonel has made you his speech, Phyllis," said MissPriscilla, "I want you to come down to the Presbyterian Church parlorswith me to a joint meeting of our Relief Society with the MethodistRelief. They want to make you an honorary member of both on account ofthe way you have dealt with the Satterwhites, who have for years beenone of the greatest troubles to all of us. Of course this is not amedal, but it is an expression of hearty esteem, and I hope they willget the meeting over nicely without any discussion or argument comingup from either side on the charity question."By that time I was so numb from having shocks that I let her and theColonel lead me down the street, while Tony went in to keep LovelacePeyton from fretting for the diphtheria lesson until I could comeback.Mrs. Luttrell made me the Methodist speech and Mrs. Willis thePresbyterian one, and they said so much that I felt sure they wereglad that I was only expected to say "Thank you!" and then sit downwhile they all offered different resolutions about different thingsthat were never exactly decided but voted on, nevertheless.When we came out of the church, I told Miss Priscilla about the box ofpaper in such a determined tone of voice that she didn't refuse it atall, and went with me to buy the pipe for the Colonel, which I knowwill make it very valuable to him when I tell him who helped selectit. It is a very interesting thing to be neighbor and friend to amysterious love affair that is one of the traditions of Byrdsville. Ibelieve I have solved the why of the failure of their marriage to comeoff, but until I am certain I won't even write it to you, Louise.On my way home, I am glad to record, I took time to do a littleshopping. I bought some buckets we didn't need from one of thelittlest shops in town, some more groceries for the Satterwhites, abolt of gingham to make Sallie Geraldine and Judy Claudia some aprons,then hurried back on the wings of anxiety to the bedside of LovelacePeyton, to get the diphtheria started. As I ran I could just feel himthrashing around in the bed and persecuting Roxanne and Mamie Sue, ifshe had not already escaped for her life.But as fast as I tried to go, I met an interruption on the way upProvidence Road, that was agreeable although detaining from duty. Tonyand Pink and Sam stopped me and told me that they were just on theirway to bring me to the Crotch, and that I would be the first strangeperson that had ever seen it, since they had fixed it up in theLuttrell barn loft to have Scout meetings in. Mr. Douglass had plannedand helped them with it, and they said there never was such a place ofinterest in Byrdsville. The reason they were going to show me was thatI must get the empty room over the garage Father has turned the oldfamily stable of the Byrds into, to make a wigwam for the PalefacePatrol to have meetings and keep things in. They had asked Mamie Sueto go with me because it would take two girls to remember all theysaw, and that would be the last time we could come there, though theywould come often to the Wigwam if we wanted them to show us how to beas scouty as possible.Just then Mamie Sue came up, and she either snorted with indignationor choked with candy, I cannot tell which; but because we had to, weaccepted their kind invitation with gratitude. We stopped at the housefirst and told Mrs. Luttrell we were going to the barn with the boys,and she said not to get hurt or fall, and gave us a tea-cake allaround. Mamie Sue held the plate and happened to get two, not at allby intention, for they were stuck together.Tony swung up from the horse trough to the loft by a pole, while Samand Pink stayed to push us up. I went up just as easily as Tony did,before they had time to push me one inch, but poor Mamie Sue stuckhalfway through the trap-door and we thought we would never be able toget her either up or down without calling out the fire-company, as Samsuggested; but she kept astonishingly cool herself and wiggled in justthe way Tony told her to, and at last got up. She said she knew thatshe could fall down all right, when the time came to go, so for us notto worry about that, and we proceeded to enjoy the Crotch.I never dreamed boys could get together so many remarkable things andmake it so interesting to tell about them. The big kettle to boilwater and the poles and the sticks and the blankets and tin cups andplates were in one corner and a shelf held the knapsacks with the"first aid" things in the opposite corner. All of Sam's bird-eggs, thecollection of which he had seen the error of, and had to give up whenhe became a Scout, was on a table by the window, and his butterflieswere pinned on large pieces of brown paper on the wall and looked likea beautiful decoration.And while we looked at the things it had taken the boys so long tocollect, I rejoiced that I could manage to spend a lot of money to fixup the Wigwam, and told them about each thing that I could buy, as Ithought it up, from seeing something that they had."Say, Bubble, is the long pole for exercise going to be braced so theDumpling can go over without danger?" said Tony, in the teasing voicehe uses to girls, that doesn't make them mad."I think we ought to have every single thing that girls can use tomake them as strong as boys," I answered. "When girls are strongenough not to be any burden, the boys will take them everywhere theygo and everybody will have just twice as much fun.""I suppose you would like to make the boys learn to do tatting andsewing to let them in on that sort of kitten gatherings," said Sam,with a laugh that was not so nice as Tony's."We would, if it wasn't for the fact that Petway does the knitting actso well that he is a perfect lady. We never could equal him," answeredTony, with jolly good humor to save our feelings from being hurt bySam."Well, I don't believe it will hurt--" I was just going to say, whenwe heard Uncle Pompey, calling down in the barn for me to please comequick before Lovelace Peyton killed them all dead.We all slid down, including Mamie Sue, with astonishing grace, and Ipromised to begin to fix the Wigwam next week. I promised, but a painhit my heart. Did I know that I would be in Byrdsville next week orever again? What would Father do when that prosecution found him? Forten days I had not been letting myself think about the future, but itseems that every minute I live in Byrdsville, my heart winds around myfriends and theirs around mine. To take me away now would be to tearme--but where was Father, and why didn't I hear what he is going to doand have done to him?As I once more hurried down the street to the diphtheria lesson, itseemed to me that Byrdsville broke on me all suddenly as a lovely andmaybe to-be-lost vision. All the leaves have come out on the trees andvines now, and everybody's yard is in bloom and is full of sweetodors. Doors and windows stand wide open and people sit on their frontporches and visit back and forth like every evening was a great bigparty. And amid it all I have felt like I belonged to something forthe first time in my life.Then suddenly it came true that now I do belong. This is how ithappened! Just as I had got to Lovelace Peyton and soothed him by afew lines of the symptoms of fever and nausea and headache that comefirst in diphtheria, Roxanne stood at the door with a telegram in herhand for me, and my heart stopped beating while it took leaps all overmy body, about fifty to the second. I promised Lovelace Peyton a halfdozen rolls of antiseptic bandages and a paper of sticking-plaster anda June-bug, if I could find one, to let me into the living-hall toread it. I felt that if it said, "No," about the secret article Icouldn't trust myself not to let him know that something was thematter.It didn't say "No!" Wait, I'll copy it, Louise!    A payment of one thousand dollars for articles from you will    be in Byrdsville on Saturday. Letter follows.    COUSIN GILMORE.My knees shook under me, and my eyes couldn't take in the letterswell, but I asked Roxanne, who was standing waiting to hear what thetelegram could be about, just as a friend should feel over a telegram,to run out to the shed and get our Idol quick, and I would tell themall about it together. He came in looking perfectly beautiful with hiscoat off and a big apron on him. His eyes were just as excited as minefelt, now that the mist had cleared, and it seemed to me even in thatmoment that no other thousand dollars in the world could have broughtso much suspense and excitement as this one had.But I knew that I might have a battle to fight in which I must win,and I steadied my nerves and made myself feel like Father looks whenhe reads important letters and begins to dictate answers in telegrams."Mr. Douglass Byrd," I said, perfectly coolly over my own inwardvolcano, "you remember you promised me that if I could use my ownbrains on a plan to get the doctor here for Lovelace Peyton's eyes,you would let me do it?""Yes, I said just about that," he answered me, and he looked in myeyes in a depending way that was so like Lovelace Peyton used to dothat again the mist came over my eyes. I am getting to have thatproper mist now instead of the choke, and I am glad, because it can behid better than a choke."Well, I found the plan and worked it for us, and I will have thethousand dollars by night-time, and we can get the doctor fromCincinnati by to-morrow, and have it all over before the algebraexamination on Monday," I answered.Then, in very many less words than I have used to tell about it toyou, Louise, I told him what I had done, with Roxanne standing withher arm across my shoulders, that trembled with excitement. To cap offthe climax of the story in proper fashion, as we are taught in therhetoric to do, I handed him the telegram--and I felt like the Colonellooks when I did it. He stood for what seemed hours, with the telegramin his hand, and something makes me suspect that he was having thesame hard time as I was having with a choke, only this was the firsttime and it came very near resulting in weeping, which I had neverdone up to that time."It is a wonderful thing for you to have done, dear," he said at last,with a look that got down to the core of my inexperienced heart andmade it thump uncomfortably. "And if there were no other way to getthe doctor for the kiddy's eyes I would accept this loan gladly, but Ihave heard in the morning mail, that I can sell the Washington lettersand I am going immediately to arrange about it that way. You know,though, how great it was of you to do this, and how it makes us alllove you. We don't have to tell--"But here he was interrupted by an avalanche of words that must havebeen dammed up in me for all the fifteen years of my life for thatspecial occasion, and I delivered them with an eloquence that musthave equaled that famous valedictory of Colonel Stockell's at the ByrdAcademy, the year he left for the war. I told him just what a lonelylife had been broken into by the sunshine of Roxanne's and LovelacePeyton's and his family affection for me, and now they were just thecore of my heart, which he was wounding. I described in detail how Ihad suffered when Roxanne and Lovelace Peyton had been hungry, and hadbeen brought to the dishonesty of feeding him in private, with never aword of my suffering to hurt that Byrd family pride that they areturning as a weapon on me. I even mentioned the patches on histrousers and the break in Roxanne's shoes that had been patches andrents in my own heart. I tried to make them see how hard it had beenwhen I have been commanded to buy things for people that I didn't careabout hardly at all, except as fellow-beings, when I was hungry togive what was needed to my most beloved. By this time I had got to thepoint of exaltation, and Roxanne had hid her head on my shoulder,while that Idol's eyes were so wide with astonishment that I thoughthe would never be able to get them to normal size again. "And afterLovelace Peyton has hurt himself in my cause, as he did from hearingthat I wanted an explosion," I still ruthlessly continued, "you wantto deny me the happiness of getting his eyes saved by my own unaidedefforts. When I was disgraced and humiliated, I put that kind of prideI had aside and came to you when you called me because you needed me,trusting in your friendship for me and love of me, but now that thetime has come for you to yield just a little bit of your pride, youwon't do it for me."Here I paused, and a thought of explanation for their cruelty cameover me. "Because I am my father's daughter, do you think this money Ihave made is tainted, too? And is that the reason why you don't wantto use it?""Oh, Phyllis!" Roxanne gasped under my chin, and the Idol got as whiteas a sheet and his eyes looked like I had struck him a blow."You can't get the money from the telegraph office and give it to mequick enough, kiddie," he said, with the choke coming out clear in hisvoice. "Forgive me! The youngster's eyes will be twice the value savedin such a way," and he took my hand and held it in both of his againsthis heart, in a manner to make me feel that never again would I haveto struggle with that Byrd pride."Please forgive me for fighting you like that," I said with a horribleblush of memory coming over me as I thought of all I had said, aboutthe patches on the trousers especially. "You made me do it and--"But here we were interrupted as an apparition stood in the door andregarded the sad and joyful tableau we made with its head on one side,right corner of the mouth up, and left eyelid drooped. It was Father,and I had never seen him look so grand or with such a noble expressionon his face! And as he stood still and looked at us, I held my breathfar longer than it is safe to do. And as Father looked, the Idol drewhimself up and his head took on the pose of the feminine Byrdportrait, but he still held my hand in both of his as he looked Fathersteadily in the face. I was scared and so was Roxanne as we huggedeach other as women always do from fright.Then, without a word, Father walked right up under the portrait andtook the Idol by both shoulders and gave him one good shake thattottered us all."You young idiot, you! You young idiot!" he said in a tone of suchaffection that it was unbelievable to my ears. And as I heard it, Iknew that all my trials and disgraces and puzzlings were over, and Iturned my head upon Roxanne's back hair and wept tears, the first timein my life--and I hope not the last.CHAPTER XII"Now, see here, Phil, don't give out on the situation like that," saidFather, as he slapped me on the back to still the tears while Roxannehugged me and the Idol still held my hand."Please go on and tell what you did or didn't do to the 'secret,'" Isobbed, but I stood on my own feet again and was using both my naturalhands to wipe my eyes.The Idol had been for minutes standing and looking at Father like achild that has just awakened and doesn't know whether the awful thingthat was pursuing him was a dream or a real bear. Roxanne was thefirst one to speak, and as usual she had seen the rosy side ofsomething, even if it was not the real thing."You didn't really steal the secret at all, did you, Mr. Forsythe?"she asked, with her lovely and engaging enthusiasm. "I just knew it,all the time.""Yes, I did 'steal the secret'--if that is the way you put it--_protem_, which means 'for the time being.' You are a nest of veryyoung idiots, and I trusted to that; but you opened your puppy eyes atthe time I hadn't counted on, with the help of Luttrell's scoutingnose." He paused, as if not right sure that he was going to tell abouteverything, and as he looked at us we did look like a basket of littlesilly puppies with mouths and eyes wide open--the Idol most of all."And now first, young man," said Father, turning to Mr. Douglass, lefteyelid drooping lower than usual, "I just want to say to you what Ithink of you for leaving not only all the traces of such a valuablediscovery unprotected in a shed, but leaving your notebook anddrawings, too. Any other man but a Byrd of Byrdsville, would not havetrusted the book off his person a half minute, and would havedestroyed the traces of each experiment the minute it was done. Thosesteel shavings were the most idiotic-looking things I ever saw, andwhen I emptied the box it was with a groan at your foolishness. Justthe looks of 'em kept me from trusting you with my intentions. Icouldn't afford to run the risk of your carelessness, so I took thewhole thing and decamped with it.""Oh, Father!" I gasped, beginning to get the untrustful feeling again."Hush, Phyllis," said the Idol, looking at Father like he was Jack,the Giant-Killer, and just about as much interested as if it was nothis own tremendous fortune Father was telling about taking off withhim."I had been down in the garden to the garage to give the new car alooking over, and I saw Rogers go into that shed and knew, from havingbeen told by Phyllis accidentally of the steel experiments, what washappening. I followed him a little later, and saw your trustfullayout, exposed to the world as is the human nature of all Byrdsville.Rogers is an expert and would run through your notebook and get thewhole thing in a few seconds. I knew that he would watch his time, tryout the experiments at the furnace, and get the patent while you weredeliberating about proceeding in a Chesterfieldian manner with aninjunction drawn slowly and literarily by your friend, Judge Luttrell.Rogers was fully equipped by his association with me to do youand--quick. I took no such chances as having you and the Judge'sByrdsvillianism mixed up in the affair. I stole your secret that hadbeen stolen, left for a Pennsylvania furnace the next morning, hadexperimental furnaces built, tried out the experiments before thecompany, keeping dust in Rogers's eyes by demanding to be in on hisrobbery, patented it by push-legislation in Washington, and am backwith an offer of fifty thousand dollars down and a royalty to bedecided upon in a ten-year contract. I have a great mind to put it intrust for you, idiotic dreamer that you are--and perhaps the mostnoted man in the field of commercial invention for this year at anyrate! How did you come to think out that process of a disturbance ofatomic arrangement at that temperature?""Why, you see, Mr. Forsythe, in the laboratory at Princeton, justbefore I left, I had begun some atomic experiments, and out at thefurnace it struck me all of a heap, what it would do if we could treatthe ore at some ascertained temperature in the way I have found. Now,in another case that I am working on, I may be able even to make theprocess--""Help!" said Father. "Let's get down to business on this propositionbefore we get to the other one."And we all laughed, for it was funny to see the Idol with patches onhis trousers and hardly a day's living ahead, pass right over thefifty thousand dollars, with more in the contract, and all thesensation it had made, to begin to explain about what was out in theshed now. He looked pained at our interruption and tried to beginagain, but Father interrupted him."Well, have you told this one to these 'bubbles,' as my young friendLuttrell so appropriately calls them? By the way, the economicalRogers had on the coat that Dr. Byrd had doctored for the cholera,which I had asked him to destroy for me, and the Scout Leader wasright in his nose clue. I suppose that was what led him to suspect meand shadow Rogers to the telegraph office. Great boy, that Luttrell!But to return to the girls: If you have told Phyllis, I shall have tokeep her in solitary confinement until it is finished. Miss Roxanne, Iknow, can be trusted at large."I knew Father was just joking, by the eyelid and the corner of hismouth, but the Idol drew himself up according to the old portraitagain before he spoke."Mr. Forsythe" he said, "I haven't any secret that Phyllis can't know.If she accidentally gave this one away to Rogers--she can the next,_and_ the next." He took my hand again and drew me close to him.To think that that wonderful Idol should feel like that aboutinsignificant me!And father looked as impressed as he ought to have been, and begged mypardon in the proper manner; only I saw the bat in his eyes thatshowed how amused he was."Well," he said slowly, "Phyllis is a dangerous person to tell secretsto, or even to live an ordinary life before. Her penetration is sokeen that she sees a man in his true character--and gets a thousanddollars from him for her estimate of his personality. I am glad to buythe opinion of me that you sent your cousin Gilmore at a thousanddollars, Phyllis,--it is worth more than that to me--from you!" Hiseyes were very tender to me though then, laughing: "Want to seeyourself as she sees you in this thousand-dollar book I'm going tohave printed, Byrd?" he asked teasingly."Oh, no!" I gasped; "I hoped he would never see that! Don't give himone, if you bought it. Don't even talk about it!" Let's go telegraphthe doctor--we have forgotten the eyes too long now.""That will not be necessary," said Father, with the lovely look thatcomes into his face when Lovelace Peyton is even mentioned. "When Iread your letter to Gilmore, I hunted around immediately and broughtthe best man in New York with me to see to those eyes. He is over atthe house getting rested and ready, and will have to make hisexamination in less than an hour now, so you two had better hustle toget Dr. Byrd ready for him. Everything must be antiseptic."Antiseptic, with those fishing worms and the hen and the pet toad andthe June bugs in his bed! Roxanne fled, calling Uncle Pompey on herway."Then my thousand dollars won't--won't be needed?" I asked with acontemptible feeling of disappointment that the Byrds had got so richbefore I had been able to do this one thing for them. I looked up atold Grandmother Byrd over the mantelpiece and said in my heart: "Youhave won."But what happened then? The Idol, with the comprehension which is oneof the symptoms of all genius, turned to me quickly and put his armacross my shoulder."Phyllis," he said, with his most wonderful eyes shining down intomine, "that check is going to the doctor just as soon as your Fathergives it to you. I told you that Lovey's eyes would be more valuableif saved by you--and--and I meant it."I didn't have to say anything, and I couldn't--he understood! I justclung!"Young idiots, both of you," said Father; but he blew his noseviolently, and I knew from experience how the lump in his throat felt."Now take me in to see Dr. Byrd.""Howdy," said Lovey, as Father shook hands with him and the toad atthe same time. "Did you get any more cholera? Did the medicine work?""Yes, the medicine worked--more ways than one," answered Father with apleased laugh. And he talked to Lovelace Peyton all the time about aman who got blown up in a mine that he saw in Pennsylvania, so that hemade no objections while Uncle Pompey took out all his "live stock."While the Idol and Roxanne and I did up the room, with his own handsFather bathed Lovelace Peyton and put on his clean, patched littlenight-clothes; and I saw one big tear, that came from the very bottomof the big man's heart, I know, splash on the biggest patch, as he wasguiding the little groping hands into the armhole.Then while I was buttoning Roxanne into a clean dress and the Idol wascarrying out the last mop, the doctor came in the front door. I was sodirty with the cleaning that I retired to the kitchen and helped theIdol into his collar and coat and to get his hands clean so he couldhurry on in to help. Uncle Pompey had got his usual violent spell ofasthma and I had just lighted his pipe for him when the Idol came backto the door of the kitchen."You'll have to come, Phyllis," he said, with a smile that took theanxiety off his face for an instant. "Lovey refuses to let the doctortouch him without you. Come quick! The doctor says the light isbeginning to go."I went, soiled dress and crying eyes and hair all rumpled and mussedwith the excitement."Phyllie," said Lovelace Peyton, who was sitting up in bed defyingthem all, "I ain't a-going to let that doctor touch me 'thout youstand right here and tell me how it all looks just as he does it.Don't leave out any bleed that comes, or any blue flesh or nerves ornothing. You know how, 'cause I have teached you. Neither Doug or Roxyain't no good with symptoms.""I will, Lovelace Peyton, I will," I answered; but I shuddered, forhow could I stand to see him tortured, as I felt he was going to be?[Illustration: "You stand right here and tell me how it all looks"]But I did--and it makes me weak to think about it now so that I shakeall over. As the instruments pried and pulled and injected the asepticsolutions I held his hand tight and talked as hard as I could. At theworst places I told the most awful lies about how horrible it lookedand placed all the frightful symptoms of every disease I had read tohim, right in his eyes. It sounded dreadful but I knew that itinterested him and helped in a way nothing else could."Go on, Phyllie, tell more," he would groan as I stopped forbreath--and on I would go piling inflammation on suppuration.Finally, after what seemed an age, the doctor drew a long sigh andlooked up at me with a kindly expression that I knew meant "saved."For a minute I reeled, and I do believe I would have learned whatfainting meant the same day I learned crying, if those little fingershadn't held on to me tight while the doctor gave just a whiff ofchloroform to ease the twitching nerves. He had been obliged to do theoperation without it, but risked just the whiff."Don't the chloroform smell good, Phyllie?" Lovelace Peyton whisperedup to me as he floated off and his hands relaxed."That was the most remarkable performance I ever participated in,"said the doctor out in the hall after he had finished telling us hownear the sight of both eyes had come to being destroyed from not beingkept drained. "And the two youngsters are the most remarkable I haveyet encountered. Miss Phyllis, let me congratulate you on a nerve anda talent for imaginative description the like of which I have nevermet before. But please somebody explain that boy to me before I catchthe train."I was glad Roxanne was the one to begin on the subject of LovelacePeyton, for only she had enough rosy words to describe him. She didbetter than I ever heard her before, and I could see how Father andthe doctor both enjoyed it."We will take him right away to college where he can learn to read andwrite for himself, in just a few months, and then to operate in somebig hospital before he comes down South to cure hookworm and pellagraand all the other things other doctors haven't found out about. Whatmedical college would you advise, Doctor?" she ended by asking, andher face was so lovely and enthusiastic that it looked almostinspired. There is no telling where Roxanne's dreams will land thefamily now that they will have the money to start on them."Well, Miss Byrd," answered the doctor in a tone of voice, that mademe know that he appreciated Roxanne at her true worth, "right now, forabout ten years, I would keep the small doctor in Byrdsville, mostlyout grubbing for experiments and 'squirms,' as he calls them. Thenwhen the time comes we shall see--we shall see.""Yes," answered Father, dropping his head with the corner of his mouthscrewed up. "Yes, we shall see!"And as he said it, somehow I felt that the Byrd family would never anymore be unlooked after, and that it was good to have such a man asFather for a father and a neighbor. And, Oh, I felt--I can't write it,I am so tired I will have to go to sleep with a "Thank God," as big ascan come from a heart the size mine is--which feels bigger to-nightthan it ever did before. Good-night, Louise of leather!*       *       *       *       *The quadratics were awful! I got ninety-five by a lot of it being luckthat I knew the questions, and Tony got eighty by the same process, hesays; but Belle and Pink just squeezed through by the skin of theirteeth. Sam didn't pass and neither did the tallest Willis. The otherone got seventy and the right to take another examination. Cruelty tochildren like that kind of examination ought to be stopped by law.And that is the reason I haven't written in this leather confidanteafter that Saturday, into which at least four years of my life werecrowded. By the calendar I am still just sixteen, but I am twenty byactual count.First--Father is a Raccoon in full standing, and is going to be ScoutMaster for a little troop just the minute Lovelace Peyton gets oldenough to organize one. And other honors have come to him like--but Imust put things down in an orderly fashion for Father as he has boughtyou on a book, Louise.Miss Priscilla is going to marry the Colonel. The secret of the why ofher not doing it before is out. I have always felt that Miss Priscillawas honorable and not cruel. The Colonel had never asked her before,and it seems that the Stockell pride is very like the Byrd pride. Helost his fortune during the war and she is rich. His honor forbade!But Father has got him to go on a board of directors of the CumberlandCoal and Iron Company. Father says to give tone to directors'meetings, but that reason is not to be mentioned. He gets a salary offifteen hundred dollars and is willing to marry on that, as MissPriscilla insists on it. He told me all about it and so did she.Tony, also, was in the confidence of both for these last few dayswhich was a great comfort, as he is always so full of plans toaccomplish things. In fact, it was Tony that made Miss Priscilla sendfor the Colonel with determination and it was I who got the salaryfixed with Father and urged the Colonel to respond to her summons.They are as happy as "Love's young dream continued into maturity." Iquote the Colonel exactly, as I think it is a literary gem.Being the best-man at the wedding is one of the honors that has cometo Father. I reminded him that the Colonel is not only a Stockell buthe is a Confederate hero. Father said that he appreciated all that andthat was what the salary was for."Bubble," said Tony, as he sat on the bench in our garden and fannedhimself with his hat, "now that you have got the old town geared upand jogging along smoothly with your almost boylike energy, let'sforget all about 'em and get ready a really humming Scout-Campfireceremonial for the second night of commencement. I have got onegruesome idea I will be ready to tell you about to-morrow. We needn'tlet in Roxy or the Dumpling or the other Kittens until it is allfixed, for they will be frozen with fear at the very idea of what willbe a Scout initiation, all right enough. But they'll do as you saywhen the time comes, for the whole bubble bunch, including Belle,since her algebra get-away, fall at any word you dope out to 'em fromnow on. Well done for you! You are not only a brick, Phyllis, but awhole wall of them that can be depended upon to line up to the mark."I wrote that down not to be conceited, but I want to preserve thatopinion of me in you, Louise, because it means that I have, in alittle way, deserved the happiness that has come to me.I came to this town a sad and lonely girl, with a great sorrow thathad kept me from being like other people and with a great distrust ofmy father, who had had to be both Father and Mother to me. I havefound friends and interests and excitement and adventure and sympathyand encouragement out here under that Old Harpeth Hill and I am alwaysgoing to keep them. I hope I never will go one step out of Byrdsvilleas long as I live, though Roxanne has planned trips to every corner ofthe world for us as soon as the Idol has finished this next invention.The Byrds have to stay in the cottage until Father can build anotherhouse for us to move into. Of course they will go back to Byrd Mansionand reign in it as they have always done. But I smile to myself thatone person got ahead of that stiff-necked old portrait--I did, andonce she even seemed to smile down on me.This was the time she seemed to do it. We had all been talking aboutthe plans for the new house down in the orchard, for Father and me,when Roxanne had to fly to Lovelace Peyton and Father tiptoed afterher just to peep at him a second. That left the Idol and me alone fora few minutes. How I would have shuddered at the mere thought of sucha thing happening to me a few months ago, but now it just seemedagreeable happiness. Through suffering I have grown bold, in myadoration of him."Let him build his old house, Phyllis," he said with first a glance upat the old Grandmother Byrd and then one at me that was as bashful asI began all suddenly to feel again, when he took my hand in his. "Hewon't--won't keep you--that is, not many years--will he?""Why,--what do you--" I began to ask him, when Father came back intothe room and I don't know to this day what the Idol meant to say, nordo I yet know what he meant by drawing himself up to his full Byrdpride height, while he looked Father straight in the eye, both of themalarmingly serious, until Father's eyes began to smile with whatseemed to be warm confidence. At which the Idol let go my hand andbegan to talk about steel. Oh, I am so glad, glad I am here to helpRoxanne to cherish such a genius as he is and that I know now for ourwhole lives no pride or anything cruel can come between him and me anymore! I can keep him perpetually safe on the pedestal of my love and Ifeel that it will be my right to help feed and patch him--only now hecan always buy new trousers.And for all time I have found Father!That night when I went in to commune with Mother like I do now moreand more, I found him in my chair in the corner but out of her sight,and he drew me down on his knee for the first time in all my life. Wesat quiet awhile and then he came into my room with me and we stood atthe window and looked out over the Harpeth Valley, where ProvidenceRoad lay like a silver ribbon as it wound its way over ProvidenceKnob. He had his arm around me, and as I have learned to do, I put myhead down on his shoulder."Phil," he said with such sadness in his voice that the new-learnedtears started, "this is all we will ever have of Bess. The doctor saysshe has begun to drift faster now, and it will not be long. What wouldI have done if I had lost even what she had been to me these sadyears--before I found you to help me?"Then, after the first time I had ever cried on my father's breast, hetold me all about himself, and the money and how he came to make it,and how it was all wrong, but it has never been his personal dishonorthat was involved. This invention of the Idol gives him more powerthan ever, and he is going to use it to reorganize things so thateverybody will make more for their work and belong in the business. Hehas appointed Judge Luttrell one of the lawyers and Mr. Chadwell oneof the directors--and he is going to try to stay in Byrdsville most ofthe time and I am to help him arrange about keeping out of thetemptation of riches."And I'll try not to develop Byrdsville anymore than I can help,Phil," he said as he wiped my eyes on his handkerchief and then hisown.No, I hope Byrdsville will stay just as it is, and I hope that any onewho needs friends like I did will find Byrdsville, Tennessee, on themap.

Such a contention of course required to be dealtwith, and led me to collect information bearing upon temperature in allits aspects, and so enlarging my criticism that I saw it would benecessary to issue it in book form.Two of my mathematical friends have pointed out the chief omission whichvitiates Professor Lowell's mathematical conclusions--that of a failureto recognise the very large conservative and _cumulative_ effect of adense atmosphere. This very point however I had already myself discussedin Chapter VI., and by means of some remarkable researches on the heatof the moon and an investigation of the causes of its very lowtemperature, I have, I think, demonstrated the incorrectness of Mr.Lowell's results. In my last chapter, in which I briefly summarise thewhole argument, I have further strengthened the case for very severecold in Mars, by adducing the rapid lowering of temperature universallycaused by diminution of atmospheric pressure, as manifested in thewell-known phenomenon of temperate climates at moderate heights evenclose to the equator, cold climates at greater heights even on extensiveplateaux, culminating in arctic climates and perpetual snow at heightswhere the air is still far denser than it is on the surface of Mars.This argument itself is, in my opinion, conclusive; but it is enforcedby two others equally complete, neither of which is adequately met byMr. Lowell.The careful examination which I have been led to give to the whole ofthe phenomena which Mars presents, and especially to the discoveries ofMr. Lowell, has led me to what I hope will be considered a satisfactoryphysical explanation of them. This explanation, which occupies the wholeof my seventh chapter, is founded upon a special mode of origin forMars, derived from the Meteoritic Hypothesis, now very widely adopted byastronomers and physicists. Then, by a comparison with certainwell-known and widely spread geological phenomena, I show how the greatfeatures of Mars--the 'canals' and 'oases'--may have been caused. Thischapter will perhaps be the most interesting to the general reader, asfurnishing a quite natural explanation of features of the planet whichhave been termed 'non-natural' by Mr. Lowell.Incidentally, also, I have been led to an explanation of the highlyvolcanic nature of the moon's surface. This seems to me absolutely torequire some such origin as Sir George Darwin has given it, and thusfurnishes corroborative proof of the accuracy of the hypothesis that ourmoon has had an unique origin among the known satellites, in having beenthrown off from the earth itself.I am indebted to Professor J. H. Poynting, of the University ofBirmingham, for valuable suggestions on some of the more difficultpoints of mathematical physics here discussed, and also for the criticalnote (at the end of Chapter V.) on Professor Lowell's estimate of thetemperature of Mars.BROADSTONE, DORSET, _October_ 1907.TABLE OF CONTENTS.CHAPTER I.EARLY OBSERVERS OF MARS,--Mars the only planet the surface of which is  distinctly visible--Early observation of the snow-caps and seas--The 'canals' seen by Schiaparelli in 1877--Double canals first seen in 1881--Round spots at intersection of canals seen  by Pickering in 1892--Confirmed by Lowell in 1894--Changes of colour seen in 1892 and 1894--Existence of seas doubted by Pickering and  Barnard in 1894.CHAPTER II.MR.

Of Venus we probably see only the upper surface ofits cloudy atmosphere.[1] As regards Jupiter and Saturn this is stillmore certain, since their low density will only permit of acomparatively small proportion of their huge bulk being solid. Theirbelts are but the cloud-strata of their upper atmosphere, perhapsthousands of miles above their solid surfaces, and a somewhat similarcondition seems to prevail in the far more remote planets Uranus andNeptune. It has thus happened, that, although as telescopic objects ofinterest and beauty, the marvellous rings of Saturn, the belts andever-changing aspects of the satellites of Jupiter, and the moon-likephases of Venus, together with its extreme brilliancy, still remainunsurpassed, yet the greater amount of details of these features whenexamined with the powerful instruments of the nineteenth century haveneither added much to our knowledge of the planets themselves or led toany sensational theories calculated to attract the popular imagination.[Footnote 1: Mercury also seems to have a scanty atmosphere, but as itsmass is only one-thirtieth that of the earth it can retain only theheavier gases, and its atmosphere may be dust-laden, as is that of Mars,according to Mr. Lowell. Its dusky markings, as seen by Schiaparelli,seem to be permanent, and they are also for considerable periodsunchangeable in position, indicating that the planet keeps the same facetowards the sun as does Venus. This was confirmed by Mr. Lowell in 1896.Its distance from us and unfavourable position for observation mustprevent us from obtaining any detailed knowledge of its actual surface,though its low reflective power indicates that the surface may be reallyvisible.]But in the case of Mars the progress of discovery has had a verydifferent result. The most obvious peculiarity of this planet--its polarsnow-caps--were seen about 250 years ago, but they were first proved toincrease and decrease alternately, in the summer and winter of eachhemisphere, by Sir William Herschell in the latter part of theeighteenth century. This fact gave the impulse to that idea ofsimilarity in the conditions of Mars and the earth, which therecognition of many large dusky patches and streaks as water, and themore ruddy and brighter portions as land, further increased. Added tothis, a day only about half an hour longer than our own, and asuccession of seasons of the same character as ours but of nearly doublethe length owing to its much longer year, seemed to leave little wantingto render this planet a true earth on a smaller scale. It was thereforevery natural to suppose that it must be inhabited, and that we shouldsome day obtain evidence of the fact._The Canals discovered by Schiaparelli._Hence the great interest excited when Schiaparelli, at the MilanObservatory, during the very favourable opposition of 1877 and 1879,observed that the whole of the tropical and temperate regions from 60 deg.N. to 60 deg. S. Lat. were covered with a remarkable network of broadercurved and narrower straight lines of a dark colour. At each successivefavourable opposition, these strange objects called _canali_ (channels)by their discoverer, but rather misleadingly 'canals' in England andAmerica, were observed by means of all the great telescopes in theworld, and their reality and general features became well established.In Schiaparelli's first map they were represented as being much broaderand less sharply defined than he himself and other observers found bylater and equally favourable observations that they really were._Discovery of the Double Canals._In 1881 another strange feature was discovered by Schiaparelli, whofound that about twenty canals which had previously been seen singlewere now distinctly double, that is, that they consisted of two parallellines, equally distinct and either very close together or a considerabledistance apart. This curious appearance was at first thought to be dueto some instrumental defect or optical illusion; but as it was soonconfirmed by other observers with the best instruments and in widelydifferent localities it became in time accepted as a real phenomenon ofthe planet's surface._Round Spots discovered in_ 1892.At the favourable opposition of 1892, Mr. W. H. Pickering noticed thatbesides the 'seas' of various sizes there were numerous very small blackspots apparently quite circular and occurring at every intersection orstarting-point of the 'canals.' Many of these had been seen bySchiaparelli as larger and ill-defined dark patches, and were termedseas or lakes; but Mr. Pickering's observatory was at Arequipa in Peru,about 8000 feet above the sea, and with such perfect atmosphericconditions as were, in his opinion, equal to a doubling of telescopicaperture. They were soon detected by other observers, especially by Mr.Lowell in 1894, who thus wrote of them:"Scattered over the orange-ochre groundwork of the continental regionsof the planet, are any number of dark round spots. How many there may beit is not possible to state, as the better the seeing, the more of themthere seem to be. In spite, however, of their great number, there is noinstance of one unconnected with a canal. What is more, there isapparently none that does not lie at the junction of several canals.Reversely, all the junctions appear to be provided with spots. Plottedupon a globe they and their connecting canals make a most curiousnetwork over all the orange-ochre equatorial parts of the planet, a massof lines and knots, the one marking being as omnipresent as the other."_Changes of Colour recognised._During the oppositions of 1892 and 1894 it was fully recognised that aregular course of change occurred dependent upon the succession of theseasons, as had been first suggested by Schiaparelli. As the polar snowsmelt the adjacent seas appear to overflow and spread out as far as thetropics, and are often seen to assume a distinctly green colour. Theseremarkable changes and the extraordinary phenomena of perfect straightlines crossing each other over a large portion of the planet's surface,with the circular spots at their intersections, had such an appearanceof artificiality that the idea that they were really 'canals' made byintelligent beings for purposes of irrigation, was first hinted at, andthen adopted as the only intelligible explanation, by Mr. Lowell and afew other persons. This at once seized upon the public imagination andwas spread by the newspapers and magazines over the whole civilisedworld._Existence of Seas doubted._At this time (1894) it began to be doubted whether there were any seasat all on Mars. Professor Pickering thought they were far more limitedin size than had been supposed, and even might not exist as true seas.Professor Barnard, with the Lick thirty-six inch telescope, discerned anastonishing wealth of detail on the surface of Mars, so intricate,minute, and abundant, that it baffled all attempts to delineate it; andthese peculiarities were seen upon the supposed seas as well as on theland-surfaces. In fact, under the best conditions these 'seas' lost alltrace of uniformity, their appearance being that of a mountainouscountry, broken by ridges, rifts, and canyons, seen from a greatelevation. As we shall see later on these doubts soon becamecertainties, and it is now almost universally admitted that Marspossesses no permanent bodies of water.CHAPTER II.MR. PERCIVAL LOWELL'S DISCOVERIES AND THEORIES._The Observatory in Arizona._In 1894, after a careful search for the best atmospheric conditions, Mr.Lowell established his observatory near the town of Flagstaff inArizona, in a very dry and uniform climate, and at an elevation of 7300feet above the sea. He then possessed a fine equatorial telescope of 18inches aperture and 26 feet focal length, besides two smaller ones, allof the best quality. To these he added in 1896 a telescope with 24 inchobject glass, the last work of the celebrated firm of Alvan Clark &Sons, with which he has made his later discoveries. He thus becameperhaps more favourably situated than any astronomer in the northernhemisphere, and during the last twelve years has made a specialty of thestudy of Mars, besides doing much valuable astronomical work on otherplanets._Mr, Lowell's recent Books upon Mars._In 1905 Mr. Lowell published an illustrated volume giving a full accountof his observations of Mars from 1894 to 1903, chiefly for the use ofastronomers; and he has now given us a popular volume summarising thewhole of his work on the planet, and published both in America andEngland by the Macmillan Company. This very interesting volume is fullyillustrated with twenty plates, four of them coloured, and more thanforty figures in the text, showing the great variety of details fromwhich the larger general maps have been constructed._Non-natural Features of Mars._But what renders this work especially interesting to all intelligentreaders is, that the author has here, for the first time, fully setforth his views both as to the habitability of Mars and as to its beingactually inhabited by beings comparable with ourselves in intellect. Thelarger part of the work is in fact devoted to a detailed description ofwhat he terms the 'Non-natural Features' of the planet's surface,including especially a full account of the 'Canals,' single and double;the 'Oases,' as he terms the dark spots at their intersections; and thevarying visibility of both, depending partly on the Martian seasons;while the five concluding chapters deal with the possibility of animallife and the evidence in favour of it. He also upholds the theory of thecanals having been constructed for the purpose of 'husbanding' thescanty water-supply that exists; and throughout the whole of thisargument he clearly shows that he considers the evidence to besatisfactory, and that the only intelligible explanation of the whole ofthe phenomena he so clearly sets forth is, that the inhabitants of Marshave carried out on their small and naturally inhospitable planet a vastsystem of irrigation-works, far greater both in its extent, in itsutility, and its effect upon their world as a habitation for civilisedbeings, than anything we have yet done upon our earth, where ourdestructive agencies are perhaps more prominent than those of animproving and recuperative character._A Challenge to the Thinking World._This volume is therefore in the nature of a challenge, not so much toastronomers as to the educated world at large, to investigate theevidence for so portentous a conclusion. To do this requires only ageneral acquaintance with modern science, more especially with mechanicsand physics, while the main contention (with which I shall chiefly deal)that the features termed 'canals' are really works of art andnecessitate the presence of intelligent organic beings, requires onlycare and judgment in drawing conclusions from admitted facts. As I havealready paid some attention to this problem and have expressed theopinion that Mars is not habitable,[2] judging from the evidence thenavailable, and as few men of science have the leisure required for acareful examination of so speculative a subject, I propose here to pointout what the facts, as stated by Mr. Lowell himself, do _not_ rendereven probable much less prove. Incidentally, I may be able to adduceevidence of a more or less weighty character, which seems to negativethe possibility of any high form of animal life on Mars, and, _afortiori_, the development of such life as might culminate in a beingequal or superior to ourselves. As most popular works on Astronomy forthe last ten years at least, as well as many scientific periodicals andpopular magazines, have reproduced some of the maps of Mars bySchiaparelli, Lowell, and others, the general appearance of its surfacewill be familiar to most readers, who will thus be fully able toappreciate Mr. Lowell's account of his own further discoveries which Imay have to quote. One of the _best_ of these maps I am able to give asa frontispiece to this volume, and to this I shall mainly refer.[Footnote 2: _Man's Place in the Universe_ p. 267 (1903).]_The Canals as described by Mr. Lowell._In the clear atmosphere of Arizona, Mr. Lowell has been able on variousfavourable occasions to detect a network of straight lines, meeting orcrossing each other at various angles, and often extending to a thousandor even over two thousand miles in length. They are seen to cross boththe light and the dark regions of the planet's surface, often extendingup to or starting from the polar snow-caps. Most of these lines are sofine as only to be visible on special occasions of atmospheric clearnessand steadiness, which hardly ever occur at lowland stations, even withthe best instruments, and almost all are seen to be as perfectlystraight as if drawn with a ruler._The Double Canals._Under exceptionally favourable conditions, many of the lines that havebeen already seen single appear double--a pair of equally fine linesexactly parallel throughout their whole length, and appearing, as Mr.Lowell says, "clear cut upon the disc, its twin lines like the rails ofa railway track." Both Schiaparelli and Lowell were at first sosurprised at this phenomenon that they thought it must be an opticalillusion, and it was only after many observations in different years,and by the application of every conceivable test, that they both becameconvinced that they witnessed a real feature of the planet's surface.Mr. Lowell says he has now seen them hundreds of times, and that hisfirst view of one was 'the most startlingly impressive' sight he hasever witnessed._Dimensions of the Canals._A few dimensions of these strange objects must be given in order thatreaders may appreciate their full strangeness and inexplicability. Outof more than four hundred canals seen and recorded by Mr. Lowell,fifty-one, or about one eighth, are either constantly or occasionallyseen to be double, the appearance of duplicity being more or lessperiodical. Of 'canals' generally, Mr. Lowell states that they vary inlength from a few hundred to a few thousand miles long, one of thelargest being the Phison, which he terms 'a typical double canal,' andwhich is said to be 2250 miles long, while the distance between its twoconstituents is about 130 miles.[3] The actual width of each canal isfrom a minimum of about a mile up to several miles, in one case overtwenty. A great feature of the doubles is, that they are strictlyparallel throughout their whole course, and that in almost all casesthey are so truly straight as to form parts of a great circle of theplanet's sphere. A few however follow a gradual but very distinct curve,and such of these as are double present the same strict parallelism asthose which are straight.[Footnote 3: This is on the opposite side of Mars from that shown in thefrontispiece.]_Canals extend across the Seas._It was only after seventeen years of observation of the canals that itwas found that they extended also into and across the dark spots andsurfaces which by the earlier observers were termed seas, and which thenformed the only clearly distinguishable and permanent marks on theplanet's surface. At the present time, Professor Lowell states that this"curious triangulation has been traced over almost every portion of theplanet's surface, whether dark or light, whether greenish, ochre, orbrown in colour." In some parts they are much closer together than inothers, "forming a perfect network of lines and spots, so that toidentify them all was a matter of extreme difficulty." Two such portionsare figured at pages 247 and 256 of Mr. Lowell's volume._The Oases._The curious circular black spots which are seen at the intersections ofmany of the canals, and which in some parts of the surface are verynumerous, are said to be more difficult of detection than even thelines, being often blurred or rendered completely invisible by slightirregularities in our own atmosphere, while the canals themselvescontinue visible. About 180 of these have now been found, and the moreprominent of them are estimated to vary from 75 to 100 miles indiameter. There are however many much smaller, down to minute and barelyvisible black points. Yet they all seem a little larger than the canalswhich enter them. Where the canals are double, the spots (or 'oases' asMr. Lowell terms them) lie between the two parallel canals.No one can read this book without admiration for the extremeperseverance in long continued and successful observation, the resultsof which are here recorded; and I myself accept unreservedly thesubstantial accuracy of the whole series. It must however always beremembered that the growth of knowledge of the detailed markings hasbeen very gradual, and that much of it has only been seen under veryrare and exceptional conditions. It is therefore quite possible that, ifat some future time a further considerable advance in instrumental powershould be made, or a still more favourable locality be found, the newdiscoveries might so modify present appearances as to render asatisfactory explanation of them more easy than it is at present.But though I wish to do the fullest justice to Mr. Lowell's technicalskill and long years of persevering work, which have brought to lightthe most complex and remarkable appearances that any of the heavenlybodies present to us, I am obliged absolutely to part company with himas regards the startling theory of artificial production which he thinksalone adequate to explain them. So much is this the case, that the veryphenomena, which to him seem to demonstrate the intervention ofintelligent beings working for the improvement of their own environment,are those which seem to me to bear the unmistakable impress of being dueto natural forces, while they are wholly unintelligible as being usefulworks of art. I refer of course to the great system of what are termed'canals,' whether single or double. Of these I shall give my owninterpretation later on.CHAPTER III.THE CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY OF MARS.Mr. Lowell admits, and indeed urges strongly, that there are nopermanent bodies of water on Mars; that the dark spaces and spots,thought by the early observers to be seas, are certainly not so now,though they may have been at an earlier period; that true clouds arerare, even if they exist, the appearances that have been taken for thembeing either dust-storms or a surface haze; that there is consequentlyno rain, and that large portions (about two-thirds) of the planet'ssurface have all the characteristics of desert regions._Snow-caps the only Source of Water._This state of things is supposed to be ameliorated by the fact of thepolar snows, which in the winter cover the arctic and about half thetemperate regions of each hemisphere alternately. The maximum of thenorthern snow-caps is reached at a period of the Martian wintercorresponding to the end of February with us. About the end of March thecap begins to shrink in size (in the Northern Hemisphere), and this goeson so rapidly that early in the June of Mars it is reduced to itsminimum. About the same time changes of colour take place in theadjacent darker portions of the surface, which become at first bluish,and later a decided blue-green; but by far the larger portion, includingalmost all the equatorial regions of the planet, remain always of areddish-ochre tint.[4][Footnote 4: In 1890 at Mount Wilson, California, Mr. W.H. Pickering'sphotographs of Mars on April 9th showed the southern polar cap ofmoderate dimensions, but with a large dim adjacent area. Twenty-fourhours later a corresponding plate showed this same area brilliantlywhite; the result apparently of a great Martian snowfall. In 1882 thesame observer witnessed the steady disappearance of 1,600,000 squaremiles of the southern snow-cap, an area nearly one-third of thathemisphere of the planet.]The rapid and comparatively early disappearance of the white coveringis, very reasonably, supposed to prove that it is of small thickness,corresponding perhaps to about a foot or two of snow in north-temperateAmerica and Europe, and that by the increasing amount of sun-heat it isconverted, partly into liquid and partly into vapour. Coincident withthis disappearance and as a presumed result of the water (or otherliquid) producing inundations, the bluish-green tinge which appears onthe previously dark portion of the surface is supposed to be due to arapid growth of vegetation.But the evidence on this point does not seem to be clear or harmonious,for in the four coloured plates showing the planet's surface atsuccessive Martian dates from December 30th to February 21st, not onlyis a considerable extent of the south temperate zone shown to changerapidly from bluish-green to chocolate-brown and then again tobluish-green, but the portions furthest from the supposed fertilisingoverflow are permanently green, as are also considerable portions in theopposite or northern hemisphere, which one would think would then becompletely dried up._No Hills upon Mars._The special point to which I here wish to call attention is this. Mr.Lowell's main contention is, that the surface of Mars is wonderfullysmooth and level. Not only are there no mountains, but there are nohills or valleys or plateaux. This assumption is absolutely essential tosupport the other great assumption, that the wonderful network ofperfectly straight lines over nearly the whole surface of the planet areirrigation canals. It is not alleged that irregularities or undulationsof a few hundreds or even one or two thousands of feet could possibly bedetected, while certainly all we know of planetary formation orstructure point strongly towards _some_ inequalities of surface. Mr.Lowell admits that the dark portions of the surface, when examined onthe terminator (the margin of the illuminated portion), do _look_ likehollows and _may be_ the beds of dried-up seas; yet the supposed canalsrun across these old sea-beds in perfect straight lines just as they doacross the many thousand miles of what are admitted to be deserts--whichhe describes in these forcible terms: "Pitiless as our deserts are, theyare but faint forecasts of the state of things existent on Mars at thepresent time."It appears, then, that Mr. Lowell has to face this dilemma--_Only if thewhole surface of Mars is an almost perfect level could the enormousnetwork of straight canals, each from hundreds to thousands of mileslong, have been possibly constructed by intelligent beings for purposesof irrigation; but, if a complete and universal level surface exists nosuch system would be necessary._ For on a level surface--or on asurface slightly inclined from the poles towards the equator, whichwould be advantageous in either case--the melting water would of itselfspread over the ground and naturally irrigate as much of the surface asit was possible for it to reach. If the surface were not level, butconsisted of slight elevations and expressions to the extent of a fewscores or a few hundreds of feet, then there would be no possibleadvantage in cutting straight troughs through these elevations invarious directions with water flowing at the bottom of them. In neithercase, and in hardly any conceivable case, could these perfectly straightcanals, cutting across each other in every direction and at very varyingangles, be of any use, or be the work of an intelligent race, if anysuch race could possibly have been developed under the adverseconditions which exist in Mars._The Scanty Water-supply._But further, if there were any superfluity of water derived from themelting snow beyond what was sufficient to moisten the hollows indicatedby the darker portions of the surface, which at the time the waterreaches them acquire a green tint (a superfluity under the circumstanceshighly improbable), that superfluity could be best utilised by widening,however little, the borders to which natural overflow had carried it.Any attempt to make that scanty surplus, by means of overflowing canals,travel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere, through such aterrible desert region and exposed to such a cloudless sky as Mr. Lowelldescribes, would be the work of a body of madmen rather than ofintelligent beings. It may be safely asserted that not one drop of waterwould escape evaporation or insoak at even a hundred miles from itssource. [5][Footnote 5: What the evaporation is likely to be in Mars may beestimated by the fact, stated by Professor J.W. Gregory in his recentvolume on 'Australia' in _Stanford's Compendium_, that in North-WestVictoria evaporation is at the rate of ten feet per annum, while inCentral Australia it is very much more. The greatly diminishedatmospheric pressure in Mars will probably more than balance the loss ofsun-heat in producing rapid evaporation.]_Miss Clerke on the Scanty Water-supply._On this point I am supported by no less an authority than the historianof modern astronomy, the late Miss Agnes Clerke. In the _EdinburghReview_ (of October 1896) there is an article entitled 'New Views aboutMars,' exhibiting the writer's characteristic fulness of knowledge andcharm of style. Speaking of Mr. Lowell's idea of the 'canals' carryingthe surplus water across the equator, far into the opposite hemisphere,for purposes of irrigation there (which we see he again states in thepresent volume), Miss Clerke writes: "We can hardly imagine so shrewd apeople as the irrigators of Thule and Hellas[6] wasting labour, and thelife-giving fluid, after so unprofitable a fashion. There is everyreason to believe that the Martian snow-caps are quite flimsystructures. Their material might be called snow _souffle_, since, owingto the small power of gravity on Mars, snow is almost three timeslighter there than here. Consequently, its own weight can have verylittle effect in rendering it compact. Nor, indeed, is there time formuch settling down. The calotte does not form until several months afterthe winter solstice, and it begins to melt, as a rule, shortly after thevernal equinox. (The interval between these two epochs in the southernhemisphere of Mars is 176 days.) The snow lies on the ground, at theoutside, a couple of months. At times it melts while it is still freshfallen. Thus, at the opposition of 1881-82 the spreading of the northernsnows was delayed until seven weeks after the equinox: and they had,accordingly, no sooner reached their maximum than they began to decline.And Professor Pickering's photographs of April 9th and 10th, 1890,proved that the southern calotte may assume its definitive proportionsin a single night.[Footnote 6: Areas on Mars so named.]"No attempt has yet been made to estimate the quantity of waterderivable from the melting of one of these formations; yet theexperiment is worth trying as a help towards defining ideas. Let usgrant that the average depth of snow in them, of the delicate Martiankind, is twenty feet, equivalent at the most to one foot of water. Themaximum area covered, of 2,400,000 square miles, is nearly equal to thatof the United States, while the whole globe of Mars measures 55,500,000square miles, of which one-third, on the present hypothesis, is undercultivation, and in need of water. Nearly the whole of the dark areas,as we know, are situated in the southern hemisphere, of which theyextend over, at the very least, 17,000,000 square miles; that is to say,they cover an area, in round numbers, seven times that of the snow-cap.Only one-seventh of a foot of water, accordingly, could possibly bemade available for their fertilisation, supposing them to get the entireadvantage of the spring freshet. Upon a stint of less than two inches ofwater these fertile lands are expected to flourish and bear abundantcrops; and since they completely enclose the polar area they arenecessarily served first. The great emissaries for carrying off thesurplus of their aqueous riches, would then appear to be superfluousconstructions, nor is it likely that the share in those riches due tothe canals and oases, intricately dividing up the wide, dry, continentalplains, can ever be realised."We have assumed, in our little calculation, that the entire contents ofa polar hood turn to water; but in actual fact a considerable proportionof them must pass directly into vapour, omitting the intermediate stage.Even with us a large quantity of snow is removed aerially; and in therare atmosphere of Mars this cause of waste must be especiallyeffective. Thus the polar reservoirs are despoiled in the act of beingopened. Further objections might be taken to Mr. Lowell's irrigationscheme, but enough has been said to show that it is hopelesslyunworkable."It will be seen that the writer of this article accepted the existenceof water on Mars, on the testimony of Sir W. Huggins, which, in view oflater observations, he has himself acknowledged to be valueless. Dr.Johnstone Stoney's proof of its absence, derived from the moleculartheory of gases, had not then been made public._Description of some of the Canals._At the end of his volume Mr. Lowell gives a large chart of Mars onMercator's projection, showing the canals and other features seen duringthe opposition of 1905. This contains many canals not shown on the maphere reproduced (see frontispiece), and some of the differences betweenthe two are very puzzling. Looking at our map, which shows thenorth-polar snow below, so that the south pole is out of the view at thetop of the map, the central feature is the large spot Ascraeeus Lucus,from which ten canals diverge centrally, and four from the sides,forming wide double canals, fourteen in all. There is also a canal namedUlysses, which here passes far to the right of the spot, but in thelarge chart enters it centrally. Looking at our map we see, goingdownwards a little to the left, the canal Udon, which runs through adark area quite to the outer margin. In the dark area, however, there isshown on the chart a spot Aspledon Lucus, where five canals meet, and ifthis is taken as a terminus the Udon canal is almost exactly 2000 mileslong, and another on its right, Lapadon, is the same length, while Ich,running in a slightly curved line to a large spot (Lucus Castorius onthe chart) is still longer. The Ulysses canal, which (on the chart) runsstraight from the point of the Mare Sirenum to the Astraeeus Lucus isabout 2200 miles long. Others however are even longer, and Mr. Lowellsays: "With them 2000 miles is common; while many exceed 2500; and theEumenides-Orcus is 3540 miles from the point where it leaves LucusPhoeniceus to where it enters the Trivium Charontis." This last canal isbarely visible on our map, its commencement being indicated by the wordEumenides.The Trivium Charontis is situated just beyond the right-hand margin ofour map. It is a triangular dark area, the sides about 200 miles long,and it is shown on the chart as being the centre from which radiatethirteen canals. Another centre is Aquae Calidae situated at the pointof a dark area running obliquely from 55 deg. to 35 deg. N. latitude, and, asshown on a map of the opposite hemisphere to our map, has nearly twentycanals radiating from it in almost every direction. Here at all eventsthere seems to be no special connection with the polar snow-caps, andthe radiating lines seem to have no intelligent purpose whatever, butare such as might result from fractures in a glass globe produced byfiring at it with very small shots one at a time. Taking the wholeseries of them, Mr. Lowell very justly compares them to "a network whichtriangulates the surface of the planet like a geodetic survey, intopolygons of all shapes and sizes."At the very lowest estimate the total length of the canals observed andmapped by Mr. Lowell must be over a hundred thousand miles, while heassures us that numbers of others have been seen over the whole surface,but so faintly or on such rare occasions as to elude all attempts to fixtheir position with certainty. But these, being of the same characterand evidently forming part of the same system, must also be artificial,and thus we are led to a system of irrigation of almost unimaginablemagnitude on a planet which has no mountains, no rivers, and no rain tosupport it; whose whole water-supply is derived from polar snows, theamount of which is ludicrously inadequate to need any such world-widesystem; while the low atmospheric pressure would lead to rapidevaporation, thus greatly diminishing the small amount of moisture thatis available. Everyone must, I think, agree with Miss Clerke, that, evenadmitting the assumption that the polar snows consist of frozen water,the excessively scanty amount of water thus obtained would render anyscheme of world-wide distribution of it hopelessly unworkable.The very remarkable phenomena of the duplication of many of the lines,together with the darkspots--the so-called oases--at theirintersections, are doubtless all connected in some unknown way with theconstitution and past history of the planet; but, on the theory of thewhole being works of art, they certainly do _not_ help to remove any ofthe difficulties which have been shown to attend the theory that thesingle lines represent artificial canals of irrigation with a strip ofverdure on each side of them produced by their overflow._Lowell on the Purpose of the Canals._Before leaving this subject it will be well to quote Mr. Lowell's ownwords as to the supposed perfectly level surface of Mars, and hisinterpretation of the origin and purpose of the 'canals':"A body of planetary size, if unrotating, becomes a sphere, except forsolar tidal deformation; if rotating, it takes on a spheroidal formexactly expressive, so far as observation goes, of the so-calledcentrifugal force at work. Mars presents such a figure, being flattenedout to correspond to its axial rotation. Its surface therefore is influid equilibrium, or, in other words, a particle of liquid at any pointof its surface at the present time would stay where it was devoid ofinclination to move elsewhere. Now the water which quickens the verdureof the canals moves from the pole down to the equator as the seasonadvances. This it does then irrespective of gravity. No natural forcepropels it, and the inference is forthright and inevitable that it isartificially helped to its end. There seems to be no escape from thisdeduction. Water only flows downhill, and there is no such thing asdownhill on a surface already in fluid equilibrium. A few canals mightpresumably be so situated that their flow could, by inequality ofterrane, lie equatorward, but not all....Now it is not in particular butby general consent that the canal-system of Mars develops from pole toequator. From the respective times at which the minima take place, itappears that the canal quickening occupies fifty-two days, as evidencedby the successive vegetal darkenings, to descend from latitude 72 deg. northto latitude 0 deg., a journey of 2650 miles. This gives for the water aspeed of fifty-one miles a day, or 2.1 miles an hour. The rate ofprogression is remarkably uniform, and this abets the deduction as toassisted transference. But the fact is more unnatural yet. The growthpays no regard to the equator, but proceeds across it as if it did notexist into the planet's other hemisphere. Here is something still moretelling than travel to this point. For even if we suppose, for the sakeof argument, that natural forces took the water down to the equator,their action must there be certainly reversed, and the equator prove adead-line, to pass which were impossible" (pp. 374-5).I think my readers will agree with me that this whole argument is one ofthe most curious ever put forth seriously by an eminent man of science.Because the polar compression of Mars is about what calculation shows itought to be in accordance with its rate of rotation, its surface is in astate of 'fluid equilibrium,' and must therefore be absolutely levelthroughout. But the polar compression of the earth equally agrees withcalculation; therefore its surface is also in 'fluid equilibrium';therefore it also ought to be as perfectly level on land as it is on theocean surface! But as we know this is very far from being the case, whymust it be so in Mars? Are we to suppose Mars to have been formed insome totally different way from other planets, and that there neither isnor ever has been any reaction between its interior and exterior forces?Again, the assumption of perfect flatness is directly opposed to allobservation and all analogy with what we see on the earth and moon. Itgives no account whatever of the numerous and large dark patches, oncetermed seas, but now found to be not so, and to be full of detailedmarkings and varied depths of shadow. To suppose that these are all thesame dead-level as the light-coloured portions are assumed to be,implies that the darkness is one of material and colour only, not ofdiversified contour, which again is contrary to experience, sincedifference of material with us always leads to differences in rate ofdegradation, and hence of diversified contour, as these dark spacesactually show themselves under favourable conditions to independentobservers._Lowell on the System of Canals as a whole._We will now see what Mr. Lowell claims to be the plain teaching of the'canals' as a whole:"But last and all-embracing in its import is the system which the canalsform. Instead of running at hap-hazard, the canals are interconnected ina most remarkable manner. They seek centres instead of avoiding them.The centres are linked thus perfectly one with another, an arrangementwhich could not result from centres, whether of explosion or otherwise,which were themselves discrete. Furthermore, the system covers the wholesurface of the planet, dark areas and light ones alike, a world-widedistribution which exceeds the bounds of natural possibility. Any forcewhich could act longitudinally on such a scale must be limitedlatitudinally in its action, as witness the belts of Jupiter and thespots upon the sun. Rotational, climatic, or other physical cause couldnot fail of zonal expression. Yet these lines are grandly indifferent tosuch competing influences. Finally, the system, after meshing thesurface in its entirety, runs straight into the polar caps."It is, then, a system whose end and aim is the tapping of the snow-capfor the water there semi-annually let loose; then to distribute it overthe planet's face" (p. 373).Here, again, we have curiously weak arguments adduced to support theview that these numerous straight lines imply works of art rather thanof nature, especially in the comparison made with the belts of Jupiterand the spots on the sun, both purely atmospheric phenomena, whereas thelines on Mars are on the solid surface of the planet. Why should therebe any resemblance between them? Every fact stated in the abovequotation, always keeping in mind the physical conditions of theplanet--its very tenuous atmosphere and rainless desert-surface--seemwholly in favour of a purely natural as opposed to an artificial origin;and at the close of this discussion I shall suggest one which seems tome to be at least possible, and to explain the whole series of thephenomena set forth and largely discovered by Mr. Lowell, in a simplerand more probable manner than does his tremendous assumption of theirbeing works of art. Readers who may not possess Mr. Lowell's volume willfind three of his most recent maps of the 'canals' reproduced in_Nature_ of October 11th, 1906.CHAPTER IV.IS ANIMAL LIFE POSSIBLE ON MARS?Having now shown, that, even admitting the accuracy of all Mr. Lowell'sobservations, and provisionally accepting all his chief conclusions asto the climate, the nature of the snow-caps, the vegetation, and theanimal life of Mars, yet his interpretation of the lines on its surfaceas being veritably 'canals,' constructed by intelligent beings for thespecial purpose of carrying water to the more arid regions, is whollyerroneous and rationally inconceivable. I now proceed to discuss hismore fundamental position as to the actual habitability of Mars by ahighly organised and intellectual race of material organic beings._Water and Air essential to Life._Here, fortunately, the issue is rendered very simple, because Mr. Lowellfully recognises the identity of the constitution of matter and ofphysical laws throughout the solar-system, and that for any high form oforganic life certain conditions which are absolutely essential on ourearth must also exist in Mars. He admits, for example, that water isessential, that an atmosphere containing oxygen, nitrogen, aqueousvapour, and carbonic acid gas is essential, and that an abundantvegetation is essential; and these of course involve asurface-temperature through a considerable portion of the year thatrenders the existence of these--especially of water--possible andavailable for the purposes of a high and abundant animal life._Blue Colour the only Evidence of Water._In attempting to show that these essentials actually exist on Mars he isnot very successful. He adduces evidence of an atmosphere, but of anexceedingly scanty one, since the greatest amount he can give to it is--"not more than about four inches of barometric pressure as we reckonit";[7] and he assumes, as he has a fair right to do till disproved,that it consists of oxygen and nitrogen, with carbon-dioxide andwater-vapour, in approximately the same proportions as with us. Withregard to the last item--the water-vapour--there are however manyserious difficulties. The water-vapour of our atmosphere is derived fromthe enormous area of our seas, oceans, lakes, and rivers, as well asfrom the evaporation from heated lands and tropical forests of much ofthe moisture produced by frequent and abundant rains. All these sourcesof supply are admittedly absent from Mars, which has no permanent bodiesof water, no rain, and tropical regions which are almost entirelydesert. Many writers have therefore doubted the existence of water inany form upon this planet, supposing that the snow-caps are not formedof frozen water but of carbon-dioxide, or some other heavy gas, in afrozen state; and Mr. Lowell evidently feels this to be a difficulty,since the only fact he is able to adduce in favour of the melting snowsof the polar caps producing water is, that at the time they are meltinga marginal blue band appears which accompanies them in their retreat,and this blue colour is said to prove conclusively that the liquid isnot carbonic acid but water. This point he dwells upon repeatedly,stating, of these blue borders: "This excludes the possibility of theirbeing formed by carbon-dioxide, and shows that of all the substances weknow the material composing them must be water."[Footnote 7: In a paper written since the book appeared the density ofair at the surface of Mars is said to be 1/12 of the earth's.]This is the only proof of the existence of _water_ he adduces, and it iscertainly a most extraordinary and futile one. For it is perfectly wellknown that although water, in large masses and by transmitted light, isof a blue colour, yet shallow water by reflected light is not so; and inthe case of the liquid produced by the snow-caps of Mars, which thewhole conditions of the planet show must be shallow, and also be more orless turbid, it cannot possibly be the cause of the 'deep blue' tintsaid to result from the melting of the snow.But there is a very weighty argument depending on the molecular theoryof gases against the polar caps of Mars being composed of frozen waterat all. The mass and elastic force of the several gases is due to thegreater or less rapidity of the vibratory motion of their moleculesunder identical conditions. The speed of these molecular motions hasbeen ascertained for all the chief gases, and it is found to be so greatas in certain cases to enable them to overcome the force of gravity andescape from a planet's surface into space. Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney hasspecially investigated this subject, and he finds that the force ofgravity on the earth is sufficient to retain all the gases composing itsatmosphere, but not sufficient to retain hydrogen; and as a consequence,although this gas is produced in small quantities by volcanoes and bydecomposing vegetation, yet no trace of it is found in our atmosphere.The moon however, having only one-eightieth the mass of the earth,cannot retain any gas, hence its airless and waterless condition._Water Vapour cannot exist on Mars._Now, Dr. Stoney finds that in order to retain water vapour permanently aplanet must have a mass at least a quarter that of the earth. But themass of Mars is only one-ninth that of the earth; therefore, unlessthere are some special conditions that prevent its loss, this gas cannotbe present in the atmosphere. Mr. Lowell does not refer to this argumentagainst his view, neither does he claim the evidence of spectroscopy inhis favour. This was alleged more than thirty years ago to show theexistence of water-vapour in the atmosphere of Mars, but of late yearsit has been doubted, and Mr. Lowell's complete silence on the subject,while laying stress on such a very weak and inconclusive argument asthat from the tinge of colour that is observed a little distance fromthe edge of the diminishing snow-caps, shows that he himself does notthink the fact to be thus proved. If he did he would hardly adduce suchan argument for its presence as the following: "The melting of the capson the one hand and their re-forming on the other affirm the presence ofwater-vapour in the Martian atmosphere, of whatever else that airconsists" (p. 162). Yet absolutely the only proof he gives that the capsare frozen water is the almost frivolous colour-argument above referredto!_No Spectroscopic Evidence of Water Vapour._As Sir William Huggins is the chief authority quoted for this fact, andis referred to as being almost conclusive in the third edition of MissClerke's _History of Astronomy_ in 1893, I have ascertained that hisopinion at the present time is that "there is no conclusive proof of thepresence of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere of Mars, and thatobservations at the Lick Observatory (in 1895), where the conditions andinstruments are of the highest order, were negative." He also informs methat Marchand at the Pic du Midi Observatory was unable to obtain linesof aqueous vapour in the spectrum of Mars; and that in 1905, Slipher, atMr. Lowell's observatory, was unable to detect any indications ofaqueous vapour in the spectrum of Mars.It thus appears that spectroscopic observations are quite accordant withthe calculations founded on the molecular theory of gases as to theabsence of aqueous vapour, and therefore presumably of liquid water,from Mars. It is true that the spectroscopic argument is purelynegative, and this may be due to the extreme delicacy of theobservations required; but that dependent on the inability of the forceof gravity to retain it is positive scientific evidence against itspresence, and, till shown to be erroneous, must be held to beconclusive.This absence of water is of itself conclusive against the existence ofanimal life, unless we enter the regions of pure conjecture as to thepossibility of some other liquid being able to take its place, and thatliquid being as omnipresent there as water is here. Mr. Lowell howevernever takes this ground, but bases his whole theory on the fundamentalidentity of the substance of the bodies of living organisms whereverthey may exist in the solar system. In the next two chapters I shalldiscuss an equally essential condition, that of temperature, whichaffords a still more conclusive and even crushing argument against thesuitability of Mars for the existence of organic life.CHAPTER V.THE TEMPERATURE OF MARS--MR. LOWELL'S ESTIMATE.We have now to consider a still more important and fundamental question,and one which Mr. Lowell does not grapple with in this volume, theactual temperatures on Mars due to its distance from the sun and theatmospheric conditions on which he himself lays so much stress. If I amnot greatly mistaken we shall arrive at conclusions on this subjectwhich are absolutely fatal to the conception of any high form of organiclife being possible on this planet._The Problem of Terrestrial Temperatures._In order that the problem may be understood and its importanceappreciated, it is necessary to explain the now generally acceptedprinciples as to the causes which determine the temperatures on ourearth, and, presumably, on all other planets whose conditions are notwholly unlike ours. The fact of the internal heat of the earth whichbecomes very perceptible even at the moderate depths reached in minesand deep borings, and in the deepest mines becomes a positiveinconvenience, leads many people to suppose that the surface-temperatures of the earth are partly due to this cause. But it is nowgenerally admitted that this is not the case, the reason being that allrocks and soils, in their natural compacted state, are exceedingly badconductors of heat.A striking illustration of this is the fact, that a stream of lava oftencontinues to be red hot at a few feet depth for years after the surfaceis consolidated, and is hardly any warmer than that of the surroundingland. A still more remarkable case is that of a glacier on thesouth-east side of the highest cone of Etna underneath a lava streamwith an intervening bed of volcanic sand only ten feet thick. This wasvisited by Sir Charles Lyell in 1828, and a second time thirty yearslater, when he made a very careful examination of the strata, and wasquite satisfied that the sand and the lava stream together had actuallypreserved this mass of ice, which neither the heat of the lava above itat its first outflow, nor the continued heat rising from the greatvolcano below it, had been able to melt or perceptibly to diminish inthirty years. Another fact that points in the same direction is theexistence over the whole floor of the deepest oceans of ice-cold water,which, originating in the polar seas, owing to its greater density sinksand creeps slowly along the ocean bottom to the depths of the Atlanticand Pacific, and is not perceptibly warmed by the internal heat of theearth.Now the solid crust of the earth is estimated as at least about twentymiles in average thickness; and, keeping in mind the other facts justreferred to, we can understand that the heat from the interior passesthrough it with such extreme slowness as not to be detected at thesurface, the varying temperatures of which are due entirely to solarheat. A large portion of this heat is stored up in the surface soil, andespecially in the surface layer of the oceans and seas, thus partlyequalising the temperatures of day and night, of winter and summer, soas greatly to ameliorate the rapid changes of temperature that wouldotherwise occur. Our dense atmosphere is also of immense advantage to usas an equaliser of temperature, charged as it almost always is with alarge quantity of water-vapour. This latter gas, when not condensed intocloud, allows the solar heat to pass freely to the earth; but it has thesingular and highly beneficial property of absorbing and retaining thedark or lower-grade heat given off by the earth which would otherwiseradiate into space much more rapidly. We must therefore always rememberthat, very nearly if not quite, the _whole_ of _the warmth we experienceon the earth is derived from the sun._[8][Footnote 8: Professor J.H. Poynting, in his lecture to the BritishAssociation at Cambridge in 1904, says: "The surface of the earthreceives, we know, an amount of heat from the inside almostinfinitesimal compared with that which it receives from the sun, and onthe sun, therefore, we depend for our temperature."]In order to understand the immense significance of this conclusion wemust know what is meant by the _whole_ heat or warmth; as unless we knowthis we cannot define what half or any other proportion of sun-heatreally means. Now I feel pretty sure that nine out of ten of the averageeducated public would answer the following question incorrectly: Themean temperature of the southern half of England is about 48 deg. F.Supposing the earth received only half the sun-heat it now receives,what would then be the probable mean temperature of the South ofEngland? The majority would, I think, answer at once--About 24 deg. F.Nearly as many would perhaps say--48 deg. F. is 16 deg. above the freezingpoint; therefore half the heat received would bring us down to 8 deg. abovethe freezing point, or 40 deg. F. Very few, I think, would realise that ourshare of half the amount of sun-heat received by the earth wouldprobably result in reducing our mean temperature to about 100 deg. F. belowthe freezing point, and perhaps even lower. This is about the verylowest temperature yet experienced on the earth's surface. To understandhow such results are obtained a few words must be said about theabsolute zero of temperature._The Zero of Temperature._Heat is now believed to be entirely due to ether-vibration, whichproduces a correspondingly rapid vibration of the molecules of matter,causing it to expand and producing all the phenomena we term 'heat.' Wecan conceive this vibration to increase indefinitely, and thus therewould appear to be no necessary limit to the amount of heat possible,but we cannot conceive it to decrease indefinitely at the same uniformrate, as it must soon inevitably come to nothing. Now it has been foundby experiment that gases under uniform pressure expand 1/273 of theirvolume for each degree Centigrade of increased temperature, so that inpassing from 0 deg. C. to 273 deg. C. they are doubled in volume. They alsodecrease in volume at the same rate for each degree below 0 deg. C. (thefreezing point of water). Hence if this goes on to-273 deg. C. a gas willhave no volume, or it will undergo some change of nature. Hence this iscalled the zero of temperature, or the temperature to which any matterfalls which receives no heat from any other matter. It is also sometimescalled the temperature of space, or of the ether in a state of rest, ifthat is possible. All the gases have now been proved to become, firstliquid and then (most of them) solid, at temperatures considerably abovethis zero.The only way to compare the proportional temperatures of bodies, whetheron the earth or in space, is therefore by means of a scale beginning atthis natural zero, instead of those scales founded on the artificialzero of the freezing point of water, or, as in Fahrenheit's, 32 deg. belowit. Only by using the natural zero and measuring continuously from itcan we estimate temperatures in relative proportion to the amount ofheat received. This is termed the absolute zero, and so that we startreckoning from that point it does not matter whether the scale adoptedis the Centigrade or that of Fahrenheit._The Complex Problem of Planetary Temperatures._Now if, as is the case with Mars, a planet receives only half the amountof solar heat that we receive, owing to its greater distance from thesun, and if the mean temperature of our earth is 60 deg. F., this is equalto 551 deg. F. on the absolute scale. It would therefore appear very simpleto halve this amount and obtain 275.5 deg. F. as the mean temperature ofthat planet. But this result is erroneous, because the actual amount ofsun heat intercepted by a planet is only one condition out of many thatdetermine its resulting temperature. Radiation, that is loss of heat, isgoing on concurrently with gain, and the rate of loss varies with thetemperature according to a law recently discovered, the loss being muchgreater at high temperatures in proportion to the 4th power of theabsolute temperature. Then, again, the whole heat intercepted by aplanet does not reach its surface unless it has no atmosphere. When ithas one, much is reflected or absorbed according to complex lawsdependent on the density and composition of the atmosphere. Then, again,the heat that reaches the actual surface is partly reflected and partlyabsorbed, according to the nature of that surface--land or water, desertor forest or snow-clad--that part which is absorbed being the chiefagent in raising the temperature of the surface and of the air incontact with it. Very important too is the loss of heat by radiationfrom these various heated surfaces at different rates; while theatmosphere itself sends back to the surface an ever varying portion ofboth this radiant and reflected heat according to distinct laws. Furtherdifficulties arise from the fact that much of the sun's heat consists ofdark or invisible rays, and it cannot therefore be measured by thequantity of light only.From this rough statement it will be seen that the problem is anexceedingly complex one, not to be decided off-hand, or by any simplemethod. It has in fact been usually considered as (strictly speaking)insoluble, and only to be estimated by a more or less roughapproximation, or by the method of general analogy from certain knownfacts. It will be seen, from what has been said in previous chapters,that Mr. Lowell, in his book, has used the latter method, and, by takingthe presence of water and water-vapour in Mars as proved by thebehaviour of the snow-caps and the bluish colour that results from theirmelting, has deduced a temperature above the freezing point of water, asprevalent in the equatorial regions permanently, and in the temperateand arctic zones during a portion of each year._Mr. Lowell's Mathematical Investigation of the Problem._But as this result has been held to be both improbable in itself andfounded on no valid evidence, he has now, in the _London, Edinburgh, andDublin Philosophical Magazine_ of July 1907, published an elaboratepaper of 15 pages, entitled _A General Method for Evaluating theSurface-Temperatures of the Planets; with special reference to theTemperature of Mars_, by Professor Percival Lowell; and in this paper,by what purports to be strict mathematical reasoning based on the mostrecent discoveries as to the laws of heat, as well as on measurements orestimates of the various elements and constants used in thecalculations, he arrives at a conclusion strikingly accordant with thatput forward in the recently published volume. Having myself neithermathematical nor physical knowledge sufficient to enable me to criticisethis elaborate paper, except on a few points, I will here limit myselfto giving a short account of it, so as to explain its method ofprocedure; after which I may add a few notes on what seem to me doubtfulpoints; while I also hope to be able to give the opinions of some morecompetent critics than myself._Mr. Lowell's Mode of Estimating the Surface-temperature of Mars._The author first states, that Professor Young, in his _GeneralAstronomy_ (1898), makes the mean temperature of Mars 223.6 deg. absolute,by using Newton's law of heat being radiated in proportion totemperature, and 363 deg. abs. (=-96 deg. F.) by Dulong and Petit's law; butadds, that a closer determination has been made by Professor Moulton,using Stefan's law, that radiation is as the _/4th_ power of thetemperature, whence results a mean temperature of-31 deg. F. These estimatesassume identity of atmospheric conditions of Mars and the Earth.But as none of these estimates take account of the many complex factorswhich interfere with such direct and simple calculations, Mr. Lowellthen proceeds to enunciate them, and work out mathematically the effectsthey produce:(1) The whole radiant energy of the sun on striking a planet becomesdivided as follows: Part is reflected back into space, part absorbed bythe atmosphere, part transmitted to the surface of the planet. Thissurface again reflects a portion and only the balance left goes to warmthe planet.(2) To solve this complex problem we are helped by the _albedoes_ orintrinsic brilliancy of the planets, which depend on the proportion ofthe visible rays which are reflected and which determines thecomparative brightness of their respective surfaces. We also have tofind the ratio of the invisible to the visible rays and the heatingpower of each.(3) He then refers to the actinometer and pyroheliometer, instrumentsfor measuring the actual heat derived from the sun, and also to theBolometer, an instrument invented by Professor Langley for measuring theinvisible heat rays, which he has proved to extend to more than threetimes the length of the whole heat-spectrum as previously known, andhas also shown that the invisible rays contribute 68 per cent, of thesun's total energy.[9][Footnote 9: For a short account of this remarkable instrument, see my_Wonderful Century_, new ed., pp. 143-145.](4) Then follows an elaborate estimate of the loss of heat during thepassage of the sun's rays through our atmosphere from experiments madeat different altitudes and from the estimated reflective power of thevarious parts of the earth's surface--rocks and soil, ocean, forest andsnow--the final result being that three-fourths of the whole sun-heatis reflected back into space, forming our _albedo_, while onlyone-fourth is absorbed by the soil and goes to warm the air anddetermine our mean temperature.(5) We now have another elaborate estimate of the comparative amounts ofheat actually received by Mars and the Earth, dependent on their verydifferent amounts of atmosphere, and this estimate depends almost whollyon the comparative _albedoes_, that of Mars, as observed by astronomersbeing 0.27, while ours has been estimated in a totally different way asbeing 0.75, whence he concludes that nearly three-fourths of thesun-heat that Mars receives reaches the surface and determines itstemperature, while we get only one-fourth of our total amount. Then byapplying Stefan's law, that the radiation is as the 4th power of thesurface temperature, he reaches the final result that the actual heatingpower at the surface of Mars is considerably _more_ than on the Earth,and would produce a mean temperature of 72 deg. F., if it were not for thegreater conservative or blanketing power of our denser and morewater-laden atmosphere. The difference produced by this latter fact heminimises by dwelling on the probability of a greater proportion ofcarbonic-acid gas and water-vapour in the Martian atmosphere, and thusbrings down the mean temperature of Mars to 48 deg. F., which is almostexactly the same as that of the southern half of England. He has also,as the result of observations, reduced the probable density of theatmosphere of Mars to 2-1/2 inches of mercury, or only one-twelfth ofthat of the Earth._Critical Remarks on Mr. Lowell's Paper._The last part of this paper, indicated under pars. 4 and 5, is the mostelaborate, occupying eight pages, and it contains much that seemsuncertain, if not erroneous. In particular, it seems very unlikely thatunder a clear sky over the whole earth we should only receive at thesea-level 0.23 of the solar rays which the earth intercepts (p. 167).These data largely depend on observations made in California and otherparts of the southern United States, where the lower atmosphere isexceptionally dust-laden. Till we have similar observations made in thetropical forest-regions, which cover so large an area, and where theatmosphere is purified by frequent rains, and also on the prairies andthe great oceans, we cannot trust these very local observations forgeneral conclusions affecting the whole earth. Later, in the samearticle (p. 170), Mr. Lowell says: "Clouds transmit approximately 20 percent. of the heat reaching them: a clear sky at sea-level 60 per cent.As the sky is half the time cloudy the mean transmission is 35 percent." These statements seem incompatible with that quoted above.The figure he uses in his calculations for the actual albedo of theearth, 0.75, is also not only improbable, but almost self-contradictory,because the albedo of cloud is 0.72, and that of the great cloud-coveredplanet, Jupiter, is given by Lowell as 0.75, while Zollner made it only0.62. Again, Lowell gives Venus an albedo of 0.92, while Zollner made itonly 0.50 and Mr. Gore 0.65. This shows the extreme uncertainty of theseestimates, while the fact that both Venus and Jupiter are whollycloud-covered, while we are only half-covered, renders it almostcertain that our albedo is far less than Mr. Lowell makes it. It isevident that mathematical calculations founded upon such uncertain datacannot yield trustworthy results. But this is by no means the only casein which the data employed in this paper are of uncertain value.Everywhere we meet with figures of somewhat doubtful accuracy. Here wehave somebody's 'estimate' quoted, there another person's 'observation,'and these are adopted without further remark and used in the variouscalculations leading to the result above quoted. It requires a practisedmathematician, and one fully acquainted with the extensive literature ofthis subject, to examine these various data, and track them through themaze of formulae and figures so as to determine to what extent theyaffect the final result.There is however one curious oversight which I must refer to, as it is apoint to which I have given much attention. Not only does Mr. Lowellassume, as in his book, that the 'snows' of Mars consist of frozenwater, and that therefore there _is_ water on its surface andwater-vapour in its atmosphere, not only does he ignore altogether Dr.Johnstone Stoney's calculations with regard to it, which I have alreadyreferred to, but he uses terms that imply that water-vapour is one ofthe heavier components of our atmosphere. The passage is at p. 168 ofthe _Philosophical Magazine._ After stating that, owing to the verysmall barometric pressure in Mars, water would boil at 110 deg. F., he adds:"The sublimation at lower temperatures would be correspondinglyincreased. Consequently the amount of water-vapour in the Martian airmust on that score be relatively greater than our own." Then followsthis remarkable passage: "Carbon-dioxide, because of its greaterspecific gravity, would also be in relatively greater amount so far asthis cause is considered. For the planet would part, _caeteris paribus_,with its lighter gases the quickest. Whence as regards both water-vapourand carbon-dioxide we have reason to think them in relatively greaterquantity than in our own air at corresponding barometric pressure." Icannot understand this passage except as implying that 'water-vapour andcarbon-dioxide' are among the heavier and not among the lighter gases ofthe atmosphere--those which the planet 'parts with quickest.' But thisis just what water-vapour _is_, being a little less than two-thirds theweight of air (0.6225), and one of those which the planet _would_ partwith the quickest, and which, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, itloses altogether.       *       *       *       *       *Note on Professor Lowell's article in the _Philosophical Magazine_; byJ.H. Poynting, F.R.S., Professor of Physics in the University ofBirmingham."I think Professor Lowell's results are erroneous through his neglect ofthe heat stored in the air by its absorption of radiation both from thesun and from the surface. The air thus heated radiates to the surfaceand keeps up the temperature. I have sent to the _PhilosophicalMagazine_ a paper in which I think it is shown that when the radiationby the atmosphere is taken into account the results are entirelychanged. The temperature of Mars, with Professor Lowell's data, stillcomes out far below the freezing-point--still further below than theincreased distance alone would make it. Indeed, the lower temperature onelevated regions of the earth's surface would lead us to expect this. Ithink it is impossible to raise the temperature of Mars to anything likethe value obtained by Professor Lowell, unless we assume some quality inhis atmosphere entirely different from any found in our own atmosphere."J.H. POYNTING. October 19, 1907.CHAPTER VI.A NEW ESTIMATE OF THE TEMPERATURE OF MARS.When we are presented with a complex problem depending on a great numberof imperfectly ascertained data, we may often check the results thusobtained by the comparison of cases in which some of the more importantof these data are identical, while others are at a maximum or a minimum.In the present case we can do this by a consideration of the Moon ascompared with the Earth and with Mars._Langley's Determination of the Moon's Temperature._In the moon we see the conditions that prevail in Mars both exaggeratedand simplified. Mars has a very scanty atmosphere, the moon none at all,or if there is one it is so excessively scanty that the most refinedobservations have not detected it. All the complications arising fromthe possible nature of the atmosphere, and its complex effects uponreflection, absorption, and radiation are thus eliminated. The meandistance of the moon from the sun being identical with that of theearth, the total amount of heat intercepted must also be identical; onlyin this case the whole of it reaches the surface instead of one-fourthonly, according to Mr. Lowell's estimate for the earth.Now, by the most refined observations with his Bolometer, Mr. Langleywas able to determine the temperature of the moon's surface exposed toundimmed sunshine for fourteen days together; and he found that, even inthat portion of it on which the sun was shining almost vertically, thetemperature rarely rose above the freezing point of water. Howeverextraordinary this result may seem, it is really a striking confirmationof the accuracy of the general laws determining temperature which I haveendeavoured to explain in the preceding chapter. For the same surfacewhich has had fourteen days of sunshine has also had a precedingfourteen days of darkness, during which the heat which it hadaccumulated in its surface layers would have been lost by free radiationinto stellar space. It thus acquires during its day a maximumtemperature of only 491 deg. F. absolute, while its minimum, after 14 days'continuous radiation, must be very low, and is, with much reason,supposed to approach the absolute zero._Rapid Loss of Heat by Radiation on the Earth._In order better to comprehend what this minimum may be under extremeconditions, it will be useful to take note of the effects it actuallyproduces on the earth in places where the conditions are nearest tothose existing on the moon or on Mars, though never quite equalling, oreven approaching very near them. It is in our great desert regions, andespecially on high plateaux, that extreme aridity prevails, and it is insuch districts that the differences between day and night temperaturesreach their maximum. It is stated by geographers that in parts of theGreat Sahara the surface temperature is sometimes 150 deg. F., while duringthe night it falls nearly or quite to the freezing point--a differenceof 118 degrees in little more than 12 hours.[10] In the high desertplains of Central Asia the extremes are said to be even greater.[11]Again, in his _Universal Geography_, Reclus states that in the ArmenianHighlands the thermometer oscillates between 13 deg. F. and 112 deg.F. We maytherefore, without any fear of exaggeration, take it as proved that afall of 100 deg. F. in twelve or fifteen hours not infrequently occurs wherethere is a very dry and clear atmosphere permitting continuousinsolation by day and rapid radiation by night.[Footnote 10: Keith Johnston's 'Africa' in _Stanford's Compendium._][Footnote 11: _Chambers's Encyclopaedia_, Art. 'Deserts.']Now, as it is admitted that our dense atmosphere, however dry and clear,absorbs and reflects some considerable portion of the solar heat, weshall certainly underestimate the radiation from the moon's surfaceduring its long night if we take as the basis of our calculation alowering of temperature amounting to 100 deg. F. during twelve hours, as notunfrequently occurs with us. Using these data--with Stefan's law ofdecrease of radiation as the 4th power of the temperature--amathematical friend finds that the temperature of the moon's surfacewould be reduced during the lunar night to nearly 200 deg. F. absolute(equal to-258 deg. F.)._More Rapid Loss of Heat by the Moon._Although such a calculation as the above may afford us a goodapproximation to the rate of loss of heat by Mars with its very scantyatmosphere, we have now good evidence that in the case of the moon theloss is much more rapid. Two independent workers have investigated thissubject with very accordant results--Dr. Boeddicker, with Lord Rosse's3-foot reflector and a Thermopile to measure the heat, and Mr. FrankVery, with a glass reflector of 12 inches diameter and the Bolometerinvented by Mr. Langley. The very striking and unexpected fact in whichthese observers agree is the sudden disappearance of much of thestored-up heat during the comparatively short duration of a totaleclipse of the moon--less than two hours of complete darkness, and abouttwice that period of partial obscuration.Dr. Boeddicker was unable to detect any appreciable heat at the periodof greatest obscuration; but, owing to the extreme sensitiveness of theBolometer, Mr. Very ascertained that those parts of the surface whichhad been longest in the shadow still emitted heat "to the amount of oneper cent. of the heat to be expected from the full moon." This howeveris the amount of radiation measured by the Bolometer, and to get thetemperature of the radiating surface we must apply Stefan's law of the4th power. Hence the temperature of the moon's dark surface will be the[fourth root of (1 over 100)] = 1 over 3.2 [A] of the highest temperature (which we may take at the freezing-point, 491 deg. F. abs.), or 154 deg. F. abs., just below the liquefaction point of air. This is about 50 deg. lower than theamount found by calculation from our most rapid radiation; and as thisamount is produced in a few hours, it is not too much to expect that,when continued for more than two weeks (the lunar night), it might reacha temperature sufficient to liquefy hydrogen (60 deg. F. abs.), or perhapseven below it.[Note A: LaTex markup \root 4  \of {1 \over 100}  = {1 \over 3.2}  ]_Theory of the Moon's Origin._This extremely rapid loss of heat by radiation, at first sight soimprobable as to be almost incredible, may perhaps be to some extentexplained by the physical constitution of the moon's surface, which,from a theoretical point of view, does not appear to have received theattention it deserves. It is clear that our satellite has been longsubjected to volcanic eruptions over its whole visible face, and thesehave evidently been of an explosive nature, so as to build up the verylofty cones and craters, as well as thousands of smaller ones, which,owing to the absence of any degrading or denuding agencies, haveremained piled up as they were first formed.This highly volcanic structure can, I think, be well explained by anorigin such as that attributed to it by Sir George Darwin, and which hasbeen so well described by Sir Robert Ball in his small volume, _Time andTide._ These astronomers adduce strong evidence that the earth oncerotated so rapidly that the equatorial protuberance was almost at thepoint of separation from the planet as a ring. Before this occurred,however, the tension was so great that one large portion of theprotuberance where it was weakest broke away, and began to move aroundthe earth at some considerable distance from it. As about 1/50 of thebulk of the earth thus escaped, it must have consisted of a considerableportion of the solid crust and a much larger quantity of the liquid orsemi-liquid interior, together with a proportionate amount of the gaseswhich we know formed, and still form, an important part of the earth'ssubstance.As the surface layers of the earth must have been the lightest, theywould necessarily, when broken up by this gigantic convulsion, have cometogether to form the exterior of the new satellite, and be soon adjustedby the forces of gravity and tidal disturbance into a more or lessirregular spheroidal form, all whose interstices and cavities would befilled up and connected together by the liquid or semi-liquid massforced up between them. Thence-forward, as the moon increased itsdistance and reduced its time of rotation, in the way explained by SirRobert Ball, there would necessarily commence a process of escape of theimprisoned gases at every fissure and at all points and lines ofweakness, giving rise to numerous volcanic outlets, which, beingsubjected only to the small force of lunar gravity (only one-sixth thatof the earth), would, in the course of ages, pile up those giganticcones and ridges which form its great characteristic.But this small gravitative power of the moon would prevent its retainingon its surface any of the gases forming our atmosphere, which would allescape from it and probably be recaptured by the earth. By no process ofexternal aggregation of solid matter to such a relatively small amountas that forming the moon, even if the aggregation was so violent as toproduce heat enough to cause liquefaction, could any suchlong-continued volcanic action arise by gradual cooling, in the absenceof internal gases. There might be fissures, and even some outflows ofmolten rock; but without imprisoned gases, and especially without waterand water-vapour producing explosive outbursts, could any such amount ofscoriae and ashes be produced as were necessary for the building up ofthe vast volcanic cones, craters, and craterlets we see upon the moon'ssurface.I am not aware that either Sir Robert Ball or Sir George Darwin haveadduced this highly volcanic condition of the moon's surface as aphenomenon which can _only_ be explained by our satellite having beenthrown off a very much larger body, whose gravitative force wassufficient to acquire and retain the enormous quantity of gases and ofwater which we possess, and which are _absolutely essential_ for that_special form of cone-building volcanic action_ which the moon exhibitsin so pre-eminent a degree. Yet it seems to me clear, that some suchhypothetical origin for our satellite would have had to be assumed ifSir George Darwin had not deduced it by means of purely mathematicalargument based upon astronomical facts.Returning now to the problem of the moon's temperature, I think thephenomena this presents may be in part due to the mode of formation heredescribed. For, its entire surface being the result of long-continuedgaseous explosions, all the volcanic products--scoriae, pumice, andashes--would necessarily be highly porous throughout; and, never havingbeen compacted by water-action, as on the earth, and there having beenno winds to carry the finer dust so as to fill up their pores andfissures, the whole of the surface material to a very considerable depthmust be loose and porous to a high degree. This condition has beenfurther increased owing to the small power of gravity and the extremeirregularity of the surface, consisting very largely of lofty cones andridges very loosely piled up to enormous heights.Now this condition of the substance of the moon's surface is such aswould produce a high specific heat, so that it would absorb a largeamount of heat in proportion to the rise of temperature produced, theheat being conducted downwards to a considerable depth. Owing, however,to the total absence of atmosphere radiation would very rapidly cool thesurface, but afterwards more slowly, both on account of the action ofStefan's law and because the heat stored up in the deeper portions couldbe carried to the surface by conduction only, and with extreme slowness._Very's Researches on the Moon's Heat._The results of the eclipse observations are supported by the detailedexamination of the surface-temperature of the moon by Mr. Very in his_Prize Essay on the Distribution of the Moon's Heat_ (published by theUtrecht Society of Arts and Sciences in 1891). He shows, by a diagram ofthe 'Phase-curve,' that at the commencement of the Lunar day the surfacejust within the illuminated limb has acquired about 1/7 of its maximumtemperature, or about 70 deg. F. abs. As the surface exposed to theBolometer at each observation is about 1/30 of the moon's surface, andin order to ensure accuracy the instrument has to be directed to a spotlying wholly within the edge of the moon, it is evident that the surfacemeasured has already been for several hours exposed to oblique sunshine.The curve of temperature then rises gradually and afterwards morerapidly, till it attains its maximum (of about +30 to 40 deg. F.) a fewhours _before_ noon. This, Mr. Very thinks, is due to the fact that thehalf of the moon's face first illuminated for us has, on the average, adarker surface than that of the afternoon, or second quarter, duringwhich the curve descends not quite so rapidly, the temperature nearsunset being only a little higher than that near sunrise. This rapidfall while exposed to oblique sunshine is quite in harmony with therapid loss of heat during the few hours of darkness during an eclipse,both showing the prepotency of radiation over insolation on the moon.Two other diagrams show the distribution of heat at the time offull-moon, one half of the curve showing the temperatures along theequator from the edge of the disc to the centre, the other along ameridian from this centre to the pole. This diagram (here reproduced)exhibits the quick rise of temperature of the oblique rim of the moonand the nearly uniform heat of the central half of its surface; thediminution of heat towards the pole, however, is slower for the firsthalf and more rapid for the latter portion.It is an interesting fact that the temperature near the margin of thefull-moon increases towards the centre more rapidly than it does whenthe same parts are observed during the early phases of the firstquarter. Mr. Very explains this difference as being due to the fact thatthe full-moon to its very edges is fully illuminated, all the shadows ofthe ridges and mountains being thrown vertically or obliquely _behindthem._ We thus measure the heat reflected from the _whole_ visiblesurface. But at new moon, and somewhat beyond the first quarter, thedeep shadows thrown by the smallest cones and ridges, as well as by theloftiest mountains, cover a considerable portion of the visible surface,thus largely reducing the quantity of light and heat reflected orradiated in our direction. It is only at the full, therefore, that themaximum temperature of the whole lunar surface can be measured. It mustbe considered a proof of the delicacy of the heat-measuring instrumentsthat this difference in the curves of temperature of the different partsof the moon's surface and under different conditions is so clearlyshown._The Application of the Preceding Results to the Case of Mars._This somewhat lengthy account of the actual state of the moon's surfaceand temperature is of very great importance in our present enquiry,because it shows us the extraordinary difference in mean and extremetemperatures of two bodies situated at the same distance from the sun,and therefore receiving exactly the same amount of solar heat per unitof surface. We have learned also what are the main causes of this almostincredible difference, namely: (1) a remarkably rugged surface withporous and probably cavernous rock-texture, leading to extremely rapidradiation of heat in the one; as compared with a comparatively even andwell-compacted surface largely clad with vegetation, leading tocomparatively slow and gradual loss by radiation in the other: and (2),these results being greatly intensified by the total absence of aprotecting atmosphere in the former, while a dense and cloudy atmospherewith an ever-present supply of water-vapour, accumulates and equalisesthe heat received by the latter.The only other essential difference in the two bodies which may possiblyaid in the production of this marvellous result, is the fact of our dayand night having a mean length of 12 hours, while those of the moon areabout 14-1/2 of our days. But the altogether unexpected fact, in whichtwo independent enquirers agree, that during the few hours' duration ofa total eclipse of the moon so large a proportion of the heat is lost byradiation renders it almost certain that the resulting low temperaturewould be not very much less if the moon had a day and night the samelength as our own.The great lesson we learn by this extreme contrast of conditionssupplied to us by nature, as if to enable us to solve some of herproblems, is, the overwhelming importance, first, of a dense andwell-compacted surface, due to water-action and strong gravitativeforce; secondly, of a more or less general coat of vegetation; and,thirdly, of a dense vapour-laden atmosphere. These three favourableconditions result in a mean temperature of about +60 deg. F. with a rangeseldom exceeding 40 deg. above or below it, while over more than half theland-surface of the earth the temperature rarely falls below thefreezing point. On the other hand, we have a globe of the same materialsand at the same distance from the sun, with a maximum temperature offreezing water, and a minimum not very far from the absolute zero, themonthly mean being probably much below the freezing point ofcarbonic-acid gas--a difference entirely due to the absence of thesethree favourable conditions._The Special Features of Mars as influencing Temperature._Coming now to the special feature of Mars and its probable temperature,we find that most writers have arrived at a very different conclusionfrom that of Mr. Lowell, who himself quotes Mr. Moulton as an authoritywho 'recently, by the application of Stefan's law,' has found the meantemperature of this planet to be-35 deg. F. Again, Professor J.H. Poynting,in his lecture on 'Radiation in the Solar System,' delivered before theBritish Association at Cambridge in 1904, gave an estimate of the meantemperature of the planets, arrived at from measurements of the sun'semissive power and the application of Stefan's law to the distances ofthe several planets, and he thus finds the earth to have a meantemperature of 17 deg. C. (=62-1/2 deg. F.) and Mars one of-38 deg. C. (=-36-1/2 deg.F.), a wonderfully close approximation to the mean temperature of theearth as determined by direct measurement, and therefore, presumably, anequally near approximation to that of Mars as dependent on distance fromthe sun, and '_on the supposition that it is earth-like in all itsconditions._'But we know that it is far from being earth-like in the very conditionswhich we have found to be those which determine the extremely differenttemperatures of the earth, and moon; and, as regards each of these, weshall find that, so far as it differs from the earth, it approximates tothe less favourable conditions that prevail in the moon. The first ofthese conditions which we have found to be essential in regulating theabsorption and radiation of heat, and thus raising the mean temperatureof a planet, is a compact surface well covered with vegetation, twoconditions arising from, and absolutely dependent on, an ample amount ofwater. But Mr. Lowell himself assures us, as a fact of which he has nodoubt, that there are no permanent bodies of water, great or small, uponMars; that rain, and consequently rivers, are totally wanting; that itssky is almost constantly clear, and that what appear to be clouds arenot formed of water-vapour but of dust. He dwells, emphatically, on theterrible desert conditions of the greater part of the surface of theplanet.That being the case now, we have no right to assume that it has everbeen otherwise; and, taking full account of the fact, neither denied nordisputed by Mr. Lowell, that the force of gravity on Mars is notsufficient to retain water-vapour in its atmosphere, we must concludethat the surface of that planet, like that of the moon, has been mouldedby some form of volcanic action modified probably by wind, but not bywater. Adding to this, that the force of gravity on Mars is nearer thatof the moon than to that of the earth, and we may r reasonably concludethat its surface is formed of volcanic matter in a light and porouscondition, and therefore highly favourable for the rapid loss of surfaceheat by radiation. The surface-conditions of Mars are therefore,presumably, much more like those of the moon than like those of theearth.The next condition favourable to the storing up of heat--a covering ofvegetation--is almost certainly absent from Mars except, possibly, overlimited areas and for short periods. In this feature also the surface ofMars approximates much nearer to lunar than to earth-conditions. Thethird condition--a dense, vapour-laden atmosphere--is also wanting inMars. For although it possesses an atmosphere it is estimated by Mr.Lowell (in his latest article) to have a pressure equivalent to only2-1/2 inches of mercury with us, giving it a density of only one-twelfthpart that of ours; while aqueous vapour, the chief accumulator of heat,cannot permanently exist in it, and, notwithstanding repeatedspectroscopic observations for the purpose of detecting it, has neverbeen proved to exist.I submit that I have now shown from the statements--and largely as theresult of the long-continued observations--of Mr. Lowell himself, that,so far as the physical conditions of Mars are known to differ from thoseof the earth, the differences are all _unfavourable_ to the conservationand _favourable_ to the dissipation of the scanty heat it receives fromthe sun--that they point unmistakeably towards the temperatureconditions of the moon rather than to those of the earth, and that thecumulative effect of these adverse conditions, acting upon aheat-supply, reduced by solar distance to less than one-half of ours,_must_ result in a mean temperature (as well as in the extremes) nearerto that of our satellite than to that of our own earth._Further Criticism of Mr. Lowell's Article._We are now in a position to test some further conclusions of Mr.Lowell's _Phil. Mag._ article by comparison with actual phenomena. Wehave seen, in the outline I have given of this article, that heendeavours to show how the small amount of solar heat received by Marsis counterbalanced, largely by the greater transparency to light andheat of its thin and cloudless atmosphere, and partially also by agreater conservative or 'blanketing' power of its atmosphere due to thepresence in it of a large proportion of carbonic acid gas and aqueousvapour. The first of these statements may be admitted as a fact which heis entitled to dwell upon, but the second--the presence of largequantities of carbon-dioxide and aqueous vapour is a pure hypothesisunsupported by any item of scientific evidence, while in the case ofaqueous vapour it is directly opposed to admitted results founded uponthe molecular theory of gaseous elasticity. But, although Mr. Lowellrefers to the conservative or 'blanketing' effect of the earth'satmosphere, he does not consider or allow for its very great cumulativeeffect, as is strikingly shown by the comparison with the actualtemperature conditions of the moon. This cumulative effect is due to the_continuous_ reflection and radiation of heat from the clouds as well asfrom the vapour-laden strata of air in our lower atmosphere, whichlatter, though very transparent to the luminous and accompanying heatrays of the sun, are opaque to the dark heat-rays whether radiated orreflected from the earth's surface. We are therefore in a positionstrictly comparable with that of the interior of some huge glass house,which not only becomes intensely heated by the direct rays of the sun,but also to a less degree by reflected rays from the sky and thoseradiated from the clouds, so that even on a cloudy or misty day itstemperature rises many degrees above that of the outer air. Such abuilding, if of large size, of suitable form, and well protected atnight by blinds or other covering, might be so arranged as to accumulateheat in its soil and walls so as to maintain a tolerably uniformtemperature though exposed to a considerable range of external heat andcold. It is to such a power of accumulation of heat in our soil andlower atmosphere that we must impute the overwhelming contrast betweenour climate and that of the moon. With us, the solar heat thatpenetrates our vapour-laden and cloudy atmosphere is shut in by thatsame atmosphere, accumulates there for weeks and months together, andcan only slowly escape. It is this great cumulative power which Mr.Lowell has not taken account of, while he certainly has not estimatedthe enormous loss of heat by free radiation, which entirely neutralisesthe effects of increase of sun-heat, however great, when thesecumulative agencies are not present.[12][Footnote 12: The effects of this 'cumulative' power of a denseatmosphere are further discussed and illustrated in the last chapter ofthis book, where I show that the universal fact of steadily diminishingtemperatures at high altitudes is due solely to the diminution of thiscumulative power of our atmosphere, and that from this cause alone thetemperature of Mars must be that which would be found on a lofty plateauabout 18,000 feet higher than the average of the peaks of the Andes!]_Temperature on Polar Regions of Mars._There is also a further consideration which I think Mr. Lowell hasaltogether omitted to discuss. Whatever may be the _mean_ temperatureof Mars, we must take account of the long nights in its polar andhigh-temperate latitudes, lasting nearly twice as long as ours, with theresulting lowering of temperature by radiation into a constantly clearsky. Even in Siberia, in Lat. 67-1/2 deg.N. a cold of-88 deg.F. has beenattained; while over a large portion of N. Asia and America above 60 deg.Lat. the _mean_ January temperature is from-30 deg.F. to-60 deg.F., and thewhole subsoil is permanently frozen from a depth of 6 or 7 feet toseveral hundreds. But the winter temperatures, _over the same latitudes_in Mars, must be very much lower; and it must require a proportionallylarger amount of its feeble sun-heat to raise the surface even to thefreezing-point, and an additional very large amount to melt anyconsiderable depth of snow. But this identical area, from a little below60 deg. to the pole, is that occupied by the snow-caps of Mars, and over thewhole of it the winter temperature must be far lower than theearth-minimum of-88 deg.F. Then, as the Martian summer comes on, there isless than half the sun-heat available to raise this low temperatureafter a winter nearly double the length of ours. And when the summerdoes come with its scanty sun-heat, that heat is not accumulated as itis by our dense and moisture-laden atmosphere, the marvellous effects ofwhich we have already shown. Yet with all these adverse conditions, eachassisting the other to produce a climate approximating to that which theearth would have if it had no atmosphere (but retaining our superiorityover Mars in receiving double the amount of sun-heat), we are asked toaccept a mean temperature for the more distant planet almost exactly thesame as that of mild and equable southern England, and a disappearanceof the vast snowfields of its polar regions as rapid and complete aswhat occurs with us! If the moon, even at its equator, has not itstemperature raised above the freezing-point of water, how can the more_distant_ Mars, with its _oblique_ noon-day sun falling upon thesnow-caps, receive heat enough, first to raise their temperature to 32 deg.F., and then to melt with marked rapidity the vast frozen plains of itspolar regions?Mr. Lowell is however so regardless of the ordinary teachings ofmeteorological science that he actually accounts for the supposed mildclimate of the polar regions of Mars by the absence of water on itssurface and in its atmosphere. He concludes his fifth chapter with thefollowing words: "Could our earth but get rid of its oceans, we toomight have temperate regions stretching to the poles." Here he runscounter to two of the best-established laws of terrestrial climatology--the wonderful equalising effects of warm ocean-currents which are thechief agents in diminishing polar cold; the equally striking effects ofwarm moist winds derived from these oceans, and the great storehouse ofheat we possess in our vapour-laden atmosphere, its vapour beingprimarily derived from these same oceans! But, in Mr. Lowell's opinion,all our meteorologists are quite mistaken. Our oceans are our greatdrawbacks. Only get rid of them and we should enjoy the exquisiteclimate of Mars--with its absence of clouds and fog, of rain or rivers,and its delightful expanses of perennial deserts, varied towards thepoles by a scanty snow-fall in winter, the melting of which might, withgreat care, supply us with the necessary moisture to grow wheat andcabbages for about one-tenth, or more likely one-hundredth, of ourpresent population. I hope I may be excused for not treating such anargument seriously. The various considerations now advanced, especiallythose which show the enormous cumulative and conservative effect of ourdense and water-laden atmosphere, and the disastrous effect--judging bythe actual condition of the moon--which the loss of it would have uponour temperature, seem to me quite sufficient to demonstrate importanterrors in the data or fallacies in the complex mathematical argument bywhich Mr. Lowell has attempted to uphold his views as to the temperatureand consequent climatic conditions of Mars. In concluding this portionof my discussion of the problem of Mars, I wish to call attention to thefact that my argument, founded upon a comparison of the physicalconditions of the earth and moon with those of Mars, is dependent upon asmall number of generally admitted scientific facts; while theconclusions drawn from those facts are simple and direct, requiring nomathematical knowledge to follow them, or to appreciate their weight andcogency. I claim for them, therefore, that they are in no degreespeculative, but in their data and methods exclusively scientific. Inthe next chapter I will put forward a suggestion as to how the verycurious markings upon the surface of Mars may possibly be interpreted,so as to be in harmony with the planet's actual physical condition andits not improbable origin and past history.CHAPTER VII.A SUGGESTION AS TO THE 'CANALS' OF MARS.The special characteristics of the numerous lines which intersect thewhole of the equatorial and temperate regions of Mars are, theirstraightness combined with their enormous length. It is this which hasled Mr. Lowell to term them 'non-natural features.' Schiaparelli, in hisearlier drawings, showed them curved and of comparatively great width.Later, he found them to be straight fine lines when seen under the bestconditions, just as Mr. Lowell has always seen them in the pureatmosphere of his observatory. Both of these observers were at firstdoubtful of their reality, but persistent observation continued at manysuccessive oppositions compelled acceptance of them as actual featuresof the planet's disc. So many other observers have now seen them thatthe objection of unreality seems no longer valid.Mr. Lowell urges, however, that their perfect straightness, theirextreme tenuity, their uniformity throughout their whole length, thedual character of many of them, their relation to the 'oases' and theform and position of these round black spots, are all proofs ofartificiality and are suggestive of design. And considering that some ofthem are actually as long as from Boston to San Francisco, andrelatively to their globe as long as from London to Bombay, hisobjection that "no natural phenomena within our knowledge show suchregularity on such a scale" seems, at first, a mighty one.It is certainly true that we can point to nothing exactly like themeither on the earth or on the moon, and these are the only two planetarybodies we are in a position to compare with Mars. Yet even these do, Ithink, afford us some hints towards an interpretation of the mysteriouslines. But as our knowledge of the internal structure and past historyeven of our earth is still imperfect, that of the moon only conjectural,and that of Mars a perfect blank, it is not perhaps surprising that thesurface-features of the latter do not correspond with those of either ofthe others._Mr. Pickering's Suggestion._The best clue to a natural interpretation of the strange features of thesurface of Mars is that suggested by the American astronomer Mr. W.H.Pickering in _Popular Astronomy_ (1904). Briefly it is, that both the'canals' of Mars and the rifts as well as the luminous streaks on themoon are cracks in the volcanic crust, caused by internal stresses dueto the action of the heated interior. These cracks he considers to besymmetrically arranged with regard to small 'craterlets' (Mr. Lowell's'oases') because they have originated from them, just as the whitestreaks on the moon radiate from the larger craters as centres. Hefurther supposes that water and carbon-dioxide issue from the interiorinto these fissures, and, in conjunction with sunlight, promote thegrowth of vegetation. Owing to the very rare atmosphere, the vapours, hethinks, would not ascend but would roll down the outsides of thecraterlets and along the borders of the canals, thus irrigating theimmediate vicinity and serving to promote the growth of some form ofvegetation which renders the canals and oases visible.[13][Footnote 13: _Nature_, vol. 70, p. 536.]This opinion is especially important because, next to Mr. Lowell, Mr.Pickering is perhaps the astronomer who has given most attention to Marsduring the last fifteen years. He was for some time at Flagstaff withMr. Lowell, and it was he who discovered the oases or craterlets, andwho originated the idea that we did not see the 'canals' themselves butonly the vegetable growth on their borders. He also observed Mars in theSouthern Hemisphere at Arequipa; and he has since made an elaboratestudy of the moon by means of a specially constructed telescope of 135feet focal length, which produced a direct image on photographic platesnearly 16 inches in diameter.[14][Footnote 14: _Nature_, vol. 70, May 5, p.xi, supplement.]It is clear therefore that Mr. Lowell's views as to the artificialnature of the 'canals' of Mars are not accepted by an astronomer ofequal knowledge and still wider experience. Yet Professor Pickering'salternative view is more a suggestion than an explanation, because thereis no attempt to account for the enormous length and perfectstraightness of the lines on Mars, so different from anything that isfound either on our earth or on the moon. There must evidently be somegreat peculiarity of structure or of conditions on Mars to account forthese features, and I shall now attempt to point out what thispeculiarity is and how it may have arisen._The Meteoritic Hypothesis._During the last quarter of a century a considerable change has come overthe opinions of astronomers as regards the probable origin of the SolarSystem. The large amount of knowledge of the stellar universe, andespecially of nebulae, of comets and of meteor-streams which we nowpossess, together with many other phenomena, such as the constitution ofSaturn's rings, the great number and extent of the minor planets, andgenerally of the vast amount of matter in the form of meteor-rings andmeteoric dust in and around our system, have all pointed to a differentorigin for the planets and their satellites than that formulated byLaplace as the Nebular hypothesis.It is now seen more clearly than at any earlier period, that most of theplanets possess special characteristics which distinguish them from oneanother, and that such an origin as Laplace suggested--the slow coolingand contraction of one vast sun-mist or nebula, besides presentinginherent difficulties--many think them impossibilities--in itself doesnot afford an adequate explanation of these peculiarities. Hence hasarisen what is termed the Meteoritic theory, which has been ablyadvocated for many years by Sir Norman Lockyer, and with someunimportant modifications is now becoming widely accepted. Briefly, thistheory is, that the planets have been formed by the slow aggregation ofsolid particles around centres of greatest condensation; but as many ofmy readers may be altogether unacquainted with it, I will here give avery clear statement of what it is, from Professor J.W. Gregory'spresidential address to the Geological Section of the BritishAssociation of the present year. He began by saying that these modernviews were of far more practical use to men of science than that ofLaplace, and that they give us a history of the world consistent withthe actual records of geology. He then continues:"According to Sir Norman Lockyer's Meteoritic Hypothesis, nebulae,comets, and many so-called stars consist of swarms of meteorites which,though normally cold and dark, are heated by repeated collisions, and sobecome luminous. They may even be volatilised into glowing meteoricvapour; but in time this heat is dissipated, and the force of gravitycondenses a meteoritic swarm into a single globe. 'Some of the swarmsare,' says Lockyer, 'truly members of the solar system,' and some ofthese travel round the sun in nearly circular orbits, like planets. Theymay be regarded as infinitesimal planets, and so Chamberlain calls them'planetismals.'"The planetismal theory is a development of the meteoritic theory, andpresents it in an especially attractive guise. It regards meteorites asvery sparsely distributed through space, and gravity as powerless tocollect them into dense groups. So it assigns the parentage of the solarsystem to a spiral nebula composed of planetismals, and the planets asformed from knots in the nebula, where many planetismals had beenconcentrated near the intersections of their orbits. These groups ofmeteorites, already as dense as a swarm of bees, were then packed closerby the influence of gravity, and the contracting mass was heated by thepressure, even above the normal melting-point of the material, which waskept rigid by the weight of the overlying layers."Now, adopting this theory as the last word of science upon the subjectof the origin of planets, we see that it affords immense scope fordiversity in results depending on the total _amount_ of matter availablewithin the range of attraction of an incipient planetary mass, and the_rates_ at which this matter becomes available. By a special combinationof these two quantities (which have almost certainly been different foreach planet) I think we may be able to throw some light upon thestructure and physical features of Mars._The Probable Mode of Origin of Mars._This planet, lying between two of much greater mass, has evidently hadless material from which to be formed by aggregation; and if weassume--as in the absence of evidence to the contrary we have a right todo--that its beginnings were not much later (or earlier) than those ofthe earth, then its smaller size shows that it has in all probabilityaggregated very much more slowly. But the internal heat acquired by aplanet while forming in this manner will depend upon the rate at whichit aggregates and the velocity with which the planetismals' fall intoit, and this velocity will increase with its mass and consequent forceof gravity. In the early stages of a planet's growth it will probablyremain cold, the small amount of heat produced by each impact being lostby radiation before the next one occurs; and with a small and slowlyaggregating planet this condition will prevail till it approaches itsfull size. Then only will its gravitative force be sufficient to causeincoming matter to fall upon it with so powerful an impact as to produceintense heat. Further, the compressive force of a small planet will be aless effective heat-producing agency than in the case of a larger one.The earth we know has acquired a large amount of internal heat, probablysufficient to liquefy its whole interior; but Mars has only one-ninthpart the mass of the earth, and it is quite possible, and even probable,that its comparatively small attractive force would never have liquefiedor even permanently heated the more central portions of its mass. Thisbeing admitted, I suggest the following course of events as quitepossible, and not even improbable, in the case of this planet. Duringthe whole of its early growth, and till it acquired nearly its presentdiameter, its rate of aggregation was so slow that the planetismalsfalling upon it, though they might have been heated and even partiallyliquefied by the impact, were never in such quantity as to produce anyconsiderable heating effect on the whole mass, and each local rise oftemperature was soon lost by radiation. The planet thus grew as a solidand cold mass, compacted together by the impact of the incoming matteras well as by its slowly increasing gravitative force. But when it hadattained to within perhaps 100, perhaps 50 miles, or less, of itspresent diameter, a great change occurred in the opportunity for furthergrowth. Some large and dense swarm of meteorites, perhaps containing anumber of bodies of the size of the asteroids, came within the range ofthe sun's attraction and were drawn by it into an orbit which crossedthat of Mars at such a small angle that the planet was able at eachrevolution to capture a considerable number of them. The result mightthen be that, as in the case of the earth, the continuous inpour of thefresh matter first heated, and later on liquefied the greater part of itas well perhaps as a thin layer of the planet's original surface; sothat when in due course the whole of the meteor-swarm had been captured,Mars had acquired its present mass, but would consist of an intenselyheated, and either liquid or plastic thin outer shell resting upon acold and solid interior.The size and position of the two recently discovered satellites of Mars,which are believed to be not more than ten miles in diameter, the moreremote revolving around its primary very little slower than the planetrotates, while the nearer one, which is considerably less distant fromthe planet's surface than its own antipodes and revolves around it morethan three times during the Martian day, may perhaps be looked upon asthe remnants of the great meteor-swarm which completed the Martiandevelopment, and which are perhaps themselves destined at some distantperiod to fall into the planet. Should future astronomers witness thephenomenon the effect produced upon its surface would be full ofinstruction.As the result of such an origin as that suggested, Mars would possess astructure which, in the essential feature of heat-distribution, would bethe very opposite of that which is believed to characterise the earth,yet it might have been produced by a very slight modification of thesame process. This peculiar heat-distribution, together with a muchsmaller mass and gravitative force, would lead to a very differentdevelopment of the surface and an altogether diverse geological historyfrom ours, which has throughout been profoundly influenced by its heatedinterior, its vast supply of water, and the continuous physical andchemical reactions between the interior and the crust.These reactions have, in our case, been of substantially the samenature, and very nearly of the same degree of intensity throughout thewhole vast eons of geological time, and they have resulted in awonderfully complex succession of rock-formations--volcanic, plutonic,and sedimentary--more or less intermingled throughout the whole series,here remaining horizontal as when first deposited, there upheaved ordepressed, fractured or crushed, inclined or contorted; denuded by rainand rivers with the assistance of heat and cold, of frost and ice, in anunceasing series of changes, so that however varied the surface may be,with hill and dale, plains and uplands, mountain ranges and deepintervening valleys, these are as nothing to the diversities of interiorstructure, as exhibited in the sides of every alpine valley orprecipitous escarpment, and made known to us by the work of the minerand the well-borer in every part of the world._Structural Straight Lines on the Earth._The great characteristic of the earth, both on its surface and in itsinterior, is thus seen to be extreme diversity both of form andstructure, and this is further intensified by the varied texture,constitution, hardness, and density of the various rocks and debris ofwhich it is composed. It is therefore not surprising that, with such acomplex outer crust, we should nowhere find examples of thosegeometrical forms and almost world-wide straight lines that give such aremarkable, and as Mr. Lowell maintains, 'non-natural' character to thesurface of Mars, but which, as it seems to me, of themselves afford_prima facie_ evidence of a corresponding simplicity and uniformity inits internal structure.Yet we are not ourselves by any means devoid of 'straight lines'structurally produced, in spite of every obstacle of diversity of formand texture, of softness and hardness, of lamination or crystallisation,which are adverse to such developments. Examples of these are thenumerous 'faults' which occur in the harder rocks, and which oftenextend for great distances in almost perfect straight lines. In our owncountry we have the Tyneside and Craven faults in the North of England,which are 30 miles long and often 20 yards wide; but even more strikingis the great Cleveland Dyke--a wall of volcanic rock dipping slightlytowards the south, but sometimes being almost vertical, and stretchingacross the country, over hill and dale, in an almost perfect straightline from a point on the coast ten miles north of Scarborough, in awest-by-north direction, passing about two miles south of Stockton andterminating about six miles north-by-east of Barnard Castle, a distanceof very nearly 60 miles. The great fault between the Highlands andLowlands of Scotland extends across the country from Stonehaven to nearHelensburgh, a distance of 120 miles; and there are very many more ofless importance.Much more extensive are some of the great continental dislocations,often forming valleys of considerable width and length. The Upper Rhineflows in one of these great valleys of subsidence for about 180 miles,from Mulhausen to Frankfort, in a generally straight line, thoughmodified by denudation. Vaster still is the valley of the Jordan throughthe Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, continued by the Wady Arabah to theGulf of Akaba, believed to form one vast geological depression orfracture extending in a straight line for 400 miles.Thousands of such faults, dykes, or depressions exist in every part ofthe world, all believed to be due to the gradual shrinking of the heatedinterior to which the solid crust has to accommodate itself, and theyare especially interesting and instructive for our present purpose asshowing the tendency of such fractures of solid rock-material to extendto great lengths in straight lines, notwithstanding the extremeirregularity both in the surface contour as well as in the internalstructures of the varied deposits and formations through which theypass._Probable Origin of the Surface-features of Mars._Returning now to Mars, let us consider the probable course of eventsfrom the point at which we left it. The heat produced by impact andcondensation would be likely to release gases which had been incombination with some of the solid matter, or perhaps been itself in asolid state due to intense cold, and these, escaping outwards to thesurface, would produce on a small scale a certain amount of upheaval andvolcanic disturbance; and as an outer crust rapidly formed, a number ofvents might remain as craters or craterlets in a moderate state ofactivity. Owing to the comparatively small force of gravity, the outercrust would become scoriaceous and more or less permeated by the gases,which would continue to escape through it, and this would facilitate thecooling of the whole of the heated outer crust, and allow it to becomerather densely compacted. When the greater portion of the gases had thusescaped to the outer surface and assisted to form a scanty atmosphere,such as now exists, there would be no more internal disturbance and thecooling of the heated outer coating would steadily progress, resultingat last in a slightly heated, and later in a cold layer of moderatethickness and great general uniformity. Owing to the absence of rain andrivers, denudation such as we experience would be unknown, though thesuperficial scoriaceous crust might be partially broken up by expansionand contraction, and suffer a certain amount of atmospheric erosion.The final result of this mode of aggregation would be, that the planetwould consist of an outer layer of moderate thickness as compared withthe central mass, which outer layer would have cooled from a highlyheated state to a temperature considerably below the freezing-point, andthis would have been all the time _contracting upon a previously cold,and therefore non-contracting nucleus._ The result would be that veryearly in the process great superficial tensions would be produced, whichcould only be relieved by cracks or fissures, which would initiate atpoints of weakness--probably at the craterlets already referred to--fromwhich they would radiate in several directions. Each crack thus formednear the surface would, as cooling progressed, develop in length anddepth; and owing to the general uniformity of the material, and possiblysome amount of crystalline structure due to slow and continuous coolingdown to a very low temperature, the cracks would tend to run on instraight lines and to extend vertically downwards, which twocircumstances would necessarily result in their forming portions of'great circles' on the planet's surface--the two great facts which Mr.Lowell appeals to as being especially 'non-natural.'_Symmetry of Basaltic Columns._We have however one quite natural fact on our earth which serves toillustrate one of these two features, the direction of the downwardfissure. This is, the comparatively common phenomenon of basalticcolumns and 'Giant's Causeways.' The wonderful regularity of these, andespecially the not unfrequent upright pillars in serried ranks, as inthe palisades of the Hudson river, must have always impressed observerswith their appearance of artificiality. Yet they are undoubtedly theresult of the very slow cooling and contraction of melted rocks undercompression by strata _below and above them_, so that, when oncesolidified, the mass was held in position and the tension produced bycontraction could only be relieved by numerous very small cracks atshort distances from each other in every direction, resulting in five,six, or seven-sided polygons, with sides only a few inches long. Thiscontraction began of course at the coolest surface, generally the upperone; and observation of these columns in various positions hasestablished the rule that their direction lengthways _is always at rightangles to the cooling surface_, and thus, whenever this surface washorizontal, the columns became almost exactly vertical._How this applies to Mars._One of the features of the surface of Mars that Mr. Lowell describeswith much confidence is, that it is wonderfully uniform and level, whichof course it would be if it had once been in a liquid or plastic state,and not much disturbed since by volcanic or other internal movements.The result would be that cracks formed by contraction of the hardenedouter crust would be vertical; and, in a generally uniform material at avery uniform temperature, these cracks would continue almostindefinitely in straight lines. The hardened and contracting surfacebeing free to move laterally on account of there being a more heated andplastic layer below it, the cracks once initiated above wouldcontinually widen at the surface as they penetrated deeper and deeperinto the slightly heated substratum. Now, as basalt begins to soften atabout 1400 deg. F. and the surface of Mars has cooled to at least thefreezing-point--perhaps very much below it--the contraction would be sogreat that if the fissures produced were 500 miles apart they might bethree miles wide at the surface, and, if only 100 miles apart, thenabout two-thirds of a mile wide.[15] But as the production of thefissures might have occupied perhaps millions of years, a considerableamount of atmospheric denudation would result, however slowly it acted.Expansion and contraction would wear away the edges and sides of thefissures, fill up many of them with the debris, and widen them at thesurfaces to perhaps double their original size.[16][Footnote 15: The coefficient of contraction of basalt is 0.000006 for1 deg. F., which would lead to the results given here.][Footnote 16: Mr. W.H. Pickering observed clouds on Mars 15 miles high;these are the 'projections' seen on the terminator when the planet ispartially illuminated. They were at first thought to be mountains; butduring the opposition of 1894, more than 400 of them were seen atFlagstaff during nine months' observation. Usually they are of rareoccurrence. They are seen to change in form and position from day today, and Mr. Lowell is strongly of opinion that they are dust-storms,not what we term clouds. They were mostly about 13 miles high,indicating considerable aerial disturbance on the planet, and thereforecapable of producing proportional surface denudation.]_Suggested Explanation of the 'Oases.'_The numerous round dots seen upon the 'canals,' and especially at pointsfrom which several canals radiate and where they intersect--termed'oases' by Mr. Lowell and 'craterlets' by Mr. Pickering may be explainedin two ways. Those from which several canals radiate may be true cratersfrom which the gases imprisoned in the heated surface layers havegradually escaped. They would be situated at points of weakness in thecrust, and become centres from which cracks would start duringcontraction. Those dots which occur at the crossing of two straightcanals or cracks may have originated from the fact that at suchintersections there would be four sharply-projecting angles, which,being exposed to the influence of alternate heat and cold (during dayand night) on the two opposite surfaces, would inevitably in time becomefractured and crumbled away, resulting in the formation of a roughlycircular chasm which would become partly filled up by the debris. Thoseformed by cracks radiating from craterlets would also be subject to thesame process of rounding off to an even greater extent; and thus wouldbe produced the 'oases' of various sizes up to 50 miles or more indiameter recorded by Mr. Lowell and other observers._Probable Function of the Great Fissures._Mr. Pickering, as we have seen, supposes that these fissures give outthe gases which, overflowing on each side, favour the growth of thesupposed vegetation which renders the course of the canals visible, andthis no doubt may have been the case during the remote periods whenthese cracks gave access to the heated portions of the surface layer.But it seems more probable that Mars has now cooled down to the almostuniform mean temperature it derives from solar heat, and that thefissures--now for the most part broad shallow valleys--serve merely aschannels along which the liquids and heavy gases derived from themelting of the polar snows naturally flow, and, owing to their nearlylevel surfaces, overflow to a certain distance on each side of them._Suggested Origin of the Blue Patches._These heavy gases, mainly perhaps, as has been often suggested,carbon-dioxide, would, when in large quantity and of considerable depth,reflect a good deal of light, and, being almost inevitably dust-laden,might produce that blue tinge adjacent to the melting snow-caps whichMr. Lowell has erroneously assumed to be itself a proof of the presenceof liquid water. Just as the blue of our sky is undoubtedly due toreflection from the ultra-minute dust particles in our higheratmosphere, similar particles brought down by the 'snow' from the higherMartian atmosphere might produce the blue tinge in the great volumes ofheavy gas produced by its evaporation or liquefaction.It may be noted that Mr. Lowell objects to the carbon-dioxide theory ofthe formation of the snow-caps, that this gas at low pressures does notliquefy, but passes at once from the solid to the gaseous state, andthat only water remains liquid sufficiently long to produce the bluecolour' which plays so large a part in his argument for the mild climateessential for an inhabited planet. But this argument, as I have alreadyshown, is valueless. For only very deep water can possibly show a bluecolour by reflected light, while a dust-laden atmosphere--especiallywith a layer of very dense gas at the bottom of it, as would be the casewith the newly evaporated carbon-dioxide from the diminishing snow-cap--would provide the very conditions likely to produce this blue tinge ofcolour.It may be considered a support to this view that carbonic-acid gasbecomes liquid at--140 deg. F. and solid at--162 deg. F., temperatures farhigher than we should expect to prevail in the polar and north temperateregions of Mars during a considerable part of the year, but such asmight be reached there during the summer solstice when the `snows' sorapidly disappear, to be re-formed a few months later._The Double Canals._The curious phenomena of the 'double canals' are undoubtedly the mostdifficult to explain satisfactorily on any theory that has yet beensuggested. They vary in distance apart from about 100 to 400 miles. Inmany cases they appear perfectly parallel, and Mr. Lowell gives us theimpression that they are almost always so. But his maps show, in somecases, decided differences of width at the two extremities, indicatingconsiderable want of parallelism. A few of the curved canals are alsodouble.There is one drawing in Mr. Lowell's book (p. 219) of the mouths, orstarting points, of the Euphrates and Phison, two widely separateddouble canals diverging at an angle of about 40 deg. from the same twooases, so that the two inner canals cross each other. Now this suggeststwo wide bands of weakness in the planet's crust radiating probably fromwithin the dark tract called the 'Mare Icarium,' and that somewidespread volcanic outburst initiated diverging cracks on either sideof these bands. Something of this kind may have been the cause of mostof the double canals, or they may have been started from two or morecraterlets not far apart, the direction being at first decided by somelocal peculiarity of structure; and where begun continuing in straightlines owing to homogeneity or uniform density of material. This is veryvague, but the phenomena are so remarkable, and so very imperfectlyknown at present, that nothing but suggestion can be attempted._Concluding Remarks on the 'Canals.'_In this somewhat detailed exposition of a possible, and, I hope, aprobable explanation of the surface-features of Mars, I haveendeavoured to be guided by known facts or accepted theories bothastronomical and geological. I think I may claim to have shown thatthere are some analogous features of terrestrial rock-structure toserve as guides towards a natural and intelligible explanation of thestrange geometric markings discovered during the last thirty years, andwhich have raised this planet from comparative obscurity into a positionof the very first rank both in astronomical and popular interest.This wide-spread interest is very largely due to Mr. Lowell's devotionto its study, both in seeking out so admirable a position as regardsaltitude and climate, and in establishing there a first-classobservatory; and also in bringing his discoveries before the public inconnection with a theory so startling as to compel attention. I ventureto think that his merit as one of our first astronomical observers willin no way be diminished by the rejection of his theory, and thesubstitution of one more in accordance with the actually observed facts.APPENDIX._A Suggested Experiment to Illustrate the 'Canals' of Mars._If my explanation of the 'canals' should be substantially correct--thatis, if they were produced by the contraction of a heated outward crustupon a cold, and therefore non-contracting interior, the result of sucha condition might be shown experimentally.Several baked clay balls might be formed to serve as cores, say of 8 to10 inches in diameter. These being fixed within moulds of say half aninch to an inch greater diameter, the outer layer would be formed bypouring in some suitable heated liquid material, and releasing it fromthe mould as soon as consolidation occurs, so that it may cool rapidlyfrom the _outside._ Some kinds of impure glass, or the brittle metalsbismuth or antimony or alloys of these might be used, in order to seewhat form the resulting fractures would take. It would be well to haveseveral duplicates of each ball, and, as soon as tension throughcontraction manifests itself, to try the effect of firing very smallcharges of small shot to ascertain whether such impacts would startradiating fractures. When taken from the moulds, the balls should besuspended in a slight current of air, and kept rotating, to reproducethe planetary condition as nearly as possible.The exact size and material of the cores, the thickness of the heatedouter crust, the material best suited to show fracture by contraction,and the details of their treatment, might be modified in various ways assuggested by the results first obtained. Such a series of experimentswould probably throw further light on the physical conditions which haveproduced the gigantic system of fissures or channels we see upon thesurface of Mars, though it would not, of course, prove that suchconditions actually existed there. In such a speculative matter we canonly be guided by probabilities, based upon whatever evidence isavailable.CHAPTER VIII.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.This little volume has necessarily touched upon a great variety ofsubjects, in order to deal in a tolerably complete manner with the veryextraordinary theories by which Mr. Lowell attempts to explain theunique features of the surface of the planet, which, by long-continuedstudy, he has almost made his own. It may therefore be well to sum upthe main points of the arguments against his view, introducing a fewother facts and considerations which greatly strengthen my argument.The one great feature of Mars which led Mr. Lowell to adopt the view ofits being inhabited by a race of highly intelligent beings, and, withever-increasing discovery to uphold this theory to the present time, isundoubtedly that of the so-called 'canals'--their straightness, theirenormous length, their great abundance, and their extension over theplanet's whole surface from one polar snow-cap to the other. The veryimmensity of this system, and its constant growth and extension duringfifteen years of persistent observation, have so completely takenpossession of his mind, that, after a very hasty glance at analogousfacts and possibilities, he has declared them to be 'non-natural'--therefore to be works of art--therefore to necessitate thepresence of highly intelligent beings who have designed and constructedthem. This idea has coloured or governed all his writings on thesubject. The innumerable difficulties which it raises have been eitherignored, or brushed aside on the flimsiest evidence. As examples, henever even discusses the totally inadequate water-supply for suchworldwide irrigation, or the extreme irrationality of constructing sovast a canal-system the waste from which, by evaporation, when exposedto such desert conditions as he himself describes, would use up tentimes the probable supply.Again, he urges the 'purpose' displayed in these 'canals.' Their being_all_ so straight, _all_ describing great circles of the 'sphere,' allbeing so evidently arranged (as he thinks) either to carry water to some'oasis' 2000 miles away, or to reach some arid region far over theequator in the opposite hemisphere! But he never considers thedifficulties this implies. Everywhere these canals run for thousands ofmiles across waterless deserts, forming a system and indicating apurpose, the wonderful perfection of which he is never tired of dwellingupon (but which I myself can nowhere perceive).Yet he never even attempts to explain how the Martians could have lived_before_ this great system was planned and executed, or why they did not_first_ utilise and render fertile the belt of land adjacent to thelimits of the polar snows--why the method of irrigation did not, as withall human arts, begin gradually, at home, with terraces and channels toirrigate the land close to the source of the water. How, with such adesert as he describes three-fourths of Mars to be, did the inhabitantsever get to _know_ anything of the equatorial regions and its needs, soas to start right away to supply those needs? All this, to my mind, isquite opposed to the idea of their being works of art, and altogether infavour of their being natural features of a globe as peculiar in originand internal structure as it is in its surface-features. The explanationI have given, though of course hypothetical, is founded on knowncosmical and terrestrial facts, and is, I suggest, far more scientificas well as more satisfactory than Mr. Lowell's wholly unsupportedspeculation. This view I have explained in some detail in the precedingchapter.Mr. Lowell never even refers to the important question of loss byevaporation in these enormous open canals, or considers the undoubtedfact that the only intelligent and practical way to convey a limitedquantity of water such great distances would be by a system ofwater-tight and air-tight tubes laid _under the ground._ The mereattempt to use open canals for such a purpose shows complete ignoranceand stupidity in these alleged very superior beings; while it is certainthat, long before half of them were completed their failure to be of anyuse would have led any rational beings to cease constructing them.He also fails to consider the difficulty, that, if these canals arenecessary for existence in Mars, how did the inhabitants ever reach asufficiently large population with surplus food and leisure enablingthem to rise from the low condition of savages to one of civilisation,and ultimately to scientific knowledge? Here again is a dilemma which ishard to overcome. Only a _dense_ population with _ample_ means ofsubsistence could possibly have constructed such gigantic works; but,given these two conditions, no adequate motive existed for theconception and execution of them--even if they were likely to be of anyuse, which I have shown they could not be._Further Considerations on the Climate of Mars._Recurring now to the question of climate, which is all-important, Mr.Lowell never even discusses the essential point--the temperature thatmust _necessarily_ result from an atmospheric envelope one-twelfth (orat most one-seventh) the density of our own; in either casecorresponding to an altitude far greater than that of our highestmountains.[17] Surely this phenomenon, everywhere manifested on theearth even under the equator, of a regular decrease of temperature withaltitude, the only cause of which is a less dense atmosphere, shouldhave been fairly grappled with, and some attempt made to show why itshould not apply to Mars, except the weak remark that on a level surfaceit will not have the same effect as on exposed mountain heights. But it_does_ have the same effect, or very nearly so, on our lofty plateauxoften hundreds of miles in extent, in proportion to their altitude.Quito, at 9350 ft. above the sea, has a mean temperature of about 57 deg.F., giving a lowering of 23 deg. from that of Manaos at the mouth of the RioNegro. This is about a degree for each 400 feet, while the general fallfor isolated mountains is about one degree in 340 feet according toHumboldt, who notes the above difference between the rate of cooling foraltitude of the plains--or more usually sheltered valleys in which thetowns are situated--and the exposed mountain sides. It will be seen thatthis lower rate would bring the temperature of Mars at the equator downto 20 deg. F. below the freezing point of water from this cause alone.[Footnote 17: A four inches barometer is equivalent to a height of40,000 feet above sea-level with us.]But all enquirers have admitted, that if conditions as to atmospherewere the same as on the earth, its greater distance from the sun wouldreduce the temperature to-31 deg. F., equal to 63 deg. below the freezingpoint. It is therefore certain that the combined effect of both causesmust bring the temperature of Mars down to at least 70 deg. or 80 deg.below thefreezing point.The cause of this absolute dependence of terrestrial temperatures upondensity of the air-envelope is seldom discussed in text-books either ofgeography or of physics, and there seems to be still some uncertaintyabout it. Some impute it wholly to the thinner air being unable toabsorb and retain so much heat as that which is more dense; but if thiswere the case the soil at great altitudes not having so much of its heattaken up by the air should be warmer than below, since it undoubtedly_receives_ more heat owing to the greater transparency of the air aboveit; but it certainly does not become warmer. The more correct view seemsto be that the loss of heat by radiation is increased so much throughthe rarity of the air above it as to _more_ than counterbalance theincreased insolation, so that though the surface of the earth at a givenaltitude may receive 10 per cent. more direct sun-heat it loses bydirect radiation, combined with diminished air and cloud-radiation,perhaps 20 or 25 per cent. more, whence there is a resultant coolingeffect of 10 or 15 per cent. This acts by day as well as by night, sothat the greater heat received at high altitudes does not warm the soilso much as a less amount of heat with a denser atmosphere.This effect is further intensified by the fact that a less dense cannotabsorb and transmit so much heat as a more dense atmosphere. Here thenwe have an absolute law of nature to be observed operating everywhere onthe earth, and the mode of action of which is fairly well understood.This law is, that reduced atmospheric pressure increases radiation, orloss of heat, _more rapidly_ than it increases insolation or gain ofheat, so that the result is _always_ a considerable _lowering_ oftemperature. What this lowering is can be seen in the universal fact,that even within the tropics perpetual snow covers the higher mountainsummits, while on the high plains of the Andes, at 15,000 or 16,000 feetaltitude, where there is very little or no snow, travellers are oftenfrozen to death when delayed by storms; yet at this elevation theatmosphere has much more than double the density of that of Mars!The error in Mr. Lowell's argument is, that he claims for the scantyatmosphere of Mars that it allows more sun-heat to reach the surface;but he omits to take account of the enormously increased loss of heat bydirect radiation, as well as by the diminution of air-radiation, whichtogether necessarily produce a great reduction of temperature.It is this great principle of the prepotency of radiation overabsorption with a diminishing atmosphere that explains the excessivelylow temperature of the moon's surface, a fact which also serves toindicate a very low temperature for Mars, as I have shown in Chapter VI.These two independent arguments--from alpine temperatures and from thoseof the moon--support and enforce each other, and afford a conclusiveproof (as against anything advanced by Mr. Lowell) that the temperatureof Mars must be far too low to support animal life.A third independent argument leading to the same result is Dr. JohnstoneStoney's proof that aqueous vapour cannot exist on Mars; and this factMr. Lowell does not attempt to controvert.To put the whole case in the fewest possible words:All physicists are agreed that, owing to the distance of Mars from thesun, it would have a mean temperature of about-35 deg. F. (= 456 deg. F. abs.)even if it had an atmosphere as dense as ours.(2) But the very low temperatures on the earth under the equator, at aheight where the barometer stands at about three times as high as onMars, proves, that from scantiness of atmosphere alone Mars cannotpossibly have a temperature as high as the freezing point of water; andthis proof is supported by Langley's determination of the low _maximum_temperature of the full moon.The combination of these two results must bring down the temperature ofMars to a degree wholly incompatible with the existence of animal life.(3) The quite independent proof that water-vapour cannot exist on Mars,and that therefore, the first essential of organic life--water--isnon-existent.The conclusion from these three independent proofs, which enforce eachother in the multiple ratio of their respective weights, is thereforeirresistible--that animal life, especially in its higher forms, cannotexist on the planet.Mars, therefore, is not only uninhabited by intelligent beings such asMr. Lowell postulates, but is absolutely UNINHABITABLE.End of Project Gutenberg's Is Mars Habitable?, by Alfred Russel Wallace*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK IS MARS HABITABLE? ******** This file should be named 10855.txt or 10855.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/8/5/10855/Produced by Thaadd and the PG Distributed Proofreading TeamUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.

GENEVIEVE   XXX  THE TURNCOAT  XXXI  THE SPECTER IN THE HOUSECHAPTER IA LADY IN COMPANY"Madam, you are charming!  You have not slept, and yet you smile.No man could ask a better prisoner."She turned to him, smiling faintly."I thank you.  At least we have had breakfast, and for such mercy Iam grateful to my jailer.  I admit I was famished.  What now?"With just the turn of a shoulder she indicated the water front,where, at the end of the dock on which they stood, lay the goodship, _Mount Vernon_, river packet, the black smoke already pouringfrom her stacks.  In turn he smiled and also shrugged a shoulder."Let us not ask!  My dear lady, I could journey on for ever withone so young and pleasant as yourself.  I will give you my promisein exchange for your parole."Now her gesture was more positive, her glance flashed more keenlyat him.  "Do not be too rash," she answered.  "My parole runs onlywhile we travel together privately.  As soon as we reach coach orboat, matters will change.  I reserve the right of any prisoner tosecure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  I shallendeavor, believe me--and in my own way."He frowned as she presently went on to make herself yet more clear."It was well enough when we traveled in our own private express,from Washington here to Pittsburgh for then there was no chance forescape.  I gave my parole, because it pleased you and did notjeopardize myself.  Here my jailer may perhaps have some troublewith me.""You speak with the courage and fervor of the true leader of acause.  Madam," he rejoined, now smiling.  "What evil days arethese on which I have fallen--I, a mere soldier obeying orders!Not that I have found the orders unpleasant; but it is not fair ofyou to bring against mankind double weapons!  Such is not the usageof civilized warfare.  Dangerous enough you are as woman alone,without bringing to your aid those gifts of mind suited to problemswhich men have been accustomed to arrogate to themselves.""Arrogate is quite the right word.  It is especially fit for ajailer."This time the shaft went home.  The florid countenance of youngCaptain Carlisle flushed yet ruddier beneath its tan.  His lips setstill more tightly under the scant reddish mustache.  With agesture of impatience he lifted his military hat and passed a handover the auburn hair which flamed above his white forehead.  Hisslim figure stiffened even as his face became more stern.  Clad inthe full regimentals of his rank, he made a not unmanly figure ashe stood there, though hardly taller than this splendid woman whomhe addressed--a woman somewhat reserved, mocking, enigmatic; but,as he had said, charming.  That last word of description had beeneasy for any man who had seen her, with her long-lashed dark eyes,her clear cheek just touched with color, her heavy dark hairimpossible to conceal even under its engulfing bonnet, her whollyexquisite and adequate figure equally unbanished even by the tryingcostume of the day.  She stood erect, easy, young, strong, fit tolive; and that nature had given her confidence in herself wasevidenced now in the carriage of head and body as she walked to andfro, pausing to turn now and then, impatient, uneasy, like somecaged creature, as lithe, as beautiful, as dangerous and aspuzzling in the matter of future conduct.  Even as he removed hiscap, Carlisle turned to her, a man's admiration in his eyes, agentleman's trouble also there.[Illustration: Carlisle turned, a man's admiration in his eyes]"My dear Countess St. Auban," said he, more formally, "I wish thatyou might never use that word with me again,--jailer!  I am onlydoing my duty as a soldier.  The army has offered to it all sortsof unpleasant tasks.  They selected me as agent for yourdisappearance because I am an army officer.  I had no option, Imust obey.  In my profession there is not enough fighting, and toomuch civilian work, police work, constable work, detective work.There are fools often for officers, and over them politicians whoare worse fools, sometimes.  Well, then, why blame a simple fellowlike me for doing what is given him to do?  I have not liked theduty, no matter how much I have enjoyed the experience.  Now, withpuzzles ended and difficulties beginning, you threaten to make myunhappy lot still harder!""Why did you bring me here?""That I do not know.  I could not answer you even did I know.""And why did I come?" she mused, half to herself."Nor can I say that.  Needs must when the devil drives; and HisMajesty surely was on the box and using his whip-hand, two daysago, back in Washington.  Your own sense of fairness will admit asmuch as that."She threw back her head like a restless horse, blooded, mettlesome,and resumed her pacing up and down, her hands now clasped behindher back."When I left the carriage with my maid Jeanne, there," she resumedat length; "when I passed through that dark train shed at midnight,I felt that something was wrong.  When the door of the railwaycoach was opened I felt that conviction grow.  When you met me--thefirst time I ever saw you, sir,--I felt my heart turn cold.""Madam!""And when the door of the coach closed on myself and my maid,--whenwe rolled on away from the city, in spite of all I could do orsay--, why, then, sir, you were my jailer.  Have matters changedsince then?""Madam, from the first you were splendid!  You showed pure courage.'I am a prisoner!' you cried at first--not more than that.  But yousaid it like a lady, a noblewoman.  I admired you then because youfaced me--whom you had never seen before--with no more fear thanhad I been a private and you my commanding officer.""Fear wins nothing.""Precisely.  Then let us not fear what the future may have for us.I have no directions beyond this point,--Pittsburg.  I was to takeboat here, that was all.  I was to convey you out into the West,somewhere, anywhere, no one was to know where.  And someway,anyway, my instructions were, I was to lose you--to lose you.Madam, in plain point of fact.  And now, at the very time I amindiscreet enough to tell you this much, you make my cheerful taskthe more difficult by saying that you must be regarded only as aprisoner of war!"Serene, smiling, enigmatic, she faced him with no fear whatevershowing in her dark eyes.  The clear light of the bright autumnmorning had no terrors for youth and health like hers.  She putback a truant curl from her forehead where it had sought egress tothe world, and looked him full in the face now, drawing a deepbreath which caused the round of her bosom to lift the lace at herthroat.  Then, woman-like, she did the unlocked for, and laughed athim, a low, full ripple of wholesome laughter, which evoked again awave of color to his sensitive face.  Josephine St. Auban was aprisoner,--a prisoner of state, in fact, and such by orders notunderstood by herself, although, as she knew very well, a prisonerwithout due process of law.  Save for this tearful maid who stoodyonder, she was alone, friendless.  Her escape, her safety even,lay in her own hands.  Yet, even now, learning for the first timethis much definitely regarding the mysterious journey into whichshe had been entrapped--even now, a prisoner held fast in somestern and mysterious grasp whose reason and whose nature she couldnot know--she laughed, when she should have wept!"My instructions were to take you out beyond this point," went onCarlisle; "and then I was to lose you, as I have said.  I have hadno definite instructions as to how that should be done, my dearCountess."  His eyes twinkled as he stiffened to his full heightand almost met the level of her own glance."The agent who conveyed my orders to me--he comes from Kentucky,you see--said to me that while I could not bow-string you, it wouldbe quite proper to put you in a sack and throw you overboard.'Only,' said he to me, 'be careful that this sack be tightly tied;and be sure to drop her only where the water is deepest.  And forGod's sake, my dear young man,' he said to me, 'be sure that you donot drop her anywhere along the coast of my own state of Kentucky;for if you do, she will untie the sack and swim ashore into myconstituency, where I have trouble enough without the Countess St.Auban, active abolitionist, to increase it.   Trouble '--said he tome--'thy name is Josephine St.  Auban!'"My dear lady, to that last, I agree.  But, there you have myorders.  You are, as may be seen, close to the throne, so far as wehave thrones in this country.""Then I am safe until we get below the Kentucky shore?" she queriedcalmly."I beg you not to feel disturbed,--" he began."Will you set me down at Louisville?""Madam, I can not.""You have not been hampered with extraordinary orders.  You havejust said, the carte blanche is in your hands.""I have no stricter orders at any time than those I take from myown conscience, Madam.  I must act for your own good as well as forthat of others."Her lip curled now.  "Then not even this country is free!  Evenhere there are secret tribunals.  Even here there are hired bravos.""Ah, Madam, please, not that!  I beg of you--""Excellently kind of you all, to care so tenderly for me--andyourselves!  I, only a woman, living openly, with ill will fornone, paying ray own way, violating no law of the land--""Your words are very bitter, Madam.""The more bitter because they are true.  You will release me thenat Cairo, below?""I can not promise, Madam.  You would be back in Washington by thefirst boats and trains.""So, the plot runs yet further?  Perhaps you do not stop this sidethe outer ways of the Mississippi?  Say, St. Louis, New Orleans?""Perhaps even beyond those points," he rejoined grimly.  "I make nopromises, since you yourself make none.""What are your plans, out there, beyond?""You ask it frankly, and with equal frankness I say I do not know.Indeed, I am not fully advised in all this matter.  It wasimperative to get you out of Washington, and if so, it is equallyimperative to keep you out of Washington.  At least for a time I amobliged to construe my carte blanche in that way, my dear lady.And as I say, my conscience is my strictest officer.""Yes," she said, studying his face calmly with her steady dark eyes.It was a face sensitive, although bony and lined; stern, though itsowner still was young.  She noticed the reddish hair and beard, theflorid skin, the blue eye set deep--a fighting eye, yet that of avisionary."You are a fanatic," she said."That is true.  You, yourself, are of my own kind.  You would killme without tremor, if you had orders, and I--""You would do as much!""You are of my kind, Madam.  Yes; we both take orders from our ownsouls.  And that we think alike in many ways I am already sure.""None the less--""None the less, I can not agree to set you down at Cairo, or at anyintermediate point.  I will only give my promise in return for yourown parole.  That, I would take as quickly as though it were theword of any officer; but you do not give it.""No, I do not.  I am my own mistress.  I am going to escape as soonas I can."He touched his cap in salute.  "Very well, then.  I flatteredmyself we had done well together thus far--you have made it easy.But now--no, no, I will not say it.  I would rather see you defiantthan to have you weaken.  I love courage, and you have it.  Thatwill carry you through.  It will keep you clean and safe as well."Her face clouded for the first time."I have not dared to think of that," she said.  "So long as we camein the special train, with none to molest or make me afraid--afraidwith that fear which a woman must always have--we did well enough,as I have said; but now, here in the open, in public, before theeyes of all, who am I, and who are you to me?  I am not yourmother?""Scarcely, at twenty three or four."  He pursed a judicial lip."Nor your sister?""No."[Illustration:  The _Mount Vernon_]"Nor your wife?""No."  He flushed here, although he answered simply."Nor your assistant in any way?"His face lighted suddenly."Why not?" said he.  "Can't you be my amanuensis,--that sort ofthing, you see?  Come, we must think of this.  This is where myconscience hurts me--I can't bear to have _my_ duty hurt _you_.That, my dear Countess, cuts me to the quick.  You will believethat, won't you?""Yes, I believe that.  Jeanne," she motioned to her maid who stoodapart all this time, "my wrap, please.  I find the air cool.  Whenthe body is weak or worn, my dear sir, the mind is not at its best;and I shall need all my wits.""But you do not regard me as your enemy?""I am forced to do so.  Personally, I thank you; professionally, Imust fight you.  Socially, I must be--what did you say,--youramanuensis?  So!  We are engaged in a great work, a treatise on ourriver fortifications, perhaps?  But since when did army officersafford the luxury of amanuenses in this simple republic?  Does yourVehmgerichte pay such extraordinary expenses?  Does your carteblanche run so far as that also?""You must not use such terms regarding the government of thiscountry," he protested.  "Our administration does not suit me, butit has pleased a majority of our people, else it would not be inpower, and it is no Vehmgerichte, The law of self preservationobtains in this country as with all nations, even in Europe.  Butwe have planned no confiscation of your property, nor threatenedany forfeiture of your life.""No, you have only taken away that which is dearer than anythingelse, that which your government guarantees to every human being inthis country--liberty!""And even that unconstitutional point shall remain such no longerthan I can help, Madam.  Do not make our journey longer by leavingit more difficult.  God knows, I am beset enough even as it is now.But be sure our Vehmgerichte, as you are pleased to call it, shallnever, at least while I am its agent, condemn you to any situationunsuited to a gentlewoman.  A very high compliment has been paidyou in holding you dangerous because of your personal charm.  It istrue, Madam, that is why you were put out of Washington--becauseyou were dangerous.  They thought you could get the ear of anyman--make him divulge secrets which he ought to keep--if you justasked him to do it--for the sake of Josephine St. Auban!"  Hejerked out his sentences, as though habitual reticence and lack ofacquaintance with women left it difficult for him to speak, eventhus boldly."Oh, thank you, thank you!"  She clapped her hands together,mockingly."Before now, women less beautiful than you have robbed men of theirreason, have led them to do things fatal as open treason to theircountry.  These men were older than you or I.   Perhaps, as youwill agree, they were better able to weigh the consequences.  Youare younger than they, younger than I, myself; but you arecharming--and you are young.  Call it cruel of me, if you like, totake you by the hand and lead you gently away from that sort ofdanger for just a few days.  Call me jailer, if you like.  None theless it is my duty, and I shall call it in part a kindness to youto take you away from scenes which might on both sides bedangerous.  Some of the oldest and best minds of this country havefelt--""At least those minds were shrewd in choosing their agent," sherejoined.  "Yes; you are fanatic, that is plain.  You will obeyorders.  And you have not been much used to women.  That makes itharder for me.  Or easier!"  She smiled at him again, very blithefor a prisoner."It ought to have been held down to that," he began disconsolately,"I should have been all along professional only.  It began wellwhen you gave me your parole, so that I need not sit nodding andblinking, over against you also nodding and blinking all nightlong.  Had you been silly, as many women would have been, you couldnot this morning be so fresh and brilliant--even though you tell meyou have not slept, which seems to me incredible.  I myself sleptlike a boy, confident in your word.  Now, you have banished sleep!Nodding and blinking, I must henceforth watch you, nodding--andblinking, unhappy, uncomfortable; whereas, were it in my power, Iwould never have you know the first atom of discomfort.""There, there!  I am but an amanuensis, my dear Captain Carlisle."He colored almost painfully, but showed his own courage.  "I onlyadmire the wisdom of the Vehmgerichte.  They knew you weredangerous, and I know it.  I have no hope, should I become too muchoppressed by lack of sleep, except to follow instructions, and castyou overboard somewhere below Kentucky!""You ask me not to attempt any escape?""Yes.""Why, I would agree to as much as that.  It is, as you say, amatter of indifference to me whether I leave the boat at Cairo orat some point farther westward.  Of course I would return toWashington as soon as I escaped from bondage.""Excellent, Madam!  Now, please add that you will not attempt tocommunicate with any person on the boat or on shore.""No; that I will not agree to as a condition.""Then still you leave it very hard for me."She only smiled at him again, her slow, deliberate smile; yet therewas in it no trace of hardness or sarcasm.  Keen as her mindassuredly was, as she smiled she seemed even younger, perhaps fouror five and twenty at most.  With those little dimples now ripplingfrankly into view at the corners of her mouth, she was almostgirlish in her expression, although the dark eyes above,long-lashed, eloquent, able to speak a thousand tongues into shame,showed better than the small curving lips the well-poised woman ofthe world.Captain Edward Carlisle, soldier as he was, martinet as he was,felt a curious sensation of helplessness seize upon him as he mether, steady gaze, her alluring smile; he could not tell what thisprisoner might do.  He cursed the fate which had assigned such aduty, cursed especially that fate which forced a gallant soldier tomeet so superb a woman as this under handicap so hard.  For almostthe first time since they had met they were upon the point ofawkwardness.  Light speech failed them for the moment, the gravityof the situation began to come home to both of them.  Indeed, whowere they?  What were they to the public under whose notice theymight fall--indeed, must fall?  There was no concealing face andfigure of a woman such as this; no, not in any corner of the world,though she were shrouded in oriental veil.  Nay, were she indeedtied in a sack and flung into the sea, yet would she arise to maketrouble for mankind until her allotted task should be complete!How could they two answer any question which might arise regardingtheir errand, or regarding their relations as they stood, here atthe gateway of the remoter country into which they were departing?How far must their journey together continue?  What would be saidregarding them?Carlisle found it impossible to answer such questions.  She herselfonly made the situation the more difficult with her high-headeddefiance of him.Hesitating, the young officer turned his gaze over the wide dock,now covered with hurrying figures, with massed traffic, with theconfusion preceding the departure of a river boat.  Teamsthundered, carts trundled here and there, shoutings of many minorcaptains arose.  Those who were to take passage on the packethurried forward, to the gangway, so occupied in their own affairsas to have small time to examine their neighbors.  The veryconfusion for the time seemed to afford safety.  Carlisle was uponthe point of drawing a long breath of relief; but even as he turnedto ask his companion to accompany him aboard the boat he caughtsight of an approaching figure which he seemed to recognize.  Hewould have turned away, but the keen-witted woman at his sidefollowed his gaze and paused.  There approached these two now, hatin hand, a gentleman who evidently intended to claim acquaintance.This new-comer was a man who in any company would have seemedstriking.  In complexion fair, and with blue or gray eyes, he wastall as any Viking, as broad in the shoulder.  He was smooth-faced,and his fresh skin and well-developed figure bespoke the man ingood physical condition through active exercise, yet well contentwith the world's apportionment.  His limbs were long, his handsbony and strong.  His air, of self-confident assurance, seemed thatof a man well used to having his own way.  His forehead was highand somewhat rugged.  Indeed, all his features were in large mold,like the man himself, as though he had come from a day when skingarments made the proper garb of men.  As though to keep up thisair of an older age, his long fair hair was cut almost square, lowdown on the neck, as though he were some Frank fresh from theancient forests.  Over the forehead also this square cut wasaffected, so that, as he stood, large and confident, not quite_outre_, scarce eccentric, certainly distinguished in appearance,he had a half-savage look, as though ignorant or scornful of thetenderer ways of civilization.  A leader this man might be, a poorfollower always.Yet the first words he uttered showed the voice and diction of agentleman.  "My dear Captain," he began, extending his hand as heapproached, "I am indeed charmed!  What a delight to see you againin our part of the world!  I must claim the pleasure of having metyou once--two years ago, in St. Louis.  Are you again on your wayto the frontiers?"The tone of inquiry in his voice was just short of curious, indeedmight have been called expectant.  His gaze, admiring yet polite,had not wholly lost opportunity to list the attractions of thislady, whose name had not yet been given him.The gentleman accosted declined to be thus definite; adding only,after the usual felicitations, "Yes, we are going down the river alittle way on the Vernon here.""For some distance?""For quite a distance.""At least, this is not your first journey down our river?""I wish it might be the last.  The railway is opening up a newworld to us.  The stage-coach is a thing of the past.""I wish it might be, for me!" rejoined the stranger."Unfortunately, I am obliged to go West from here over the NationalRoad, to look at some lands I own out in Indiana.  I very muchregret--"There was by this time yet more expectancy in his voice.  He stillbowed, with respectful glances bent upon the lady.  No presentationcame, although in the easy habit of the place and time, suchcourtesy might perhaps have been expected.  Why this stiffnessamong fellow travelers on a little river packet?[Illustration:  He still bowed, with respectful glances.]The tall man was not without a certain grave audacity.  A look ofamusement came to his face as he gazed at the features of theother, now obviously agitated, and not a little flushed."I had not known that your sister--" he began.  His hand thusforced, the other was obliged to reply: "No, the daughter of an oldfriend of mine, you see--we are _en voyage_ together for thewestern country.  It has simply been my fortune to travel incompany with the lady.  I present you, my dear sir, to Miss Barren.My dear Miss Barren, this is State Senator Warville Dunwody, ofMissouri.  We are of opposite camps in politics."The tall man bowed still more deeply.  Meantime, Josephine St.Auban in her own way had taken inventory of the new-comer.  Hercompanion hastily sought to hold matters as they were."My dear Senator Dunwody," he said, "we were just passing down tothe boat to see that the luggage is aboard.  With you, I regretvery much that your journey takes you from us."The sudden consternation which sat upon Dunwody's face was almostamusing.  He was very willing to prolong this conversation.  Intohis soul there had flashed the swift conviction that never in hislife had he seen a woman so beautiful as this.  Yet all he could dowas to smile and bow adieu."A fine man, that Dunwody, yonder," commented the young captain, asthey parted, and as he turned to his prisoner.  "We'll see him onin Washington some day.  He is strengthening his forces now againstMr. Benton out there.  A strong man--a strong one; and a heedless.""Of what party is he?" she inquired, as though casually."What a man's party is in these days," was his answer, "issomething hard to say.  A man like Dunwody is pretty much his ownparty, although the Bentonites call him a 'soft Democrat.'  Hardlysoft he seems, when he gets in action at the state capital ofMissouri yonder.  Certainly Dunwody is for war and tumult.  None ofthis late weak-kneed compromise for him!  To have his own way--thatis Dunwody's creed of life.  I thank God he is not going with usnow.  He might want his own way with you, from the fashion of hisglances.  Did you see?  My word!"  Young Carlisle fumed a shademore than might have seemed necessary for military reasons.Josephine St. Auban turned upon him with her slow smile, composedlylooking at him from between her long, dark lashes."Why do you say that?" she inquired."Because it is the truth.  I don't want him about.""Then you will be disappointed.""Why do you say that?  Did you not hear him say that he was goingWest by coach from here?""You did not give him time.  He is not going West by coach.""What do you mean?""He will be with us on the boat!"CHAPTER IITHE GATEWAY, AND SOME WHO PASSEDWhen Captain Edward Carlisle made casual reference to the"weak-kneed compromise," he simply voiced a personal opinion on atheme which was in the mind of every American, and one regardedwith as many minds as there were men.  That political measure ofthe day was hated by some, admired by others.  This man condemnedit, that cried aloud its righteousness and infallibility; oneargued for it shrewdly, another declaimed against it loudly.  Itwas alike blessed and condemned.  The southern states argued overit, many of the northern states raged at it.  It ruined manypolitical fortunes and made yet other fortunes.  That year was athreshold-time in our history, nor did any see what lay beyond thedoor.If there existed then a day when great men and great measures wereto be born, certainly there lay ready a stage fit for any mightydrama--indeed, commanding it.  It was a young world withal, indeeda world not even yet explored, far less exploited, so far as wereconcerned those vast questions which, in its dumb and blind way,humanity both sides of the sea then was beginning to take up.America scarce more than a half century ago was for the most part aland of query, rather than of hope.Not even in their query were the newer lands of our country thenalike.  We lay in a vast chance-medley, and never had any countrygreater need for care and caution in its councils.  By the grace ofthe immortal gods we had had given into our hands an enormous areaof the earth's richest inheritance, to have and to hold, if thatmight be; but as yet we were not one nation.  We had no unitedthought, no common belief as to what was national wisdom.  Forthree quarters of a century this country had grown; for half acentury it had been divided, one section fighting against anotherin all but arms.  We spoke of America even then as a land of thefree, but it was not free; nor on the other hand was it whollyslave.  Never in the history of the world has there been so great aland, nor one of so diverse systems of government.Before these travelers, for instance, who paused here at the headof the Ohio River, there lay the ancient dividing line between theSouth and the North.  To the northwest, between the Great Lakes andthe Ohio, swept a vast land which, since the days of the oldNorthwest Ordinance of 1787, had by _national_ enactment beendecreed for ever free.  Part of this had the second time beendeclared free, by _state_ law also.  To the eastward of this laycertain states where slavery had been forbidden by the laws of theseveral states, though not by that of the nation.  Again, far outto the West, beyond the great waterway on one of whose arms ourtravelers now stood, lay the vast provinces bought from Napoleon;and of these, all lying north of that compromise line of thirty-sixdegrees, thirty minutes, agreed upon in 1820, had been declared forever free by _national_ law.  Yet beyond this, in the extremenorthwest, lay Oregon, fought through as free soil by virtue of theold Northwest Ordinance, the sleeping dog of slavery being evadedand left to lie when the question of Oregon came up.  Along thePacific, and south of Oregon, lay the new empire of California,bitterly contended over by both sections, but by her ownself-elected _state_ law declared for ever free soil.  Minnesotaand the Dakotas were still unorganized, so there the sleeping dogmight lie, of course.To the south of that river on which our voyagers presently were totake ship, lay a section comprising the southern states, in extentfar larger than all the northern states, and much stronger inlegislative total power in the national halls of Congress.  Hereslavery was maintained by laws of the _states_ themselves.  Thegreat realm of Texas, long coveted by the South, now was joined tothe ranks of the slave-holding states, by virtue of a war ofsomewhat doubtful justice though of undoubted success.  AboveTexas, and below the line of thirty-six degrees, thirty minutes,lay a portion of what was known as the Indian country, where in1820 there had been made no _prohibition_ of slavery by the_national_ government.Above the line of thirty-six degrees, thirty minutes, there thrustup a portion of Texas which had no law at all, nor had it any untila very recent day, being known under the title of "No Man's Land."Yet on to the westward, toward free California, lay a vast butsupposedly valueless region where cotton surely would not grow,that rich country now known as Utah, Nevada, Arizona and NewMexico.  This region, late gained by war from Mexico, soon to beincreased by purchase from Mexico on the South, was still ofindeterminate status, slavery not being prohibited but permitted,by _federal_ action, although most of this territory had been freesoil under the old laws of Mexico.  Moreover, as thoughsardonically to complicate all these much-mingled matters, therethrust up to the northward, out of the permitted slavery region ofthe South, the state of Missouri, quite above the fateful line ofthirty-six degrees, thirty minutes, where slavery was permittedboth by _federal_ and _state_ enactment.Men spoke even then, openly or secretly, of disunion; but in fulltruth, there had as yet been no actual union.  In such confusion,what man could call unwise a halting-time, a compromise?  A countryof tenures so mixed, of theories so diverse, could scarcely havebeen called a land of common government.  It arrogated to itself,over all its dominion, the title of a free republic, yet by its ownmutual covenant of national law, any owner of slaves in thesouthern states might pursue what he called his property across thedividing line, and invoke, in any northern state, the support ofthe state or national officers to assist him in taking back hisslaves.  As a republic we called ourselves even then old andstable.  Yet was ever any country riper for misrule than ours?Forgetting now what is buried, the old arguments all forgot, thatmost bloody and most lamentable war all forgot, could any mind, anyimagination, depict a situation more rife with tumult, more ripefor war than this?  And was it not perforce an issue, of compromiseor war; of compromise, or a union never to be consummated?Yet into this heterogeneous region, from all Europe, itselfconvulsed with revolution, Europe just beginning to awaken to thedoctrine of the rights of humanity, there pressed westward everincreasing thousands of new inhabitants--in that current year overa third of a million, the largest immigration thus far known.  Mostof these immigrants settled in the free country of the North, andas the railways were now so hurriedly crowding westward, it was tobe seen that the ancient strife between North and South must growand not lessen, for these new-comers were bitterly opposed toslavery.  Swiftly the idea national was growing.  The ideademocratic, the idea of an actual self-government--what, now, wasto be its history?North of the fated compromise line, west of the admitted slavestate of Missouri, lay other rich lands ripe for the plow, readyfor Americans who had never paid more than a dollar an acre forland, or for aliens who had never been able to own any land at all.Kansas and Nebraska, names conceived but not yet born,--what wouldthey be?  Would the compromise of this last summer of 1850 hold thebalances of power even?  Could it save this republic, still youngand needy, for yet a time in the cause of peace and growth?  Manydevoutly hoped it.  Many devoutly espoused the cause of compromisemerely for the sake of gaining time.  As neither of the greatpolitical parties of the day filled its ranks from either section,so in both sections there were many who espoused, as many whodenied, the right of men to own slaves.  We speak of slavery as theone great question of that day.  It was not and never has been thegreatest.  The question of democracy--that was even then, and it isnow, the greatest question.Here on the deck of the steamer at the little city of Pittsburg,then gateway of the West, there appeared men of purposes andbeliefs as mixed as this mixed country from which they came.  Somewere pushing out into what now is known as Kansas, others going totake up lands in Missouri.  Some were to pass south to the slavecountry, others north to the free lands; men of all sorts andconditions, many men, of many minds, that was true, and allhurrying into new lands, new problems, new dangers, new remedies.It was a great and splendid day, a great and vital time, thatthreshold-time, when our western traffic increased so rapidly andassuredly that steamers scarcely could be built rapidly enough toaccommodate it, and the young rails leaped westward at a speedbefore then unknown in the world.Carried somehow, somewhither, for some reason, on these surgingfloods, were these travelers, of errand not wholly obvious to theirfellows, yet of such sort as to call into query alike the nature oftheir errand and their own relations.  It is easily earnedrepetition to state that Josephine St. Auban's was a presence notto be concealed.  Even such a boat as the Mount Vernon offered atotal deck space so cramped as to leave secrecy or privacy well outof the question, even had the motley and democratic assemblage ofpassengers been disposed to accord either.  Yet there was somethingin the appearance of this young woman and her companion whichcaused all the heterogeneous groups of humanity to make way forthem, as presently they approached the gang-plank.Apparently they were not unexpected.  The ship's clerks readily ledthe way to apartments which had been secured in advance.  Havingseen to the luggage of his charges, whom he disposed in a gooddouble state-room, the leader of the party repaired to his ownquarters.  Tarrying no longer than to see his own luggage safeaboard, he commanded one of the men to fetch him to the office ofthe captain.The latter gentleman, busy and important, dropped much of hisofficial way when he found whom he was accosting.  "This is quiteunexpected, sir," he began, removing his cap and bowing."Captain Rogers," began the other, "you have been advised to someextent of my plans by telegram from Washington."The captain hesitated.  "Is this with the lady's consent?  I mustconsider the question of damages.""There will be no damages.  Your owners will be quite safe, and sowill you.""Are there any charges of any kind against----?""That is not for you to ask.  She is under my care, and must notdisembark until I say the word.  You will kindly give her a placeat my table.  There must be no idle curiosity to annoy her.  Buttell me, when shall we reach the mouth of the river? Is it notpossible to save some time by avoiding some of the smaller stops?""But our freight, our passengers--"  The captain passed a handacross his brow, much perplexed.  The other showed a suddenfirmness."My errand demands secrecy and speed alike.  There must be nocommunication between this boat and the shore, so far as this younglady is concerned.  Meantime, if all is ready, it would please memightily if we could start."The captain pulled a bell rope.  "Tell the mate to cast off," hesaid, to the man who answered.  An instant later the hoarse boom ofthe boat's whistles roared out their warning.  There came a crushof late-comers at the gangway.  Shouts arose; deck hands scrambledwith the last packages of freight; but presently the staging wasshipped and all the lines cast free.  Churning the stained watersinto foam with her great paddles, the _Mount Vernon_ swung slowlyout into the narrow stream.[Illustration:  The Captain pulled a bell rope.]"Now, Captain Rogers," went on Captain Carlisle, tersely, "tell, mewho's aboard;" and presently he began to ponder the names which, inloose fashion, the clerk assembled from his memory and his personalacquaintance."Hm, Hm!" commented the listener, "very few whom I know.  JudgeClayton from the other side, below Cairo.  State Senator Jones,from Belmont--""You know Mr. Jones?  Old 'Decline and Fall' Jones?  He never readsany book excepting Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_.Always declines a drink when offered, but he's sure to fall amoment later!"  Thus the smiling clerk."Well, I may see Mr. Jones, possibly Judge Clayton.  There's no oneelse."  He seemed not dissatisfied.Alas! for human calculations and for human hopes!  Even as he leftthe captain's room to ascend the stair, he met face to face thevery man whose presence he least desired."Dunwody!" he exclaimed.The gentleman thus addressed extended a hand.  "I see you are safeaboard.  Myself, too, I am very glad.""I thought you said you were going--""I was, but I changed my mind at the last moment.  It is far morecomfortable going down by boat than it is by stage.  Then, thethought of the pleasure of your society on the journey--"  He wassmiling, rather maliciously."Yes, yes, of course!" somewhat dismally."But now, to be frank with you, you don't seem altogether happy.Why do you want to be rid of me?  What harm have I done?" smiledDunwody."Oh, my dear sir!""May not one change his mind if he likes?""My dear sir, there is no argument about that.""Certainly not!  The only argument is on the previousquestion--When are you going to introduce me as you should, to thatextremely beautiful young lady who is with you?""Good God, my very dear sir!""You are not 'my dear sir' at all, so long as you try to hoodwinkme," persisted Dunwody, still smiling.  "Come, now, what are youdoing here, west bound with a young and charming person who is notyour wife, widow, mother, daughter, _fiancee_ or sister--who isnot--""That will do, if you please!" Carlisle's hot temper named into hisfreckled face."Why so touchy?""It is within a man's rights to choose his own company and his ownways.  I am not accountable, except as I choose."The other man was studying him closely, noting his flush, hisirritation, his uneasiness.  "But what I am saying now is that itis cruel, unusual, inhuman and unconstitutional to be so selfishabout it.  Come, I shall only relent when you have shown yourselfmore kind.  For instance, in the matter of her table in thedining-room--""The lady has expressed a desire to remain quite alone, my dearsir.  I must bow to her will.  It is her privilege to come and goas she likes.""She may come and go as she likes?" queried Dunwody, still smiling.There was a look on his face which caused Carlisle suddenly to turnand examine him sharply."Naturally.""Without your consent, even?""Absolutely so.""Then why should she have sent me this little message?" demandedDunwody suddenly.  He presented a folded bit of paper, snapping iton the back with a finger.A still deeper flush spread over the young officer's telltale face.He opened and read: "If you care to aid a woman who is in trouble,come to me at room 19 when you can.""When did you receive this?" he demanded.  "By God!" he added, tohimself, "she did it, too!""Within the moment.  Her maid brought it.""You didn't have this before you came on board--but of course, thatwasn't possible."Dunwody looked at him keenly.  "You have just heard me," he said."No, I don't deny there are some things here which I can'tunderstand.  You are covering up something, my dear Captain, ofcourse, but just what I do not know.  Your station in life, yourpresence in this country, so far from home!--" He smiled now in away which his antagonist considered sinister.  Yet what defensecould be made without exposing secrets which were not his touncover?"Come," went on Dunwody, "let's be frank about it.  You may trustme, of course.  But--neither sister, wife, nor servant--could youblame any man, especially any man who had a direct message likethis, for wanting, or, say, even demanding a meeting?  Haven't Ithe right?  Come, now!"Carlisle made no immediate answer, and was about to turn on hisheel, finding it hard to restrain himself.  He paused, however."Very good, then.  To show how little you know me, and how much youwrong both this lady and myself, you shall meet her, as you say.Not that you have earned the right."CHAPTER IIITHE QUESTIONThe _Mount Vernon_, favored by a good stage of water, soon clearedthe narrow Monongahela channel, passed the confluence, and headeddown under full steam, all things promising well for a speedy andpleasant run.  The sky was blue and cloudless, and the air freshwith the tang of coming autumn.  Especially beautiful were theshores which they now were skirting.  The hues of autumn had beenshaken down over mile after mile of wide forest which appeared in apanorama of russet and gold and red, to grow the more resplendentwhen they should arrive opposite the high bluffs which line thestream almost to the town of Wheeling.Below these upper reaches, then the least settled and wildestportion of the country along the Ohio, the river flattened andwidened, the current becoming more gentle, and the shores, thoughnot yet wholly cleared of their forests, presenting here and therescenes of rural rather than of savage beauty.  Civilization had notas yet taken full hold along this rich valley.  The old town ofMarietta, the cities of Louisville and Cincinnati, the villageshuddled at mouths of such rivers as came down from the Virginiahills, or the larger settlements marking points near thedebouchments of slower streams like the Muskingum and Wabash, whichcrossed the flatter lands beyond, made the chief points of trafficand of interest in those days of west bound travel.On the upper deck or along the rails of the lower deck, manypassengers were gazing out at the varying pictures of the passingshores.  Not so the young officer, erstwhile accosted as jailer ofa woman, later hinted to be something else than jailer.  With eyescast down, he spent most of his time pacing up and down alone.  Yetit was not an irresolute soul which reposed beneath the half-frigidexterior.  He presently arrived upon a plan of action.The public, too, had its rights, he concluded, and the woman as awoman had her rights also to her good fame.  He must not harm hername.  Best then, to disarm suspicion by playing the game wholly inthe open.  The midday meal now being announced by loud proclamationof the boat's gong, he turned, and soon rapped at the door of roomnineteen.Jeanne, the tearful but faithful maid who shared her mistress'fortunes, by this time had done what she could to mend her lady'sappearance.  The traces of travel had been quite removed, by virtueof the contents of such valises as they had with them.  Good healthand youth, as well as good courage, fought for Josephine St. Auban,as well as good sense and a philosophy of travel learned byexperiences in other lands.  If indeed she had not slept, at leasther face did not betray that fact.  Her color was good, her eye wasclear.  Her dark hair, brushed low over the temples in the fashionof the day, was fresh and glossy.  Moreover, her habiliments weresuch as to cause most of the feminine occupants of the boat to makecareful note, when she had accepted Carlisle's escort and enteredthe dining-room.  She walked with calmness to the table reservedfor her, and with inclination of the head thanked him as hearranged her chair for her.  Thus in a way the gauntlet was by boththrown down to all present.Most of those present without hesitation showed their interest.The hum of the dingy tables slackened and ceased.  A score of womenfrowned at a score of men whose glances wandered undutifully.  Whowas she, and what?  That question certainly passed in the minds ofmost in the crowded little room.  Meantime, Josephine St. Auban'sown eyes were not unregardful."I see that my guess was quite correct," she said at length,smiling full at her guardian.At once he caught her thought.  "Oh, about Mr. Dunwody," heassented, assuming a carelessness which she read through at once."Yes, I met him--a while ago.  He told me he had suddenly decidedto change his plans and take the Vernon down the river, instead ofgoing by stage.  Very natural of him, too, I should say.  I wouldbe much distressed to think of myself traveling by coach, even inweather pleasant as this.  He has keen eyes, though, has he not?"he added resentfully."That is to say--""So hard hit that he threatens a duel or worse if I do not at oncefurther his desire to pursue his acquaintance.  It's not myselfhe's so eager to meet.  He has no love for me, that's sure, longago.""Indeed?"  She kept her eyes fixed on her plate.  If a slight flushtinged her cheek it scarce was visible.  "Is that all?" she askedat length."Madam, you yourself could best answer your own question."  Helooked at her keenly, not showing his case; not telling her thatDunwody had shown him her hasty note.  Not the flicker of aneyelash betrayed her own thought.  Surely, she had courage.Surely, she meant trouble."How delightful!" she resumed at length calmly.  "Not that I wearyof your company, sir; but I told you my parole was ended when wereached the boat.  Suppose, now, I should stand up here and cry outthat I am being restrained of my liberty.  What would be theresult?""I should be hung at the yard-arm instantly!  I should be lynched.Dunwody would come in the lead, crashing over the tables.  I fearDunwody, even bearing a rope, as we used to say--in Virgil, was it?""Admirable! Now, since that is true, suppose you and I make somesort of terms!  I'm tired of being jailed, even in a travelingjail.  I told you fairly I should try to escape; and so I shall."He needed no second look to catch the resolution in her glance."Our game is somewhat desperate, Madam, I admit," said he, "Iscarcely know whether you are in my hands or I in yours.  As I havealready given you consideration, let us hope you will do as muchfor me, remembering at least the delicacy of my position.  I'munder orders; and I'm responsible for you.""Yes?" she rejoined.  "Now, as to what I suggest, it is this: Youshall leave the boat at Louisville or Cincinnati.  Your errand isalready sufficiently well done.  You have got me out of Washington.Suppose we set Cincinnati as the last point of our common journey?""But what then for you.  Madam?""As to that, I can not tell.  Why should you care?  Do not beconcerned over details.  You have brought me into this situation.I must escape from it in my own way.""You sting me deeply.  I've had to do this, just as an executionermay have to cut off a head; but a thousand times I ask your pardon.A thousand times you, yourself, have made me ashamed.  Come, whenwe part, shall it not be as friends?  You have won my respect, myadmiration.  I wish I were entitled to your own.  You've beenperfect.  You've been splendid.""Look," she said, without raising her eyelids.He turned.  Dunwody was making his way toward them among the tables."My dear Senator," said Carlisle, choking down his wrath as theMissourian reached them and bowed his salutations, "I have thegreatest pleasure in the world in keeping my promise to you.  I amdelighted to have you join our little party at this time.  Youremember the Countess--I would say, Miss Barren?""I have not so soon forgotten," answered Dunwody.  His commandingeyes still sought her face.  Beyond a slight bow and one upwardglance, she did not display interest; yet in truth a sudden shiverof apprehension came into her heart.  This was a different sort ofman she now must endeavor to handle.  What was it that his straightglance meant?It was a singular situation in which these three found themselves.That she had asked the aid of this new-comer was a fact known toall three of them.  Yet of the three, none knew precisely theextent of the others' knowledge.  Dunwody at least was polite, ifinsistent, in his wish to learn more of this mysterious young womanwho had appealed to him for aid, yet who now made no further sign.Who was she?  What _sort_ was she? he demanded of himself.  God! ifshe was one sort.  And why should she _not_ be that sort?  Did notthe River carry many sorts?  Was not the army ever gallant?  Whatofficer ever hesitated in case of a fair damsel?  And what fairdamsel was not fair game in the open contest among men--that old,old, oldest and keenest of all contests since this hoary worldbegan?"I am sure the fatigue of the journey across the mountains musthave left you quite weary," he ventured, addressing her.  "There'sonly the choice of sleeping, or of hanging over the deck rail andlooking at these hills."  He waved a hand toward a window, whencemight be seen the near-by shores.Josephine St. Auban showed no sign of perturbation as she answered:"Not so weary as busy.  The duties of an amanuensis leave one smalltime for recreation."  Her face was demureness itself.[Illustration: Josephine showed no sign of perturbation.]The situation assumed swift complications.  Carlisle caught hiscue, with alertness fairly to be called brilliant.  "Yes," said he,"the young lady is of foreign education and family, and is mostskilful in these respects.  I should find it difficult to carryforward my literary work without her able assistance.  It is a boonwhich even few public men have shared with myself.  You know, I amin the West in view of certain writings."  He virtuously sat erect,with a fine air, presently pushing back his chair.Dunwody looked from one to the other in perplexity.  He hadexpected to find a woman claiming his aid, or rather hisacquaintance under excuse of a plea for aid.  He found both theseapparently in league against him, and one of these apparently afterall not what he had thought!  His face flushed.  Meantime JosephineSt. Auban arose, bowed, and left them.When the two men found themselves alone, Dunwody, for a time lostin moody silence, at length broke out into a peal of laughter."Well, human nature is human nature, I suppose.  I make no comment,further than to say that I consider all the lady's fears weregroundless.  She has been well treated.  There was no need to callfor _my_ aid.  The army is hard to defeat, Captain, and always was!""I had not myself regarded any officer in the light of an oppressorof the distressed amanuensis," he went on.  "But come now, who isshe?  You started to call her 'Countess.'  Since when havecountesses gone into secretarying?  Tut!  Tut! and again, my dearman, Tut!""Sir," replied Carlisle, "I recall that when I was a youth, some ofus, members of the Sabbath-school class, occasionally would ask ourteacher a question on the Scriptures which he could not answer.  Inthat case he always said, 'My dear young friends, there are somethings which are not for man to know.'""I accept my temporary defeat," said Dunwody slowly.  "We'll see.But come, now, Captain, time is passing and the tables are yearningfor trouble.  The army is distinguished not alone in love.Draw-poker hath its victories, not less than war.  I told Jones andJudge Clayton and one or two others that I was pining for a littlegame of draw.  What do you say?  Should not all lesser questions beplaced in abeyance?""That," said the other, "comes to me at the present moment in thenature of an excellent compromise measure.  I am agreed!"Fencing thus, neither sure of his adversary, they now made theirway to one of the larger saloons, which ordinarily was devoted tothose who preferred to smoke, mayhap to chew, perhaps even to doworse; for the door leading to the bar-room of the boat was near athand.  A darky boy stood grinning, arranging a table, offeringcards and tobacco in a tempting tray.  The two drew up leisurely tothe table, and presently were joined by the gentlemen whom Dunwodyhad mentioned.  For the time, then, as two of the four reflected,there was a truce, a compromise.CHAPTER IVTHE GAMEThey made a group not uninteresting as they gathered about thetable in the deck saloon.  The youngest of the four received thedeference generally accorded the uniform he wore, and returned theregard due age and station in the civilian world.  For the momentrid of one annoying question, he was quite his better self, andadded his quota in the preliminary badinage of the game.  Acrossthe table from him sat Judge Henry Clayton of New Madrid, a talland slender gentleman with silky white mustaches and imperial,gentle of speech, kindly of countenance, and with soft, whitehands, whose long fingers now idly raised and let fall some of theparti-colored tokens of the game.[Illustration: They made a group not uninteresting.]At Clayton's side, Dunwody, younger, larger and more powerful, madesomething of a contrast.  Both these gentlemen had removed theircoats and hung them across the backs of chairs, evidently intendinga serious session.  In this procedure the last of the party nowfollowed suit,--the Honorable William Jones, state senator fromBelmont, Missouri.  Seating himself, the latter now in turn beganshuffling a pack between fingers short, puffy, freckled andexperienced.  His stooped shoulders thrust forward a beardlessround face, whose permanently arched eyebrows seemed to ask acontinuous question, his short, dark hair receded from a highforehead, and a thick mid-body betokened alike middle age and easyliving.  A planter of the back country, and a politician, hiscapital was a certain native shrewdness and little else.  Ofcourse, in company such as this, and at such a day, theconversation must drift toward the ever fruitful topic of slavery."No, sir," began the Honorable William Jones, indulging himself inthe luxury of tobacco as he addressed his companions, "there ain'tno doubt about it.  Us Southerners orto take all that new countrywest of the Missoury, clean acrost to the Pacific."The older gentleman smiled at him.  "You forget California," saidhe.  "She is already in, and free by her own vote.""An' a crime aginst the natural rights of the South!  Sir, theinstitution of slavery is as old as history.  It is as old as thefirst settlement of agricultural man upon one piece of ground.It's as old as the idea of sovereignty itself."Dunwody gave a sly wink at his neighbor, Judge Clayton.  The lattersank back in his chair resigned.  Indeed, he proceeded toprecipitate what he knew was to come."Sir, England herself," he assented gravely, "is the oldest ofslavers.  The Saxons, of whom we speak as the fathers of freedom,were the worst slave masters in the world--they sold their very kininto slavery at times."The Honorable William Jones was impatient of interruption.  "Comin'to our own side of the sea, gentlemen, what do we find?  NewEngland foremost in the slave trade!  New York, ownin' onct moreslaves than Virginny ever did!  Georgia was fo'ced to take on slavelabor, although she had tried to do without it.  _Every_ race,_every_ nation, sirs, has accepted the theory of slave labor.  Whatsays Mr.  Gibbon in his great work--in his remarkable work, histreasure house of learnin'--_The Decline and Fall of the RomanEmpire_--if I had my copy here I could put my finger on to the veryplace where he says it, sirs.  Why, sirs, in the _Decline andFall_--I could show you the very line and chapter if I had my copyhere--but it's up in my room--I could show you the very chapter onslavery, by the Lord Harry! sir, where Mr.  Foote, of the state ofMississippi, in his last speech down in that country, sirs,--""Now, now, Jones," Dunwody raised a restraining hand at length,"just sit down.  Don't go get your copy of the _Decline and Fall_.We're willing to take some of that for granted.  Let's get at thepleasant task of taking away all the money of this Free Soilgentleman from the North.  _Non_ politics, _non_ religion, _sed_poker!  That's why we're here."The Honorable William Jones, his eloquence thus dammed up, seemedto experience a sudden restriction of the throat, and coughed onceor twice.  "I will go against the said poker just onct," said he;"but, ahem!""I would suggest," said Dunwody, "that before we tempt the gods offortune we should first pour a libation for their favor.  What doyou say, sir?"  He turned to Jones and winked at Clayton."No, no, no, sir!  No, I thank you just as much, but I never drinkmore than onct in a day.  At home it varies.  On some days
