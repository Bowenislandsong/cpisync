alls of the house, the massive stone wall builtacross the cellar to mask the secret chamber, the elaborate electricfurnace, the huge hydraulic press, the workbench and tools, the powerfularc light pendent from the ceiling--half an eye would have convincedNick that he occupied the workroom of that master craftsman whosechemical knowledge and inventive genius had given birth to a mostmarvelous production, long, earnestly, yet vainly, sought by others--The production of an artificial diamond!Not until Nick heard the stone door forcibly closed, and its iron boltsshot violently into their sockets, did he pay serious attention toCervera, the venomous Spanish vixen left to guard him.Then, as she swung round toward him, he took a sharper look at herdarkly magnificent face, and was thrilled despite him by theextraordinary changes it had undergone.It had lost its beauty. Its olive flush had given place to a chalkywhiteness. The radiance of her eyes had become a merciless glitter, likethe glint cast from the eyes of a serpent. The reflection of a consumingpassion for vengeance had transfigured her countenance, till it hadbecome like the face of a fiend.Though Nick saw at a glance that his situation had taken on anunexpected and desperate phase, he suppressed any betrayal of it. He metthe woman eye to eye, while she briefly paused and faced him, with acruel smile curling her gray lips."So I have you now, Nick Carter," she cried, with mocking significance."Well, yes, in a way," admitted Nick, coolly."I have you in my power," hissed Cervera, with a vicious display ofsatisfaction."Ah! that's different," said Nick."How different?""That you have me in your power remains to be demonstrated.""Are we not alone here, you fool?""Yes, very much alone.""And you helpless?""Apparently.""If I wish, Nick Carter, I can kill you.""Then pray don't wish it," said Nick. "I am still too young to beheartlessly slain, even by so beautiful and accomplished a woman.""_Caramba!_ you mock me!" cried Cervera, darting toward him with eyesablaze and her lithe figure quivering with passion. "You mock me!--youshall repent it! Perdition! you shall repent it!""Is that so?""You shall repent it, I say!""In this world, or in the next?" inquired Nick, bent upon prolonging thescene as much as possible, with a hope that Chick might suddenly turnup.Cervera did not answer him immediately. She wheeled again and darted tothe door, once more to make sure that she had secured its bolts.She was clad in the black dress in which she had escaped from Nick theprevious night, the somber hue of which was relieved only by occasionalflashes of her dainty white lace underskirts, as she swept quickly fromplace to place, with her lithe figure crouching at times, and her everymovement as swift and impulsive as that of a startled leopard.As he sat watching her, Nick was reminded of her matchless work uponthe stage, thrilling men and women alike with her wild grace and thefiery passion of her indescribable dances.She returned to confront him after a moment, crouching before him, withher glowing eyes fixed on his."In the next world--not in this!" she now replied, with a voice that cutthe air like the snap of a whip. "You'd have brief time for repentancein this.""So you've decided to do the job, have you?" Nick coolly demanded."Yes.""Well, I'm sorry to hear it.""Here is where we even up accounts.""Even them up, eh?""You heard what I said.""But I wasn't aware that I have so very much the best of you.""You have.""How so?""_Caramba!_ you know too much!""Ah! you mean about that girl.""Yes.""I see," nodded Nick, secretly working in vain to loose the ropesconfining his arms. "Well, senora, as a matter of fact, I am ratherlikely to make things unpleasant for you one of these days.""It will be this day, or never. You'll not live to see another.""Possibly not.""_Caramba!_ do you doubt it?"She darted nearer to him, with her hand tearing open the waist of herdress, and then the gleam of a poniard met Nick's gaze. She swept itbefore his eyes with a wild gesture, and gave vent to a mocking laugh."Do you doubt that I can slay you?""Not at all," answered Nick. "It's very evident.""Or that I will?""That appears equally manifest.""So it is!" hissed Cervera, with vicious intensity. "I intend to do it!Do you hear, Nick Carter? I intend to do it!""Oh, yes, I hear you.""Why don't you shrink? Why don't you plead for mercy?""What's the use?"She answered him with a laugh that made the room ring."Besides," added Nick, "it's not my style to show the white feather.""We'll see! _Caramba!_ we will see!"She came nearer to him, crouching before him, so near that her breathfell hot upon his cheeks. Then, with a quick movement, she pressed thepoint of the blade through his clothing, till it pricked the flesh abovehis heart.With his arms bound, with his ankles secured to the legs of the chair,Nick appeared utterly at her mercy--of which she had none.Despite himself, Nick shrank slightly from the wound, and for the firsttime shuddered at the peril by which he was menaced, and from whichthere seemed to be no avenue of escape.Cervera laughed again, a laugh freighted with the terrible ring ofmadness."Did it hurt you?" she screamed, with her glittering eyes raised tosearch his. "Perdition! I hope so! You have tortured me with a thousandfears. I'd like to repay you with a thousand pangs!"Nick's eyes took on an ugly gleam."Why don't you do so, then?" he growled."I would, if I had the time," cried Cervera, through her teeth."You have all there is.""Ten thousand times I'd thrust it into you--thus! thus!"Nick set his jaws and met the blade without flinching.Twice the vicious demon thrust it through his clothing, and now twocrimson stains of blood on his shirt front followed the withdrawal ofthe weapon."See! see!" screamed Cervera, triumphantly, with her terrible faceupturned to his gaze. "You're beginning to bleed! Did you know that thesight of blood affects me as it does a leopard? I thirst for more--ifthat of one I hate! When next I strike you, I shall strike deeper!"That she fully intended to murder him, Nick now, had not a doubt. Thehomicidal madness was in her eyes, in her every feature, her everymotion, and it rang in every word that fell from her bloodless lips.Yet the inflexible nerve of the detective did not for a moment deserthim."Send the blade home at once, if you like," he said, with a scornfulfrown."Not yet--not yet!" she cried, shrilly. "There'll be time for that.""Time and to spare," sneered Nick."I first wish to torture you, as you've tortured me!""Go ahead, then.""Once more! Are you ready?""Let it come."Again she drew back the glittering blade, only to mock him with severalpretended thrusts, hoping thus to create and prolong an agony of fearand suspense.A more viciously cruel and vindictive creature never drew the breath oflife.She laughed again, and slowly pressed the weapon closer--and then, witha sudden startled cry, she drew back and leaped to her feet.A noise like that of a mighty cannonade seemed to shake even the solidwalls of this buried chamber.It was the crash of thunder in the heavens overhead.It was Cervera's first intimation of the terrible tempest that had beengathering outside.At first she thought the sound was that of revolvers, and she darted tothe door and listened, pressing her ear to the wall.The instant her back was turned, Nick made a desperate attempt to freehimself, straining cords and muscles under the determined effort. Itproved vain, however. The ropes held him as if made of twisted steel.Yet in his brief but desperate struggle his right arm came in contactwith an object in the side pocket of his sack coat.The object was a box nearly filled with parlor matches--one of the mostdangerous and treacherous creations of man's inventive genius.Like a sudden revelation, or a bolt out of the blue, there leaped up inNick's mind a possible way of escape.He thought of Cervera's garments, of the fluffy lace skirts beneath hergown, to which a single flash of fire would instantly prove fatal.The resort to such means seemed horrible--yet Nick well knew it was theone and only resource left him.He glanced sharply at Cervera. She was still listening at the door, withher evil face a picture of intense suspense.With a quick turn of his wrist, Nick succeeded in extracting the boxfrom his pocket. Then he forced it open, and with a move of his hand hescattered its entire contents over the floor around his chair. The tinymatches fell with scarce a sound, and Cervera, ten feet away, failed tohear them.Then Nick quietly worked his chair back a foot or two, in order to bringsome of the fateful things upon the floor directly in front of him.A moment later Cervera turned from the door."Thunder--it was thunder," she muttered, under her breath. "There's astorm outside.""Somebody coming?" queried Nick, with taunting accents.He now aimed to provoke her, to force the situation to a climax, lestany mischance should have befallen Chick, or perverted in any way hisown designs upon Kilgore and the gang. His taunting remark provedeffective, moreover.With a snarl of rage Cervera darted toward him, with eyes for him alone,never for the floor."You dog!" she cried, through her white teeth."Do you mock me again?""Oh! no, of course not," sneered Nick."You lie! You do! You think some one will come--that you will thenescape me," screamed Cervera, quivering through and through withvenomous passion.Nick watched her as a cat watches a mouse.Her face was ghastly and distorted, her breast heaving, her every nervequivering, and her eyes were like balls of fire under their knittedbrows.Still clutching the poniard, her jeweled fingers worked convulsivelyaround its haft, like those of one who fain would strike a death blow,yet whose hand was briefly held by consuming horror.Suddenly she darted nearer, with a vicious snarl."You think you'll escape me," she screamed, with bitter ferocity. "Itshows in your eyes. I'll make sure that you don't. Let come who may, youshall be found--dead! Dead!--do you hear?""Oh! yes, I hear.""Yet you do not fear? We'll see--we'll see!"She darted closer to him, with the weapon raised, above her head, andher knee touched Nick's knee. He swung quickly around toward her, andscraped his feet over the floor below her skirts.Then came a quick, furious snapping, like the noise of a miniaturefusillade. A score of the matches had been ignited by Nick's swift move.Almost instantly a shriek of terror broke from Cervera's lips, and shereeled back, clutching wildly at her skirts."My God! I'm on fire!--on fire!" she screamed, with a voice so intensein its agony as to have chilled a man of stone.A roar came from Nick as he sighted the flames under her gown."Release me! Release me!" he thundered, furiously, with a voice thatdrowned her frightful screams. "Cut me loose--loose! It's your onlyhope--your only hope!"She heard him like one in a nightmare of agony and terror, and herinstinct rather than her reason responded to his thundering commands.Still with the poniard in her jeweled hand, still shrieking wildly, sheleaped to his side, and with a single sweep of the keen weapon severedthe rope binding his arms.Then Nick snatched the poniard from her hand. With several swift cutsand slashes he released his limbs, and sprang quickly to his feet.He had already shaped his course. He had observed on the sulphurbarrels, near the wall, a strip of matting, used as a cover for them.Nick snatched it from the barrels, and rushed to wrap it around theskirts and limbs of the terror-stricken woman.For several moments the result seemed doubtful, so doubtful that Nickfinally threw Cervera heavily to the floor, the better to press thematting closely around her and so smother the flames. In this hepresently succeeded, but not before she was so severely burned as to berendered utterly helpless.When Nick arose to his feet Cervera remained lying prostrate on thefloor, moaning with pain, yet in a state of semi-consciousness only. Aglance told Nick that she could make no move to escape, and he now hadother work than that of looking to her comfort.He ran to the stone door, threw the bolts, and quickly dragged it open.Even as he did so, from out of the gloom of the adjoining cellar, a mancame into view, as if suddenly arisen from the ground.The man was Dave Kilgore.CHAPTER XXII.THE LAST TRICK."Carter!""Kilgore!"Each man uttered the name of the other, as if with the same breath. Themeeting came so suddenly that, for the bare fraction of a second, bothmen were nonplused.Then both whipped out a weapon.Crack!Bang!They fired together, and both missed, Nick's usually accurate aim beingspoiled by the gloom of the cellar.Kilgore instantly sprang further away in the darkness, and aimed again.The hammer of his weapon fell as usual, but there was no report. In hisrecent fight at the Venner house he had emptied both of his revolvers,save the one bullet that had just missed Nick Carter.Then Kilgore, failing to have found Nick at his mercy, thought only ofmaking his own escape. He turned and ran toward the open door by whichhe had entered.At that moment Chick's ringing voice sounded from outside."This way! this way, Patsy!" he cried, louder than the rolling thunderoverhead. "I've found the rat hole!""I'm with you," yelled Patsy.They were already at the door.By the frequent flashes of lightning they had, after the fight atVenner's, succeeded in following Kilgore across the meadows, and theywell knew that he was headed to get even with Nick.Now Nick's voice rang through the cellar."Look out for him, Chick," he commanded. "He's coming that way. Look outfor his gun.""Hurrah!" roared Chick, the moment he heard Nick's voice. "Let him come,gun and all!"Kilgore saw his flight cut off in that direction, but he knew every inchof the house. He turned like a rat in the darkness, and made for thestairs leading to the floor above. Up these he hurriedly scrambled.Nick heard him through the gloom, and followed him, pitching headlong atthe foot of the stairs just as Kilgore opened the door leading to thehall above.There the dim rays from a hall lamp revealed the man for an instant, andshowed Nick the way. He was up again and after Kilgore like a houndafter a fox.Kilgore dashed through the hall, but dared not take time to unlock andopen the front door of the house. He had a profound respect for therevolver in the hand of his pursuer, who already had reached the hall.It was a flight for life, and Kilgore knew it.He turned like a flash and darted up the stairs, making for the secondfloor. Three at a stride he covered, and succeeded in reaching thecorridor above before Nick could get a line on him.Nick followed, gun in hand.On the second floor Kilgore darted into a dark chamber, and thenthrough that to one adjoining it, where he waited till he heard Nickplunging into the one first mentioned.Then Kilgore slipped out into the hall again, hoping to retrace hissteps downstairs and escape by the front door.In the way of that, however, Chick and Patsy were now in the lower hall,the former shouting lustily up the stairs:"Run him down, Nick! Run him down! We'll cover this way of escape!"An involuntary oath broke from Kilgore's lips, and at the same moment avivid flash of lightning from the inky heavens illumined all the house.From the chamber in which he stood, Nick again caught sight of his man,and was after him in an instant.Kilgore heard him coming, and again fled through the hall and up anotherflight of stairs."You'd better throw up your hands," roared Nick, as he followed.The answer came back with a yell of defiance:"Not on your life!""You're a lost dog," cried Nick, hoping to keep him replying."You'll not get me alive!""Then I'll get you dead!" cried Nick, as he mounted the stairs."You haven't got me yet!""Next door to it, my man."This brought no answer.In a moment Nick reached the second hall, where he briefly paused tolisten. Save the rain beating on the roof of the house, only one soundreached his strained ears. It was like that of some one hammeringagainst the side of the house with some heavy object. For a moment thedetective was puzzled. He could not fathom the meaning of such a sound.Then a gust of damp night air rushed through the hall and swept Nick'scheek."Ah! an open window!" he muttered. "That's easily located."He groped his way into one of the rear chambers. There the night air wassweeping in through an open window, to the sill of which Nick quicklysprang.Now the noise he had heard was instantly explained.Cornered like a rat, yet viciously resolute to the last, Kilgore had, inorder to make his escape, resorted to a means from which a less cool andnervy scoundrel would have shrunk on such a night as that.He had, by reaching far out of the window, been able to grasp anold-fashioned lightning rod with which the ancient wooden mansion wasprovided, and by which he proposed to descend to the ground. Under theswindler's weight, the beating of this swaying rod against the side ofthe house was the sound Nick had heard.Kilgore, whose courage was worthy a far better cause, already washalfway to the ground.Yet Nick had no idea of letting the knave escape thus, and he raised hisweapon to fire.There was no need for a bullet, however, for the hand of the Almightydid the work.From the black vault of the heavens a bolt of liquid fire suddenly shotearthward, with a crash of thunder that seemed to rend the entirefirmament.The fiery bolt reached the earth--but it reached it through the rod towhich Dave Kilgore was desperately clinging.Not a sound came from the doomed man as he went down--or if there was asound, it was drowned by the deafening crash and successivereverberations of thunder.Before Nick had fairly recovered from the blinding light and terrificconcussion, he heard the voice of Chick yelling loudly from below:"Nick, Nick, come down here! The house is afire. The whole house isafire!"Nick heard and darted for the stairs, at once realizing how well thelightning had done its terrific work. Before he could reach the lowerhall, dense volumes of smoke were pouring through the house, and oneentire side of the fated dwelling was in flames.Nick thought of the woman in the cellar below, and, with Chick and Patsyat his heels, he led the way to the diamond plant. The electric lighthad been extinguished by the lightning stroke, but Nick soon located thebody of Cervera, and together the detectives brought her out and laidher upon the ground some rods away from the burning dwelling."She's done for, poor wretch!" muttered Nick, as he looked at herbloodless face.He was right.Senora Cervera had danced her last dance--a terrible one it was! Shehad lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, from which she neveremerged.Next came Kilgore, and they easily found him. He lay stretched upon theground, dead and scorched almost beyond recognition, at the base of themetallic rod through which he had met his fate."Lend a hand here," said Nick. "We'll place him with his confederateuntil we can have them properly removed.""So be it," said Chick, gravely. "It's about the last we can do forthem, and this nearly ends our work on this job.""You've got the others?""Every man of them.""Well done!" nodded Nick, as they raised the lifeless form between them."Behold the way of the transgressor.""Hark!" exclaimed Patsy. "There goes the fire alarm. In three minutesthere'll be a mob about here.""Much good the firemen will do," rejoined Nick. "That house is doomed,and all that's in it."He was right. With the passing of the tempest, and the first sign of astar in the eastern sky, all that remained of the house above thediamond plant was a heap of red, smoldering embers, filling the cellarand the secret chamber--and blotting out, though perhaps not forever,the secret art of that misguided genius, Jean Pylotte, dead with abullet in his brain, on the floor of Rufus Venner's hall.There remains but little to complete the record of this strange andstirring case.Before morning Nick had lodged Venner and Spotty Dalton in the Tombs,and had Garside arrested at his residence. The lifeless bodies of theirthree confederates,--Cervera having died at dawn--were taken to theMorgue.Early the following day, Harry Boyden, the young man arrested for themurder of Mary Barton, was discharged from custody, and hastened to thehome of Violet Page, to make her happy with the news of his release andhis story of Nick Carter's extraordinary work. Both called upon Nick aday or two later, and expressed their gratitude and affection in termswhich here need no recital. Incidentally it may be added that they weremarried, as planned, the following summer.How strangely the circumstances and experiences of life are knit andbound together. But for the vicious crime of a jealous woman, Nick mighthave labored long, and possibly vainly, to run down the Kilgore gang andtheir extraordinary criminal project, in which Cervera so stronglyfigured. It was as Nick said, the two crimes seemed bound together as ifwith links of steel.In the trial which preceded the conviction and punishment of the threeliving members of the gang, Nick learned all of the facts of the case.Venner & Co., it appeared, were on their last legs, and went into thegame to square themselves, the design being to market vast quantities ofthe artificial diamonds. With this project in view, Venner had purchasedthe house at the rear of his own, under the name of Dr. Magruder, andthere had established the plant. How well the scheme would havesucceeded, but for Nick Carter, will never be known.At all events, in the stock of Venner & Co. were found numerous stoneswhich only the most proficient experts could prove to be artificial; andeven to this day it is intimated that, among the bejeweled women of NewYork there are some unconsciously wearing the manufactured diamonds ofJean Pylotte. What matters, however, since where ignorance is bliss itis folly to be wise?Jean Pylotte: His art died with him, alas! For in the ruins of thediamond plant there could be found no evidence sufficient to reveal hisgreat secret.Surely it had opened the way to a great swindle, the possibilities ofwhich can hardly be conceived. But, fortunately, in the way of it hadcome--Nick Carter.THE END.NICK CARTER STORIESNew Magnet LibraryPRICE, FIFTEEN CENTS_Not a Dull Book in This List_Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story.

These twoboys are active athletes. They are proficient in every line of sport,and they play fair or not at all.This last feature of the Merriwell stories fills our daily mail withletters from readers who say that they appreciate the integrity andfairness of the Merriwells more than words can tell.These books, while of greatest interest to the right-thinking boy areeducational and make for the development of a character which willenable the average boy to meet his fellows fairly and squarely in thebattle of life.STREET & SMITH CORPORATION79 Seventh Avenue  New York CityBill CodyAt a rough estimate there are 400 million civilized human beings whohave heard of Bill Cody, not under his real name, but by the nameeverybody called him, "Buffalo Bill."His character made him an outstanding figure during a period of thedevelopment of America when a strong character was a matter of vitalnecessity.We doubt, however, whether the man's work is fully appreciated, or everhas been. In the rush and bustle that followed the introduction of therailroad to the West, the results of Buffalo Bill's work were more orless overlooked, but a time is coming when this remarkable man'sachievements will be fully appreciated.This is the character whose adventures are dealt with in Buffalo Bill'sBorder Stories.Read them. You will find them of true historical value.STREET & SMITH CORPORATION79 Seventh Avenue  New York City***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WITH LINKS OF STEEL********** This file should be named 14096.txt or 14096.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/0/9/14096Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

[PRICE 2d.       *       *       *       *       *AMPTHILL HOUSE, THE SEAT OF LORD HOLLAND.[Illustration]This is a delightful retreat for the statesman and man ofletters--distinctions which its illustrious occupant enjoys with highhonour to his country and himself.Ampthill is throughout a never-tiring region of romantic beauties. Thesewere sung in some lines of great sweetness and poetical feeling, a fewyears since by Mr. Luttrell, who appears to have taken his muse by the arm,and "wandered up and down," describing the natural glories and oldencelebrity of Ampthill. We remember to have read his "Lines" with unmixedpleasure.The Engraving is copied from one of a Series of "Select Illustrations ofBedfordshire;" the letter-press accompaniments being neatly written by theRev. I. D. Parry, M. A. author of the "History of Woburn." Ampthillfollows.Ampthill House, now the seat of the Right Hon. Lord Holland, is a plain butvery neat edifice, built of good stone. It was erected by the first LordAshburnham, then the possessor of the estate, in 1694. It is situatedrather below the summit of a hill, which rises at some little distancebehind, and much less elevated than the site of the old castle, but hasstill a commanding situation in front, and is sufficiently elevated topossess a great share of the fine view over the vale of Bedford. It is alsowell sheltered by trees, though the passing traveller would have no idea ofthe magnificent lime alley, which is concealed behind it. The house has along front, abundantly furnished with windows, and has two deep andprojecting wings. In the centre is a plain angular pediment, bearing thelate Lord Ossory's arms, and over the door is a small circular one, piercedfor an antique bust, and supported by two three-quarter Ionic pillars. Inthis house is a small collection of paintings, &c., principally portraits.At the foot of the staircase is a large painting, formerly _in fresco_ atHoughton House, which was taken off the wall, and put on canvass by aningenious process of the late Mr. Salmon. It represents a gamekeeper, orwoodman, taking aim with a cross-bow, full front, with some curiousperspective scenery, 6 feet by 9-1/2 feet. We have heard a tradition, thatit is some person of high rank in disguise; some say James I., who was onceon a visit at Houghton. From the propensities of "gentle King Jamie," thisis not unlikely.The pleasure ground at the back of the house, commands a pleasing,extensive view; beyond this is the lime walk, which is certainly one of thefinest in England.--It is upwards of a quarter of a mile in length, thetrees in some parts, finely arching; and may be pronounced, upon the whole,superior to any walk in Oxford or Cambridge.The park in which this house stands, is well known, from many descriptions,to be a singularly picturesque and pleasing one. It is, at the same time, asmall one, but the dimensions are concealed by the numerous and beautifulgroups of trees with which it is studded. The oaks are particularlycelebrated for their great size and age, several of them are supposed to beupwards of 500 years old, and some do not hesitate to say 1,000 years; thegirth of many of them is ten yards, or considerably more. A survey of thispark, by order of the Conventional Parliament, in 1653, pronounced 287 ofthese oaks as being hollow, and too much decayed for the use of the navy.The whole of these remain to this day, and may, perhaps, continue two orthree centuries longer; some few of them have been scathed by lightning.Behind the house, near the entrance of the park from the turnpike-road, aresome ponds, similar in appearance to those frequently seen adjoiningancient mansions; above these, at the edge of a precipice, was the front ofthe ancient castle. This building is doubtless that erected by LordFanhope, at the beginning of the fifteenth century. It was used as a royalresort by Henry VIII., who was often here, and by Queen Catherine, whoresided here some time previous, and during the time her divorce was inprocess at Dunstable. There are, in the possession of Lord Holland, twoground plans of this castle, which, by the late Lord Ossory, were supposedto have been taken about the year 1616, at which time it was supposed thecastle was demolished. From these, the following particulars of thisbuilding are collected:--The area was a square of about 220 feet; in frontwas a large court, 115 feet by 120; behind this were two very small ones,each 45 feet square; and between these was an oblong courtyard. Between thefront and back courts, the building had two small lateral projections, likethe transepts of a church. In front were two square projecting towers; andround the building, at irregular distances, were nine others, projecting,of different shapes, but principally five-sided segments of octagons--ifthis description be intelligible. It was, probably, from the generalappearance of the plan, intended more as a residence for a nobleman orprince, than a fortress, although the situation was favourable for defence.The view in front is extremely beautiful for this part of the country.Lord Ossory planted a grove of firs at the back of this spot, and erected,in 1773, in the centre, a monument, consisting of an octagonal shaft raisedon four steps, surmounted by a cross, bearing a shield with QueenCatherine's arms, of Castile and Arragon. This was designed by Mr. Essex,the improver of King's College, Chapel, and is very neat, but of smalldimensions. On a tablet inserted in the base of the cross, is the followinginscription, from the pen of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, which whenread on the spot, excites some degree of interest:--  In days of yore, here Ampthill's towers were seen,  The mournful refuge of an injured queen;  Here flowed her pure, but unavailing tears,  Here blinded zeal sustained her sinking years.  Yet Freedom hence her radiant banner wav'd,  And Love avenged a realm by priests enslav'd;  From Catherine's wrongs a nation's bliss was spread,  And Luther's light from lawless Henry's bed.The possessors of Ampthill are thus traced by Mr. Parry:--The survey of Ampthill Park, made by order of Parliament, 1649, speaks ofthe castle as being long ago totally demolished.[1] There was, however,what was called the Great Lodge, or Capital Mansion. King James I. gave theHonour of Ampthill to the Earl of Kelly. It soon reverted to the Crown. In1612, Thomas, Lord Fenton, and Elizabeth his wife, resigned the office ofHigh Steward of the Honour of Ampthill to the King. The following year thecustody of the Great Park was granted to Lord Bruce, whose family becamelessees of the Honour, which they kept till 1738. In the 17th century, theNicholls's became lessees of the Great Park under the Bruces, who reservedthe office of Master of the Game. The Nicholls's resided at the CapitalMansion. After the Restoration, Ampthill Great Park was granted by CharlesII. to Mr. John Ashburnham, as some reward for his distinguished servicesto his father and himself (_vide_ Hist. Eng.) The first Lord Ashburnhambuilt the present house, in 1694. In 1720 it was purchased of this familyby Viscount Fitzwilliam, who sold it in 1736 to Lady Gowran, grandmother ofthe late Lord Ossory, who in 1800, became possessed of the lease of theHonour, by exchange with the Duke of Bedford. His family name, an ancientone in Ireland, was Fitzpatrick; he was Earl of Upper Ossory in Ireland,and Baron of the same in England. He died in 1818, and was succeeded byLord Holland, the present possessor, who has also a fine old mansion atKensington.[2]    [1] In Peck's "Desiderata Curiosa," is a list of salaries paid        in Queen Elizabeth's time to the Keepers, &c. of all the Royal        Palaces and Castles. At Ampthill they were as follow: Keeper of        the Manor House, 2l. 13s. 4d., Great Park, 4l., with herbage and        pannage, 15l.; _Paler_ of the Park, 4l. 11s. 4d., herbage and        pannage, 15l.

It sparkles with a pure and virgin lustre,  And many prize it much."OLD POET.There is something very interesting associated with a well-arranged andelegant album, embodying passages of delicate taste and superior talent,and containing the diversified, playful, pointed, eloquent, and originalpapers, of a number of intellectual and distinguished contributors.I had, a short time ago, one of these beautiful albums placed in my hand,which was characterized by marked and pre-eminent excellencies. In additionto its being bound in the most splendid manner, and containing the mosttasteful embellishments, on paper exquisitely embossed, it was adorned withappropriate contributions, from the vigorous mind of Mrs. HannahMoore--from the pure and classic taste of the eloquent Robert Hall--fromthe fervid and poetic imagination of James Montgomery--and many an elegantand beauteous production, communicated by our superior and ingeniouswriters. It was deeply interesting to mark the specimens of penmanshipwhich the various contributors furnished: the bold hand of one--the neatstyle of another--the careless and dashing strokes of another--and thestiff, awkward, and almost illegible writing of another. I was much struck,also, with the variety of mind which the album exhibited: on one page,there was the comic strain of Hood; on another, the pure and exquisitetaste of Campbell; on another, the fire and vividness of Scott; on another,the minute and graphic painting of Crabbe; and on another, the bold,condensed, and impassioned style, in which Byron so peculiarly excelled.Now, if all albums could be of this character, their value would beintrinsic and superior, and they would be permanently interesting, becauseto them we could frequently recur with refreshing and peculiar enjoyment. Iregret, however, to say, that the majority of albums are comparativelyvalueless: they are written with so much negligence; many of the pieces areof so light and frivolous a character; there is so much childish andmawkish sentimentality in numbers of the effusions poured forth; and thereis so great a destitution of solid, original, and striking thought, that,in my unpretending, yet honest estimation, the majority of albums are worthcomparatively nothing. A good album should contain pieces of genuinetalent; should be marked by no frivolity or childishness; should beconcise, pointed, and powerful in its contributions; and should embodyvaluable moral principle; and, to secure these excellencies, the possessorof an elegant album should not place it in the hand of any, accompaniedwith the request that a contribution be inserted, without ascertaining, inthe first instance, that the person solicited is of genuine taste andtalent, and real principle; because, if these qualifications be notdeveloped, an album will be merely filled with trifling, crude,unconnected, and worthless pieces--marked by no beauty, exhibiting notaste, characterized by no originality, and inculcating no valuablesentiment.T. W.       *       *       *       *       *POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.(_For the Mirror._)    No man will be found in whose mind airy notions do not sometimes    tyrannize and force him to hope or fear beyond the limits of sober    probability.--JOHNSON.The superstitions of nations must always be interesting, since they afforda criterion of the progress that knowledge and reason have made. To tracethe origin of the belief that departed spirits revisit the earth, a beliefapparently so repugnant to reason and revelation, must ever attract theattention of the curious. For it is a question of importance to religion,even although the existence of apparitions would not in the slightestdegree invalidate those sacred writings on which the bases of religion arefounded; on the contrary, if the reality of apparitions (that is of theexistence of apparitions) could be ascertained, another proof would beadded to an immense weight of testimony of the ability possessed by theDeity to arrest or alter what appears the ordinary course of nature.The existence of apparitions has been acknowledged by many, and a tendencytowards a belief of them is to be remarked in many more. Ardent, and whatis stranger still, since directly opposed to ardent, morbid minds are tooready to embrace "the pleasing dreadful thought," and to this may beattributed the prevalence of this kind of superstition among the poets, andall indeed of an enthusiastic temperament.[3] Some of the tales urged indefence of apparitions are upon a _prima facie_ observation to be traced toan exuberance[4] of imagination on the part of the ghost, others that areplainly false, and others that as they cannot be authenticated, are notworthy of notice. I shall here give what I consider an example of theformer.    [3] Dr. Johnson, it is well known, was a firm believer in        ghosts, as the following extract will show:--"That the dead are        seen no more," said Imlac, "I will undertake to maintain,        against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of all ages, and        of all nations. * * * This opinion which, perhaps, prevails as        far as human nature is diffused, could become universal only by        its truth(!): those that never heard of one another would not        have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience could make        credible."--_Rasselas_, chap. xxx.    [4] When the grammarians could not interpret some word in a        sentence, which they could make without it, they used to        attribute the unfortunate word to a natural redundancy in the        language, and in the same manner all ghost stories could be        solved by referring it to "an exuberance," &c. &c.During the celebrated Peninsular campaign, as a lady, whose son, a Frenchofficer in Spain, was seated in her room, she was astonished to perceivethe folding doors at the bottom of the apartment slowly open, and discloseto her eyes, _her son_. He begged her not to be alarmed, and informed herthat he had been just killed by a grape-shot, and even showed her the woundin his side; the doors closed again and she saw no more. In a few days shereceived a letter, which informed her that her son had fallen, afterdistinguishing himself in a most gallant manner, and mentioning the time ofhis death, which happened at precisely the same moment the apparition wasseen by her! And when I add that the lady was not _at all addicted tosuperstition_, the strangeness of the occurrence is considerably increased.What inference is to be drawn from this extraordinary tale? I confess Icannot, and do not, believe that apparitions revisit the earth even at the"glimpses o' the moon," nor does this story at all change my opinion, andfor one grand reason, which is this--That it is highly improbable that thecourse of nature would be interrupted for the production of soinsignificant an effect, for it appears an unnecessary exertion of divinepower, when the good attained would be little or none.Let us, therefore, attribute it to a powerful imagination acting on a mindalready affected with anxiety, and I believe we shall have no occasion foryielding to the idea of an apparition to explain the circumstance. I amacquainted with another tale of the same kind, but I am debarred fromrelating it, from my not being authorized to do so by the person, agentleman of large property in Scotland, to whom it occurred. Lord Byronwas much addicted to that species of superstition of which I am treating:the gloomy idea of spirits revisiting the earth to gaze on those who theyloved, was congenial to his mind, and an overheated fancy indulged beyondits due limits, converted the morbid visionary into the superstitiousascetic.There is an account of a ghost related in the Notes to Moore's Life of theNoble Poet (vol. i.) I have mentioned, which I shall detail here, as it mayhave escaped the memory of some of your readers. A captain of a merchantvessel was on a voyage to some port; having retired to rest, he wasdisturbed in the night by a horrid dream, that his brother, an officer inthe navy was drowned. He awoke and perceived something dark lying at thefoot of the hammock, and on putting out his hand discovered it was a navaluniform, wet. Some days after this his dream was confirmed by a letterinforming him of his brother's death by drowning.At Oakhampton, in Devonshire, there are the remains of a beautiful castledismantled by Henry VIII. on the attainder of Henry Courtenay, which issituated in a park, concerning which many traditions exist, one of which Iwill give here as it was told by a native. A great many years ago, therelived a lady at Oakhampton Castle, who was famous for her love of crueltyand for unbounded ostentation. This lady was killed, and her ghost hauntedsome house in Oakhampton much to the discomfiture of all the inhabitantsthereof. A conclave of "most grave and reverend signiors" was convoked, whoordained that the disturbed spirit should every night pluck a blade ofgrass till all should be gathered. And now, every night at the chilly hourof midnight, the lady in a splendid coach with four skeleton horses, askeleton coachman, and skeleton footmen, is to be seen in the park obeyingthe dictum of the Oakhampton worthies. This legend will be found, I amtold, in "Fitz, of Fitzford," by Mrs. Bray. I shall not comment on this, asit evidently appears a wild legend, on which we can found nothing.There is another tale which I shall recount here, since I can vouch for itsauthenticity.During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a gentleman went to take possession ofa house in a lone district of Ireland. The house had been uninhabited forsome time, and was out of repair. Between nine and twelve at night, whenthe gentleman had retired to rest, he was alarmed by hearing a noise; helistened, the noise increased till the house rung with the repeated shocks;he hastily sprung out of bed, and imagining it was the Rebels, he rushedinto the room where his servant slept; "Patrick, get up, the Rebels arebreaking in," said he, "Don't you hear the noise?" "Lord bless yer honor'sworship and glory, it's only the Daunder." "Daunder, sir, you rebel, theDaunder, what do you mean?" The servant explained that the knocking wasregularly heard every night at the same time, and such was the case.Various parts of the wall were pulled down, and the house almost rebuilt,but to no purpose._Foley Place._AN ANTIQUARY.       *       *       *       *       *POEMS BY A KING OF PERSIA.(_To the Editor._)It is rather an unusual thing in the present age to hear of monarchs beingauthors, and much more so of being poets. It is true, there have beeninstances of this kind in former times; but perhaps none deserved morenotice than Fath Ali Shah, the King of Persia. The author of a collectionof elegies and sonnets, Mr. Scott Waring, in his "Tour to Sheeraz," hasexhibited a specimen of the king's amatory productions. He also states thatthe government of Kashan, one of the chief cities in Persia, was the rewardof the king to the person who excelled in poetical composition.The four subjoined poems are the production of this celebrated monarch.WILLIAM RUNTING.  I.  She who is the object of my love  Has just declared she will not grant me  Another kiss, but at the price of my existence:  Ah! why have I not a thousand lives,  That I might sacrifice them all on these conditions.    The flame which she has enkindled in my heart  Is so bright, that it dazzles the universe:  It is a torch enclosed within crystal.  This heart is a Christian temple,  Wherein Beauty has established her sanctuary;  And the sighs which escape from it  Are like the loud ringing bells.[5]    Ah! too fascinating object! how dangerous  Are thy looks!--they wound indifferently  The hearts of young and old: they are  More to be dreaded than the fatal arrows of the mighty Toos.[6]  Delight us with a glimpse of thy lovely form;  Charm our senses by the elegance of thy attitudes;  Our hearts are transported by thy glances.  The proud peacock, covered with confusion,  Dares not display before thee the rich  And pompous variety of his plumage.  Thy ebon ringlets are chains, which hold  Monarchs in captivity, and make  Them slaves to the power of thy charms.    The dust on which thou treadest becomes an ornament,  Worthy of the imperial diadem of Caus.[7]  Haughty kings now prostrate themselves  Before Khacan,[8] since he has obtained  A favourable look from the object of his love.  II.  That blessing which the fountain of life  Bestowed in former ages on Khezr[9]  Thy lips can communicate in a manner  Infinitely more efficacious.  Nature, confounded at the aspect of thy lovely mouth,  Conceals her rubies within a rock;--  Our hearts, ensnared by those eyes which express  All the softness of amorous intoxication,  Are held captive in the dimples of thy chin.    Love has excited in my soul a fire  Which cannot be extinguished;--  My bosom is become red with flames,  Like a parterre of roses;--  This heart is no longer mine:  It hangs suspended on the ringlets of thy hair--  And thou, cruel fair! thou piercest it  With a glance of thy cold disdain.  Ah! inquire not into the wretched. Khacan's fate:  Thy waving locks have deprived him of reason;  But how many thousand lovers, before him,  Have fallen victims to the magic of thy beauty.  III.  My soul, captivated by thy charms,  Wastes itself away in chains, and bends beneath  The weight of oppression. Thou hast said  "Love will bring thee to the tomb--arise,  And leave his dominions" But, alas!  I wish to expire at thy feet, rather than to abandon  Altogether my hopes of possessing thee.  I swear, by the two bows that send forth  Irresistible arrows from thine eyes,  That my days have lost their lustre:  They are dark as the jet of thy waving ringlets;  And the sweetness of thy lips far exceeds,  In the opinion of Khacan, all that  The richest sugar-cane has ever yielded.  IV.  The humid clouds of spring float over the enamelled meads,  And, like my eyes, dissolve in tears.  My fancy seeks thee in all places; and the beauties  Of Nature retrace, at every moment,  Thy enchanting image. But thou, O cruel fair one!  Thou endeavourest to efface from thy memory  The recollection of my ardent love--my tender constancy.    Thy charms eclipse the growing tulip--  Thy graceful stature puts to shame the lofty cyprus.  Let every nymph, although equal in beauty to Shireen,[10]  Pay homage to thy superiority; and let all men  Become like Ferhad[11] of the mountain,  Distracted on beholding thy loveliness.    How could the star of day have shone amidst the heavens,  If the moon of thy countenance had not concealed  Its splendour beneath the cloud of a veil?  Oh! banish me not from thy sight;  Command me--it will be charitable--  Command me to die.  How long wilt thou reject the amorous solicitations  Of thy Khacan? Wilt thou drive him to madness  By thy unrelenting cruelty? The doomed  To endless tears and lamentations.    [5] A person, called the Mawezn, summons the people to prayers        from the tower, at certain stated times, by ringing bells.    [6] Toos, the son of Nouder, makes a conspicuous figure among        the princes and warriors, celebrated by Ferdoosi in his book of        Kings.    [7] Caus supposed to have been Darius the Mede by some        historians.    [8] This poetical surname Khacan, adopted by Fath Ali Shah,        signifies emperor or king.    [9] The prophet Khezr (whom some mistake for Elias) is said to        have discovered and tasted the "waters of immortality," and        consequently to be exempt from death.    [10] Shireen, the favourite of Khosroo, is no less celebrated        for her beauty than for the passion with which she inspired        Ferhad.    [11] Of this unfortunate lover Ferhad, the romantic story has        been told by several distinguished writers. The mountain to        which our royal poet alludes is the Kooh Bisetoon (in the        province of Curdistan), where are still visible many figures        sculptured in the rock, which, by the romances of Persia, are        ascribed to the statuary Ferhad. Among these sculptures,        travellers have noticed the representation of a        female--according to local tradition, the fair Shireen, mistress        to King Khosroo, and the fascinating object of Ferhad's love. As        a recompense for clearing a passage over the mountain of        Bisetoon, by removing immense rocks, which obstructed the path        (a task of such labour as far exceeded the power of common        mortals, by Ferhad, however, executed with ease), the monarch        had promised to bestow Shireen on the enamoured statuary. But a        false report of the fair one's death having been communicated to        Ferhad in a sudden manner, he immediately destroyed himself; and        the scene of this catastrophe is still shown among the recesses        of Mount Bisetoon.       *       *       *       *       *ANECDOTE GALLERY.THE LATE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE.(_From the Life and Correspondence of Sir Thomas Lawrence._)"In 1817, Sir Thomas Lawrence was commissioned to paint the portrait of theprincess a second time, and he staid at Claremont during nine days. He onemorning filled up a few vacant hours in writing to his friend, and hisdescription of the habits of the newly-married and juvenile offsprings andheirs of royalty, forms a calm, unostentatious, and delightful picture ofdomestic life. How ill such pleasures would have been exchanged for thepublic splendour and costly amusements by which they were tempted. It is asource of infinite gratification to lay before the country such a testimonyto the disposition and virtues of one, in whom centered so much of thepublic hope and love.""_Extracts from Letters of Sir Thomas Lawrence._""I am now returned from Claremont, my visit to which was agreeable to me inevery respect; both in what regarded myself, my reception, and the completesuccess of my professional labours, and in the satisfaction of seeing theperfect harmony in which this young couple now live, and of observing thegood qualities which promise to make it lasting.""The princess is, as you know, wanting in elegance of deportment, but hasnothing of the hoyden or of that boisterous hilarity which has beenascribed to her: her manner is exceedingly frank and simple, but not rudelyabrupt nor coarse; and I have, in this little residence of nine days,witnessed undeniable evidence of an honest, just, English nature, thatreminded me, from its immediate decision between the right and wrong of asubject, and the downrightness of the feeling that governed it, of the goodking, her grandfather. If she does nothing gracefully, she does everythingkindly.""She already possesses a great deal of that knowledge of the past historyof this country, that ought to form a part of her peculiar education.""It is exceedingly gratifying to see that she both loves and respectsPrince Leopold, whose conduct, indeed, and character, seem justly todeserve those feelings. From the report of the gentlemen of his household,he is considerate, benevolent, and just, and of very amiable manners. Myown observation leads me to think, that, in his behaviour to her, he isaffectionate and attentive, rational and discreet; and, in the exercise ofthat judgment which is sometimes brought in opposition to some littlethoughtlessness, he is so cheerful and slily humorous, that it is evident(at least it appears to me so) that she is already more in dread of hisopinion than of his displeasure.""Their mode of life is very regular: they breakfast together alone abouteleven: at half-past twelve she came in to sit to me, accompanied by PrinceLeopold, who stayed great part of the time: about three she would leave thepainting-room, to take her airing round the grounds in a low phaeton withher ponies, the prince always walking by her side; at five she would comein and sit to me till seven; at six, or before it, he would go out with hisgun to shoot either hares or rabbits, and return about seven or half-past;soon after which we went to dinner, the prince and princess appearing inthe drawing-room just as it was served up. Soon after the dessert appeared,the prince and princess retired to the drawing-room, whence we soon heardthe piano accompanying their voices. At his own time, Colonel Addenbrooke,the chamberlain, proposed our going in, always, as I thought, to disturbthem.""After coffee, the card-table was brought, and they sat down to whist, theyoung couple being always partners, the others changing. You know _mysuperiority_ at whist, and the unfairness of my sitting down with unskilfulplayers; I therefore did not obey command, and from ignorance of the_delicacy_ of my motives, am recommended to study Hoyle before my secondvisit there next week, which indeed must be a very short one.""The prince and princess retire at eleven o'clock."We leave out the link in the narrative that connects this pleasantdescription with the melancholy scene described in the following (for it iswritten in a sad taste) and only add, that the most amiable and beloved ofwomen died within a month from the date of the above letter."Popular love and the enthusiasm of sorrow, never towards greatness,perhaps so real, saw in her a promised Elizabeth, and while yet she livedit was a character which I should sincerely have assigned to her, as thatwhich she would most nearly have approached: certain I am that she wouldhave been a true monarch--have loved her people: charity and justice, highintegrity (as I have stated), frankness and humanity, were essentials andfixed in her character: her mind seemed to have nothing of subtlety orlittleness in it, and she had all the courage of her station.""She once said, 'I am a great coward, but I bluster it out like the best ofthem till the danger's over.' I was told by one of the members of thecouncil awaiting her delivery, that Dr. Baillie came in, and said in answerto some inquiries, 'She's doing very well: she'll not die of fear: she putsa good Brunswick face upon the matter.' She had a surprisingly quick ear,which I was pleasantly warned of: whilst playing whist, which being playedfor shillings, was not the most silent game I ever witnessed, she wouldsuddenly reply to something that the baron or I would be talking of, in thelowest tone, at the end of the room, whilst her companions at the tablewere ignorant of the cause of her observations.""I have increased respect for the Bishop of Salisbury, because he appearedto have fully performed his duty in her education. She had, as I have said,great knowledge of the history of this country, and in the businesses oflife, and a readiness in anecdotes of political parties in former reigns.""How often I see her now entering the room (constantly on his arm) withslow but firm step, always erect--and the small but elegant proportion ofher head to her figure, of course more striking from her situation. Herfeatures, as you see, were beautifully cut; her clear blue eye, so open, solike the fearless purity of truth, that the most experienced parasite musthave turned from it when he dared to _lie_.""I was stunned by her death: it was an event in the great drama of life.The return from Elba! Waterloo! St. Helena! Princess Charlotte dead!--I didnot grieve, I have not grieved half enough for her: yet I never think ofher, speak of her, write of her without tears, and have often, when alone,addressed her in her bliss, as though she now saw me, heard me; and it isbecause I respect her for her singleness of worth, and am grateful for herpast and meditated kindness.""Her manner of addressing Prince Leopold was always as affectionate as itwas simple--'My love;' and his always, 'Charlotte.' I told you that when wewent in from dinner they were generally sitting at the pianoforte, often onthe same chair. I never heard her play, but the music they had been playingwas always of the finest kind.""I was at Claremont, on a call of inquiry, the Saturday before her death.Her last command to me was, that I should bring down the picture to give toPrince Leopold upon his birthday, the 16th of the next month. * * *""If I do not make reply to different parts of your letter (alwayssatisfactory in a correspondence), it is because I fear, having no longtime to write in, that I may lose something by delay, in narrating thecircumstances of my yesterday's visit to Claremont, when I was enabledthrough the gracious kindness of my sovereign, to fulfil that promise sosolemnly given and now become so sacred a pledge.""It was my wish that Prince Leopold should see the picture on his firstentering the room to his breakfast, and accordingly at seven o'clock I setoff with it in a coach. I got to Claremont, uncovered and placed it in theroom in good time. Before I took it there, I carried it in to ColonelAddenbrooke, Baron Hardenbroch, and Dr. Short, who had been her tutor. SirRobert Gardiner came in, and went out immediately. Dr. Short looked at itfor some time in silence, but I saw his lips trembling, and his eyes filledto overflowing. He said nothing, but went out; and soon after him ColonelAddenbrooke. The baron and I then placed the picture in the prince's room.""When I returned to take my breakfast, Colonel Addenbrooke came in; hesaid, 'I don't know what to make of these fellows; there's Sir RobertGardiner swears he can't stay in the room with it: that if he sees it inone room, he'll go into another.'--Then there's Dr. Short. I said, Isuppose by your going out and saying nothing, you don't like the picture.'Like it,' he said, (and he was blubbering) ''tis so like her, and soamiable, that I could not stay in the room.'--More passed on the subject,not worth detailing. I learnt that the prince was very much overcome by thesight of the picture, and the train of recollections that it brought withit. Colonel Addenbrooke went in to the prince, and returning shortly, said,'The prince desires me to say how much obliged to you he is for thisattention, that he shall always remember it. He said, 'Do you think SirThomas Lawrence would wish to see me? If he would, I shall be very glad tosee him.'--I replied that I thought you would: so if you like, he will seeyou whenever you choose, before your departure.' Soon after, I went in tohim. As I passed through the hall, Dr. Short came up to me, (he hadevidently been, and was crying,) and thanked me for having painted such apicture. 'No one is a better judge than I am, sir,' and he turned away.""The prince was looking exceedingly pale; but he received me with calmfirmness, and that low, subdued voice that you know to be the _effort_ atcomposure. He spoke at once about the picture and of its value to him morethan to all the world besides. From the beginning to the close of theinterview, he was greatly affected. He checked his first burst ofaffection, by adverting to the public loss, and that of the royal family.'Two generations gone!--gone in a moment! I have felt for myself, but Ihave felt for the Prince Regent. My Charlotte is gone from this country--ithas lost her. She was a good, she was an admirable woman. None could knowmy Charlotte as I did know her! It was my happiness, my duty to know hercharacter, but it was my delight.' During a short pause I spoke of theimpression it had made on me. 'Yes, she had a clear, fine understanding,and very quick--she was candid, she was open, and not suspecting, but shesaw characters at the glance--she read them so true. You saw her; you sawsomething of us--you saw us for some _days_--you saw our _year!_ Oh! whathappiness--and it was solid--it could not change, for we knew eachother--except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, and we_could_ be together--we did not tire.'""I tried to check this current of recollection, that was evidentlyoverpowering him (as it was me) by a remark on a part of the picture, andthen on its likeness to the youth of the old king. 'Ah! and my child waslike her, for one so young, (as if it had really lived in childhood.) Forone so young it was surprisingly like--the nose, it was higher thanchildren's are--the mouth, so like hers; so cut (trying to describe itsmouth on his own.) My grief did not think of it, but if I could have had adrawing of it! She was always thinking of others, not of herself--no one solittle selfish--always looking out for comfort for others. She had been forhours, for many hours, in great pain--she was in that situation whereselfishness must act if it exists--when _good_ people will be selfish,because pain makes them so--and my Charlotte was not--any grief could notmake her so! She thought our child was alive; I knew it was not, and Icould not support her mistake. I left the room, for a short time: in myabsence they took courage, and informed her. When she recovered from it,she said, 'Call in Prince Leopold--there is none can comfort him but me! MyCharlotte, my dear Charlotte! And now, looking at the picture, he said,Those beautiful hands, that at the last, when she was talking to otherswere always looking out for mine!'""I need not tell you my part in this interview; he appeared to rely on mysharing his thoughts."       *       *       *       *       *"Towards the close of our interview, I asked him, 'if the princess at the_last_ felt her danger?' He said, 'No; my Charlotte thought herself veryill, but not in danger. And she was so well but an hour and a half afterthe delivery!--And she said I should not leave her again--and I shouldsleep in that room--and she should have in the sofa bed--and she shouldhave it where she liked--she herself would have it fixed. She was strong,and had so much courage, yet once she seemed to fear. You remember she wasaffected when you told her that you could not paint my picture just at thattime; but she was much more affected when we were alone--and I told her Ishould sit when we went to Marlborough House after her confinement, 'Then,'she said, 'if you are to sit when you go to town, and after myconfinement--then I may never see that picture.' My Charlotte felt shenever should.""More passed in our interview, but not much more--chiefly, my part in it.At parting he pressed my hand firmly--held it long, I could almost sayaffectionately, I had been, by all this conversation, so impressed withesteem for him, that an attempt to kiss his hand that grasped mine wasresistless, but it was checked on both sides. _I_ but bowed--and he drew myhand towards him: he then bade me good by, and on leaving the room turnedback to give me a slow parting nod,--and though half blinded myself, I wasstruck with the exceeding paleness of his look across the room. His bodilyhealth, its youthfulness cannot sink under this heaviest affliction! Andhis mind is rational; but when _thus_ leaving the room, his tall darkfigure, pale lace, and solemn manner, for the moment, looked a melancholypresage.""I know that your good-nature will forgive my not answering your letter indetail, since I have refrained from it but to give you this narration ofbeings so estimable, so happy, and so parted.""Prince Leopold's voice is of very fine tone, and gentle; and itsarticulation exceedingly clear, accurate, and impressive, without theslightest affectation. You know that sort of reasoning emphasis of mannerwith which the tongue conveys whatever deeply interests the mind. His 'MyCharlotte!' is affecting; he does not pronounce it as 'Me Charlotte,' butvery simply and evenly, '_My_ Charlotte.'"       *       *       *       *       *NOTES OF A READER.KNOWLEDGE FOR THE PEOPLE.Part VII.--_Mechanics._We quote a few articles from the Introductory portion, illustrating thegeneral principles of Mechanical agencies.Why are we said to know of nothing which is absolutely at rest?Because the earth is whirling round its axis, and round the sun; the sun ismoving round his axis, and round the centre of gravity of the solar system;and, doubtless, round some more remote centre in the great universe,carrying all his planets and comets about his path. One of the grand lawsof nature is, that all bodies persevere in their present state, whether ofmotion or rest, unless disturbed by some foreign power. Motion, therefore,once began, would be continued for ever, were it to meet with nointerruption from external causes, such as the power of gravity, theresistance of the medium, &c. Dr. Arnott adduces several familiarillustrations of motions and forces. Thus, all falling and pressing bodiesexhibit _attraction_ in its simplest form. _Repulsion_ is instanced inexplosion, steam, the action of springs, &c. Explosion of gunpowder isrepulsion among the particles when assuming the form of air. Steam, by therepulsion among its particles, moves the piston of the steam-engine. Allelasticity, as seen in springs, collision, &c. belongs chiefly torepulsion. A spring is often, as it were, a reservoir of force, kept readycharged for a purpose; as when a gun-lock is cocked, a watch wound up, &c.Why does a billiard ball stop when it strikes directly another ball ofequal size, and the second ball proceed with the whole velocity which thefirst had?Because the action which imparts the new motion is equal to the re-actionwhich destroys the old. Although the transference of motion, in such acase, seems to be instantaneous, the change is really progressive, and isas follows:--The approaching ball, at a certain point of time, has justgiven half of its motion to the other equal ball; and if both were of softclay, they would then proceed together with half the original velocity;but, as they are elastic, the touching parts at the moment supposed, arecompressed like a spring between the balls; and by their expanding, andexerting force equally both ways, they double the velocity of the foremostball, and destroy altogether the motion in the other.Why does a walking stick help a man on a journey?Because he pushes against the ground with the stick, which may beconsidered as compressing a spring between the earth and the end of hisstick, which spring is therefore pushing up as much as he pushes down; andif, at the time, he were balanced in the scales of a weighing beam, hewould find that he weighed just as much less as he were pressing with hisstick.Why is sea-sickness produced on shipboard?Because man, strictly to maintain his perpendicularity, that is, to keepthe centre of gravity always over the support of his body, requiresstandards of comparison, which he obtains chiefly by the perpendicularityor known position of things about him, as on land; but on shipboard, wherethe lines of the masts, windows, furniture, &c. are constantly changing,his standards of comparison are soon lost or disturbed. Hence, also, thereason why persons unaccustomed to the motion of a ship, often find reliefby keeping their eyes directed to the fixed shore, where it is visible, orby lying on their backs, and shutting their eyes; and, on the other hand,the ill-effects of looking over the side of the vessel at the restlesswaves of the sea.Why is the pendulum a time-keeper?Because the times of the vibrations are very nearly equal, whether it bemoving much or little; that is to say, whether the arc described by it belarge or small. A common clock is merely a pendulum, with wheel-workattached to it, to record the number of the vibrations; and with a weightor spring, having force enough to counteract the retarding effects offriction and the resistance of the air. The wheels show how many swings orbeats of the pendulum have taken place, because at every beat, a tooth ofthe last wheel is allowed to pass. Now, if this wheel has sixty teeth, asis common, it will just turn round once for sixty beats of the pendulum, orseconds; and a hand fixed on its axis, projecting through the dial-plate,will be the second hand of the clock. The other wheels are so connectedwith this first, and the numbers of the teeth on them so proportioned, thatone turns sixty times slower than the first, to fit its axis to carry aminute hand; and another, by moving twelve times slower still, is fitted tocarry an hour-hand.--_Arnott._Why do clocks denote the progress of time?Because they count the oscillations of a pendulum; and by that peculiarproperty of the pendulum, that one vibration commences exactly where thelast terminates, no part of time is lost or gained in the juxtaposition (orputting together) of the units so counted, so that the precise fractionalpart of a day can be ascertained, which each such unit measures. The originof the pendulum is traced to Galileo's observation of a hanging lamp in achurch at Pisa continuing to vibrate long and with singular uniformity,after any accidental cause of disturbance. Hence he was led to investigatethe laws of the phenomenon, and out of what, in some shape or other, hadbeen before men's eyes from the beginning of the world, his powerful geniusextracted the most important results. The invention of pendulum clocks tookplace about the middle of the seventeenth century; and the honour of thediscovery is disputed between Galileo and Huygens. Becher contends forGalileo, and states that one Trifler made the first pendulum clock atFlorence, under the direction of Galileo Galilei, and that a model of itwas sent to Holland. The Accademia del Cimento also expressly declared,that the application of the pendulum to the movement of a clock, was firstproposed by Galileo, and put in practice by his son, Vincenzo Galileo, in1649. Huygens, however, contests the priority, and made a pendulum clockbefore 1658; and he insists, that if ever Galileo had entertained such anidea, he never brought it to perfection. Beckmann says the first pendulumclock made in England, was constructed in the year 1662, by one Tromantil,a Dutchman; but Grignon affirms that the first pendulum clock was made inEngland, by Robert Harris, in 1641, and erected in Inigo Jones's church ofSt. Paul, Covent-garden.Why does the pendulum move faster in proportion as its journey is longer?Because, in proportion as the arc described is more extended, the steeperare its beginning and ending; and the more rapidly, therefore, the pendulumfalls down at first, sweeps along the intermediate space, and stops atlast.--_Arnott._Why is it extremely difficult to ascertain the exact length of thependulum?Because of the various expansion of metals, respecting which no twopyrometers agree; the changeable nature of the atmosphere; the uncertaintyas to the true level of the sea; the extreme difficulty of measuringaccurately the distance between the point of suspension and the centre ofoscillation, and even of finding that centre; also the variety ofterrestrial attraction, from which cause the motions of the pendulum arealso liable to variation, even in the same latitude. In pursuing hisresearches, Capt. Kater discovered that the motions of the pendulum areaffected by the nature of the strata over which it vibrates.Why is the iron rim of a coach wheel heated before putting on?Because the expansion of the metal occasioned by the heat, facilitates theoperation of putting on the iron, while the contraction which follows,brings the joints of the wooden part together; and thus, binding the whole,gives great strength to the wheel.Why does a bottle of fresh water, corked and let down 30 or 40 feet intothe sea, often come up again with the water saltish, although the cork bestill in its place?Because the cork, when far down, is so squeezed as to allow the water topass in or out by its sides, but on rising, it resumes its former size.Why do bubbles rise on a cup of tea when a lump of sugar is dropped intoit?Because the sugar is porous, and the air which filled its pores thenescapes to the surface of the tea, and the liquid takes its place.Why is there an opening in the centre of the upper stone of a corn mill?Because through this opening the grain is admitted and kept turning roundbetween the stones, and is always tending and travelling outwards, until itescapes as flour from the circumference.Why does water remain in a vessel which is placed in a sling and made todescribe a circle?Because the water, by its inertia of straightness, or centrifugal (orcentre-flying) force, tends more away from the centre of motion towards thebottom of the vessel, than towards the earth by gravity.Why does a young quadruped walk much sooner than a child?Because a body is tottering in proportion to its great altitude and narrowbase. Now, the child has this latter, and learns to walk but slowly,because of the difficulty, perhaps in ten or twelve months, while the youngof quadrupeds, having a broad supporting base, are able to stand, and evento move about almost immediately; but it is the noble prerogative of man tobe able to support his towering figure with great firmness, on a verynarrow base, and under constant change of attitude.--_Arnott._       *       *       *       *       *FINE ARTS.THE ROYAL ACADEMY.(_From a Correspondent._)The exhibition of works of art in the Royal Academy this year is equal toany preceding, except in the department of portraiture; nor is thisdeficiency by any means extraordinary, when we consider the severe loss thearts have sustained by the death of Sir Thomas Lawrence.

N.       *       *       *       *       *SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALSBILLINGTON.(Print her name in grand capitals, Mr. Compositor)--Billington returnedfrom Italy! My father, who remembered, I suspect, the beautiful woman morethan the accomplished singer, determined to hear again her _Mandane_; andsorely against my will, I rather think to prevent the chance of my doingmischief at home, forced me to go along with him. With listless andunwilling ears I listened to her and Mrs. Mountain, that second best ofEnglish singers throughout "Fair Aurora." Gradually, however, andinvoluntarily, I became pleased, interested, delighted; and when theencored "Soldier tired" was ended, had I but possessed so much Italian,"Sono anch'io Cantatore" would have burst from my lips with as much fervourand devotedness of resolution as the "Sono anch'io Pittore" of the artist.From this moment never had I three shillings and sixpence in my pocket, andeither Billington's or Braham's name in the bills of the night, that I wasnot to be seen planted in the front row of the pit, looking over theleader's book, and taking the only lessons I ever received in music. Theopera over, no farce, however laughable, not even the "Turnpike Gate" withJoe Munden's _Crack_, had the power to detain me in the house.--My time of_imitation_ was arrived, and I sallied forth to alarm watchmen with thelast division of the "Soldier tired," affront my friends by saluting themwith "Adieu thou dreary pile," or annoy my father with shouting "TheAustrian trumpet's loud alarms" at a moment when, with all the fervour oftrue John Bull anti-gallicanism, he was lamenting over Ulm and Austerlitz;execrating Mack, pitying Francis and Alexander, and cursing the victoriousNapoleon by all his gods.--_Harmonicon_, No. 41.       *       *       *       *       *SUFFICING REASONS FOR SHAKING.At a charity concert, given some time since in the sister island, one ofthe reverend directors, or stewards, was shocked at a long shake made by ajuvenile chorister in the passage "and they were sore afraid" in the_Messiah_, and remonstrated with the boy's instructor on the impropriety ofsuch an ornament to such words."And is it in regard to the shake you'd be spaking, sir?" replied themaster. "Sure and if ye were sore afraid yourself, would not ye be shaking?Ay, I'll be your bail that you would, and shaking in your shoes too! Plaseto leave me and my pupil alone: many a one will be coming to-morrow twentyand thirty miles, every inch of it, to hear Master ---- sing, that wouldnot step out twenty yards to hear you prache."--_Ibid._       *       *       *       *       *CALCULATING NOTES.--PAGANINI.Stephen Storace had a remarkably good head for figures. When a boy, hispassion for calculation was beyond all belief. Michael Kelly says, he hasbeen known to multiply four figures by four figures, by memory, in threeminutes. When young, Kelly tells us, Storace was so astonished that fiftyguineas should be paid for _singing a song_, that he counted the notes init, and calculated the amount of each at 4s. 10d.This passion for calculating the value of notes (musical ones) has seized aParisian dilettante, who, according to the _Furet de Londres_, has beenfixing the price of every note and rest in certain pieces played byPaganini recently, at a concert given at the Opera at Paris, which producedhim 16,500 francs. The following is the result:--He performed, during theevening, three pieces, each occupying five pages of music, of about 91 barsto the page. The fifteen pages thus contained 1,365 bars, by which the16,500 francs are to be divided. The quotient will be 12 francs for eachbar, or the proportions will be as follows:--For a semibreve, 12f.; a minim6f.; a crotchet, 3f.; a quaver, 1f. 50c.; a semiquaver, 15 sous; ademisemiquaver, 7-1/2 sous. And, on the other hand, for a minim rest, 6f.;a crotchet rest, 3f.; &c. There would still remain out of the 16,500francs, 420, which is exactly the price of such a violin as theConservatory awards as a prize to its most distinguished pupils.All this may be play to Paganini, but destruction to less fortunatemusicians, for he swallows up all that would otherwise be distributed amongmany. An English violinist must work many long laborious days and nightsbefore he can _scrape_ together six hundred and eighty-seven poundssterling--the sum, it seems, which the lucky Italian gets by a singleconcert!--_Ibid._       *       *       *       *       *THE SELECTOR AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.FREEMASONRY.In a neat volume, called _The Freemasons' Pocket Companion_, of size to fitthe waistcoat pocket, we find the following brief sketch of the History ofFreemasonry in England. This little Manual is "By a Brother of the ApolloLodge, 711, Oxford," who acknowledges his obligation to Oliver and Preston,an article on Masonry, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, &c.:--In Britain, we are informed that St. Alban, the first martyr forChristianity in this country, was a great patron of the masons, andprocured leave from the King or Emperor Carausius for a general meeting orassembly to be held by them, and higher wages to be given them. But we haveno good reason, I think, to believe that these masons had much connexionwith our fraternity, nor that freemasonry was introduced into Britainbefore the time of St. Austin, who, with forty more monks, among whom thesciences were preserved, was commissioned by Pope Gregory to baptizeEthelbert, King of Kent. About this time appeared those tradingassociations of architects who travelled over Europe, patronised by the Seeof Rome. The difficulty of obtaining expert workmen for the many piousworks raised at that time in honour of religion, made it prudent toencourage, by peculiar privileges, those bodies of men, who had devotedthemselves to the study and practice of architecture. Accordingly they wereallowed to have their own government without opposition, and no others werepermitted to work on any building with which they were concerned. They wereunder regular command, divided into lodges, with a master and wardens ineach, and dwelt in an encampment near the building they were employed toerect.It is not in my power to trace the progress of these lodges of masons inany connected history, but I will proceed with the accounts we have of themasons in England from the time of St. Austin. By them the old cathedral ofCanterbury was built, in 600; St. Paul's, London, 604; and St. Peter's,Westminster, 605; with many others. In the year 680 some more expertbrethren from France were formed into a lodge, under the direction ofBennet, Abbot of Wirral, who was appointed superintendent of the masons byKinred, King of Mercia. From this time, however, little is known of thefraternity, until the year 856, when St. Swithin was the superintendent,appointed by Ethelwolf; from which time it gradually improved till the year872, when King Alfred took the command of it. Upon his death, in 900, whenEdward succeeded to the throne, and Ethred, Prince of Mercia, patronisedthe society, Edward was succeeded, in 924, by his son, Athelstan, whosebrother, Edwin, procured from the king a charter for the masons, by whichthey were empowered to meet annually in a general assembly, and to havepower to regulate their own order. And, according to this charter, thefirst grand lodge of England met at York, in 926. But here it is to beremarked that the grand lodge is not to be understood as the same in thosetimes that it is now; it was not then restricted to the masters and wardensof private lodges, but was open to as many of the fraternity as couldattend: for, until late years, the grand lodge as now constituted did notexist, but there was but one family of masons; and any sufficient number ofmasons met together, with the consent of the civil magistrate, to practisethe rites of masonry, without warrant of constitution as a lodge.On the death of Prince Edwin, Athelstan himself presided over the lodges;but after his decease, we know little of the state of the masons inBritain, except that they were governed by Dunstan, Archbishop ofCanterbury, in 960, and Edward the Confessor in 1041. But in 1066, Williamthe Conqueror appointed Gondulph, Bishop of Rochester, to preside over thesociety. In 1100, Henry the First patronised them; and in 1135, during thereign of Stephen, the society was under the command of Gilbert de Clare,Marquess of Pembroke.From the year 1155 to 1199, the fraternity was under the command of thegrand master of the knights templars.In 1199, Peter de Colechurch was appointed grand master; and the societycontinued to increase and flourish in the successive reigns of Henry III.,Edward I., Edward II., and Edward III. This last prince revised theconstitutions of the order, and appointed deputies to superintend thefraternity, one of whom was William a Wykeham, afterwards Bishop ofWinchester. He continued grand master under the reign of Richard II.; wassucceeded by Thomas Fitz Allen, Earl of Surrey, in Henry IV.'s reign; andon Henry V.'s accession, Chichely, Archbishop of Canterbury, presided overthe society. We have records of a lodge held at Canterbury, under hispatronage, where Thos. Stapylton was master, and the names of the wardensand other brethren are given. This was in 1429, four years after an act ofparliament, passed early in the reign of Henry VI., against the meetings ofthe society, which was caused by the enmity of Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop ofWinchester, towards Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the king's uncle, a greatpatron of the craft. But this act was never enforced, and in 1442 the kingwas himself initiated, and he patronised the society.In the meantime, under the auspices of James I. of Scotland, masonryflourished in that country. It had been nursed, during the wars whichravaged Europe, in the humble village of Kilwinning, in the west of thecountry; from whence it at length burst forth, and communicated its lightto the lodges in the south. The records of this lodge actually go back tothe beginning of the fifteenth century, as also do those of a lodge in ornear Edinburgh. And about this time the Scottish king appointed a fee to bepaid by every master to the grand master, who was chosen by the grandlodge. James II. of Scotland made the grand mastership hereditary, andconferred it on the St. Clairs of Roslin, in which family it continued till1736, when the then representative of the family, being old and childless,resigned it into the hands of the grand lodge, then first established onits present footing, by whom he was re-elected grand master for life.During the civil wars in England masonry declined; but on the accession ofHenry VII., in 1485, it revived again, under the patronage of the grandmaster of the order of St. John, at Rhodes, who, in 1500, chose King Henrytheir protector. In 1502 this king presided in person in a lodge of mastermasons, and proceeded in ample form to lay the foundation of the chapel, atthe east end of Westminster Abbey, which bears his name.The fraternity continued to flourish in the next reigns; and in the reignof Elizabeth, about 1550, Sir Thos. Sackville, then grand master, assembledthe general lodge at York, which is said to have roused the jealousy of thequeen; and she intended to break up the meeting, but being informed thatthey did not meddle with politics, she withdrew her orders, and permittedthem to meet unmolested. Sackville was succeeded by Sir Thomas Gresham, inthe south, who built the Royal Exchange, and by Francis Russell, Earl ofBedford, in the north.Masonry continued to flourish in the next reign, under Inigo Jones, asgrand master, till 1618, when the Earl of Pembroke succeeded him; and aftersome more changes, Jones again was elected, and continued to preside tillhis death, in 1646. But the civil war again obstructed the progress of theorder, until the Restoration, when it revived under the auspices of CharlesII.In 1663, the Earl of St. Alban's was elected grand master, who appointedMr. (afterwards Sir Christopher) Wren his deputy; which office he helduntil 1685, when he was himself appointed to the grand chair. During hisdeputy-ship he erected many noble buildings, particularly the cathedral ofSt. Paul's.The short reign of James II. was not favourable to the order of masons; nordid it begin again to revive for many years. King William III. wasinitiated privately in 1695, and approved the choice of Sir ChristopherWren as grand master; but shortly after, and during the whole reign ofQueen Anne, the society decreased gradually, for the grand master's ageprevented his attending regularly, and the annual feasts were neglected.On the accession, therefore, of Geo. I. the masons in London determined torevive, if possible, the grand lodge and the communications of the societyunder a new grand master, Sir Christopher Wren being dead. In February,1717, accordingly, the only four lodges then existing in London met, andvoting the oldest master mason, constituted themselves a grand lodge; andon St. John Baptist's day, meeting again, they elected Anthony Sayer, Esq.,grand master, and he was regularly installed by the grand master who hadbefore been voted into the chair.Mr. Sayer was succeeded by George Payne, Esq., in 1718, who collected allthe records of the society--by which means some copies of the old Gothicconstitutions were produced and arranged. In 1719, Dr. Desaguliers wasgrand master, and by his activity the order made great progress; and at thefeast of his installation, the custom of drinking healths was firstintroduced. In the next, year, under Mr. Payne again, the fraternitysustained a great loss by the burning of some valuable manuscripts, by sometoo scrupulous brethren; and next year, the Duke of Montague was proposedfor, and accepted the chair of grand master.       *       *       *       *       *In 1726, the masons of Wales attached themselves to the grand lodge ofEngland, and the office of provincial master was instituted soon after. TheSociety was introduced into India in 1728, and the grand lodge of Americaconstituted, by warrant from London, in 1735; and that of Holland, atHamburgh, in the same year. In 1738, the Book of Constitutions waspublished; the grand lodge of Prussia constituted under the Scotchconstitution, and has ever since flourished in that country; and in 1774,the grand lodge of Antigua was established, by warrant from the grand lodgeof England.Correspondence was opened with the grand lodge of France in 1768; with thatof Holland in 1770; and that of Berlin in 1776. On the 1st of May, 1775,the foundation-stone of the Freemasons' Hall was laid; and the building wasopened and dedicated in solemn form on the 23rd of May, 1776, Lord Petrebeing then grand master.In 1779, a correspondence was established with the grand lodge of Germany;and in 1782 an attempt was made to open one with those of Scotland andIreland. This was not then effected; but in 1803 explanations were made tothe grand lodge of Scotland regarding the schism in England; in consequenceof which, two years after, the wished for union was accomplished; and in1808 the same gratifying proposals were made from Ireland, and acceptedwith cordiality. Meantime, the same brotherly communication had beeninstituted with Sweden in 1799, and Prussia in 1805.While these friendly communications with foreign brethren were going on,masonic benevolence, ever privately exercised, had made a public exertionin favour of the children of deceased brethren at home, in theestablishment of the charity for female children, in 1788; of the masonicsociety for the relief of sick, lame, or distressed brethren, and theirwidows, children, or orphans, in 1799. In the year 1816 freemasonry wasrevived in Russia, under the patronage of the emperor, and communicationsforwarded from the grand lodge at St. Petersburgh to that in London.       *       *       *       *       *MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.WATER AT SHAFTESBURY.Motcomb, half a mile north from Shaftesbury, is noted for containing thewells from which the inhabitants of Shaftesbury are supplied with water.Great numbers of the inhabitants get their living by carrying water, forwhich they have three halfpence or twopence the horse load. On this accountthere is a particular custom yearly observed, according to ancientagreement, dated 1662, between the Lord of the Manor of Gillingham, and theMayor and Burgesses of Shaftesbury. The Mayor is obliged, the Monday beforeHoly Thursday, to dress up a prize bezon, or bizant, somewhat like a Maygarland in form, with gold and peacocks' feathers, and carry to EnmoriGreen, half a mile below the town in Motcomb, as an acknowledgment for thewater, together with a raw calf's head, a pair of gloves, a gallon of beeror ale, and two penny loaves of white wheaten bread, which the stewardreceives and carries away for his own use. The ceremony being over, thebizant is restored to the Mayor, and brought back by one of his officerswith great solemnity. This bizant is generally so richly adorned with plateand jewels, borrowed from the neighbouring gentry, as to be worth not lessthan L1,500.C.

"His Majesty's Ship Atholl, at Sea, Bight of Biafra, Feb. 2, 1831.""Dear Sir,--I take the opportunity of writing you a few lines, by a vesselthat we have just now met on her way to England. My object in writing inthis hasty manner is to acquaint you that the grand geographical problemrespecting the termination of the Niger is at length solved.""The Landers, after having reached Youri, embarked in a canoe on the Niger,or, as it is called there, the Quarra, and came down the stream until theyreached the sea, in the Bight of Biafra. The branch by which they came tothe coast is called the Nun, or Brasse River, being the first river to theeastward of Cape Formosa. On their way down the river they were attacked bythe Hibboos (a fierce nation that inhabit its banks), and made prisoners,or rather captives; but the King of Brasse happening to be in that countrybuying slaves, got them released, by giving the price of six slaves foreach of them. In the scuffle that ensued at the time they were taken, oneof them lost his journal.""Whilst at Youri they got the Prayerbook that belonged to Mr. Anderson, thebrother-in-law and fellow-traveller of the celebrated Mungo Park. They wereupwards of a month at Fernando Po, whence they embarked, about ten daysago, in an English merchant-vessel bound to Rio Janeiro, on their way toEngland. From their taking that circuitous route, I am in hopes that thiswill reach you before they arrive, by which you will probably have it inyour power to give the first news of this important discovery.""I do not recollect of any thing else to acquaint you with that is worthyof notice; and even if I did, I have no time to mention it, as the boat bywhich I send this (to the vessel) is just this moment ordered away.""I must therefore bid you adieu for the present; and believe me, dear sir,yours very sincerely.""ALEXANDER FISHER."       *       *       *       *       *THE GATHERER.

He tells us that Louis theEleventh swore by "_God's Easter;_" Charles the Eighth, by "_God's light;_"Louis the Twelfth used an oath, still common among the French rabble, "_TheDevil take me;_" but the oath of Francis the First was polished enough forthe present day: it was, "_On the word of a gentleman_."K----ll, Norfolk.C.

Jacobs[Illustration: 'I tell you, I am as innercent as a new-born babe'.]SKILLED ASSISTANCEThe night-watchman, who had left his seat on the jetty to answer thegate-bell, came back with disgust written on a countenance only too welldesigned to express it."If she's been up 'ere once in the last week to, know whether the<i>Silvia</i> is up she's been four or five times," he growled.  "He's forty-seven if he's a day; 'is left leg is shorter than 'is right, and he talkswith a stutter.  When she's with 'im you'd think as butter wouldn't meltin 'er mouth; but the way she talked to me just now you'd think I waspaid a-purpose to wait on her.  I asked 'er at last wot she thought I washere for, and she said she didn't know, and nobody else neither.  Andafore she went off she told the potman from the 'Albion,' wot waslistening, that I was known all over Wapping as the Sleeping Beauty."She ain't the fust I've 'ad words with, not by a lot.  They're all thesame; they all start in a nice, kind, soapy sort o' way, and, as soon asthey don't get wot they want, fly into a temper and ask me who, I think Iam.  I told one woman once not to be silly, and I shall never forget itas long as I live-never.  For all I know, she's wearing a bit o' my 'airin a locket to this day, and very likely boasting that I gave it to her."Talking of her reminds me of another woman.  There was a Cap'n Pinner,used to trade between 'ere and Hull on a schooner named the Snipe.  Nicelittle craft she was, and 'e was a very nice feller.  Many and many's thepint we've 'ad together, turn and turn-about, and the on'y time we ever'ad a cross word was when somebody hid his clay pipe in my beer and 'ewas foolish enough to think I'd done it."He 'ad a nice little cottage, 'e told me about, near Hull, and 'iswife's father, a man of pretty near seventy, lived with 'em.  Well-offthe old man was, and, as she was his only daughter, they looked to 'aveall his money when he'd gorn.  Their only fear was that 'e might marryagin, and, judging from wot 'e used to tell me about the old man, Ithought it more than likely."'If it wasn't for my missis he'd ha' been married over and over agin,'he ses one day.  'He's like a child playing with gunpowder.'"''Ow would it be to let 'im burn hisself a bit?' I ses."'If you was to see some o' the gunpowder he wants to play with, youwouldn't talk like that,' ses the cap'n.  'You'd know better.  The on'ything is to keep 'em apart, and my pore missis is wore to a shadder a-doing of it.'"It was just about a month arter that that he brought the old man up toLondon with 'im.  They 'ad some stuff to put out at Smith's Wharf,t'other side of the river, afore they came to us, and though they wason'y there four or five days, it was long enough for that old man to getinto trouble."The skipper told me about it ten minutes arter they was made snug in theinner berth 'ere.  He walked up and down like a man with a ragingtoothache, and arter follering 'im up and down the wharf till I was tiredout, I discovered that 'is father-in-law 'ad got 'imself mixed up with awidder-woman ninety years old and weighing twenty stun.  Arter he 'adcooled down a bit, and I 'ad given 'im a few little pats on the shoulder,'e made it forty-eight years old and fourteen stun."'He's getting ready to go and meet her now,' he ses, 'and wot mymissis'll say to me, I don't know.'"His father-in-law came up on deck as 'e spoke, and began to brush'imself all over with a clothesbrush.  Nice-looking little man 'e was,with blue eyes, and a little white beard, cut to a point, and dressed upin a serge suit with brass buttons, and a white yachting cap.  His realname was Mr. Finch, but the skipper called 'im Uncle Dick, and he tooksuch a fancy to me that in five minutes I was calling 'im Uncle Dick too."'Time I was moving,' he ses, by and by.  'I've got an app'intment.'"'Oh! who with?' ses the skipper, pretending not to know."'Friend o' mine, in the army,' ses the old man, with a wink at me.  'Solong.'"He went off as spry as a boy, and as soon as he'd gorn the skipperstarted walking back'ards and for'ards agin, and raving."'Let's 'ope as he's on'y amusing 'imself,' I ses."'Wait till you see 'er,' ses the skipper; 'then you won't talkfoolishness.'"As it 'appened she came back with Uncle Dick that evening, to see 'imsafe, and I see at once wot sort of a woman it was.  She 'adn't been onthe wharf five minutes afore you'd ha' thought it belonged to 'er, andwhen she went and sat on the schooner it seemed to be about 'arf itssize.  She called the skipper Tom, and sat there as cool as you pleaseholding Uncle Dick's 'and, and patting it."I took the skipper round to the 'Bull's Head' arter she 'ad gorn, and Iwouldn't let 'im say a word until he had 'ad two pints.  He felt betterthen, and some o' the words 'e used surprised me."'Wot's to be done?' he ses at last.  'You see 'ow it is, Bill.'"'Can't you get 'im away?' I ses.  'Who is she, and wot's 'er name?'"'Her name,' ses the skipper, 'her name is Jane Maria Elizabeth Muffit,and she lives over at Rotherhithe.'"'She's very likely married already,' I ses."'Her 'usband died ten years ago,' ses the skipper; 'passed away in 'issleep.  Overlaid, I should say.'"He sat there smoking, and I sat there thinking.  Twice 'e spoke to me,and I held my 'and up and said 'H'sh.' Then I turned to 'im all of asudden and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped 'is beer."'Is Uncle Dick a nervous man?' I ses."'Nervous is no name for it,' he ses, staring."'Very good, then,' I ses.  'I'll send 'er husband to frighten 'im.'"The skipper looked at me very strange.  'Yes,' he ses.  'Yes.  Yes.'"'Frighten 'im out of 'is boots, and make him give 'er up,' I ses.  'Orbetter still, get 'im to run away and go into hiding for a time.  That'ud be best, in case 'e found out.'"'Found out wot?' ses the skipper."'Found out it wasn't 'er husband,' I ses."'Bill,' ses the skipper, very earnest, 'this is the fust beer I've 'adto-day, and I wish I could say the same for you.'"I didn't take 'im at fast, but when I did I gave a laugh that brought intwo more customers to see wot was the matter.  Then I took 'im by thearm--arter a little trouble--and, taking 'im back to the wharf, explainedmy meaning to 'im."'I know the very man,' I ses.  'He comes into a public-'ouse down my waysometimes.  Artful 'Arry, he's called, and, for 'arf-a-quid, say, he'dfrighten Uncle Dick 'arf to death.  He's big and ugly, and picks up aliving by selling meerschaum pipes he's found to small men wot don't want'em.  Wonderful gift o' the gab he's got.'"We went acrost to the 'Albion' to talk it over.  There's several barsthere, and the landlady always keeps cotton-wool in 'er ears, not 'avingbeen brought up to the public line.  The skipper told me all 'e knewabout Mrs. Muffit, and we arranged that Artful 'Arry should come down atseven o'clock next night, if so be as I could find 'im in time."I got up early the next arternoon, and as it 'appened, he came into the'Duke of Edinburgh' five minutes arter I got there.  Nasty temper 'e wasin, too.  He'd just found a meerschaum pipe, as usual, and the very fustman 'e tried to sell it to said that it was the one 'e lost lastChristmas, and gave 'im a punch in the jaw for it."'He's a thief, that's wot he is,' ses 'Arry; 'and I 'ate thiefs.  'Ow'sa honest tradesman to make a living when there's people like that about?'"I stood 'im 'arf a pint, and though it hurt 'im awful to drink it, hesaid 'ed 'ave another just to see if he could bear the pain.  Arter hehad 'ad three 'e began for to take a more cheerful view o' life, and toldme about a chap that spent three weeks in the London 'Orsepittle forcalling 'im a liar."'Treat me fair,' he ses, 'and I'll treat other people fair.  I neverbroke my word without a good reason for it, and that's more thaneverybody can say.  If I told you the praise I've 'ad from some peopleyou wouldn't believe it.'"I let 'im go on till he 'ad talked 'imself into a good temper, and then Itold 'im of the little job I 'ad got for 'im.  He listened quiet till I'ad finished, and then he shook 'is 'ead."'It ain't in my line,' he ses."'There's 'arf a quid 'anging to it,' I ses."'Arry shook his 'ead agin.  'Tain't enough, mate,' he ses.  'If you wasto make it a quid I won't say as I mightn't think of it.'"I 'ad told the skipper that it might cost 'im a quid, so I knew 'ow farI could go; and at last, arter 'Arry 'ad got as far as the door threetimes, I gave way."'And I'll 'ave it now,' he ses, 'to prevent mistakes.'"'No, 'Arry,' I ses, very firm.  'Besides, it ain't my money, you see.'"'You mean to say you don't trust me,' 'e ses, firing up."'I'd trust you with untold gold,' I ses, 'but not with a real quid;you're too fond of a joke, 'Arry.'"We 'ad another long argyment about it, and I had to tell 'im plain atlast that when I wanted to smell 'is fist, I'd say so."'You turn up at the wharf at five minutes to seven,' I ses, 'and I'llgive you ten bob of it; arter you've done your business I'll give you theother.  Come along quiet, and you'll see me waiting at the gate for you.'"He gave way arter a time, and, fust going 'ome for a cup o' tea, I wenton to the wharf to tell the skipper 'ow things stood."'It couldn't 'ave 'appened better,' he ses.  'Uncle Dick is sure to beaboard at that time, 'cos 'e's going acrost the water at eight o'clock topay 'er a visit.  And all the hands'll be away.  I've made sure of that.'"He gave me the money for Artful 'Arry in two 'arf-suverins, and then wewent over to the 'Albion' for a quiet glass and a pipe, and to wait forseven o'clock."I left 'im there at ten minutes to, and at five minutes to, punctual tothe minute, I see 'Arry coming along swinging a thick stick with a knobon the end of it."'Where's the 'arf thick-un?' he ses, looking round to see that the coastwas clear."I gave it to 'im, and arter biting it in three places and saying it wasa bit short in weight he dropped it in 'is weskit-pocket and said 'e wasready."I left 'im there for a minute while I went and 'ad a look round.  Thedeck of the Snipe was empty, but I could 'ear Uncle Dick down in thecabin singing; and, arter listening for a few seconds to make sure thatit was singing, I went back and beckoned to 'Arry."'He's down in the cabin,' I ses, pointing.  'Don't overdo it, 'Arry, andat the same time don't underdo it, as you might say.'"'I know just wot you want,' ses 'Arry, 'and if you'd got the 'art of aman in you, you'd make it two quids.'"He climbed on board and stood listening for a moment at the companion,and then 'e went down, while I went off outside the gate, so as to be outof earshot in case Uncle Dick called for me.  I knew that I should 'earall about wot went on arterwards--and I did."Artful 'Arry went down the companion-ladder very quiet, and then stoodat the foot of it looking at Uncle Dick.  He looked 'im up and down andall over, and then 'e gave a fierce, loud cough."'Good-evening,' he ses."'Good-evening,' ses Uncle Dick, staring at 'im.  'Did you want to seeanybody?'"'I did,' ses 'Arry.  'I do.  And when I see 'im I'm going to put my armsround 'im and twist 'is neck; then I'm going to break every bone in 'isbody, and arter that I'm going to shy 'im overboard to pison the fisheswith.'"'Dear me!' ses Uncle Dick, shifting away as far as 'e could."'I ain't 'ad a wink o' sleep for two nights,' ses 'Arry--'not ever sinceI 'eard of it.  When I think of all I've done for that woman-working for'er, and such-like-my blood boils.  When I think of her passing 'erselfoff as a widder--my widder--and going out with another man, I don't knowwot to do with myself.'"Uncle Dick started and turned pale.  Fust 'e seemed as if 'e was goingto speak, and then 'e thought better of it.  He sat staring at 'Arry asif 'e couldn't believe his eyes."'Wot would you do with a man like that?' ses 'Arry.  'I ask you, as manto man, wot would you do to 'im?'"'P'r'aps-p'r'aps 'e didn't know,' ses Uncle Dick, stammering."'Didn't know!' ses 'Arry.  'Don't care, you mean.  We've got a nicelittle 'ome, and, just because I've 'ad to leave it and lay low for a bitfor knifing a man, she takes advantage of it.  And it ain't the fusttime, neither.  Wot's the matter?'"'Touch-touch of ague; I get it sometimes,' ses Uncle Dick."'I want to see this man Finch,' ses 'Arry, shaking 'is knobby stick.'Muffit, my name is, and I want to tell 'im so.'"Uncle Dick nearly shook 'imself on to the floor."'I--I'll go and see if 'e's in the fo'c'sle,' he ses at last."'He ain't there, 'cos I've looked,' ses 'Arry, 'arf shutting 'is eyes andlooking at 'im hard.  'Wot might your name be?'"'My name's Finch,' ses Uncle Dick, putting out his 'ands to keep himoff; 'but I thought she was a widder.  She told me her 'usband died tenyears ago; she's deceived me as well as you.  I wouldn't ha' dreamt oftaking any notice of 'er if I'd known.  Truth, I wouldn't.  I should'ntha' dreamt of such a thing.'"Artful 'Arry played with 'is stick a little, and stood looking at 'imwith a horrible look on 'is face."''Ow am I to know you're speaking the truth?' he ses, very slow.  'Eh?'Ow can you prove it?'"'If it was the last word I was to speak I'd say the same,' ses UncleDick.  'I tell you, I am as innercent as a new-born babe.'"'If that's true,' ses 'Arry, 'she's deceived both of us.  Now, if I letyou go will you go straight off and bring her 'ere to me?'"'I will,' ses Uncle Dick, jumping up."''Arf a mo,' ses 'Arry, holding up 'is stick very quick.  'One thing is,if you don't come back, I'll 'ave you another day.  I can't make up mymind wot to do.  I can't think--I ain't tasted food for two days.  If I'ad any money in my pocket I'd 'ave a bite while you're gone.'"'Why not get something?' ses Uncle Dick, putting his 'and in his pocket,in a great 'urry to please him, and pulling out some silver."'Arry said 'e would, and then he stood on one side to let 'im pass, andeven put the knobby stick under 'im to help 'im up the companion-ladder."Uncle Dick passed me two minutes arterwards without a word, and set offdown the road as fast as 'is little legs 'ud carry 'im.  I watched 'imout o' sight, and then I went on board the schooner to see how 'Arry 'adgot on."Arry,' I ses, when he 'ad finished, 'you're a masterpiece!'"'I know I am,' he ses.  'Wot about that other 'arf-quid?'"'Here it is,' I ses, giving it to 'im.  'Fair masterpiece, that's wotyou are.  They may well call you Artful.  Shake 'ands.'"I patted 'im on the shoulder arter we 'ad shook 'ands, and we stoodthere smiling at each other and paying each other compliments."'Fancy 'em sitting 'ere and waiting for you to come back from thatbite,' I ses."'I ought to 'ave 'ad more off of him,' ses 'Arry.  ''Owever, it can't behelped.  I think I'll 'ave a lay down for a bit; I'm tired.'"'Better be off,' I ses, shaking my 'ead.  'Time passes, and they mightcome back afore you think.'"'Well, wot of it?' ses 'Arry."'Wot of it?' I ses.  'Why, it'ud spoil everything.  It 'ud be blueruin.'"'Are you sure?' ses 'Arry'."'Sartin,' I ses."'Well, make it five quid, and I'll go, then,' he ses, sitting down agin."I couldn't believe my ears at fust, but when I could I drew myself upand told 'im wot I thought of 'im; and he sat there and laughed at me."'Why, you called me a masterpiece just now,' he ses.  'I shouldn't bemuch of a masterpiece if I let a chance like this slip.  Why, I shouldn'tbe able to look myself in the face.  Where's the skipper?'"'Sitting in the "Albion",' I ses, 'arf choking."'Go and tell 'im it's five quid,' ses 'Arry.  'I don't mean five more,on'y four.  Some people would ha' made it five, but I like to deal squareand honest.'"I run over for the skipper in a state of mind that don't bear thinkingof, and he came back with me, 'arf crazy.  When we got to the cabin wefound the door was locked, and, arter the skipper 'ad told Artful wothe'd do to 'im if he didn't open it, he 'ad to go on deck and talk to 'imthrough the skylight."'If you ain't off of my ship in two twos,' he ses, 'I'll fetch apoliceman.'"'You go and fetch four pounds,' ses 'Arry; 'that's wot I'm waiting for,not a policeman.  Didn't the watchman tell you?'"'The bargain was for one pound,' ses the skipper, 'ardly able to speak."'Well, you tell that to the policeman,' ses Artful 'Arry."It was no use, he'd got us every way; and at last the skipper turns out'is pockets, and he ses, 'Look 'ere,' he ses, 'I've got seventeen andtenpence ha' penny.  Will you go if I give you that?'"''Ow much has the watchman got?' ses 'Arry.  'His lodger lost 'is pursethe other day.'"I'd got two and ninepence, as it 'appened, and then there was moretrouble because the skipper wouldn't give 'im the money till he 'ad gone,and 'e wouldn't go till he 'ad got it.  The skipper gave way at last, andas soon as he 'ad got it 'Arry ses, 'Now 'op off and borrer the rest, andlook slippy about it.'"I put one hand over the skipper's mouth fust, and then, finding that wasno good, I put the other.  It was no good wasting bad langwidge on 'Arry."I pacified the skipper at last, and arter 'Arry 'ad swore true 'e'd gowhen 'e'd got the money, the skipper rushed round to try and raise it.It's a difficult job at the best o' times, and I sat there on theskylight shivering and wondering whether the skipper or Mrs. Muffit wouldturn up fust."Hours seemed to pass away, and then I see the wicket in the gate open,and the skipper come through.  He jumped on deck without a word, andthen, going over to the skylight, 'anded down the money to 'Arry."'Right-o,' ses 'Arry.  'It on'y shows you wot you can do by trying.'"He unlocked the door and came up on deck, looking at us very careful,and playing with 'is stick."'You've got your money,' ses the skipper; 'now go as quick as you can.'"'Arry smiled and nodded at him.  Then he stepped on to the wharf and wasjust moving to the gate, with us follering, when the wicket opened and incame Mrs. Muffit and Uncle Dick."'There he is,' ses Uncle Dick.  'That's the man!'"Mrs. Muffit walked up to 'im, and my 'art a'most stopped beating.  Herface was the colour of beetroot with temper, and you could 'ave heard herbreath fifty yards away."'Ho!' she says, planting 'erself in front of Artful 'Arry, 'so you'rethe man that ses you're my 'usband, are you?'"'That's all right,' ses 'Arry, 'it's all a mistake.'"'MISTAKE?' ses Mrs. Muffit."'Mistake o' Bill's,' ses 'Arry, pointing to me.  'I told 'im I thought'e was wrong, but 'e would 'ave it.  I've got a bad memory, so I left itto 'im.'"'Ho!' ses Mrs. Muffit, taking a deep breath.  'Ho!  I thought as much.Wot 'ave you got to say for yourself--eh?'"She turned on me like a wild cat, with her 'ands in front of her.  I'vebeen scratched once in my life, and I wasn't going to be agin, so, fixingmy eyes on 'er, I just stepped back a bit, ready for 'er.  So long as Ikept my eye fixed on 'ers she couldn't do anything.  I knew that.Unfortunately I stepped back just a inch too far, and next moment I wentover back'ards in twelve foot of water."Arter all, p'r'aps it was the best thing that could have 'appened to me;it stopped her talking.  It ain't the fust time I've 'ad a wet jacket;but as for the skipper, and pore Uncle Dick--wot married her--they'vebeen in hot water ever since."End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Skilled Assistance, by W.W.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).

Neben ihrlehnte Gebhard, ein kraeftiger, etwa zehnjaehriger Junge; er sah nach demSchwesterchen, das so wohlig in der Mutter Armen ruhte, und wartetegespannt, ob es noch einmal gelaenge, das Laecheln hervorzuzaubern, dasvorhin wie ein Sonnenstrahl ueber das Kindergesichtchen gehuscht war. Alses gelang, sah er die Mutter beglueckt an und wandte sich lebhaft anseinen Vater: "Hast du es diesmal gesehen?"Nein, er hatte es wieder nicht gesehen, weil ihm etwas anderes nochanziehender war, als das erste Laecheln seines Toechterchens. Er hatte aufMutter und Sohn gesehen. Ihn freute, dass diese beiden sich so gutverstanden. Es war noch nicht lange her, dass er diese junge Frauheimgefuehrt hatte, nachdem seine erste Frau, Gebhards Mutter, gestorbenwar. Eine lange Reihe stiller Jahre hatte er mit dem Knaben verlebt, deneine treue Magd schlicht und streng erzog. Innig nah standen sich Vaterund Sohn, ernst und pflichttreu war der Foerster, anspruchslos der Junge.Kraeftig wuchs er in der frischen Waldluft heran und machte von seinemsechsten Lebensjahr an taeglich einen stundenlangen Weg, um auf einembenachbarten Gut an dem Unterricht mit den Knaben des Gutsbesitzersteilzunehmen. Auf diesem Weg begleitete ihn ein treuer Hund desFoersters, der schon immer sein Spielkamerad gewesen und jetzt seinBeschuetzer auf einsamen Waldwegen war.Bei einem Besuch seiner Mutter, die in Sueddeutschland lebte, hatte derFoerster das froehliche, liebevolle Maedchen kennen gelernt, das dann seinezweite Frau geworden war. Noch immer war's ihm wunderbar und erfreuteihn in tiefster Seele, dass solch ein neues Familienglueck in seinemForsthaus erblueht war; und so sah er auch jetzt mit Wonne auf die jungeFrau, ohne dass diese es bemerkte, denn sie war ganz von der Kleinenhingenommen.Jetzt stund sie auf und legte das Toechterchen sorgsam in den Korbwagen."So Juengferlein," sagte sie, "nach dieser grossen Leistung, nachdem duzweimal gelaechelt hast, wirst du herrlich schlafen, draussen am offenenFenster!" Sie fuhr sachte den Wagen in das Schlafzimmer.Gebhard wandte sich dem Vater zu. "Es ist so nett, wenn die Mutter"Juengferlein" sagt zu einem so kleinen Kind, hoerst du das nicht auch sogern, Vater? Ueberhaupt ist es jetzt so eine schoene Zeit! So soll's immerbleiben, wie es jetzt ist!"Stegemanns Gedanken wurden durch diesen Wunsch herausgerissen aus derfriedlichen Umgebung."Gebhard, du denkst nicht an den Krieg, sonst koenntest du nicht voneiner schoenen Zeit reden, die bleiben soll.""Aber wir siegen doch, und das gibt dann die allergroesste Freude.""Vorher werden viele Tausende von unsern deutschen Soldaten sterben!""Viele Tausende?" Gebhard wiederholte sinnend diese Worte und blieb eineWeile ganz nachdenklich. Dann aber trat er dicht an den Vater heran undbegann mit eifrigen Worten: "Das darf man doch nicht so traurig sagen,Vater? Die Soldaten ziehen doch gern in die Schlacht und wollen fuersVaterland sterben? Wenn ich nur schon aelter waere, und wenn du nochjuenger waerst, dann zoegen wir miteinander in den Krieg, du waerst einOffizier und ich dein liebster Soldat und wenn du befiehlst:'Freiwillige vor!' komme ich zu allererst. Aber mit zehn Jahren geht dasnoch nicht, und du, Vater, gelt du bist schon zu alt, du hast doch schonein wenig graue Haare!""Die grauen Haare machen nichts; vielleicht komme ich doch noch daran.Aber sei still, wir wollen damit der Mutter nicht angst machen."Sie sahen beide nach der Tuere, durch die die junge Frau eben wiederhereintrat. Es lag noch der Schimmer muetterlicher Zaertlichkeit auf ihremGesicht, als sie sagte: "Mein Juengferlein schlummert schon.""_Dein_ Juengferlein, Helene? Mir gehoert es auch!" Er zog seine Frauzaertlich an sich."Und ein wenig gehoert es auch mir, nicht, Mutter?""Freilich. Du wirst sehen, die kleinen Maedchen moegen die grossen Bruederam allerliebsten, lustig wird's, wenn sie erst mit dir spielen kann!"Das konnte sich nun Gebhard noch nicht recht vorstellen, aber lustigwar's ihm schon jetzt zumute und er sprang hinaus und hinunter in denHof, mit seinem Leo zu tollen, seinem liebsten Kameraden. Bald ging auchder Foerster, den sein Beruf oft halbe Tage lang abrief, und Helene blieballein.Der Forsthof lag einsam am Waldessaum, nahe der russischen Grenze; nurein paar Niederlassungen waren in der Naehe, von denen die eine demStrassenwaerter gehoerte, der die Grenzstrasse zu hueten hatte, die andereeinem alten Waldhueter, der mit seiner Familie da hauste. Sonst warenweit und breit keine menschlichen Ansiedelungen zu sehen, dunkler Waldnach allen Seiten und grosse Stille.Die da heimisch waren--wie der Foerster und sein Junge--, die liebtendiese Waldeinsamkeit, aber Fremden kam sie unheimlich vor. Auch Helene,als sie aus ihrer sueddeutschen Heimat, aus staedtischen Verhaeltnissenhieher versetzt worden war, hatte anfangs furchtsam nach demWaldesdunkel hinuebergeschaut und die Stille, waehrend ihres Mannes undGebhards Abwesenheit, hatte sie bedrueckt. Aber in ihren vier Waenden wares ihr doch bald wohl geworden, denn da war sie von ruehrender Liebe undVerehrung umgeben. Nicht nur Mann und Sohn, auch Knecht und Magd, jasogar die Hunde, vom grossen Kettenhund bis herunter zum kleinen Dackel,alle zeichneten sie aus, wie wenn sie sich immer daran freuten, dassetwas so feines, sonniges, froehliches in ihre Waldeinsamkeit gekommenwar. Und jetzt, seitdem sie Mutter geworden und ihr Kindchen jede Stundeum sich hatte, jetzt konnte das Gefuehl der Einsamkeit gar nicht mehraufkommen. Sie war voll Glueck und Wonne, ja so sehr, dass sie manchmaldas schwere Geschick des Vaterlandes fast vergass. Kam es ihr dann in denSinn, so machte sie sich im stillen Vorwuerfe, sagte sich: kannst du denngar nicht ungluecklich sein mit den vielen, die jetzt in Sorge undHerzeleid sind? Dann legte sie schnell das Tragroeckchen beiseite, dassie besticken wollte, nahm den groben Soldatenstrumpf zur Hand, setztesich neben den Kinderwagen, strickte und strickte, sah dabei auf daskleine Menschenknoespchen, das neben ihr schlummerte, und war eben widerWillen doch gluecklich. Aber der Krieg mit seinen Schrecken und Aengsten,mit Sorgen und Jammer kam bald genug, ihr Glueck zu stoeren.Zweites Kapitel.Es war eine stille Sommernacht zu Ende August, der Forsthof lagfriedlich, Mensch und Tiere hatten sich zur Ruhe begeben. Der Foersterallein war noch auf; die Zeitungen, die er diesen Abend erhalten hatte,lagen vor ihm. Sie sagten ihm, wie nahe die Gefahr eines feindlichenEinbruchs fuer das Grenzland war. Auch einen amtlichen Brief hatte er vonseiner vorgesetzten Behoerde erhalten, den Befehl, zunaechst noch aufseiner Stelle zu verharren."Zunaechst;" demnach konnte in Baelde die Anweisung kommen, den Forsthofzu verlassen. Darauf wollte er alles vorbereiten. Er ordnete Papiere undWertsachen, um im Notfall alles Wichtige rasch bei der Hand zu haben,und dann schrieb er an seine Mutter. Sie stand ihm sehr nahe, hattejedes Jahr in der Zeit seiner Vereinsamung die weite Reise vonSueddeutschland unternommen, um nach ihm und seinem mutterlosen Kleinenzu sehen. Bei ihr fragte er an, ob Frau und Kinder Zuflucht findenkoennten, wenn sie die Heimat verlassen muessten und er selbst sich demVaterland zur Verfuegung stellen wuerde. Er hatte einst gedient und es warihm selbstverstaendlich, dass er an dem grossen Kampf Teil nehmen wuerde,sobald ihn sein Amt im Forsthaus nicht mehr zurueck hielt.So sass er heute bis spaet in die Nacht hinein am Schreibtisch, waehrendseine Frau sorglos schlief. Er hatte ihr nichts mitgeteilt von seinenVorbereitungen. Sie kam ihm so jung und zart vor, besass nicht die starkeNatur, die er selbst von seiner Mutter geerbt hatte, schien so recht fuerGlueck und Sonnenschein geschaffen. Wie sie mit Schwerem zurecht kaeme,wie sie Leid und Entbehrungen ertragen wuerde, konnte er sich nichtvorstellen. So wollte er ihr keine Last auflegen, so lange er allein sietragen konnte.Mitternacht war es geworden, aber nun lagen auch alle Briefe undPapiere geordnet und ueberschrieben vor ihm. Er hatte getan was geschehenkonnte und griff nun nach dem Neuen Testament; denn es trieb ihn, einesvon den Jesusworten zu lesen, die ihm oft schon Kraft gegeben hatten."Nicht mein sondern dein Wille geschehe." Er versenkte sich in dieErzaehlung vom Kampf Jesu in Gethsemane.Ploetzlich wurde die Stille des Forsthofes gestoert durch das Bellen desHofhunds. Stegemann horchte auf, hoerte nichts, was den Hund beunruhigthaben konnte. Aber das Bellen wurde lauter und auch die andern Hundetaten mit. Stegemann oeffnete das Fenster, schaute hinaus in die stilleSommernacht, ging dann hinunter in den umzaeunten Hof, rief die Hunde,die unwillig knurrten, zur Ruhe und lauschte. Jetzt unterschied auchsein Ohr das Geraeusch von sich naehernden schweren Tritten draussen aufder Landstrasse. Wer kam da bei Nacht? War es Freund oder Feind? Ihmahnte nichts Gutes. Er eilte rasch ins Haus zurueck und nahm den Revolverzu sich. Auch den Knecht wollte er rufen; der war aber durch das Gebellschon wach geworden und trat mit der Laterne in der Hand zum Foerster."Wenn's Russen sind, dann gnad uns Gott!" sagte der Knecht."Mach die Kettenhunde los; sie lassen keinen ueber den Zaun."--Wuetend bellten die zwei grossen losgelassenen Hunde und liefen aufgeregtam Zaun hin und her. Von aussen am geschlossenen Hoftor ertoente dieGlocke. Herr und Knecht sahen sich an. Wie aus einem Munde riefen sie:"Russen sind das nicht, die klingeln nicht, die schlagen mit dem Kolbenan."Der Foerster trat naeher."Wer ist draussen?" rief er. Und gut deutsch klang die Antwort:"Preussische Infanteristen mit einem Befehl an den Foerster."Noch ein paar Fragen und Antworten wurden zu groesserer Sicherheitgewechselt. Dann rief der Foerster dem Knecht zu: "Mach die Hunde fest."Erst als die aufgeregten Tiere angekettet waren, konnte man wagen, dasHoftor zu oeffnen und die Soldaten einzuladen, die draussen harrten. EinePatrouille von fuenf Maennern war es, angefuehrt von einem jungen Leutnant.Statt der gefuerchteten Feinde unverhofft einen Trupp wackerer Feldgrauerauf dem einsamen Forsthof zu haben, das war ein Hochgefuehl, vor allemauch fuer die geaengstigte junge Frau, die wie auch Gebhard vom Laerm derHunde erwacht war und mit dem Knaben am Fenster stehend den Vorgang imHof beobachtet hatte."Preussen sind's, Preussen!" rief Gebhard, der zuerst beim Laternenscheindie Uniform erkannte."Wirklich! Gott Lob und Dank," antwortete die Mutter und machte sich infliegender Eile zurecht, um die unverhofften Gaeste zu begruessen und fuersie zu sorgen. Aber noch ehe sie so weit war, suchte ihr Mann sie auf."Ich komme schon," rief sie ihm eifrig entgegen, "wollen die Soldatenbei uns uebernachten? Soll ich Betten richten?""Das nicht, sie halten nur kurze Rast; dann geht ihr Marsch weiter undich, ich muss sie begleiten.""In der Nacht? Wohin?""Das darf ich dir nicht sagen; es ist eine Vertrauenssache, ein geheimerBefehl, von dem auch nur der Offizier weiss.""Wie unheimlich, Rudolf! Wann kommst du wohl wieder?""Vielleicht schon in ein paar Stunden.--Wenn du nur schnell helfenwolltest, Tee fuer die Leute zu machen. Die Soldaten haben schon Auftragerhalten, den Herd zu heizen und Wasser aufzusetzen.""Die Soldaten heizen unsern Herd? Das muss ich sehen. Komm, Gebhard, geh'mit mir hinunter! Ich habe noch nie Soldaten kochen sehen. Mit fuenfKoechen, das muss ja schnell gehen!"Ja, nach zehn Minuten war der Tee auf dem Tisch und nach weiteren zehnMinuten war gegessen und getrunken, was eiligst aufgetragen worden; unddie fuenf Mann bedankten sich bei der jungen, froehlichen Foerstersfrau.Der Foerster mit Flinte und Jagdhund sah aus, als wenn er auf die Jagdginge. Im letzten Augenblick nahm er seine Frau beiseite: "BehalteKnecht und Magd bei dir, stelle dich aengstlich, rufe sie herein, lass sieTee trinken. Ich will nicht, dass uns jemand folgt. Kein Mensch sollwissen, in welcher Richtung wir gehen."Er gab rasch seiner jungen Frau einen Abschiedskuss--das war nichtsbesonderes; aber dass er im Vorbeigehen auch Gebhard einen Kuss gab, daskam dem Kind sehr verwunderlich vor, denn Zaertlichkeiten waren zwischenVater und Sohn nicht ueblich.--"Wegen ein paar Stunden Trennung kuesst man sich doch nicht?" sagte sichGebhard und war sehr nachdenklich, waehrend er in sein Schlafzimmer ging,um sich wieder zu legen. Zum erstenmal waren Soldaten ins Haus gekommen;der Offizier hatte mit dem Vater Kriegsgeheimnisse besprochen, die keinanderer Mensch erfahren durfte. Ein wenig unheimlich war die Sache, aberdoch sehr spannend. Heute Nacht war der Krieg ins eigene Haus gedrungen,jetzt erst fing er so recht an fuer Gebhard.Und die junge Mutter konnte, nachdem sie Knecht und Magd entlassen,lange nicht wieder den Schlaf finden. An der Seite ihres Mannes hattesie noch nie den Krieg gefuerchtet; aber ohne ihn ueberkam sie eine grosseAngst. Es war so finster, so still und schwuel. Vielleicht konnte siebesser schlafen, wenn sie die Tuere aufmachte ins Nebenzimmer, zuGebhard. Sie tat es leise, um ihn nicht zu wecken, und freute sich doch,als sie bemerkte, dass er noch nicht schlief."Bist du es, Mutter?" rief er und richtete sich ganz munter auf."Ja, es ist so schwuel; ich will die Tuere ein wenig offen lassen.""Das ist nett, dann koennen wir plaudern. Ich moechte so gerne erraten,warum der Vater mit den Soldaten gegangen ist. Aber vielleicht ist esbesser, wenn wir es nicht erraten; weil es doch ein Kriegsgeheimnis ist.Nur der Vater darf es wissen; er muss stolz darauf sein. Ich waere auchstolz darauf und wuerde das Kriegsgeheimnis niemand verraten; ausservielleicht dir, Mutter. Oder darf ich's auch dir nicht verraten?""Du weisst es ja gar nicht, Gebhard," sagte die Mutter und lachtefroehlich. Die Luft kam ihr schon nicht mehr schwuel vor; und baldschliefen Mutter und Sohn ebenso ruhig wie das Kindchen im Korbwagen undahnten so wenig wie dieses, dass sie zum letzten Mal im Forsthausschliefen.Am Morgen des folgenden Tages kam, angestrengt von langem, eiligemMarsch, Stegemann zurueck. Nach der schlaflosen Nacht sollte er sich miteinem guten Fruehstueck staerken und die verlorene Nachtruhe nachholen, daswar der Wunsch seiner jungen Frau; ungesaeumt wollte sie fuer seineBewirtung sorgen. Er aber hielt sie zurueck: "Das ist jetzt Nebensache,"sagte er eilig, "wir haben viel Wichtigeres zu tun. Leutnant N. riet mirdringend, heute noch mit Frau und Kind und, soweit moeglich, mit Hab undGut abzuziehen. Erschrick nicht so, Liebste, die Strasse ist noch freivon Feinden; aber wir wollen auch gar keine Zeit verlieren. Jetzt giltes aufpacken, was das Noetigste und Wertvollste ist, um so schnell es nurirgend geht, an die Bahn zu kommen. Ich sage gleich den Leuten, siesollen helfen, auch sie muessen fliehen. Es kann sein, dass die Russen derSpur der Patrouille folgen, die heute nacht hier war. Nun, Gebhard,hilf der Mutter!"In wenigen Minuten war der stille Forsthof erfuellt von laermendem,hastigem Treiben. Der Knecht fuhr den Wagen vor und lud auf, was ihmzugereicht wurde: Betten, Kleider, Waesche, auch allerlei Vorraete ausKueche und Kammer. Gebhard lief aus und ein, fast froehlich in dereifrigen Taetigkeit. Knecht und Magd trugen ihre Buendel herbei.Keine halbe Stunde war verflossen; da suchte der Foerster seine Frau auf,die an ihrem Waescheschrank stand und trieb zur Abfahrt: "Es ist genug,lass alles andere, wir fahren!"Ganz erstaunt schaute sie auf: "Dass du so aengstlich bist! Auf eineViertelstunde kommt es doch nicht an; die kleine Aussteuer vomJuengferlein--" sie unterbrach sich: "Horch!" Die Hunde bellten, derFoerster eilte ans Fenster. Er wandte sich sofort wieder zurueck: "Es istschon zu spaet," sagte er, "die Russen kommen!"Er sprach ruhig; aber sein Gesicht verlor alle Farbe. Auch seine Frautrat ans Fenster und fuhr erschreckt zurueck: "Um Gottes willen, wassollen wir tun?" rief sie in Todesangst."Geh da hinein und schliesse dich ein!" rief ihr Mann. Er fasste sieschnell, drueckte sie an sein Herz, kuesste sie stuermisch und fuehrte sie indas Schlafzimmer zu ihrer Kleinen."Gott behuete euch," rief er, "schliesse zu!"Sie schob den Riegel vor.In diesem Augenblick kam Gebhard atemlos: "Vater, russische Reiter sindim Hof, sie fragen nach dem Foerster. Was wollen sie denn von dir?"Herr Stegemann zog sein Kind leidenschaftlich an sich: "Sie wollenvielleicht wissen, wohin unsere Soldaten heute nacht gegangen sind.""Aber das darfst du ihnen doch nicht sagen?""Nein.""Was wird dann, Vater?""Was Gott will."Der Anfuehrer der russischen Truppe, die aus etwa 15 Mann bestand, tratin das Zimmer, den Revolver in der Hand; einige seiner Leute folgten,andere hielten Wacht an der Tuere. Es kam, wie der Foerster vorausgesehen.Der russische Offizier wollte wissen, wohin die deutsche Patrouille,deren Spur sie gefunden hatten, gezogen sei. Offenbar war seine Absicht,ihr zu folgen, sie abzufangen, ehe sie ihren Zweck erfuellen und ueberihre Erkundung den Deutschen Nachricht geben konnte. Ein polnischerWaldarbeiter hatte ihm verraten, dass der Foerster die Patrouille gefuehrthatte. Und nun sollte er die Feinde fuehren, die zu Pferd die deutschenFussgaenger leicht einholen wuerden.Der Foerster, die Rechte auf den Tisch gestuetzt, hoerte die Forderung.Fest klang seine Antwort: "Sucht sie selbst. Ihr koennt vom deutschenMann nicht verlangen, dass er die Deutschen verrate."Neben dem Vater stand Gebhard mit gluehenden Wangen. Wie ein Helderschien ihm der Vater, da er dem russischen Offizier kurz und fest denDienst verweigerte.Der Russe aber lachte hoehnisch, im Gefuehl der Uebermacht: "Sie sind einTor. Wollen Sie nicht, so sind Sie mit Weib und Kind in 5 Minutenniedergemacht."Tief aufatmend antwortete der Foerster: "Ich werde nicht zum Verraeter."Dem Offizier stieg der Zorn auf, aber ihm lag daran, einen willigenFuehrer zu gewinnen, so bezwang er sich. "Nehmen Sie Vernunft an," sagteer. "Sie entschuldigt die Not. Sie sind machtlos in unseren Haenden.Entschliessen Sie sich rasch, dass uns die kostbare Zeit nicht verlorengeht. Dann sollen Sie, auf Offiziersehre, unversehrt zurueckkehren,sobald wir die Deutschen erreicht und noch ehe sie Sie gesehen haben.Weib und Kind koennen Sie in Sicherheit bringen, Ihr Hab und Gut sollunberuehrt bleiben."Der Foerster schwieg."Vater, tu's nicht!" rief Gebhard leidenschaftlich. Der Offizier wandtesich heftig gegen den Knaben, packte ihn, schob ihn beiseite und rief:"Der soll der erste sein, der vor Ihren Augen erstochen wird, wenn Sienicht augenblicklich folgen."--"Haltet den Buben!" befahl er denSoldaten. Die ergriffen Gebhard mit rauher Hand. Wuetend setzte er sichzur Wehr; doch sie packten ihn so fest, dass er kein Glied mehr ruehrenkonnte; aber das konnten sie nicht hindern, dass er immer lauter rief:"Vater, tu's nicht!"Der Foerster biss die Zaehne aufeinander; noch schien er unentschlossen.Aber in diesem Augenblick wurde der Tuerriegel des Nebenzimmerszurueckgeschoben und unter der halbgeoeffneten Tuere erschien seine Frau.Ihr junges, rosiges Gesicht war totenblass; sie hatte gehoert, was dieMaenner verhandelten und wusste, dass ihr Leben und das von Mann undKindern auf dem Spiel stand. Bebend vor Angst wagte sie nicht, dieSchwelle zu ueberschreiten, hielt die Tuerklinke in der Hand und riefihrem Mann flehend zu: "Ich bitte dich um Gottes Willen, rette uns, odenke an die Kinder!"Der Russe nahm seinen Vorteil wahr. Er gruesste die Dame des Hauses: "Ja,gnaedige Frau, sprechen Sie Ihrem Gemahl zu. Geht er mit uns, so moegenSie unbehelligt von hier fliehen, und Ihr Mann wird in kurzer Zeitnachfolgen, auf Offiziersehre. Tut er es nicht, so gebe ich Sie meinenSoldaten preis."Schaudernd zog sich die geaengstigte Frau vor den Blicken der rohenSoldaten zurueck."Ich gehe!" laut und fest sagte es der Foerster und wandte sich der Tuerezu."Vater, tu's nicht!" Noch einmal kam der Ruf von Gebhard, der noch immerumklammert war von harten Soldatenfaeusten.Der Vater wandte sich an den Offizier: "Lassen Sie mein Kind frei, nachIhrem Ehrenwort."Ein Wink des Offiziers und die Soldaten liessen den Knaben los; aber siedraengten sich zwischen ihn und den Foerster und liessen die beiden nichtzueinander kommen. Nur konnten sie nicht verhindern, dass ein letzterBlick vom Vater zum Sohn ging, ein Blick voll Liebe und Stolz."Vorwaerts!" befahl der Offizier.Sie verliessen das Zimmer; Gebhard rannte nach der Schlafzimmertuere, diewieder verriegelt war. "Mach auf, Mutter, sie sind fort!" und ausser sichvor Zorn und Jammer rief er. "Der Vater ist doch mit ihnen gegangen!Jetzt muss er die Deutschen verraten!"Helene war erschuettert durch die Verzweiflung des Knaben. Sie versuchteihn zu troesten, zog ihn in muetterlicher Zaertlichkeit an sich: "Der Vaterkommt morgen schon zurueck, der Offizier hat's auf Ehre versprochen.Sieh, wenn er nicht nachgegeben haette, waeren wir alle umgebracht worden.Er hat mitgehen muessen, er hat doch nicht anders gekonnt!""Aber der Vater darf doch die Deutschen nicht verraten," schluchzte dasKind."Denke nicht mehr _daran_. Denke, dass wir jetzt alle grausam misshandeltund getoetet wuerden. Gott Lob, dass der Vater uns davor behuetet hat."Gebhard konnte sich nicht fassen, zornig stampfte er und rief: "DerVater darf doch kein Verraeter sein!"Die Mutter sah den Knaben starr an: "Hast du kein Herz fuer den Vater,fuer mich und fuer unsere Kleine? Wolltest du, wir waeren grausamhingemetzelt, du und wir alle?"Heftig antwortete Gebhard: "Ja, ja, viel lieber moechte ich das."Der Mutter graute. Sie konnte das Kind nicht verstehen, und war imtiefsten Herzen gekraenkt durch seine Antwort. Aber weiter mit ihm zureden war nicht moeglich; denn unter der Tuere erschien die Magd,schreckensbleich mit verweinten Augen: "Der Knecht sagt, wir muesseneilen, dass wir fortkommen, der Herr hat's ihm noch zugerufen. Unserarmer, armer Herr, sie haben ihn fortgefuehrt! Auf einem Russenpferd,mitten unter den Feinden ganz allein! Und er hat sich noch so tapferumgeschaut, so todesmutig ist er davon geritten! Der arme Herr, waswerden sie mit ihm tun?"Helene hatte auf den Lippen zu sagen: "Es geschieht ihm nichts, morgenwird er uns nachkommen;" aber sie unterdrueckte die Worte. Die Leutedurften nicht wissen, dass der Herr sich bereit erklaert hatte, mit denFeinden zu gehen. Schwer fiel ihr auf die Seele: Kein Deutscher durftedas je erfahren. Es war ja Verrat, was ihr Mann beging. Ihr zuliebe tater's; nicht aus Angst ums eigene Leben, der tapfere, treue Mann! Wiewollte sie ihm das danken ihr Leben lang!Die Magd mahnte noch einmal zur Eile. "Was ist noch aufzuladen?" Hastiggriff Helene nach diesem und jenem, beladen eilte die Magd die Treppehinunter, rief Gebhard zur Hilfe; wie im Traum nahm er, was ihmhingereicht wurde. Die Mutter aber suchte in Eile nach einem BlattPapier, sie musste ihm noch ein Wort schreiben, das sollte er finden,wenn er in sein veroedetes Haus zurueckkaeme, mit einer schweren Last aufdem Gewissen, einer Last, die er ihr zuliebe durchs ganze Leben tragenmusste. In fliegender Eile schrieb sie mit zitternder Hand: "Komm bald zumir, herzliebster Schatz, hab tausendmal Dank, dass Du uns das Lebengerettet hast!" Mitten auf den Tisch legte sie das Blatt, dann nochdaneben, was ihn staerken sollte, Brot und eine Flasche Wein. Wieder kamdie Magd unter die Tuere: "Jetzt ist angespannt.""Ich komme!" Sie nahm ihr Kindchen, das liebevoll eingehuellte. Die Magdbemerkte Brot und Wein, wollte beides mitnehmen. Helene liess sie nichtan den Tisch. "Das bleibt!" rief sie."Kein Wunder, dass die arme, junge Frau ganz verwirrt ist," dachte dasMaedchen.Im Hof war alles zur Flucht bereit. Die Hunde sprangen um den Wagen. Siesollten mitlaufen bis zum Haus des Strassenwaerters, meinte der Knecht,der solle sie aufnehmen. "Aber Leo gebe ich nicht her, den nehme ichmit!" erklaerte Gebhard. Der Knecht machte Einwendungen. Unmoeglich seidas auf der langen Reise, bei den ueberfuellten Zuegen. Ein Unverstand waerees. Die Mutter sah ein, dass er recht hatte, aber sie wusste auch, was esfuer Gebhard bedeutete, sich von seinem Leo zu trennen. Der Vater hatteihm vor Jahresfrist das junge Tier geschenkt; ihm gelehrt, es zubehandeln; zu einem folgsamen, anhaenglichen Kameraden war esherangewachsen und von seinem kleinen Herrn unzertrennlich gewesen. Auchjetzt standen sie dicht beisammen, Gebhard und sein Hund, sahen sich anund das kluge Tier schien zu merken, dass ueber sein Schicksal entschiedenwurde. Ein ungewohntes, kurzes Bellen gab es von sich.Die Mutter wandte sich an den Knecht. "Wir wollen es doch versuchen, obwir Leo mitnehmen koennen!""O ja, bitte, Mutter!"Der Wagen setzte sich in Bewegung. Das Toechterlein auf der Mutter Schoss,weich gebettet, schlief sanft ein. Gebhard sass der Mutter gegenueber. Siehielten bald bei dem Strassenwaerter, dann ging die Fahrt weiter, der Bahnzu. Laengs der Strasse zog sich der Wald hin, aus dem jeden Augenblick dieFeinde auftauchen und die Wehrlosen ueberfallen konnten. Und in denHaenden dieser Feinde war der geliebte Mann, der treue Vater."Gebhard," sagte die Mutter leise, dass es der Knecht auf dem Bock nichthoere, "Gebhard, du hast doch auch gehoert, dass der russische Offiziergesagt hat: 'auf Offiziersehre.'""Ja. Zweimal hat er das gesagt.""Solch ein Schwur wird doch sicher auch im Krieg gehalten," sagte Heleneund fuegte bei: "Also kommt der Vater sicher morgen oder spaetestensuebermorgen. Wenn es nur schon morgen waere!"Gebhard wandte sich ab und sagte kein Wort darauf. Mit festgeschlossenem Mund sah er durchs Fenster.Die Stille bedrueckte die Mutter. Sie redete ihn nach einer Weile wiederan: "Warum bist du so still, Gebhard? Hast du Angst, dass die Russen ausdem Wald kommen? Wir sind jetzt schon nahe der Station, hier ist's nichtmehr so gefaehrlich.""Ich habe keine Angst.""Hast du Heimweh nach dem Forsthof? Nach dem Frieden kommen wir allewieder zurueck."Aber Gebhard schwieg und die Mutter sah wohl, dass er kaempfte, dieTraenen zurueckzuhalten, die ihm in die Augen kamen.Sie streckte die Hand nach ihm aus. "Komm, setze dich neben mich,Gebhard; komm her zu mir, sage mir, was dir so traurig ist. Der Vaterkommt uns doch morgen nach."Nun kam es unter lautem Schluchzen bebend heraus: "Ich kann mich janicht auf den Vater freuen. Ich kann jetzt doch den Vater nie mehr liebhaben und habe ihn doch so lieb!"Helene erschrak in tiefster Seele. Sie selbst war so voll Liebe undSehnsucht nach ihrem Mann, sie hatte das innigste Verlangen nach ihm undGebhard, sein geliebter Bub, sprach solche Worte!"Wie darfst du so reden, Gebhard," rief sie erregt, "wo er doch allesnur uns zuliebe getan hat. Er konnte ja auch gar nicht anders!""Doch, Mutter, weisst du nicht mehr? Zuerst hat er ganz fest nein gesagt;aber dann hast du die Tuere aufgemacht und hast gerufen 'rette uns'. Dannhat dich der Vater angesehen. O haettest du doch die Tuere nichtaufgemacht, dann waere der Vater kein Verraeter!"Die Mutter erblasste und liess seine Hand los. Nach einer kleinen Weilesagte sie in einem ernsten, fremden Ton: "Wenn der Vater zurueckkommt, sosage so etwas nie zu ihm, sonst machst du ihn ganz ungluecklich. Niesollst du zu irgend jemand wieder so reden!" Dann wandte sie sich ab under fuehlte, dass es ihr jetzt lieb waere, wenn er nicht neben ihr saesse,ging auf seinen ersten Platz zurueck und dachte: "Die Mutter kann michjetzt nicht mehr lieben und ich kann den Vater nicht mehr lieb haben,alles, was schoen war, ist vorueber." Er sass wieder an seinemFensterplatz, Wald war nicht mehr zu sehen, unbekanntes Land, alles,alles anders.Eine Stunde darnach langten sie an der Station an, waren bald im aergstenGewuehl, hatten aber noch die Hilfe von Knecht und Magd, die erst spaeterin anderer Richtung abfahren konnten. Am Schalter draengten sich dieLeute. Helene verlangte Karten fuer sich und Gebhard. "Und eineHundekarte.""Das gibt's jetzt nicht.""Darf er mit in den Personenwagen?""Keine Rede. Wir sind froh, wenn wir die Menschen unterbringen. Weiter!"Helene wurde von den Nachdraengenden ungeduldig weggeschoben.Was war nun zu tun mit Leo? Der Knecht troestete Gebhard, versprach ihm,den Hund gut unterzubringen. Und Gebhard sah ein, dass es nicht anderssein konnte; die Reisenden umdraengten Mutter und Kinder, im Strom wurdensie fortgeschoben, keine Zeit zum Abschiednehmen von den treuenDienstboten, auch nicht von dem geliebten Hund. Ein Winseln hoerteGebhard noch--er wusste, das galt ihm.Eingepfercht in den Wagen sassen unsere Fluechtlinge, mit Muehe hatten sienoch Sitzplaetze erlangt. Immer mehr Reisende draengten herein. Gebhardsah durchs Fenster in das Gewuehl. Endlich leerte sich der Bahnsteig,das Zeichen zur Abfahrt wurde gegeben und eben in diesem Augenblick sahGebhard ploetzlich noch einmal seinen Leo auftauchen. Er hatte sich vonder Hand des Knechts losgerissen, raste auf den Wagen zu, aus demGebhard sah, sprang blitzschnell auf und ueber alle Hindernisse hinwegzwischen scheltenden Menschen hindurch bis in das Abteil, wo er sichsofort unter den Sitz seines kleinen Herrn duckte und so fuer sich selbstdie Frage loeste, ob Hunde mitfahren duerften.Gebhard war so ausser sich vor Freude, dass auch Helene, die zuerst ueberden Eindringling erschrocken war, freundlich dem Tier zunickte, das ihrgegenueber unter dem Sitz aengstlich hervorsah, nicht ganz sicher, ob esgeduldet wuerde. Allerdings versuchte auch ein Herr Einsprache zuerheben. "Es gehoert sich nicht, dass solch ein grosser Hund in den Wagengenommen wird." Aber ein aelterer Mann ergriff Partei fuer das Tier odermehr noch fuer die Familie."Freilich gehoert sich's nicht," bemerkte er, "aber es gehoert sich auchnicht, dass so ein junges Frauchen mit dem kleinen Kind fluechten muss. Undum eine Flucht wird sich's wohl handeln. Nach Vergnuegungsreisenden sehensie nicht aus. Habe ich's erraten?"Helene konnte nur gegen Traenen ankaempfend mit unsicherer Stimme bejahen."Nun also; dann wird Ihnen auch niemand den Hund absprechen; so eintreues Tier ist auch ein Schutz."So blieb der Hund unbeanstandet und bewaehrte sich auf der Fahrt alskluges Tier. "Hast du bemerkt, Mutter, wie Leo so schlau ist und sichstill haelt, wenn der Schaffner hereinkommt?" fragte Gebhard.Nein, Helene hatte das nicht beachtet. Sie sass in schwere Gedankenversunken. Zuerst hatte nur die Sorge sie bedrueckt, ob auch gewiss dergeliebte Mann morgen zurueckkaeme. Allmaehlich aber legte sich ihr schweraufs Herz der Gedanke, dass er wohl zurueckkommen koennte, aber mit einerSchuld auf dem Gewissen, die nie, nie mehr zu tilgen war. Wenn schonGebhard diesen Verrat so tief empfand, wieviel mehr sein Vater! Und dazuhatte _sie_ ihn veranlasst! Sein ganzes Leben hatte sie verdorben!Und nun kamen noch andere schwere Ueberlegungen. Sie konnte sich nichtentschliessen--wie es ihres Mannes Wunsch gewesen--zu seiner Mutter zugehen. Diese war eine tapfere aber auch strenge Frau. Helene fuehltenicht den Mut, ihr zu erzaehlen, was vorgefallen war, und es kam ihrunmoeglich vor, ihr unter die Augen zu treten. So ueberlegte sie undbeschloss, bei ihrem Bruder Zuflucht zu suchen. Er und seine Frau hattensich schon bei Kriegsausbruch freundlich erboten, Helene mit demToechterchen aufzunehmen. Damals hatte sie sich nicht von ihrem Mannetrennen wollen. Jetzt war es anders. Sie wollte dorthin, aber wohinwuerde ihr Mann sich wenden?In diesen Gedanken hatte Gebhards Frage sie unterbrochen. Nun sah er dieMutter aufmerksam an und seinem teilnehmenden Blick fiel auf, wieveraendert sie aussah. Sie hatte doch immer so helle Augen gehabt undeinen froehlichen Mund. Nun waren die Augen truebe und der Mund zuckte wievon verhaltenem Schmerz. Gebhard dachte an seinen Vater. Wenn der jetzterschiene, ja dann wuerde die Mutter wieder so strahlend aussehen wiesonst. Gerne haette er das auch so zustande gebracht wie der Vater, aberdas konnte er nicht; im Gegenteil: dass sie so veraendert aussah, war wohlseine Schuld; seit dem Gespraech im Wagen war sie so still. Er haettevielleicht das nicht sagen sollen, was er gesagt hatte. Was konnte eraber jetzt machen? Lauter fremde Leute sassen herum, man konnte garnichts Liebes zu der Mutter sagen. Eine ganze Weile blieb er still undnachdenklich, aber auf einmal kam ihm, was er suchte. "Mutter, unserJuengferlein schlaeft so sanft, sieh nur, wie rosig ihre Baeckchen sind!"Die Mutter blickte auf das Kind, streichelte die weichen Baeckchen, aberdabei fuellten sich ihre Augen mit Traenen.Auch das Juengferlein konnte die Freude nicht hervorlocken? Ja, dannwusste Gebhard keinen Rat. Es ging eben nicht ohne den Vater!Drittes Kapitel.Im Verlauf der langen, muehseligen Reise erfuhr Gebhard, dass nicht derGrossmutter Haus das Reiseziel sein sollte; in der Mutter Heimat, beiOnkel und Tante Kurz, sollten sie ihre Zuflucht suchen. Es war eineEnttaeuschung fuer ihn; die Grossmutter kannte und liebte er, dieVerwandten der Mutter waren ihm fremd. Helene suchte ihm Lust zu machen."Onkel und Tante haben uns laengst eingeladen; sie koennen uns vielleichter aufnehmen als die Grossmutter; sie haben ein eigenes Landhausvor der Stadt, mit einem Garten; du wirst sehen, dass wir's gut bei ihnenhaben.""Aber wenn der Vater zurueckkommt, der wird uns bei der Grossmuttersuchen!""Wir schreiben der Grossmutter, wo wir sind!""Kommt dann der Vater zu uns, weiss er, wo das ist?""Aber freilich weiss er das, Gebhard. Bei meinem Bruder und seiner Frauwar ja unsere Hochzeit, dort hat mich der Vater geholt, weil ich keineEltern mehr habe. Mein Bruder hat mich auch so lieb, weisst du, fast wiewenn ich sein Kind waere. Er ist viel aelter als ich." Gebhard ueberlegte."Ja, dann kann ich das schon begreifen, dass du zu ihm moechtest."Seufzend ergab er sich.Nach manchem unfreiwilligen Aufenthalt und schier unertraeglicher Fahrtkam Helene mit den beiden Kindern am spaeten Abend an ihremBestimmungsort an. Wohl hatte sie ihr Kommen angekuendigt, aber Tag undStunde voraus anzugeben, war in dieser Zeit unmoeglich. So stand sie nunin dunkler Nacht, mit den uebermuedeten Kindern, mit dem Hund und vielemGepaeck auf dem Bahnsteig, und wusste nicht, wie sie nun bis in ihresBruders Haus kommen sollte. Alles an dem Bahnhof hatte ein anderesAussehen als frueher. Befremdet sah Helene um sich. Sie hatte nichtgedacht, dass auch auf dem Bahnhof dieser kleineren Stadt die Kriegszeitsich so bemerklich machte. An ihr vorbei eilte eine weibliche Gestalt ingrosser, weisser Schuerze, am Aermel mit dem Roten Kreuz gezeichnet. EinenEimer heissen Tee am Arm ging sie von Wagen zu Wagen und bot dendurchreisenden Soldaten die Labung an. Einer derselben, einLandwehrmann, lehnte dankend ab. "Wir haben erst in der vorigen StationTee bekommen, aber wenn Sie sich um die junge Frau mit den Kindern dadrueben annehmen wollten, die haben mich schon lang gedauert, sie sindaus ihrer Heimat vertrieben!"Die Helferin wandte sich nach der bezeichneten Stelle, sah die hilfloseGruppe und ging sofort darauf zu. "Reihen Sie noch weiter, kann ichIhnen helfen?" frug sie Helene. Aber als sie dicht voreinander standen,erkannten sich die beiden Frauen. Sie waren einst zusammen in die Schulegegangen."Ich habe dich gar nicht gleich erkannt, Helene; ist das dein Kindchen?Hast du allein reisen muessen? Dein Mann ist wohl einberufen? Du Aermste,du siehst so angegriffen aus. Wirst du nicht abgeholt? Nein? Warte nurein klein wenig, ich helfe dir. Sieh, dort ist eine Bank, setzt eucheinstweilen!" Sie eilte wieder an den Zug, da und dort wurde sieangerufen und um Tee gebeten.Ein blutjunger Freiwilliger reichte eine Postkarte heraus, bat, manmoechte ihm die Liebe erweisen, sie einzuwerfen, weil seine Mutter sichgar so sehr um ihn sorge. So war sie voller Taetigkeit, bis der Zugwieder davon fuhr. Dann aber eilte sie zu der kleinen Gruppe muederMenschen, die auf sie harrten, und es gelang ihr, einen Wagen fuer sieaufzutreiben und sie samt Gepaeck und Hund gluecklich darinunterzubringen. "Zu Fabrikant Kurz," lautete die Anweisung fuer denKutscher.Die Fahrt ging durch dunkle Strassen, denn an den Laternen wurde gespartin dieser Kriegszeit. Fast Mitternacht war es, bis sie am Haus hielten,aber doch war ein Fenster noch erleuchtet und wurde bei dem Anfahren desWagens geoeffnet. "Wer kommt?" rief eine Stimme von oben. "Wir sind's,Bruder!"Einen Augenblick spaeter wurde die Haustuere geoeffnet und der Bruder,Fabrikant Kurz, hiess seine naechtlichen Gaeste willkommen. "Verzeih, dasswir euch so spaet bei Nacht ins Haus fallen," sagte Helene, "es liess sichnicht aendern.""Es ist fuer mich nicht spaet, ich habe jetzt oft bis in die Nacht hineinzu arbeiten. Aber gehoert denn der Hund auch zu euch? Den habt ihr mithieher gebracht?" Missfaellig betrachtete er Leo, der sich an Gebharddraengte."Es ist Gebhards Liebling, sie sind so anhaenglich aneinander!" Herr Kurzbeachtete jetzt erst seinen kleinen Neffen."Das ist also Gebhard? Wir waren eigentlich der Meinung, er kaeme zuseiner Grossmutter; aber kommt nur herauf, es sind zwei Gastzimmergerichtet. Was ist mit deinem Mann, ist er einberufen?""Nein; er wird bald nachkommen.""Warum hat er dich nicht auf der langen Reise begleitet? Muss er noch imForsthaus bleiben?"Helene zoegerte mit der Antwort. "Ich erzaehle dir das morgen. Wir sind somuede, wenn wir uns vielleicht gleich legen duerften!""Ihr muesst doch vorher essen!""Danke, wir bekamen unterwegs was wir brauchten, nur Ruhe moechten wir."Der Hausherr hatte dem Stubenmaedchen geklingelt, das erschien nun um anStelle der Hausfrau, die nicht gestoert werden sollte, fuer die Gaeste zusorgen.Ein schoenes Gastzimmer mit allen Bequemlichkeiten war fuer Helenegerichtet, auch ein Kinderwagen stand bereit. Geruehrt dankte sie demBruder fuer diese Fuersorge. Die Kleine, die schlafend angekommen war,erwachte jetzt und fing kraeftig an zu schreien. Der Hausherr, der selbstkeine Kinder hatte, sah ratlos auf das kleine, ungebaerdige Wesen, befahldem Maedchen alles weitere zu besorgen und wuenschte der Schwester guteNacht. Gebhard nahm er mit sich, Leo folgte. "Wenn nur der Hund dieNachtruhe nicht stoert!" sagte der Onkel, waehrend sie die Treppe hinaufgingen."Vor meiner Tuer wird er gewiss ruhig liegen bleiben," versicherteGebhard."Das wird sich zeigen. Wenn Hunde in fremde Umgebung kommen, heulen sieoft. Mich wundert, dass dir dein Vater erlaubt hat ihn mitzunehmen!""Der Vater war gar nicht da, als wir abgereist sind." Gebhard hatte daskaum gesagt, so merkte er, dass er besser darueber geschwiegen haette."Wo ist denn dein Vater?" Was sollte Gebhard darauf antworten? Er wusstees nicht."Ich meine wo dein Vater war, als ihr fluechten musstet? Blieb er imForsthaus zurueck?""Nein." Die sichtliche Verlegenheit des Knaben fiel dem Manne auf. Esmusste etwas geschehen sein, was Mutter und Sohn nicht gern sagten.Er wollte nicht weiter in das Kind dringen. Im oberen Stock des Hauseswar ein zweites Gastzimmer bereitet, fein und vornehm war auch hier dieEinrichtung. "Kommst du allein zurecht?" fragte der Onkel, "oder sollich dir das Stubenmaedchen heraufschicken?""Nein danke, ich kann alles allein machen. Aber bitte, Onkel, wenn ichLeo eine Strohmatte oder eine Decke vor meine Tuer legen duerfte; erversteht dann, dass er da hingehoert."Es fand sich eine Matte und der Hund nahm verstaendig seinen Platz ein.Onkel und Neffe wuenschten sich gute Nacht. Gebhard lag bald in demfeinen Gastbett. Aber unter dem fremden Dach in dem einsamenSchlafgemach ueberfiel ihn ein bitteres Heimweh und trotz aller Muedigkeitkonnte er nicht einschlafen. So weit, weit weg war er vom Forsthaus! Undder Vater, wo war der? Der Vater, von dem man jetzt gar nicht redenkonnte, waehrend man frueher so stolz auf ihn war! Dem kleinen Burschenwar zumute, wie wenn ihm der Boden unter den Fuessen wankte, da mit derHeimat zugleich die klaren Verhaeltnisse der gluecklichen Kinderzeitschwanden, in denen er festgewurzelt war.Wenn wenigstens die Mutter nebenan schliefe oder etwas von der Kleinenzu hoeren waere, aber gar so einsam war es hier oben! Lange wehrte sichGebhard als tapferer, kleiner Mann gegen die Traenen; endlich kamen siedoch, das Schluchzen liess sich nicht mehr unterdruecken und schuettelteseinen Koerper.Mitten in der naechtlichen Stille wurde ein Laut hoerbar. Gebhard setztesich auf, lauschte und vernahm ein leises Winseln vor der Tuere. Sicherhatte das wachsame Tier seines kleinen Herrn Schluchzen vernommen undwar beunruhigt. Oder hatte es selbst Heimweh? Noch einmal derselbeungewohnte Laut. Es klang so traurig! Da musste Gebhard troesten. Ertastete sich in der Finsternis an die Tuere und hatte kaum einen Spaltgeoeffnet, so zwaengte sich der Hund herein und draengte sich mit freudigemBellen an seinen Herrn."Still, still!" mahnte Gebhard und das gut gezogene Tier verstummtesofort, aber es wedelte und bezeugte seine groesste Freude. "Ja, ja, dudarfst hier bleiben," fluesterte Gebhard, "du hast Heimweh; komm her!" Erholte leise die Matte herein und legte sie neben sein Bett. "So, dannsind wir beisammen, ganz nahe. Leg dich!"Vom Bett aus konnte Gebhard seinen Leo streicheln. Nun wich das Gefuehlder Einsamkeit, vorbei war's mit den naechtlichen Traenen. Schon nachwenigen Minuten hatten die beiden guten Kameraden den Schlaf gefunden.In der Fruehe des naechsten Morgen, noch ehe es heller Tag war, schreckteHelene auf durch ein Klingeln an der Haustuere. Wer kam so fruehe? Sicherihr Mann oder doch eine Nachricht von ihm! Im Nu warf sie einenMorgenrock um, eilte hinaus an die Treppentuere, denn sie selbst wollteihm oeffnen, ihn hereinfuehren in ihr Zimmer, ihn lieb haben.Ach--beschaemt stand sie vor dem Milchmann und vor dem Kuechenmaedchen, diebeide mit erstaunten Augen auf die junge Frau schauten; ohne ein Wortkehrte sie in ihr Schlafzimmer zurueck.Das war die erste Enttaeuschung und es folgten jede Stunde neue, denn dersehnlich Erwartete kam nicht, und keine Post brachte Nachricht von ihm.Bruder und Schwaegerin liessen sich's einen ganzen Tag gefallen, imUnklaren zu bleiben ueber das Schicksal, das die Familie Stegemanngetrennt hatte; sahen sie doch, wie verstoert Mutter und Sohn waren unddass sie sich nicht entschliessen konnten, von dem Erlebten zu sprechen.Die Schwaegerin war eine gutmuetige Frau, hatte Helene lieb und wollte,dass die Vertriebenen sich wohl fuehlten in ihrem Haus. Es war ja auchalles in Huelle und Fuelle da und keine Kriegsnot zu verspueren; denn inder Kurz'schen Fabrik, die in Friedenszeit allerlei feine Stahlwarenherstellte, wurden nun Granaten gemacht; der Betrieb war Tag und Nachtim Gang und es ging mehr Geld ein als je in frueheren Zeiten. Vielebeneideten die Familie Kurz und wollten ihr den wachsenden Reichtummissgoennen. So kam es dem Fabrikherrn und seiner Frau ganz erwuenscht, dassdie Vertriebenen bei ihnen Zuflucht suchten. Jedermann konnte nun sehen,dass von diesem Reichtum guter Gebrauch gemacht wurde. Aber unbequemwaren die Fragen der Bekannten nach den Schicksalen der jungen Familie,nach dem Verbleib des Foersters Stegemann. Was sollte man antworten, wennman selbst nichts wusste?Herr Kurz sprach mit seiner Frau. "So kann das nicht weiter gehen;Helene weicht allen Fragen aus und sieht gleich so ungluecklich aus, dassich nicht in sie dringen mag; und der Bub hat etwas trotzigZurueckhaltendes, das einem die Lust nimmt, ihn zu fragen. Helene schriebimmer so beglueckt ueber ihn, ruehmte sein offenes, zutunliches Wesen. Ichfinde nichts davon und wollte, er waere samt dem Hund anderswountergebracht. Aber nun, da er bei uns wie ein Kind vom Haus aufgenommenist, kann man wenigstens von ihm Antwort auf berechtigte Fragenerwarten. Nimm du ihn einmal vor. Er soll sagen, wo sein Vater ist. Ichwill das wissen.""Du hast ganz recht, habe nur Geduld, ich will es schon herausbringen,"sagte Frau Kurz beschwichtigend. An diesem Tag, waehrend ihr Mann in derFabrik war, und Helene auf Zureden der Schwaegerin sich auf ihr Ruhebettgelegt hatte, ergab sich's, dass Tante und Neffe allein beisammen warenund sie benuetzte die Gelegenheit, brachte die Sprache auf das Forsthaus,fragte, ob dieses nun ganz leer stehe, ob wohl Gebhards Buecher undSpiele alle mitgekommen seien oder sie ihm neue kaufen solle. Da wurdeGebhard vertraulich und mitteilsam; schilderte, wie hastig Hab und Gutaufgepackt worden seien und dass das meiste zurueckgeblieben sei."Was dir oder der Mutter fehlt, werde ich euch alles neu kaufen," sagtedie Tante guetig, und der kleine, wohlerzogene Mann kuesste ihr dankbar dieHand. Nun fragte die Tante weiter: "Hat dein Vater seine eigenen Sachenselbst aufgepackt, und hat er euch begleitet bei der Abfahrt?""Nein," sagte Gebhard und wandte sich schon von der Tante ab, der Tuerezu. Sie merkte, er wollte weiteren Fragen ausweichen. Aber so hatte siees nicht gemeint. Sie griff nach seiner Hand. "Nun bleibe noch da,Gebhard, und erzaehle mir ganz genau, wann dein Vater fortgegangen ist,warum und wohin. Das muessen wir wissen, dein Onkel und ich."Da Gebhard schwieg, fuhr sie fort: "Die Mutter ist doch so traurig, dassiehst du ja und wenn sie ueber den Vater spricht, regt es sie auf, darumwill ich sie nicht fragen. Willst du ihr das abnehmen und ihr zulieb miralles sagen?""Nein, ich kann nicht!" rief Gebhard gequaelt und wollte entweichen. Aberdie Tante hielt ihn fest."Weisst du, dass du recht unartig bist? Nun haben wir die Mutter mit derKleinen und dich und sogar deinen Hund mitten in der Nacht bei unsaufgenommen und sorgen fuer euch, weil ihr gar keine Heimat habt und duwillst mir nicht einmal anvertrauen, wo der Vater ist? So undankbarwillst du sein?""Nein, ich will nicht undankbar sein, aber ich kann's nicht sagen," riefder Knabe entschieden und suchte sich loszumachen. Frau Kurz verlor dieGeduld, packte ihn fest und rief: "Gebhard, du musst!"Da riss er sich mit Gewalt los, rief in heller Verzweiflung: "Ich willdie Mutter fragen, ob ich muss," und stuerzte aus dem Zimmer, hinueber indas der Mutter. Die schrak aus ihrer Mittagsruhe auf, als Gebhardungestuem auf sie zukam und laut schluchzend rief: "Mutter, muss ich denVater verraten? Muss ich?" Erschreckt zog Helene das ganz erschuetterteKind an sich und wollte ihm troestend zusprechen, aber durch dieoffengebliebene Tuere war die Tante dem Fluechtling gefolgt und hatteGebhards Ausruf gehoert. "Du hast ihn ja schon verraten," sagte sie, "gehjetzt hinaus, ich weiss genug. Geh in dein Zimmer, du machst ja deinMuetterchen noch krank mit deinem Ungestuem!"Beschaemt und traurig zog Gebhard sich zurueck. In seinem Zimmer sass erstill, wusste nicht, wie es gekommen war, dass die Tante sagen konnte, erhabe den Vater verraten und er mache die Mutter krank, mochte sichselbst nicht mehr leiden und wusste sich keinen Rat.Inzwischen hatte Frau Kurz sich neben die junge Schwaegerin gesetzt,troestete sie freundlich und brachte allmaehlich durch teilnehmendeFragen und dringendes Zureden alles heraus, was sie wissen und ihremMann berichten wollte.Dieser empfand wohl volle Teilnahme fuer seine Schwester, aber er dachteauch an sich selbst, an die Familienehre und an das Geschaeft. Es wareine boese Sache. Er fuerchtete, die militaerischen Auftraege koennten ihmentzogen werden, wenn des Schwagers Verrat ruchbar wuerde. Aufgeregt ginger in seinem Zimmer auf und ab, waehrend er seiner Frau diese Gefahrauseinander setzte. "Nie haette ich gedacht, dass durch Stegemann Unehrein die Familie kaeme. Wie sah Helene an ihm hinauf, wie stolz sprach sievon seinen und seiner Mutter edlen Grundsaetzen! Wie wenn die FamilieStegemann viel hoeher stuende als unsere eigene! Nun, wenn wir auchnuechterne Leute sind und unsern Geschaeftsvorteil wahren, einenVaterlandsverraeter haben wir doch nie in unserer Familie gehabt!""Sprich nur nicht laut davon," mahnte seine Frau, "das bleibt ganzverschwiegen. Ich glaube nicht, dass ihn die Russen frei gegeben habenund wenn ja, dann kann er nicht wagen, sich in Deutschland blicken zulassen, nach dem was er getan. Mach dir keine Sorgen. Wer sollte dasverraten? Helene nicht und der Bub auch nicht, auf den kannst du dichverlassen!"So beruhigte sie ihren Mann. Und es kam so, wie sie gesagt, niemanderfuhr mehr von dem Vermissten als was sie selbst von ihm aussagten: ersei im Krieg und man warte vergeblich auf Nachrichten.Viertes Kapitel.Die Tage, die Wochen vergingen--vom Foerster Stegemann drang keine Kundezu seiner Frau. Sie lebte still und eingezogen. Vom Krieg wollte sienichts hoeren, nichts lesen und wenn jemand sie darauf hinwies, dass garviele Frauen ihre Maenner, ihre Soehne vermissen mussten, so war ihr daskein Trost. Andere Frauen durften stolz sein auf das, was ihre Maennertaten fuers Vaterland--sie musste sich schaemen; die andern warenunschuldig--sie hatte eine Schuld auf dem Gewissen. Wenn Gebhard sietraurig ansah, musste sie an sein Wort denken: Haettest du die Tuere nichtaufgemacht!Gebhard ging in die Schule, aber er stand einsam unter den Mitschuelern,fremd dem Lehrer gegenueber. Der sprach von Krieg und Sieg, vonVaterlandsliebe und Heldentod--das konnte Gebhard nur mit bitterer Schamanhoeren; und wenn die Kameraden von ihren Angehoerigen im Feld erzaehlten,dann hatte er Angst vor ihren Fragen, ging ihnen aus dem Weg, spieltelieber daheim mit Leo, seinem treuen, schweigsamen Freund aus der altenHeimat.Eines Abends, als er still und spaeter als sonst an seinen Schulaufgabenin dem Zimmer neben dem Esszimmer sass und ihn wohl niemand dortvermutete, hoerte er Onkel und Tante sprechen, was nicht fuer ihn bestimmtwar. Der Onkel sagte: "Das Beste waere, Stegemann bliebe verschollen, erwuerde doch nur Schande bringen in unsere Familie.""Ja," sagte die Tante, "aber ich denke, er ist laengst tot, wenn man esnur bestimmt erfahren koennte."Da tat dem kleinen Burschen nebenan das Herz so weh, wie noch nie und erfuehlte, wie lieb er seinen Vater hatte, trotz allem was geschehen war,und dass er ganz zu ihm gehoerte. Und ein Zorn kochte in ihm auf gegen dieMenschen, die den Vater gern gestorben wuessten. Aber er durfte ja nichtssagen, denn gar oft schon hatte die Mutter ihm vorgehalten, wie dankbarsie gegen Onkel und Tante sein muessten.In diesem Augenblick kam die Mutter zu ihm herein, hatte ihr Toechterchenim weissen Nachtgewand im Arm und zeigte sie Gebhard: "Sieh, wie dieKleine nett aussieht, sie soll noch der Tante gute Nacht sagen, kommmit."Ungern folgte Gebhard. Im Esszimmer wurde der kleine Liebling bewundert.Der Onkel, der fuer gewoehnlich um diese Zeit nicht da war und das Kindselten sah, freute sich an dem netten Anblick, wollte auch der Muttereine Freude machen und sagte schmeichelnd zu der Kleinen: "Willst dudenn auch einmal zu mir kommen, mein schoenes Juengferlein?""Nein, sie soll nicht!" rief ploetzlich mit rotem Kopf in aufbrausendemZorn Gebhard. Erschrocken wandten sich alle nach ihm um, aber er achtetenicht auf die vorwurfsvollen Blicke. "Es ist nicht dein Juengferlein,"rief er, "es ist dem Vater sein Juengferlein, und mir gehoert sie auchmit. Gib sie mir, Mutter, mir, nicht dem Onkel!" Er draengte sich an dieMutter, die ganz blass geworden war. "Was faellt dir ein, Gebhard!" undsie wandte sich an den tief gekraenkten Bruder: "Verzeih, ich weiss garnicht, was dem Kind in den Sinn kommt!"Die Schwaegerin sah, wie ihrem Mann der Zorn aufstieg. Sie wandte sich anHelene: "Wenn du irgend etwas von Erziehung verstehst, so musst du dasToechterchen dem Onkel geben und musst den unartigen Jungen zur Tuerehinausstecken!""Ja freilich, du hast ganz recht," sagte Helene. Sie sah ein, dass sieeinen solchen Ton nicht dulden durfte, aber sie fuehlte durch, und sah esGebhard an, dass er tief erregt war, und er tat ihr so leid. Sie konnteihn nicht verstehen. Es war doch gar nichts vorgefallen, was ihn soaufbringen und seine Rede entschuldigen konnte. So zog sie das Kindchenzurueck, nach dem er noch immer begehrte, reichte es dem Onkel hin, undsagte unsicher: "Ich muss dich aus dem Zimmer weisen, Gebhard!" Er sahsie einen Augenblick erstaunt an, weil er so etwas noch nie von ihrerfahren hatte, dann folgte er ohne Widerspruch. Unter der Tuere blickteer noch einmal zurueck und sah die Mutter mit Onkel und Tante beisammenstehen, das Schwesterchen auf des Onkels Arm. Da war's ihm, als gehoertendiese vier zusammen, er aber gehoerte nicht zu ihnen, sondern zu demarmen, armen Vater, der so weit fort war und den er doch ueber alles inder Welt liebte.So wuchs allmaehlich eine Scheidewand zwischen ihm und der Mutter auf. Esfehlte der Vater, der die beiden so innig verbunden hatte.Aber es kam Hilfe von anderer Seite. Frau Dr. Stegemann, GebhardsGrossmutter, kannte Helene nur wenig, aber sie hatte sie vor Jahr und Tagherzlich als Schwiegertochter willkommen geheissen, manchen Brief mit ihrgewechselt und sich innig gefreut ueber das Glueck, das sie ihrem Sohn undEnkel von Herzen goennte. Sie konnte sich vorstellen, wie schwer diejunge Frau unter der Trennung von dem Gatten leiden musste. Aber siebegriff nicht, warum die Schwiegertochter ihr jetzt nur selten und kurzschrieb, ihr, der Mutter, die doch am besten mit ihr fuehlen konnte unddie laengst gebeten hatte, ihr die genaueren Umstaende ueber dieVerschleppung ihres Sohnes zu berichten. Die Schwiegertochterentschuldigte sich damit, dass es sie zu sehr angreife, von diesemschrecklichsten Tag ihres Lebens zu erzaehlen; aber Frau Dr. Stegemanngab sich nicht laenger mit diesem Bescheid zufrieden. Als es Winter wurdeund immer dieselben duerftigen, traurigen Briefe kamen, schrieb sie derSchwiegertochter, wofern sie und die Kinder gesund seien, moege sie mitihnen in Gebhards Weihnachtsferien zu ihr kommen. Es klang mehr wie einVerlangen als wie eine Bitte oder Einladung.Helene zeigte den Brief ihren Geschwistern."Du haettest deiner Schwiegermutter laengst den ganzen Sachverhaltmitteilen sollen," meinte der Bruder, "sie als Mutter kann erwarten, dassihr nichts vom Schicksal ihres Sohnes verschwiegen wird.""Aber es kann ihr doch nur schrecklich sein! Sie hat uns bei Beginn desKrieges voll gluehender Vaterlandsliebe geschrieben. Und dann--ich trauemich nicht, ihr zu sagen, wie das alles gekommen ist, sie wird michverachten, denn sie ist so eine tapfere, strenge Frau!"Die Schwaegerin fiel ihr ins Wort: "Immer quaelst du dich wieder sounnoetig mit Vorwuerfen. Jede Frau haette so wie du fuer ihr und ihrerKinder Leben gebeten!""_Sie_ nicht!" sagte Helene bestimmt. Der Bruder wurde aergerlich. Er warimmer ein wenig eifersuechtig gewesen und hatte nie recht vertragenkoennen, dass seine geliebte Schwester eine so hohe Meinung von derFamilie Stegemann hatte."Du bist nicht schuld," sagte er; "ein Mann muss selbst wissen, was er zutun hat; es waere ohne deine Einrede wohl alles ebenso gegangen!"Aber jetzt ereiferte sich Helene. "Nein, nie, ganz gewiss nicht. Ichbegreife mich selbst nicht mehr, warum ich nicht lieber mit meinem Kindsterben wollte: der Tod ist nicht das schlimmste!"Sie brach in Traenen aus. Der Bruder suchte sie zu beruhigen. "Dubrauchst deiner Schwiegermutter nicht zu erzaehlen, was _du_ bei derSache gesprochen hast. Darueber schweigst du einfach!""Ach, das kann ich nicht, wenn sie mich mit ihren klaren Augen ansieht,so muss ich die ganze Wahrheit sagen. Sie wuerde es doch gleich merken,dass mir noch etwas auf der Seele liegt.""Ei, so bleibe hier!" riet die Schwaegerin. "Schicke ihr Gebhard allein,sage, du koennest mit der Kleinen im Winter nicht reisen und ohne dasKind nicht fort. Zwar waere sie ja bei mir und dem Maedchen wohl versorgt,aber es ist doch eine gute Ausrede; versprich deinen Besuch fuersFruehjahr, dann wollen wir weiter sehen.""Ja, das wird das Beste sein," sagte der Bruder, "sie kann dieWinterreise und dazu solch eine Aufregung nicht von dir verlangen undGebhard wird sehr gern zu seiner Grossmutter gehen mit seinem Hund,na--er kann auch ganz dort bleiben, wenn sie es wuenscht.""Er wird sich nicht gern von mir trennen wollen!""Das bildest du dir ein, so ist er nicht.""Meinst du?" Nachdenklich fuegte sie hinzu: "Ja, es kann sein, dass ermich nicht vermisst. Es ist alles nicht mehr so, wie es war. Aber dannwerden wir uns ganz fremd!""Du musst dich an dein Toechterchen halten, das wird alle Tage netter undgehoert dir ganz und gar."Aber die junge Mutter konnte sich nicht gleich mit dem Gedanken troesten,dass ihr der kleine Liebling blieb. Es tat ihr weh, zu denken, Gebhardwerde sie nicht vermissen. Sie war doch so stolz gewesen auf des KnabenLiebe und seine ruehrende Verehrung."Ich will selbst Gebhard die Einladung der Grossmutter ausrichten," sagteder Bruder, die Beratung abschliessend. "Ruhe du dich ein wenig aus unddann schreibe deiner Schwiegermutter. Gebhard ist ja bei ihr gutversorgt und fuer dich wird es so am besten sein, meinst du nicht?""Ich weiss nicht," sagte Helene, "aber ich will es so machen, wie ihrmeint, ich danke euch, ihr seid so nachsichtig gegen mich."Sie ging in ihr Zimmer und tat, wie man ihr geraten, legte sich auf ihrRuhebett. Ach, sie meinten es so gut mit ihr, aber sie hatten ja garkeine Ahnung, wie traurig sie war, wie heiss ihre Sehnsucht nach demverlorenen Glueck.Herr Kurz hatte es gut verstanden, Gebhard die Reise zur Grossmutterverlockend darzustellen. Davon, dass er vermutlich dauernd bei ihrbleiben sollte, hatte er nichts erwaehnt, das hatte noch Zeit. So behieltder Onkel recht. Gebhard war nur vergnuegt ueber die Einladung fuer dieWeihnachtsferien, dachte gar nicht an die Trennung von der Mutter. Eswar ja natuerlich, dass das Kind sich freute zur Grossmutter zu kommen, diein den Jahren der Einsamkeit im Forsthaus treulich jeden Sommer gekommenwar und ihm laengst nahe stand, ehe Helene zur Familie gehoerte.Heute ging die Mutter mit ihm hinauf in sein Zimmer, um mit ihmeinzupacken. Frohgemut reichte er ihr zu, was sie verlangte, aufmerksamverfolgte Leo dieses ungewohnte Treiben. "Jetzt deine Schulbuecher,Gebhard?""Soll ich die mitnehmen?" Verwundert sah er die Mutter an und bedenklichklang seine Frage: "Muss ich denn lernen in den Weihnachtsferien?""In den Ferien nicht, aber nachher, wenn die Schule wieder anfaengt, musstdu doch deine Buecher haben.""Nach den Ferien komme ich doch wieder hieher?""So war's nicht gemeint, Gebhard. Die Grossmutter wird dich gernebehalten. Hat dir davon der Onkel nichts gesagt?""Nein." Er wurde sehr nachdenklich. Die Mutter stand vor dem Koffer,hatte die Hand ausgestreckt nach den Schulbuechern, die nicht kamen. Siesah, wie Gebhards Gesicht truebselig wurde. Jetzt schmiegte er sich ansie. "Mutter, kannst du nicht mitkommen zu der Grossmutter? Hat sie blossmich ganz allein eingeladen?""Nein, aber das Schwesterchen ist noch zu klein fuer solch eineWinterreise und sie braucht mich doch!""Ja, aber Mutter, du hast viel frueher einmal zu mir gesagt, wir bliebenjetzt immer beisammen, der Vater und du und ich; das war so schoen. Undjetzt ist der Vater fort und dann habe ich auch keine Mutter mehr!""O doch, Gebhard, ich bleibe ganz gewiss deine treue Mutter!" AberGebhard entgegnete trotzig: "So eine Mutter, die nicht bei mir ist,hilft mir gar nichts. So eine habe ich immer schon gehabt, im Himmel,aber ich moechte eine, die bei mir bleibt.""Spaeter, Gebhard, kommen wir gewiss wieder zusammen, aber jetzt hast dueinstweilen die Grossmutter. Bei ihr warst du doch frueher so gern; undhier--warst du denn gerne hier im Haus, bei Onkel und Tante?""Nein, gar nicht gern, weil sie den Vater nicht moegen. Neulich haben sieso etwas Schreckliches ueber den Vater gesagt, das darfst du gar nichthoeren, Mutter. Darum mag ich sie gar nicht mehr!" Traenen des Zornskamen dem Kind bei der Erinnerung."Wann war denn das?""An dem Abend, wo der Onkel das Juengferlein wollte!""Ach, damals? Gebhard, sieh, du wirst gluecklicher sein bei derGrossmutter. Sie hat den Vater so lieb und sie nimmt dich mit deinem Leoso gerne zu sich!""So? hat sie das geschrieben?" Langsam machte er sich von der Mutterlos. "Da sind meine Schulbuecher."Still vollendeten sie das Geschaeft des Einpackens; aber beunruhigt liefder Hund hin und her, er merkte, dass Ungewohntes vor sich ging."Du darfst mit mir gehen, Leo, sei nur zufrieden, wir zwei trennen unsnicht!" Bei diesen Worten nahm Gebhard den schmalen Kopf des Hundeszwischen seine Haende. Ein leises Bellen bezeugte das Einverstaendnis desklugen Tiers; es legte sich nun still neben den Koffer, bereit Hab undGut seines kleinen Herrn zu bewachen.Sie waren fertig, das Zimmer sah oede aus."Komm nun, Gebhard," sagte die Mutter und es war ihr wehmuetig ums Herzin dem leeren Zimmer, "komm, wir wollen nach dem Schwesterlein sehen."Er griff nach ihrer Hand, sah zu ihr auf und merkte, dass sie traurigwar. "Mutter," begann er, "jetzt denkst du an den Vater, das sehe ichdir immer an. Aber du hast noch dein Juengferlein, das ist dir doch dasallerliebste und das bleibt bei dir."Sie drueckte fest seine Hand. Nein, sie hatte jetzt eben nicht an ihrenMann gedacht, sondern an den kleinen Mann, der da so liebevoll an ihrerHand ging und sie noch troestete, obwohl sie ihn von sich schickte.Schon vor der Zimmertuere hoerten sie die Tante, die ihren Spass hatte mitder Kleinen. Die lachte laut und uebermuetig vor Vergnuegen. Das lustigeToechterlein--der traurige Bub--es gab der Mutter zu denken.Am fruehen Morgen des folgenden Tags trat Helene in GebhardsSchlafzimmer. Er erwachte bei ihrem Eintritt. Frisch und tatkraeftigstand die Mutter vor ihm, wie schon lange nicht mehr. "Gebhard, stehauf, es ist Zeit, dass wir reisen, wir zwei miteinander!" Und als er siemit grossen, fragenden Augen ansah, lachte sie hell, setzte sich zu ihmauf den Bettrand und sagte: "Ich habe mir heute Nacht gedacht: dasJuengferlein ist schnoede, es macht sich gar nichts daraus, wenn ichfortgehe, es jauchzt bei der Tante wie bei mir. Aber mein Bub, dermoechte mich gern bei sich haben; so will ich wenigstens fuer eine Wochemit ihm gehen!" Da wurde die junge Frau stuermisch umarmt und gekuesst undmusste an ihren Mann denken.Eine Stunde spaeter waren sie auf der Reise.Fuenftes Kapitel.Unsere zwei Reisenden waren diesmal allein im Abteil: Leo hatte sichnicht eingedraengt; ganz verstaendig hatte er sich darein gefunden, in demfuer seinesgleichen bestimmten Raum Platz zu nehmen. Gebhard stand eineganze Weile am Fenster und sah in die Winterlandschaft hinaus; ihm warso wunderlich gluecklich zu Mute, wie wenn ihm erst jetzt die Mutterwieder gehoerte. Er haette nur gern gewusst, wie es ihr ums Herz war! Schoneinmal hatte er sich nach ihr umgewandt, sie sinnend angeschaut, abernicht die Worte finden koennen zu einer Frage. Nun sah er sie wieder an."Willst du etwas?" fragte sie."Nein.--Ja doch. Ich moechte nur wissen, ob es dich nicht friert?""Nein; warum meinst du? Kommt es dir kalt vor?""Mir gar nicht. Der Onkel meinte nur, du koenntest dich erkaelten; abergelt, es ist behaglich warm? Heute gefaellt mir das Fahren so gut, dirauch, Mutter?"Sie laechelte ihn freundlich an und schob die Reisetasche beiseite, dieneben ihr lag. "Setze dich zu mir her, Gebhard."Dieser folgte schnell der Aufforderung und sie rueckten nahe zusammen."Gelt, das Juengferlein ist ganz vergnuegt bei der Tante?" sagte er."Ja freilich, das vermisst uns nicht.""Das gefaellt mir eben so besonders gut, dass ich dich einmal ganz fuermich allein habe," erklaerte er, "da koennen wir auch vom Vater sprechen,wenn wir wollen. Aber die Tante hat gesagt, ich soll dich nichtaufregen; also reden wir lieber von etwas anderem. Sie hat mir auchEssvorrat mitgegeben in meine Buechse; wollen wir das einmal ansehen?""Ja, sagte die Mutter, schauen wir nach den guten Sachen, das wird michganz gewiss nicht aufregen." Sie lachte ihn freundlich an."Du siehst heute so aus, Mutter, wie frueher, so nett." Aber das haette ernicht sagen sollen; denn auf einmal kamen ein paar Traenen in ihre hellenAugen. Da packte er schnell die Buechse aus; und weil ihm dabei ein Apfelauf den Boden kollerte und waehrend er sich darnach bueckte eine ganzeAnzahl Nuesse folgten, musste sie lachen und er lachte mit und sie warenzum erstenmal froehlich miteinander ohne den Vater.Gegen das Ende der Reise, waehrend Gebhard sich schon ungeduldig auf dasWiedersehen mit der Grossmutter freute, wurde der jungen Frau das Herzwieder schwer. Sie hatte sich wohl auf ihres Bruders Zuredenvorgenommen, nichts davon zu erzaehlen, dass sie ihren Mann ueberredethatte, mit den Russen zu gehen, und so durfte sie ja sicher sein, beiihrer Schwiegermutter nur Teilnahme zu finden und keinen Vorwurf zuhoeren. Aber eben dieses Verschweigen und vorsichtige Ausweichen lagnicht in ihrer Natur und deshalb bangte ihr vor dem Zusammentreffen mitder Mutter.Helene wusste, dass sie nicht erwartet wurde; nur Gebhard mit seinemtreuen Gefaehrten Leo war angekuendigt. Als die Reisenden in dieBahnhofhalle einfuhren, fiel ihnen die Leere des Bahnsteigs auf. Er warfuer die Menge gesperrt, da in Kuerze ein Lazarettzug mit einer grossenAnzahl Verwundeter ankommen sollte. Eine ganze Reihe Sanitaeter mitTragbahren erwartete den naechsten Zug; aber mitten unter ihnen standeine einzelne grosse Frau in langem Mantel mit warmem Pelzzeug; unterihrem schwarzen Samthut sahen schlichte graue Haare hervor undforschende Augen blickten dem einfahrenden Zug entgegen. Dies war FrauDr. Stegemann, die sich bei dem Kommandanten den Zutritt erbeten hatte,um ihren allein reisenden Enkelsohn abzuholen.Gebhard erkannte die Grossmutter sofort und eilte auf sie zu."Mein lieber, grosser Bub!" rief sie, "ich bin froh, dass du zu mirgekommen bist. Und dein schoener Leo ist auch da! Nun komm nur gleich,wir muessen moeglichst schnell den Bahnsteig verlassen.""Aber die Mutter ist auch hier, ich bin nur vorausgesprungen!""Die Mutter? Kommt sie doch mit?"Ja, sie kam eben zu den beiden und sah deutlich, dass bei demunerwarteten Wiedersehen das ernste Gesicht der Grossmutter freudigaufleuchtete."So kommst du doch," sagte sie und streckte der jungen Frau die Handentgegen, "dann ist ja alles schoen und gut; wir gehoeren doch zusammen indieser Zeit!"Das empfand auch Helene in diesem Augenblick. Wie wenn sie ihrem Mannenaeher waere, so war ihr zumute. Sie hatte gar nicht mehr gewusst, dassMutter und Sohn ganz die gleichen, klaren, seelenvollen Augen unddieselbe tiefe Stimme hatten. Sie gingen miteinander hinaus auf denBahnhofplatz. Dort war die Haltestelle der Elektrischen; das Mitnehmenvon Hunden war aber nicht gestattet."Kann Leo nachspringen?" fragte die Grossmutter."Er kann wohl," sagte Gebhard, "aber der Vater laesst ihn nie gern nebendem Wagen springen.""Dann gehst du mit ihm zu Fuss; erinnerst du dich des Weges? Du hast ihnvor zwei Jahren gemacht.""Nicht so recht," meinte Gebhard bedenklich."Wir sollten vielleicht eine Droschke nehmen und den Hund zu unshereinlassen," schlug Helene vor."Bewahre. Ein grosser Bub mit solch gutem Hund _sucht_ sich eben seinenWeg. Merke auf, Gebhard. Du folgst den Schienen der Elektrischen immerzu bis an den Marktplatz. Dann fragst du. Weisst du Strasse und Nummer?""Jawohl, Johannessteg 5."Die beiden Frauen stiegen ein und Gebhard ging mit seinem treuenBegleiter zu Fuss. Helene wunderte sich ueber die Grossmutter, die demgeliebten Enkel gleich Zumutungen machte. Ja, das war wieder dieStrenge, die sie in Erinnerung hatte; nicht der gutmuetige, weichherzigeTon, den sie von den Ihrigen daheim gewohnt war. Nun wusste sie wieder,warum ihr bange gewesen, und es ueberkam sie eine beklemmende Angst vorder Unterredung, die nicht ausbleiben konnte.Frau Dr. Stegemann bewohnte den obersten Stock eines Hauses in derAltstadt. Die schoenen, bequemen Einrichtungen der Neuzeit fehlten dieserWohnung, hingegen war sie geraeumig, hatte viele Zimmer, Kammern undGaenge. Aus den altmodisch kleinen Fenstern blickte man hinweg ueber dieDaecher der gegenueberliegenden Haeuser, ueber Gassen und Strassen hinaus insWeite, wo Gaerten und Felder die Stadt begrenzten. Der letzteSonnenstrahl fand noch seinen Weg in die hochgelegene Wohnung.Ausser einem Dienstmaedchen hatte Frau Dr. Stegemann noch zwei jungeHausgenossinnen, zwei Enkeltoechter, die hier in der groesseren Stadt eineToechterschule besuchten. Von ihnen erzaehlte sie Helene, nachdem sie dieElektrische verlassen und dem Haus zugingen, denn beide mochten nichtauf der Strasse von dem sprechen, was ihre Herzen am meisten bewegte.Waehrend sie im Haus angekommen Stockwerk um Stockwerk hinaufstiegen,wunderte sich Helene ueber die Sechzigerin, die nichts von derAnstrengung zu merken schien."Mutter, wie du steigen kannst!""Das macht die Gewohnheit.""Aber ist dir's nicht laestig? Du duerftest dir's wohl auch leichtermachen.""Warum? Ich bleibe gern in der Uebung. Solange ich gesund bin, schadetmir das Steigen nichts. Es waere nichts als Bequemlichkeit, wenn ich esnicht mehr tun wollte."Ruestig stieg sie voraus.Oben angekommen wurden sie vom Dienstmaedchen empfangen mit derNachricht, dass ein fremdes Fraeulein schon lange auf sie warte und siesprechen moechte. Gleichzeitig kamen eilig und lebhaft die beidenSchwestern, Grete und Else, grosse Maedchen mit blonden Zoepfen undfrischen, froehlichen Gesichtern. Sie waren ueberrascht, statt deserwarteten kleinen Vetters ihre Tante Helene zu sehen, die sie nur nachdem Bild kannten. "Macht es der Tante behaglich, Kinder," sagte dieGrossmutter zu ihnen, "und du, Helene, lass dich nicht abschrecken, wennes bei mir unruhig zugeht; das ist eben so in diesem Kriegsjahr. Es gibtso viele Maedchen, die im Ausland waren und jetzt stellenlos sind, diewenden sich an uns 'Freundinnen der jungen Maedchen'. Um so etwas wird essich auch jetzt handeln."Sie verliess das Zimmer. Helene war verwundert. Sie hatte sich das Lebender Grossmutter still und abgeschlossen gedacht, merkte jetzt, dass diesenoch mitten im Leben und Wirken stand und sah bald, dass auch die beidenEnkelinnen an allerlei Kriegshilfe teilnahmen und vom Geist derGrossmutter beseelt waren.Sie wandten sich jetzt lebhaft an die junge Tante, deren lieblicheErscheinung ihnen gar sehr gefiel, halfen ihr ablegen, plaudertenzutraulich und kamen bald auf das zu sprechen, was sie erfuellte. "Duerfenwir dir unsere Vorratskammer zeigen? Wir haben einen ganzen StossKinderwaesche genaeht fuer die vertriebenen Ostpreussen und haben Handschuheund Socken fuer die Soldaten gestrickt, magst du es ansehen?" Gernefolgte Helene den eifrigen Maedchen in ihre Stube und liess sich an dasaltmodische Pfeilerschraenkchen fuehren, in dem allerlei Arbeitenaufgestapelt waren. Mitten in dieser Betrachtung kam, von seinem Hundbegleitet, Gebhard an. Er hatte sich nicht gern von seiner Muttergetrennt; denn er wusste, sie war nur ihm zuliebe hieher gekommen, auchhatte er so ein unbestimmtes Gefuehl, dass ihr bangte vor dem Zusammenseinmit der Grossmutter. So war er im Galopp mit seinem Hund der Elektrischengefolgt, hatte schnell den Weg zum Haus gesucht und trat nun angeregtvom raschen Lauf, mit frischen, roten Backen ins Zimmer.Grete und Else waren gleich fuer diesen kleinen Vetter eingenommen undauch der Hund war ihnen anziehend. Sie hatten noch nie einen solchen alsHausgenossen gehabt, wollten mit ihm Bekanntschaft schliessen, wichen ihmaber doch aus, als er sie beschnueffelte.Es dauerte aber nicht lang, so streckte sich Leo behaglich mitten unterder Gesellschaft aus."Jetzt ist er schon heimisch," sagte Gebhard befriedigt, "er merkt, dasswir nicht bei Fremden sind; in einem fremden Haus legt er sich nie vonselbst nieder." Das gefiel den Baeschen und freute Gebhard. Wo er gernwar und wo es Leo behagte, musste sich doch auch sein Muetterlein heimischfuehlen.Nach kurzer Zeit kam auch die Grossmutter wieder. Sie hatte dem jungenMaedchen Bescheid gegeben, das in England Erzieherin gewesen war, inreichem Haus, bei einem einzigen Knaben; jetzt war ihr eine Stelleangeboten, in einfacher Familie bei vier Knaben. Den juengsten solltesie selbst ausfahren, das passte ihr nicht."Ich habe ihr Mut gemacht," sagte Frau Dr. Stegemann, "im Krieg muss manfroh sein, wenn man irgendwo unterschlupfen darf, und uebrigens moechteich jetzt lieber zehn Deutsche erziehen als einen Englaender. Und warumnicht den kleinen Buben ausfahren? Wir muessen ja froh sein, wenn esrecht viele deutsche Buben gibt! Sie will es nun versuchen und mir amSonntag berichten wie es geht. Aber nun kommt zum Tee!"Sie fuehrte die Schwiegertochter ueber den langen, dunkeln Gang. Helenedachte unwillkuerlich an die hell erleuchteten Raeume in ihres BrudersHaus."Ueberall merkt man den Krieg," sagte Frau Stegemann. "Das Petroleum wirdbei euch auch knapp sein.""Ich weiss nicht, es war nicht die Rede davon.""Nicht? Es ist eine grosse Entbehrung fuer viele Leute. Manche Familienkoennen abends ihr Zimmer gar nicht beleuchten. Fuer solche ersparen wirimmer etwas von dem Petroleum, das auf uns kommt. Warum sollten wir auchnicht ein wenig im Dunkeln tappen? Unsere Soldaten muessen sich auf ganzanders schwierigen Wegen im Finstern zurecht finden."Gebhard horchte hoch auf bei diesen und aehnlichen Aeusserungen derGrossmutter. Waehrend des einfachen Abendessens erklaerten ihm dieSchwestern, was kriegsmaessig sei und was nicht; was sich die Familiezugunsten des Vaterlandes versagte und wie sie beflissen war, sich vondem zu naehren, was reichlich vorhanden und in Gefahr war, zu verderben.Da nun Else und Grete sahen, wie neu ihm das alles war und dass ergluehenden Eifer zeigte fuer alles Gemeinnuetzige, fragten sie, ob ermittun wuerde, wenn sie naechsten Sonntag mit der Rotkreuzbuechse durch dieStrassen gingen, um Karten und Blumen zugunsten der Verwundetenanzubieten. Er hatte das schon manchmal gesehen, aber nie daran gedacht,dass man auch ihn irgendwie fuer solch vaterlaendische Taetigkeit brauchenkoennte. Stolz war er, gluecklich ueber diese neuen Aussichten."Grossmutter," rief Else, "das wird fein! Gebhard traegt die Buechse, wirdie Blumen und wir sagen zu allen, die uns begegnen: 'Hier, unserVetter, ist selbst ein Vertriebener, ein Fluechtling aus Ostpreussen!' Dagibt uns jedermann doppelt so gern!""Und den Hund nehmen wir auch mit," schlug Grete vor, "er sieht sopolizeimaessig aus, mit ihm koennen wir uns in alle Winkel der Stadtwagen!"Die drei verwandten Kinder verbanden sich nach kurzer Bekanntschaft undwaren gluecklich miteinander. Helene staunte, wie schnell Gebhard sichheimisch fuehlte. Am reichbesetzten Tisch ihrer Geschwister hatte sie ihnnie so befriedigt gesehen, wie hier; das Wohlleben hatte ihm wenigerbehagt, als die einfachen Verhaeltnisse, die er von Hause aus gewoehntwar, und wie heimische Luft empfand er die vaterlaendische Gesinnung, dieauch im Forsthaus der herrschende Geist gewesen war.Sechstes Kapitel.Die Teestunde war vorueber, endlich musste auch der Augenblick kommen, aufden Helene sich gefuerchtet hatte, die Aussprache ueber das, was imstillen Herzen beide Frauen mehr beschaeftigte als all die Dinge, ueberdie sie sich mit den Kindern unterhalten hatten."Ich moechte jetzt ungestoert ein Stuendchen mit Tante Helene sein," sagteFrau Dr. Stegemann zu den Schwestern. "Wer etwa kommt und nach mirfragt, soll warten oder spaeter wiederkommen. Gebhard kann bei euchbleiben; komm, Helene, wir gehen in dein Zimmer."Aber Helene griff unwillkuerlich nach Gebhards Hand und hielt sie fest.Die Grossmutter sah die fast aengstliche Bewegung der jungen Frau."Du moechtest Gebhard mitnehmen?" fragte sie erstaunt."O ja, bitte. Wir haben das alles miteinander erlebt.""So komm mit, Gebhard. Ich zeige dir gleich deine Schlafstaette." Vor derTuere wartete der Hund, er schloss sich seinem kleinen Herrn an. Frau Dr.Stegemann ging voran, fuehrte ihre Gaeste bis an das Ende eines langenGanges. "Hier ist das Gastzimmer, das wird fuer dich gerichtet, Helene;wir wussten ja nicht, dass du kommst. Und hier gegenueber, ist deineKammer, Gebhard, sieh."Sie traten in eine grosse, helle Kammer. Ein schlichtes Feldbett standdarin. "Wie fuer einen richtigen Soldaten," sagte die Grossmutter, "nurdass es ein Kopfkissen und ein Federbett hat. Das bekommen ja dieSoldaten nicht, aber du bist ja auch noch keiner, sondern willst ersteiner werden.""Schlafen sie ganz ohne Federbetten, die Soldaten?" fragte Gebhardnachdenklich, "dann will ich's doch auch ohne versuchen.""Willst du? Das ist recht! Weisst du, Federn sind so etwas weiches,warmes, je weniger ein Bub davon wissen will, um so besser.""Also weg damit!" rief der kleine Mann, "Grossmutter, wohin?"Er packte das Federbett. Aber Helene legte die Hand darauf. "O, bitte,Mutter," sagte sie, "es ist doch zu kalt fuer das Kind, er ist es nichtgewoehnt.""So lassen wir das Bett hier. Du kannst es Nachts damit halten wie duwillst. Und sieh, da habe ich Platz gemacht fuer deine Kleider." Sieschloss einen grossen, altertuemlichen Kleiderschrank auf. "Hier hereinkannst du deine Kleider haengen.""Ich will ihm helfen, sie einzuraeumen," sagte Helene. Ihr war jederVorwand erwuenscht, die Aussprache weiter hinaus zu schieben. Waehrend sienun an den geoeffneten Schrank trat, erhob sich Leo, der sich schon nebenGebhards Bett gelegt hatte, folgte ihr, wurde unruhig, schob seine Nasein den Schrank und fing an, zu winseln. Sie bemerkten alle daswunderliche Gebahren. "Was ist da hinten in dem Schrank, Grossmutter,"fragte Gebhard. Sie griff hinein. "Es sind nur Kleidungsstuecke." Sieholte von den Haken, was da hing, ein Regenmantel, ein paarSommerkleider; immer aufgeregter folgte der Hund ihren Bewegungen undjetzt, da sie wieder ein Kleidungsstueck hervorzog, eine Herrnjuppe,jetzt sprang das Tier hoch und steckte seinen Kopf hinein. "Ach, das istnoch eine Juppe von deinem Vater, ist's moeglich, dass er die erkennt?""Aber freilich, Grossmutter, sieh nur, wie er schnueffelt, wie er sichfreut und daran zerrt!" Ein Ruck--und der Hund hatte die Juppe auf denBoden gezogen. Er legte sich daneben, streckte die Vordertatzen inganzer Laenge darueber, wuehlte mit Behagen den Kopf in das Kleidungsstueckund nahm so fest Besitz davon, dass es nicht raetlich schien, es ihmwegzunehmen. Gebhard warf sich neben seinem Hund auf den Boden,streichelte ihn und redete mit ihm: "Wo ist denn der Herr, wo ist deinguter Herr? Leo, denkst du an den Herrn?" Das Tier wedelte.Geruehrt von der Treue des Hundes wandte sich Helene ab, liess sichueberwaeltigt von Sehnsucht und Schmerz auf dem Feldbett nieder und weintebitterlich. Frau Dr. Stegemann setzte sich neben die junge, vonSchluchzen erschuetterte Frau und redete ihr in einem weichen,muetterlichen Ton zu, den Helene noch nie von ihr gehoert hatte. Daschwand allmaehlich ihre Furcht und es ueberkam sie der Trieb, der Mutterihres Mannes das ganze Leid anzuvertrauen. Sie raffte ihre Kraftzusammen. "Mutter," sagte sie, "es ist ja alles viel, vielschrecklicher, als du ahnst!""Wie so? Weisst du mehr, als was du mir geschrieben hast? Hast duNachricht von Rudolf? Schlechte Nachricht?""Nein, nein; kein Wort habe ich von ihm gehoert seit jenem Tag. Aber eswar anders als du denkst, ich kann es so schwer ueber die Lippenbringen!"Frau Dr. Stegemann richtete sich stramm auf und der weiche Ton war nichtmehr in ihrer Stimme als sie, gefasst auf die schlimmsten Mitteilungen,zur Schwiegertochter sprach: "Rede endlich, Helene. Wir duerfen nichtfeig sein in dieser harten Zeit. Ich kann alles hoeren, auch dasgrausamste. Und du musst jede Wahrheit aussprechen koennen. Sei doch auchtapfer, was hilft das Weinen?"Bei diesen Worten stand Gebhard, der neben dem Hund gelegen, auf, tratrasch an Helenens Seite und streichelte ihre Hand. "Grossmutter," riefer, "die Mutter kann nicht so tapfer sein wie du meinst, der Vater hatmir gesagt, sie ist nicht aus so hartem Holz geschnitzt wie wirStegemanns. Man muss sie immer ganz zart behandeln!" Da schlang die jungeFrau den Arm um ihren Verteidiger und sagte zu ihm: "Die Grossmutter hataber doch recht und ich will ja auch, dass sie alles erfaehrt. Gebhard,erzaehle du es, du warst ja dabei und du musst nicht immer so weinen, wieich!""Ja," sagte Gebhard, "die Grossmutter darf das wissen, sonst niemand aufder Welt!"Der kleine Mann gab sich einen Ruck, dass er stramm da stand und fing an:"Grossmutter, so war's: Zuerst kam ein deutscher Offizier mit fuenfSoldaten und besprach etwas ganz im geheimen mit dem Vater. Einstweilenkochten die Soldaten auf unserm Herd und wir halfen ihnen. Dann sagteuns der Vater, er muesse sie begleiten, aber kein Mensch duerfte wissenwohin. Sie zogen bei Nacht miteinander fort. Am naechsten Tag kam derVater allein zurueck und sagte, wir muessten schnell fliehen, die Russenkoennten bald kommen. Wir fingen gleich an, unsere Sachen auf die Wagenim Hof zu laden, aber mitten hinein kam ein ganzer Trupp Russen miteinem Offizier. Sie gingen die Treppe hinauf und ich ihnen nach. ImWohnzimmer war der Vater, aber die Mutter mit dem Juengferlein war nichtda. Der russische Offizier fragte, wohin die deutsche Patrouillegegangen sei, die heute Nacht im Forsthaus eingekehrt sei und die derVater begleitet habe. Ich weiss nicht mehr genau, was der Vater zuerstsagte, aber als der Offizier verlangte, er solle mit ihm gehen und ihndenselben Weg fuehren, da sagte der Vater: "Nein, ich bin ein guterDeutscher und werde nicht zum Verraeter." Aber der Offizier hat ihmgesagt: er koenne doch nichts machen gegen so viele und er hat ihmversprochen, er duerfte gleich wieder heimkommen, und uns allen solle garnichts geschehen; aber wenn er ihnen den Weg nicht zeige, muessten wiralle sterben. Der Vater hat aber nicht nachgegeben und es warschrecklich, wie zornig da der Offizier geworden ist, und weil ich auchgerufen habe, der Vater soll nichts verraten, haben mich die Soldatenganz wuetend gepackt und fest gehalten, da oben am Arm, wo es so weh tut,und ich habe vor lauter Zorn nur immer geschrien: "Vater, tu's nicht!Aber dann--" Gebhard stockte. Er sah die Mutter an. "Soll ich denn allessagen, Mutter, alles?""Alles, Gebhard!""Dann hat die Mutter die Schlafzimmertuere aufgeriegelt und hat von fernegerufen und gebeten, der Vater soll uns nichts geschehen lassen. DerVater hat auf die Mutter hingeschaut und dann hat er nicht mehr 'nein'sagen koennen. Er ist mit ihnen gegangen und hat versprochen, sie zufuehren. Sie sind dann fortgeritten und wir haben gedacht, der Vater kaemeam Abend wieder, der Offizier hat es ihm doch auf Ehrenwort versprochen.Das Ehrenwort muss doch ein Offizier auch im Krieg halten, nicht,Grossmutter?"Er bekam keine Antwort. Die Grossmutter, die still mit verhaltenemSchmerz den Bericht angehoert hatte, sah ins Weite, wie wenn ihre Augenden Sohn suchten, den sie verloren hatte. Helene griff nach ihren Haendenund bat leise: "Mutter, verzeih mir und verachte mich nicht ganz. Ichweiss, du waerest heldenmuetig gewesen und ich war feig, war in Todesangst;das hat er nicht mit ansehen koennen und mir zuliebe ist er zum Verraetergeworden. Ich bin schuld, dass nun diese Schuld auf seinem Gewissenliegt. Darum habe ich mich nicht entschliessen koennen, dir zu schreiben.Ich weiss ja, wie du mich verachten musst, dass ich deinen edlen Sohn dazugebracht habe.""Du hast ihn _nicht_ dazu gebracht, Helene, du irrst dich. Nichts aufder Welt haette ihn dazu bringen koennen. Ich kenne ihn. Er hat das nichtgetan!"Heftig erregt erhob sie sich. Ihr Blick fiel auf Gebhard. "Schon alsKind in deinem Alter haette er das nicht getan, wie viel weniger alsMann! Du hast das von deinem Vater geglaubt?""Ich habe es gehoert, Grossmutter, dass er 'ja' gesagt hat, und habe esselbst gesehen, dass er mit den Russen gegangen ist!""Ja. So hat er euch das Leben gerettet und die Bande fortgebracht vomForsthof. Eine Kriegslist war das. Ja, er ist mit ihnen geritten, aberwohin? Dahin, wo die deutsche Patrouille nicht war! Gebhard, kennst dudeinen Vater so wenig?"Der Knabe senkte nicht den Blick vor dem strengen Ausdruck derGrossmutter; ein glueckliches Leuchten flog ueber sein Gesicht. "So ganzgewiss weisst du das, Grossmutter? kann es gar nicht anders moeglich sein?""Gebhard, wird es jemandem gelingen, deinen Leo, dies treue Tier, gegen_dich_ zu hetzen? Wenn man ihn lockt, ihm droht? Schaeme dich, zu denken,dass irgend etwas auf der Welt deinen Vater vermocht haette, die Deutschenan ihre Feinde zu verraten!"Zaghaft warf Helene ein: "Mein Bruder sagt, wer einmal in den Haenden derRussen ist, der wird muerbe gemacht, wenn er noch so tapfer waere!""Dein _Bruder_ kann das sagen, er hat Rudolf kaum gekannt, aber du?"Nachdenklich sah sie auf Helene und dachte unwillkuerlich an die Worte:"Aus anderem Holz geschnitzt." Wie biegsam war die junge Gestalt, wieweich die Zuege und sanft der Blick! Nachsichtig sprach sie zu ihr."Weil du selbst in jener Stunde schwach warst, hast du auch ihn fuerschwach gehalten und hast doppelt darunter gelitten. Aber jetzt glaubedu mir und lass dich durch keine Einrede mehr irre machen. Dein Mann ist_kein_ Verraeter. Von den Treusten einer ist er. Glaube an ihn; einMaertyrer kann er geworden sein, ein Verraeter nicht!" Tief erregt wandtesie sich an Gebhard. "Gott gebe, dass du so wirst wie dein Vater! Einenbesseren Wunsch weiss ich nicht fuer dich!"Erschuettert verliess sie das Gemach, sie musste jetzt fuer sich alleinsein.Ihr starker Glaube ging in dieser Stunde ueber in die Seele von Mutterund Kind; die schwerste Last war der jungen Frau vom Herzen genommen.Es blieb die Trauer um den Helden, aber das war ein edler Schmerz, derihr Herz erhob. "Gebhard," sagte sie, "wie waren wir so verblendet undwie wollen wir von jetzt an stolz sein auf den Vater!" Und die beidenwaren fast gluecklich zu nennen in diesem Augenblick. Aber die Mutter desHelden kaempfte jetzt in ihrem Zimmer allein mit der tiefen Bewegung, indie diese Unterredung sie versetzt hatte. Sie war ueberwaeltigt von demGedanken an das Leiden ihres Sohnes. Was mochten die Feinde ihm angetanhaben in der Wut darueber, dass er ihnen nicht den rechten Weg wies? Dasgraesslichste, das sie ersinnen konnten. O wie grausig waren die Bilder,die ihr vorschwebten! Hin und her ging sie in ihrem Zimmer und sprachhalblaut mit ihrem Sohn, wie wenn er sie hoeren koennte: "Du mein guter,tapferer, treuer Sohn! So ganz allein. So weit fort von mir. Was habensie dir getan? Wirst du noch immer gequaelt und gepeinigt? Oder bist duerloest von allem Leid, selig aufgenommen als einer, der reinen Herzensist und Gott schauen darf? O, die schreckliche Ungewissheit!"An der Zimmertuere wurde geklopft, das Dienstmaedchen rief: "Frau Doktor,die Schustersfrau aus dem Hinterhaus ist da und fragt nach Ihnen.""Sie soll morgen kommen.""Aber sie tut ganz verzweifelt. Sie hat schlechte Nachrichten.""Ich habe auch schlechte und kann ihr keine guten verschaffen."Das Maedchen wagte nichts mehr einzuwenden; aber dem fassungslosen jungenWeib, das auf Trost und Hilfe wartete, gab sie auf eigene Verantwortungden Bescheid: "Frau Doktor kommt gleich." Sie kannte ja ihre Frau; diekonnte wohl einmal schroff und abweisend sein, aber schliesslich half siedoch immer. Auch diesmal. Nach kurzer Zeit kam sie ruhig und gefasstheraus; kaum war ihr noch anzumerken, wie sie mit sich gekaempft hatte,um wieder tapfer zu sein. Frau Siebel, die Schustersfrau, merktejedenfalls nichts davon; sie war vollstaendig vom eigenen Leidhingenommen. Ihr lauter Jammer hatte auch Helene und die Kinderherbeigerufen. Schluchzend zeigte sie eine Postkarte, die besagte, dassihr Mann schwer verwundet in der Pfalz liege und sich nach einem Besuchvon ihr sehne. "Sicher ist er schon tot," rief die junge Frau und hoertegar nicht auf die ermutigenden Worte, mit denen ihr von allen Seitenzugesprochen wurde. Sie wusste ganz gewiss, ihr Mann war tot."Dann wollen Sie also nicht in das Lazarett reisen?" fragte Frau Dr.Stegemann kurz."Ei doch," sagte Frau Siebel, "deshalb wollte ich ja Frau Doktor um Ratfragen, ich waere so gern noch diese Nacht abgereist.""So, nun sehen Sie, Sie glauben ja selbst, dass Ihr Mann noch lebt. Nunlassen Sie auch das Weinen, dazu haben Sie Zeit in der Bahn; jetztmuessen Sie fuer Ihr Kind sorgen, was machen Sie mit dem?""Das ist's ja eben, ohne mein Buberl kann ich nicht fort. Ich habe esdie neun Monate nie aus der Hand gegeben. Ich vergehe vor Angst, wennich das Kind hier lasse!""So wollen Sie es mit auf die weite Reise nehmen?""Nein, nein, das waere gar nicht auszuhalten, es zahnt und schreit soviel!""Dann muessen wir eben eine Unterkunft suchen fuer den Kleinen. Am bestenin der Krippe.""Mein Kind in die Krippe? Ach Gott, ich vergehe vor Heimweh nach demKind!""Wenn Sie unter allen Umstaenden vergehen, kann ich Ihnen auch nichthelfen," entgegnete Frau Stegemann ungeduldig. "Entweder mitnehmen oderhier lassen--eines von beiden muessen Sie doch tun. Oder wissen Sieeinen dritten Weg?""Ach nein--aber--""Nun also. Seien Sie recht dankbar, dass wir eine Krippe haben, in derman so einen kleinen Schreihals freundlich aufnimmt. Fuer heute nachtwill ich das Kind nehmen und morgen in der Krippe nachfragen. Jedenfallssorge ich fuer eine gute Unterkunft.""Aber kann ich Ihnen denn das zumuten? Es ist doch gar zu viel!""Im Krieg hilft man zusammen. Ihr Mann ist ja auch fuer uns im Kugelregengestanden! So sorgen wir auch fuer sein Kind. Haben Sie denn dasReisegeld?""Ich hoffe, dass es reicht!""Mit Hoffnungen kommen Sie am Schalter nicht aus. Ich will im Kursbuchnachsehen und Ihnen im Notfall etwas vorstrecken. Gehen Sie einstweilenund richten Sie alles!""Ach, ich bin ganz wirr im Kopf vor Schrecken!""Das passt jetzt gar nicht. Im Gegenteil, Sie muessen Ihre Gedanken festzusammennehmen, damit Sie nichts vergessen."Die Frau eilte davon, Frau Dr. Stegemann ging in die Kueche zum Maedchen.Das hatte die Verhandlung gehoert. "Frau Doktor," sagte sie, "wenn ichnur haette dazwischen reden duerfen. Das Kind ist nicht gut zu haben, dieFrau ist so unvernuenftig mit ihm, traegt es und kocht ihm bei Nacht, alleLeute im Hinterhaus sagen es. Frau Doktor, jetzt wird's doch zuviel fueruns!""Zuviel? Liese, im Kriegsjahr gibt's kein 'zuviel' fuer mich, und fuer Siehoffentlich auch nicht!""Aber seine Nachtruhe kann man doch wenigstens verlangen.""Meinen Sie? Fragen Sie doch Ihren Braeutigam, ob er sagen darf: 'BeiNacht wird mir das Schiessen zuviel, da will ich meine Ruhe!'""Wenn man auch immer an den Krieg denkt! Das tun nur Sie, Frau Doktor!""Sie doch auch, Liese? Haben wir nicht miteinander zuerst das Backenabgestellt, und die Kuebel fuer das Schweinefutter eingefuehrt, und nichtgeruht, bis sie nach und nach in der ganzen Strasse herauskamen? Ichmoechte jetzt gar keinen Menschen um mich haben, der nicht immerfortfuehlt: 'Jetzt ist Krieg, wie helfe ich?'"Liese ueberlegte. "Dann will ich eben den kleinen Balg nehmen bei Nacht.""Den nehme ich schon selbst, denn Sie muessen morgens frueh heraus."Aber weder die Frau noch die Magd bekamen den kleinen "Balg" ans Bett,denn, als Frau Siebel das schlafende Kind brachte, streckte Helene dieArme nach ihm aus, fand es reizend in seiner Unschuld und bat soherzlich es ihr zu ueberlassen, dass niemand ihr die Freude nehmen wollte.Getrost konnte Frau Siebel ihren Liebling verlassen.In spaeter Abendstunde setzten Mutter und Schwiegertochter sich noch einwenig zusammen. "Mir ist es, wie wenn ich in eine andere Welt versetztwaere," sagte Helene. "In deinem Haus weht ein ganz anderer Geist als beiuns. Ihr alle steht im Zeichen des Krieges. In meines Bruders Haus istdas nicht so, er ist von seinem Geschaeft hingenommen; auch wusste er, dassich nichts hoeren wollte vom Krieg. Ja, ich gestehe dir's, nicht einmalan den Siegen konnte ich mich freuen, weil ich immer dabei empfand: meinMann gehoert nicht zu den Helden, ich selbst habe ihn hinausgedraengt ausder tapferen Schar. Jetzt aber hast du diesen Druck von mir genommen;ich bin so gluecklich und bitte dich: verachte mich nicht um meinerFeigheit willen. Vielleicht kann ich auch noch tapfer werden; meinst dunicht?"Liebevoll zog die Mutter sie an sich."Wer weiss," sagte sie, "ob ich als junge Frau die Probe bestanden haette,angesichts der rohen Maenner, die mit ihren Scheusslichkeiten die Frauenbedrohen. Niemand soll da ueber andere urteilen. Du wirst noch vielGelegenheit haben, dich in Tapferkeit zu ueben, und ich auch. Wie langewerden wir in Unsicherheit bleiben muessen ueber das Schicksal unseresHelden. Und wenn eine Nachricht kommt, dann lautet sie vielleicht sograuenvoll, dass wir allen Mut brauchen, um sie zu ertragen. Aber es wirduns leichter werden, weil wir uns jetzt zusammen gefunden haben. Es istgut, dass du gekommen bist!""Ich moechte in dieser Zeit viel lieber bei dir leben. Aber ich muss dochbei der Kleinen bleiben, und die macht so viel Arbeit mit der Waescheund mit dem Ausfahren. Bei meinen Geschwistern mit den beidenDienstmaedchen geht das viel leichter als hier. Sie nehmen mir alleArbeit ab; meine Schwaegerin ist ruehrend besorgt und verwoehnt mich ganz.""Ich bin nicht fuer solch ruehrend verwoehnende Liebe," war der MutterAntwort. "Aber," fuegte sie hinzu, "richte du dein Leben ein, wie du esfuer richtig haeltst."Helene wurde nachdenklich. Nach einer Weile sagte sie: "Fuer Gebhard istes ja viel schoener hier. Meinen Geschwistern ist er fremd geblieben under war auch gegen mich nicht mehr so zutraulich wie frueher. Erst hierist er wieder ganz mein lieber, praechtiger Bub. Mutter, lass ihn mirnicht fremd werden!"Helene blieb bis ueber die Weihnachtsferien und fuehrte selbst nochGebhard in die Schule ein. Sie sah, wie er jetzt dem Lehrer und denMitschuelern frei und offen gegenuebertrat, da er nichts mehr zuverheimlichen hatte, und dass dem Kind warme Teilnahme entgegengebrachtwurde. Und als er am zweiten Tag in der Pause seinen Leo holte, um ihnden Kameraden vorzustellen, da wusste sie, dass er heimisch wurde unterdiesen. Sie konnte ihn getrost verlassen. Sie selbst aber vermisste aufder Heimfahrt ihren kleinen Reisekameraden und es war ihr, als entferntesie sich noch mehr von ihrem Mann, indem sie seinen Sohn und seineMutter verliess. Aber daneben wurde doch die Sehnsucht nach demToechterlein immer lebhafter. Es schlief, als sie heim kam. BeimErwachen sah es befremdet nach der Mutter; fuer das kleine Menschenkindwar die Zeit lang genug gewesen, um sie zu vergessen; aber dieErinnerung erwachte bald wieder. Es war ein lieblicher Anblick, wie diejunge Mutter mit Kosen und Schmeicheln das Fremdsein besiegte undendlich von ihrem kleinen Ebenbild durch strahlendes Laecheln undzaertliche Hingabe wieder anerkannt wurde. Die Geschwister hatten es mitangesehen. "Wie erfrischt du aussiehst!" sagte der Bruder, "du hast dichso schwer zu der Reise entschlossen, aber sie hat dir sichtlich gutgetan.""Ja, ja. Das Schwerste, was mich am meisten bedrueckt hatte, das hat mirdie Mutter abgenommen. Ich habe ihr alles, alles anvertraut und das wargut, denn es ist ganz anders, als wir uns gedacht hatten: Nur um dieRussen vom Haus wegzubringen und um sie falsch zu fuehren, ist mein Mannmit ihnen gegangen. Er hat ihnen nichts verraten!""Woher habt ihr Nachricht bekommen? Erzaehle doch!" riefen dieGeschwister."Nachricht haben wir nicht, aber die Mutter weiss es dennoch, so gewisswie wenn sie Nachricht haette. Sie kennt ihn und weiss, dass es ihm ganzunmoeglich ist, die Deutschen zu verraten.""Ach so!" sagte der Bruder gedehnt. Enttaeuschung und Unglaube lag inseinem Ton. Aber Helene sprach eifrig weiter: "Und ich bin auch festueberzeugt, dass sie recht hat. Sie hat mir erzaehlt, wie er schon als Bubso tapfer und treu war, aehnlich wie ja auch Gebhard ist, durch unddurch zuverlaessig. Ich haette es ja selbst wissen koennen, aber ich warwie verblendet, weil ich selbst feig gewesen bin und mir das so schwerauf dem Gewissen lag." Bruder und Schwaegerin schwiegen.Helene fuehlte, sie waren nicht ueberzeugt. Was konnte sie noch sagen?"Wenn ihr nur selbst seine Mutter gehoert haettet, und sie sehen koenntet,wie sie so fest und wahr ist und wie sie und ihr ganzes Haus von demerfuellt ist, was fuer den Krieg, fuers Vaterland geschehen muss. Ein ganzanderer Geist weht bei ihr als bei uns!""Bitte sehr," wehrte der Bruder, "bei uns geschieht alles was recht istund noch nie ist einer aus unserer Familie wegen Verrat in Verdachtgekommen!""Ihr sollt auch von meinem Mann nichts Schlechtes mehr glauben, nein ihrduerft es gar nicht mehr fuer moeglich halten, das kann ich nicht mehrertragen!" Sie zitterte vor Erregung.Die Schwaegerin beruhigte sie: "Rege dich nicht auf, Helene, ich glaubedir ja, aber von deinem Bruder kannst du das nicht gleich verlangen;Maenner geben nicht so viel darauf, wenn eine Mutter sagt: das kann meinSohn nicht getan haben, denn keine Mutter will Schlechtes von ihrem Sohnglauben. Maenner glauben erst, wenn Beweise vorliegen."Beweise? Nein, _Beweise_ fuer seine Unschuld hatte Helene nicht, nur denGlauben daran; den Glauben, der sie so gluecklich gemacht hatte. O, nurfest daran halten und sich nicht irre machen lassen!Sie sprachen nicht weiter darueber, denn keines wollte das anderereizen. Freundlich fuehrte Herr Kurz seine Schwester an den reichbesetzten Tisch. Aber was sie noch vor wenigen Tagen harmlos angenommenhatte, machte ihr jetzt Bedenken. Kriegsmaessig war das nicht, was hieraufgetischt wurde. Die Geschwister liessen sich nichts abgehen, dachtenauch nicht weiter daran, welche Nahrungsmittel knapp waren im Land,welche verbraucht werden sollten. Doch wagte sie nicht, dem Bruderwieder das Haus Stegemann als Vorbild zu ruehmen. So schwieg sie darueber.Aber waehrend sie die ueppige Mahlzeit mit ihnen teilte, bedrueckte es sie,die Gastfreundschaft zu geniessen von Menschen, die ihrem Mann Schlechteszutrauten; sie konnte sich nicht wohl fuehlen bei ihnen, trotz allerLiebe, die sie ihr erwiesen. In den Wochen, die nun kamen, kaempfte sieeinen schweren Kampf gegen das Heimweh nach ihrem verlorenen Glueck undgegen die Sehnsucht bei denen zu sein, die mit ihr durch die Liebe zuihrem Manne verbunden waren. Sie klammerte sich an den Trost, den ihrdie treuen Briefe der Mutter brachten, und schrieb fast taeglich an sieund an Gebhard. In seinen kindlichen Briefen suchte sie nach denseltenen Worten, die etwas von der Anhaenglichkeit aussprachen, die ihrso kostbar war. So vergingen ihr die dunklen Wintermonate langsam undschwer.Achtes Kapitel.Unter dem offenen Tor des Schulhofes stand Gebhard mit einigenKameraden. Auch Leo war dabei. Er war heute wie so manchesmal gekommen,seinen kleinen Herrn abzuholen. Es genuegte, dass Frau Dr. Stegemann demTier die Tuere oeffnete und sagte: "Such den Herrn!" Er sprang dann ingrossen Saetzen der Schule zu, wartete am Hoftor, bis sich die Klassenentleerten, erkannte sofort die Klasse, zu welcher Gebhard gehoerte,draengte sich zwischen den Schuljungen hindurch zu dem einen, dem erangehoerte. Viele der Kameraden hatten ihren Spass daran, einer beachteteden Hund noch ganz besonders; ein lebhafter Pfaelzer war es. Er hatteeinen Vetter, der Sanitaetshundefuehrer gewesen, jetzt aber verwundet imLazarett untergebracht war. Dem hatte er schon oft von Gebhards Hundgesprochen, und ebenso erzaehlte er Gebhard viel von den Leistungen desHundefuehrers. So waren die beiden laengst begierig, sich kennen zulernen. Heute nun, als Gebhard aus dem Schulhof trat, stand da an derMauer ein Feldgrauer, den Arm in der Binde. Ein ganz junger Soldat wares, sah stramm und gesund aus. "Das ist der Sanitaetshundefuehrer," sagteder kleine Pfaelzer und der Soldat begruesste Gebhard freundlich: "Ichwollte mir nur einmal deinen Hund besehen," sagte er, "ich muss sagen, ergefaellt mir wohl! Wie ein Pfeil ist er die Strasse daher gesaust und dannregungslos am Tor stehen geblieben. Die Buben von der andern Klasse hater gar nicht beachtet. Es ist ein gut gezogenes Tier. Ich gehe naemlichwieder als Hundefuehrer hinaus und da muss ich mich halt jetzt umsehennach einem andern Hund, denn der meinige ist im Feld geblieben."Gebhard sah den Soldaten, der immer pruefend auf den Hund blickte, mitgrossen Augen an. "Aber meinen gebe ich nicht her!"Der Hundefuehrer wandte sich an seinen jungen Vetter. "Ich war derMeinung, er sei zu verkaufen, du hast doch so etwas gesagt?" DerSchlingel lachte."Bloss damit du einmal an die Schule kommst und den Hund anschaust, obder wohl zum Sanitaetshund gut waere.""Ja," sagte Gebhard, "dann ginge ich, wenn ich gross bin auch als Fuehrermit ihm in den Krieg."Der Feldgraue lachte: "O Buben, was schwaetzt ihr! Bis ihr gross seid, istdoch der Krieg laengst aus und _so_ aus, dass nicht gleich wieder jemandsich traut mit uns anzubinden. Und der Hund waere auch bis dahin zu alt,jetzt waere er gerade recht. Aber ich glaub's gern, dass du ihn nichthergibst," sagte er freundlich zu Gebhard, dessen Hand streichelnd aufLeos Kopf ruhte. Dieser Ton ermutigte Gebhard zu Fragen, die ihn laengstbeschaeftigt hatten."Ich kann mir gar nicht denken," sagte er, "wie ich meinen Hund lehrensollte, dass er Fremde aufsucht, Verwundete. Wie haben Sie denn dasgemacht?""Das ist nicht so schnell gesagt und hat ja fuer dich auch keinen Wert.""Ich haette es nur so gern gewusst."Der kleine Vetter legte sich ins Mittel. "Du kannst es ihm doch sagen!""Wenn ihr einmal herauskommt auf das Gelaende hinter dem Lazarett, kannich's euch zeigen.""Vielleicht gleich naechsten Mittwoch? Da haben wir frei," rief Gebhard."Nun also, Mittwoch, um 3 Uhr. Ausgemacht!"Gebhard kam ganz im Glueck ueber diesen Vorschlag nach Hause. DieGrossmutter war gleich fuer den Plan zu haben. Aber am Mittwoch Nachmittagwirbelte Schnee und Regen durcheinander, es war zweifelhaft, ob derVerwundete bei diesem Unwetter ausgehen durfte. Missmutig stand Gebhardam Fenster, schaute hinunter auf die Strasse, ob es denn wirklich soschlimm aussaehe. Nur wenige Menschen waren zu sehen, unter diesen aberein Soldat, ein junger Feldgrauer, und der--Gebhard sah es mitzunehmender Erregung--der war kein anderer als der Hundefuehrer und kamgeradewegs auf das Haus zu, drueckte auch schon auf den Klingelknopf!Gebhard stuerzte hinaus, oeffnete und wurde ganz rot vor stolzer,freudiger Erregung, dass dieser Feldgraue zu ihm kam. Zwar wollte dernicht ins Zimmer hereinkommen, sondern bloss sagen, dass er bei demschlechten Wetter die Uebung leider nicht machen duerfe; aber er wurdebald mit warmen Worten von Frau Dr. Stegemann wie von den beidenEnkelinnen ueberredet, in das Wohnzimmer zu kommen und sich an denKaffeetisch zu setzen. Einen Feldgrauen zu Gast zu haben, war immereine Freude und so ein Sanitaetshundefuehrer war noch ganz besonderswillkommen. Die Hausfrau verstand es, den bescheidenen jungen Mann zumSprechen zu bringen. Im September war es gewesen, da hatte er, dersiebzehnjaehrige Freiwillige, zum erstenmal seinen Hund erproben koennen."Das war im Gefecht bei Ch.," erzaehlte er, "die Unsrigen hatten einenharten Stand gegen die Uebermacht; aber am Nachmittag musste der Feindweichen. Unsere Kompagnie sammelte sich, die Sanitaeter suchten dieVerwundeten auf und die Kameraden trugen die Toten zusammen. Am Abendwurden alle Namen festgestellt; da hiess es: Es fehlen noch 5 Mann.Jetzt, wo sind die? Niemand konnte Auskunft geben. Auf dem Feld lagkeiner mehr, aber vielleicht im Wald. Von dem Argonnerwald macht mansich aber bei uns keinen Begriff, der ist so dicht mit Unterholz undGestruepp verwachsen, dass man gar nicht vorwaerts kommt; wenigstens ist'sso in der Gegend, wo wir waren. Wenn sich da ein Mensch hineinverschlupft, sieht man ihn beim hellen Tag nicht, geschweige in derNacht. Also fuenf fehlen. Soll man die liegen lassen? Vielleichtverbluten sie sich oder holen sie sich den Tod auf dem nassen, kaltenWaldboden. Ich war bei unserer Truppe der einzige, der einen Hund hatte.Jetzt, denke ich, muss der seine Kunst zeigen. Ich fuehre ihn in derDunkelheit bis dicht an den Wald, dann mache ich ihn los vom Strick undgeb ihm den Befehl: 'Such verwundet.' Der Hund saust gleich davon, inden Wald hinein. Eine Weile hoere ich noch rascheln und knacken, dannwird's ganz still und ich steh da im Nebel und es rieselt eiskalt aufmich herunter und wird mir ganz unheimlich, so allein in derstockfinsteren Nacht. Mein elektrisches Laempchen habe ich wohl in derTasche, aber das spart man fuer die aeusserste Not. Ich weiss nicht, wielang das waehrte, mir kam's eine Ewigkeit vor, da hoere ich in der Ferneso ein kurzes, wiederholtes Bellen und merke gleich: Mein Tell hat einengefunden! Da ist mir's siedheiss vor Freude aufgestiegen, ich pfeife undlass mein Laempchen in den Wald blitzen und jetzt knistert und kracht eswieder und mein Tell kommt mit einer Soldatenmuetze im Maul. Schnell legeich ihm die Leine an und rufe ihm zu: 'Fuehr mich!' Er zieht an und fuehrtmich durchs Dickicht am Waldessaum eine ganze Strecke. Da bleibt erploetzlich stehen. Ich hoere ein Stoehnen und sehe vor mir einen unsererVermissten, ein Landwehrmann war's. Wie hat der Mensch sich gefreut undwie war er dankbar fuer einen Schluck aus meiner Feldflasche! Einen Schussin den Oberschenkel hatte er, und so grossen Blutverlust, er hat sichnicht ruehren koennen vor Schwaeche und Schmerzen. Ich habe ihm einenNotverband angelegt, habe ihn mit seinem Mantel gut zugedeckt und ihmversprochen, dass ihn die Traeger holen wuerden. Allein haette ich ja denWeg in der Nacht nicht zurueckgefunden, es war mir selbst wie ein Wunder,dass mich mein Tell wieder herausgeleitet hat aus dem finstern Wald undbis zur Truppe. Dort waren gleich ein paar von unseren Leuten bereit,den Verwundeten mit der Bahre zu holen. Mein Tell hat uns wiedergefuehrt und wir haben unsern Landwehrmann gluecklich zum Verbandplatzgebracht. In derselben Nacht haben wir noch einen zweiten aufgespuert underrettet. Die andern fand Tell gegen Morgen; einer war aber schonverblutet. Haetten wir mehr Hunde mit Fuehrern gehabt, waere der vielleichtauch noch gerettet worden."Der Soldat schien fertig mit seiner Erzaehlung; aber alle haetten gernnoch mehr gehoert."Bei welcher Gelegenheit sind Sie denn zu Ihrer Verwundung gekommen?"fragte Frau Dr. Stegemann."Ja, das war eben einmal, wo unsere Verwundeten ganz nahe am Feindlagen. Das ist immer das gefaehrlichste. Wenn es so steht, dann bindetman den Hunden den Fang zu, dass sie keinen Laut geben koennen; das habensie zwar nicht gern. Mein Tell hat sich's anfangs gar nicht gefallenlassen; aber er hat es doch gelernt. Auch wie ich das letzte Mal mit ihmdraussen war und mit den Traegern ganz nahe an den vorderstenSchuetzengraben der Franzosen gekommen bin, hat er uns nicht verraten,sondern hat uns lautlos herangefuehrt; aber die Verwundeten habengestoehnt und um Hilfe gerufen, wie sie uns bemerkten. Darauf ist dieSchiesserei bei den Franzosen losgegangen. Sie haben aber nur michgetroffen, so dass ich noch selbst habe zurueckgehen und mit der linkenHand den Hund fuehren koennen; unsere Leute haetten sonst in der Nachtnicht zurueckgefunden. So haben wir doch unsere Verwundeten nochgerettet, das hat mich riesig gefreut. Nachher bin ich ohnmaechtiggeworden; und wie ich im Lazarett aufgewacht bin, haben mir dieKameraden gleich zugerufen, ich bekaeme das Eiserne Kreuz. Nun, ichwill's spaeter noch besser verdienen; sobald es nur angeht, ziehe ichwieder hinaus. Mein Tell wird jetzt von einem Kameraden gefuehrt, und ichmuss schauen, dass ich wieder einen Hund abrichte. Er muss halt folgen undklug sein, bissig darf er auch nicht sein und nicht mit andern Hundenraufen oder auf Wild jagen. Es gibt nicht viele solche und wer so einTier hat, der verkauft's nicht, gelt du?" Er wandte sich mit dieserFrage an Gebhard. Aber Grete und Else, die beiden lebhaften Maedchen, dienicht weniger eifrig als Gebhard dem Soldaten zugehoert hatten, liessenihn nicht zur Antwort kommen: "Ich wuerde meinen Hund gleich verkaufen!"rief Grete mit Begeisterung! Und Else: "Ich auch, recht teuer; um dasGeld wuerde ich lauter Sockenwolle, Zigarren und Schokolade kaufen undPaeckchen an die Soldaten schicken oder ich gaebe es fuer die Ostpreussen.""Die Fraeulein haben gut reden," sagte der Soldat, "die haben keinen Hundund wissen nicht, wie lieb man solch ein Tier hat. Ich haette meinen Tellauch um viel Geld nicht hergegeben, ich kann's von einem andern auchnicht verlangen. Wo hast du denn deinen Leo?""Im Hof.""Da hast du recht. Lass ihn nicht viel ins Zimmer, sonst wird erverweichlicht."Der Soldat hatte sich neben dem Erzaehlen den Kaffee wacker schmeckenlassen; Frau Dr. Stegemann nahm die leere Kanne, ging hinaus, zu sehen,ob draussen noch Vorrat waere. Gebhard folgte ihr in die Kueche."Grossmutter, gelt, ich muss meinen Leo nicht hergeben?""Niemand kann das von dir verlangen.""Grossmutter, gelt der Soldat hat recht, Grete und Else wissen nicht, wiegern ich meinen Leo habe, aber du weisst es doch, Grossmutter!""Ich weiss es freilich, er ist dein liebster, treuster Kamerad! Und erist dir auch ein Andenken an den Vater, ans Forsthaus, an die liebe,alte Heimat. Du wuerdest ihn alle Tage vermissen, weil dein Herz an ihmhaengt.""Ja, ja, gerade so ist's wie du dir's denkst, Grossmutter. Leo koennte esauch gar nicht verstehen. Vorhin war's mir, als muesste ich ihn hergeben,weil man ihn im Krieg so noetig brauchen koennte, aber ich bin froh, dassdu selbst sagst, ich soll ihn behalten.""Das habe ich nicht gesagt, Gebhard, und kann es auch nicht sagen. Nurdu selbst kannst wissen, ob du dein Liebstes fuers Vaterland hergebenmusst oder nicht!""Nein, Grossmutter, sage mir, was du meinst.""Ich meine, du gehst jetzt einmal hinunter zu deinem Leo und ich trageden Kaffee in das Zimmer!""Ich will aber doch wissen, was du denkst!"Die Grossmutter ueberhoerte den aergerlichen Ausruf ihres Enkels und kehrtein das Zimmer zurueck. Gebhard stand noch einen Augenblick voll Aergerund Unmut da, dann tat er doch, was die Grossmutter gesagt; er ginghinunter in den Hof, an dessen Zaun der Hund sofort hoch sprang undfreudig seinen kleinen Herrn begruesste, der ihn diesmal mit stuermischerZaertlichkeit umschlang und ihm einmal ums andere zurief: "Du wirst nichtverkauft, Leo, nein, nein! Wir zwei bleiben beisammen!"Droben im Zimmer machte der bescheidene junge Gast Umstaende, noch weiterdem Kaffee zuzusprechen und noch laenger zu verweilen."Ich meine," sagte die Grossmutter, "nach dem wochenlangen Lazarettlebenduerfen Sie sich's wohl einmal wieder behaglich machen in einemFamilienzimmer. Sagen wir: noch eine Tasse, eine Zigarre und eineViertelstunde plaudern, und dann soll's genug sein. Wir gehen dann auchwieder an unsere Arbeit.""Ja, so ist's fein," meinte der junge Mann, sah auf seine Taschenuhr undgab sich noch einmal dem seltenen Genuss hin, am behaglichenFamilientisch zu sitzen und von seinem Elternhaus erzaehlen zu duerfen.Die Viertelstunde war fast verstrichen, da kam auch Gebhard wiederherauf und trat ins Zimmer, seinen Leo an einer kurzen Leine fuehrend.Stramm ging er auf den Soldaten zu, hochgemut leuchteten seine Augen; erglich selbst schon einem Fuehrer, der mit seinem Hund einen schweren Gangwagen will.Der Soldat unterbrach seine Erzaehlung und wandte sich dem Knaben zu. Dertrat dicht heran und rief seinem Hund zu: "Leo leg dich still!" Das Tierlegte sich gehorsam neben den fremden Mann. Nun reichte Gebhard demSoldaten die Leine und sagte fest: "Ich schenke meinen Leo demVaterland." Er liess die Leine los, sie lag nun in des Fuehrers Hand. Derjunge Soldat fand gar nicht gleich Worte, so ueberrascht war er, sobewegt, als er sah, wie Gebhard zu seiner Grossmutter trat und zu ihrsagte: "Ich habe es _doch_ tun muessen, Grossmutter!"Sie zog ihn an sich heran. "Es wird dich nicht reuen," sagte sie.Aber der Feldgraue machte Einwaende: "Ich kann das gar nicht annehmen vondem Kind, es tut ihm weh. Nein, das Opfer ist zu gross!""Ei was, wer wird darueber so viel Worte machen," wehrte Frau Stegemannund wandte sich an Gebhard: "So ein kleiner Bursche wie du hat nichtleicht das Glueck, dass er dem Vaterland etwas wertvolles opfern kann, dasdarf wohl auch wehtun, sonst waere es ja gar kein Opfer!""Es tut weh, Grossmutter!""Ich glaube dir's wohl, mein lieber Bub!"Sie sah, dass der kleine Mann sich mit aller Macht wehrte, die Traenenzurueckzuhalten und kam ihm zu Hilfe, indem sie sich an den Soldatenwandte."Nun werden Sie erst erproben muessen, ob Leo wirklich brauchbar ist alsSanitaetshund.""Ja, aber ich zweifle nicht, es wird sich bald zeigen. Ein feines Tierist das. Ich kann's gar nicht so aussprechen, wie dankbar ich dafuer bin.Nach dem Krieg--wenn wir's erleben--bringe ich dir aber deinen Leozurueck, Gebhard, dann soll er wieder dir gehoeren." Das war eine schoeneHoffnung, Gebhard sah schon wieder froehlich aus."Und schreiben will ich dir auch und dir berichten, wieviel er leistet.""Ja, ob er solche Verwundete aufspuert, die sonst umgekommen waeren.""Gebhard saehe wohl gerne zu, wenn Sie den Hund abrichten. Koennten Siedas einrichten?" fragte die Grossmutter."Aber natuerlich, das wollen wir schon so machen. Ich kann ja an dasSchulhaus kommen, dann verabreden wir es miteinander. Zuerst muss ich esim Lazarett melden, so lange bleibt dir dein Leo noch. Lass doch sehen,ob er sich nicht losreisst von mir, wenn du hinausgehst." Gebhard gingauf die Tuere zu, der Hund erhob sich, zog an der Leine, wolltefolgen.--"Leo, liegen bleiben!" rief ihm sein kleiner Herr zu, undverliess das Zimmer. Das Tier legte sich, aber es winselte leise. "Er istdoch sonst hie und da im Zimmer ohne Gebhard, da winselt er nie!"bemerkte Else."Er merkt, dass mir die Leine uebergeben ist und das beunruhigt ihn, Siewerden gleich sehen!" Der Soldat liess die Leine zu Boden gleiten, sofortwar der Hund still. "Ein kluges Tier! Und so fein erzogen!""Mein Sohn versteht das, Gebhards Vater.""Ist Ihr Herr Sohn auch im Feld?""Im Feld nicht, aber in russischen Haenden. Was sie ihm getan haben undob er noch lebt, das wissen wir nicht.""Oh, ich habe keine Ahnung gehabt, dass Sie so eine Sorge haben," sagteder junge Mann und stand auf. "Da sitze ich und plaudere Ihnen vor, undnehme dem Kind noch seine groesste Freude weg, das geht doch nicht.""Es geht schon. Gebhard ist ein tapferer, kleiner Mann, nach seinemVater geraten. Es ist gut, sich schon in jungen Jahren an Opfer undEntbehrungen zu gewoehnen, so wachsen Helden heran."Der Soldat verabschiedete sich, Gebhard gab ihm noch ein Stueck Weges dasGeleite. Der Hund ging zwischen ihnen, die Leine wanderte unversehensvon einer Hand in die andere. Soldaten gingen vorueber, gruessten denKameraden mit dem Hund, sahen auch freundlich nach dem kleinen Burschen,denn der gruesste heute einen jeden. Er konnte gar nicht anders. Hatte erdoch den Soldaten zu lieb seinen Leo geopfert, so sah er sie alle mitdem Gedanken an: Vielleicht rettet er euch einmal das Leben!Neuntes Kapitel.Wochen waren vergangen. Helene lag auf ihrem Ruhebett, das letzteBriefchen Gebhards in der Hand. Sie hatte sich allmaehlich daran gewoehnt,manche Stunde so liegend zu vertraeumen. Arbeit gab es nicht fuer sie indiesem Hause; fuer ihr Toechterchen war ein Kindermaedchen gedungenworden; denn die Geschwister wuenschten nicht, dass sie das Kind selbstausfahre; an dem geselligen Verkehr ihrer Schwaegerin mochte sie nichtteilnehmen, dazu war ihr Herz zu schwer. Heute war fuer sie ein besonderswehmuetiger Tag, ihr Hochzeitstag jaehrte sich zum zweiten Mal. Und siewusste nicht: war sie Witwe oder lebte der noch, der ihr ganzes Glueckgewesen?Nichts war ihr aus jener Zeit geblieben als das Kleine, das neben ihrlag und schlief. Sie schaute nach dem Kind, aber sie konnte es nichtmehr mit derselben Freude ansehen wie frueher, sie bedauerte es. Ohne denVater sollte es aufwachsen, mit einer Mutter, die nicht mehr frisch undfroehlich war wie einst. Sie kam sich selbst wie ein fluegellahmer Vogelvor. Mutlos sank sie wieder auf ihr Ruhebett zurueck. Eine Weile spaetertrat leise das Kindermaedchen ein, blickte nach der schlafenden Kleinen."Ich will nicht stoeren," sagte das Maedchen, "wollte nur die Postbringen." Sie gab einen Brief ab und verliess das Zimmer.Gleichgiltig oeffnete Helene den Umschlag. Es war ihr alles so einerlei,nur wenn von seiner Mutter ein Brief kam, das freute sie, darin wehteimmer etwas von seinem tapfern Geist. Aber dies schien von einerMaedchenhand geschrieben. Liegend las sie; es waren nur ein paar Worte,aber Worte, die sie auffahren liessen, ihr Herz klopfen machten, ihrschier unglaublich schienen, so dass sie ihren Augen nicht traute undeinmal ums andere las, was da stand: "Ihr Mann lebt und gruesst Sietausendmal!"So lebhaft war Helene aufgesprungen, dass ihr Toechterchen davonerwachte."Mam-mam," klang es aus dem Korbwagen. "Mam-mam? Ja, und Pa-pa!Juengferlein, der Papa lebt und laesst uns tausendmal gruessen!"Sie nahm das Kind heraus, drueckte es jubelnd an sich und lachte so, dassdas Kleine auf ihrem Arm ganz uebermuetig wurde. Aber nach dieser erstenueberquellenden Freude kamen der jungen Frau allerlei Fragen.--Warumschrieb ihr Mann nicht selbst? Konnte er nicht? War er so krank? Wennman nur mehr wuesste! Aber es war doch eine Spur aufgefunden, die konnteman verfolgen. Das musste sie mit seiner Mutter besprechen, zu dergehoerte sie jetzt. Ein heisses Verlangen trieb sie zu ihr und zu Gebhard;wie wuerde der jubeln!Sie eilte hinaus, um Bruder und Schwaegerin den Brief zu zeigen und sichmit ihnen zu beraten. Die Geschwister konnten zwar nicht einsehen, dassHelene auf diese Nachricht hin unbedingt abreisen muesse, aber sie hattenbeide den Eindruck, dass gegen diesen stuermischen Wunsch gar nichts zumachen sei. Sie war ja wie verwandelt, die vorher so matte,niedergeschlagene Frau. Man musste sie gewaehren lassen.So folgte Helene dem Drang ihres Herzens und frug bei der Mutter an, obsie zu ihr kommen duerfe mit dem Toechterchen und bei ihr bleiben, damitsie alle beisammen waeren, wenn ihr Mann kaeme. Er lebte--also kam er, werkonnte wissen, wie bald!Frau Dr. Stegemann antwortete sofort und hiess Helene mit dem Kindwillkommen. In Eile wurden die Reisevorbereitungen getroffen.Helene war beim Abschied bewegt. Wie gastfreundlich hatten dieGeschwister sie aufgenommen. "Ihr wart so geduldig mit mir in dieserlangen, truebseligen Zeit," sagte sie."Uns war es nicht zu lange," erwiderte der Bruder mit Herzlichkeit. "Dukannst jederzeit wiederkommen, du weisst, wir haben dich lieb!""Und ich euch, von Herzen. Aber mein Mann gehoert auch dazu. Wenn ich ihnerst wieder habe, muesst ihr ihn recht kennen lernen. Dann wird alles ganzschoen!""Gott gebe es!"Die Geschwister trennten sich, der Zug fuhr ab. Und kaum war Helene mitihrem Toechterlein allein, so zog sie wieder ihren Brief aus der Tasche;denn sie konnte nicht oft genug die Worte lesen: "Ihr Mann lebt undgruesst Sie tausendmal!"Helene hatte nichts mitgeteilt von der Botschaft, die sie erhaltenhatte. Muendlich wollte sie der Mutter die Nachricht ueberbringen, wollteihre und Gebhards Freude miterleben. Da sie nun mit einem frueheren Zug,als man sie erwartet hatte, ankam, fand sie die Wohnung fast leer, nurdas Maedchen empfing sie. So richtete sie sich ein in dem Gastzimmer,besorgte ihr Kindchen und wartete gespannt, wer zuerst heimkaeme.Immer wieder trat sie ans Fenster, sah endlich ein paar Schuljungen aufdas Haus zukommen und erkannte unter ihnen Gebhard. Die Kameraden hattensich viel zu sagen, konnten sich lange nicht trennen, sie hatten ebeneiner Uebung des Sanitaetshundes Leo beigewohnt und waren noch erfuelltdavon. Die junge Frau konnte nicht laenger warten, oeffnete das Fensterund rief Gebhards Namen; der blickte auf, loeste sich aus der Gruppe,rannte der Haustuer zu und oben angekommen umschlang er die Mutter, diestrahlend vor Freude vor ihm stand. Er hatte gar nicht mehr gewusst, dasssie so lieblich aussah, wie jetzt in ihrem Glueck, und es ueberkam ihn soploetzlich die Erinnerung, wie Vater und Mutter beisammen gewesen, dassihm Traenen in die Augen stiegen. Er begriff nicht, was ihn so bewegteund sagte hilflos: "Ich freue mich doch so, aber das ist immer so dumm,wenn man sich freuen will, dann kann man's nicht, ohne den Vater!""Doch Gebhard, jetzt koennen wir's wieder! Denn wir wissen jetzt, dass derVater lebt. Sieh nur, den Brief habe ich bekommen, darin steht: DerVater lebt und gruesst uns tausendmal!"Kaum hatte Gebhard die Nachricht erfasst, so erklang draussen einwohlbekanntes Klingeln: "Das ist die Grossmutter, darf ich's ihr sagen,Mutter?""Wir miteinander!"Sie nahmen sich an der Hand, Gebhard lachte, wie die Mutter soleichtfuessig mit ihm springen konnte. Sie kamen dem Maedchen noch zuvor.Die Grossmutter wurde von beiden Seiten umfangen und hoerte nichts als:Er lebt und gruesst uns tausendmal!Auf diese freudige Erregung folgten Wochen des Wartens. Aber siebrachten fuer Helene nicht mehr vertraeumte Stunden auf dem Ruhebett; indiesem altmodischen Haus gab es ueberhaupt gar kein Ruhebett. Frau Dr.Stegemann kannte auch keine Mittagsruhe. Sie war der Meinung, dass es fuergesunde Menschen genuege, bei Nacht zu ruhen und begriff nicht, dass jungeMenschen so viele Stunden ihres Lebens ohne Arbeit oder Vergnuegen, inblossem Nichtstun zubringen mochten. Helene fand sich schnell in dieseAuffassung und kam durch Arbeit hinweg ueber die Enttaeuschung, dass derersten Nachricht keine zweite folgte und alle Nachforschungen fruchtlosblieben. Sie besorgte ihr Kindchen selbst und war bald auch in allerleiArbeit fuer andere mit hineingezogen. Zuerst durch die jungeSchustersfrau, die inzwischen Witwe geworden war. Ihr musste man helfenVerdienst zu suchen, und dabei hoerte man von anderen, die in aehnlicheNot geraten waren.Da gab es fuer Helene viele Gaenge zu machen, aufzumuntern und Hilfe zuschaffen. Ihre beiden jungen Nichten, Else und Grete, waren eifrigeWoll- und Metallsammlerinnen fuers Vaterland, hatten auch Gebhard mithereingezogen und so gab es in der ganzen Familie kaum eine Taetigkeit,selten ein Gespraech, das nicht mit dem Krieg zusammenhing.Ueber all dem verstrich rasch die Wartezeit und ging der kalteVorfruehling ueber in einen Mai, so wonnig, dass all die Krieger im Feldund ihre Treuen daheim aufatmeten nach dem schweren Winter. Und einerdieser wonnigen Maitage loeste auch das geheimnisvolle Dunkel, das bisherueber dem Schicksal des Foersters gewaltet hatte.Helene war mit ihrem Toechterchen und den grossen Kindern den Nachmittagim Wald gewesen, nun kamen sie zurueck mit grossen Straeussen von Waldblumenund jungem Gruen; ein ganzer Fruehlingseinzug war es, als all diese Jugendheimkehrte und froehlich die Grossmutter begruesste. Die musste sichgleichzeitig von jedem erzaehlen lassen, wie schoen es im Wald gewesen,musste die Straeusse in Empfang nehmen, die fuer sie gepflueckt waren, undkonnte sich in all der Kinderunruhe kaum Gehoer verschaffen. Aber alsHelene mit den Kindern in die grosse Wohnstube ging, da folgte ihnen dieGrossmutter nicht, sondern bemerkte nebenbei zur Schwiegertochter: "Wenndu die Kleine besorgt hast, so komm zu mir herueber. Ich habe dir etwaszu sagen." Helene sah die Mutter an und ein einziger Blick verriet ihr,dass sie eine tiefe Bewegung beherrschte. Sie wusste: eine Nachricht wargekommen!"Else, Grete," bat sie, "tut ihr mir's zuliebe, die Kleine auszuziehen,Gebhard hilfst du?" Und ehe noch Antwort gekommen, setzte sie das Kind,das sie auf dem Arm gehabt, mitten unter die drei Grossen auf den Bodenund folgte der Mutter. "Ist ein Brief gekommen? Von ihm? An mich?""An mich, aber deswegen nicht weniger an dich. Komm, setze dich zu mir.Und sei tapfer, Helene!" Bei diesem Wort wurde die junge Frau blass."Sind es keine guten Nachrichten?""Wie kannst du _gute_ Nachrichten erwarten? Nicht wahr, wir haben unslaengst gesagt, dass wir aufs Schlimmste gefasst sein muessen. Aber er lebtdoch und wird wiederkommen!"Sie nahm den Brief zur Hand. "Er ist von einer Pflegeschwestergeschrieben, aus einem Berliner Lazarett, Rudolf hat ihn diktiert. Ichwill dir ihn vorlesen." Sie las mit fester Stimme:"Liebe Mutter, wie ein Traum ist mir's noch, dass ich dir einen Briefschicken kann, wie ein Wunder, dass ich wieder im deutschen Vaterlandbin. Noch vor kurzem hatte ich keine Hoffnung, je aus dem Feindeslandherauszukommen. Fremde Menschen haben sich meiner angenommen, mich miteigener Lebensgefahr ueber die Grenze gebracht. Aber bald, bald werde ichdir das alles muendlich erzaehlen, nur auf eines soll dich dieser Briefvorbereiten, ehe du mich wiedersiehst. Deine starke Seele wird esertragen, wenn ich dir sage, was mir geschehen ist. Die Russen habengrausame Rache an mir veruebt, als ich ihnen die Stellung der Deutschennicht verraten wollte. Mutter, sie haben mir das Augenlicht genommen.Ich bin blind. Und nicht nur das, ich bin auch, das weiss ich, eingrauenvoller Anblick, und dies quaelt mich vor allem bei dem Gedanken anmeine junge, weiche, fein empfindende Frau, die so etwas nicht ertragenkann." Das Vorlesen wurde unterbrochen durch einen schmerzlichenAufschrei: "O Mutter, wie grausig!" Laut schluchzend drueckte Helenebeide Haende vor das Gesicht, wie wenn sie verdecken wollte, was sie imGeist vor sich sah. Sie weinte bitterlich, es war nicht moeglich, weitervorzulesen. Mitleidig sah die Mutter auf die Trostlose. "Fasse dich,Helene; nicht wahr, wir wussten schon lange, dass er in den Haendengrausamer Feinde war, und hatten uns auf das Schlimmste vorbereitet.""Ich nicht, Mutter, ich habe mir solch schreckliche Gedanken immer ferngehalten."Das konnte Frau Stegemann nicht begreifen. In ihrer Natur lag es, festins Auge zu fassen, was kommen musste. "Helene," sagte sie vorwurfsvoll,"du wolltest doch tapfer sein!""Verzeih! Ich kann nicht, es ist zu schrecklich!" Vor der Tuere liess sicheine Stimme hoeren."Grossmutter, darf ich kommen?" und Gebhard trat ein; er sah seinMuetterlein aufgeloest in Traenen, daneben die Grossmutter mit dem strengenAusdruck, den er kannte. Ihm war er vertraut, aber die Mutter fuerchteteihn, das wusste er. Und als er sie so im Jammer sah, erregte es ihn, ervergass sich und rief mit zornigem Ausdruck, waehrend ihm die Roete insGesicht stieg: "Grossmutter, so darf man nicht mit der Mutter reden, dasssie so weinen muss, das leidet der Vater nicht!"Die Grossmutter, die ihm sonst nie solch ungebaerdiges Auftreten hingehenliess, uebersah es diesmal; denn sein ritterliches Eintreten fuer dieMutter gefiel ihr."Ich habe deine Mutter nicht traurig gemacht," sagte sie, "sonderndieser Brief, obgleich darin steht, dass der Vater bald kommt. Nun siehnur zu, wie du sie troestest. Du kannst mit ihr den Brief fertig lesen!"Sie gab das Blatt in seine Hand und verliess die beiden. Gebhard standratlos mit dem Brief, denn eine fremde Handschrift war ihm noch eineschwere Aufgabe."Vorlesen kann ich nicht," sagte er, "und troesten auch nicht."Da raffte sich Helene zusammen: "Nein, mein armer, lieber Bub, du sollstmich nicht troesten, du tust mir ja selbst so leid. Ich will dir sagen,warum ich weine: Sieh, der Vater, dein herzlieber Vater, ist blind;seine lieben, schoenen Augen sind ihm zerstoert worden aus Rache, weil erdie Deutschen nicht an die Russen verraten wollte." Sie zog ihn an sich,wie entsetzlich musste ihm, der so treu an seinem Vater hing, dieseNachricht sein! Aber es kam anders als sie dachte. Nicht Traenen kamenihm in die Augen, stolz leuchteten sie und fast frohlockend klang es:"Jetzt muessen es alle glauben, dass der Vater kein Verraeter ist, alle,auch Onkel und Tante! Mutter, schreibst du es ihnen gleich, heute noch?""Ja, ja. Jetzt haben sie den Beweis, den sie wollten! Einen soschrecklichen Beweis!" Ihr graute wieder. Aber Gebhard, dieses Kind, dasin Monaten des Krieges unter den Kameraden von viel Schrecklichem gehoertund im Lazarett allerlei Schwerverwundete gesehen hatte, konnte nichtmehr so den Schauer empfinden. "Mutter," sagte er, "droben im Lazarettist ein Soldat, dem hat eine Granate beide Augen weggerissen. Aber derhat schon oft mit dem Hundefuehrer und mir geplaudert und war ganzvergnuegt!""Wie sieht er aus, Gebhard?" ganz aengstlich klang die Frage."Ich weiss nicht, ich habe ihn nicht so genau angeschaut.""Hat er nicht furchtbare Schmerzen?""Nein, er hat sich nie beklagt und ich glaube, es wird auch dem Vaternicht mehr wehtun.""Vielleicht steht darueber noch etwas in dem Brief," sie griff darnach,denn der kleine Mann hatte sie doch getroestet, sie war wieder gefasst undlas vor. Von Schmerzen stand nichts darin. Zuversichtlich klang es:"Bald darf ich reisen; zunaechst komme ich noch nicht zu dir ins Haus,sondern mit anderen Verwundeten in ein Lazarett; dort wirst du, meinetapfere Mutter, mich besuchen. Ich weiss nicht, ob meine Lieben bei dirsind, und ueberlasse es dir, ob du Helene die ganze traurige Wahrheitmitteilen willst. Geh schonend um mit ihrem weichen Herzen; es ist mirschwer an ihren Jammer zu denken. Aber _eine_ Mitteilung weiss ich doch,die Euch freuen wird, Gebhard vor allem: Es wurde mir, der ich nichtkaempfen durfte fuers Vaterland, das Eiserne Kreuz verliehen fuer die_eine_ Stunde, in der ich meine Treue beweisen konnte, als ich dieFeinde seitab von der Spur fuehrte, die sie suchten, und ihre Rache aufmich nahm. Erst kuerzlich ist der ganze Sachverhalt zur Kenntnis derHeeresleitung gekommen."Das Eiserne Kreuz! Wie leuchteten Gebhards Augen und welcher Glanz kamueber das Gesicht der jungen Frau! Sie atmete tief auf. Nie konnte jetztmehr die alte Reue sie ueberfallen, nie durfte irgend jemand an seinerEhre zweifeln. Als ein treuer, tapferer Held, der das Schwerste auf sichgenommen hatte, stand ihr Mann vor Gott und der Welt, und ihre eigeneSchwachheit hatte seiner Ehre nicht geschadet. Maechtig wuchs ihrVerlangen nach ihm, wie wollte sie ihn lieben und pflegen und gluecklichmit ihm sein!"Wie heisst es in dem Brief? _Bald darf ich reisen._ Was heisst bald?Komm, wir muessen die Grossmutter fragen; und an meinen Bruder muss ichschreiben, gleich jetzt, komm Gebhard, komm!"Hand in Hand, in einer gleichen, grossen Freude eilten sie hinaus, dieGrossmutter aufzusuchen. Im Wohnzimmer war sie nicht zu finden, nur dieKleine sass da, im niedrigen Kinderstuehlchen; neben ihr Grete, die ihrdas Abendsueppchen gab. Im Augenblick kniete Helene neben dem Kind."Gebhard, wir muessen es dem Juengferlein auch sagen, dass der Vater kommt.Hoerst du, Juengferlein? Sag: Papa!""Mam-ma!" rief die Kleine."Papa," wiederholte die Mutter, "Papa," bat Gebhard, "Papa" sagte Elsevor. Verwundert, schaute das Kind von einem zum andern, spitzte endlichdas Maeulchen, machte sichtlich eine grosse Anstrengung und rief--"Mama!"Da lachten alle zusammen.Frau Dr. Stegemann war nebenan und hoerte das Lachen; hell und froehlichklang die Stimme der jungen Frau, die sie vor kurzem aufgeloest inTraenen verlassen hatte."O Jugend!" sagte die Grossmutter vor sich hin; aber ihr ernstes Gesichterheiterte sich. "Es ist gut so. Komm nur, mein armer Blinder, es gibtdoch noch Herzensfreude fuer dich. Gottlob, dies Lachen hoerst ja auch du,so gut wie wir, und viele innige Worte der Liebe wird dir deine Frauzufluestern, die nur du hoeren wirst!"Zehntes Kapitel.An diesem Nachmittag, als Gebhard in das Lazarett ging, um den Soldatenabzuholen, der eine letzte Probe mit Leo, dem geschulten Sanitaetshund,abhalten wollte, begleitete ihn Helene. Auf dem Weg vertraute sieGebhard an, dass sie nicht nur wegen des Hundes mit ihm ginge. Nein, siehatte vor, den Verwundeten zu besuchen, der durch Granatsplitter umseine Augen gekommen war. Es graute ihr vor seinem Anblick, aber siewollte sich daran gewoehnen, ehe der Vater kam. So gingen sie miteinandervor die Stadt hinaus nach dem Lazarett und sie betrat es mit Bangen.Gebhard fuehrte die Mutter die Treppe hinauf. Oben trafen sie diePflegeschwester. "Heute kommt meine Mutter mit," sagte Gebhard, undHelene brachte schuechtern und zaghaft den Wunsch vor, den Blinden zusehen. "Da kommen Sie gerade noch rechtzeitig," antwortete dieSchwester, "ehe er zum Unterricht geht, in die Anstalt gegenueber." Siebetraten einen kleinen Saal mit mehreren Betten, die meisten standenleer, denn die Verwundeten waren schon so weit hergestellt, dass sie sichim Garten aufhalten konnten; aber einer stand am weit geoeffnetenFenster, durch das der Duft bluehender Linden hereinstroemte. "Das ist derBlinde," sagte Gebhard und fuehrte ihm die Mutter zu. Helene blickte zuihm auf. Nein, es war kein schlimmer Anblick: ein Band war um seineStirne gebunden und an diesem waren zwei kleine Tuechlein befestigt, diedie Augenhoehlen verdeckten. Sie gab dem Verwundeten die Hand. "Mein Mannhat auch beide Augen verloren," sagte sie mit tiefer Bewegung. DerBlinde hoerte es ihrem Ton an. "Es ist freilich traurig," sagte er, "auchfuer die Frauen. Die meinige hat auch gejammert. Aber man muss es halthinnehmen und auf Gott vertrauen. Wenn man erst eine Beschaeftigunggelernt hat, wird einem die Zeit nicht mehr so lang. Ich habe jedenNachmittag Unterricht.""Darf ich manchmal vormittags zu Ihnen kommen und Ihnen etwas vorlesen?""Ja, das waere mir wohl recht."Ein Verwundeter, den Arm in der Binde, kam, er fuehrte den blindenKameraden zum Unterricht. Helene verabschiedete sich. Draussen sprach siemit der Schwester. "Darf ich oefter kommen?" fragte sie, "ich moechte sogerne mehr von ihm hoeren," und zaghaft fuegte sie hinzu: "Ich moechte ihnauch ohne die Binde sehen.""Ja, kommen Sie nur, so oft Sie wollen. Die Binde traegt er bloss, wenner ueber die Strasse geht. Sie werden sich schnell an den Anblickgewoehnen--wir Schwestern und seine Kameraden denken gar nicht mehrdaran, das ist nicht so schlimm!"Erleichterten Herzens verliess Helene das Gebaeude. Der Blinde, dieKameraden, die Schwester, sie alle waren so ruhig gewesen. Es war nichtso schwer, als sie sich eingebildet hatte, gewiss nicht. Gleich morgenwollte sie wiederkommen, denn wer konnte wissen, wann ihr eigenergeliebter Blinder kommen wuerde? Jeden Tag konnte das sein und er solltesie nicht mehr feig und schwach sehen, nein, wahrhaftig, er verdienteeine tapfere Frau, und das wollte sie ihm sein!Im Hof unten wartete schon neben seinem neuen Herrn stehend Leo, derSanitaetshund. Er trug heute zum erstenmal die feldgraue, mit dem rotenKreuz geschmueckte Decke. Mit freudigem Bellen sprang er auf Gebhard zu."Heute sollst du sein Meisterstueck sehen, Gebhard," sagte derHundefuehrer. "Morgen wird's aber auch ernst, wir reisen in aller Frueheab, gleich an die Front!"Drei Soldaten waren schon vorausgegangen mit dem Auftrag, sich auf einerkleinen Anhoehe in dem nahen Wald zu verstecken. Sie sollten dieVerwundeten vorstellen, die aufzusuchen waeren. Auf einem andern Wegfolgte nun der Fuehrer mit dem Hund. Ihm schlossen sich Helene undGebhard an. "Im Kasernenhof haben wir schon aehnliche Uebungen mit demHund gemacht," sagte der Fuehrer, "aber im Wald noch nie. Ich bin abersicher, er wird auch da seine Sache gut machen." Oben angekommen, liesser den Hund von der Leine los und rief ihm aufmunternd zu: "Leo, suchverwundet!"Pflichteifrig raste der Hund im ersten Augenblick geradeaus. Dann schiener sich zu besinnen, schnueffelte da und dort, aufgeregt, immer die Naseauf dem Boden. Allmaehlich naeherte er sich dem Wald."Am Waldrand ist ein Bach," sagte der Fuehrer. "Der Steg ist weiter oben.Die Soldaten werden sicher nicht ueber den Steg gegangen sein, sonderndurchs Wasser.""Aber im Wasser verliert er die Spur!""Ja freilich, aber so ist's im Feld auch. Warte nur, sein Instinkt wirdihn schon treiben, die Spur auf dem andern Ufer zu suchen." Richtig, Leoverschwand ploetzlich in der Tiefe, tauchte am andern Ufer des Bacheswieder auf, schuettelte sich das Wasser vom Fell, suchte und verschwandim Wald. Sie gingen nun dem Bach entlang bis zum Steg und hinueber an denWaldessaum. Dort standen sie eine ganze Weile gespannt und lauschend.Ploetzlich raschelte es im Laub und Leo tauchte auf."Er bringt eine Muetze!" rief Gebhard und rannte in hellem Vergnuegen demwackeren Tier entgegen, das in gestrecktem Lauf daher gesaust kam unddie Soldatenmuetze zu den Fuessen seines Herrn ablegte. "Brav, Leo, brav,"lobte der Fuehrer und befestigte die Leine am Halsband. "Fuehre mich,Leo!" Der Hund zog an, ging voraus, die kleine Gesellschaft folgte inden Wald hinein, durch dick und duenn eine gute Strecke weit; dann gabder Hund Laut und blieb stehen. Moeglichst im Unterholz versteckt lag einSoldat ohne Muetze. Der Fuehrer sprach ruhig und freundlich den Soldatenan, waehrend er sich den Anschein gab, ihm aufzuhelfen. "Der Hund mussmerken, dass es gute Freunde sind, die wir aufsuchen," erklaerte er,streichelte bald den Hund, bald den Soldaten und fuehrte diesen am Armmit sich fort.Die Uebung wurde wiederholt, der neue Sanitaetshund bewaehrte sichglaenzend, er fand alle Versteckten.Im Abendschein kehrten die Soldaten in das Lazarett zurueck, der Fuehrerbegleitete Mutter und Sohn noch bis in die Stadt. Dann kam der Abschied."Reut dich's nicht?" fragte er und sah bedenklich nach dem kleinen Mann,der seinen Hund zum letztenmal streichelte. "Nein, es reut mich garnicht. Ich glaube auch, dass Leo jetzt versteht, warum ich ihn hergebe.Er weiss, dass er Verwundete suchen muss. Gelt Leo?" Das Tier wedelte; esverstand jedenfalls so viel, dass von ihm die Rede war. Nun wandte sichGebhard ab, gab dem Fuehrer rasch die Hand und bat die Mutter: "Wirwollen jetzt doch lieber gehen."Sie verstand ihn und machte den Abschied kurz: "Viel Glueck!" rief sie."Viel Dank," antwortete der Feldgraue, "komm Leo!" So trennten sie sich.Helene und Gebhard gingen Hand in Hand durch die Vorstadt. Die Strassenwaren ihnen fast unbekannt und dennoch vertraut was da vor sich ging. Inder Mitte der Strasse bewegte sich, von zwei bewaffneten Soldatenbegleitet, ein Trupp gefangener Franzosen. Sie zogen und schoben einenWagen voll Brot hinauf nach dem Gefangenenlager. Niemand kuemmerte sichviel um den gewohnten Anblick.--Ein paar Frauen kamen des Weges, jederhing ueber dem Arm ein Pack grauer Kleidungsstuecke; man wusste: das sindFrauen, deren Maenner im Krieg sind und die nun naehen fuer das Militaer, umGeld zu verdienen fuer sich und die Kinder.--An einem Ladenfenster klebtein Blatt Papier, die neuesten amtlichen Berichte. Eine kleine Gruppesteht davor, auch Helene und Gebhard bemuehen sich, sie zu lesen, koennenaber nicht recht bei. "Nichts besonderes," sagt einer zum andern, "eshandelt sich halt wieder um Arras und Ypern."--Zwei voruebergehendeFrauen plaudern miteinander, man hoert nur drei Worte, nur dengewichtigen Ausruf: "das Stueck 14 Pfennig!" aber man weiss: von den Eiernreden sie.--Auch was die zwei aelteren Damen meinen, die so besorgtaussehen, ergaenzt sich ein Jeder, wenn er gleich nur hoert: "Morgensind's schon drei Wochen!" dass keine Nachricht vom Sohn mehreingetroffen ist.--Ein paar muntere Maedchen eilen vorueber, die eineruehmt sich: "O wir haben im vorigen Monat _zehn_ uebrig behalten,"Brotkarten natuerlich.Und ploetzlich schauen alle, horchen alle--drei Schuesse? Ein Sieg? Da unddort faehrt ein Fenster auf, Leute rufen auf die Strasse: Was ist's denn?Und von irgend woher kommt die Antwort und pflanzt sich fort: "Przemyslist gefallen!"_Eine_ Freude fliegt durch die ganze Stadt.Unsere beiden, Mutter und Sohn, eilen, koennen kaum erwarten heim zukommen; und wie sie das Haus erreichen, fangen gerade die Glocken an zulaeuten, die Fahnen kommen heraus und hoch oben an der Grossmutter Fenstererscheint neben der deutschen zum erstenmal auch die schwarz-gelbeoesterreichische; denn _eine_ kann nimmer genuegen, um die Siegesfreudeauszusprechen in dieser einzig grossen, schweren Zeit.Monate lang hatte Helene mit all ihren Gedanken in der Vergangenheitgelebt. Immer wieder hatte sie zurueckdenken muessen an den Tag, der ihrGlueck vernichtet hatte. Jetzt aber, durch den Brief ihres Mannes tatsich wieder eine Zukunft vor ihr auf und all ihr Sinnen ging dahin, wiees werden sollte, wenn er zurueckkaeme. Seine Stelle konnte er ja nichtmehr ausfuellen, das Forsthaus war keine Heimat mehr fuer sie. Vorlaengerer Zeit schon hatte die Mutter eine Anfrage eingesandt, um zuerfahren, ob die Wohnungseinrichtung im Forsthaus unbeschaedigt gebliebensei und geholt werden koennte. Heute war amtliche Mitteilung daruebereingetroffen. Sie besagte, dass infolge russischer Pluenderung saemtlicheMoebel und Hausgeraete zertruemmert seien, die Betten aufgeschnitten undbesudelt, Buecher und Schriftliches verbrannt. Wahrscheinlich sei diezerstoerte Wohnung spaeter noch durch Diebsgesindel durchsucht worden,denn es sei nicht das Geringste mehr vorhanden.Schmerzlich war diese Nachricht. Helene hatte als Braut eine reichekuenstlerische Ausstattung in das Forsthaus gebracht--nun war die ganzeschoene Einrichtung verloren. Und alles was Vater und Sohn besessen angeliebten Gegenstaenden, jedes Andenken an fruehere Zeiten, die Spiele,die Gebhards Kinderglueck ausgemacht hatten, alles war in die Haende roherGesellen gefallen und vernichtet worden.Helene war tief gebeugt ueber diese vollstaendige Verarmung. Noch vorkurzem haette sie sich wenig darum bekuemmert, aber eben jetzt, wo sieihren Mann erwartete, schmerzte es sie bitter. Nichts war mehr da vonihrem Hausstand, sie konnte nicht, wie andere Frauen, den Heimkehrendenim eigenen Haus empfangen. Aber das wusste sie: die Mutter wuerde Raumschaffen fuer ihren geliebten Sohn; an seine Mutter hatte er sich jagewandt, nicht an sie; das konnte sie begreifen: die Mutter verstand ihndoch am besten, sie allein hatte auch nie an seiner Ehre gezweifelt; zuihr kaeme er gerne und man musste dankbar sein, dass das moeglich war.So ging sie zur Mutter und fragte bescheiden: "Wie soll es werden, wennRudolf aus dem Lazarett kommt? Ich weiss, du wirst ihn mit Freudenaufnehmen, aber wenn ich mit den Kindern auch dabei bin, wird es dirdann nicht zu viel?""Freilich wird es mir zu viel," war die Antwort."Wie meinst du das, Mutter?" fragte Helene erschrocken.--"Ich meine zuviel fuer mich, weil zu wenig bleibt fuer dich. Ich habe schon vieldarueber nachgedacht und moechte gerne herausbringen, dass Ihr eine kleine,einfache Wohnung fuer Euch allein nehmen und einrichten koennt. Aber dasgenuegt Euch jungen Frauen nicht. Da soll immer alles zusammenpassend undstilgemaess sein. Dazu reicht es aber nicht. Es muesste eine ganzbescheidene 3 Zimmer-Wohnung sein und auch alte Moebel dazu verwendetwerden, das koennten wir mit vereinten Kraeften schon bestreiten und dannwaeret Ihr vier beisammen; so kaeme es mir am besten vor.""Und mir!" rief die junge Frau, und in aufwallendem Glueck umarmte siedie Mutter und rief in uebermuetiger Freude: "Ohne jeglichen Stil sollunser Heim werden, das verspreche ich dir, Mutter, so unkuenstlerisch alsdu nur willst. Ein urgemuetliches Nestchen wird's dennoch! O Mutter,gehen wir gleich Wohnungen ansehen?" Die Mutter sah gluecklich auf diestrahlende Freude, die der jungen Frau aus den Augen leuchtete. Und siedachte an ihren Sohn. Der beste Schatz war ihm doch geblieben.In den naechsten Tagen kamen noch von zwei Seiten Briefe, die auf diesenZukunftsplan Einfluss hatten. Der erste war von Helenens Bruder. Ersprach herzliche Teilnahme aus ueber das Schicksal des Erblindeten; aberauch Stolz und Freude ueber das Eiserne Kreuz, das der ganzen Familie zurEhre gereiche. Er bat die Schwester, mithelfen zu duerfen bei derGruendung eines neuen Heims.Der zweite Brief enthielt ein amtliches Schreiben und besagte, dass dankder grossen Summen, die aus ganz Deutschland fuer die vertriebenenOstpreussen eingegangen seien, eine Entschaedigung fuer den verlorenenBesitz bewilligt werden koennte, sobald der Antrag gestellt wuerde.Zu Traenen geruehrt war Helene ueber diese freiwillige Hilfe von allenSeiten. Jetzt hatte es keine Not mehr, sie konnte sich alles wieder soschoen und reichlich anschaffen, wie einst als Braut.Aber es ging ihr sonderbar: der Gedanke, hinzugehen, einzukaufen undsich nur zu fragen: Herz, was begehrst du? freute sie nicht mehr. In derKriegszeit, wo so viel bittere Not herrschte, sollte sie sich alleWuensche befriedigen? Sie war so froehlich und eifrig gewesen bei demGedanken, alles so schlicht und bescheiden wie moeglich einzurichten.Eine Weile sann sie nach, dann kam sie zur Mutter. "Du hast dochausgerechnet, dass wir reichen, wenn wir uns sparsam einrichten. Dannmoechte ich lieber nichts annehmen von der Summe, die fuer dieVertriebenen bestimmt ist. Es geht sonst an aermeren ab. Ich meine,Rudolf wird es auch so auffassen. Was denkst du, Mutter?""Ich denke, dass du das Herz am rechten Fleck hast," war die Antwort.Dieses gute Wort versetzte Helene in eine gehobene Stimmung, die ihrauch blieb, waehrend sie die bescheidene Wohnung waehlte und mitschlichten Moebeln ausstattete. Ein froehliches Vorbereiten, einbraeutliches Erwarten erfuellte sie in diesen Tagen.Elftes Kapitel.An seinen Schulheften sass Gebhard und seufzte. Ihm wurde das Warten aufden Vater unertraeglich lang. Die Mutter hatte es gut--ihre Tage warenganz ausgefuellt durch Vorbereitungen auf des Vaters Kommen; sie richtetedie Wohnung fuer ihn; sie ging um seinetwillen fast taeglich ins Lazarettzu den Augenleidenden und Blinden und half bei ihrer Pflege.Und die Grossmutter war von frueh bis spaet in allerlei Kriegshilfe taetig;viele arme Frauen kamen zu ihr und sie verschaffte ihnen Arbeit, seltenhatte sie ein wenig Musse fuer ihren Enkel. Else und Grete waren in allenFreistunden unterwegs, sie sammelten fuers Vaterland das Gold ein, vondem noch viel bei aengstlichen und bei gedankenlosen Menschen steckte.Das Schwesterchen spielte freilich gern mit dem Bruder, aber mehr als"Kuckuck" liess sich noch nicht mit ihr machen. Der bessere Spielkameradwar doch Leo gewesen und der fehlte jetzt.Einmal, als die Mutter vom Lazarett heimkam, klagte er ihr: "Es dauertso lang, so furchtbar lang, bis der Vater kommt!" Sie troestete ihn."Jetzt wird er sicherlich bald kommen. Warte nur ein Weilchen, dann wirdes um so schoener bei uns." Vom naechsten Ausgang brachte sie ihm ein Buchmit, dass ihm die Zeit rascher vergehe ueber dem Lesen.Aber das Buch war bald zu Ende. Er kam zur Grossmutter. "Wann kommt dennendlich der Vater, ich kann es nicht mehr erwarten!""So, du kannst nicht warten? Wir daheim und unsere Soldaten draussenmuessen doch alle warten!""Ja, aber es ist keine schoene Zeit, wenn man so wartet, Grossmutter.""Willst du denn eine schoene Zeit haben im Krieg, waehrend so vieleleiden? Sei froh, dass du auch etwas leiden darfst, wenn es auch nur eineschwere Geduldsprobe ist. Es kann noch lange dauern, bis der Vaterkommt; ich will sehen, ob du die Probe bestehst, ob du geduldigausharrst."So ernst nahm es die Grossmutter? Ja, wenn das eine schwere Probe war,wie sie die Soldaten zu bestehen haben, dann wollte er sie schon aufsich nehmen, das sollte die Grossmutter sehen. Er nahm sich zusammen undward wieder guten Mutes. Die Schule, die Kameradschaft waren ihm dabeidie beste Hilfe. Es war ihm wohl in seiner Klasse. "Sie sind alle nettgegen mich," erzaehlte er daheim, "und das kommt, weil sie meinen Leogern gehabt haben und weil sie vom Vater wissen." Er hatte recht. Durchden treuen Hund und durch das Schicksal des Vaters war dieAufmerksamkeit auf ihn gelenkt worden. Aber dass ihm alle Herzen zugetanwaren, das kam von seiner eigenen, tapferen, treuen Art; die zog dieandern an, ohne dass er's wusste.Eines Morgens, als Gebhard in die Schule kam, zog ihn ein Kameradbeiseite, tat geheimnisvoll, wollte ihm etwas sagen, das er docheigentlich verschweigen sollte. Endlich vertraute er, dessen BruderSanitaeter war, Gebhard an, dass an diesem Vormittag ein Zug mitVerwundeten ankaeme, er solle es eigentlich niemand sagen, damit nichtdie neugierigen Menschen an die Bahn kaemen. Sie wuerden alle in dasLazarett gebracht, ausser einem, den muesse sein Bruder abholen und in dieAugenklinik fahren, der habe beide Augen verloren. Ob das nicht GebhardsVater sein koenne?"Freilich kann er's sein!" rief Gebhard fast erschrocken durch dieploetzliche Hoffnung auf das Wiedersehen. "Um wieviel Uhr? Wann kommt derZug?""Das weiss man nicht so genau und es hilft dir ja auch nichts, wir habendoch bis zwoelf Uhr Schule. Aber es kann auch ein Uhr werden, bis der Zugkommt."Ruhig auf der Schulbank sitzen und denken, dass vielleicht der Vaterankomme? das ging doch nicht? Aber es _musste_ gehen. Die Grossmutterwuerde sagen: ausharren. Wie sonderbar, dass er da sass in dem grossenAugenblick, auf den er so lange gewartet hatte! Aber vielleicht kam derVater gar nicht. Wenn man es doch nur wuesste! Wie qualvoll diesesStillehalten!--Es war eben Krieg, und darum war alles schwer, sofurchtbar schwer!Der Unterricht hatte begonnen. Jetzt kam der Lehrer in seine Naehe undrichtete eine Frage an ihn. Gebhard stand langsam auf und atmete tief,wie wenn er eine Last mit in die Hoehe zu heben haette. Der Lehrer lachte."Nun, ist das eine so schwere Frage? Du seufzst ja ordentlich!" Ausgepresstem Herzen kam die Antwort: "Weil vielleicht gerade mein Vaterankommt und ich in der Schule bin!""Dein Vater kommt? Heute frueh? Du haettest ihn gern begruesst? Ja! Moechtestfort und fragst gar nicht? Ist's noch Zeit?"Gebhard konnte kaum antworten vor Erregung."Naerrischer Bub! So etwas erlaube ich doch! Spring davon!"Jetzt kam Leben in den kleinen Mann. Er fuhr von seinem Platz auf, derTuere zu."Deine Muetze!" riefen einige und lachten. Er wandte sich noch einmal,sie sahen jetzt alle sein strahlendes Gesicht. Die Muetze vom Nagel, aufund davon, dem Bahnhof zu.Unterwegs schlug es neun Uhr, drei Stunden konnte er, wenn noetig, vordem Bahnhof warten, ohne dass er daheim vermisst wurde. So lange wollte erausharren, o leicht und gern!Auf dem Bahnhofplatz war nicht wie sonst vor der Ankunft vonLazarettzuegen ein Menschenauflauf. Auch fuhren keine Rotkreuzwagen vor.Ein einziger stand leer und verlassen vor der Halle. Wenn nur auch derSchulkamerad recht hatte. Vielleicht war es eine falsche Nachricht. Ersah sich um. Sein Blick fiel auf zwei Weiber, mit Koerben am Arm, die dastanden und sich unterhielten. Er redete sie an, ob wohl bald dieVerwundeten ankaemen. Die eine lachte: "Da bist du zu spaet aufgestanden!"und da Gebhard nicht verstand, was sie meinte, erklaerte die andere: "Diesind schon vor einer halben Stunde gekommen und alle schonheimgefahren, bis auf das eine Auto, das bleibt wohl leer. Man schicktimmer lieber eins zu viel als zu wenig." Die Frauen wandten sich undgingen ihres Weges.Also zu spaet, nicht zu frueh! Bitter enttaeuscht stand Gebhard, konntesich nicht gleich entschliessen den Platz zu verlassen; zoegernd, planlosging er noch auf den Bahnhof zu und stand ploetzlich betroffen still. Ausdem Bahnhofgebaeude kam ein Sanitaeter, fuehrte zwei Maenner und diesebeiden hatten Binden um die Augen. Hoch klopfte Gebhards Herz. Er konntenoch nicht recht unterscheiden, aber jetzt naeherte sich die Gruppe; derSanitaeter stuetzte den einen der beiden, der ein junger feldgrauer Soldatwar und auch am Fuss verletzt schien; sorglich fuehrte er ihn die breitenStaffeln herunter auf die Stelle zu, wo das Auto stand. Inzwischen bliebder andere, den Fuehrer erwartend, an einer Saeule der Vorhalle stehen,und da nun seine stattliche, kraeftige Gestalt ganz zu sehen war,erkannte Gebhard seinen Vater. Alles Zoegern war vorbei, in jubelnderFreude sprang er herzu, die Staffeln hinauf und rief mit frohlockenderStimme:"Vater! Gruess dich Gott, lieber, guter Vater!" An dem ersten, trauten Rufhatte Stegemann sein Kind erkannt und nun griff er nach ihm mit beidenHaenden und zog ihn in warmer Liebe an sein Herz. "Gruess dich Gott, meinMaennlein, mein guter Bub! Ich haette nicht gedacht, dass du mich gleicherkennst und dich so freust an deinem blinden Vater!""O, ich habe es gar nicht mehr erwarten koennen, bis du kommst; daswissen wir ja schon lang, dass du blind bist, das macht _gar_ nichts,Vater!""So, das macht gar nichts?" wiederholte Stegemann und lachte von Herzen.Der Sanitaeter kam nun zurueck, um seinen zweiten Pflegbefohlenen zuholen."Kannst du denn nicht gleich zu uns, Vater? Ich kann dich so gutfuehren!""Zunaechst bin ich noch ins Lazarett ueberschrieben, aber bald darf ichheim, vielleicht schon morgen, der Arzt wird das bestimmen.""Willst du mitfahren und sehen, wohin dein Vater kommt?" fragte derSanitaeter und fuegte hinzu: "Wer hat dir denn verraten, dass heuteVerwundete ankommen?""Ein Schulkamerad.""Aha, ich kann mir schon denken, welcher das war. Macht nichts, komm nurmit!"Sorgsam fuehrte der Sanitaeter den Blinden die Staffeln hinunter. Gebhardging auf der andern Seite."Kuenftig darf ich dich immer fuehren, gelt Vater?""Letzte Stufe," sagte der Fuehrer und wandte sich an Gebhard: "Immervoraus sagen, sonst tut der Schritt weh; alles vorher ankuendigen, dasist die Hauptregel, dann gewinnen die Blinden Vertrauen und gehen ruhigund zuversichtlich. Darauf musst du achten!""Ja das will ich gewiss tun," versicherte Gebhard eifrig, "dann vertraustdu mir, gelt Vater?" Achtsam sah er zu, wie der Sanitaeter dem Blindendas Einsteigen ermoeglichte, mehr durch kurze Zurufe als durch Hilfe.Bald sassen sie nebeneinander, Hand in Hand und sprachen gar nicht viel,weil sie noch kaum das Glueck fassen konnten, wieder beisammen zu sein.Gebhard begleitete den Vater noch in den Saal. Die Neuangekommenensollten sich nach der langen Reise legen und ausruhen. Vater und Sohnmussten sich trennen. "Bitte die Grossmutter, sie moechte zuerst allein zumir kommen; fuer die Mutter ist's ein schwerer Gang!" sagte der Blinde,kuesste den Knaben und gab ihm leise den Auftrag: "Den Kuss gib derMutter!"Gebhard ging heim wie im Traum. Mit all seinen Gedanken, mit dem ganzenHerzen war er noch bei dem geliebten Vater, konnte selbst kaum an diewunderbare Maer glauben, die er nun verkuendigen wollte: dass der Vaterangekommen sei!Er traf aber zu Hause die nicht, die er suchte. Die beiden Frauen warennach der kuenftigen kleinen Wohnung hinuebergegangen; Helene war fertigmit der Einrichtung, hatte die Mutter geholt, um ihr alles zu zeigen undfuehrte sie jetzt durch die Zimmer. "Wie gefaellt es dir, Mutter? Istdir's recht so?""Mir freilich, du hast ja alles mehr nach meinem als nach deinem Sinneingerichtet. Es ist wohl ein Unterschied gegen deine fruehere reiche,stilvolle Einrichtung!" Sie sah die Schwiegertochter an, wie wenn sieerforschen wollte, ob es ihr schwer ums Herz sei. Aber Helene lachtefroehlich: "Es ist doch alles wieder stilvoll, Mutter, es ist Kriegsstil.Wie wenn man Reste aus ein paar zerstoerten Haeusern zusammengetragenhaette: da ein paar schoene, alte Moebel von dir, dort schlichte, gebeiztevom Schreiner, da der hochfeine Schreibtisch, den mein Bruder geschickthat, und davor ein gewoehnlicher Holzstuhl. Und an der ausgebessertenTapete Bilder in schwarzen, braunen und vergoldeten Rahmen und gar einkleiner Spiegel vom Troedelmarkt. Aber sieh, die sogenannteMaedchenkammer, hat die nicht ein nettes Stuebchen fuer Gebhard gegeben?Seine Kriegsbilder hat er selbst an die Wand nageln duerfen und seinschmales Feldbett ist auch reinster Kriegsstil. Dazu passt auch statteines Maedchens die kleine Kriegswitwe, der du das Essen gibst; das allesstimmt herrlich zusammen. Nun fehlt nur _er_ noch! Wie lange wohl?"Draussen wurde geklopft. "Es muss jemand an der Vorplatztuere sein," sagteHelene, "die Klingel geht naemlich nicht immer und der Aufzug ist auchein wenig launisch, das macht aber nichts, gehoert eben auch zumKriegsstil."Sie gingen miteinander hinaus und oeffneten. Gebhard stand vor ihnen aufder Schwelle, wusste vor uebergrosser Erregung nicht gleich, wie ererzaehlen sollte, war auch so gesprungen, dass es ihm den Atem benommenhatte. Aber die Mutter fing seinen strahlenden Blick auf, ahnte undrief: "Der Vater kommt?""Der Vater ist schon da!" Glueckselig fiel er der Mutter um den Hals undjubelte: "Da bringe ich dir einen Kuss von ihm!"Zwoelftes Kapitel.Am Bett ihres Sohnes sass Frau Dr. Stegemann; die andern Betten standenleer, die Verwundeten waren an dem schoenen Nachmittag ins Freie gebrachtworden. So waren die Beiden allein in dieser ersten Stunde desWiedersehens und ungestoert hatte der Sohn seiner tapfern Mutter seineErlebnisse erzaehlen koennen. Sie wusste jetzt, was er durchgemacht von demAugenblick an, da er sich bereit erklaert, die Russen zu fuehren, in derstillen Absicht sie wegzubringen von seinen Lieben im Forsthaus und siein die Irre zu leiten, um die deutsche Patrouille zu retten. DerOffizier traute seinem Fuehrer nicht und bedrohte ihn, wenn er ihm nichtzu Willen sei, solle er nie mehr seine schoene Frau wiedersehen, er wuerdeihm die Augen ausstechen lassen.So wusste er, welch grausame Marter ihm bevorstand. Noch hoffte er aufirgend einen gluecklichen Zufall, der ihm zu Hilfe kaeme, und betete imstillen. Aber das Misstrauen der Feinde wuchs immer mehr, er erkannte,dass der bittere Kelch nicht an ihm voruebergehen sollte, und bereitetesich innerlich vor auf das, was kommen musste.Leute kamen des Weges, wurden ausgefragt und darnach wandte sich die Wutder Feinde gegen ihn. Sie veruebten an ihm die grauenvolle Untat, liessenihn in seinen Qualen liegen und ritten davon.Als Stegemann so weit erzaehlt hatte, spuerte er an der zitternden Handder Mutter, dass sie ueberwaeltigt war, und er hielt inne."Ist dir's so schwer, Mutter? Es ist ja ueberstanden, auch dieschrecklichen Qualen, die folgten. Aber ich will dir jetzt nicht weiterdavon erzaehlen; ich danke dir, dass du mich so tapfer angehoert hast. Dirhabe ich es zugetraut, darum wollte ich dich zuerst allein sprechen.Aber nun will ich vergessen, was dahinten ist, und jetzt sage du mir,Mutter, was liegt vor mir? Darf ich dies Elend meiner jungen Frauaufladen? Kann sie es tragen, sie, die so weich und feinfuehlend ist undmir immer erschien, als sei ihre Natur ganz auf Lust und Freudeangelegt? Zwar glaube ich nicht, dass wir Not leiden muessen. Das ganzeVaterland hilft uns Invaliden, hilft vor allem, dass wir arbeiten lernenund etwas verdienen koennen. Damit habe ich schon angefangen und werdemeine ganze Kraft einsetzen, um mitzusorgen fuer die Meinigen. Aberdennoch--wie schwer ist es fuer Helene! Nie haette ich, so wie ich jetztbin, ihr junges Leben mit dem meinigen verbunden!" Er setzte sich auf inseinem Bett und horchte gespannt zur Mutter hin. Die nahm seine Hand indie ihrige und sprach in voller Ueberzeugung: "Da sei du ganz unbesorgt,Rudolf, keine Braut kann verlangender dem jungen Braeutigamentgegensehen, als sie ihrem Helden!""Weil sie nicht weiss, was fuer ein Anblick ihr bevorsteht und was esheisst, einen hilfsbeduerftigen Blinden um sich zu haben, anstatt einesritterlichen Gatten, der ihr alle Schwierigkeiten des Lebens aus dem Wegraeumt!""O, sie weiss das besser als du denkst, Rudolf; wir haben neun MonateKrieg erlebt, die waren fuer deine Frau voll Angst und Reue, voll Sehnenund Warten; sie hat sich durchgekaempft, ist stark geworden, um Leid undEntbehrung mit dir zu tragen.""Mutter, damit nimmst du mir die schwerste Sorge ab! Wenn es so ist,dann, liebe Mutter, o dann bitte ich dich, gehe gleich zu ihr; ich habemich nach ihr gesehnt jede Stunde, seit wir getrennt sind; um keineweitere Stunde soll die Trennung verlaengert werden.""Ich gehe, Rudolf, sie wird bei dir sein schneller als du denkst. Ichbringe ihr deine Botschaft."Er richtete sich auf, tastete nach dem Tischchen nebenan, zog dieSchublade auf."Was suchst du? Kann ich dir helfen?""Ja, es wird eine Schachtel da sein, in der ist mein Eisernes Kreuz.Wenn du mir das befestigen willst. Dass sie doch _etwas_ Schoenes sieht anihrem Mann!--So, nun ist's gut. Und die Augen sind bedeckt, nicht wahr,man sieht die Zerstoerung nicht?""Nein."--Sie wollte hinzufuegen: "Deine Frau hat sich laengst geuebt, auchdas zu sehen," aber sie unterdrueckte es. Wer konnte wissen, wie es sieim Antlitz des eigenen geliebten Mannes erschuettern wuerde?Unten im Garten wurde Frau Stegemann von Helene sehnlich erwartet."Mutter, wie geht es ihm? Sage mir, warum wollte er dich alleinsprechen?""Er hat Mitleid mit dir, dass du ihn so wiedersehen musst, hat Angst, esmoechte dir zu schrecklich sein. Es ist auch schwer, Helene, mich hat esfurchtbar erschuettert; ich musste mich _so_ zusammennehmen, um dieFassung zu bewahren."Jetzt, da der Sohn nicht mehr darunter leiden konnte, jetzt verlor siediese Fassung und konnte die bittern Traenen nicht zurueckhalten. Dashatte Helene noch nie erlebt; immer war die Mutter ihr an Seelenstaerkeueberlegen gewesen. Sie hatte tiefes Mitleid mit der Mutter, die ihr inihrem Kummer zum erstenmal als eine alte Frau erschien. "Es hat dichangegriffen," sagte sie herzlich zu ihr, "soll ich dich heimbegleiten?"Aber Frau Stegemann wehrte ab. "Nein, nein, ich finde mich schon wiederzurecht. Geh nur, Kind; halte dich nicht mit mir auf, geh zu ihm, erwartet!"Der Mutter Schwaeche wurde eine merkwuerdige Hilfe fuer die junge Frau.Wenn die Mutter, die starke, versagte, dann musste sie die tapfere sein.Alles Bangen wich von ihr, leichtfuessig eilte sie die Treppe hinauf, siewollte nichts aufkommen lassen als reinste Wiedersehensfreude in dieserlang ersehnten Stunde.Sie oeffnete die Tuere, sah, wie bei dem Geraeusch ein Kopf sich aus demKissen hob, eine Gestalt sich halb aufrichtete und nach der Tuere wandte."Rudolf, ich bin's!" rief sie, war im Augenblick bei ihm, umarmte ihnstuermisch und rief ihm froehlich zu: "Glaubst du, dass ich's bin, wenn dumich gleich nicht siehst?"Er spuerte ihre Froehlichkeit und zog sie an sein Herz."Ja, du bist's Helene, du Sonne in meiner Nacht! Gott sei Dank, dass ichdich habe!" Er kuesste sie. Da schob sie sanft die Binde ueber seine Stirnehinweg, drueckte einen Kuss auf jede der verheilten Wunden und sagte zuihm: "Das sind deine Ehrenzeichen, du mein Held. Wie bin ich stolz aufdiese Narben!"Er legte sich zurueck, fuehlte sich aller Angst und Sorge ledig und gabsich der Wonne des wiedergefundenen Glueckes hin.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ohne den Vater, by Agnes Sapper*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OHNE DEN VATER ******** This file should be named 11677.txt or 11677.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/6/7/11677/Produced by Charles Franks and the DP TeamUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year. For example:     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  Forexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234or filename 24689 would be found at:     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689An alternative method of locating eBooks:     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALLThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Voyage to the South Sea, by William BlighThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and withalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

This method I have since been induced toalter. The reason of the Narrative appearing first was for the purpose ofcommunicating early information concerning an event which had attractedthe public notice: and, being drawn up in a hasty manner, it requiredmany corrections. Some circumstances likewise were omitted; and thenotation of time used in the Narrative being according to sea reckoning,in which the days begin and end at noon, must have produced a degree ofobscurity and confusion to readers accustomed only to the civil mode. Andthis would have increased as the remainder of the voyage, on account ofthe numerous shore occurrences at Otaheite and elsewhere, could not, withclearness and propriety, have been related in any other than the usualmanner of reckoning.Besides remedying these inconveniencies I have thought a fuller accountof our passage from Timor to Europe than that contained in the Narrativewould not be unacceptable. These reasons, with the manifest convenienceof comprising the whole Voyage in one continued narrative, in preferenceto letting it appear in disjointed accounts will, it is hoped, be alloweda sufficient excuse for having varied from the original intention.Nevertheless for the accommodation of the purchasers of the Narrativealready published those who desire it will be supplied with the otherparts of the Voyage separate; i.e. the part previous to the mutiny andthe additional account after leaving Timor....CONTENTS.CHAPTER 1.Plan of the Expedition.Outfit and Occurrences to the time of leaving England.Description of the Breadfruit.CHAPTER 2.Departure from England.Arrival at Tenerife.Sail from thence.Arrival off Cape Horn.Severity of the Weather.Obliged to bear away for the Cape of Good Hope.CHAPTER 3.Passage towards the Cape of Good Hope and Search after Tristan da Cunha.Arrival at False Bay.Occurrences there.Reports concerning the Grosvenor's People.Departure from the Cape.CHAPTER 4.Passage towards Van Diemen's Land.Make the Island of St. Paul.Arrival in Adventure Bay.Natives seen.Sail from Van Diemen's Land.CHAPTER 5.Rocky Islands discovered.See the Island Maitea and arrive at Otaheite.Ship crowded by the Natives.CHAPTER 6.Account of an English Ship lately sailed from Otaheite.Death of Omai.Captain Cook's Picture sent on board.Otoo visits the Ship.His Visit returned.Natives well disposed towards us.Account of the Cattle left by Captain Cook.Breadfruit plants promised.Visit to the Earee Rahie.Presents made to the Arreoys.CHAPTER 7.A theft committed.Deception of the painted Head.Conversation with a Priest.A Wrestling Match.Reports of the Natives concerning other Islands.Some Account of Omai.CHAPTER 8.Expedition to Tettaba after a Heifer.Extraordinary domestic Arrangements.Tinah's Mother visits the Ship.A Sheep brought from Ulietea.Heavy Storm.Death of the Surgeon.Taowne and Toahroah Harbours examined.CHAPTER 9.A Walk into the Country.The Peeah Roah.Prevailed on by the Kindness of the Chiefs to defer our Departure.Breadfruit Plants collected.Move the Ship to Toahroah Harbour.Fishing.Three of the Ship's Company desert.Indiscretion of our People on Shore.Instances of Jealousy.Mourning.Bull brought to Oparre by a Prophet.The Deserters recovered.Tinah proposes to visit England.CHAPTER 10.The Ship's Cable cut in the Night.Coolness with the Chiefs on that Account.Visit to an old Lady.Disturbance at a Heiva.Tinah's Hospitality.A Thief taken and punished.Preparations for sailing.CHAPTER 11.Arrival of an Arreoy Woman from Tethuroa.A Present delivered by Tinah for his Majesty.Other Occurrences to the Time of the Ship's Departure from Otaheite.CHAPTER 12.At the Island Huaheine.A Friend of Omai visits the Ship.Leave the Society Islands.A Water-spout.The Island Whytootackee discovered.Anchor in Annamooka Road.Our Parties on Shore robbed by the Natives.Sail from Annamooka.The Chiefs detained on board.Part friendly.CHAPTER 13.A Mutiny in the Ship.CHAPTER 14.Proceed in the Launch to the Island Tofoa.Difficulty in obtaining Supplies there.Treacherous Attack of the Natives.Escape to Sea and bear away for New Holland.CHAPTER 15.Passage towards New Holland.Islands discovered in our Route.Our great Distresses.See the Reefs of New Holland and find a Passage through them.CHAPTER 16.Progress to the Northward along the Coast of New Holland.Land on different Islands in search of Supplies.CHAPTER 17.Passage from New Holland to the Island Timor.Arrive at Coupang.Reception there.CHAPTER 18.At Coupang.CHAPTER 19.From Timor to Batavia.CHAPTER 20.Occurrences at Batavia and Passage thence to England....(LIST OF THE PLATES.Head of Lieutenant Bligh.Plan and profile of the deck of the Bounty.Sections of the Breadfruit.Plan of Toahroah harbour.Copy of the draught from which the Bounty's launch was built.Chart of Islands discovered from the launch.Chart of part of the north-east coast of New Holland.Chart of the track of the launch from Tofoa to Timor.)...A VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH SEAS, ETC.CHAPTER 1.Plan of the Expedition.Outfit and Occurrences to the time of leaving England.Description of the Breadfruit.1787.The King having been graciously pleased to comply with a request from themerchants and planters interested in his Majesty's West India possessionsthat the breadfruit tree might be introduced into those islands, a vesselproper for the undertaking was bought and taken into dock at Deptford tobe provided with the necessary fixtures and preparations for executingthe object of the voyage. These were completed according to a plan of mymuch honoured friend, Sir Joseph Banks, which in the event proved themost advantageous that could have been adopted for the intended purpose.August 16.The ship was named the Bounty: I was appointed to command her on the 16thof August 1787. Her burthen was nearly two hundred and fifteen tons; herextreme length on deck ninety feet ten inches; extreme breadthtwenty-four feet three inches; and height in the hold under the beams atthe main hatchway ten feet three inches. In the cockpit were the cabinsof the surgeon, gunner, botanist, and clerk, with a steward-room andstorerooms. The between decks was divided in the following manner: thegreat cabin was appropriated for the preservation of the plants andextended as far forward as the after hatchway. It had two largeskylights, and on each side three scuttles for air, and was fitted with afalse floor cut full of holes to contain the garden-pots in which theplants were to be brought home. The deck was covered with lead, and atthe foremost corners of the cabin were fixed pipes to carry off the waterthat drained from the plants into tubs placed below to save it for futureuse. I had a small cabin on one side to sleep in, adjoining to the greatcabin, and a place near the middle of the ship to eat in. The bulk-headof this apartment was at the after-part of the main hatchway, and on eachside of it were the berths of the mates and midshipmen; between theseberths the arm-chest was placed. The cabin of the master, in which wasalways kept the key of the arms, was opposite to mine. This particulardescription of the interior parts of the ship is rendered necessary bythe event of the expedition.The ship was masted according to the proportion of the navy; but on myapplication the masts were shortened, as I thought them too much for her,considering the nature of the voyage.September 3.On the 3rd of September the ship came out of dock; but the carpenters andjoiners remained on board much longer, as they had a great deal of workto finish.The next material alteration made in the fitting out was lessening thequantity of iron and other ballast. I gave directions that only nineteentons of iron should be taken on board instead of the customary proportionwhich was forty-five tons. The stores and provisions I judged would befully sufficient to answer the purpose of the remainder; for I am ofopinion that many of the misfortunes which attend ships in heavy stormsof wind are occasioned by too much dead weight in their bottoms.The establishment of men and officers for the ship were as follows:1 Lieutenant to command.1 Master.1 Boatswain.1 Gunner.1 Carpenter.1 Surgeon.2 Master's Mates.2 Midshipmen.2 Quartermasters.1 Quartermaster's Mate.1 Boatswain's Mate.1 Gunner's Mate.1 Carpenter's Mate.1 Carpenter's Crew.1 Sailmaker.1 Armourer.1 Corporal.1 Clerk and Steward.23 Able Seamen.---44.Two skilful and careful men were appointed, at Sir Joseph Banks'srecommendation, to have the management of the plants intended to bebrought home: the one, David Nelson, who had been on similar employmentin Captain Cook's last voyage; the other, William Brown, as an assistantto him. With these two our whole number amounted to forty-six.It was proposed that our route to the Society Islands should be roundCape Horn; and the greatest dispatch became necessary as the season wasalready far advanced: but the shipwrights not being able to completetheir work by the time the ship was ready in other respects, our sailingwas unavoidably retarded.October. Thursday 4.However by the 4th of October the pilot came on board to take us down theriver.Tuesday 9.On the 9th we fell down to Long Reach where we received our gunner'sstores and guns, four four-pounders and ten swivels.The ship was stored and victualled for eighteen months. In addition tothe customary allowance of provisions we were supplied with sourkraut,portable soup, essence of malt, dried malt, and a proportion of barleyand wheat in lieu of oatmeal. I was likewise furnished with a quantity ofironwork and trinkets to serve in our intercourse with the natives in theSouth Seas: and from the board of Longitude I received a timekeeper, madeby Mr. Kendal.Monday 15.On the 15th I received orders to proceed to Spithead.November. Sunday 4.But the winds and weather were so unfavourable that we did not arrivethere till the 4th of November. On the 24th I received from Lord Hood,who commanded at Spithead, my final orders. The wind, which for severaldays before had been favourable, was now turned directly against us.Wednesday 28.On the 28th the ship's company received two months pay in advance, and onthe following morning we worked out to St. Helen's, where we were obligedto anchor.1787. December. Sunday 23.We made different unsuccessful attempts to get down Channel, but contrarywinds and bad weather constantly forced us back to St. Helen's, orSpithead, until Sunday the 23rd of December when we sailed with a fairwind.During our stay at Spithead, the rate of the timepiece was several timesexamined by Mr. Bailey's observations at the Portsmouth observatory. Onthe 19th of December, the last time of its being examined on shore, itwas 1 minute 52 seconds, 5 too fast for meantime, and then losing at therate of 1 second, 1 per day; and at this rate I estimate its going whenwe sailed.The object of all the former voyages to the South Seas undertaken by thecommand of his present majesty, has been the advancement of science andthe increase of knowledge. This voyage may be reckoned the first theintention of which has been to derive benefit from those distantdiscoveries. For the more fully comprehending the nature and plan of theexpedition, and that the reader may be possessed of every informationnecessary for entering on the following sheets, I shall here lay beforehim a copy of the instructions I received from the admiralty, andlikewise a short description of the breadfruit.BY THE COMMISSIONERS FOR EXECUTING THE OFFICE OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OFGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, ETC.Whereas the king, upon a representation from the merchants and plantersinterested in his Majesty's West India possessions that the introductionof the breadfruit tree into the islands of those seas, to constitute anarticle of food, would be of very essential benefit to the inhabitants,hath, in order to promote the interests of so respectable a body of hissubjects (especially in an instance which promises general advantage)thought fit that measures should be taken for the procuring some of thosetrees, and conveying them to the said West India islands: And whereas thevessel under your command hath, in consequence thereof, been stored andvictualled for that service, and fitted with proper conveniences andnecessaries for the preservation of as many of the said trees as, fromher size, can be taken on board her; and you have been directed toreceive on board her the two gardeners named in the margin, David Nelson,and William Brown, who, from their knowledge of trees and plants, havebeen hired for the purpose of selecting such as shall appear to be of aproper species and size:You are, therefore, in pursuance of his majesty's pleasure, signified tous by Lord Sydney, one of his principal secretaries of state, herebyrequired and directed to put to sea in the vessel you command, the firstfavourable opportunity of wind and weather, and proceed with her, asexpeditiously as possible, round Cape Horn, to the Society Islands,situate in the Southern ocean, in the latitude of about eighteen degreessouth, and longitude of about two hundred and ten degrees east fromGreenwich, where, according to the accounts given by the late CaptainCook, and persons who accompanied him during his voyages, the breadfruittree is to be found in the most luxuriant state.Having arrived at the above-mentioned islands, and taken on board as manytrees and plants as may be thought necessary (the better to enable you todo which, you have already been furnished with such articles ofmerchandise and trinkets as it is supposed will be wanted to satisfy thenatives) you are to proceed from thence through Endeavour Straits (whichseparate New Holland from New Guinea) to Prince's Island in the Straitsof Sunda, or, if it should happen to be more convenient, to pass on theeastern side of Java to some port on the north side of that island, whereany breadfruit trees which may have been injured, or have died, may bereplaced by mangosteens, duriens, jacks, nancas, lanfas, and other finefruit trees of that quarter, as well as the rice plant which grows upondry land; all of which species (or such of them as shall be judged mosteligible) you are to purchase on the best terms you can from theinhabitants of that island with the ducats with which you have also beenfurnished for that purpose; taking care however, if the rice plantsabove-mentioned cannot be procured at Java, to touch at Prince's Islandfor them, where they are regularly cultivated.From Prince's Island, or the Island of Java, you are to proceed round theCape of Good Hope to the West Indies (calling on your way thither at anyplaces which may be thought necessary) and deposit one half of such ofthe above-mentioned trees and plants as may be then alive at hismajesty's botanical garden at St. Vincent, for the benefit of theWindward Islands, and then go on to Jamaica: and, having delivered theremainder to Mr. East, or such person or persons as may be authorised bythe governor and council of that island to receive them, refreshed yourpeople, and received on board such provisions and stores as may benecessary for the voyage, make the best of your way back to England;repairing to Spithead, and sending to our secretary an account of yourarrival and proceedings.And whereas you will receive herewith a copy of the instructions whichhave been given to the above-mentioned gardeners for their guidance, aswell as in procuring the said trees and plants, and the management ofthem after they shall be put on board, as for bringing to England a smallsample of each species, and such others as may be prepared by thesuperintendent of the botanical garden at St. Vincent's, and by the saidMr. East, or others, for his majesty's garden at Kew; you are herebyrequired and directed to afford, and to give directions to your officersand company to afford, the said gardeners every possible aid andassistance, not only in the collecting of the said trees and plants atthe places before mentioned, but for their preservation during theirconveyance to the places of their destination.Given under our hands the 20th November 1787.HOWE,CHARLES BRETT,RD. HOPKINS,J. LEVESON GOWER.To Lieutenant William Bligh, commanding his majesty's armed vessel theBounty at Spithead.By command of their Lordships,P. STEPHENS....In the foregoing orders it is to be observed that I was particularlydirected to proceed round Cape Horn but, as the season was so faradvanced and we were so long detained by contrary winds, I madeapplication to the Admiralty for discretional orders on that point; towhich I received the following answer:BY THE COMMISSIONERS FOR EXECUTING THE OFFICE OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OFGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, ETC. ETC.The season of the year being now so far advanced as to render it probablethat your arrival with the vessel you command on the southern coast ofAmerica will be too late for your passing round Cape Horn without muchdifficulty and hazard, you are in that case at liberty (notwithstandingformer orders) to proceed in her to Otaheite, round the Cape of GoodHope.Given under our hands the 18th December 1787.HOWE,CHARLES BRETT,BAYHAM.To Lieutenant William Bligh, commanding His Majesty's armed vesselBounty, Spithead.By command of their Lordships,P. Stephens....The Breadfruit is so well known and described that to attempt a newaccount of it would be unnecessary and useless. However as it maycontribute to the convenience of the reader I have given the followingextracts respecting it with the plate annexed.EXTRACT FROM THE ACCOUNT OF DAMPIER'S VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD PERFORMED IN1688.The breadfruit (as we call it) grows on a large tree, as big and high asour largest apple-trees: It hath a spreading head, full of branches anddark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like apples; it is as big as apenny-loaf when wheat is at five shillings the bushel; it is of a roundshape, and hath a thick tough rind. When the fruit is ripe it is yellowand soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant. The natives of Guam use itfor bread. They gather it, when full-grown, while it is green and hard;then they bake it in an oven, which scorches the rind and makes it black;but they scrape off the outside black crust, and there remains a tenderthin crust; and the inside is soft, tender, and white like the crumb of apenny-loaf. There is NEITHER SEED NOR STONE in the inside, but all is ofa pure substance, like bread. It must be eaten new; for, if it is keptabove twenty-four hours, it grows harsh and choaky; but it is verypleasant before it is too stale. This fruit lasts in season EIGHT MONTHSin the year, during which the natives eat NO OTHER SORT OF FOOD OF BREADKIND. I did never see of this fruit anywhere but here. The natives toldus that there is plenty of this fruit growing on the rest of the Ladroneislands; and I DID NEVER HEAR OF IT ANYWHERE ELSE. Volume 1 page 296....EXTRACT FROM THE ACCOUNT OF LORD ANSON'S VOYAGE, PUBLISHED BY MR. WALTER.There was at Tinian a kind of fruit, peculiar to these (Ladrone) islands,called by the Indians rhymay, but by us the breadfruit; for it wasconstantly eaten by us, during our stay upon the island, * instead ofbread; and so UNIVERSALLY PREFERRED that no ship's bread was expended inthat whole interval. It grew upon a tree which is somewhat lofty, andwhich towards the top divides into large and spreading branches. Theleaves of this tree are of a remarkable deep green, are notched about theedges, and are generally from a foot to eighteen inches in length. Thefruit itself is found indifferently on all parts of the branches; it isin shape rather elliptical than round; it is covered with a tough rindand is usually seven or eight inches long; each of them grows singly andnot in clusters. This fruit is fittest to be used when it is full-grownbut still green; in which state, after it is properly prepared by beingroasted in the embers, its taste has some distant resemblance to that ofan artichoke's bottom, and its texture is not very different, for it issoft and spongy.(*Footnote. About two months, namely from the latter end of August to thelatter end of October, 1742.)...EXTRACTS FROM THE ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN COOK.HAWKESWORTH, VOLUME 2.IN THE SOCIETY ISLANDS.The breadfruit grows on a tree that is about the size of a middling oak;its leaves are frequently a foot and a half long, of an oblong shape,deeply sinuated like those of the fig-tree, which they resemble inconsistence and colour, and in the exuding of a white milky juice uponbeing broken. The fruit is about the size and shape of a child's head,and the surface is reticulated not much unlike a truffle: it is coveredwith a thin skin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a smallknife. The eatable part lies between the skin and the core; it is aswhite as snow, and somewhat of the consistence of new bread: it must beroasted before it is eaten, being first divided into three or four parts.Its taste is insipid, with a slight sweetness somewhat resembling that ofthe crumb of wheaten bread mixed with a Jerusalem artichoke.Pages 80, 81. See also the plate there and at page 232.Of the many vegetables that have been mentioned already as serving themfor food, the principal is the breadfruit, to procure which costs them notrouble or labour but climbing a tree. The tree which produces it doesnot indeed shoot up spontaneously, but if a man plants ten of them in hislifetime, which he may do in about an hour, he will as completely fulfilhis duty to his own and future generations as the native of our lesstemperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold winter, and reaping inthe summer's heat, as often as these seasons return; even if, after hehas procured bread for his present household, he should convert a surplusinto money, and lay it up for his children.It is true indeed that the breadfruit is not always in season; butcoconuts, bananas, plantains, and a great variety of other fruits supplythe deficiency. Page 197.EXTRACT FROM THE ACCOUNT OF CAPTAIN COOK'S LAST VOYAGE.IN THE SOCIETY ISLANDS.I (Captain Cook) have inquired very carefully into their manner ofcultivating the breadfruit tree at Otaheite; but was always answered thatthey never planted it. This indeed must be evident to everyone who willexamine the places where the young trees come up. It will be alwaysobserved that they spring from the roots of the old ones which run alongnear the surface of the ground. So that the breadfruit trees may bereckoned those that would naturally cover the plains, even supposing thatthe island was not inhabited, in the same manner that the white-barkedtrees, found at Van Diemen's Land, constitute the forests there. And fromthis we may observe that the inhabitant of Otaheite, instead of beingobliged to plant his bread, will RATHER be under the necessity ofpreventing its progress; which I suppose is sometimes done to give roomfor trees of another sort, to afford him some variety in his food. Volume2 page 145.IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.The breadfruit trees are planted, and flourish with great luxuriance, onrising grounds. Where the hills rise almost perpendicularly in a greatvariety of peaked forms, their steep sides and the deep chasms betweenthem are covered with trees, amongst which those of the breadfruit wereobserved particularly to abound. Volume 3 pages 105 and 114, containingCaptain King's Narrative.The climate of the Sandwich Islands differs very little from that of theWest India Islands, which lie IN THE SAME LATITUDE. Upon the wholeperhaps it may be rather more temperate. Captain King ib page 116.The breadfruit trees thrive in these islands, not in such abundance, butproduce double the quantity of fruit they do on the rich plains ofOtaheite. The trees are nearly of the same height, but the branches beginto strike out from the trunk much lower, and with greater luxuriance.Captain King ib page 120.CHAPTER 2.Departure from England.Arrival at Tenerife.Sail from thence.Arrival off Cape Horn.Severity of the Weather.Obliged to bear away for the Cape of Good Hope.1787. December. Sunday 23.On Sunday morning the 23rd of December 1787 we sailed from Spithead and,passing through the Needles, directed our course down channel with afresh gale of wind at east. In the afternoon one of the seamen, infurling the main-top-gallant-sail, fell off the yard and was so fortunateas to save himself by catching hold of the main-top-mast-stay in hisfall. At night the wind increased to a strong gale with a heavy sea.Tuesday 25.It moderated however on the 25th and allowed us to keep our Christmaswith cheerfulness; but the following day it blew a severe storm of windfrom the eastward, which continued till the 29th, in the course of whichwe suffered greatly. One sea broke away the spare yards and spars out ofthe starboard main chains. Another heavy sea broke into the ship andstove all the boats. Several casks of beer that had been lashed upon deckwere broke loose and washed overboard, and it was not without greatdifficulty and risk that we were able to secure the boats from beingwashed away entirely.Saturday 29.On the 29th we were in latitude 39 degrees 35 minutes north and longitude14 degrees 26 minutes west when the gale abated and the weather becamefair. Besides other mischief done to us by the storm, a large quantity ofour bread was damaged and rendered useless, for the sea had stove in ourstern and filled the cabin with water. From this time to our arrival atTenerife we had moderate weather and winds mostly from the northward.1788. January.January 4.This forenoon we spoke a French ship bound to the Mauritius.Saturday 5. Tenerife.The next day at nine in the forenoon we saw the island of Tenerifebearing west-south-west half west about twelve leagues distant. It wascovered with a thick haze except the north-westernmost part which is aremarkable headland, resembling a horse's head, the ears very distinct.To the eastward of this head* lie two round rocks, the northern boundaryof Tenerife. I had a good observation at noon by which I make thelatitude of the two rocks 28 degrees 44 minutes north and their longitudeby our timekeeper 16 degrees 5 minutes west. To the southward of theseand near the shore is a high needle rock: about four leagues farther tothe southward the coast inclines towards the west to the road of SantaCruz, where we anchored at half-past nine on Sunday morning intwenty-five fathoms water, and moored along shore in the same depth, withthe cupola tower of the church of St. Francis bearing west half north onemile, the east part of the road east by north, the castle on the southpoint south-west, and the west part of the Grand Canary south-south-east.A Spanish packet bound to Corunna, an American brig, and several othervessels, were lying here.(*Footnote. South 82 degrees east by the compass.)As soon as the ship was anchored I sent an officer (Mr. Christian) towait on the governor and to acquaint him I had put in to obtainrefreshments and to repair the damages we had sustained in bad weather.To this I had a very polite answer from the governor, * that I should besupplied with whatever the island afforded. I had also directed theofficer to acquaint him that I would salute, provided an equal number ofguns were to be returned but, as I received an extraordinary answer tothis part of my message, purporting that his excellency did not returnthe same number but to persons equal in rank to himself, this ceremonywas omitted.(*Footnote. Marquis de Brancheforte.)During this interval I was visited by the port-master (Captain Adams) andshortly afterwards several officers came on board from his excellency tocompliment me on my arrival. As soon as the ship was moored I went onshore and paid my respects to him.Monday 7.On Monday morning I began to forward the ship's business with the utmostdispatch, and gave the necessary directions to Messrs. Collogan and sons,the contractors, for the supplies I wanted. I also got leave of thegovernor for Mr. Nelson to range the hills and examine the country insearch of plants and natural curiosities.As there was a great surf on the shore I bargained for everything Iwanted to be brought off by the shore boats, and agreed to give fiveshillings per ton for water. Very good wine was bought at ten pounds perpipe, the contract price; but the superior quality was fifteen pounds;and some of this was not much inferior to the best London Madeira. Ifound this was an unfavourable season for other refreshments: Indiancorn, potatoes, pumpkins, and onions, were all very scarce and double theprice of what they are in summer. Beef also was difficult to be procuredand exceedingly poor; the price nearly sixpence farthing per pound. Thecorn was three current dollars per fanega, which is full five shillingsper bushel; and biscuit at twenty-five shillings for the hundred pounds.Poultry was so scarce that a good fowl cost three shillings. This istherefore not a place for ships to expect refreshments at a reasonableprice at this time of the year, wine excepted; but from March to Novembersupplies are plentiful, particularly fruit, of which at this time wecould procure none except a few dried figs and some bad oranges.NAUTICAL REMARKS.During our stay here the weather was fair with north-east winds and calmsand small drizzling rain in the night. The thermometer from 66 to 69degrees at noon in the shade. I could make no lunar observations for thelongitude, but by the help of the timekeeper I have computed thesituation of the town of Santa Cruz to be 28 degrees 28 minutes northlatitude and 16 degrees 18 minutes west longitude. I observed thevariation by two compasses to be 20 degrees 1 minute west: this muchexceeded what I could have imagined; for in 1776 I observed it only 14degrees 40 minutes west; a difference of above five degrees in elevenyears: and this makes me reflect on the uncertainty of obtaining theexact deviation of the magnetic pole, and of course its annual variationwhich never can be accurately ascertained unless the observations aremade always in one spot and with the same compass.Tenerife, though considerably without the tropic, is so nearly within thelimits of the tradewind that navigators generally steer to it from theeastward. The road of Santa Cruz lies on the east side of the island, atthe end of a range of craggy hills, barren and very lofty, along with yousail west by south by compass into the road, with a sea unfathomableuntil near the shore. The anchoring ground may be accounted from fiftyfathoms to twenty, or even fifteen. The bank is very steep and gives butlittle time to sound; for which reason it should be done effectually witha heavy lead, or a ship will be too near in before a stranger is aware ofit: he will likewise too soon expect to find bottom, owing to the greatdeception of the adjacent high land. To obviate these difficulties it isnecessary to observe that while a town which lies some distance to thesouthward of Santa Cruz is open with the castle on the south part of theroad, though you may appear near to the shore, there is no anchorage; butafter it is shut entirely in you get on the bank. The church bearing westor west by south and the south point of the road south-west half south tosouth-west by west is a good situation for anchoring: the depth abouttwenty-five fathoms. The distance from the shore will be three quartersof a mile; and the southernmost land that can be seen then will be a halfor quarter point of the compass farther out than the south point of theroad.The bottom is black soft mud, with some patches of rocks; for whichreason vessels that lie here any length of time buoy their cables. Thisprecaution, besides being useful in that particular, they think makesthem ride more easy when there is much sea setting into the road, which,with the wind any way to the southward of east or at south-west, must bevery considerable; it is therefore usual to moor with four anchors,though more than two are scarce ever of use. Mooring is however advisableif a ship is only to remain twenty-four hours, and the tighter thebetter, that the cables may keep clear of the ground.The landing on the beach is generally impracticable with our own boats,at least without great risk; but there is a very fine pier on whichpeople may land without difficulty if there is not much swell in theroad. To this pier the water is conveyed by pipes for the use ofshipping, and for which all merchant-ships pay.There is a degree of wretchedness and want among the lower class ofpeople which is not anywhere so common as among the Spanish andPortuguese settlements. To alleviate these evils the present governor ofTenerife has instituted a most charitable society which he takes thetrouble to superintend; and by considerable contributions a large airydwelling that contains one hundred and twenty poor girls and as many menand boys has been built and endowed with a sufficiency of land round it,not only for all present purposes but for enlarging the building for moreobjects of charity as their funds increase. I had the honour to be shownby his excellency this asylum (Hospicio they call it) where thereappeared in every countenance the utmost cheerfulness and content. Thedecency and neatness of the dress of the young females, with the order inwhich they were arranged at their spinning-wheels and looms in anextensive airy apartment, was admirable. A governess inspected andregulated all their works, which were the manufacturing of ribbons of allcolours, coarse linens, and tapes; all which were managed and brought toperfection by themselves from the silk and flax in their first state;even the dying of the colours is performed by them. These girls arereceived for five years, at the end of which they are at liberty tomarry, and have for their portions their wheel and loom, with a sum ofmoney proportioned to the state of the fund, which is assisted by theproduce of their labour, and at this time was estimated at two thousanddollars per annum.The men and boys are not less attended to: they are employed in coarserwork, blanketing and all kinds of common woollens: if they become infirmthey spend the remainder of their days here comfortably and under awatchful inspector who attends them in the same manner as the governessdoes the girls. They are all visited every day by the governor, and aclergyman attends them every evening. By this humane institution a numberof people are rendered useful and industrious in a country where thepoor, from the indulgence of the climate, are too apt to prefer a life ofinactivity, though attended with wretchedness, to obtaining the comfortsof life by industry and labour.The number of inhabitants in the island I was informed were estimated atbetween eighty and one hundred thousand. Their annual export of wine istwenty thousand pipes and of brandy half that quantity. Vessels arefrequently here from St. Eustatia, and from thence a great quantity ofTenerife wine is carried to the different parts of the West Indies, underthe name of Madeira.Tenerife is considered of more value than all the other Canaries: theinhabitants however, in scarce seasons, receive supplies from the GrandCanary; but their vineyards here are said to be greatly superior. Theirproduce of corn, though exceedingly good, is not sufficient for theirconsumption; and owing to this the Americans have an advantageous tradehere for their flour and grain, and take wine in return.The town of Santa Cruz is about half a mile in extent each way, built ina regular manner, and the houses in general large and airy, but thestreets are very ill paved. I am told that they are subject to fewdiseases; but if any epidemic distemper breaks out it is attended withthe most fatal consequences, particularly the smallpox, the bad effectsof which they now endeavour to counteract by inoculation. For this reasonthey are very circumspect in admitting ships to have communication withthe shore without bills of health.A sloop from London, called the Chance, William Meridith, master, boundto Barbados, out nineteen days from the Downs, came into the road the daybefore we sailed. She had suffered much by the bad weather but, havingbrought no bill of health, the governor would not allow any person tocome on shore unless I could vouch for them that no epidemic diseaseraged in England at the time they sailed, which I was able to do, itbeing nearly at the same time that I left the land; and by that meansthey had the governor's permission to receive the supplies they wantedwithout being obliged to perform quarantine.Thursday 10.Having finished our business at Tenerife on Thursday the 10th we sailedwith the wind at south-east, our ship's company all in good health andspirits.I now divided the people into three watches, and gave the charge of thethird watch to Mr. Fletcher Christian, one of the mates. I have alwaysconsidered this as a desirable regulation when circumstances will admitof it on many accounts; and am persuaded that unbroken rest not onlycontributes much towards the health of a ship's company but enables themmore readily to exert themselves in cases of sudden emergency.As it was my wish to proceed to Otaheite without stopping I orderedeverybody to be at two-thirds allowance of bread: I also directed thewater for drinking to be filtered though dripstones that I had bought atTenerife for that purpose.In the evening we passed the south end of Tenerife which is a round lumpof land that, from the lowness of the contiguous land, has at a distancethe appearance of a separate island. By our run from the bay of SantaCruz I make the latitude of the south end of Tenerife to be 28 degrees 6minutes north.We ran all night towards the south-south-west having the wind atsouth-east. The next morning we could see nothing of the land. I now madethe ship's company acquainted with the intent of the voyage and, havingbeen permitted to hold out this encouragement to them, I gave assurancesof the certainty of promotion to everyone whose endeavours should meritit.The winds for some days after leaving Tenerife were mostly from thesouthward. Fishing-lines and tackle were distributed amongst the peopleand some dolphins were caught.Thursday 17.On the 17th the wind came round to the north-east and continued steady inthat quarter till the 25th on which day at noon we were in 3 degrees 54minutes north. As the cloudiness of the sky gave us reason to expect muchrain we prepared the awnings with hoses for the convenience of savingwater, in which we were not disappointed. From this time to our meetingwith the south-east tradewind we had much wet weather, the air close andsultry with calms, and light variable winds generally from the southward.Tuesday 29.On the 29th there was so heavy a fall of rain that we caught sevenhundred gallons of water.Thursday 31.On the 31st, latitude at noon 2 degrees 5 minutes north, found a currentsetting to the north-east at the rate of fourteen miles in thetwenty-four hours. The thermometer was at 82 degrees in the shade, and 811/2 degrees at the surface of the sea, so that the air and the water werewithin half a degree of the same temperature. At eight o'clock in theevening we observed a violent rippling in the sea about half a mile tothe north-west of us which had very much the appearance of breakers. ThisI imagine to have been occasioned by a large school (or multitude) offish as it was exactly in the track the ship had passed, so that if anyreal shoal had been there we must have seen it at the close of theevening when a careful lookout was always kept. However if it hadappeared ahead of us instead of astern I should certainly have tacked toavoid it. To such appearances I attribute the accounts of many shoalswithin the tropics which cannot be found anywhere but in maps. Ourlatitude at this time was 2 degrees 8 minutes north and longitude 19degrees 43 minutes west. The next day we had more of these appearancesfrom the number of schools of fish by which the ship was surrounded.February. Saturday 2.This morning we saw a sail to the north-north-west but at too great adistance to distinguish what she was.Monday 4.Had very heavy rain during which we nearly filled all our empty watercasks. So much wet weather, with the closeness of the air, coveredeverything with mildew. The ship was aired below with fires andfrequently sprinkled with vinegar; and every little interval of dryweather was taken advantage of to open all the hatchways, and clean theship, and to have all the people's wet things washed and dried.With this weather and light unsteady winds we advanced but 2 1/2 degreesin twelve days; at the end of which time we were relieved by thesouth-east tradewind which we fell in with on the 6th at noon in latitude1 degree 21 minutes north and longitude 20 degrees 42 minutes west.Thursday 7.The next afternoon we crossed the equinoctial line in longitude 21degrees 50 minutes west. The weather became fine and the south-easttradewind was fresh and steady, with which we kept a point free from thewind and got to the southward at a good rate.The weather continuing dry we put some of our bread in casks, properlyprepared for its reception, to preserve it from vermin: this experimentwe afterwards found answered exceedingly well.Saturday 16.On the 16th at daylight we saw a sail to the southward. The next day wecame up with her and found her to be the British Queen, Simon Paul,master, from London, bound to the Cape of Good Hope on the whale-fishery.She sailed from Falmouth the 5th of December, eighteen days before I leftSpithead. By this ship I wrote to England. At sunset she was almost outof sight astern.Monday 18.In the course of this day's run the variation changed from west to east.According to our observations the true and magnetic meridians coincidedin latitude 20 degrees 0 minutes south and longitude 31 degrees 15minutes west. At noon we were in latitude 20 degrees 44 minutes south andlongitude 31 degrees 23 minutes west. In our advances towards the souththe wind had gradually veered round to the east and was at this time ateast-north-east. The weather after crossing the Line had been fine andclear, but the air so sultry as to occasion great faintness, thequicksilver in the thermometer in the daytime standing at between 81 and83 degrees, and one time at 85 degrees. In our passage through thenorthern tropic the air was temperate, the sun having then high southdeclination and the weather being generally fine till we lost thenorth-east tradewind; but such a thick haze surrounded the horizon thatno object could be seen except at a very small distance. The hazecommonly cleared away at sunset and gathered again at sunrise. Betweenthe north-east and south-east tradewinds the calms and rains, if of longcontinuance, are very liable to produce sickness unless great attentionis paid to keeping the ship clean and wholesome by giving all the airpossible, drying between decks with fires, and drying and airing thepeople's clothes and bedding. Besides these precautions we frequentlywetted with vinegar, and every evening the pumps were used asventilators. With these endeavours to secure health we passed the lowlatitudes without a single complaint.The currents we met with were by no means regular, nor have I ever foundthem so in the middle of the ocean. However from the channel to thesouthward as far as Madeira there is generally a current setting to thesouth-south-east.Thursday 21.On the evening of the 21st a ship was seen in the north-east but at toogreat a distance to distinguish of what country.Friday 22.The next day the wind came round to the north and north-west so that wecould no longer consider ourselves in the tradewind. Our latitude at noonwas 25 degrees 55 minutes south, longitude 36 degrees 29 minutes west.Variation of the compass three degrees east.Saturday 23.Towards night the wind died away and we had some heavy showers of rain ofwhich we profited by saving a ton of good water. The next day we caught ashark and five dolphins.Tuesday 26.We bent new sails and made other necessary preparations for encounteringthe weather that was to be expected in a high latitude. Our latitude atnoon was 29 degrees 38 minutes south, longitude 41 degrees 44 minuteswest. Variation 7 degrees 13 minutes east. In the afternoon, the windbeing westerly and blowing strong in squalls, some butterflies and otherinsects like what we call horseflies were blown on board of us. No birdswere seen except shearwaters. Our distance from the coast of Brazil atthis time was above 100 leagues.March. Sunday 2.In the forenoon, after seeing that every person was clean, divine servicewas performed according to my usual custom on this day. I gave to Mr.Fletcher Christian, whom I had before directed to take charge of thethird watch, a written order to act as lieutenant.Saturday 8.We were at noon in latitude 36 degrees 50 minutes south and longitude 52degrees 53 minutes west. The last four days we several times tried forsoundings without finding bottom, though considerably to the westward ofCaptain Wallis' track, who had soundings at fifty-four fathoms depth inlatitude 35 degrees 40 minutes south and longitude 49 degrees 54 minuteswest. This day we tried with two hundred and forty fathoms of line butdid not find bottom; at the same time, observing a rippling in the water,we tried the current by mooring a keg with one hundred fathoms of line,by which it appeared to run to the north-north-west at the rate of a mileand a half per hour. By the noon observation however we were eighteenmiles to the southward of our reckoning. In the afternoon we saw a turtlefloating and, not having much wind, hoisted a boat out and sent after it;but it was found to be in a putrid state with a number of crabs feedingupon it.The change of temperature began now to be sensibly felt, there being avariation in the thermometer since yesterday of eight degrees. That thepeople might not suffer by their own negligence I gave orders for theirlight tropical clothing to be put by, and made them dress in a mannermore suited to a cold climate. I had provided for this before I leftEngland by giving directions for such clothes to be purchased as werenecessary.Monday 10.In the forenoon we struck soundings at eighty-three fathoms depth; ourlatitude 40 degrees 8 minutes south and longitude 55 degrees 40 minuteswest. This I conclude to have been near the edge of the bank for, thewind being at south-south-west, we stood towards the south-east; andafter running fourteen miles in that direction we could find no bottomwith one hundred and sixty fathoms of line. In the night we stood towardsthe west-south-west with a southerly wind and got again into soundings.The next day we saw a great number of whales of an immense size that hadtwo spout-holes on the back of the head. Upon a complaint made to me bythe master I found it necessary to punish Matthew Quintal, one of theseamen, with two dozen lashes for insolence and mutinous behaviour.Before this I had not had occasion to punish any person on board.Wednesday 12.On the 12th we caught a porpoise by striking it with the grains. Everyoneeat heartily of it; and it was so well liked that no part was wasted.Friday 14.On the 14th in the afternoon we saw a land-bird like a lark, and passedpart of a dead whale that had been left by some whalers after they hadtaken the blubber off. Saw likewise two strange sail. The next day atnoon our latitude was 43 degrees 6 minutes south and longitude 58 degrees42 minutes west. Had soundings at seventy-five fathoms; the bottom a finegreenish sand. Saw two hawks.Sunday 16.On the 16th another ship was seen to the west-north-west standing to thenorthward. Latitude at noon 43 degrees 34 minutes south. We continuedrunning to the southward keeping in soundings.Wednesday 19.On the 19th at noon by my account we were within twenty leagues of PortDesire; but the wind blowing fresh from the north-west with thick foggyweather I did not attempt to make the land. We passed a good deal ofrock-weed and saw many whales, and albatrosses and other seabirds.Thursday 20.On the 20th at noon our latitude was 50 degrees 24 minutes south andlongitude 65 degrees 50 minutes west. In the afternoon the wind, whichhad for some time past been northerly, suddenly shifted to thewest-south-west and blew hard.Sunday 23.We steered to the south-south-east and on the 23rd at two o'clock in themorning we discovered the coast of Tierra del Fuego bearing south-east.At nine in the forenoon we were off Cape St. Diego, the eastern part ofTierra del Fuego. Observed the variation here to be 21 degrees 23 east.The wind being unfavourable I thought it more advisable to go round tothe eastward of Staten Land than to attempt passing through Straits leMaire. The two opposite coasts of the Straits exhibited very differentappearances. The land of Tierra del Fuego hereabouts, though the interiorparts are mountainous, yet near the coast is of a moderate height and, atthe distance we were from it, had not an unpromising appearance. Thecoast of Staten Land near the Straits is mountainous and craggy, andremarkable for its high peaked hills. Straits le Maire is a fair openingwhich cannot well be mistaken; but if any doubt could remain, thedifferent appearances of the opposite shores would sufficiently make theStraits known.I did not sail within less than six leagues of the coast that we mighthave the wind more regular and avoid being exposed to the heavy squallsthat came off from the land. At noon Cape St. Anthony bore south and thewesternmost of New Year's Isles south-east one-quarter south, five or sixleagues. Latitude observed 54 degrees 28 minutes south, longitude 64degrees 4 minutes west.The sight of New Year's Harbour almost tempted me to put in; but thelateness of the season and the people being in good health determined meto lay aside all thoughts of refreshment until we should reach Otaheite.At two o'clock in the afternoon the easternmost of New Year's Isles,where Captain Cook observed the latitude to be 55 degrees 40 minutessouth, bore from us south four leagues. We saw the entrance isles of NewYear's harbour at the back of which the land is very craggy andmountainous. This must be a very convenient port to touch at as theaccess to it is safe and easy. The harbour lies south-south-east bycompass from the north-east part of the easternmost of the New Year'sIslands.About two leagues to the westward of Cape St. John I observed theseparation of the mountains that Captain Cook has taken notice of, whichhas the appearance of Staten Land being there divided into two islands.At sunset Cape St. John bore south-south-east five or six leagues. Theland hereabouts is of less height and not so rugged as near New Year'sHarbour. The night coming on I could get no good view of the coast nearthe Cape; and at daylight next morning we were at too great a distance.Monday 24.We had stood to the southward all night with the wind at west-south-westand south-west. At eight in the morning Cape St. John bore north-west tenleagues distant. Soon after we lost sight of the land.From the result of my lunar observations, assisted by the timekeeper, Imake the longitude of the west side of Straits le Maire 64 degrees 48minutes west; the easternmost of the New Year's isles 63 degrees 52minutes west; and the longitude of Cape St. John 63 degrees 19 minuteswest.In our run from the latitude of 12 degrees south to 48 degrees south theship was set 2 degrees 30 minutes to the eastward by currents; and fromthe latitude of 48 degrees south to Staten Land the currents set us tothe westward 2 degrees 43 minutes; which I imagine to have beenoccasioned by an indraught into the Straits of Magellan.From the time we lost sight of the land to the end of the month we werestruggling with bad weather and contrary winds.Monday 31.But on the morning of the 31st the wind came to the north-north-east andmade us entertain great hopes that we should be able to accomplish ourpassage round the Cape without much difficulty. At noon we were inlatitude 60 degrees 1 minute south and in 71 degrees 45 minutes westlongitude, which is 8 degrees 26 minutes west of the meridian of Cape St.John. This flattering appearance was not of long continuance: in thenight the wind became variable and next day settled again in the west andnorth-west with very bad weather.April. Wednesday 2.On the 2nd in the morning the wind, which had blown fresh all night fromthe north-west, came round to the south-west and increased to a heavygale. At six in the morning the storm exceeded what I had ever met withbefore; and the sea, from the frequent shifting of the wind, running incontrary directions, broke exceeding high. Our ship however lay to verywell under a main and fore-stay sail. The gale continued with severesqualls of hail and sleet the remainder of this and all the next day.Friday 4.On the 4th the wind was less violent but far from moderate. With so muchbad weather I found it necessary to keep a constant fire night and day;and one of the watch always attended to dry the people's wet clothes: andthis I have no doubt contributed as much to their health as to theircomfort.Our companions in this in hospitable region were albatrosses and twobeautiful kinds of birds, the small blue petrel and pintada. A great manyof these were frequently about the wake of the ship, which induced thepeople to float a line with hooks baited to endeavour to catch them andtheir attempts were successful. The method they used was to fasten thebait a foot or two before the hook and, by giving the line a sudden jerkwhen the bird was at the bait, it was hooked in the feet or body.Sunday 6.On the 6th the weather was moderate and continued so till the 9th withthe wind veering between the north-west and south-west; of which we wereable to take advantage.Monday 7.On the 7th observed the variation 27 degrees 9 minutes east; our latitude60 degrees 24 minutes south and longitude 75 degrees 54 minutes west.Wednesday 9.On the 9th at noon we were in latitude 59 degrees 31 minutes south andour longitude 76 degrees 58 minutes west, which is farther to the westthan we had yet been. The weather was now unfavourable again, blowingstrong from the westward with a high sea.On the 10th we saw some fish which appeared spotted and about the size ofbonetos: these were the only fish we had seen in this high latitude.Saturday 12.The stormy weather continued with a great sea. The ship now began tocomplain and required to be pumped every hour; which was no more than wehad reason to expect from such a continuance of gales of wind and highseas. The decks also became so leaky that it was obliged to allot thegreat cabin, of which I made little use except in fine weather, to thosepeople who had wet berths to hang their hammocks in, and by this meansthe between decks was less crowded.Every morning all the hammocks were taken down from where they hung, andwhen the weather was too bad to keep them upon deck they were put in thecabin; so that the between decks were cleaned daily and aired with firesif the hatchways could not be opened. With all this bad weather we hadthe additional mortification to find at the end of every day that we werelosing ground; for notwithstanding our utmost exertions and keeping onthe most advantageous tacks (which if the weather had been at allmoderate would have sufficiently answered our purpose) yet the greaterpart of the time we were doing little better than drifting before thewind.Sunday 13.Birds as usual were about the ship and some of them caught; and for thefirst time since we left Staten Land we saw some whales. This morning,owing to the violent motion of the ship, the cook fell and broke one ofhis ribs, and another man, by a fall, dislocated his shoulder. The gunnerwho had the charge of a watch was laid up with the rheumatism: and thiswas the first sicklist that appeared on board the ship. The time of fullmoon which was approaching made me entertain hopes that after that periodwe should experience some change of wind or weather in our favour; butthe event did not at all answer our expectations. The latitude at noonthis day was 58 degrees 9 minutes south and longitude 76 degrees 1 minutewest.As we caught a good many birds but which were all lean and tasted fishywe tried an experiment upon them which succeeded admirably. By keepingthem cooped up and cramming them with ground corn they improvedwonderfully in a short time; so that the pintada birds became as fine asducks, and the albatrosses were as fat, and not inferior in taste to,fine geese. Some of the latter birds were caught that measured seven feetbetween the extremities of the wings when spread. This unexpected supplycame very opportunely; for none of our livestock remained except hogs,the sheep and poultry not being hardy enough to stand the severity of theweather.Sunday 20.This morning the wind died away and we had a calm for a few hours whichgave us hopes that the next would be a more favourable wind. A hog waskilled for the ship's company which gave them an excellent meal. Towardsnoon, to our great disappointment, the wind sprang up again from thewestward and in the afternoon blew strong with snow and hailstorms.Monday 21.This was the second day after the full moon but, as I have remarkedbefore, it had no influence on the weather. At noon our latitude was 58degrees 31 minutes south and longitude 70 degrees 7 minutes west, whichis near seven degrees to the eastward of our situation on the morning ofthe 9th instant, when we had advanced the farthest in our power to thewestward, being then in 76 degrees 58 minutes west, three degrees to thewest of Cape Deseada, the west part of the Straits of Magellan; and atthis time we were 3 degrees 52 minutes to the east of it and hourlylosing ground.It was with much concern I saw how hopeless and even unjustifiable it wasto persist any longer in attempting a passage this way to the SocietyIslands. We had been thirty days in this tempestuous ocean. At one timewe had advanced so far to the westward as to have a fair prospect ofmaking our passage round; but from that period hard gales of westerlywind had continued without intermission, a few hours excepted, which, toborrow an expression in Lord Anson's voyage, were "like the elementsdrawing breath to return upon us with redoubled violence." The season wasnow too far advanced for us to expect more favourable winds or weather,and we had sufficiently experienced the impossibility of beating roundagainst the wind, or of advancing at all without the help of a fair windfor which there was little reason to hope. Another consideration whichhad great weight with me was that, if I persisted in my attempt this wayand should after all fail to get round, it would occasion such a loss oftime that our arrival at Otaheite soon enough to return in the properseason by the East Indies would be rendered precarious. On the other handthe prevalence of the westerly winds in high southern latitudes left meno reason to doubt of making a quick passage to the Cape of Good Hope andthence to the eastward round New Holland.Tuesday 22.Having maturely considered all circumstances I determined to bear awayfor the Cape of Good Hope; and at five o'clock on the evening of the22nd, the wind then blowing strong at west, I ordered the helm to be puta weather, to the great joy of every person on board. Our sicklist atthis time had increased to eight, mostly with rheumatic complaints: inother respects the people were in good health, though exceedingly jaded.The passage round Cape Horn into the South Seas during the summer monthshas seldom been attended with difficulty and is to be preferred in themoderate seasons to the more distant route to the eastward round the Capeof Good Hope and New Holland. If we had been one month earlier, orperhaps less, I doubt not but we should have effected our passage.The soundings that are met with off the coast of America, from thelatitude of 36 degrees south to the southward, are very convenient toenable ships to judge of their distance from the land, as thick fogs arevery frequent near that coast. If the winds are favourable, to go throughStraits le Maire must considerably shorten the passage round Cape Horn,as all the distance saved is so much gained to the westward. I aminformed that several harbours have been lately discovered by the SouthSea whalers on the north side of Staten Island that afford safe anchoragewith supplies of wood and water.While we were off Cape Horn I did not observe that our situation was atall affected by currents.CHAPTER 3.Passage towards the Cape of Good Hope and Search after Tristan da Cunha.Arrival at False Bay.Occurrences there.Reports concerning the Grosvenor's People.Departure from the Cape.1788. April. Friday 25.The westerly winds and stormy weather continuing gave me no reason torepent of my determination. On the 25th at noon we were in latitude 54degrees 16 minutes south and longitude 57 degrees 4 minutes west. Thenearest of the Falkland Islands by my reckoning then bore north 13degrees west; distance 23 leagues. Our stock of water being sufficient toserve us to the Cape of Good Hope I did not think it worth while to stopat these islands as the refreshment we might obtain there would scarcerepay us for the expense of time: we therefore continued our coursetowards the north-east and east-north-east.May. Friday 9.On the 9th of May at eight o'clock in the evening we were near thesituation of Tristan da Cunha, our latitude being 37 degrees 7 minutessouth and longitude 15 degrees 26 minutes west. All the afternoon theweather had been clear enough for land of a moderate height to be seen atleast seven leagues; I therefore concluded that we had not yet passed themeridian of the island; for the most western position given to it fromany authority is 15 degrees 0 minutes west.As I wished to make this island we kept our wind on different tacksduring the night, that we might be nearly in the same place at daylightin the morning as on the preceding evening: in the morning no land beingin sight we continued to steer to the eastward.Saturday 10.We ran on all day having clear weather but without seeing anything toindicate our being near land. At noon our latitude observed was 37degrees 27 minutes south which, being more to the southward than we hadreason to expect, I altered the course to the northward and steerednorth-east all the afternoon. At six o'clock in the evening we were inlatitude 37 degrees 0 minutes south and longitude 12 degrees 42 minuteswest, having a clear horizon but not the least sign of being in theneighbourhood of land. With the night came thick rainy weather and wewere now to the eastward of the situation ascribed to Tristan da Cunha; Itherefore determined to give over the search and to resume our coursetowards the Cape of Good Hope.The island of Tristan da Cunha, by Robertson's Elements, is laid down in37 degrees 12 minutes south latitude and 13 degrees 23 minutes westlongitude. In Captain Cook's general map, prefixed to his last voyage, itis placed in the same latitude but in 15 degrees west longitude. From ourtrack and the clearness of the weather I am convinced, if the latitudeascribed to it as above is correct, that it is not to be found betweenthe meridians of 16 degrees 30 minutes west and 12 degrees 30 minuteswest. On the 13th I had a number of lunar observations for the longitude,the mean of which agreed exactly with the timekeeper.*(*Footnote. In Mr. Dalrymple's Collection of Plans which I had not withme the northernmost of the Islands of Tristan d'Acunha is placed inlatitude 37 degrees 22 minutes south and longitude 13 degrees 17 minuteswest. I think it probable we missed them by being too much to thenorthward.)In this passage the weather was generally so cloudy that I had fewopportunities to make observations of any kind except for the noonlatitudes. I could not determine when we crossed the line of novariation. The two nearest observations to it were: the first in 39degrees 51 minutes south latitude and 26 degrees 11 minutes westlongitude, where the variation of the compass was found to be 3 degrees17 minutes east; and the other in latitude 35 degrees 30 minutes southand longitude 5 degrees 21 minutes west, where I observed the variation11 degrees 35 minutes west; between these we had no intermediateobservation for the variation.Thursday 22.At two in the afternoon we saw the Table Mountain of the Cape of GoodHope. As it is reckoned unsafe riding in Table Bay at this time of year Isteered for False Bay. The next evening we anchored in the outer part.Saturday 24.And on the forenoon of the 24th got the ship secured in Simon's Bay,which is in the inner part of False Bay. When moored, Noah's ark boresouth 35 degrees east three-quarters of a mile, and the hospital south 72west. We found lying here one outward bound Dutch Indiaman, five otherDutch ships, and a French ship.After saluting the fort, which was returned by an equal number of guns, Iwent on shore and dispatches were sent away to Cape Town to acquaint thegovernor of our arrival. A Dutch ship at this time lying in Table Baybound for Europe, I sent letters by her to the Admiralty. It is veryunusual for ships to be in Table Bay so late in the year, on account ofthe strong north-west winds. April is the time limited.I gave the necessary directions for getting our wants supplied. The shiprequired to be caulked in every part for she was become so leaky that wehad been obliged to pump every hour in our passage from Cape Horn. Thiswe immediately set about, as well as repairing our sails and rigging. Thesevere weather we had met with and the leakiness of the ship made itnecessary to examine into the state of all the stores and provisions. Ofthe latter a good deal was found damaged, particularly the bread. Thetimekeeper I took on shore to ascertain its rate, and other instrumentsto make the necessary astronomical observations. Fresh meat, with softbread and plenty of vegetables, were issued daily to the ship's companythe whole time we remained here. A few days after our arrival I went overto Cape Town and waited on his excellency M. Vander Graaf, the governor,who obligingly arranged matters so much to our advantage that we scarcelyfelt the inconvenience of being at a distance from the Cape Town, whencewe received all our supplies.The Cape Town is considerably increased within the last eight years. Itsrespectability with regard to strength has kept pace with its otherenlargements and rendered it very secure against any attempt which is notmade with considerable force. Great attention is paid to military orderand discipline; and monthly signals are established to communicate withtheir shipping as they arrive near the coast that they may not rununawares into the hands of an enemy. I found everything much dearer thanwhen I was here in 1780. Sheep cost four Spanish dollars each and were sosmall that it answered better to purchase the mutton for the ship's dailyuse at fourpence per pound.During our stay here I took care to procure seeds and plants that wouldbe valuable at Otaheite and the different places we might touch at in ourway thither. In this I was greatly assisted by colonel Gordon, thecommander of the troops. In company with this gentleman the loss of theGrosvenor East Indiaman was mentioned: on this subject colonel Gordonexpressed great concern that from anything he had said hopes were stillentertained to flatter the affectionate wishes of the surviving friendsof those unfortunate people. He said that in his travels into the Caffrecountry he had met with a native who described to him that there was awhite woman among his countrymen who had a child, and that she frequentlyembraced the child and cried most violently. This was all he (thecolonel) could understand and, being then on his return home with hishealth much impaired by fatigue, the only thing that he could do was tomake a friend of the native by presents and promises of reward oncondition that he would take a letter to this woman and bring him back ananswer. Accordingly he wrote letters in English, French, and Dutchdesiring that some sign or mark might be returned, either by writing witha burnt stick or by any means she should be able to devise, to satisfyhim that she was there; and that on receiving such token from her everyeffort should be made to ensure her safety and escape. But the Caffre,although apparently delighted with the commission which he hadundertaken, never returned, nor has the colonel ever heard anything moreof him, though he had been instructed in methods of conveying informationthrough the Hottentot country.To this account, that I may not again have occasion to introduce somelancholy a subject, I shall add the little information I receivedrespecting it when I revisited the Cape in my return towards Europe. Areputable farmer of the name of Holhousen, who lives at Swellendam, eightdays journey from the Cape, had information from some Caffre Hottentotsthat at a kraal or village in their country there were white men andwomen. On this intelligence Mr. Holhousen asked permission of thegovernor to make an expedition with some of the farmers into the country,requiring a thousand rix-dollars to bear his expenses. The governorreferred him to Mr. Wocke, the Landros of Graaf Rienet, a new colony inhis way. But from the place where Mr. Holhousen lives to the Landros, Mr.Wocke's residence, is a month's journey, which he did not choose toundertake at an uncertainty, as Mr. Wocke might have disapproved of theenterprise. It was in October last that Mr. Holhousen offered to go onthis service. He was one of the party who went along the sea-coast insearch of these unfortunate people when a few of them first made theirappearance at the Cape. I am however informed that the Dutch farmers arefond of making expeditions into the country, that they may haveopportunities of taking away cattle; and this I apprehend to be one ofthe chief reasons why undertakings of this kind are not encouraged.On the 13th of June the Dublin East Indiaman arrived from England, onboard of which ship was a party of the 77th regiment under the command ofcolonel Balfour.The result of my lunar observations gave for the longitude of Simon's Bay18 degrees 48 minutes 34 seconds east; the latitude 34 degrees 11 minutes34 seconds south. The timekeeper likewise made the longitude 18 degrees47 minutes east. The longitude as established by former observations is18 degrees 33 minutes east. The variation of the compass on shore was 24degrees 4 minutes west; but on board of the ship it was only 22 degrees28 minutes west. The time of high-water was three-quarters past two onthe full and change and it then flowed six feet.With respect to the Cape Promontory it lies about three miles east of themeridian of Simon's Town. All the tables of latitude and longitude placethe Cape in 34 degrees 29 minutes south latitude; but from manyobservations off it with good instruments I make it to lie in 34 degrees23 minutes south, which agrees with its situation as laid down in majorRennel's map. The part which I call the Cape is the southernmost point ofthe land between Table Bay and False Bay; but the Dutch consider thewesternmost part of the coast to be the Cape.Sunday 29.On the 29th, being ready for sea, I took the timekeeper and instrumentson board. The error of the timekeeper was 3 33 seconds, 2 too slow forthe mean time at Greenwich, and its rate of going 3 seconds per day,losing. The thermometer during our stay here was from 51 to 66 degrees.July. Tuesday 1.We had been thirty-eight days at this place, and my people had receivedall the advantage that could be derived from the refreshments of everykind that are here to be met with. We sailed at four o'clock thisafternoon, and saluted the platform with thirteen guns as we ran out ofthe bay, which were returned.CHAPTER 4.Passage towards Van Diemen's Land.Make the Island of St. Paul.Arrival in Adventure Bay.Natives seen.Sail from Van Diemen's Land.1788. July.We lost sight of the land the day after leaving False Bay and steeredtowards the east-south-east, having variable winds the first week withmuch thunder, lightning and rain. The remainder of this passage the windswere mostly between the south and west blowing strong. There were almostevery day great numbers of pintada, albatrosses, blue petrels, and otheroceanic birds about us; but it was observed that if the wind came fromthe northward, only for a few hours, the birds generally left us, andtheir presence again was the forerunner of a southerly wind.Sunday 13.The variation of the compass was 30 degrees 34 minutes west which was thegreatest variation we found in this track. Our latitude 36 degrees 28minutes south and longitude 39 degrees 0 minutes east.Sunday 20.The latitude at noon was 40 degrees 30 minutes south and longitude 60degrees 7 minutes east. We were at this time scudding under the fore-sailand close-reefed main-top-sail, the wind blowing strong from the west. Anhour after noon the gale increased and blew with so much violence thatthe ship was almost driven forecastle under before we could get the sailsclewed up. As soon as the sails were taken in we brought the ship to thewind, lowered the lower yards, and got the top-gallant-masts upon deck,which eased the ship very much.Monday 21.We remained lying to till eight the next morning when we bore away undera reefed fore-sail. In the afternoon the sea ran so high that it becamevery unsafe to stand on: we therefore brought to the wind again, andremained lying to all night without accident excepting that the man atthe steerage was thrown over the wheel and much bruised.Tuesday 22.Towards noon the violence of the storm abated and we again bore awayunder the reefed fore-sail. Our latitude at noon 38 degrees 49 minutessouth: in the afternoon saw some whales.We continued running to the eastward in this parallel, it being myintention to make the island St. Paul.Monday 28.On Monday the 28th at six in the morning we saw the island bearing eastby north 12 leagues distant: between 10 and 11 o'clock we ran along thesouth side at about a league distant from the shore. There was a verdurethat covered the higher parts of the land, but I believe it was nothingmore than moss which is commonly found on the tops of most rocky islandsin these latitudes. We saw several whales near the shore. The extent ofthis island is five miles from east to west; and about two or three fromnorth to south. As we passed the east end we saw a remarkable highsugarloaf rock, abreast of which I have been informed is good anchoragein 23 fathoms, the east point bearing south-west by south by truecompass. I had this information from the captain of a Dutch packet inwhich I returned to Europe. He likewise said there was good fresh wateron the island and a hot spring which boiled fish in as great perfectionas on a fire. By his account the latitude which he observed in the roadis 38 degrees 39 minutes south; and from the anchoring place the islandof Amsterdam was in sight to the northward. We had fair weather all theforenoon, but just at noon a squall came on which was unfavourable forour observation. I had however two sets of double altitudes and a goodaltitude exactly at noon according to the timekeeper. The result of thesegave for the latitude of the centre of St. Paul 38 degrees 47 minutessouth. The longitude I make 77 degrees 39 minutes east. The variation ofthe compass, taking the mean of what it was observed to be the day beforewe saw the island and the day after, is 19 degrees 30 minutes west.At noon we were three leagues past the island. We kept on towards theeast-south-east, and for several days continued to see rock-weed, whichis remarked to be generally the case after ships pass St. Paul's; but tothe westward of it very seldom any is seen.August. Wednesday 13.In latitude 44 degrees 16 minutes south, longitude 122 degrees 7 minuteseast, I observed the variation of the compass to be 6 degrees 23 minuteswest. I had no opportunity to observe it again till in the latitude of 43degrees 56 minutes south, longitude 133 degrees 16 minutes east, when itwas 1 degree 38 minutes east; so that we had passed the line of novariation. In 1780, on board the Resolution in latitude 44 degrees 23minutes south, longitude 131 degrees 28 minutes east, the variation wasobserved 6 degrees 0 minutes west, which is a remarkable difference. Wehad much bad weather with snow and hail, and in our approach to VanDiemen's Land nothing was seen to indicate the nearness of the coast,except a seal, when we were within the distance of 20 leagues.Tuesday 19.At ten o'clock this afternoon we saw the rock named the Mewstone, thatlies near the south-west cape of Van Diemen's Land, bearing north-eastabout six leagues. The wind blew strong from the north-west. As soon aswe had passed the Mewstone we were sheltered from a very heavy sea whichran from the westward. At eight o'clock at night we were abreast of thesouth cape when the wind became light and variable. Saw several firesinland.The Mewstone is a high bold rock that lies five leagues to the south-eastof the south-west cape and is the part that all ships bound this wayshould endeavour to make. Its latitude is 43 degrees 46 or 47 minutes.Several islands lie to the northward between that and the main, amongwhich, bearing north by west from the Mewstone, is a high rock muchresembling it; and north-north-east from the Mewstone, on the mainland,is a remarkable high mountain, which in this direction appears notchedlike a cock's comb; but as viewed from the eastward seems round.Wednesday 20.All the 20th we were endeavouring to get into Adventure Bay but wereprevented by variable winds. The next morning at five o'clock we anchoredin the outer part, and at sunrise weighed again: at noon we anchored wellin the bay and moored the ship, Penguin Island bearing north 57 1/2degrees east, about two miles distant; Cape Frederic Henry north 23degrees east; and the mouth of the Lagoon south 16 degrees east.In our passage from the Cape of Good Hope the winds were mostly from thewestward with very boisterous weather: but one great advantage that thisseason of the year has over the summer months is in being free from fogs.I have already remarked that the approach of strong southerly winds isannounced by many kinds of birds of the albatross or petrel tribe, andthe abatement of the gale, or a shift of wind to the northward, by theirkeeping away. The thermometer also very quickly shows when a change ofthese winds may be expected by varying sometimes six and seven degrees inits height. I have reason to believe that, after we passed the island St.Paul, there was a westerly current; the ship being every day to thewestward of the reckoning, which in the whole, from St. Paul to VanDiemen's land, made a difference of four degrees between the longitude bythe reckoning and the true longitude.Thursday 21.The ship being moored I went in a boat to look out for the mostconvenient place to wood and water at, which I found to be at the westend of the beach: for the surf, though considerable, was less there thanat any other part of the bay. The water was in a gully about sixty yardsfrom the beach; it was perfectly good but, being only a collection fromthe rains, the place is always dry in the summer months; for we found nowater in it when I was here with Captain Cook in January 1777. We hadvery little success in hauling the seine; about twenty small flounders,and flat-headed fish called foxes were all that were taken.I found no signs of the natives having lately frequented this bay or ofany European vessels having been here since the Resolution and Discoveryin 1777. From some of the old trunks of trees then cut down I saw shootsabout twenty-five feet high and fourteen inches in circumference.In the evening I returned on board.Friday 22.The next morning, the 22nd, at daylight, a party was sent on shore forwooding and watering under the command of Mr. Christian and the gunner;and I directed that one man should be constantly employed in washing thepeople's clothes. There was so much surf that the wood was obliged to berafted off in bundles to the boat. Mr. Nelson informed me that in hiswalks today he saw a tree in a very healthy state which he measured andfound to be thirty-three feet and a half in girt; its height wasproportioned to its bulk.Saturday 23.The surf was rather greater than yesterday which very much interruptedour wooding and watering. Nelson today picked up a male opossum that hadbeen recently killed, or had died, for we could not perceive any woundunless it had received a blow on the back where there was a bare placeabout the size of a shilling. It measured fourteen inches from the earsto the beginning of the tail which was exactly the same length.Most of the forest trees were at this time shedding their bark. There arethree kinds, which are distinguished from each other by their leaves,though the wood appears to be the same. Many of them are full one hundredand fifty feet high; but most of those that we cut down were decayed atthe heart. There are, besides the forest trees, several other kinds thatare firm good wood and may be cut for most purposes except masts; neitherare the forest trees good for masts, on account of their weight, and thedifficulty of finding them thoroughly sound. Mr. Nelson asserted thatthey shed their bark every year, and that they increase more from theseed than by suckers.I found the tide made a difference of full two feet in the height of thewater in the lake at the back of the beach. At high water it was verybrackish, but at low tide it was perfectly fresh to the taste, and soapshowed no sign of its being the least impregnated. We had better successin fishing on board the ship than by hauling the seine on shore; for withhooks and lines a number of fine rock-cod were caught. I saw todayseveral eagles, some beautiful blue-plumaged herons, and a great varietyof parakeets. A few oyster-catchers and gulls were generally about thebeach, and in the lake a few wild ducks.Monday 25.Being in want of plank I directed a saw-pit to be dug and employed someof the people to saw trees into plank. The greater part of this week thewinds were moderate with unsettled weather.Friday 29.On Friday it blew strong from the south-west with rain, thunder, andlightning. We continued to catch fish in sufficient quantities foreverybody and had better success with the seine. We were fortunate alsoin angling in the lake where we caught some very fine tench. Some of thepeople felt a sickness from eating mussels that were gathered from therocks; but I believe it was occasioned by eating too many. We found somespider-crabs, most of them not good, being the female sort and out ofseason. The males were tolerably good and were known by the smallness oftheir two fore-claws or feeders. We saw the trunk of a dead tree on whichhad been cut A.D. 1773. The figures were very distinct; even the slipsmade with the knife were discernible. This must have been done by some ofcaptain Furneaux's people in March 1773, fifteen years before. The marksof the knife remaining so unaltered, I imagine the tree must have beendead when it was cut; but it serves to show the durability of the woodfor it was perfectly sound at this time. I shot two gannets: these birdswere of the same size as those in England; their colour is a beautifulwhite, with the wings and tail tipped with jet black and the top and backof the head of a very fine yellow. Their feet were black with four claws,on each of which was a yellow line the whole length of the foot. The billwas four inches long, without nostrils, and very taper and sharp-pointed.The east side of the bay being not so thick of wood as the other parts,and the soil being good, I fixed on it, at Nelson's recommendation, asthe most proper situation for planting some of the fruit-trees which Ihad brought from the Cape of Good Hope. A circumstance much againstanything succeeding here is that in the dry season the fires made by thenatives are apt to communicate to the dried grass and underwood, and tospread in such a manner as to endanger everything that cannot bear asevere scorching. We however chose what we thought the safest situations,and planted three fine young apple-trees, nine vines, six plantain-trees,a number of orange and lemon-seed, cherry-stones, plum, peach, andapricot-stones, pumpkins, also two sorts of Indian corn, and apple andpear kernels. The ground is well adapted for the trees, being of a richloamy nature. The spot where we made our plantation was clear ofunderwood; and we marked the trees that stood nearest to the differentthings which were planted. Nelson followed the circuit of the bay,planting in such places as appeared most eligible. I have great hopesthat some of these articles will succeed. The particular situations I haddescribed in my survey of this place, but I was unfortunately preventedfrom bringing it home. Near the watering place likewise we planted on aflat, which appeared a favourable situation, some onions, cabbage-roots,and potatoes.For some days past a number of whales were seen in the bay. They were ofthe same kind as those we had generally met with before, having twoblow-holes on the back of the head.September. Monday 1.On the night of the 1st of September we observed for the first time signsof the natives being in the neighbourhood. Fires were seen on the lowland near Cape Frederick Henry, and at daylight we saw the natives withour glasses. As I expected they would come round to us I remained all theforenoon near the wooding and watering parties, making observations, themorning being very favourable for that purpose. I was howeverdisappointed in my conjecture for the natives did not appear, and therewas too great a surf for a boat to land on the part where we had seenthem.Tuesday 2.The natives not coming near us, I determined to go after them, and we setout in a boat towards Cape Frederick Henry, where we arrived about eleveno'clock. I found landing impracticable and therefore came to a grapnel,in hopes of their coming to us, for we had passed several fires. Afterwaiting near an hour I was surprised to see Nelson's assistant come outof the wood: he had wandered thus far in search of plants and told methat he had met with some of the natives. Soon after we heard theirvoices like the cackling of geese, and twenty persons came out of thewood, twelve of whom went round to some rocks where the boat could getnearer to the shore than we then were. Those who remained behind werewomen.We approached within twenty yards of them, but there was no possibilityof landing and I could only throw to the shore, tied up in paper, thepresents which I intended for them. I showed the different articles as Itied them up, but they would not untie the paper till I made anappearance of leaving them. They then opened the parcels and, as theytook the articles out, placed them on their heads. On seeing this Ireturned towards them when they instantly put everything out of theirhands and would not appear to take notice of anything that we had giventhem. After throwing a few more beads and nails on shore I made signs forthem to go to the ship, and they likewise made signs for me to land, butas this could not be effected I left them, in hopes of a nearer interviewat the watering-place.When they first came in sight they made a prodigious clattering in theirspeech and held their arms over their heads. They spoke so quick that Icould not catch one single word they uttered. We recollected one man whomwe had formerly seen among the party of the natives that came to us in1777, and who is particularised in the account of Captain Cook's lastvoyage for his humour and deformity. Some of them had a small stick, twoor three feet long, in their hands, but no other weapon.Their colour, as Captain Cook remarks, is a dull black: their skin isscarified about their shoulders and breast. They were of a middlestature, or rather below it. One of them was distinguished by his bodybeing coloured with red ochre, but all the others were painted black witha kind of soot which was laid on so thick over their faces and shouldersthat it is difficult to say what they were like.They ran very nimbly over the rocks, had a very quick sight, and caughtthe small beads and nails which I threw to them with great dexterity.They talked to us sitting on their heels with their knees close intotheir armpits and were perfectly naked.In my return towards the ship I landed at the point of the harbour nearPenguin Island, and from the hills saw the water on the other side of thelow isthmus of Cape Frederick Henry, which forms the bay of that name. Itis very extensive and in, or near, the middle of the bay there is a lowisland. From this spot it has the appearance of being a very good andconvenient harbour.The account which I had from Brown, the botanist's assistant, was that inhis search for plants he had met an old man, a young woman, and two orthree children. The old man at first appeared alarmed, but becamefamiliar on being presented with a knife. He nevertheless sent away theyoung woman who went very reluctantly. He saw some miserable wigwams, inwhich were nothing but a few kangaroo skins spread on the ground, and abasket made of rushes.Among the wood that we cut here we found many scorpions and centipedes,with numerous black ants that were an inch long. We saw no mosquitoes,though in the summer months they are very troublesome.What is called the New Zealand tea plant grew here in great abundance; sothat it was not only gathered and dried to use as tea but made excellentbrooms. It bears a small pointed leaf of a pleasant smell, and its seedis contained in a berry, about the size of a pea, notched into five equalparts on the top. The soil on the west and south sides of the bay isblack mould with a mixture of fine white sand and is very rich. The treesare lofty and large, and the underwood grows so close together that inmany places it is impassable. The east side of the bay is a rich loamysoil; but near the tops of the hills is very much encumbered with stonesand rocks: the underwood thinly placed and small. The trees on the south,south-east, and south-west sides of the hills grow to a larger size thanthose that are exposed to the opposite points; for the sides of the treesopen or exposed to the north winds are naked with few branches; while theother sides are in a flourishing state. From this I do not infer that theequatorial are more hurtful than the polar winds; but that the trees bytheir situation were more sheltered from the one for from the other.Wednesday 3.A calm prevented our sailing today. The friendly interview which we hadhad with the natives made me expect that they would have paid us a visit;but we saw nothing more of them except fires in the night upon the lowland to the northward.The result of the observations which I made here, reduced to PenguinIsland, place it in 43 degrees 21 minutes 11 seconds south latitude andin longitude 147 degrees 33 minutes 29 seconds east, which scarcelydiffers from the observations made in 1777. The variation of the compassobserved on shore was 8 degrees 38 minutes east; and on board the ship 8degrees 29 minutes east. It was high-water at the change of the moon at49 minutes past six in the morning. The rise was two feet eight inches.Southerly winds, if of any continuance, make a considerable difference inthe height of the tides.Thursday 4.This forenoon, having a pleasant breeze at north-west, we weighed anchorand sailed out of Adventure Bay. At noon the southernmost part of Maria'sIsles bore north 52 degrees east, about five leagues distant; PenguinIsland south 86 degrees west; and Cape Frederick Henry north 65 degreeswest. In this position we had soundings at 57 fathoms, a sandy bottom.Latitude observed 43 degrees 22 minutes south.The southern part of Maria's Islands lie in latitude 43 degrees 16minutes south. The country is not in general woody, but in some of theinterior parts there appeared great abundance. Among these islands I haveno doubt of there being many convenient places for shipping. On the eastside in latitude 42 degrees 42 minutes south and longitude 148 degrees 24minutes east in July, 1789, Captain Cox of the Mercury found a convenientand secure harbour from all winds which he named Oyster Bay. Here hefound wood, water, and fish in great abundance. It has two outlets andlies north, a little easterly, distant 34 miles from thesouth-easternmost island, or point, seen from Adventure Bay.Adventure Bay is a convenient and safe place for any number of ships totake in wood and water during the summer months: but in the winter, whenthe southerly winds are strong, the surf, on all parts of the shore,makes the landing exceedingly troublesome. The bay of Frederick Henry mayperhaps be found preferable, as it appears to be equally easy of access.The soundings in Adventure Bay are very regular: near the west shore aresome patches of weed but no shoal or danger, the depth on them being fromfive to nine fathoms.CHAPTER 5.Rocky Islands discovered.See the Island Maitea and arrive at Otaheite.Ship crowded by the Natives.1788. September.Being clear of the land we steered towards the east-south-east, it beingmy intention to pass to the southward of New Zealand, as I expected inthat route to meet with constant westerly winds; in which however I wasdisappointed, for they proved variable and frequently from the eastwardblowing strong, with thick misty weather. The thermometer varied from 41to 46 degrees.Sunday 14.On the 14th at noon we were in 49 degrees 24 minutes south latitude andin 168 degrees 3 minutes east longitude, which is on the same meridianwith the south end of New Zealand. We altered our course, steering to thenorthward of east, and frequently saw rock-weed which I supposed to havedrifted from New Zealand. The sea now became rougher from our beingexposed to a long swell which came from the north-east.Friday 19.On the 19th at daylight we discovered a cluster of small rocky islandsbearing east by north four leagues distant from us. We had seen no birdsor anything to indicate the nearness of land except patches of rock-weed,for which the vicinity of New Zealand sufficiently accounted. The windbeing at north-east prevented our near approach to these isles; so thatwe were not less than three leagues distant in passing to the southwardof them. The weather was too thick to see distinctly: their extent wasonly 3 1/2 miles from east to west and about half a league from north tosouth: their number including the smaller ones was thirteen. I could notobserve any verdure on any of them: there were white spots like patchesof snow but, as Captain Cook, in describing the land of New Zealand, nearCape South, says, in many places there are patches like white marble, itis probable that what we saw might be of the same kind as what he hadobserved. The westernmost of these islands is the largest; they are ofsufficient height to be seen at the distance of seven leagues from aship's deck. When the easternmost bore north I tried for soundings, beingthen 10 miles distant from the nearest of them, and found bottom at 75fathoms, a fine white sand: and again at noon, having run six leaguesmore to the east-south-east, we had soundings at 104 fathoms, a finebrimstone-coloured sand. The latitude of these islands is 47 degrees 44minutes south; their longitude 179 degrees 7 minutes east, which is about145 leagues to the east of the Traps, near the south end of New Zealand.Variation of the compass here 17 degrees east. While in sight of theislands we saw some penguins, and a white kind of gull with a forkedtail. Captain Cook's track in 1773 was near this spot, but he did not seethe islands: he saw seals and penguins hereabouts, but considered NewZealand to be the nearest land. I have named them after the ship theBounty Isles.Sunday 21.This day we saw a seal, some rock-weed, and a great many albatrosses. Itried for soundings but found no bottom at 230 fathoms depth. Ourlatitude 47 degrees 32 minutes south, longitude 182 degrees 36 minuteseast.October. Thursday 2.Were in 40 degrees 27 minutes south latitude and 214 degrees 4 minuteseast longitude. It being calm, and a number of small blubbers about theship, I took up some in a bucket, but I saw no difference between themand the common blubbers in the West Indies. We frequently in thenight-time observed the sea to be covered with luminous spots caused byprodigious quantities of small blubbers that, from the strings whichextend from them, emit a light like the blaze of a candle, while the bodycontinues perfectly dark.Friday 3.The 3rd in the morning we saw a seal. Captain Cook has remarked seeingseaweed when nearly in the same place. Our latitude 40 degrees 21 minutessouth, longitude 215 degrees east. Variation of the compass 7 degrees 45minutes east. Being now well to the eastward of the Society Islands Isteered more to the northward.We continued to have the southern oceanic birds accompany us and a fewwhales. The people caught albatrosses and fattened them in the samemanner which they had done when off Cape Horn. Some of these measurednear eight feet between the tips of the wings when spread.Thursday 9.On Thursday the 9th we had the misfortune to lose one of our seamen,James Valentine, who died in the night of an asthmatic complaint. Thispoor man had been one of the most robust people on board until ourarrival at Adventure Bay, where he first complained of some slightindisposition for which he was bled, and got better. Some time afterwardsthe arm in which he had been bled became painful and inflamed: theinflammation increased, with a hollow cough, and extreme difficulty ofbreathing, to his death.Monday 13.The 13th in the afternoon we saw two land birds like what are calledsand-larks. Our latitude at this time was 28 degrees 3 minutes south andlongitude 223 degrees 26 minutes east.Tuesday 14.The next morning we saw a tropic bird and some fish. The winds were lightand variable with calms from this time to the 19th, when a breeze sprangup from the north-east, which gradually came round to the eastward andproved to be the tradewind. Our latitude on the 19th at noon was 24degrees 13 minutes south, longitude 222 degrees 17 minutes east.Variation of the compass 5 degrees 19 minutes east.Saturday 25.On the 25th at half-past seven in the morning we saw the Island Maitea,called Osnaburg by Captain Wallis, who first discovered it. At noon itbore south-west by west one-quarter west, six miles distant. Our latitude17 degrees 50 minutes south, longitude 212 degrees 24 minutes east.Variation five degrees east. As Captain Wallis and Captain Cook had bothpassed near the south side, I ran along the north side, which isremarkably steep. The island is high and round and not more than threemiles in its greatest extent. The south side, where the declivity fromthe hill is more gradual, is the chief place of residence of the natives;but the north side, from the very summit down to the sea, is so steepthat it can afford no support to the inhabitants. We steered pretty closein to the northward of the east end, where we saw but few habitations: avery neat house on a small eminence, delightfully situated in a grove ofcoconut-trees, particularly attracted our notice. About twenty of thenatives followed us along shore, waving and showing large pieces ofcloth; but the surf on the shore was too high to think of having anycommunication with them. I observed a great number of coconut-trees butdid not see one plantain-tree. There were other trees but of what kind wecould not distinguish: near the east end are two remarkable rocks, and areef runs off to the eastward about half a league.The latitude of Maitea is 17 degrees 53 minutes south; and by ourtimekeeper its longitude is 1 degree 24 minutes east from Point Venus.Variation of the compass 5 degrees 36 minutes east.We continued our course to the westward, and at six in the evening sawOtaheite bearing west three-quarters south; the island Maitea, then insight, bearing east half south, eight leagues distant. As there was greatprobability that we should remain a considerable time at Otaheite, itcould not be expected that the intercourse of my people with the nativesshould be of a very reserved nature: I therefore ordered that everyperson should be examined by the surgeon, and had the satisfaction tolearn from his report that they were all perfectly free from any venerealcomplaint.Sunday 26.On the 26th at four o'clock in the morning, having run twenty-fiveleagues from Maitea, we brought to till daylight, when we saw Point Venusbearing south-west by west, distant about four leagues. As we drew near agreat number of canoes came off to us. Their first enquiries were if wewere tyos, which signifies friends; and whether we came from Pretanie(their pronunciation of Britain) or from Lima: they were no soonersatisfied in this than they crowded on board in vast numbers,notwithstanding our endeavours to prevent it, as we were working the shipin; and in less than ten minutes the deck was so full that I could scarcefind my own people. At nine in the forenoon we were obliged to anchor inthe outer part of Matavai Bay, in thirteen fathoms, being prevented bylight variable winds from placing the ship in a proper berth. In thisstation the west part of One-tree hill bore south by east half east onemile distant.This passage of fifty-two days from Van Diemen's Land may be rated asmoderate sailing. We passed New Zealand with the spring equinox and thewinds, though strong, were at no time violent. To the southward of 40degrees 0 minutes south they were variable; between the latitudes of 40and 33 degrees south the wind kept in the north-west quarter; afterwardstill we got into the trade the winds were variable, mostly from theeastward, but light and inclinable to calms. The ship was 3 degrees 22minutes in longitude to the eastward of the dead reckoning, which thetimekeeper almost invariably proved to be owing to a current giving usmore easting than the log. Our track was as distant from any course offormer ships as I could conveniently make it and, though we made no newdiscoveries, except the small cluster of islands near New Zealand, yet inother parts of the track, as has been noticed, we met with signs of beingin the neighbourhood of land.It may not be unworthy of remark that the whole distance which the shiphad run by the log, in direct and contrary courses, from leaving Englandto our anchoring at Otaheite, was twenty-seven thousand and eighty-sixmiles which, on an average, is at the rate of a hundred and eight mileseach twenty-four hours.CHAPTER 6.Account of an English Ship lately sailed from Otaheite.Death of Omai.Captain Cook's Picture sent on board.Otoo visits the Ship.His Visit returned.Natives well disposed towards us.Account of the Cattle left by Captain Cook.Breadfruit plants promised.Visit to the Earee Rahie.Presents made to the Arreoys.1788. October. Sunday 26.The ship being anchored, our number of visitors continued to increase;but as yet we saw no person that we could recollect to have been of muchconsequence. Some inferior chiefs made me presents of a few hogs and Imade them presents in return. We were supplied with coconuts in greatabundance but breadfruit was scarce.Many enquiries were made after Captain Cook, Sir Joseph Banks, and manyof their former friends. They said a ship had been here from which theyhad learnt that Captain Cook was dead; but the circumstances of his deaththey did not appear to be acquainted with; and I had given particulardirections to my officers and ship's company that they should not bementioned. The ship spoken of, they informed me, stayed at Otaheite onemonth and had been gone four months, by some of their accounts; accordingto others only three months. The captain they called Tonah. I understoodlikewise from them that Lieutenant Watts was in the ship who, having beenhere in the Resolution with Captain Cook, was well known to them. One ofmy first enquiries, as will naturally be imagined, was after our friendOmai; and it was a sensible mortification and disappointment to me tohear that not only Omai, but both the New Zealand boys who had been leftwith him, were dead. Everyone agreed in their information that they dieda natural death. Otoo, who was the chief of Matavai when Captain Cook washere the last time, was absent at another part of the island; they toldme messengers were sent to inform him of our arrival, and that he wasexpected to return soon. There appeared among the natives in generalgreat goodwill towards us, and they seemed to be much rejoiced at ourarrival. This whole day we experienced no instance of dishonesty. We wereso much crowded that I could not undertake to remove to a more properstation without danger of disobliging our visitors by desiring them toleave the ship: this business was therefore deferred till the nextmorning.Monday 27.Early in the morning, before the natives began to flock off to us, weweighed anchor to work farther into the bay, and moored at about aquarter of a mile distance from the shore; Point Venus bearing north 16degrees east; the west part of One-tree hill south-west by south; and thepoint of the reef north 37 degrees west; the ship lying in seven fathomswater.Several chiefs now came on board and expressed great pleasure at seeingme. Among these were Otow, the father of Otoo, and Oreepyah, his brother;also another chief of Matavai called Poeeno: and to these men I madepresents. Two messengers likewise arrived from Otoo to acquaint me of hisbeing on his way to the ship; each of whom brought me as a present fromOtoo a small pig and a young plantain-tree as a token of friendship. Theship was now plentifully supplied with provisions; every person having asmuch as he could consume.As soon as the ship was secured I went on shore with the chief Poeeno,and accompanied by a multitude of the natives. He conducted me to theplace where we had fixed our tents in 1777 and desired that I would nowappropriate the spot to the same use. We then went across the beach andthrough a walk delightfully shaded with breadfruit trees to his ownhouse. Here we found two women at work staining a piece of cloth red.These I found were his wife and her sister. They desired me to sit downon a mat which was spread for the purpose, and with great kindnessoffered me refreshments. I received the congratulations of severalstrangers who came to us and behaved with great decorum and attention.The people however thronged about the house in such numbers that I wasmuch incommoded by the heat, which being observed they immediately drewback. Among the crowd I saw a man who had lost his arm just above theelbow; the stump was well covered and the cure seemed as perfect as couldbe expected from the greatest professional skill.I made enquiries about the cattle that had been left here by CaptainCook, but the accounts I received were very unfavourable and so variousthat for the present I shall forebear speaking of them. After stayingabout an hour I got up to take leave, when the women in a very obligingmanner came to me with a mat and a piece of their finest cloth, whichthey put on me after the Otaheite fashion. When I was thus dressed theyeach of them took one of my hands, and accompanied me to the waterside,and at parting promised that they would soon return my visit.In this walk I had the satisfaction to see that the island had receivedsome benefit from our former visits. Two shaddocks were brought to me, afruit which they had not, till we introduced it. And among the articleswhich they brought off to the ship and offered for sale were capsicums,pumpkins, and two young goats.On my return to the ship I found that a small disturbance had beenoccasioned by one of the natives making an attempt to steal a tin pot;which, on being known to Oreepyah, he flew into a violent rage, and itwas with some difficulty that the thief escaped with his life. He droveall his countrymen out of the ship; and when he saw me he desired if atany time I found a thief that I would order him to be tied up andpunished with a severe flogging.This forenoon a man came on board with Captain Cook's picture which hadbeen drawn by Mr. Webber in 1777 and left with Otoo. It was brought to meto be repaired. The frame was broken but the picture no way damagedexcept a little in the background. They called it Toote (which has alwaysbeen their manner of pronouncing Captain Cook's name) Earee no Otaheite,chief of Otaheite. They said Toote had desired Otoo, whenever any Englishship came, to show the picture, and it would be acknowledged as a tokenof friendship. The youngest brother of Otoo, named Whydooah, visited methis afternoon: he appeared stupefied with drinking ava. At sunset allour male visitors left the ship.Tuesday 28.The next morning early I received a message from Otoo to inform me of hisarrival and requesting that I would send a boat for him; which Iimmediately did with an officer (Mr. Christian) to conduct him on board.He came with numerous attendants and expressed much satisfaction at ourmeeting. After introducing his wife to me we joined noses, the customarymanner of saluting, and to perpetuate our friendship he desired we shouldexchange names. I was surprised to find that instead of Otoo, the name bywhich he formerly went, he was now called Tinah. The name of Otoo, withthe title of Earee Rahie, I was informed had devolved to his eldest sonwho was yet a minor, as is the custom of the country. The name of Tinah'swife was Iddeah: with her was a woman dressed with a large quantity ofcloth in the form of a hoop, which was taken off and presented to me witha large hog and some breadfruit. I then took my visitors into the cabinand after a short time produced my presents in return. The present I madeto Tinah (by which name I shall hereafter call him) consisted ofhatchets, small adzes, files, gimblets, saws, looking-glasses, redfeathers, and two shirts. To Iddeah I gave earrings, necklaces, andbeads; but she expressed a desire also for iron, and therefore I made thesame assortment for her as I had for the husband. Much conversation tookplace among them on the value of the different articles and they appearedextremely satisfied, so that they determined to spend the day with me andrequested I would show them all over the ship, and particularly the cabinwhere I slept. This though I was not fond of doing I indulged them in;and the consequence was as I had apprehended that they took a fancy to somany things that they got from me nearly as much more as I had beforegiven them. Afterwards Tinah desired me to fire some of the great guns:this I likewise complied with and, as the shot fell into the sea at agreat distance, all the natives expressed their surprise by loud shoutsand acclamations.I had a large company at dinner; for besides Tinah and his wife there wasOtow, the father of Tinah, Oreepyah, and Whydooah, two of his brothers,Poeeno, and several other chiefs. Tinah is a very large man, much abovethe common stature, being not less than six feet four inches in heightand proportionably stout: his age about thirty-five. His wife (Iddeah) Ijudged to be about twenty-four years of age: she is likewise much abovethe common size of the women at Otaheite and has a very animated andintelligent countenance. Whydooah, the younger brother of Tinah, washighly spoken of as a warrior but had the character of being the greatestdrunkard in the country; and indeed to judge from the withered appearanceof his skin he must have used the pernicious drink called ava to greatexcess. Tinah was fed by one of his attendants who sat by him for thatpurpose, this being a particular custom among some of the superiorchiefs; and I must do him the justice to say he kept his attendantconstantly employed: there was indeed little reason to complain of wantof appetite in any of my guests. As the women are not allowed to eat inpresence of the men Iddeah dined with some of her companions about anhour afterwards in private, except that her husband Tinah favoured themwith his company and seemed to have entirely forgotten that he hadalready dined.Provisions were brought off to the ship in the greatest plenty and, toprevent as much as possible anything which might occasion disputes, Idesired Mr. Peckover, the gunner, to undertake the management of ourtraffic with the natives. Some of the hogs brought today weighed 200pounds and we purchased several for salting. Goats were likewise broughtoff for sale, and I bought a she-goat and kid for less than would havepurchased a small hog. Our friends here expressed much disappointmentthat there was no portrait-painter on board; Tinah in particular, whowished to have had pictures of his father and family.An intimacy between the natives and our people was already so generalthat there was scarce a man in the ship who had not his tyo or friend.Tinah continued with me the whole afternoon, in the course of which heate four times of roast pork besides his dinner. When he left the ship herequested I would keep for him all the presents I had given to him as hehad not at Matavai a place sufficiently safe to secure them from beingstolen; I therefore showed him a locker in my cabin for his use and gavehim a key to it. This is perhaps not so much a proof of his want of poweras of the estimation in which they hold European commodities and whichmakes more than the common means of security requisite to prevent theft.I had sent Nelson and his assistant to look for plants, and it was nosmall pleasure to me to find by their report that according toappearances the object of my mission would probably be accomplished withease. I had given directions to everyone on board not to make known tothe islanders the purpose of our coming lest it might enhance the valueof the breadfruit plants, or occasion other difficulties. Perhaps so muchcaution was not necessary but at all events I wished to reserve to myselfthe time and manner of communication. Nelson met with two fineshaddock-trees which he had planted in 1777: they were full of fruit butnot ripe.Wednesday 29.In the morning I returned Tinah's visit for I found he expected it. Hewas in a small shed about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of Matavaipoint with his wife and three children, not their own but who they saidwere relations. In my walk I had picked up a numerous attendance foreveryone I met followed me; so that I had collected such a crowd that theheat was scarce bearable, everyone endeavouring to get a look to satisfytheir curiosity: they however carefully avoided pressing against me, andwelcomed me with cheerful countenances and great good nature.I made Tinah understand that my visit was particularly to him, and gavehim a second present, equal to the first, which he received with greatpleasure; and to the people of consequence that were about him I alsopresented some article or other. There were great numbers of childrenand, as I took notice of the little ones that were in arms and gave thembeads, both small and great, but with much drollery and good humour,endeavoured to benefit by the occasion. Boys of ten and twelve years oldwere caught up in arms and brought to me, which created much laughter; sothat in a short time I got rid of all I had brought on shore.In my return I called on Poeeno, and an elderly chief, a relation of his,called Moannah, the principal men of this district and with whom I judgedit my interest to be on good terms. I gave them several valuable articlesand, as the situation here was eligible for a garden, I planted melon,cucumber, and salad-seeds. I told them many other things should be sownfor their use; and they appeared much pleased when they understood Iintended to plant such things as would grow to be trees and producefruit. I saw large patches of tobacco growing without culture and manypumpkin vines. The breadfruit trees and coconut trees at this time werefull of fruit.I went on board to dinner and Moannah accompanied me. In the afternoon Ireturned to Poeeno's with some additional seeds to improve the littlegarden I had begun to make in the forenoon. While I was giving directionsI received a message from Tinah inviting me to come to him at his brotherOreepyah's house, which was near the beach. At this place I found a greatnumber of people collected who, on my appearance, immediately made wayfor me to sit down by Tinah. The crowd being ordered to draw back, apiece of cloth about two yards wide and forty-one yards in length wasspread on the ground; and another piece of cloth was brought by Oreepyah,which he put over my shoulders and round my waist in the manner thechiefs are clothed. Two large hogs, weighing each above two hundredpounds, and a quantity of baked breadfruit and coconuts were then laidbefore me as a present, and I was desired to walk from one end of thecloth spread on the ground to the other, in the course of which Tyo andEhoah* were repeated with loud acclamations. This ceremony being endedTinah desired I would send the things on board, which completely loadedthe boat; we therefore waited till she came back and then I took them onboard with me; for I knew they expected some return. The present which Imade on this occasion was equal to any that I had made before; but Idiscovered that Tinah was not the sole proprietor of what he had given tome for the present I gave was divided among those who, I guessed, hadcontributed to support his dignity; among whom were Moannah, Poeenah, andOreepyah; Tinah however kept the greatest part of what I had given andeveryone seemed satisfied with the proportion he allotted them.(*Footnote. Tyo and Ehoah are words of the same signification, i.e.friend.)The Otaheite breed of hogs seems to be supplanted by the European.Originally they were of the China sort, short and very thick-necked; butthe superior size of the European have made them encourage our breed.Thursday 30.At break of day Tinah and his wife came again to the ship and, as theirattendants were numerous, I provided a breakfast for them of broiled androasted pork, which they preferred to tea. Our arrival being known allover the island, we had this day a great number of strangers on board whocame from the most remote parts, and in the forenoon some hooks andthimbles were cut out from the blocks. This induced me to order all thenatives out of the ship except the chiefs and their attendants. Inexecuting these orders a daring fellow attacked the sentinel but escapedamong the crowd. Everyone knew the consequence of offending the sentineland were exceedingly alarmed at the appearance of anger I thoughtnecessary to assume.Among those who visited us today were two chiefs of great consequence,Marremarre and his son Poohaitaiah Otee, Earees of the districts ofItteeah and Attahooroo. Otee was fed at dinner in the same manner asTinah. It was evident that the attention which I showed to these chiefsseemed to give uneasiness to Tinah. At sunset my visitors took leave andwere carried on shore by one of the ship's boats, which has always beenregarded as a mark of distinction, and on that account preferred by themto going in their own canoes. At their request a race was rowed betweenour five-oared cutter and one of their double canoes with four paddles.Great exertions were used on both sides but the cutter first reached theshore. In their return to the ship Oreepyah stopped them till a largepiece of cloth that he had sent for was brought; which he tied to theboat-hook and desired should be carried off as a trophy of their victory.Friday 31.The next morning at sunrise Moannah came on board with a message fromTinah to acquaint me that he was mattow (afraid to see me) till he hadrecovered some things that had been stolen from the ship and which he hadsent after. I knew there was something wrong, as no canoes came off to usand, on looking about, we found the buoy of the best bower anchor hadbeen taken away, I imagine for the sake of some iron hoops that were onit. That this might not create any coolness I sent a boat to Tinah toinvite him and his friends to come on board; which they immediately didand were no longer under any apprehensions. I had made an appointmentwith Oreepyah for him to go with me to Oparre this morning; but theaccident just mentioned caused him to break his engagement, he havinggone, I was informed, in search of what had been stolen.Oparre is the district next to the westward of Matavai. One of my reasonsfor going to Oparre was to see if Nelson would be able to procure plantsthere; but I gave the credit of my visit to young Otoo, the son of Tinah,who was the Earee Rahie, and lived with the rest of Tinah's children atOparre. I prepared a magnificent present for this youth, who wasrepresented to me as the person of the greatest consequence, or rather ofthe highest rank, in the island. At noon I left the ship, accompanied byTinah, his wife Iddeah, and Poeeno. Moannah was to have been of the partybut he insisted on remaining in the ship to prevent his countrymen fromattempting to steal anything.After half an hour's sailing we arrived at Oparre. During this time Tinahgave me a more circumstantial account of the cattle and sheep that hadbeen left with him: he related that, after five years from the time ofCaptain Cook's departure (counting 63 moons) the people of the IslandEimeo joined with those of Attahooroo, a district of Otaheite, and made adescent on Oparre: that after some resistance by which many men werekilled Tinah and his people fled to the mountains, leaving all theirproperty to the mercy of the victorious party who destroyed almosteverything which they found not convenient to take away with them. Someof the cattle were killed and eaten but the greater part were taken toEimeo. The cows he said had produced eight calves and the ewes ten youngones. The ducks, among which they classed the geese, had greatlyincreased; but the turkeys and peacocks, whatever was the cause, had notbred. It seemed to give Tinah great pleasure to observe how much I wasconcerned for the destruction of so many useful animals; but the cause ofhis satisfaction, I found, did not proceed from any expectation that Ishould replace them, but from the belief that I would take vengeance onthe people who had deprived him of them; for with respect to the loss ofthe cattle he appeared so unconcerned and indifferent that I was veryangry with him. There is however sufficient excuse for his resentmentagainst the people of Eimeo; for the large extensive houses which we hadseen in this part of Otaheite in the year 1777 were all destroyed, and atpresent they had no other habitations than light sheds which might betaken by the four corners and removed by four men: and of the many largecanoes which they then had not more than three remained. Tinah,understanding from my conversation that I intended visiting some of theother islands in this neighbourhood, very earnestly desired I would notthink of leaving Matavai. "Here," said he, "you shall be suppliedplentifully with everything you want. All here are your friends andfriends of King George: if you go to the other islands you will haveeverything stolen from you." I replied that, on account of their goodwilland from a desire to serve him and his country, King George had sent outthose valuable presents to him; "and will not you, Tinah, send somethingto King George in return?" "Yes," he said, "I will send him anything Ihave;" and then began to enumerate the different articles in his power,among which he mentioned the breadfruit. This was the exact point towhich I wished to bring the conversation and, seizing an opportunitywhich had every appearance of being undesigned and accidental, I told himthe breadfruit trees were what King George would like; upon which hepromised me a great many should be put on board, and seemed muchdelighted to find it so easily in his power to send anything that wouldbe well received by King George.On landing at Oparre an immense crowd of natives as usual immediatelythronged about us. I enquired for Oreepyah, whom I expected to have metme here, but he was not yet returned from his search after the thieves;we therefore went under a shed of his to wait for him, and in about aquarter of an hour he joined us, bringing with him an iron scraper andone of the hoops of the buoy. I thanked him for the trouble which he hadtaken, and assured him that I was perfectly satisfied, for he stillseemed apprehensive of my displeasure.We took leave for a short time of Oreepyah and I proceeded with Tinah tomake my visit to the young Otoo, the Earee Rahie. When we had walkedabout five minutes Tinah stopped and informed me that no person could bepermitted to see his son, who was covered above the shoulders. He thentook off his upper garments and requested I would do the same. I repliedthat I had no objection to go as I would to my own king, who was thegreatest in all the world and, pulling off my hat, he threw a piece ofcloth round my shoulders and we went on. About a quarter of a milefarther towards the hills, through a delightful shade of breadfruittrees, we stopped at the side of a small serpentine river: here I was inview of a house on the other side at about fifty yards distance. Fromthis house the young king was brought out on a man's shoulders, clothedin a piece of fine white cloth, and I was desired by Tinah to salute himby the name of Too Earee Rahie. The present which I had prepared wasdivided into three parts, and two other children made their appearance inthe same manner. The first present I gave to a messenger who attended forthat purpose; and I was instructed by Tinah to say that it was for theEaree Rahie; that I was his friend; that I hated thieves; and that I camefrom Britannia. The second present was sent in the same manner, with asimilar message, to one of the other children and likewise the third.As I could not see the Earee Rahie distinctly I desired to be permittedto go over the river to him; but this, it seems, could not be compliedwith: therefore after seeing the presents delivered I returned with Tinahtowards Oreepyah's house. I was informed that Tinah had four children byhis wife Iddeah. Otoo, or Too, the Earee Rahie, appeared to be about sixyears old: the second is a girl named Terrenah Oroah: the third a boy,Terreetappanooai; and a fourth, an infant girl, whom I did not see, namedTahamydooah.When we came to the place where we had first stopped Tinah took the clothfrom my shoulders and desired me to put my hat on; I expressed a desireto see more of the place and he took me back by a different way. Onpassing a trunk of a tree, rudely carved, I was desired again to pull myhat off, and all uncovered their shoulders. This I discovered to benothing more than the boundary of the king's land; on which whoever settheir feet uncovered themselves out of respect.We stopped at a house belonging to Tinah where I was treated with aconcert of one drum and three flutes with singing by four men. I madesome presents to the performers and we removed to Oreepyah's house where,after paying my compliments to him, which I found was expected, Tinahmade me a present of a large hog and some coconuts. He then introduced anuncle of his called Mowworoah, a very old man much tattooed and almostblind. To this chief I made a present and soon after I embarked withTinah, Oreepyah, their wives, and Poeeno. A vast number of people werecollected on the beach to see us depart and as soon as the boat had putoff Tinah desired me to fire my pocket pistol, the poopooe ete ete, as hecalled it: the report seemed to electrify the whole crowd but, finding noharm done, they gave great shouts of approbation.Nelson, who accompanied me in this expedition, had but little opportunityto search after plants, the natives having crowded so much about him: hesaw enough however to assure him that they were to be procured here asplentifully as at Matavai.In our passage to the ship, which we rowed in one hour, nothing butBritannie was enquired after and of the number of ships and guns. When Itold them we had ships of 100 guns they could not believe it till I drewone on paper: they then asked me if it was not as big as Tarrah, which isa high projecting headland halfway between Matavai and Oparre, called byus One-tree Hill. Tinah much wished that one of these large ships shouldbe sent to Otaheite and that myself should come in her, and bring him anumber of things that he wanted; among which he particularly desired bedsand high-backed elbow chairs might not be forgotten: a request perfectlyaccording with the indolent character of Tinah.November. Saturday 1.As we had occasion to fix a tent on Point Venus this morning we moved theship nearer to it and moored again in six fathoms, the point bearingnorth-north-east.Tinah and several other chiefs dined on board with me. After dinner Iwent on shore with Tinah and made a visit to his father Otow. I likewisewent to the garden which I had made near Poeeno's house and foundeverything had been taken care of. After this I was invited to anentertainment called Heiva, which Tinah had ordered and which consistedof singing and dancing by three men and a young girl. When thisperformance was finished I returned to the ship.Sunday 2.At daylight I sent Mr. Christian with a party to erect our tent and soonafter followed myself with Tinah, Moannah, and Poeeno. With their consentI fixed a boundary, within which the natives were not to enter withoutleave and the chiefs cautioned them against it.The principal use of the tents on shore was for a lodgment for theplants; and I had now, instead of appearing to receive a favour, broughtthe chiefs to believe that I was doing them a kindness in carrying theplants as a present from them to the Earee Rahie no Britanee. The partyat the tent consisted of nine persons, including Nelson and hisassistant.Tinah dined with me on board and was today my only visitor: neverthelessthe ceremony of being fed he so scrupulously observed that, even afterall the attendants were sent away and we were left by ourselves, I wasobliged to lift the wine to his mouth. The wives of the Earees aresometimes subject to this restriction after the birth of a child but arereleased after a certain time on performing a ceremony called Oammo.After dinner Tinah invited me to accompany him with a present ofprovisions to a party of the Arreoys, a society described in the accountsof the former voyages: in this ceremony he made me the principal person.Our way to the place where the offering was to be made was by the side ofa river along the banks of which I had always walked before this time;but on the present occasion a canoe was provided for me and dragged byeight men. On arriving at the landing-place I saw a large quantity ofbreadfruit with some hogs ready dressed and a quantity of cloth. At aboutforty yards distant sat a man who, I was informed, was a principalArreoy. A lane being made by the crowd he was addressed by one of Tinah'speople, standing on the canoe, in a speech composed of short sentenceswhich lasted about a quarter of an hour. During this a piece of cloth wasproduced, one end of which I was desired to hold, and five men, one witha sucking pig and the others having each a basket of breadfruit, preparedto follow me. In this order we advanced to the Arreoy and laid the wholedown before him. I then spoke several sentences dictated to me by Tinah,the meaning of which I did not understand and, my pronunciation not beingvery exact, caused a great deal of mirth. This speech being finished Iwas shown another Arreoy, who had come from Ulietea, and to him likewiseI was required to deliver an oration. Tinah understanding from me that Ihad children in my own country he desired me to make one more offering ontheir account. There still remained three baskets of breadfruit, a smallpig, and another piece of cloth: with these, assisted as before, I madethe offering in favour of my children to the man whom I had firstaddressed. He made no reply to all my fine speeches but sat with greatgravity and received everything as a matter of right and not of courtesy.All that I could make out of this strange ceremony was that the Arreoysare highly respected and that the society is chiefly composed of mendistinguished by their valour or some other merit, and that great trustand confidence is reposed in them; but I could not comprehend what thishad to do with my children or why it should be imagined that an offeringmade on their account to a society of men who destroy all their childrenshould be propitious. I learnt from Tinah, in talking about his children,that his first-born child was killed as soon as it came into the world,he being then an Arreoy; but before his second child was born he quittedthe society. The Arreoys are allowed great latitude in their amoursexcept in times of danger. Then as they are almost all fighting men (tatatoa) they are restricted that they may not weaken or enervate themselves.These ceremonies being ended I returned to the ship.Such of the natives as I conversed with about the institution of soextraordinary a society as the Arreoy asserted that it was necessary toprevent an overpopulation. Worrow worrow no te mydidde, worrow worrow tetata. We have too many children and too many men was their constantexcuse. Yet it does not appear that they are apprehensive of too great anincrease of the lower class of people, none of them being ever admittedinto the Arreoy society. The most remarkable instance related to me ofthe barbarity of this institution was of Teppahoo, the Earee of thedistrict of Tettaha, and his wife, Tetteehowdeeah, who is sister to Otowand considered as a person of the first consequence. I was told that theyhave had eight children, every one of which was destroyed as soon asborn. That any human beings were ever so devoid of natural affection asnot to wish to preserve alive one of so many children is not credible. Itis more reasonable to conclude that the death of these infants was not anact of choice in the parents; but that they were sacrificed in compliancewith some barbarous superstition with which we are unacquainted. Whatstrengthens this conjecture is that they have adopted a nephew as theirheir, of whom they are excessively fond.In countries so limited as the islands in the South Seas, the natives ofwhich, before they were discovered by European navigators, probably hadnot an idea of the existence of other lands, it is not unnatural that anincreasing population should occasion apprehensions of universaldistress. Orders of celibacy which have proved so prejudicial in othercountries might perhaps in this have been beneficial; so far at least asto have answered their purpose by means not criminal. The number ofinhabitants at Otaheite have been estimated at above one hundredthousand. The island however is not cultivated to the greatest advantage:yet were they continually to improve in husbandry their improvement couldnot for a length of time keep pace with an unlimited population.An idea here presents itself which, however fanciful it may appear atfirst sight, seems to merit some attention: While we see among theseislands so great a waste of the human species that numbers are born onlyto die, and at the same time a large continent so near to them as NewHolland, in which there is so great a waste of land uncultivated andalmost destitute of inhabitants, it naturally occurs how greatly the twocountries might be made to benefit each other, and gives occasion toregret that the islanders are not instructed in the means of emigratingto New Holland, which seems as if designed by nature to serve as anasylum for the superflux of inhabitants in the islands. Such a plan ofemigration, if rendered practicable to them, might not only be the meansof abolishing the horrid custom of destroying children as it would removethe plea of necessity but might lead to other important purposes. A greatcontinent would be converted from a desert to a populous country; anumber of our fellow-creatures would be saved; the inhabitants of theislands would become more civilised; and it is not improbable but thatour colonies in New Holland would derive so much benefit as to more thanrepay any trouble of expense that might be incurred in endeavouring topromote so humane a plan.The latter however is a remote consideration for the intertropical partsof New Holland are those most suited to the habits and manner of livingof the islanders; and likewise the soil and climate are the best adaptedto their modes of agriculture. Man placed by his Creator in the warmclimates perhaps would never emigrate into the colder unless under thetyrannous influence of necessity; and ages might elapse before the newinhabitants would spread to our settlers though they are but barelywithin the limits of frost, that great cause of nine-tenths of thenecessities of Europeans. Nevertheless besides forwarding the purposes ofhumanity and general convenience in bringing a people without land to aland without people the benefit of a mutual intercourse with aneighbouring and friendly colony would in itself be no inconsiderableadvantage.Among people so free from ostentation as the Otaheiteans, and whosemanners are so simple and natural, the strictness with which thepunctilios of rank are observed is surprising. I know not if any action,however meritorious, can elevate a man above the class in which he wasborn unless he were to acquire sufficient power to confer dignity onhimself. If any woman of the inferior classes has a child by an Earee itis not suffered to live. Perhaps the offspring of Teppahoo andTetteehowdeeah were destined to satisfy some cruel adjustment of rank andprecedency.CHAPTER 7.A theft committed.Deception of the painted Head.Conversation with a Priest.A Wrestling Match.Reports of the Natives concerning other Islands.Some Account of Omai.1788. November. Monday 3.The trade for provisions I directed to be carried on at the tent by Mr.Peckover the gunner. Moannah likewise resided there as a guard over hiscountrymen; but though it appeared to be the wish of all the chiefs thatwe should remain unmolested it was not possible entirely to prevent themfrom pilfering.My table at dinner was generally crowded. Tinah, Oreepyah, Poeeno, andMoannah, were my regular guests and I was seldom without some chiefs fromother districts. Almost every individual of any consequence has severalnames which makes it frequently perplexing when the same person is spokenof to know who is meant. Every chief has perhaps a dozen or more names inthe course of thirty years; so that the person who has been spoken of byone visitor will not perhaps be known to another unless othercircumstances lead to a discovery. The father of Tinah, at this timecalled Otow, was known in 1769 by the name of Whappai.I showed Tinah the preparations I was making to take on board thebreadfruit plants which pleased him exceedingly, but he did not forget toremind me that when the next ship came out he hoped King George wouldsend him large axes, files, saws, cloth of all kinds, hats, chairs, andbedsteads, with arms, ammunition, and in short everything he could thinkof mentioning.This afternoon the gudgeon of the rudder belonging to the large cutterwas drawn out and stolen without being perceived by the man that wasstationed to take care of her. Several petty thefts having been committedby the natives, mostly owing to the negligence of our own people and, asthese kind of accidents generally created alarm and had a tendency tointerrupt the good terms on which we were with the chiefs, I thought itwould have a good effect to punish the boat-keeper in their presence,many of them happening to be then on board; and accordingly I ordered hima dozen lashes. Tinah with several of the chiefs attended the punishmentand interceded very earnestly to get it mitigated: the women showed greatsympathy and that degree of feeling which characterises the amiable partof their sex.The natives brought off today two different kinds of roots that grow likeyams: one they call Ettee, which is a sweet root, common also to theFriendly Islands, and may be eaten as a sweetmeat: the other they callAppay, a root like the Tyah or Eddie in the West Indies. A fruit calledAyyah, which is the jambo of Batavia, was likewise brought off to us:they are as large as middle-sized apples, very juicy and refreshing, andmay be eaten in large quantities. Also some Avees, which are the realOtaheite apple; but they were not yet in season. These are a delicioushigh-flavoured fruit and before they are ripe answer the culinarypurposes of our apples.Tuesday 4.A chief called Tootaha, who came from the island Ulietea, was introducedto me today by Tinah as one of his particular friends. I was told that hewas a priest and a person of great knowledge. I desired Tinah to takewhat he thought proper as a present for him; and I must do Tinah thejustice to say he was more sparing than I should have been. I likewisereceived a visit today from Oedidee, the man who had been at sea withCaptain Cook in 1773 and 1774, as related in the account of that voyage.He still retained some of the English words which he had learnt in thatexpedition.Wednesday 5.The weather variable with lightning and frequent showers of rain. Windeast-north-east.This was the first day of our beginning to take up plants: we had muchpleasure in collecting them for the natives offered their assistance andperfectly understood the method of taking them up and pruning them.The crowd of natives was not so great as hitherto it had been: thecuriosity of strangers was satisfied and, as the weather began to beunsettled and rainy, they had almost all returned to their homes so thatonly the people of Matavai and Oparre remained with us, except a fewchiefs from other islands: our supplies however were abundant and what Iconsidered as no small addition to our comforts, we ceased to beincommoded when on shore by the natives following us, and could take ourwalks almost unnoticed. In any house that we wished to enter we alwaysexperienced a kind reception and without officiousness. The Otaheiteanshave the most perfect easiness of manners, equally free from forwardnessand formality. When they offer refreshments if they are not accepted theydo not think of offering them the second time; for they have not theleast idea of that ceremonious kind of refusal which expects a secondinvitation. In like manner at taking leave we were never troubled withsolicitations to prolong our visit, but went without ceremony exceptmaking use of a farewell expression at parting. Another advantage, seldomfound in warm countries, was, in this part of Otaheite being free frommosquitoes, though at particular times of the year the inhabitants arepestered with great numbers of flies.Moannah continued our constant friend at the tent and with Tinah and allhis friends dined with me every day.The ship's barber had brought with him from London a painted head such asthe hair-dressers have in their shops to show the different fashions ofdressing hair; and it being made with regular features and well-coloured,I desired him to dress it, which he did with much neatness, and with astick and a quantity of cloth he formed a body. It was then reported tothe natives that we had an Englishwoman on board and the quarter-deck wascleared of the crowd that she might make her appearance. Being handed upthe ladder and carried to the after-part of the deck there was a generalshout of "Huaheine no Brittane myty." Huaheine signifies woman and mytygood. Many of them thought it was living and asked if it was my wife. Oneold woman ran with presents of cloth and breadfruit and laid them at herfeet; at last they found out the cheat; but continued all delighted withit, except the old lady who felt herself mortified and took back herpresents for which she was laughed at exceedingly. Tinah and all thechiefs enjoyed the joke and, after making many enquiries about theBritish women, they strictly enjoined me when I came again to bring aship full of them.Some very fine sugarcane was brought to me; each of the pieces was sixinches round. I had before told Tinah that our sugar was made of it andhe was very desirous to discover the means; for they were so fond of ourloaf sugar that a present to any chief would have been incomplete withouta piece of it. Another article in great estimation and likewise expectedto make part of a present was scissors, which they made use of to keeptheir beards in order.By this time Nelson had, with assistance from the ship, completed a largegarden near the tents in which were sown seeds of different kinds that wehad collected at the Cape of Good Hope. I likewise distributedfruit-stones and almonds for planting among the chiefs, who I hope willendeavour to make them succeed and, as they are very fond ofsweet-smelling flowers with which the women delight to ornamentthemselves, I gave them some rose-seed.Thursday 6.We had very variable weather, much rain, and some westerly winds; so thata considerable swell ran into the bay and a number of spotted white andblack porpoises made their appearance.I had the mortification to see that our garden-ground had been much trodover; and what was worse the chiefs appeared but little concerned at it.To this kind of carelessness and indifference I attribute the miscarriageof many of the plants left here by Captain Cook. I had now in aflourishing state two orange plants, some vines, a fig-tree, and twopineapple plants, which I gave to Poeeno whose residence is a placefavourable for their growth.We got on successfully with our plants, having a hundred potted at thetent and in a fair way of doing well. The cabin also was completed andready to receive them on board.I have before remarked that my friend Tinah was rather of a selfishdisposition and this afternoon he showed a stronger instance of it than Iwas witness to at any time before or after. His brother Oreepyah sent onboard to me a present of a large hog and a quantity of breadfruit: butthese kind of presents are much more expensive than purchasing at themarket. Soon after Oreepyah himself came on board. Tinah was with me atthe time and whispered me to tell Oreepyah not to bring any more hogs orfruit and to take those back which he had sent. This advice as may besupposed did not produce the effect intended. Oreepyah appears to be aman of great spirit, and is highly respected by his countrymen. Amongother visitors today was one of the men who had been to Lima in 1776.Saturday 8.Our plants had now increased to 252: as they were all kept on shore atthe tent I augmented the guard there, though from the general conduct ofthe natives there did not appear the least occasion for so much caution.While I was at dinner Tinah desired I would permit a man to come downinto the cabin whom he called his Taowah or priest; for I was obliged tokeep a sentinel at the hatchway to prevent being incommoded at my mealswith too much company; a restriction which pleased the chiefs who alwaysasked leave for any particular person to be admitted of whom they wishedme to take notice. The company of the priest brought on a religiousconversation. He said their great God was called Oro; and that they hadmany others of less consequence. He asked me if I had a God? if he had ason? and who was his wife? I told them he had a son but no wife. Who washis father and mother? was the next question. I said he never had fatheror mother; at this they laughed exceedingly. You have a God then whonever had a father or mother and has a child without a wife! Many otherquestions were asked which my little knowledge of the language did notenable me to answer.The weather was now fine again and a great number of people were comefrom other parts of the island. Tinah informed me that there was to be aheiva and a wrestling-match on shore, and that the performers waited forour attendance; we therefore set off with several of our friends and,about a quarter of a mile from the tents, we found a great concourse ofpeople formed into a ring. As soon as we were seated a dancing heivabegan, which was performed by two girls and four men: this lasted half anhour and consisted of wanton gestures and motions such as have beendescribed in the account of former voyages. When the dance ended Tinahordered a long piece of cloth to be brought; his wife Iddeah and myselfwere desired to hold the two first corners and, the remaining part beingsupported by many others, we carried it to the performers and gave itthem. Several other chiefs made a like present or payment. The performerswere strollers that travelled about the country as in Europe.After this the wrestling began and the place soon became a scene of riotand confusion. A party of the Arreoys also began to exercise a privilege,which it seems they are allowed, of taking from the women such of theirclothes as they thought worth it; so that some of them were left littlebetter than naked. One young woman who was attacked opposed them with allher strength and held fast her cloth, though they almost dragged heralong the ground. Observing that I took notice of her she held out herhand and begged my assistance; and at my request she escaped beingpillaged.Soon after a ring was again made but the wrestlers were so numerouswithin it that it was impossible to restore order. In the challenges theylay one hand upon their breast and, on the bending of the arm at theelbow, with the other hand they strike a very smart blow which, as thehand is kept hollow, creates a sound that may be heard at a considerabledistance; and this they do so frequently and with such force that theflesh becomes exceedingly bruised and, the skin breaking, bleedsconsiderably. At this time the sound from so many resembled that of anumber of people in a wood felling trees. This is the general challenge;but when any two combatants agree to a trial they present their handsforward, joining them only by the extremities of the fingers. They beginby watching to take an advantage; at length they close, seize each otherby the hair and are most commonly parted before either receives a fall.Only one couple performed anything like the part of good wrestlers; andas they were an equal match this conflict lasted longer than any of theothers; but they also were parted.Iddeah was the general umpire and she managed with so much address as toprevent any quarrelling, and there was no murmuring at her decisions. Asher person was large she was very conspicuous in the circle. Tinah tookno part in the management. Upon the whole this performance gave me abetter opinion of their strength than of their skill or dexterity.Tuesday 11.For some time past Tinah had talked of going to the island of Tethuroawhich lies eight or ten leagues north from Otaheite to fetch his mother;but I found I had only half understood him; for this morning he enquiredwhen we were to sail there in the ship: however he seemed to feel nogreat disappointment at my not complying with his wish. Tethuroa heinformed me is the property of his family. He likewise spoke to me aboutan island called Rooopow, the situation of which he described to be tothe eastward of Otaheite four or five days sail, and that there werelarge animals upon it with eight legs. The truth of this account he verystrenuously insisted upon and wished me to go thither with him. I was ata loss to know whether or not Tinah himself gave credit to this whimsicaland fabulous account; for though they have credulity sufficient tobelieve anything, however improbable, they are at the same time so muchaddicted to that species of wit which we call humbug that it isfrequently difficult to discover whether they are in jest or earnest.Their ideas of geography are very simple: they believe the world to be afixed plane of great extent; and that the sun, moon, and stars are all inmotion round it. I have been frequently asked by them if I have not beenas far as the sun and moon; for they think we are such great travellersthat scarce any undertaking is beyond our ability.Another island called Tappuhoi, situated likewise to the eastward, wasdescribed to me by Tinah, the inhabitants of which were said to be allwarriors, and that the people of Otaheite did not dare to go there. Hetold me that very lately a canoe from Tappuhoi was at the island Maitea;that as soon as they landed they began to fight with the people of Maiteawho killed them all except a young lad and a woman who have since been atOtaheite. I saw the boy but could get no information from him. It is mostprobable that this unfortunate visit of the canoe from Tappuhoi was notdesigned but occasioned by adverse winds which forced them so far fromtheir own island, and that the people of Maitea began the attack, takingadvantage of their superior numbers, on account of some former quarrel.Thursday 13.I had a large company to dine with me today. Some of my constant visitorshad observed that we always drank His Majesty's health as soon as thecloth was removed; but they were by this time become so fond of wine thatthey would frequently remind me of the health in the middle of dinner bycalling out King George Earee no Brittannee; and would banter me if theglass was not filled to the brim. Nothing could exceed the mirth andjollity of these people when they met on board.I was assured by Oediddee and several others that the vines planted atthe island Huaheine by Captain Cook had succeeded and bore fruit; andthat some of the other plants, both at Huaheine and at Oaitepeha, adistrict on the south-east part of Otaheite, had been preserved and werein a thriving state. I was likewise informed that there was a bull and acow alive at Otaheite but on different parts of the island, the former ata place called Itteah, the latter at the district of Tettaha. All therest were taken away or destroyed by the people of Eimeo. As Tettaha wasat no great distance I determined to go thither myself the firstopportunity, and make enquiries in hopes that the breed might still bepreserved.I had much discourse with my guests about Omai: they confirmed to me thathe died about thirty months after Captain Cook left the islands. Soonafter Captain Cook's departure from Huaheine there were some disputesbetween the people of that island and those of Ulietea in which also thenatives of Bolabola took a part. Omai, who was become of consequence fromthe possessing three or four muskets and some ammunition, was consultedon the occasion. Such was his opinion and assurances of success that awar was determined on and took place immediately. Victory soon followedthrough the means of those few arms and many of the Ulietea and Bolabolamen were killed. In this contest their flints proved bad, or probably thelocks of the muskets had got out of order: this they remedied by alighted stick, one man presenting the musket and another with the burntstick setting fire to the priming; without which contrivance their armswould have proved useless. This expedition it seems consumed all theirammunition. Peace was soon after established, but I did not understandthat Omai had increased his possessions or his rank. Nevertheless I havereason to conclude that he was in some degree of favour with hiscountrymen from the general good character which they give of him. Itappears that he always remembered England with kindness; for his accountsto his countrymen have been such as to give them not only a great idea ofour power and consequence but of our friendship and goodwill towards him.Tyvarooah, the eldest of the New Zealand boys that were left with him,died a short time after Omai: about Coah, the youngest, I had alwaysdoubtful accounts till I came to Huaheine, where I learnt that helikewise was dead.CHAPTER 8.Expedition to Tettaba after a Heifer.Extraordinary domestic Arrangements.Tinah's Mother visits the Ship.A Sheep brought from Ulietea.Heavy Storm.Death of the Surgeon.Taowne and Toahroah Harbours examined.1788. November.After dinner I went on shore and, while I was at the tents, from havingexposed myself too much in the sun, I was taken ill and continued in muchpain for near an hour. This was soon known among the natives and I wasexceedingly surprised to see Tinah and all the principal people, both menand women, collecting round me and offering their assistance. For thisshort illness I was made ample amends by the pleasure I received from theattention and appearance of affection in these kind people.Friday 14.This morning I had numberless enquiries after my health. The weatherbeing fine I invited Tinah, Oreepyah, and Poeeno, to accompany me toTettaha in order to enquire after the cow; and soon after sunrise we setoff in the launch. Tettaha is nearly four leagues from Point Venus. Onour arrival Tinah sent a man to give notice of our visit. The chief ofthe district, whose name was Teppahoo, did not appear, but sent amessenger to demand if I came only to see the cow or to take it away withme. In answer to this I sent assurances that I only desired to see it,and the chiefs who were with me spoke to the same effect. I was thendesired to proceed in the boat farther along shore to the westward. Inour way Tinah made me stop among some fishing canoes to purchase fish forhim, which he eat raw with salt water for sauce. When we arrived at thelanding-place a great number of people had collected, and soon afterTeppahoo arrived. Oreepyah and I went with him about a quarter of a mile,when I was shown one of the most beautiful heifers I ever saw. I asked ifthey had any more but they all said there was no other than a bull atItteah, as before mentioned. I could not refrain from expressing mydispleasure at the destruction and the foolish separation of these fineanimals. I had shared with Captain Cook in the trouble of this businessand had been equally anxious for the success.The district of Tettaha is not so luxuriant and fruitful as the countryabout Matavai. As I saw nothing of consequence to detain me I made apresent to Teppahoo and, after inviting him to visit me on board theship, which he promised to do, I took leave. Tinah had remained all thistime in the boat. I observed that no respect was shown to him at thisplace, nor was he able to procure a coconut or a breadfruit otherwisethan by purchasing it. The heifer being here is a proof of this districtnot having been friendly to the people of Matavai and Oparre.In our way back, having to row against the wind, we stopped to refresh atOparre, and it was eight o'clock by the time we arrived at the ship. Ikept my fellow travellers on board to supper and they did not fail toremind me of the king's health.Monday 17.Our collection of breadfruit plants at the tents continued increasing.This morning I sent twelve on board, in pots, to discover where theywould thrive the best, the air being more temperate on board the shipthan on shore. While I was absent from the ship Teppahoo had been onboard and left a hog as a present for me.After dinner today Tinah, who was my constant visitor, left the tablesooner than usual. When he was gone Oreepyah, his brother, and Oedidde,told me a piece of scandal, which had been before hinted to me but whichtill now I had not heard of with certainty: this was that Iddeah, Tinah'swife, kept a gallant, who was a towtow, or servant, and the very personwho always fed Tinah at dinner: and this was so far from being withoutTinah's knowledge or consent that they said it was by his desire. Theyadded many other circumstances and, as I appeared to doubt, they tookseveral opportunities in the course of the day of mentioning it to otherpeople, who all declared it was true.Tuesday 18.This afternoon I saw Teppahoo and invited him on board: before we partedI bargained with him for the heifer which he promised to bring in fivedays. My intention was that if I got the heifer I would endeavour topurchase the bull at Itteah: but if that could not be done then I couldsend the heifer as a present to the possessor of the bull, which mightequally well answer my purpose.It has been mentioned that Tinah had a place in my cabin to keep thosethings which I gave him as being more secure on board than on shore. Ihad remarked lately that his hoard seemed to diminish the more Iendeavoured to increase it: at length I discovered that Iddeah keptanother hoard in the master's cabin, which she regularly enriched fromher husband's whenever I made him a present, apprehending that I shouldcease giving when I saw Tinah's locker full. At his request I set thecarpenters to work to make him a chest large enough for himself and wifeto sleep on. Captain Cook had formerly given him such a chest but it hadbeen taken from him by the Eimeo people.Friday 21.This forenoon I received a message from Teppahoo to acquaint me theheifer was brought to Matavai. I immediately went on shore and found thathe had been as good as his word. The purchase money was paid, whichconsisted of a shirt, a hatchet, a spike nail, a knife, a pair ofscissors, a gimlet, and file; to which was added a small quantity ofloaf-sugar. Teppahoo appeared well pleased with his bargain; and I sentthe heifer to Poeeno's residence near which was plenty of grass.In the afternoon I was invited to a heiva, the most extraordinary part ofwhich was an oration, with some ceremonies in compliment to us. Twelvemen were divided into four ranks, with two women in the front; behindthem all stood a priest who made a speech which lasted ten minutes andwhich was listened to with some attention. During this the picture ofCaptain Cook, which had been brought for that purpose, was placed by myside. When the priest left off speaking a piece of white cloth waswrapped round the picture and another piece round me. The priest thenspoke again for a short time, and an old man placed a piece of plaitedcoconut leaf at my feet; the same was done to Tinah, and one piece wasput under the picture. After this the dancing began, which was in thesame style that we had already seen.The head of the ship was the figure of a woman, and not ill carved. As wewere painting the ship's upper works I directed this figure to be paintedin colours, with which the islanders were much pleased. Not only the menbut the women desired me to bring English women when I came again. TodayOedidde, thinking I was not convinced of the truth of what he had told meabout Iddeah, mentioned the affair to the lady herself in my hearing, atwhich she laughed, but said he did ill to tell me of it. However it wasevident she was not much offended for they were both very much divertedin discoursing upon the subject.I find it is not at all uncommon for brothers to have connection with thewives of each other, particularly elder brothers with the wives of theiryounger brothers, which is generally allowed and no offence taken: but ifany person not belonging to the family endeavours at the same intimacy itis resented as an injury. Inclination seems to be the only binding law ofmarriage at Otaheite.As I purposed to get instruments on shore at Point Venus to makeobservations I desired Tinah to order a house to be brought there for me,which was done and fixed in half an hour, being only a light shedsupported by posts.Monday 24.Today I bought a turtle that was caught on the reefs. As Tinah was goingto leave me for a few days I had it dressed for his dinner. He told methat his mother, Oberreeroah, was arrived from the island Tethuroa, andbegged that I would send for her in the morning and take care of her tillhe returned, which I willingly promised.Tuesday 25.This morning I sent a boat to Oparre, which returned in the afternoonwith Oberreeroah and two women, her servants. As she was old andcorpulent it was with difficulty that we helped her up the ship's side.As soon as she was in the ship she sat down on the gangway and, claspingmy knees in her arms, expressed her pleasure at seeing me by a flood oftears. Her servants then produced three pieces of cloth which, with alarge hog, some breadfruit, plantains, and coconuts, she had brought as apresent. As she was fatigued by her journey she wished to remain on boardall night, and I directed accommodations to be prepared, which was donewith little trouble as nothing more was necessary than a mat and somecloth spread on the deck. She had with her a favourite cat, bred from onethat had been given her by Captain Cook. She told me all the misfortunesthat had befallen her son and friends since Captain Cook left Otaheite.All the accounts agree in some of the cattle being now alive at theisland Eimeo: in the number they differ but that there were eight is theleast account.Wednesday 26.In the morning, Oberreeroah being desirous to go on shore, I made her apresent of several things, which she did not care to take with her then,but requested that I would keep them safe for her. Only Moannah andPoeeno dined with me today. They told me that Tinah and his brotherOreepyah were not on good terms together, and it was imagined that theywould fight as soon as the ship was gone. I had observed a coolnessbetween them, and had at times endeavoured to make them more cordial, butwith very little effect. Their quarrel has arisen from a disagreementbetween their wives.In the afternoon a canoe from Ulietea arrived in which was an Earee orchief of that island, who is a nephew to Oberreeroah. He brought a sheepwith him: the poor animal was infected with the mange and in very poorcondition. The climate had not as far as I could judge altered thequality of the wool, with which he was well covered except a part aboutthe shoulders. I imagine this animal to be the English ewe left byCaptain Cook. The owner assured me that there were ten sheep at Huaheine;the truth of which I much doubted. I was surprised and rather mortifiedto find that he set so little value on this as to let me have it, at thefirst word, for a small adze. I sent it to be kept at Poeeno's with theheifer.Friday 28.Tinah and his wife returned to Matavai and, from appearances which I haveno reason to mistrust, were sincerely glad to see me again after theirshort absence. They brought as usual a present of a hog and fruit. Thismorning there was an eclipse of the sun, but the weather was so cloudythat I had only an opportunity of observing the end of the eclipse, whichwas at 19 hours 43 minutes 53 seconds.Saturday 29.I sent a man to shear the ewe, by which a remedy could more easily beapplied to cure the disease with which it was infected. The garden madenear the tents was not in a prosperous condition: most of the melons andcucumbers were destroyed by insects; and the soil being sandy was notfavourable to the other seeds. I therefore chose another spot of groundfarther from the seaside and had an assortment of seeds sown.December. Monday 1.In the night the rudder of one of the boats was stolen from the tents. Onlanding in the morning neither Tinah nor any of his family came near me,being, I was informed, afraid of my displeasure. As the loss was notgreat I immediately sent to assure them that I had no anger exceptagainst the person who committed the theft. In consequence of thismessage Tinah and some of the other chiefs came to the tents and promisedthat they would exert themselves to discover the thief and get the rudderrestored. This was the first theft of any consequence that had beencommitted since the tents were on shore, and my suspicions fell chieflyon the people who were here from some of the other islands. Tinah hadjust begun to build a house for himself and I promised that ourcarpenters should assist him. Whydooah, the youngest brother of Tinah,had lately been one of my constant visitors and seemed to have left offhis former custom of getting drunk with the Ava. He was esteemed one oftheir best warriors; and I was told that in the quarrel with the peopleof Eimeo he killed Maheine the chief of that island.Friday 5.The weather for some time past had been very unsettled. This afternoonthe wind blew fresh from the north-west, which occasioned the sea tobreak very high across the Dolphin bank; and in the night such a heavybroken sea came into the bay that we were obliged to batten all thehatchways down, and to keep everybody upon deck all night though the raincame down in torrents. The ship rolled in a most violent manner.Saturday 6.In the morning the wind increasing and, there being no possibility ofputting to sea, we struck yards and topmasts and trusted to our anchors.The river swelled so much with the rain that the point of land on whichthe tents stood became an island; and to preserve the breadfruit plantsfrom being endangered the people were obliged to cut a passage for theriver through a part of the beach at a distance from the tents. The seabroke very high on the beach; nevertheless a canoe put off and to mysurprise Tinah, his wife, and Moannah made their way good through thesurf and came on board to see me. There was no other person in the canoefor the weather did not admit of useless passengers: each of them had apaddle which they managed with great activity and skill. These kindpeople embraced me with many tears and expressed their apprehensions forthe safety of the ship. Towards noon however the sea abated considerably,but the wind continued to blow strong from the north-west. At sunsetIddeah went on shore but Tinah would remain with me the whole night.Sunday 7.The wind continued between the north and north-west but had so muchmoderated that I no longer considered our situation to be alarming. Atnoon Iddeah returned to the ship with a large hog and a supply ofbreadfruit and coconuts; and soon after she and Tinah left the ship,having exacted a promise from me that if the weather was moderate I wouldgo on shore in the morning and visit their parents and sister who, theytold me, had been much alarmed on our account. I received a visitlikewise from Poeeno and his wife. This woman had always shown greatregard for us; and now, on our meeting, before I could be aware of it,she began beating her head violently with a shark's tooth so that herface was covered with blood in an instant. I put a stop to this as soonas I could, and with the drying up of the blood her agitation subsided.This ceremony is frequently performed upon occasions either of joy orgrief. Her husband said that if any accident happened to the ship Ishould live with him and that they would cut down trees and build meanother ship.From this sample of the weather and the information of the natives I wasconvinced it would not be safe to continue in Matavai Bay much longer;and I determined to get everything ready for sailing as speedily as Icould.Monday 8.The night proved moderate and in the morning I went on shore where I wasreceived by Oberreeroah, and several other friends with great affection.The plants received no injury from the bad weather having been carefullycovered from the spray of the sea: some were in a dormant state andothers were striking out young shoots. Nelson thought that it was betterto refrain a few days from taking them on board; I therefore consented todefer it. He was of opinion that the plants could be propagated from theroots only, and I directed some boxes to be filled as we could stow themwhere no others could be placed.Tuesday 9.This afternoon, in hauling the launch on shore to be repaired, many ofthe natives assisting, one of them, a fine boy about ten years old, wasthrown down and a roller which was placed under the boat went over him.The surgeon being ill I sent off for his assistant. Fortunately no limbwas broken nor did he receive any material injury. The surgeon had been along time ill, the effect of intemperance and indolence. He had latterlyscarce ever stirred out of his cabin but was not apprehended to be in adangerous state; nevertheless this evening he appeared to be so muchworse than usual that it was thought necessary to remove him to someplace where he could have more air; but to no effect for he died in anhour afterwards. This unfortunate man drank very hard and was so averseto exercise that he never would be prevailed on to take half a dozenturns upon deck at a time in the course of the voyage.Wednesday 10.As I wished to bury the surgeon on shore I mentioned it to Tinah, whosaid there would be no objection but that it would be necessary to askhis father's consent first; which he undertook to do and immediately leftme for that purpose. By this circumstance it appears that, though theeldest son of an Earee succeeds to the title and honours of the father assoon as he is born, yet a considerable portion of authority remains withthe father even after the son is of age. When Tinah returned I went withhim to the spot intended for the burial place, taking with us two men todig the grave; but on our arrival I found the natives had already begunit. Tinah asked me if they were doing right? "There," says he, "the sunrises and there it sets." The idea that the grave should be east and westI imagine they learnt from the Spaniards, as the captain of one of theirships was buried at Oeitepeha in 1774. Certain it is they had not theinformation from anybody belonging to our ship; for I believe we shouldnot have thought of it. The grave however was marked out very exactly. Atfour in the afternoon the body was interred: the chiefs and many of thenatives came to see the ceremony and showed great attention during theservice. Some of the chiefs were very inquisitive about what was to bedone with the surgeon's cabin on account of apparitions. They said when aman died in Otaheite and was carried to the Tupapow that as soon as nightcame he was surrounded by spirits, and if any person went there byhimself they would devour him: therefore they said that not less than twopeople together should go into the surgeon's cabin for some time. I didnot endeavour to dissuade them from this belief otherwise than bylaughing and letting them know that we had no such apprehensions.In the afternoon the effects of the deceased were disposed of and Iappointed Mr. Thomas Denman Ledward the surgeon's mate to do duty assurgeon.Friday 12.I went in a boat to examine the harbours about Oparre and found twoformed by the reefs. The westernmost is the most convenient for sailingin or out but is not well sheltered from a north-west wind or sea. Thisharbour is called by the natives Taowne: it is about a league and a halfdistant from Point Venus and may be known by a remarkable mountain,called by the natives Wawry, which bears south-south-east from theentrance.The easternmost harbour is called Toahroah. It is small but as secure asa reef harbour can well be. It is about three miles distant from PointVenus. The chief objection to this harbour is the difficulty of gettingout with the common tradewind, the entrance being on the east side, notmore than one hundred yards wide and the depth without inconvenient forwarping. On the south side of the entrance is a Morai: the reef side isto be kept on board and a lookout to be kept from aloft, whence the shoalwater is better discerned than from the deck.Sunday 14.This forenoon we performed divine service. Many of the principal nativesattended and behaved with great decency. Some of the women at one timebetrayed an inclination to laugh at our general responses; but on mylooking at them they appeared much ashamed. After the service I was askedif no offering was to be made for the Eatua to eat.The weather had been fair all the last week and at this time appearedquite settled, so that I was under no apprehensions of danger fromcontinuing a little longer in Matavai bay.CHAPTER 9.A Walk into the Country.The Peeah Roah.Prevailed on by the Kindness of the Chiefs to defer our Departure.Breadfruit Plants collected.Move the Ship to Toahroah Harbour.Fishing.Three of the Ship's Company desert.Indiscretion of our People on Shore.Instances of Jealousy.Mourning.Bull brought to Oparre by a Prophet.The Deserters recovered.Tinah proposes to visit England.1788. December. Wednesday 17.This morning I took a walk into the country accompanied by Nelson and myold friend Moannah. The breadth of the border of low land before wearrived at the foot of the hills was near three miles. This part of ourjourney was through a delightful country, well covered with breadfruitand coconut-trees, and strewed with houses in which were swarms ofchildren. We then proceeded along a valley, still among houses, withplantations of yams, tarro, the cloth-plant, and their favourite root theAva: there were breadfruit trees on the sides of the hills which weredwarfs in comparison of those on the low land. Our walk was very muchinterrupted by a river, the course of which was so serpentine that we hadto cross it several times, being carried over on men's shoulders.On arriving at a Morai I saw a number of the natives collected and wasinformed that the priests were performing their devotions. Sixteen menwere sitting on their heels; in the front was a pole covered with aplaited coconut branch, and before each of the men there was a number ofsmall pieces of the same leaf plaited, which they call Hahyree, and eachhad likewise a piece round his wrist. One who appeared to be the chiefpriest prayed aloud, and was answered by all the rest together: after afew short sentences and responses they rose and each carried an Hahyree,which they placed at the foot of the pole and returned to prayer: thiswas repeated till all the Hahyree were delivered and then the ceremonyended. I must not forget to mention that they had placed near the pole anoffering of plantains and breadfruit, which they left for the Eatua. Theyvery kindly asked us to partake of a roasted hog that had been preparedfor them whilst they were praying; but as I wished to make the most ofthe morning before the sun was too high I declined their offer, andMoannah bespoke refreshments to be ready for us when we returned.We continued our walk up the valley, which became very narrow, and hadadvanced a considerable way beyond all the houses and plantations when wewere suddenly stopped by a cascade that fell into the river from a heightof above 200 feet: the fall at this time was not great but in the heavyrains must be considerable. The natives look upon this as the mostwonderful sight in the island. The fall of water is the least curiouspart; the cliff over which it comes is perpendicular, forming anappearance as if supported by square pillars of stone, and with aregularity that is surprising. Underneath is a pool eight or nine feetdeep into which the water falls; and in this place all the natives make apoint of bathing once in their lives, probably from some religious idea.The hills here approach each other within a few yards and are wellcovered with wood. As the road appeared difficult I did not care toproceed towards the mountain. I cannot with certainty say how far thiscurious precipice is from the bay, but think in the road by which we wentit cannot be less than seven miles. It is called Peeah Roah.In our return we found a young pig prepared for us and we made a heartymeal. We dined in the house of an old acquaintance of Nelson's for whomhe had in 1777 planted the two shaddock plants formerly mentioned whichhe had brought from the Friendly Islands. These we had the satisfactionto see were grown to fine trees and full of fruit.In their plantations they do not take much pains except with the Ava andthe Cloth-plant, both of which they are careful to keep clear of weeds.Many of the plantations of the cloth-plant were fenced with stone andsurrounded with a ditch. The yams and plantains are mostly on the highergrounds. As soon as we had finished our dinner we returned towards theship. I was much delighted in this walk with the number of children thatI saw in every part of the country: they are very handsome and sprightlyand full of antic tricks. They have many diversions that are common withthe boys in England such as flying kites, cats cradle, swinging, dancingor jumping in a rope, walking upon stilts and wrestling.Friday 19.The wind today blew fresh but continued regular from the east andeast-south-east. We had likewise much rain and a long swell set into thebay. I had not yet determined whether, on leaving Matavai bay, I would goto the island Eimeo or to the harbour of Toahroah near Oparre: thisuncertainty made Tinah and the rest of my friends very anxious; and theyappeared much distressed on my desiring them this afternoon to send onboard all the things which they wished to have repaired by the forgewithout delay, that what they wanted might be done before the ship leftMatavai, which I told them would be in a few days. They very earnestlyentreated I would stay one month longer. I represented this as impossibleand asked Tinah if he would not go with me to Eimeo; but he said thatnotwithstanding my protection he was certain the Eimeo people would watchfor an opportunity to kill him. He remained on board with me all nightbut his wife went on shore and returned early in the morning, bringingwith her some axes and other things that were in need of repair.Saturday 20.When I went on shore I found Otow, Oberree-roah, Moannah, and severalothers in great tribulation at the thoughts that we were so soon to leavethem. All the people of Matavai I saw were much concerned at my intentionof going to Eimeo, and took every opportunity to prejudice me against thepeople of that island; to which I paid very little attention as theirmotive was obvious.Sunday 21.Their expressions of friendship and affection for me however I could notdisregard, as I had no doubt of their being genuine and unaffected, and Ifelt my unwillingness to leave these kind people so much increased thatthe next day I sent the master in the launch to reexamine the depth ofwater between this bay and Toahroah harbour. He returned in the eveningand acquainted me that he found a good bottom with not less than sixteenfathoms depth all the way. The harbour of Toahroah appearing every waysafe I determined to get the ship there as speedily as possible, and Iimmediately made my intention public, which occasioned great rejoicing.Wednesday 24.This day we took the plants on board, being 774 pots, all in a healthystate; for whenever any plant had an unfavourable appearance it wasreplaced by another. The number of those rejected was 302, of which notone in ten but was found to be growing at the root.The natives reckon eight kinds of the breadfruit tree, each of which theydistinguish by a different name. 1. Patteah. 2. Eroroo. 3. Awanna. 4.Mi-re. 5. Oree. 6. Powerro. 7. Appeere. 8. Rowdeeah. In the first,fourth, and eighth class the leaf differs from the rest; the fourth ismore sinuated; the eighth has a large broad leaf not at all sinuated. Thedifference of the fruit is principally in the first and eighth class. Inthe first the fruit is rather larger and more of an oblong form: in theeighth it is round and not above half the size of the others. I enquiredif plants could be produced from the seed and was told they could not butthat they must be taken from the root. The plants are best collectedafter wet weather, at which time the earth balls round the roots and theyare not liable to suffer by being moved.The most common method of dividing time at Otaheite is by moons; but theylikewise make a division of the year into six parts, each of which isdistinguished by the name of the kind of breadfruit then in season. Inthis division they keep a small interval called Tawa in which they do notuse the breadfruit. This is about the end of February when the fruit isnot in perfection; but there is no part of the year in which the treesare entirely bare.Thursday 25.At daylight we unmoored and I sent the tents in the launch to Oparre withdirections that, after landing them, the launch should meet the ship inthe entrance of Toahroah harbour to show the safest part of the channel.At half-past ten we got the ship under sail and ran down under top-sails:when we were near the launch it fell calm and the ship shot past her. Weimmediately let the anchor go but to our great surprise we found the shipwas aground forwards. She had run on so easy that we had not perceived itat the time. This accident occasioned us much trouble as we were obligedto send anchors out astern to get the ship afloat: in doing this one ofthe cables swept a rock and was not got clear again without muchdifficulty. When the ship was moored Point Venus bore north 46 degreeseast. The east point of the harbour north 65 degrees east one-quarter ofa mile. Our distance from the shore half a cable's length; depth of water8 1/2 fathoms.Friday 26.The next morning on my landing I was welcomed by all the principalpeople; I may say by the whole crowd, and congratulated on the safety ofthe ship. Tinah showed me a house near the waterside abreast the ship,which he desired I would make use of and which was large enough for allour purposes. He and his brother Oreepyah then desired I would stay andreceive a formal address and present which they called Otee. To this Iassented and a stool was brought for me to sit on. They then left me withMoannah and in a short time I saw Tinah returning with about twenty menwho all made a stop at some distance, and a priest said a short prayer tothe Eatua, to which the rest made reply. A man was then sent to me threeseveral times, at each time bringing me a small pig and the stem of aplantain leaf. The first they told me was for the God of Brittannee, thenext for King George, and the last for myself. Moannah then got up and,without being dictated to, made an oration for me; the purport of which Iunderstood to be that I received their offering with thanks; that we weregood people and friends; and therefore he exhorted them to commit nothefts: he told them to bring their pigs, coconuts, and breadfruit, andthey would receive good things in return; that we took nothing withouttheir consent; and finally that every man was to quit the place (thehouse we occupied) at night; for if they made any visit in the dark theywould be killed. With this speech the ceremony ended.I found this a delightful situation and in every respect convenient. Theship was perfectly sheltered by the reefs in smooth water and close to afine beach without the least surf. A small river with very good waterruns into the sea about the middle of the harbour. I gave directions forthe plants to be landed and the same party to be with them as at Matavai.Tinah fixed his dwelling close to our station.Monday 29.Some of the natives took advantage of the butcher's negligence and stolehis cleaver. I complained of this to the chiefs who were on board andthey promised that they would endeavour to recover it; but an article sovaluable as this was to the natives I had no great expectation of seeingrestored.The ship continued to be supplied by the natives as usual. Coconuts werein such plenty that I believe not a pint of water was drunk on board theship in the twenty-four hours. Breadfruit began to be scarce though wepurchased without difficulty a sufficient quantity for our consumption:there was however another harvest approaching which they expected wouldbe fit for use in five or six weeks. The better kind of plantains alsowere become scarce; but a kind which they call vayhee were in greatplenty. This fruit does not hang on the trees like the other kinds butgrows upon an upright stalk of considerable strength and substance.Though this plantain is inferior in quality to most of the others itaffords great subsistence to the natives. We received almost every daypresents of fish, chiefly dolphin and albacore, and a few small rockfish. Their fishing is mostly in the night when they make strong lightson the reefs which attract the fish to them. Sometimes in fine weatherthe canoes are out in such numbers that the whole sea appearsilluminated. In the canoes they fish with hook and line and on the reefsthey struck the fish with a spear. Some likewise carry out small netswhich are managed by two men. In the daytime their fishing canoes gowithout the reefs, sometimes to a considerable distance, where they fishwith rods and lines and catch bonetas and other fish. Whenever there is ashow of fish a fleet of canoes immediately proceeds to sea. Their hooksbeing bright are used without bait in the manner of our artificial flies.Their rods are made of bamboo; but when there are any very large fishthey make use of an outrigger over the fore part of the canoe, abouttwenty-five feet in length, which has two prongs at the extremity, toeach of which is fastened a hook and line; and when a fish takes the hookit is raised by ropes managed by two men in the stern of the canoe.January 1789. Thursday 1.Contrary to my expectation Tinah this afternoon brought on board thecleaver that had been stolen. The thief had taken it to Attahooroo, andTinah told me, which I could easily believe, that it was given up withreluctance.Friday 2.The next morning I offered Tinah a present of axes and other things but,as he suspected this was meant by way of return for getting the cleaverrestored, he would not be prevailed with to accept a single article.I had constantly the company of Tinah, his wife, and some of hisrelations; but the royal children, though so near us, never came in sightof the ship. The river separated them from the place occupied by ourpeople on shore and, for fear of giving alarm or offence, I gave strictorders that no one should attempt to go near their place of residence.Monday 5.At the relief of the watch at four o'clock this morning the small cutterwas missing. I was immediately informed of it and mustered the ship'scompany, when it appeared that three men were absent: Charles Churchill,the ship's corporal and two of the seamen, William Musprat and JohnMillward, the latter of whom had been sentinel from twelve to two in themorning. They had taken with them eight stand of arms and ammunition; butwhat their plan was, or which way they had gone, no one on board seemedto have the least knowledge. I went on shore to the chiefs and soonreceived information that the boat was at Matavai; and that the desertershad departed in a sailing canoe for the island Tethuroa. On thisintelligence I sent the master to Matavai to search for the small cutter,and one of the chiefs went with him; but before they had got halfway theymet the boat with five of the natives who were bringing her back to theship. This service rendered me by the people of Matavai pleased me muchand I rewarded the men accordingly.I told Tinah and the other chiefs that I expected they would get thedeserters brought back; for that I was determined not to leave Otaheitewithout them. They assured me that they would do everything in theirpower to have them taken and it was agreed that Oreepyah and Moannahshould depart the next morning for Tethuroa. Oreepyah enquired if theyhad pocket pistols "for," said he, "though we may surprise and seize thembefore they can make use of their muskets, yet if they have pistols theymay do mischief, even while they are held." I quietened theseapprehensions by assuring them that the deserters had no pistols withthem.Tuesday 6.At daylight Oreepyah and Moannah set off in two canoes for Tethuroa, butthe weather became so boisterous that they were obliged to return in theforenoon, and I was happy to see them get safe in as the sea ran veryhigh without the harbour. From the first of this month the weather andwinds had been much unsettled with a great deal of rain. Our formerstation at Matavai appeared not at all safe, the sea at times breakinghigh over the Dolphin bank and making a great swell in the bay. Oreepyahand Moannah both promised me that they would sail again as soon as theweather should be fine.Friday 9.The wind continued to blow strong at sea though in the harbour we had attimes but light breezes. Poeeno, from Matavai, came to see me today: hesaid he was apprehensive that I was displeased with him on account of ourdeserters having been carried to Tethuroa by a canoe from Matavai. Thishe declared had been done before he heard of it; and that the onlyservice in his power he had not neglected to do for me, which was thesending our boat back. As this was really an act of friendship I receivedhim with great cordiality; and he assured me that there could be no doubtfrom the directions Tinah had given of the deserters being brought to theship as soon as the weather would admit canoes to go after them.Saturday 10.One of the officers this morning on shore inadvertently plucked a branchfrom a tree called Tutuee, that bears the oil nut, which was growing at aMorai. On entering with it into the house occupied by our people all thenatives, both men and women, immediately went away. When I went on shoreI found this branch tied to one of the posts of the house, although theeffect it had on the natives was known. I was much displeased at thispiece of wantonness and ordered the branch to be taken away; but thenatives notwithstanding would not come near the place. They said thehouse was taboo, which I understand to signify interdicted, and that noneof them might approach it till the taboo was taken off, which could onlybe done by Tinah. To take anything away from a Morai is regarded as akind of sacrilege and, they believe, gives great offence to the Eatua. Atmy request Tinah took off the taboo, but not before the afternoon. Thiswas performed by an offering of a plantain leaf at the Morai, and aprayer made to the Eatua. After this ceremony the house was resorted toby the natives as usual.I had not yet given up the hope of obtaining the bull from Itteah, thoughI had hitherto received no satisfactory answer to the messages whichTinah had sent at my desire: I therefore spoke to Poeeno who undertook tonegotiate this business, and I commissioned him to make very liberaloffers. He left me after dinner to return to Matavai. In the evening amessenger arrived from him to acquaint me that, in his absence, the sheepwhich I had trusted to his care had been killed by a dog; and that he hadsent the culprit, hoping that I would kill him for the offence he hadcommitted. This poor sheep had been so much diseased that I could nothelp suspecting he died without the dog's assistance, and that the storyof the dog was invented to prevent my attributing it to want of care.This doubt did not appear in my answer; as for the dog I told themessenger to do with him what he pleased.Tuesday 13.This morning, the weather being more moderate than it had been for somedays past, Oreepyah sailed with two canoes for Tethuroa.Wednesday 14.Some business prevented Moannah from accompanying him but he followed thenext day with two other canoes. The wood that we had got at Matavai beingexpended I applied to Tinah, who sent three trees down to the watersidebefore night, which when cut up made a good launch load.I saw two instances of jealousy today one of which had nearly producedfatal consequences. A man was detected with a married woman by thehusband, who stabbed him in the belly with a knife: fortunately theintestines escaped and the wound did not prove dangerous. The otherinstance was a girl, who had constantly lived with my coxswain, beatinganother girl that she discovered to have been too intimate with him.Friday 16.In walking today with Tinah near a tupapow I was surprised by a suddenoutcry of grief. As I expressed a desire to see the distressed personTinah took me to the place where we found a number of women, one of whomwas the mother of a young female child that lay dead. On seeing us theirmourning not only immediately ceased, but to my astonishment they allburst into an immoderate fit of laughter, and while we remained appearedmuch diverted with our visit. I told Tinah the woman had no sorrow forher child otherwise her grief would not have so easily subsided; on whichhe jocosely told her to cry again: they did not however resume theirmourning in our presence. This strange behaviour would incline us tothink them hardhearted and unfeeling, did we not know that they are fondparents and in general very affectionate: it is therefore to be ascribedto their extreme levity of disposition; and it is probable that deathdoes not appear to them with so many terrors as it does to people of amore serious cast.Sunday 18.I received a message from Poeeno to acquaint me that he had beensuccessful in his negotiation for the bull, which he had driven part ofthe way by land, but could not get farther on account of the rivers andtherefore desired a boat should be sent for him. I accordingly orderedthe launch to be got ready and at two o'clock the next morning Mr. Fryer,the master, set off in her.Monday 19.In the afternoon the launch returned with the bull and my friend Poeeno.For the night I directed that the bull should remain at Oparre and thenext day he was taken to the cow at Matavai.Wednesday 21.Today Poeeno brought to me the person from whom he had the bull toreceive the stipulated payment, which was one of every article of trafficthat I had in my possession. This man, whose name was Oweevee, they toldme was inspired by a divine spirit; and that in all matters ofconsequence he was consulted, for that he conversed with the Eatua. Itwas, they said, the Eatua that ordered him to demand the bull from Tinah,which not to have complied with would have been the height of impiety. Iendeavoured to convince them of the roguery of this man, thinking I had afair argument to prove it by his selling that which the Eatua had orderedhim to keep; but here I was easily defeated for it seems the Eatua toldhim to sell me the beast. This being the case I said I would not give theanimals to any person; that they were now mine and that I would leavethem under the protection of Poeeno and Tinah who I hoped would take careof them for me till I returned. They both entered into my views andpromised the animals should be attended to, and told me that, while theywere considered as my property, no one would attempt to take them away.Thursday 22.This afternoon I received a message from Teppahoo to inform me that ourdeserters had passed this harbour and were at Tettaha, about five milesdistant. I ordered the cutter to be got ready, and a little before sunsetleft the ship, taking Oedidee with me. By his advice I landed at somedistance from the place where the deserters were but, thinking itnecessary to have the boat within call, and Oedidee assuring me thatthere was safe landing farther on, I directed the boat to proceed alongshore whilst Oedidee and I walked along the beach. The night was verydark and windy and the shore being rocky I soon lost sight of the boat. Afew of the natives had joined us in our walk and from their manner I hadreason to suspect them of a design to close upon us, with an intention nodoubt to plunder: I was provided with pocket-pistols and on producing onethey left us. Oedidee was so much alarmed that I could scarce prevail onhim to proceed. When we arrived at Teppahoo's house we were very kindlyreceived by him and his wife. The cutter was arrived but there being avery high surf she could not come within a hundred yards of the shore.The deserters I was informed were in a house close to us, and I imaginedthere would be no great difficulty in securing them with the assistanceof the natives. They had however heard of my arrival; and when I was nearthe house they came out without their arms and delivered themselves up. Isent directions off to the boat for one of my people to come on shore andfor the boat to return to the place where I had landed. My next businesswas to secure the arms, which I delivered to Teppahoo to take charge offor the night. One musket and two bayonets were missing, which they saidwere lost by the canoe in which they came from Tethuroa having overset. Ithen took leave of Teppahoo who presented us with a plentiful supply ofprovisions, and we proceeded with the deserters towards the boat but, asthe wind had increased and it rained hard, I determined to remain onshore till the morning; and having found shelter for the people we passedthe remainder of the night without accident. At daylight I sent for thearms and we returned to the ship.Friday 23.I learnt from the deserters that at Tethuroa they had seen Oreepyah andMoannah, who had made an attempt to secure them. They said it was theirintention to have returned to the ship; and it is probable that they wereso much harassed by the natives watching for an opportunity to surprisethem that they might wish to have the merit of returning of their ownaccord, to avoid the disgrace of being seized and brought back. At thetime they delivered themselves up to me it was not in their power to havemade resistance, their ammunition having been spoiled by the wet.In consequence of my having been kept all night from the ship by thetempestuous weather the timekeeper went down at 10 hours 5 minutes 36seconds. Its rate previous to this was 1 second, 7 losing in 24 hours,and its error from the mean time at Greenwich was 7 minutes 29 seconds, 2too slow. I set it going again by a common watch, corrected byobservations, and endeavoured to make the error the same as if it had notstopped; but being over cautious made me tedious in setting it in motion,and increased the error from mean time at Greenwich. The rate of going Idid not find to have altered.At dinner Tinah congratulated me on having recovered my men, butexpressed some concern that they had not been brought by Oreepyah andMoannah, lest I should imagine they had not done everything in theirpower. To this I replied that I was perfectly satisfied of their goodintentions to serve me, and that I considered myself under greatobligations to them for the trouble they had been at on my account. Ilearnt afterwards that they had actually seized and bound the desertersbut had been prevailed upon, by fair promises of their returningpeaceably to the ship, to let them loose: the deserters however, findingan opportunity to get possession of their arms, again set the natives atdefiance.Friday 30.This afternoon I punished one of the seamen, Isaac Martin, with nineteenlashes for striking an Indian. This was a transgression of so serious anature and such a direct violation of my orders that I would on noaccount be prevailed on to forgive it, though great intercession was madeby some of the chiefs.Oreepyah and Moannah were not yet returned from Tethuroa. This place isresorted to by the principal people of this part of Otaheite atparticular seasons when fish are in great plenty there. It was describedto me to be a group of small keys surrounded by a reef: their produce ischiefly coconuts and plantains. During the season breadfruit and otherprovisions are daily carried over from Otaheite. Not less than a hundredsail of canoes were at Tethuroa when our deserters were there.Teppahoo and his wife were become my constant visitors: he had for sometime past been ill, and had made Oparre his place of residence for thebenefit of our surgeon's advice and assistance. At this time hecomplained of a hoarseness and sore throat. Mr. Ledward, on examininghim, discovered there had been two holes in the roof of his mouth which,though healed, had the appearance of having been large: the adjacentparts appeared sound, yet the surgeon was of opinion that they werecancerous and would in the end occasion his death.Saturday 31.This morning I ordered all the chests to be taken on shore, and theinside of the ship to be washed with boiling water to kill thecockroaches. We were constantly obliged to be at great pains to keep theship clear of vermin on account of the plants. By the help of traps andgood cats we were freed from rats and mice. When I was at Otaheite withCaptain Cook there were great numbers of rats about all the houses, andso tame that they flocked round the people at their meals for the offalswhich were commonly thrown to them; but at this time we scarce ever saw arat which must be attributed to the industry of a breed of cats left hereby European ships.After breakfast I walked with Tinah to Matavai to see the cattle and thegardens. Tinah had already taken so large a dose of the Ava that he wasperfectly stupefied. Iddeah however was with us, and she is one of themost intelligent persons I met with at Otaheite. We went first toPoeeno's house and saw the bull and cow together in a very fine pasture.I was informed that the cow had taken the bull; so that if no untowardaccident happens there is a fair chance of the breed being established.In the garden near Poeeno's house many things had failed. The Indian cornwas in a fine state and I have no doubt but they will cultivate it allover the country. A fig-tree was in a very thriving way, as were twovines, a pineapple plant, and some slips of a shaddock-tree. From thisplace we walked to the garden at Point Venus, but I had the mortificationto find almost everything there destroyed by the hogs. Some undergroundpeas and Indian corn had escaped, and likewise the caliloo green and ocraof Jamaica.We returned to the ship, and after dinner I was not a little surprised tohear Tinah seriously propose that he and his wife should go with me toEngland. He said he would only take two servants; that he much wished tosee King George who he was sure would be glad to see him. Tinah and manyof his countrymen were become extremely eager to get a knowledge of othercountries, and were continually enquiring about the situations of theislands which we told them of in these seas. To quiet his importunity Iwas obliged to promise that I would ask the king's permission to carrythem to England if I came again; that then I should be in a larger shipan could have accommodations properly fitted up. I was sorry to find thatTinah was apprehensive he should be attacked by his enemies as soon asour ship left Otaheite, and that if they joined they would be toopowerful for him. The illness of Teppahoo, with whom he was on goodterms, gave him much uneasiness, Teppahoo's wife being a sister of Otow'sand aunt to Tinah. They have no children as has been before related, andif Teppahoo were to die he would be succeeded as Earee of the district ofTettaha by his brother who is an enemy to Tinah. I have on every occasionendeavoured to make the principal people believe that we should returnagain to Otaheite and that we should revenge any injury done in ourabsence to the people of Matavai and Oparre.The wife of Oedidee is likewise an aunt to Tinah, and sister to Otow. Hisnative place is Ulietea, where he has some property, but which I imagineis not of such consequence to him as the countenance of the chiefs withwhom he is connected at Otaheite.CHAPTER 10.The Ship's Cable cut in the Night.Coolness with the Chiefs on that Account.Visit to an old Lady.Disturbance at a Heiva.Tinah's Hospitality.A Thief taken and punished.Preparations for sailing.1789. February. Tuesday 3.I was present this afternoon at a wrestling match where a young man, byan unlucky fall, put his arm out of joint at the elbow: three stout menimmediately took hold of him and, two of them fixing their feet againsthis ribs, replaced it. I had sent for our surgeon but before he arrivedall was well, except a small swelling of the muscles in consequence ofthe strain. I enquired what they would have done if the bone had beenbroken and, to show me their practice, they got a number of sticks andplaced round a man's arm, which they bound with cord. That they haveconsiderable skill in surgery is not to be doubted. I have beforementioned an instance of an amputated arm being perfectly healed andwhich had every appearance of having been treated with great propriety.The part of the beach nearest the ship was become the general place ofresort towards the close of the day. An hour before sunset theinhabitants began to collect, and here they amused themselves withexercising the lance, dancing, and various kinds of merriment, tillnearly dark, when they retired to their homes. Of this cheerful scene wewere spectators and partakers every fine evening.Friday 6.An occurrence happened today that gave me great concern, not only onaccount of the danger with which the ship had been threatened, but as ittended greatly to diminish the confidence and good understanding whichhad hitherto been constantly preserved between us and the natives. Thewind had blown fresh in the night, and at daylight we discovered that thecable by which the ship rode had been cut near the water's edge in such amanner that only one strand remained whole. While we were securing theship Tinah came on board. I could not but believe he was perfectlyinnocent of the transaction; nevertheless I spoke to him in a veryperemptory manner, and insisted upon his discovering and bringing to methe offender. I was wholly at a loss how to account for this maliciousact. My suspicions fell chiefly, I may say wholly, on the strangers thatcame to us from other parts of the island; for we had on every occasionreceived such unreserved and unaffected marks of goodwill from the peopleof Matavai and Oparre that in my own mind I entirely acquitted them. Theanger which I expressed however created so much alarm that old Otow andhis wife (the father and mother of Tinah) immediately quitted Oparre, andretired to the mountains in the midst of heavy rain, as did Teppahoo andhis family. Tinah and Iddeah remained and expostulated with me on theunreasonableness of my anger against them. He said that he would exerthis utmost endeavours to discover the guilty person, but it mightpossibly not be in his power to get him delivered up, which would be thecase if he was either of Tiarraboo, Attahooroo, or of the island Eimeo.That the attempt might have been made as much out of enmity to the peopleof Matavai and Oparre as to me, everyone knowing the regard I had forthem, and that I had declared I would protect them against their enemies.All this I was inclined to believe, but I did not think proper to appearperfectly satisfied lest Tinah, who was naturally very indolent, shouldbe remiss in his endeavours to detect the offender. To guard as much aspossible against future attempts of this kind I directed a stage to bebuilt on the forecastle so that the cables should be more directly underthe eye of the sentinel; and I likewise gave orders that one of themidshipman should keep watch forward.In the afternoon Oreepyah returned from Tethuroa. He told me that Moannahand himself had narrowly escaped being lost in the bad weather and thatMoannah had been obliged to take shelter at Eimeo. Several canoes hadbeen lost lately in their passage to or from Tethuroa. The oversetting oftheir canoes is not the only risk they have to encounter, but isproductive of another danger more dreadful; for at such times many becomea prey to the sharks which are very numerous in these seas. I wasinformed likewise that they were sometimes attacked by a fish which bytheir description I imagine to be the barracoota, as they attribute to itthe same propensity.Saturday passed without my seeing anything of Tinah the whole day.Sunday 8.The next morning he and Iddeah came to me and assured me that they hadmade the strictest enquiries concerning the injury intended us but hadnot been able to discover any circumstance which could lead them tosuspect who were concerned in it. This was not at all satisfactory and Ibehaved towards them with great coolness, at which they were muchdistressed, and Iddeah at length gave vent to her sorrow by tears. Icould no longer keep up the appearance of mistrusting them, but Iearnestly recommended to them, as they valued the King of England'sfriendship, that they would exert their utmost endeavours to find out theoffenders, which they faithfully promised. Our reconciliation accordinglytook place and messengers were sent to acquaint Otow and Teppahoo, and toinvite them to return.It has since occurred to me that this attempt to cut the ship adrift wasmost probably the act of some of our own people; whose purpose ofremaining at Otaheite might have been effectually answered without dangerif the ship had been driven on shore. At the time I entertained not theleast thought of this kind, nor did the possibility of it enter into myideas, having no suspicion that so general an inclination or so strong anattachment to these islands could prevail among my people as to inducethem to abandon every prospect of returning to their native country.A messenger came to me this afternoon from the Earee of Tiarrabou, thesouth-east division of Otaheite, with an invitation for me to visit him.I excused myself on account of the distance and, at Tinah's request, sentback by the messenger a handsome present which I hope Tinah will get thecredit of. I observed with much satisfaction that a great part of whatTinah had received from me he had distributed; to some out of friendshipand esteem, and to others from motives of political civility.Tuesday 10.Teppahoo and his family left us today to go to Tettaha, where a grandheiva was to be performed, at which their presence was required.Wednesday 11.A small party of heiva people passed through Oparre this morning in theirway to Tettaha, where they were going by appointment. They had thecivility to send me word that if I chose they would stay to perform ashort heiva before me; and I immediately attended. It began by a dance oftwo young girls to the music of drums and flutes which lasted no longtime; at the conclusion they suddenly dropped all their dress, which wasleft as a present for me, and went off without my seeing them any more.After this the men danced: their performance was more indecent than any Ihad before seen, but was not the less applauded on that account by thenatives, who seemed much delighted.After this entertainment I went with Tinah and Iddeah to pay a visit toan old lady named Wanowoora, widow to Towah the late Earee of Tettaha,who conducted the expedition against Eimeo when Captain Cook was here in1777. The old lady had just landed and we found her sitting on the beachby the head of her canoe. With Tinah was a priest and three men, whocarried a young dog, a fowl, and two young plantain boughs: these wereintended for the offering, or present, called Otee. Tinah and his partyseated themselves at about ten yards distance from Wanowoora and wereaddressed by her in short sentences for a few minutes, and received herOtee, which was exactly the same as his. Tinah's priest in return made ashort prayer and his offering was presented to the old lady. Tinah thenrose and went to her, and embraced her in a very affectionate manner; andshe returned his kindness with tears and many expressions which I couldnot understand. Soon after he conducted her to a shed and we remainedwith her till it was time to go on board to dinner. I invited her to beof the party but she excused herself on account of age and infirmity.Tinah gave directions for her and her attendants to be supplied withwhatever they had occasion for, and we went off to the ship.Friday 13.This forenoon Tinah sent to inform me that many strangers were arrivedfrom all parts to be present at a grand heiva which he had prepared incompliment to me. I accordingly went on shore and found a great crowd ofpeople collected together. A ring was made at a little distance from ourpost, and Tinah and several other chiefs came to meet me. When we wereall seated the heiva began by women dancing; after which a present ofcloth and a tawme or breastplate was laid before me. This ceremony beingover the men began to wrestle and regularity was no longer preserved. OldOtow came to me and desired I would help to put a stop to the wrestlingas the people came from different districts, some of which were illdisposed towards others. What Otow had apprehended was not without reasonfor in an instant the whole was tumult: every man took to his arms and,as I found my single interference could be of no service, I retired toour post and ordered all my people there under arms. At the time thedisturbance began Tinah and Iddeah were absent: their first care was forme, and Iddeah came to see if I was safe at the post. She had a doublecovering of cloth round her and her waist was girded with a large rope. Idesired her to stay under my protection: this she would not consent tobut said she would return as soon as all was over; and away she went.I immediately gave orders for two guns to be fired from the ship withoutshot, which had a good effect: and as no chief was concerned in thetumult but, on the contrary, all of them exerted their influence toprevent mischief, everything was soon quiet and Tinah and Iddeah returnedto let me know that all was settled. They went on board with some otherchiefs and dined with me.After dinner I went on shore with Tinah and his friends, and I foundthree large hogs dressed, and a quantity of breadfruit which he hadordered to be prepared before he went on board, and now desired I wouldpresent them to the different parties that had come to see theentertainment: one to the chief people of Attahooroo, one to the Arreoys,and a third to the performers of the heiva. I presented them according tohis directions and they were received with thankfulness and pleasure.This I looked upon as very handsomely done on the part of Tinah, and Iwas glad to see that it was regarded in the same light by his guests.These instances of liberality make full amends for the little slips whichI have formerly noticed in Tinah. At this time a day seldom passed thathe did not give proofs of his hospitality by entertaining the principalpeople that came from different parts of the island to visit him, or tosee the ship. Some of the chiefs he commonly invited to dine on board,and made provision for others on shore. Scarce any person of consequencewent away without receiving some present from him. This I encouraged andwas glad it was in my power to assist him. But besides the politicalmotives that I have alluded to it would be unjust to Tinah not toacknowledge that his disposition seemed improved: he was more open andunreserved in his manners than formerly, and his hospitality was naturaland without ostentation.Monday 16.I was present this afternoon at a wrestling match by women. The manner ofchallenging and method of attack was exactly the same as among the men.The only difference that I could observe was not in favour of the softersex; for in these contests they showed less temper and more animositythan I could have imagined them capable of. The women, I was told, notonly wrestle with each other but sometimes with the men; of this I havenever seen an instance and imagine it can happen but seldom, as the womenin general are small and by no means masculine. Iddeah is said to be veryfamous at this exercise.Tuesday 17.I walked with Tinah towards the hills to see his country residence whichwas at a very neat house, pleasantly situated and surrounded withplantations. From this place we saw the island Tethuroa. The next morningI went to Matavai to look after the Indian corn which I judged would befull ripe for gathering; but on my arrival I found that the natives hadbeen beforehand with me, the whole being taken away. This I was not atall sorry for as it shows that they value it too much to neglectcultivating it.Monday 23.Iddeah sent on board for our dinners today a very fine tarro pudding; andTinah brought a bunch of bananas that weighed 81 pounds, on which were286 fine fruit: ten had broken off in the carriage. The tarro pudding isexcellent eating and easily made: I shall describe this piece of cookeryas the knowledge of it may be useful in the West Indies. The tarro beingcleared of the outside skin is grated down, and made up in rolls of abouthalf a pound each, which they cover neatly with leaves and bake for nearhalf an hour. An equal quantity of ripe coconut meat is likewise grated,from which through a strainer the rich milky juice is expressed. Thisjuice is heated by putting smooth hot stones in the vessel that containsit, and the tarro is then mixed with it and kept constantly stirring toprevent burning till it is ready, which is known by the coconut juiceturning to a clear oil.Wednesday 25.Iddeah was very uneasy today on account of her youngest child being ill.She would not accept of assistance from our surgeon but said she had sentto Tettaha for a man who she expected would come and tell her what to do.These physical people are called tata rapaow.Thursday 26.This morning a man died of a consumption about two miles from our post. Iwas informed of it by Mr. Peckover, the gunner, who I had desired to lookout for such a circumstance. I therefore went accompanied by Iddeah inhopes of seeing the funeral ceremony; but before we arrived the body wasremoved to the Toopapow. It lay bare except a piece of cloth round theloins and another round the neck: the eyes were closed: the hands wereplaced, one over the pit of the stomach and the other upon his breast. Ona finger of each hand was a ring made of plaited fibres of thecoconut-tree, with a small bunch of red feathers. Under the Toopapow ahole was dug, in which at the end of a month the corpse was to be buried.The deceased was of the lower class; the Toopapow however was neat, andofferings of coconuts and plaited leaves lay on the ground.The dead are sometimes brought to the Toopapow in wood coffins, which arenot shaped like ours but are simply a long box. This custom Iddeahinformed me they learnt from the Europeans, and is not very common, asmaking plank is a work of great labour.March. Monday 2.When I landed this morning I found the inhabitants that lived near to ushad left their houses and retired towards the mountains; and was informedthat in the night a water cask, part of an azimuth compass, and Mr.Peckover's bedding, had been stolen from the post on shore; the knowledgeof which had caused a general alarm. I sent a message to complain of thistheft to Tinah who did not come near me. About two hours elapsed, duringwhich time I went on board to breakfast and returned when I saw Tinah andOreepyah with a number of people at a house at some distance; and soonafter they all marched to the eastward, passing close by our post.Oedidee, who was with me, told me that they had intelligence of thethief, and were gone in quest of him: and in less than an hour news wasbrought that they had taken him. Shortly after the whole party appearedwith the water-cask and compass. Tinah had hold of the thief by the armand, showing him to me, desired that I would kill him. The bedding, hesaid, he had not heard of, but would go in search of it. I applauded himfor the pains he had taken in this business, and explained with somesuccess the injustice of stealing from us: that if any of our peoplecommitted the least offence against them it did not pass unnoticed; andthat friendship required on their part that those who injured us shouldnot be protected by them. Tinah stopped me from saying more by embracingme and the whole crowd cried out Tyo myty (i.e. good friend). Tinah thenleft me to enquire after the bedding, and I sent the offender on board,whom I punished with a severe flogging. I was glad to find this man wasnot of Oparre or Matavai.The fine fruit called Avee was just coming into season: it was likewisein season at the time of our arrival in October. The breadfruit trees Ihave no doubt bear all the year round: we have seen a scarcity ofbreadfruit but have never been wholly without it. Some fern-root wasshown to me which in scarce seasons is used by the natives as bread. Itbears a long even-edged leaf about an inch wide; the taste somewhatresembled that of a yam. I was informed by our people that in their walksthey saw in many places patches of Indian corn just making theirappearance through the ground. This convinces me that the corn taken fromMatavai could not have been better disposed of.Goats are frequently offered for sale, but I rather discouraged thebuying of them for fear of injuring the breed. The natives will not eatthem, neither will they taste the milk, and ask with some appearance ofdisgust why we do not milk the sows? I endeavoured to prevail on Tinahand Iddeah to eat the goats milk by mixing it with fruit, but they wouldonly try one spoonful.We had begun to make preparations for sailing, and Tinah supplied us witha sufficient stock of wood by ordering trees to be brought down from thecountry. He had frequently expressed a wish that I would leave somefirearms and ammunition with him, as he expected to be attacked after theship sailed, and perhaps chiefly on account of our partiality to him: Itherefore thought it but reasonable to attend to his request, and I wasthe more readily prevailed on as he said his intentions were to act onlyon the defensive. This indeed seems most suited to his disposition, whichis neither active nor enterprising. If Tinah had spirit in proportion tohis size and strength he would probably be the greatest warrior inOtaheite: but courage is not the most conspicuous of his virtues. When Ipromised to leave with him a pair of pistols, which they prefer tomuskets, he told me that Iddeah would fight with one and Oedidee with theother. Iddeah has learnt to load and fire a musket with great dexterityand Oedidee is an excellent marksman. It is not common for women in thiscountry to go to war, but Iddeah is a very resolute woman, of a largemake, and has great bodily strength.Friday 6.I sent Mr. Fryer the master to sound Taowne harbour. The knowledge thatwe intended shortly to sail having spread among the natives a great manybroken iron tools were brought from all parts of the island to berepaired at our forge; and this morning a messenger arrived fromWaheatua, the Earee of Tiarraboo, with several pieces of Spanish ironwhich he desired to have made into small adzes. This request was ofcourse complied with.CHAPTER 11.Arrival of an Arreoy Woman from Tethuroa.A Present delivered by Tinah for his Majesty.Other Occurrences to the Time of the Ship's Departure from Otaheite.1789. March.From the 5th to the 14th of this month the wind blew constantly frombetween the north-west and south-west with a great deal of rain. This wasthe longest continuance of westerly winds without interruption that weexperienced. On the 13th several canoes arrived here and at Matavai fromTethuroa: in these were a large tribe of Arreoys, and among them HuheineMoyere, the wife of Oreepyah, who is an Arreoy woman, and remained atTethuroa after Oreepyah came away. On her arrival a ceremony wasperformed called Hooepippee, which seemed to be designed as a publicvisit to all their friends, who are collected on the occasion. In thisceremony there was nothing remarkable: the Arreoy men took theiropportunity to plunder the women who were near them, and Iddeah made apresent of some cloth to Huheine Moyere, and a baked hog to the Arreoys.Friday 13.After this ceremony a present was produced from many of the principalpeople for young Otoo, the Earee Rahie, which was received by Iddeah,Tinah being absent. This present consisted of five hogs, and forty-eightbaskets filled with breadfruit, coconuts, tarro, and different kinds ofpuddings. The baskets were decorated with slips of cloth, stained withvariety of colours and carried by 24 men, each of whom had a pole on hisshoulder, at each end of which was a basket.I have seldom spoken of Otoo who was too young to have any share in themanagement of affairs, and with whom we were not permitted to have anyintercourse, except speaking to him now and then across a river; at whichtimes I did not neglect to send the children some little presents, sothat they always rejoiced to see me. I might have been admitted to anearer acquaintance if I would have gone with my shoulders uncovered, ashis parents did, but this I declined. The children do not all live underthe same roof, the two sisters eating and sleeping in a separate house,though at other times they are generally together.The island Tethuroa may very properly be compared to some of ourwatering-places in England, producing a similar effect upon those whovisit it. Many who went there covered with scurf returned plump and fair,and scarce like the same people. This alteration for the better is in agreat measure to be attributed to the discontinuance of the Ava, whichTethuroa does not produce: the coconut trees, likewise, which supply themwith their only beverage, growing on low sandy keys and having theirroots below the level of the sea may probably have qualities differentfrom the coconuts of Otaheite which, with a plenty of fish, that at othertimes they are not accustomed to, must no doubt contribute to theamendment described.Saturday 14.I was visited today by a very old man, an uncle to Tupia, the person whowent from these islands in the Endeavour in the year 1769, and who diedat Batavia. He appeared to be near 70 years old and was treated with muchrespect by the natives. He made several enquiries concerning his nephewand requested that when I came again I would bring his hair. At the timethat Tinah mentioned to me his desire of visiting England I asked whataccount I could give to his friends if he should not live to return; towhich he replied that I must cut off his hair and carry it to them andthey would be perfectly satisfied.Monday 16.On the 16th I was informed that a stop was put to the sale of hogs in thedistrict of Tettaha. Teppahoo, the Earee of that district, told me thatthey had very few hogs left there, and that it was necessary for acertain time to prohibit every person from killing or selling, that theymight have time to breed. I did not think it reasonable to solicit anyindulgence on this head: my friends at Matavai and Oparre promised tosupply us as long as we remained here, though we had considerably thinnedtheir stock. After our departure the same restriction was to take placein these districts, and it being delayed on our account certainlydeserves to be regarded among their acts of friendship towards us.As it was generally known that we were preparing to sail a number of thenatives from other parts of the island were constantly with us, and pettythefts were committed whenever the negligence of our people afforded anopportunity: but no attempt of any consequence was made.Thursday 19.This evening Mr. Samwel my clerk returned from an excursion to themountains, having been two days absent. He described the hills to be wellclothed with wood, except the tops of the higher mountains which onlyproduced bushes and fern. The birds he saw were blue parakeets and greendoves, except one which he found burrowing in the ground and brought tome. This bird was about the size of a pigeon, and proved to be awhite-bellied petrel of the same kind as those seen in high latitudes,which are called shearwaters. He likewise brought a branch of a plantlike the New Zealand tea-plant, and which at Van Diemen's land we hadmade use of for brooms. From the hills he saw the islands Maitea andHuaheine, which are situated nearly in opposite directions from Otaheiteand are 70 leagues distant from each other.Friday 27.For some days past Tinah had been busied in getting two parais, ormourning-dresses, made, which he intended as a present to King George.Being finished they were this morning hung up in his house as a publicexhibition, and a long prayer made on the occasion, the substance ofwhich was that the King of England might forever remain his friend andnot forget him. When he presented the parais for me to take on board hecould not refrain from shedding tears. During the short remainder of ourstay here there appeared among the natives an evident degree of sorrowthat we were so soon to leave them, which they showed by unusual kindnessand attention.We began this afternoon to remove the plants to the ship. They were inexcellent order: the roots had appeared through the bottom of the potsand would have shot into the ground if care had not been taken to preventit.The weather was considerably altered for the better and the tradewindappeared settled. The rainy and bad season of the year may be reckoned tobegin towards the end of November and to continue till near the end ofMarch. During this time the winds are variable and often westerly, thoughwe seldom found them to blow strong in that direction. We likewiseexperienced frequent intervals of fine weather; but during these monthsso open a road as Matavai bay is not a safe anchoring-place for shipsthat intend remaining any length of time at Otaheite.Tuesday 31.Today all the plants were on board, being in 774 pots, 39 tubs, and 24boxes. The number of breadfruit plants were 1015, besides which we hadcollected a number of other plants. The avee, which is one of thefinest-flavoured fruits in the world. The ayyah, which is a fruit not sorich but of a fine flavour and very refreshing. The rattah, not muchunlike a chestnut, which grows on a large tree in great quantities: theyare singly in large pods from one to two inches broad, and may be eatenraw or boiled in the same manner as Windsor beans, and so dressed areequally good. The oraiah, which is a very superior kind of plantain. Allthese I was particularly recommended to collect by my worthy friend, SirJoseph Banks. I had also taken on board some plants of the ettow andmatte, with which the natives here make a beautiful red colour; and aroot called peeah, of which they make an excellent pudding.I now made my last presents to several of my friends with whom I had beenmost intimate, particularly to Teppahoo. Several people expressed greatdesire to go with us to England. Oedidee, who was always very muchattached to us, said he considered it as his right, having formerly lefthis native place to sail with Captain Cook. Scarce any man belonging tothe ship was without a tyo, who brought to him presents, chiefly ofprovisions for a sea store.April. Friday 3.Tinah and his wife, with his parents, brothers, and sister, dined with metoday and, as I meant to sail early the next morning, they all remainedon board for the night. The ship was crowded the whole day with thenatives, and we were loaded with coconuts, plantains, breadfruit, hogs,and goats. In the evening there was no dancing or mirth on the beach suchas we had been accustomed to, but all was silent.Saturday 4.At daylight we unmoored: the stock of the best bower anchor was so mucheaten by the worms that it broke in stowing the anchor: the small bowerhad an iron stock, and in these voyages it is very necessary that shipsshould be provided with iron anchor stocks. At half-past six there beingno wind we weighed and, with our boats and two sweeps, towed the ship outof the harbour. Soon after the sea breeze came, and we stood off towardsthe sea.The outlet of Toahroah harbour being narrow I could permit only a few ofthe natives to be on board: many others however attended in canoes tillthe breeze came, when I was obliged to leave them. We stood off and onalmost all the remainder of the day. Tinah and Iddeah pressed me verystrongly to anchor in Matavai bay and stay one night longer but, as I hadalready taken leave of most of my friends, I thought it better to keep tomy intention of sailing. After dinner I ordered the presents which I hadpreserved for Tinah and his wife to be put in one of the ship's boats,and as I had promised him firearms I gave him two muskets, a pair ofpistols, and a good stock of ammunition. I then represented to them thenecessity of their going away, that the boat might return to the shipbefore it was dark, on which they took a most affectionate leave of meand went into the boat. One of their expressions at parting was "Yourahno t' Eatua tee eveerah." "May the Eatua protect you, for ever and ever."All the time we remained at Otaheite the picture of Captain Cook, at thedesire of Tinah, was kept on board the ship. On delivering it to him Iwrote on the back the time of the ship's arrival and departure, with anaccount of the number of plants on board.Tinah had desired that I would salute him at his departure with the greatguns, which I could not comply with for fear of disturbing the plants;but as a parting token of our regard we manned ship with all hands andgave him three cheers. At sunset the boat returned and we made sail,bidding farewell to Otaheite where for twenty-three weeks we had beentreated with the utmost affection and regard, and which seemed toincrease in proportion to our stay. That we were not insensible to theirkindness the events which followed more than sufficiently proves: for tothe friendly and endearing behaviour of these people may be ascribed themotives for that event which effected the ruin of an expedition thatthere was every reason to hope would have been completed in the mostfortunate manner.To enter into a description of the island or its inhabitants I look uponas superfluous. From the accounts of former voyages and the facts which Ihave related the character of the people will appear in as true a lightas by any description in my power to give. The length of time that weremained at Otaheite, with the advantage of having been there before,gave me opportunities of making perhaps a more perfect vocabulary of thelanguage than has yet appeared; but I have chosen to defer it for thepresent as there is a probability that I may hereafter be betterqualified for such a task.We left Otaheite with only two patients in the venereal list, which showsthat the disease has not gained ground. The natives say that it is oflittle consequence, and we saw several instances of people that had beeninfected who, after absenting themselves for 15 or 20 days, made theirappearance again without any visible symptom remaining of the disease.Their method of cure I am unacquainted with; but their customary diet andmode of living must contribute towards it. We saw a great many peoplehowever with scrofulous habits and bad sores: these they denied to beproduced from any venereal cause; and our surgeon was of the sameopinion.The result of the mean of 50 sets of lunar observations taken by me onshore gives for the Longitude of Point Venus 210 degrees 33 minutes 57seconds east.Captain Cook in 1769 places it in 210 degrees 27 minutes 30 seconds east.In 1777, his last voyage, 210 degrees 22 minutes 28 seconds east.The tide in Toahroah harbour was very inconsiderable and not regular. Thegreatest rise that I observed was 11 inches; but what was most singularthe time of high-water did not appear to be governed by the moon, itbeing at the highest every day between noon and two o'clock. The variablewinds and weather at this time of the year has no doubt an influence onthe tides: on some days scarce any rise was perceptible.CHAPTER 12.At the Island Huaheine.A Friend of Omai visits the Ship.Leave the Society Islands.A Water-spout.The Island Whytootackee discovered.Anchor in Annamooka Road.Our Parties on Shore robbed by the Natives.Sail from Annamooka.The Chiefs detained on board.Part friendly.1789. April. Sunday 5.We steered towards the island Huaheine, which we got sight of the nextmorning. At noon we brought to near the entrance of Owharre harbour, itnot being my intention to anchor. We could see every part of the harbourdistinctly, but my attention was particularly directed to the spot whereOmai's house had stood, no part of which was now visible. It was nearthree o'clock before any canoes came off to us, for the people on shoreimagined that the ship was coming into the harbour. The first thatarrived had three men in it, who brought a few coconuts. I enquired aboutthe chief or Earee Rahie; and one of the fellows with great gravity saidhe was the Earee Rahie, and that he had come to desire I would bring theship into the harbour. I could not help laughing at his impudence:however I gave him a few nails for his coconuts and he left us.Immediately after a double canoe in which were ten men came alongside;among them was a young man who recollected and called me by my name.Several other canoes arrived with hogs, yams, and other provisions, whichwe purchased. My acquaintance told me that he had lived with our friendOmai. He confirmed the account that had already been given and informedme that of all the animals which had been left with Omai the mare onlyremained alive. He said that Omai and himself had often rode together,and I observed that many of the islanders who came on board had therepresentation of a man on horseback tattooed on their legs. After thedeath of Omai his house was broken to pieces and the materials stolen.The firearms were at Ulietea but useless. I enquired after the seeds andplants and was informed that they were all destroyed except one tree, butof what kind that was I could not make out from their description. I wasmuch pressed to take the ship into the harbour, and Omai's companionrequested me to let him go to England. When they found that I would notstop among them they seemed jealous of our going to Ulietea, and itappeared to give them some satisfaction when I told them that I shouldnot go near that island.The canoes had left us and we were making sail when we discovered anIndian in the water swimming towards the shore, which in all probabilityhe would not have been able to reach. We took him up and luckily anothercanoe coming alongside we put him in her. The people of the canoe saidthat the man was insane, but how he came to be swimming so far from theland we could not conjecture. At six o'clock we made sail and ran allnight to the south-west and south-west by south, between the islandsHuaheine and Ulietea. The next morning I altered the course, steeringmore to the westward for the Friendly Islands.Thursday 9.On the 9th at nine o'clock in the morning the weather became squally anda body of thick black clouds collected in the east. Soon after awater-spout was seen at no great distance from us, which appeared togreat advantage from the darkness of the clouds behind it. As nearly as Icould judge it was about two feet diameter at the upper part, and abouteight inches at the lower. I had scarce made these remarks when Iobserved that it was advancing rapidly towards the ship. We immediatelyaltered our course and took in all the sails except the foresail, soonafter which it passed within ten yards of our stern, making a rustlingnoise but without our feeling the least effect from its being so near us.The rate at which it travelled I judged to be about ten miles per hourgoing towards the west in the direction of the wind. In a quarter of anhour after passing us it dispersed. I never was so near a water-spoutbefore: the connection between the column, which was higher than ourmastheads, and the water below was no otherwise visible than by the seabeing disturbed in a circular space of about six yards in diameter, thecentre of which, from the whirling of the water round it, formed ahollow; and from the outer part of the circle the water was thrown upwith much force in a spiral direction, and could be traced to the heightof fifteen or twenty feet. At this elevation we lost sight of it andcould see nothing of its junction with the column above. It is impossibleto say what injury we should have suffered if it had passed directly overus. Masts I imagine might have been carried away, but I do not apprehendit would have endangered the loss of a ship.Saturday 11.As we sailed very near the track made in former voyages I had littlereason to expect that we should at this time make any new discovery:nevertheless on the 11th at daylight land was seen to thesouth-south-west at about five leagues distance, which appeared to be anisland of a moderate height. On the north part was a round hill: thenorth-west part was highest and steep: the south-east part sloped off toa low point.The wind had been westerly since the preceding noon, and at the time wesaw the land the ship was standing to the north-west. At six we tacked tothe southward, and as we advanced in that direction discovered a numberof low keys, of which at noon we counted nine: they were all covered withtrees. The large island first seen had a most fruitful appearance, itsshore being bordered with flat land, on which grew innumerable coconutand other trees; and the higher grounds beautifully interspersed withlawns. The wind being light and unfavourable we endeavoured all day butwithout success to get near the land. In the night we had a heavy squallwhich obliged us to clew up all our sails and soon after it fell calm.Sunday 12.The winds were light and variable all day with calms. At two in theafternoon we were within three miles of the southernmost key and couldsee a number of people within the reefs. Shortly after a canoe, in whichwere four men, paddled off to us and came alongside without showing anysigns of apprehension or surprise. I gave them a few beads and they cameinto the ship. One man, who seemed to have an ascendancy over the others,looked about the ship with some appearance of curiosity, but none of themwould venture to go below. They asked for some boiled fresh pork whichthey saw in a bowl belonging to one of the seaman, and it was given themto eat with boiled plantains. Being told that I was the Earee or chief ofthe ship the principal person came and joined noses with me, andpresented to me a large mother of pearl shell, which hung with plaitedhair round his neck; this he fastened round my neck with signs of greatsatisfaction.They spoke the same language as at Otaheite, with very little variationas far as I could judge. In a small vocabulary that I made whilstconversing with these men only four words out of twenty-four differedfrom the Otaheite. The name of the large island they told me wasWytootackee, and the Earee was called Lomakkayah. They said that therewere no hogs, dogs, or goats upon the island, nor had they yams, ortarro; but that plantains, coconuts, fowls, breadfruit, and avees, werethere in great abundance. Notwithstanding they said that no hogs were onthe island it was evident they had seen such animals; for they calledthem by the same name as is given to them at Otaheite, which made mesuspect that they were deceiving me. However I ordered a young boar andsow to be put into their canoe with some yams and tarro, as we couldafford to part with some of these articles. I also gave to each of them aknife, a small adze, some nails, beads, and a looking-glass. The latterthey examined with great curiosity; but with the ironwork they appearedto be acquainted; calling it aouree, which is the common name for ironamong the islands where it is known.As they were preparing to leave us the chief of the canoe took possessionof everything that I had given to the others. One of them showed somesigns of dissatisfaction, but after a little altercation they joinednoses and were reconciled. I now thought they were going to leave theship, but only two of them went into the canoe, the other two purposingto stay all night with us and to have the canoe return for them in themorning. I would have treated their confidence with the regard it meritedbut it was impossible to say how far the ship might be driven from theisland in the night. This I explained to them and they reluctantlyconsented to leave us. They were very solicitous that somebody from theship should go on shore with them, and just before they quitted us theygave me a wooden spear which was the only thing, the paddles excepted,they had brought with them in the canoe. It was a common longstaffpointed with the toa wood.The island of Wytootackee is about ten miles in circuit; its latitudefrom 18 degrees 50 minutes to 18 degrees 54 minutes south, and longitude200 degrees 19 minutes east. A group of small keys, eight in number, lieto the south-east, four or five miles distant from Wytootackee and asingle one to the west-south-west; the southernmost of the group is inlatitude 18 degrees 58 minutes south. Variation of the compass 8 degrees14 minutes east.The people that came off to us did not differ in appearance from thenatives of Hervey's Islands, seen in Captain Cook's last voyage, thoughmuch more friendly and inoffensive in their manners. They were tattooedacross the arms and legs, but not on the loins or posteriors, like thepeople of Otaheite. From their knowledge of iron they have doubtlesscommunication with Hervey's Islands, which are not more than eighteenleagues distant from them.In the night a breeze sprang up from the south and we continued ourcourse to the westward.Saturday 18.On the 18th at sunset we saw Savage Island, and in the night passed by tothe southward of it.Tuesday 21.At eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 21st we saw the island Caow fromthe masthead, bearing north-west by west three-quarters west. This islandis a high mountain with a sharp-pointed top, and is the north-westernmostof all the Friendly Islands. At noon we saw it very distinctly from thedeck, it being then nineteen leagues distant from us.Thursday 23.The wind being to the southward we could not fetch Annamooka, at whichisland I intended to stop, before the evening of the 23rd, when weanchored in the road in twenty-three fathoms, the extremes of Annamookabearing east by north and south by east, our distance from the shorebeing half a league. In the middle of the day a canoe had come off to usfrom the island Mango in which was a chief named Latoomy-lange, who dinedwith me. Immediately on our anchoring several canoes came alongside withyams and coconuts, but none of the natives offered to come on boardwithout first asking permission. As yet I had seen no person with whom Icould recollect to have been formerly acquainted. I made enquiries aftersome of our old friends, particularly the chiefs, but I found myself notsufficiently master of the language to obtain the information I wanted.Friday 24.Our station being inconvenient for watering at daylight we weighed, andworked more to the eastward where we anchored in twenty-one fathoms; theextremes of Annamooka bearing north 85 degrees east and south 33 degreeswest; the Sandy bay south 73 degrees east; our distance from the shorehalf a league. Sounded all round the ship and found the ground to be acoarse coral bottom, but with even soundings.By this time some large sailing canoes were arrived from differentislands in the neighbourhood of Annamooka; and an old lame man namedTepa, whom I had known in 1777 and immediately recollected, came onboard. Two other chiefs whose names were Noocaboo and Kunocappo were withhim. Tepa having formerly been accustomed to our manner of speaking theirlanguage I found I could converse with him tolerably well. He informed methat Poulaho, Feenow, and Tubow, were alive and at Tongataboo, and thatthey would come hither as soon as they heard of our arrival, of which hepromised to send them immediate notice. He said that the cattle which wehad left at Tongataboo had all bred, and that the old ones were yetliving. He enquired after several people who were here with Captain Cook.Being desirous to see the ship I took him and his companions below andshowed them the breadfruit and other plants, at seeing which they weregreatly surprised. I made each of them a present, and when they hadsatisfied their curiosity I invited them to go on shore with me in theship's boat.I took Nelson with me to procure some breadfruit plants, one of our stockbeing dead and two or three others a little sickly. When we landed therewere about two hundred people on the beach, most of them women andchildren. Tepa showed me a large boat-house which he told me we mightmake use of, thinking we should have a party on shore as our ships hadformerly. I went with him in search of water but could find no betterplace than where Captain Cook had watered, which is a quarter of a mileinland from the east end of the beach. I next walked to the west point ofthe bay where some plants and seeds had been sown by Captain Cook; andhad the satisfaction to see in a plantation close by about twenty finepineapple plants but no fruit, this not being the proper season. Theytold me that they had eaten many of them, that they were fine and large,and that at Tongataboo there were great numbers.When I returned to the landing-place I was desired to sit down and apresent was brought me which consisted of some bundles of coconuts only.This fell short of my expectations; however I appeared satisfied anddistributed beads and trinkets to the women and children near me.Numerous were the marks of mourning with which these people disfigurethemselves, such as bloody temples, their heads deprived of most of thehair, and what was worse almost all of them with the loss of some oftheir fingers. Several fine boys, not above six years old, had lost boththeir little fingers; and some of the men besides these had parted withthe middle finger of the right hand.The chiefs went off with me to dinner, and I found a brisk trade carryingon at the ship for yams; some plantains and breadfruit were likewisebrought on board but no hogs. In the afternoon more sailing canoesarrived, some of which contained not less than ninety passengers. Wepurchased eight hogs, some dogs, fowls, and shaddocks. Yams were in greatabundance, very fine and large; one yam weighed above forty-five pounds.Among the people that came this afternoon were two of the name of Tubow,which is a family of the first distinction among the Friendly Islands;one of them was chief of the island Lefooga; with him and Tepa I went onshore to see the wooding place. I found a variety of sizable trees butthe kind which I principally pitched upon was the Barringtonia ofForster. I acquainted Tepa with my intention of sending people to cutwood, which meeting with his approbation, we parted.Saturday 25.On the 25th at daylight the wooding and watering parties went on shore. Ihad directed them not to cut the kind of tree* which, when Captain Cookwooded here in 1777, blinded for a time many of the woodcutters. They hadnot been an hour on shore before one man had an axe stolen from him andanother an adze. Tepa was applied to, who got the axe restored but theadze was not recovered. In the evening we completed wooding.(*Footnote. Excoecaria agallocha Linn. Sp. Pl. Called in the Malaylanguage caju mata boota, which signifies the the tree that wounds theeyes.)Sunday 26.In the morning Nelson went on shore to get a few plants but, no principalchief being among the people, he was insulted, and a spade taken fromhim. A boat's grapnel was likewise stolen from the watering party. Teparecovered the spade for us, but the crowd of natives was become so great,by the number of canoes that had arrived from different islands, that itwas impossible to do anything where there was such a multitude of peoplewithout a chief of sufficient authority to command the whole. I thereforeordered the watering party to go on board and determined to sail, for Icould not discover that any canoe had been sent to acquaint the chiefs ofTongataboo of our being here. For some time after the thefts werecommitted the chiefs kept away, but before noon they came on board.At noon we unmoored, and at one o'clock got under sail. The two Tubows,Kunocappo, Latoomy-lange, and another chief, were on board, and Iacquainted them that unless the grapnel was returned they must remain inthe ship. They were surprised and not a little alarmed. Canoes wereimmediately despatched after the grapnel, which I was informed could notpossibly be brought to the ship before the next day, as those who hadstolen it immediately sailed with their prize to another island.Nevertheless I detained them till sunset, when their uneasiness andimpatience increased to such a degree that they began to beat themselvesabout the face and eyes and some of them cried bitterly. As this distresswas more than the grapnel was worth, and I had no reason to imagine thatthey were privy to or in any manner concerned in the theft, I could notthink of detaining them longer and called their canoes alongside. I thentold them they were at liberty to go, and made each of them a present ofa hatchet, a saw, with some knives, gimblets, and nails. This unexpectedpresent and the sudden change in their situation affected them not lesswith joy than they had before been with apprehension. They were unboundedin their acknowledgments and I have little doubt but that we partedbetter friends than if the affair had never happened.We stood to the northward all night with light winds.Monday 27.And on the next day the 27th at noon were between the islands Tofoa andKotoo. Latitude observed 19 degrees 18 minutes south.Thus far the voyage had advanced in a course of uninterrupted prosperity,and had been attended with many circumstances equally pleasing andsatisfactory. A very different scene was now to be experienced. Aconspiracy had been formed which was to render all our past labourproductive only of extreme misery and distress. The means had beenconcerted and prepared with so much secrecy and circumspection that noone circumstance appeared to occasion the smallest suspicion of theimpending calamity.CHAPTER 13.A Mutiny in the Ship.1789. April. Monday 27.We kept near the island Kotoo all the afternoon in hopes that some canoeswould come off to the ship; but in this I was disappointed. The windbeing northerly in the evening we steered to the westward to pass to thesouth of Tofoa. I gave directions for this course to be continued duringthe night. The master had the first watch, the gunner the middle watch,and Mr. Christian the morning watch. This was the turn of duty for thenight.Tuesday 28.Just before sun-rising, while I was yet asleep, Mr. Christian, with themaster at arms, gunner's mate, and Thomas Burkitt, seaman, came into mycabin, and seizing me tied my hands with a cord behind my back,threatening me with instant death if I spoke or made the least noise: Ihowever called as loud as I could in hopes of assistance; but they hadalready secured the officers who were not of their party by placingsentinels at their doors. There were three men at my cabin door besidesthe four within; Christian had only a cutlass in his hand, the others hadmuskets and bayonets. I was hauled out of bed and forced on deck in myshirt, suffering great pain from the tightness which with they had tiedmy hands. I demanded the reason of such violence but received no otheranswer than abuse for not holding my tongue. The master, the gunner, thesurgeon, Mr. Elphinstone, master's mate, and Nelson, were kept confinedbelow; and the fore hatchway was guarded by sentinels. The boatswain andcarpenter, and also the clerk, Mr. Samuel, were allowed to come upondeck, where they saw me standing abaft the mizenmast with my hands tiedbehind my back under a guard with Christian at their head. The boatswainwas ordered to hoist the launch out with a threat if he did not do itinstantly TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.When the boat was out Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet, two of the midshipmen,and Mr. Samuel, were ordered into it. I demanded what their intention wasin giving this order and endeavoured to persuade the people near me notto persist in such acts of violence; but it was to no effect: "Hold yourtongue, Sir, or you are dead this instant," was constantly repeated tome.The master by this time had sent to request that he might come on deck,which was permitted but he was soon ordered back again to his cabin.I continued my endeavours to turn the tide of affairs, when Christianchanged the cutlass which he had in his hand for a bayonet that wasbrought to him and, holding me with a strong grip by the cord that tiedmy hands, he with many oaths threatened to kill me immediately if I wouldnot be quiet: the villains round me had their pieces cocked and bayonetsfixed. Particular people were called on to go into the boat and werehurried over the side; whence I concluded that with these people I was tobe set adrift: I therefore made another effort to bring about a changebut with no other effect than to be threatened with having my brainsblown out.The boatswain and seamen who were to go in the boat were allowed tocollect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage, an eight and twenty-galloncask of water, and Mr. Samuel got 150 pounds of bread, with a smallquantity of rum and wine, also a quadrant and compass; but he wasforbidden on pain of death to touch either map, ephemeris, book ofastronomical observations, sextant, timekeeper, or any of my surveys ordrawings.The mutineers having forced those of the seamen whom they meant to getrid of into the boat, Christian directed a dram to be served to each ofhis own crew. I then unhappily saw that nothing could be done to effectthe recovery of the ship: there was no one to assist me, and everyendeavour on my part was answered with threats of death.The officers were next called upon deck and forced over the side into theboat, while I was kept apart from everyone, abaft the mizenmast;Christian, armed with a buoyant, holding me by the bandage that securedmy hands. The guard round me had their pieces cocked, but on my daringthe ungrateful wretches to fire they uncocked them.Isaac Martin, one of the guard over me, I saw had an inclination toassist me, and as he fed me with shaddock (my lips being quite parched)we explained our wishes to each other by our looks; but this beingobserved Martin was removed from me. He then attempted to leave the ship,for which purpose he got into the boat; but with many threats theyobliged him to return.The armourer, Joseph Coleman, and two of the carpenters, McIntosh andNorman, were also kept contrary to their inclination; and they begged ofme, after I was astern in the boat, to remember that they declared theyhad no hand in the transaction. Michael Byrne, I am told, likewise wantedto leave the ship.It is of no moment for me to recount my endeavours to bring back theoffenders to a sense of their duty: all I could do was by speaking tothem in general; but it was to no purpose, for I was kept securely boundand no one except the guard suffered to come near me.To Mr. Samuel I am indebted for securing my journals and commission withsome material ship papers. Without these I had nothing to certify what Ihad done, and my honour and character might have been suspected withoutmy possessing a proper document to have defended them. All this he didwith great resolution, though guarded and strictly watched. He attemptedto save the timekeeper, and a box with my surveys, drawings, and remarksfor fifteen years past, which were numerous, when he was hurried away,with "Damn your eyes you are well off to get what you have."It appeared to me that Christian was some time in doubt whether he shouldkeep the carpenter or his mates; at length he determined on the latterand the carpenter was ordered into the boat. He was permitted but notwithout some opposition to take his tool chest.Much altercation took place among the mutinous crew during the wholebusiness: some swore "I'll be damned if he does not find his way home, ifhe gets anything with him," (meaning me) and, when the carpenter's chestwas carrying away, "Damn my eyes he will have a vessel built in a month."While others laughed at the helpless situation of the boat, being verydeep and so little room for those who were in her. As for Christian heseemed as if meditating destruction on himself and everyone else.I asked for arms but they laughed at me, and said I was well acquaintedwith the people among whom I was going, and therefore did not want them;four cutlasses however were thrown into the boat after we were veeredastern.The officers and men being in the boat they only waited for me, of whichthe master at arms informed Christian, who then said: "Come, captainBligh, your officers and men are now in the boat and you must go withthem; if you attempt to make the least resistance you will instantly beput to death" and, without further ceremony, with a tribe of armedruffians about me, I was forced over the side where they untied my hands.Being in the boat we were veered astern by a rope. A few pieces of porkwere thrown to us, and some clothes, also the cutlasses I have alreadymentioned; and it was then that the armourer and carpenters called out tome to remember that they had no hand in the transaction. After havingundergone a great deal of ridicule and been kept some time to make sportfor these unfeeling wretches we were at length cast adrift in the openocean.I had with me in the boat the following persons:John Fryer: Master.Thomas Ledward: Acting Surgeon.David Nelson: Botanist.William Peckover: Gunner.William Cole: Boatswain.William Purcell: Carpenter.William Elphinston: Master's Mate.Thomas Hayward, John Hallet: Midshipman.John Norton, Peter Linkletter: Quarter Masters.Lawrence Lebogue: Sailmaker.John Smith, Thomas Hall: Cooks.George Simpson: Quarter Master's Mate.Robert Tinkler: A boy.Robert Lamb: Butcher.Mr. Samuel: Clerk.There remained on board the Bounty:Fletcher Christian: Master's Mate.Peter Haywood, Edward Young, George Stewart: Midshipmen.Charles Churchill: Master at Arms.John Mills: Gunner's Mate.James Morrison: Boatswain's Mate.Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Quintal, John Sumner, John Millward, WilliamMcKoy, Henry Hillbrant, Michael Byrne, William Musprat, Alexander Smith,John Williams, Thomas Ellison, Isaac Martin, Richard Skinner, MatthewThompson: Able Seamen.William Brown: Gardener.Joseph Coleman: Armourer.Charles Norman: Carpenter's Mate.Thomas McIntosh: Carpenter's Crew.In all 25 hands, and the most able men of the ship's company.Having little or no wind we rowed pretty fast towards Tofoa, which borenorth-east about 10 leagues from us. While the ship was in sight shesteered to the west-north-west, but I considered this only as a feint;for when we were sent away "Huzza for Otaheite" was frequently heardamong the mutineers.Christian the chief of the mutineers is of a respectable family in thenorth of England. This was the third voyage he had made with me and, as Ifound it necessary to keep my ship's company at three watches, I hadgiven him an order to take charge of the third, his abilities beingthoroughly equal to the task; and by this means the master and gunnerwere not at watch and watch.Haywood is also of a respectable family in the north of England and ayoung man of abilities as well as Christian. These two had been objectsof my particular regard and attention, and I had taken great pains toinstruct them, having entertained hopes that as professional men theywould have become a credit to their country.Young was well recommended and had the look of an able stout seaman: hehowever fell short of what his appearance promised.Stewart was a young man of creditable parents in the Orkneys, at whichplace on the return of the Resolution from the South Seas in 1780 wereceived so many civilities that on that account only I should gladlyhave taken him with me but, independent of this recommendation, he was aseaman and had always borne a good character.Notwithstanding the roughness with which I was treated the remembrance ofpast kindnesses produced some signs of remorse in Christian. When theywere forcing me out of the ship I asked him if this treatment was aproper return for the many instances he had received of my friendship? heappeared disturbed at my question and answered with much emotion: "That,captain Bligh, that is the thing; I am in hell, I am in hell."As soon as I had time to reflect I felt an inward satisfaction whichprevented any depression of my spirits: conscious of my integrity andanxious solicitude for the good of the service in which I had beenengaged I found my mind wonderfully supported, and I began to conceivehopes, notwithstanding so heavy a calamity, that I should one day be ableto account to my King and country for the misfortune. A few hours beforemy situation had been peculiarly flattering. I had a ship in the mostperfect order and well stored with every necessary both for service andhealth: by early attention to those particulars I had as much as lay inmy power, provided against any accident, in case I could not get throughEndeavour Straits, as well as against what might befall me in them; addto this the plants had been successfully preserved in the mostflourishing state: so that upon the whole the voyage was two-thirdscompleted, and the remaining part to all appearance in a very promisingway; every person on board being in perfect health, to establish whichwas ever amongst the principal objects of my attention.It will very naturally be asked what could be the reason for such arevolt? in answer to which I can only conjecture that the mutineers hadflattered themselves with the hopes of a more happy life among theOtaheiteans than they could possibly enjoy in England; and this, joinedto some female connections, most probably occasioned the wholetransaction.The women at Otaheite are handsome, mild and cheerful in their mannersand conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have sufficientdelicacy to make them admired and beloved. The chiefs were so muchattached to our people that they rather encouraged their stay among themthan otherwise, and even made them promises of large possessions. Underthese and many other attendant circumstances equally desirable it is nowperhaps not so much to be wondered at, though scarcely possible to havebeen foreseen, that a set of sailors, most of them void of connections,should be led away; especially when, in addition to such powerfulinducements, they imagined it in their power to fix themselves in themidst of plenty on one of the finest islands in the world, where theyneed not labour, and where the allurements of dissipation are beyondanything that can be conceived. The utmost however that any commandercould have supposed to have happened is that some of the people wouldhave been tempted to desert. But, if it should be asserted that acommander is to guard against an act of mutiny and piracy in his own shipmore than by the common rules of service, it is as much as to say that hemust sleep locked up and when awake be girded with pistols.Desertions have happened more or less from most of the ships that havebeen at the Society Islands; but it has always been in the commanderspower to make the chiefs return their people: the knowledge thereforethat it was unsafe to desert perhaps first led mine to consider with whatease so small a ship might be surprised, and that so favourable anopportunity would never offer to them again.The secrecy of this mutiny is beyond all conception. Thirteen of theparty who were with me had always lived forward among the seamen; yetneither they nor the messmates of Christian, Stewart, Haywood, and Young,had ever observed any circumstance that made them in the least suspectwhat was going on. To such a close-planned act of villainy, my mind beingentirely free from any suspicion, it is not wonderful that I fell asacrifice. Perhaps if there had been marines on board a sentinel at mycabin-door might have prevented it; for I slept with the door always openthat the officer of the watch might have access to me on all occasions,the possibility of such a conspiracy being ever the farthest from mythoughts. Had their mutiny been occasioned by any grievances, either realor imaginary, I must have discovered symptoms of their discontent, whichwould have put me on my guard: but the case was far otherwise. Christianin particular I was on the most friendly terms with: that very day he wasengaged to have dined with me, and the preceding night he excused himselffrom supping with me on pretence of being unwell; for which I feltconcerned, having no suspicions of his integrity and honour.CHAPTER 14.Proceed in the Launch to the Island Tofoa.Difficulty in obtaining Supplies there.Treacherous Attack of the Natives.Escape to Sea and bear away for New Holland.1789. April.My first determination was to seek a supply of breadfruit and water atTofoa, and afterwards to sail for Tongataboo, and there risk asolicitation to Poulaho the king to equip our boat and grant us a supplyof water and provisions, so as to enable us to reach the East Indies.The quantity of provisions I found in the boat was 150 pounds of bread,16 pieces of pork, each piece weighing 2 pounds, 6 quarts of rum, 6bottles of wine, with 28 gallons of water, and four empty barrecoes.Fortunately it was calm all the afternoon till about four o'clock, whenwe were so far to windward that, with a moderate easterly breeze whichsprung up, we were able to sail. It was nevertheless dark when we got toTofoa where I expected to land, but the shore proved to be so steep androcky that we were obliged to give up all thoughts of it and keep theboat under the lee of the island with two oars, for there was noanchorage. Having fixed on this mode of proceeding for the night I servedto every person half a pint of grog, and each took to his rest as well asour unhappy situation would allow.Wednesday 29.In the morning at dawn of day we rowed along shore in search of alanding-place, and about ten o'clock we discovered a cove with a stonybeach at the north-west part of the island, where I dropped the grapnelwithin 20 yards of the rocks. A great surf ran on the shore but, as I wasunwilling to diminish our stock of provisions, I landed Mr. Samuel andsome others, who climbed the cliffs and got into the country to searchfor supplies. The rest of us remained at the cove, not discovering anyother way into the country than that by which Mr. Samuel had proceeded.It was great consolation to me to find that the spirits of my people didnot sink, notwithstanding our miserable and almost hopeless situation.Towards noon Mr. Samuel returned with a few quarts of water which he hadfound in holes; but he had met with no spring or any prospect of asufficient supply in that particular, and had seen only the signs ofinhabitants. As it was uncertain what might be our future necessities Ionly issued a morsel of bread and a glass of wine to each person fordinner.I observed the latitude of this cove to be 19 degrees 41 minutes south.This is the north-west part of Tofoa, the north-westernmost of theFriendly Islands.The weather was fair but the wind blew so strong from the east-south-eastthat we could not venture to sea. Our detention made it absolutelynecessary to endeavour to obtain something towards our support; for Idetermined if possible to keep our first stock entire. We thereforeweighed and rowed along shore to see if anything could be got; and atlast discovered some coconut trees; but they were on the top of highprecipices and the surf made it dangerous landing: both one and the otherwe however got the better of. Some of the people with much difficultyclimbed the cliffs and got about 20 coconuts, and others flung them toropes, by which we hauled them through the surf into the boat. This wasall that could be done here and, as I found no place so safe as the onewe had left to spend the night at, I returned to the cove and, havingserved a coconut to each person, we went to rest again in the boat.Thursday 30.At daylight we attempted to put to sea; but the wind and weather provedso bad that I was glad to return to our former station where, afterissuing a morsel of bread and a spoonful of rum to each person, welanded, and I went off with Mr. Nelson, Mr. Samuel, and some others, intothe country, having hauled ourselves up the precipice by long vines whichwere fixed there by the natives for that purpose, this being the only wayinto the country.We found a few deserted huts and a small plantain walk but little takencare of, from which we could only collect three small bunches ofplantains. After passing this place we came to a deep gully that ledtowards a mountain near a volcano and, as I conceived that in the rainyseason very great torrents of water must pass through it, we hoped tofind sufficient for our use remaining in some holes of the rocks; butafter all our search the whole that we collected was only nine gallons.We advanced within two miles of the foot of the highest mountain in theisland, on which is the volcano that is almost constantly burning. Thecountry near it is covered with lava and has a most dreary appearance. Aswe had not been fortunate in our discoveries, and saw nothing toalleviate our distresses except the plantains and water above-mentioned,we returned to the boat exceedingly fatigued and faint. When I came tothe precipice whence we were to descend into the cove I was seized withsuch a dizziness in my head that I thought it scarce possible to effectit: however by the assistance of Nelson and others they at last got medown, in a weak condition. Every person being returned by noon I gaveabout an ounce of pork and two plantains to each, with half a glass ofwine. I again observed the latitude of this place 19 degrees 41 minutessouth. The people who remained by the boat I had directed to look forfish or what they could pick up about the rocks; but nothing eatablecould be found: so that upon the whole we considered ourselves on asmiserable a spot of land as could well be imagined.I could not say positively from the former knowledge I had of this islandwhether it was inhabited or not; but I knew it was considered inferior tothe other islands, and I was not certain but that the Indians onlyresorted to it at particular times. I was very anxious to ascertain thispoint for, in case there had been only a few people here, and those couldhave furnished us with but very moderate supplies, the remaining in thisspot to have made preparations for our voyage would have been preferableto the risk of going amongst multitudes, where perhaps we might loseeverything. A party therefore sufficiently strong I determined should goanother route as soon as the sun became lower, and they cheerfullyundertook it.About two o'clock in the afternoon the party set out but, after sufferingmuch fatigue, they returned in the evening without any kind of success.At the head of the cove about 150 yards from the waterside there was acave; the distance across the stony beach was about 100 yards, and fromthe country into the cove there was no other way than that which I havealready described. The situation secured us from the danger of beingsurprised, and I determined to remain on shore for the night with a partof my people that the others might have more room to rest in the boatwith the master, whom I directed to lie at a grapnel and be watchful incase we should be attacked. I ordered one plantain for each person to beboiled and, having supped on this scanty allowance with a quarter of apint of grog, and fixed the watches for the night, those whose turn itwas laid down to sleep in the cave, before which we kept up a good fireyet notwithstanding we were much troubled with flies and mosquitoes.May. Friday 1.At dawn of day the party set out again in a different route to see whatthey could find, in the course of which they suffered greatly for want ofwater: they however met with two men, a woman, and a child: the men camewith them to the cove and brought two coconut shells of water. Iendeavoured to make friends of these people and sent them away forbreadfruit, plantains, and water. Soon after other natives came to us;and by noon there were thirty about us, from whom we obtained a smallsupply; but I could only afford one ounce of pork and a quarter of abreadfruit to each man for dinner, with half a pint of water, for I wasfixed in my resolution not to use any of the bread or water in the boat.No particular chief was yet among the natives: they were notwithstandingtractable, and behaved honestly, exchanging the provisions they broughtfor a few buttons and beads. The party who had been out informed me oftheir having seen several neat plantations, so that it remained no longera doubt of there being settled inhabitants on the island, for whichreason I determined to get what I could, and to sail the first momentthat the wind and weather would allow us to put to sea.I was much puzzled in what manner to account to the natives for the lossof my ship: I knew they had too much sense to be amused with a story thatthe ship was to join me, when she was not in sight from the hills. I wasat first doubtful whether I should tell the real fact or say that theship had overset and sunk, and that we only were saved: the latterappeared to be the most proper and advantageous for us, and I accordinglyinstructed my people, that we might all agree in one story. As I expectedenquiries were made about the ship, and they seemed readily satisfiedwith our account; but there did not appear the least symptom of joy orsorrow in their faces, although I fancied I discovered some marks ofsurprise. Some of the natives were coming and going the whole afternoon,and we got enough of breadfruit, plantains, and coconuts for another day;but of water they only brought us about five pints. A canoe also came inwith four men and brought a few coconuts and breadfruit which I bought asI had done the rest. Nails were much enquired after, but I would notsuffer any to be shown as they were wanted for the use of the boat.Towards evening I had the satisfaction to find our stock of provisionssomewhat increased, but the natives did not appear to have much to spare.What they brought was in such small quantities that I had no reason tohope we should be able to procure from them sufficient to stock us forour voyage. At sunset all the natives left us in quiet possession of thecove. I thought this a good sign, and made no doubt that they would comeagain the next day with a better supply of food and water, with which Ihoped to sail without farther delay: for if in attempting to get toTongataboo we should be driven to leeward of the islands there would be alarger quantity of provisions to support us against such a misfortune.At night I served a quarter of a breadfruit and a coconut to each personfor supper and, a good fire being made, all but the watch went to sleep.Saturday 2.At daybreak the next morning I was pleased to find everyone's spirits alittle revived, and that they no longer regarded me with those anxiouslooks which had constantly been directed towards me since we lost sightof the ship: every countenance appeared to have a degree of cheerfulness,and they all seemed determined to do their best.As there was no certainty of our being supplied with water by the nativesI sent a party among the gullies in the mountains with empty shells tosee what could be found. In their absence the natives came about us as Iexpected, and in greater numbers; two canoes also came in from round thenorth side of the island. In one of them was an elderly chief calledMaccaackavow. Soon after some of our foraging party returned, and withthem came a good-looking chief called Egijeefow, or perhaps more properlyEefow, Egij or Eghee, signifying a chief. To each of these men I made apresent of an old shirt and a knife, and I soon found they either hadseen me or had heard of my being at Annamooka. They knew I had been withcaptain Cook, who they inquired after, and also captain Clerk. They werevery inquisitive to know in what manner I had lost my ship. During thisconversation a young man named Nageete appeared, whom I remembered tohave seen at Annamooka: he expressed much pleasure at our meeting. Ienquired after Poulaho and Feenow, who they said were at Tongataboo; andEefow agreed to accompany me thither if I would wait till the weathermoderated. The readiness and affability of this man gave me muchsatisfaction.This however was but of short duration for the natives began to increasein number and I observed some symptoms of a design against us. Soon afterthey attempted to haul the boat on shore, on which I brandished mycutlass in a threatening manner and spoke to Eefow to desire them todesist, which they did and everything became quiet again. My people whohad been in the mountains now returned with about three gallons of water.I kept buying up the little breadfruit that was brought to us, andlikewise some spears to arm my men with, having only four cutlasses, twoof which were in the boat. As we had no means of improving our situationI told our people I would wait till sunset, by which time perhapssomething might happen in our favour: for if we attempted to go atpresent we must fight our way through, which we could do moreadvantageously at night; and that in the meantime we would endeavour toget off to the boat what we had bought. The beach was lined with thenatives and we heard nothing but the knocking of stones together, whichthey had in each hand. I knew very well this was the sign of an attack.At noon I served a coconut and a breadfruit to each person for dinner,and gave some to the chiefs, with whom I continued to appear intimate andfriendly. They frequently importuned me to sit down but I as constantlyrefused: for it occurred both to Nelson and myself that the intended toseize hold of me if I gave them such an opportunity. Keeping thereforeconstantly on our guard we were suffered to eat our uncomfortable meal insome quietness.After dinner we began by little and little to get our things into theboat, which was a troublesome business on account of the surf. Icarefully watched the motions of the natives, who continued to increasein number, and found that, instead of their intention being to leave us,fires were made, and places fixed on for their stay during the night.Consultations were also held among them and everything assured me weshould be attacked. I sent orders to the master that when he saw uscoming down he should keep the boat close to the shore that we might themore readily embark.I had my journal on shore with me, writing the occurrences in the caveand in sending it down to the boat, it was nearly snatched away but forthe timely assistance of the gunner.The sun was near setting when I gave the word, on which every person whowas on shore with me boldly took up his proportion of things and carriedthem to the boat. The chiefs asked me if I would not stay with them allnight. I said: "No, I never sleep out of my boat; but in the morning wewill again trade with you, and I shall remain till the weather ismoderate that we may go, as we have agreed, to see Poulaho atTongataboo." Maccaackavow then got up and said: "You will not sleep onshore? then Mattie" (which directly signifies we will kill you) and heleft me. The onset was now preparing; everyone as I have described beforekept knocking stones together, and Eefow quitted me. All but two or threethings were in the boat, when I took Nageete by the hand, and we walkeddown the beach, everyone in a silent kind of horror.While I was seeing the people embark Nageete wanted me to stay to speakto Eefow, but I found he was encouraging them to the attack, and it wasmy determination if they had then begun to have killed him for histreacherous behaviour. I ordered the carpenter not to quit me till theother people were in the boat. Nageete, finding I would not stay, loosedhimself from my hold and went off, and we all got into the boat exceptone man who, while I was getting on board, quitted it and ran up thebeach to cast the stern fast off, notwithstanding the master and otherscalled to him to return while they were hauling me out of the water.I was no sooner in the boat than the attack began by about 200 men; theunfortunate poor man who had run up the beach was knocked down, and thestones flew like a shower of shot. Many Indians got hold of the sternrope and were near hauling the boat on shore, which they would certainlyhave effected if I had not had a knife in my pocket with which I cut therope. We then hauled off to the grapnel, everyone being more or lesshurt. At this time I saw five of the natives about the poor man they hadkilled, and two of them were beating him about the head with stones intheir hands.We had no time to reflect for to my surprise they filled their canoeswith stones, and twelve men came off after us to renew the attack, whichthey did so effectually as nearly to disable us all. Our grapnel was foulbut Providence here assisted us; the fluke broke and we got to our oarsand pulled to sea. They however could paddle round us, so that we wereobliged to sustain the attack without being able to return it, exceptwith such stones as lodged in the boat, and in this I found we were veryinferior to them. We could not close because our boat was lumbered andheavy, of which they knew how to take advantage: I therefore adopted theexpedient of throwing overboard some clothes which, as I expected, theystopped to pick up and, as it was by this time almost dark, they gaveover the attack and returned towards the shore leaving us to reflect onour unhappy situation.The poor man killed by the natives was John Norton: this was his secondvoyage with me as a quartermaster, and his worthy character made melament his loss very much. He has left an aged parent I am told, whom hesupported.I once before sustained an attack of a similar nature with a smallernumber of Europeans against a multitude of Indians: it was after thedeath of Captain Cook on the Morai at Owhyhee, where I was left byLieutenant King. Yet notwithstanding this experience I had not an ideathat the power of a man's arm could throw stones from two to eight poundsweight with such force and exactness as these people did. Here unhappilywe were without firearms, which the Indians knew; and it was a fortunatecircumstance that they did not begin to attack us in the cave; for inthat case our destruction must have been inevitable, and we should havehad nothing left for it but to sell our lives as dearly as we could, inwhich I found everyone cheerfully disposed to concur. This appearance ofresolution deterred them, supposing that they could effect their purposewithout risk after we were in the boat.Taking this as a sample of the disposition of the natives there was butlittle reason to expect much benefit by persevering in the intention ofvisiting Poulaho; for I considered their good behaviour formerly to haveproceeded from a dread of our firearms, and which therefore was likely tocease, as they knew we were now destitute of them: and even supposing ourlives not in danger the boat and everything we had would most probably betaken from us, and thereby all hopes precluded of ever being able toreturn to our native country.We set our sails and steered along shore by the west side of the islandTofoa, the wind blowing fresh from the eastward. My mind was employed inconsidering what was best to be done when I was solicited by all hands totake them towards home: and when I told them that no hopes of relief forus remained (except what might be found at New Holland) till I came toTimor, a distance of full 1200 leagues, where there was a Dutchsettlement, but in what part of the island I knew not, they all agreed tolive on one ounce of bread and a quarter of a pint of water per day.Therefore after examining our stock of provisions and recommending tothem in the most solemn manner not to depart from their promise, we boreaway across a sea where the navigation is but little known, in a smallboat twenty-three feet long from stem to stern, deep laden with eighteenmen. I was happy however to see that everyone seemed better satisfiedwith our situation than myself.Our stock of provisions consisted of about one hundred and fifty poundsof bread, twenty-eight gallons of water, twenty pounds of pork, threebottles of wine, and five quarts of rum. The difference between this andthe quantity we had on leaving the ship was principally owing to our lossin the bustle and confusion of the attack. A few coconuts were in theboat and some breadfruit, but the latter was trampled to pieces.CHAPTER 15.Passage towards New Holland.Islands discovered in our Route.Our great Distresses.See the Reefs of New Holland and find a Passage through them.1789. May.It was about eight o'clock at night when we bore away under a reefed lugfore-sail and, having divided the people into watches and got the boat ina little order, we returned God thanks for our miraculous preservationand, fully confident of his gracious support, I found my mind more atease than it had been for some time past.Sunday 3.At daybreak the gale increased; the sun rose very fiery and red, a sureindication of a severe gale of wind. At eight it blew a violent storm andthe sea ran very high, so that between the seas the sail was becalmed,and when on the top of the sea it was too much to have set: but we couldnot venture to take in the sail for we were in very imminent danger anddistress, the sea curling over the stern of the boat, which obliged us tobale with all our might. A situation more distressing has perhaps seldombeen experienced.Our bread was in bags and in danger of being spoiled by the wet: to bestarved to death was inevitable if this could not be prevented: Itherefore began to examine what clothes there were in the boat and whatother things could be spared and, having determined that only two suitsshould be kept for each person, the rest was thrown overboard with somerope and spare sails, which lightened the boat considerably, and we hadmore room to bale the water out. Fortunately the carpenter had a goodchest in the boat, in which we secured the bread the first favourablemoment. His tool chest also was cleared and the tools stowed in thebottom of the boat so that this became a second convenience.I served a teaspoonful of rum to each person (for we were very wet andcold) with a quarter of a breadfruit, which was scarce eatable, fordinner: our engagement was now strictly to be carried into execution, andI was fully determined to make our provisions last eight weeks, let thedaily proportion be ever so small.At noon I considered our course and distance from Tofoa to bewest-north-west three-quarters west 86 miles, latitude 19 degrees 27minutes south. I directed the course to the west-north-west that we mightget a sight of the islands called Feejee if they laid in the directionthe natives had pointed out to me.The weather continued very severe, the wind veering from north-east toeast-south-east. The sea ran higher than in the forenoon, and the fatigueof baling to keep the boat from filling was exceedingly great. We coulddo nothing more than keep before the sea, in the course of which the boatperformed so well that I no longer dreaded any danger in that respect.But, among the hardships we were to undergo, that of being constantly wetwas not the least.Monday 4.The night was very cold and at daylight our limbs were so benumbed thatwe could scarce find the use of them. At this time I served a teaspoonfulof rum to each person, from which we all found great benefit.As I have mentioned before I determined to keep to the west-north-westtill I got more to the northward, for I not only expected to have betterweather but to see the Feejee Islands, as I have often understood fromthe natives of Annamooka that they lie in that direction. Captain Cooklikewise considered them to be north-west by west from Tongataboo. Justbefore noon we discovered a small flat island of a moderate heightbearing west-south-west 4 or 5 leagues. I observed our latitude to be 18degrees 58 minutes south; our longitude was by account 3 degrees 4minutes west from the island of Tofoa, having made a north 72 degreeswest course, distance 95 miles, since yesterday noon. I divided fivesmall coconuts for our dinner and everyone was satisfied.A little after noon other islands appeared, and at a quarter past threeo'clock we could count eight, bearing from south round by the west tonorth-west by north, those to the south which were the nearest being fourleagues distant from us.I kept my course to the north-west by west between the islands, the galehaving considerably abated. At six o'clock we discovered three othersmall islands to the north-west, the westernmost of them bore north-westhalf west 7 leagues. I steered to the southward of these islands awest-north-west course for the night under a reefed sail.Served a few broken pieces of breadfruit for supper and performedprayers.The night turned out fair and, having had tolerable rest, everyone seemedconsiderably better in the morning, and contentedly breakfasted on a fewpieces of yams that were found in the boat. After breakfast we examinedour bread, a great deal of which was damaged and rotten; thisnevertheless we were glad to keep for use.I had hitherto been scarcely able to keep any account of our run, but wenow equipped ourselves a little better by getting a log-line marked and,having practised at counting seconds, several could do it with somedegree of exactness.The islands we had passed lie between the latitude of 19 degrees 5minutes south and 18 degrees 19 minutes south, and according to myreckoning from 3 degrees 17 minutes to 3 degrees 46 minutes westlongitude from the island Tofoa: the largest may be about six leagues incircuit; but it is impossible for me to be very correct. To show wherethey are to be found again is the most my situation enabled me to do. Thesketch I have made will give a comparative view of their extent. Ibelieve all the larger islands are inhabited as they appeared veryfertile.At noon I observed in latitude 18 degrees 10 seconds south and consideredmy course and distance from yesterday noon north-west by west half west94 miles; longitude by account from Tofoa 4 degrees 29 minutes west.For dinner I served some of the damaged bread and a quarter of a pint ofwater.About six o'clock in the afternoon we discovered two islands, one bearingwest by south 6 leagues and the other north-west by north 8 leagues; Ikept to windward of the northernmost and, passing it by 10 o'clock, Iresumed our course to the north-west and west-north-west for the night.Wednesday 6.The weather was fair and the wind moderate all day from theeast-north-east. At daylight a number of other islands were in sight fromsouth-south-east to the west and round to north-east by east; betweenthose in the north-west I determined to pass. At noon a small sandyisland or key two miles distant from me bore from east to souththree-quarters west. I had passed ten islands, the largest of which Ijudged to be 6 or 8 leagues in circuit. Much larger lands appeared in thesouth-west and north-north-west, between which I directed my course.Latitude observed 17 degrees 17 minutes south; course since yesterdaynoon north 50 degrees west; distance 84 miles; longitude made by account5 degrees 37 minutes west.Our allowance for the day was a quarter of a pint of coconut milk and themeat, which did not exceed two ounces to each person: it was receivedvery contentedly but we suffered great drought. I durst not venture toland as we had no arms and were less capable of defending ourselves thanwe were at Tofoa.To keep an account of the boat's run was rendered difficult from beingconstantly wet with the sea breaking over us but, as we advanced towardsthe land, the sea became smoother and I was enabled to form a sketch ofthe islands which will serve to give a general knowledge of their extentand position. Those we were near appeared fruitful and hilly, some verymountainous and all of a good height.To our great joy we hooked a fish, but we were miserably disappointed byits being lost in trying to get it into the boat.We continued steering to the north-west between the islands which by theevening appeared of considerable extent, woody and mountainous. At sunsetthe southernmost bore from south to south-west by west and thenorthernmost from north by west half west to north-east half east. At sixo'clock we were nearly midway between them and about 6 leagues distantfrom each shore when we fell in with a coral bank, on which we had onlyfour feet water, without the least break on it or ruffle of the sea togive us warning. I could see that it extended about a mile on each sideof us, but as it is probable that it may extend much further I have laidit down so in my sketch.I directed the course west by north for the night, and served to eachperson an ounce of the damaged bread and a quarter of a pint of water forsupper.As our lodgings were very miserable and confined for want of room Iendeavoured to remedy the latter defect by putting ourselves at watch andwatch; so that one half always sat up while the other lay down on theboat's bottom or upon a chest, with nothing to cover us but the heavens.Our limbs were dreadfully cramped for we could not stretch them out, andthe nights were so cold, and we so constantly wet, that after a few hourssleep we could scarce move.Thursday 7.At dawn of day we again discovered land from west-south-west towest-north-west, and another island north-north-west, the latter a highround lump of but little extent: the southern land that we had passed inthe night was still in sight. Being very wet and cold I served a spoonfulof rum and a morsel of bread for breakfast.The land in the west was distinguished by some extraordinary high rockswhich, as we approached them, assumed a variety of forms. The countryappeared to be agreeably interspersed with high and low land, and in someplaces covered with wood. Off the north-east part lay some small rockyislands, between which and an island 4 leagues to the north-east Idirected my course; but a lee current very unexpectedly set us very nearto the rocky isles, and we could only get clear of it by rowing, passingclose to the reef that surrounded them. At this time we observed twolarge sailing canoes coming swiftly after us along shore and, beingapprehensive of their intentions, we rowed with some anxiety, fullysensible of our weak and defenceless state. At noon it was calm and theweather cloudy; my latitude is therefore doubtful to 3 or 4 miles. Ourcourse since yesterday noon north-west by west, distance 79 miles;latitude by account 16 degrees 29 minutes south, and longitude by accountfrom Tofoa 6 degrees 46 minutes west. Being constantly wet it was withthe utmost difficulty I could open a book to write, and I am sensiblethat what I have done can only serve to point out where these lands areto be found again, and give an idea of their extent.All the afternoon we had light winds at north-north-east: the weather wasvery rainy, attended with thunder and lightning. Only one of the canoesgained upon us, which by three o'clock in the afternoon was not more thantwo miles off, when she gave over chase.If I may judge from the sail of these vessels they are of a similarconstruction with those at the Friendly Islands which, with the nearnessof their situation, gives reason to believe that they are the same kindof people. Whether these canoes had any hostile intention against us mustremain a doubt: perhaps we might have benefited by an intercourse withthem, but in our defenceless situation to have made the experiment wouldhave been risking too much.I imagine these to be the islands called Feejee as their extent,direction, and distance from the Friendly Islands answers to thedescription given of them by those Islanders. Heavy rain came on at fouro'clock, when every person did their utmost to catch some water, and weincreased our stock to 34 gallons, besides quenching our thirst for thefirst time since we had been at sea; but an attendant consequence made uspass the night very miserably for, being extremely wet and having no drythings to shift or cover us, we experienced cold and shiverings scarce tobe conceived. Most fortunately for us the forenoon turned out fair and westripped and dried our clothes. The allowance I issued today was an ounceand a half of pork, a teaspoonful of rum, half a pint of coconut milk,and an ounce of bread. The rum though so small in quantity was of thegreatest service. A fishing-line was generally towing from the stern ofthe boat but though we saw great numbers of fish we could never catchone.At noon I observed in latitude 16 degrees 4 minutes south and found wehad made a course from yesterday noon north 62 degrees west distance 62miles; longitude by account from Tofoa 7 degrees 42 minutes west.The land passed yesterday and the day before is a group of islands, 14 or16 in number, lying between the latitude of 16 degrees 26 minutes southand 17 degrees 57 minutes south, and in longitude by my account 4 degrees47 minutes to 7 degrees 17 minutes west from Tofoa. Three of theseislands are very large, having from 30 to 40 leagues of sea-coast.In the afternoon we cleaned out the boat and it employed us till sunsetto get everything dry and in order. Hitherto I had issued the allowanceby guess, but I now made a pair of scales with two coconut shells and,having accidentally some pistol-balls in the boat, 25 of which weighedone pound or 16 ounces, I adopted one,* as the proportion of weight thateach person should receive of bread at the times I served it. I alsoamused all hands with describing the situation of New Guinea and NewHolland, and gave them every information in my power that in case anyaccident happened to me those who survived might have some idea of whatthey were about, and be able to find their way to Timor, which at presentthey knew nothing of more than the name and some not even that. At nightI served a quarter of a pint of water and half an ounce of bread forsupper.(*Footnote. It weighed 272 grains.)Saturday 9.In the morning a quarter of a pint of coconut milk and some of thedecayed bread was served for breakfast, and for dinner I divided the meatof four coconuts with the remainder of the rotten bread, which was onlyeatable by such distressed people.At noon I observed the latitude to be 15 degrees 47 minutes south; coursesince yesterday north 75 degrees west distance 64 miles; longitude madeby account 8 degrees 45 minutes west.In the afternoon I fitted a pair of shrouds for each mast, and contriveda canvas weather cloth round the boat, and raised the quarters about nineinches by nailing on the seats of the stern sheets, which proved of greatbenefit to us.The wind had been moderate all day in the south-east quarter with fineweather; but about nine o'clock in the evening the clouds began togather, and we had a prodigious fall of rain with severe thunder andlightning. By midnight we caught about twenty gallons of water. Beingmiserably wet and cold I served to the people a teaspoonful of rum eachto enable them to bear with their distressed situation. The weathercontinued extremely bad and the wind increased; we spent a very miserablenight without sleep except such as could be got in the midst of rain. Theday brought no relief but its light. The sea broke over us so much thattwo men were constantly baling; and we had no choice how to steer, beingobliged to keep before the waves for fear of the boat filling.The allowance now regularly served to each person was one 25th of a poundof bread and a quarter of a pint of water, at eight in the morning, atnoon, and at sunset. Today I gave about half an ounce of pork for dinnerwhich, though any moderate person would have considered only as amouthful, was divided into three or four.The rain abated towards noon and I observed the latitude to be 15 degrees17 minutes south; course north 67 degrees west distance 78 miles;longitude made 10 degrees west.The wind continued strong from south-south-east to south-east with verysqually weather and a high breaking sea, so that we were miserably wetand suffered great cold in the night.Monday 11.In the morning at daybreak I served to every person a teaspoonful of rum,our limbs being so cramped that we could scarce move them. Our situationwas now extremely dangerous, the sea frequently running over our stern,which kept us baling with all our strength.At noon the sun appeared, which gave us as much pleasure as in a winter'sday in England. I issued the 25th of a pound of bread and a quarter of apint of water, as yesterday. Latitude observed 14 degrees 50 minutessouth; course north 71 degrees west distance 102 miles; and longitude byaccount 11 degrees 39 minutes west from Tofoa.In the evening it rained hard and we again experienced a dreadful night.Tuesday 12.At length the day came and showed to me a miserable set of beings, fullof wants, without anything to relieve them. Some complained of great painin their bowels, and everyone of having almost lost the use of his limbs.The little sleep we got was no ways refreshing as we were covered withsea and rain. I served a spoonful of rum at day-dawn, and the usualallowance of bread and water for breakfast, dinner, and supper.At noon it was almost calm, no sun to be seen, and some of us shiveringwith cold. Course since yesterday west by north distance 89 miles;latitude by account 14 degrees 33 minutes south; longitude made 13degrees 9 minutes west. The direction of our course was to pass to thenorthward of the New Hebrides.The wet weather continued and in the afternoon the wind came from thesouthward, blowing fresh in squalls. As there was no prospect of gettingour clothes dried I recommended to everyone to strip and wring themthrough the salt water, by which means they received a warmth that whilewet with rain they could not have.This afternoon we saw a kind of fruit on the water which Nelson told mewas the Barringtonia of Forster and, as I saw the same again in themorning, and some men-of-war birds, I was led to believe that we were notfar from land.We continued constantly shipping seas and baling, and were very wet andcold in the night; but I could not afford the allowance of rum atdaybreak.Wednesday 13.At noon I had a sight of the sun, latitude 14 degrees 17 minutes south.Course west by north 79 miles; longitude made 14 degrees 28 minutes west.All this day we were constantly shipping water and suffered much cold andshiverings in the night.Thursday 14.Fresh gales at south-east and gloomy weather with rain and a high sea. Atsix in the morning we saw land from south-west by south eight leagues tonorth-west by west three-quarters west six leagues, which soon afterappeared to be four islands, one of them much larger than the others, andall of them high and remarkable. At noon we discovered a small island andsome rocks bearing north-west by north four leagues, and another islandwest eight leagues, so that the whole were six in number; the four I hadfirst seen bearing from south half east to south-west by south; ourdistance three leagues from the nearest island. My latitude observed was13 degrees 29 minutes south, and longitude by account from Tofoa 15degrees 49 minutes west; course since yesterday noon north 63 degreeswest distance 89 miles. At four in the afternoon we passed thewesternmost island.Friday 15.At one in the morning another island was discovered bearingwest-north-west five leagues distance, and at eight o'clock we saw it forthe last time bearing north-east seven leagues. A number of gannets,boobies, and men-of-war birds were seen.These islands lie between the latitude of 13 degrees 16 minutes and 14degrees 10 minutes south: their longitude according to my reckoning 15degrees 51 minutes to 17 degrees 6 minutes west from the island Tofoa.*The largest island I judged to be about twenty leagues in circuit, theothers five or six. The easternmost is the smallest island and mostremarkable, having a high sugar loaf hill.(*Footnote. By making a proportional allowance for the error afterwardsfound in the dead reckoning I estimate the longitude of these islands tobe from 167 degrees 17 minutes east to 168 degrees 34 minutes east fromGreenwich.)The sight of these islands served only to increase the misery of oursituation. We were very little better than starving with plenty in view;yet to attempt procuring any relief was attended with so much danger thatprolonging of life, even in the midst of misery, was thought preferable,while there remained hopes of being able to surmount our hardships. Formy own part I consider the general run of cloudy and wet weather to be ablessing of Providence. Hot weather would have caused us to have diedwith thirst; and probably being so constantly covered with rain or seaprotected us from that dreadful calamity.As I had nothing to assist my memory I could not then determine whetherthese islands were a part of the New Hebrides or not: I believe them tobe a new discovery which I have since found true but, though they werenot seen either by Monsieur Bougainville or Captain Cook, they are sonearly in the neighbourhood of the New Hebrides that they must beconsidered as part of the same group. They are fertile and inhabited, asI saw smoke in several places.The wind was at south-east with rainy weather all day. The night was verydark, not a star could be seen to steer by, and the sea broke continuallyover us. I found it necessary to counteract as much as possible theeffect of the southerly winds to prevent being driven too near NewGuinea, for in general we were forced to keep so much before the sea thatif we had not, at intervals of moderate weather, steered a more southerlycourse we should inevitably from a continuance of the gales have beenthrown in sight of that coast: in which case there would most probablyhave been an end to our voyage.Saturday 16.In addition to our miserable allowance of one 25th of a pound of breadand a quarter of a pint of water I issued for dinner about an ounce ofsalt pork to each person. I was often solicited for this pork, but Iconsidered it more proper to issue it in small quantities than to sufferit to be all used at once or twice, which would have been done if I hadallowed it.At noon I observed in 13 degrees 33 minutes south, longitude made fromTofoa 19 degrees 27 minutes west; course north 82 degrees west, distance101 miles. The sun breaking out through the clouds gave us hopes ofdrying our wet clothes, but the sunshine was of short duration. We hadstrong breezes at south-east by south and dark gloomy weather with stormsof thunder, lightning, and rain. The night was truly horrible, and not astar to be seen; so that our steerage was uncertain.Sunday 17.At dawn of day I found every person complaining, and some of themsolicited extra allowance, which I positively refused. Our situation wasmiserable: always wet, and suffering extreme cold in the night withoutthe least shelter from the weather. Being constantly obliged to bale tokeep the boat from filling was perhaps not to be reckoned an evil as itgave us exercise.The little rum we had was of great service: when our nights wereparticularly distressing I generally served a teaspoonful or two to eachperson: and it was always joyful tidings when they heard of myintentions.At noon a water-spout was very near on board of us. I issued an ounce ofpork in addition to the allowance of bread and water; but before we beganto eat every person stripped and, having wrung their clothes through theseawater, found much warmth and refreshment. Course since yesterday noonwest-south-west distance 100 miles; latitude by account 14 degrees 11minutes south and longitude made 21 degrees 3 minutes west.The night was dark and dismal: the sea constantly breaking over us andnothing but the wind and waves to direct our steerage. It was myintention if possible to make New Holland to the southward of Endeavourstraits, being sensible that it was necessary to preserve such asituation as would make a southerly wind a fair one, that we might rangealong the reefs till an opening should be found into smooth water, and wethe sooner be able to pick up some refreshments.Monday 18.In the morning the rain abated, when we stripped and wrung our clothesthrough the seawater as usual, which refreshed us greatly. Every personcomplained of violent pain in their bones; I was only surprised that noone was yet laid up. The customary allowance of one 25th of a pound ofbread and a quarter of a pint of water was served at breakfast, dinner,and supper.At noon I deduced my situation by account, for we had no glimpse of thesun, to be in latitude 14 degrees 52 minutes south; course sinceyesterday noon west-south-west 106 miles; longitude made from Tofoa 22degrees 45 minutes west. Saw many boobies and noddies, a sign of being inthe neighbourhood of land. In the night we had very severe lightning withheavy rain and were obliged to keep baling without intermission.Tuesday 19.Very bad weather and constant rain. At noon latitude by account 14degrees 37 minutes south; course since yesterday north 81 degrees west,distance 100 miles; longitude made 24 degrees 30 minutes west. With theallowance of bread and water served half an ounce of pork to each personfor dinner.Wednesday 20.Fresh breezes east-north-east with constant rain, at times a deluge.Always baling.At dawn of day some of my people seemed half dead: our appearances werehorrible, and I could look no way but I caught the eye of someone indistress. Extreme hunger was now too evident, but no one suffered fromthirst, nor had we much inclination to drink, that desire perhaps beingsatisfied through the skin. The little sleep we got was in the midst ofwater, and we constantly awoke with severe cramps and pains in our bones.This morning I served about two teaspoonfuls of rum to each person andthe allowance of bread and water as usual. At noon the sun broke out andrevived everyone. I found we were in latitude 14 degrees 49 minutessouth; longitude made 25 degrees 46 minutes west; course south 88 degreeswest distance 75 miles.All the afternoon we were so covered with rain and salt water that wecould scarcely see. We suffered extreme cold and everyone dreaded theapproach of night. Sleep, though we longed for it, afforded no comfort:for my own part I almost lived without it.Thursday 21.About two o'clock in the morning we were overwhelmed with a deluge ofrain. It fell so heavy that we were afraid it would fill the boat, andwere obliged to bale with all our might. At dawn of day I served a largerallowance of rum. Towards noon the rain abated and the sun shone, but wewere miserably cold and wet, the sea breaking constantly over us so that,notwithstanding the heavy rain, we had not been able to add to our stockof fresh water. Latitude by observation 14 degrees 29 minutes south, andlongitude made by account from Tofoa 27 degrees 25 minutes west; coursesince yesterday noon north 78 degrees west 99 miles. I now consideredmyself nearly on a meridian with the east part of New Guinea.Friday 22.Strong gales from east-south-east to south-south-east, a high sea, anddark dismal night.Our situation this day was extremely calamitous. We were obliged to takethe course of the sea, running right before it and watching with theutmost care as the least error in the helm would in a moment have beenour destruction.At noon it blew very hard and the foam of the sea kept running over ourstern and quarters; I however got propped up and made an observation ofthe latitude in 14 degrees 17 minutes south; course north 85 degrees westdistance 130 miles; longitude made 29 degrees 38 minutes west.The misery we suffered this night exceeded the preceding. The sea flewover us with great force and kept us baling with horror and anxiety.Saturday 23.At dawn of day I found everyone in a most distressed condition, and Ibegan to fear that another such night would put an end to the lives ofseveral who seemed no longer able to support their sufferings. I servedan allowance of two teaspoonfuls of rum, after drinking which, havingwrung our clothes and taken our breakfast of bread and water, we became alittle refreshed.Towards noon the weather became fair, but with very little abatement ofthe gale and the sea remained equally high. With some difficulty Iobserved the latitude to be 13 degrees 44 minutes south: course sinceyesterday noon north 74 degrees west, distance 116 miles; longitude made31 degrees 32 minutes west from Tofoa.The wind moderated in the evening and the weather looked much better,which rejoiced all hands so that they ate their scanty allowance withmore satisfaction than for some time past. The night also was fair but,being always wet with the sea, we suffered much from the cold.Sunday 24.A fine morning, I had the pleasure to see, produced some cheerfulcountenances and, the first time for 15 days past, we experienced comfortfrom the warmth of the sun. We stripped and hung our clothes up to dry,which were by this time become so threadbare that they would not keep outeither wet or cold.At noon I observed in latitude 13 degrees 33 minutes south; longitude byaccount from Tofoa 33 degrees 28 minutes west; course north 84 degreeswest, distance 114 miles. With the usual allowance of bread and water fordinner I served an ounce of pork to each person. This afternoon we hadmany birds about us which are never seen far from land, such as boobiesand noddies.ALLOWANCE LESSENED.As the sea began to run fair, and we shipped but little water, I took theopportunity to examine into the state of our bread and found that,according to the present mode of issuing, there was a sufficient quantityremaining for 29 days allowance, by which time I hoped we should be ableto reach Timor. But as this was very uncertain and it was possible that,after all, we might be obliged to go to Java, I determined to proportionthe allowance so as to make our stock hold out six weeks. I wasapprehensive that this would be ill received, and that it would requiremy utmost resolution to enforce it for, small as the quantity was which Iintended to take away for our future good, yet it might appear to mypeople like robbing them of life, and some, who were less patient thantheir companions, I expected would very ill brook it. However on myrepresenting the necessity of guarding against delays that might beoccasioned in our voyage by contrary winds, or other causes, andpromising to enlarge upon the allowance as we got on, they cheerfullyagreed to my proposal. It was accordingly settled that every personshould receive one 25th of a pound of bread for breakfast, and the samequantity for dinner, so that by omitting the proportion for supper, wehad 43 days allowance.Monday 25.At noon some noddies came so near to us that one of them was caught byhand. This bird was about the size of a small pigeon. I divided it withits entrails into 18 portions, and by a well-known method at sea of Whoshall have this?* it was distributed with the allowance of bread andwater for dinner, and ate up bones and all, with salt water for sauce. Iobserved the latitude 13 degrees 32 minutes south; longitude made 35degrees 19 minutes west; course north 89 degrees west, distance 108miles.(*Footnote. One person turns his back on the object that is to bedivided: another then points separately to the portions, and each of themasking aloud, "Who shall have this?" to which the first answers by namingsomebody. This impartial method of division gives every man an equalchance of the best share.)In the evening several boobies flying very near to us we had the goodfortune to catch one of them. This bird is as large as a duck: like thenoddy it has received its name from seamen for suffering itself to becaught on the masts and yards of ships. They are the most presumptiveproofs of being in the neighbourhood of land of any seafowl we areacquainted with. I directed the bird to be killed for supper, and theblood to be given to three of the people who were the most distressed forwant of food. The body, with the entrails, beak, and feet, I divided into18 shares, and with an allowance of bread, which I made a merit ofgranting, we made a good supper, compared with our usual fare.Tuesday 26.Fresh breezes from the south-east with fine weather. In the morning wecaught another booby so that Providence appeared to be relieving ourwants in an extraordinary manner. Towards noon we passed a great manypieces of the branches of trees, some of which appeared to have been nolong time in the water. I had a good observation for the latitude, andfound our situation to be in 13 degrees 41 minutes south; longitude byaccount from Tofoa 37 degrees 13 minutes west; course south 85 degreeswest, 112 miles. The people were overjoyed at the addition to theirdinner which was distributed in the same manner as on the precedingevening, giving the blood to those who were the most in want of food.To make the bread a little savoury most of the people frequently dippedit in salt water; but I generally broke mine into small pieces and ate itin my allowance of water, out of a coconut shell with a spoon,economically avoiding to take too large a piece at a time, so that I wasas long at dinner as if it had been a much more plentiful meal.The weather was now serene, which nevertheless was not without itsinconveniences, for we began to feel distress of a different kind fromthat which we had lately been accustomed to suffer. The heat of the sunwas so powerful that several of the people were seized with a languor andfaintness which made life indifferent. We were so fortunate as to catchtwo boobies in the evening: their stomachs contained several flying-fishand small cuttlefish, all of which I saved to be divided for dinner thenext day.Wednesday 27.A fresh breeze at east-south-east with fair weather. We passed muchdriftwood this forenoon and saw many birds; I therefore did not hesitateto pronounce that we were near the reefs of New Holland. From myrecollection of Captain Cook's survey of this coast I considered thedirection of it to be north-west, and I was therefore satisfied that,with the wind to the southward of east, I could always clear any dangers.At noon I observed in latitude 13 degrees 26 minutes south; course sinceyesterday north 82 degrees west, distance 109 miles; longitude made 39degrees 4 minutes. After writing my account I divided the two birds withtheir entrails and the contents of their maws into 18 portions and, asthe prize was a very valuable one it was divided as before, by callingout Who shall have this? so that today, with the allowance of a 25th of apound of bread at breakfast, and another at dinner, with the proportionof water, I was happy to see that every person thought he had feasted.In the evening we saw a gannet; and the clouds remained so fixed in thewest that I had little doubt of our being near the land. The people,after taking their allowance of water for supper, amused themselves withconversing on the probability of what we should find.Thursday 28.At one in the morning the person at the helm heard the sound of breakers,and I no sooner lifted up my head than I saw them close under our lee,not more than a quarter of a mile distant from us. I immediately hauledon a wind to the north-north-east and in ten minutes time we couldneither see nor hear them.I have already mentioned my reason for making New Holland so far to thesouthward: for I never doubted of numerous openings in the reef throughwhich I could have access to the shore and, knowing the inclination ofthe coast to be to the north-west and the wind mostly to the southward ofeast, I could with ease range such a barrier of reefs till I should finda passage, which now became absolutely necessary, without a moment's lossof time. The idea of getting into smooth water and finding refreshmentskept my people's spirits up: their joy was very great after we had gotclear of the breakers to which we had approached much nearer than Ithought was possible, without first discovering them.Friday 29.In the morning at daylight, we could see nothing of the land or of thereefs. We bore away again and at nine o'clock saw the reefs. The seabroke furiously over every part, and we had no sooner got near to themthan the wind came at east, so that we could only lie along the line ofthe breakers, within which we saw the water so smooth that every personalready anticipated the heart-felt satisfaction he should receive as soonas we could get within them. I now found we were embayed for we could notlie clear with the sails, the wind having backed against us; and the seaset in so heavy towards the reef that our situation was become unsafe. Wecould effect but little with the oars, having scarce strength to pullthem, and I began to apprehend that we should be obliged to attemptpushing over the reef. Even this I did not despair of effecting withsuccess when happily we discovered a break in the reef, about one milefrom us, and at the same time an island of a moderate height within it,nearly in the same direction, bearing west half north. I entered thepassage with a strong stream running to the westward and found it about aquarter of a mile broad, with every appearance of deep water.On the outside the reef inclined to the north-east for a few miles, andfrom thence to the north-west: on the south side of the entrance itinclined to the south-south-west as far as I could see it, and Iconjecture that a similar passage to this which we now entered may befound near the breakers that I first discovered which are 23 miles southof this channel.I did not recollect what latitude Providential channel* lies in, but Iconsidered it to be within a few miles of this, which is situate in 12degrees 51 minutes south latitude.(*Footnote. Providential Channel is laid down by Captain Cook in 12degrees 34 minutes south, longitude 143 degrees 33 minutes east.)Being now happily within the reefs and in smooth water I endeavoured tokeep near them to try for fish, but the tide set us to the north-west, Itherefore bore away in that direction and, having promised to land on thefirst convenient spot we could find, all our past hardships seemedalready to be forgotten.At noon I had a good observation by which our latitude was 12 degrees 46minutes south, whence the foregoing situations may be considered asdetermined with some exactness. The island first seen borewest-south-west five leagues. This, which I have called the islandDirection, will in fair weather always show the channel, from which itbears due west, and may be seen as soon as the reefs from a ship'smasthead: it lies in the latitude of 12 degrees 51 minutes south. Thesehowever are marks too small for a ship to hit unless it can hereafter beascertained that passages through the reef are numerous along the coastwhich I am inclined to think they are, in which case there would belittle risk even if the wind was directly on the shore.My longitude made by dead reckoning from the island Tofoa to our passagethrough the reef is 40 degrees 10 minutes west. Providential channel, Iimagine, must lie very nearly under the same meridian with our passage,by which it appears we had out-run our reckoning 1 degree 9 minutes.We now returned God thanks for his gracious protection, and with muchcontent took our miserable allowance of a 25th of a pound of bread and aquarter of a pint of water for dinner.CHAPTER 16.Progress to the Northward along the Coast of New Holland.Land on different Islands in search of Supplies.May 1789.As we advanced within the reefs the coast began to show itself verydistinctly in a variety of high and low land, some parts of which werecovered with wood. In our way towards the shore we fell in with a pointof a reef which is connected with that towards the sea, and here we cameto a grapnel and tried to catch fish but had no success. The islandDirection at this time bore south three or four leagues. Two islands layabout four miles to the west by north, and appeared eligible for aresting-place, if for nothing more; but on our approach to the nearestisland it proved to be only a heap of stones, and its size tooinconsiderable to shelter the boat. We therefore proceeded to the next,which was close to it and towards the main. On the north-west side ofthis I found a bay and a fine sandy point to land at. Our distance wasabout a quarter of a mile from a projecting part of the main, which borefrom south-west by south to north-north-west three-quarters west. Welanded to examine if there were any signs of the natives being near us:we saw some old fireplaces but nothing to make me apprehend that thiswould be an unsafe situation for the night. Everyone was anxious to findsomething to eat, and it was soon discovered that there were oysters onthe rocks for the tide was out; but it was nearly dark and only a fewcould be gathered. I determined therefore to wait till the morning, whenI should better know how to proceed, and I directed that one half of ourcompany should sleep on shore and the other half in the boat. We wouldgladly have made a fire but, as we could not accomplish it, we took ourrest for the night, which happily was calm and undisturbed.Friday 29.The dawn of day brought greater strength and spirits to us than Iexpected for, notwithstanding everyone was very weak, there appearedstrength sufficient remaining to make me conceive the most favourablehopes of our being able to surmount the difficulties we might yet have toencounter.As there were no appearances to make me imagine that any of the nativeswere near us I sent out parties in search of supplies, while others ofthe people were putting the boat in order that we might be ready to go tosea, in case any unforeseen cause should make it necessary. One of thegudgeons of the rudder had come out in the course of the night and waslost. This, if it had happened at sea, might have been attended with themost serious consequences, as the management of the boat could not havebeen so nicely preserved as these very heavy seas required. I had beenapprehensive of this accident, and had in some measure prepared for it,by having grummets fixed on each quarter of the boat for oars; but ourutmost readiness in using them would not probably have saved us. Itappears therefore a providential circumstance that it happened in a placeof safety, and that it was in our power to remedy the defect; for bygreat good luck we found a large staple in the boat, which answered thepurpose.The parties returned, highly rejoiced at having found plenty of oystersand fresh water. I had also made a fire by the help of a small magnifyingglass and, what was still more fortunate, we found among the few thingswhich had been thrown into the boat and saved a piece of brimstone and atinderbox, so that I secured fire for the future.One of the people had been so provident as to bring away with him fromthe ship a copper pot: by being in possession of this article we wereenabled to make a proper use of the supply we now obtained for, with amixture of bread and a little pork, we made a stew that might have beenrelished by people of far more delicate appetites, and of which eachperson received a full pint.The general complaints of disease among us were a dizziness in the head,great weakness of the joints, and violent tenesmus, most of us having hadno evacuation by stool since we left the ship. I had constantly a severepain at my stomach but none of our complaints were alarming: on thecontrary, everyone retained marks of strength that, with a mind possessedof a tolerable share of fortitude, seemed able to bear more fatigue thanI imagined we should have to undergo in our voyage to Timor.As I would not allow the people to expose themselves to the heat of thesun, it being near noon, everyone took his allotment of earth where itwas shaded by the bushes for a short sleep.The oysters which we found grew so fast to the rocks that it was withdifficulty they could be broken off, and at length we discovered it to bethe most expeditious way to open them where they were fixed. They were ofa good size, and well tasted. To add to this happy circumstance in thehollow of the land there grew some wire-grass, which indicated a moistsituation. On forcing a stick, about three feet long, into the ground wefound water, and with little trouble dug a well which produced as much asour occasions required. It was very good, but I could not determine if itwas a spring or not. We were not obliged to make the well deep for itflowed as fast as we emptied it, which, as the soil was apparently tooloose to retain water from the rains, renders it probable to be a spring.On the south side of the island likewise we found a small run of goodwater.Besides places where fires had been made there were other signs of thenatives sometimes resorting to this island. I saw two ill-constructedhuts or wigwams which had only one side loosely covered, and a pointedstick was found, about three feet long, with a slit in the end of it tosling stones with, the same as the natives of Van Diemen's land use.The track of some animal was very discernible and Nelson agreed with methat it was the kangaroo; but whether these animals swim over from themainland, or are brought here by the natives to breed, it is impossibleto determine. The latter is not improbable as they may be taken with lessdifficulty in a confined spot like this than on the continent.The island is about a league in circuit: it is a high lump of rocks andstones covered with wood; but the trees are small, the soil, which isvery indifferent and sandy, being barely sufficient to produce them. Thetrees that came within our knowledge were the manchineal and a species ofpurow; also some palm trees, the tops of which we cut down, and the softinterior part or heart of them was so palatable that it made a goodaddition to our mess. Nelson discovered some fern-roots which I thoughtmight be good roasted as a substitute for bread, but in this I wasmistaken: it however was very serviceable in its natural state to allaythirst, and on that account I directed a quantity to be collected to takeinto the boat. Many pieces of coconut shells and husk were found aboutthe shore, but we could find no coconut trees, neither did I see any onthe main.I had cautioned the people not to touch any kind of berry or fruit thatthey might find; yet they were no sooner out of my sight than they beganto make free with three different kinds that grew all over the island,eating without any reserve. The symptoms of having eaten too much beganat last to frighten some of them but, on questioning others who had takena more moderate allowance, their minds were a little quieted. The othershowever became equally alarmed in their turn, dreading that such symptomswould come on, and that they were all poisoned, so that they regardedeach other with the strongest marks of apprehension, uncertain what wouldbe the issue of their imprudence. Fortunately the fruit proved wholesomeand good. One sort grew on a small delicate kind of vine; they were thesize of a large gooseberry and very like in substance, but had only asweet taste; the skin was a pale red, streaked with yellow the long wayof the fruit: it was pleasant and agreeable. Another kind grew on busheslike that which is called the seaside grape in the West Indies, but thefruit was very different, being more like elderberries, and grew inclusters in the same manner. The third sort was a blackberry; this wasnot in such plenty as the others and resembled a bullace, or large kindof sloe, both in size and taste. When I saw that these fruits were eatenby the birds I no longer doubted of their being wholesome, and those whohad already tried the experiment, not finding any bad effect, made it acertainty that we might eat of them without danger.Wild pigeons, parrots, and other birds were about the summit of theisland but, having no firearms, relief of that kind was not to beexpected unless we should find some unfrequented spot where the birdswere so tame that we might take them with our hands.The shore of this island is very rocky except the place at which welanded, and here I picked up many pieces of pumice-stone. On the part ofthe main nearest to us were several sandy bays which at low water becamean extensive rocky flat. The country had rather a barren appearanceexcept in a few places where it was covered with wood. A remarkable rangeof rocks lay a few miles to the south-west, and a high peaked hill seemedto terminate the coast towards the sea, with islands to the southward. Ahigh fair cape showed the direction of the coast to the north-west aboutseven leagues distant; and two small isles lay three or four leagues tothe northward of our present station.I saw a few bees or wasps and several lizards; and the blackberry busheswere full of ants nests, webbed like a spider's but so close and compactas not to admit the rain. A trunk of a tree about 50 feet long lay on thebeach, from which I conclude that a heavy sea sets in here with anortherly wind.This day being the anniversary of the restoration of King Charles theSecond, and the name not being inapplicable to our present situation (forwe were restored to fresh life and strength) I named this RestorationIsland; for I thought it probable that Captain Cook might not have takennotice of it. The other names which I have presumed to give the differentparts of the coast are meant only to show my route more distinctly.At noon I observed the latitude of the island to be 12 degrees 39 minutessouth, our course having been north 66 degrees west, distance 18 milesfrom yesterday noon. The wind was at east-south-east with very fineweather.In the afternoon I sent parties out again to gather oysters, with whichand some of the inner part of the palm-top we made another good stew forsupper, each person receiving a full pint and a half; but I refused breadto this meal for I considered that our wants might yet be very great, andwas intent on saving our principal support whenever it was in my power.After supper we again divided and those who were on shore slept by a goodfire.Saturday 30.In the morning I discovered a visible alteration in our company for thebetter, and I sent them away again to gather oysters. We had now only twopounds of pork left. This article, which I could not keep under lock andkey as I did the bread, had been pilfered by some inconsiderate person,but everyone denied having any knowledge of this act; I thereforeresolved to put it out of their power for the future by sharing whatremained for our dinner. While the party was out picking up oysters I gotthe boat in readiness for sea, and filled all our water vessels, whichamounted to nearly 60 gallons.The party being returned, dinner was soon ready, which was as plentiful ameal as the supper on the preceding evening, and with the pork I gave anallowance of bread. As it was not yet noon I sent the people once more togather oysters for a sea store, recommending to them to be as diligent aspossible for that I was determined to sail in the afternoon.At noon I again observed the latitude 12 degrees 39 minutes south; it wasthen high-water, the tide had risen three feet, but I could not becertain from whence the flood came. I deduce the time of high-water atfull and change to be ten minutes past seven in the morning.Early in the afternoon the people returned with the few oysters that theyhad collected and everything was put into the boat. I then examined thequantity of bread remaining and found 38 days allowance, according to thelast mode of issuing a 25th of a pound at breakfast and at dinner.Fair weather and moderate breezes at east-south-east and south-east.Being ready for sea I directed every person to attend prayers. At fouro'clock we were preparing to embark when about twenty of the nativesappeared, running and hallooing to us, on the opposite shore. They wereeach armed with a spear or lance and a short weapon which they carried intheir left hand: they made signs for us to come to them. On the top ofthe hills we saw the heads of many more: whether these were their wivesand children or others who waited for our landing, meaning not to showthemselves lest we might be intimidated, I cannot say but, as I found wewere discovered to be on the coast, I thought it prudent to make the bestof our way for fear of being pursued by canoes, though, from the accountsof Captain Cook, the chance was that there were very few if any ofconsequence on any part of the coast. I passed these people as near as Icould with safety: they were naked and apparently black, and their hairor wool bushy and short.I directed my course within two small islands that lie to the north ofRestoration Island, passing between them and the mainland towards FairCape with a strong tide in my favour, so that I was abreast of it byeight o'clock. The coast we passed was high and woody. As I could see noland without Fair Cape I concluded that the coast inclined to thenorth-west and west-north-west: I therefore steered more towards thewest; but by eleven o'clock at night we met with low land which inclinedto the north-east, and at three o'clock in the morning I found that wewere embayed, which obliged us to stand back for a short time to thesouthward.Sunday 31.At daybreak I was exceedingly surprised to find the appearance of thecountry entirely changed, as if in the course of the night we had beentransported to another part of the world; for we had now a low sandycoast in view, with very little verdure or anything to indicate that itwas at all habitable to a human being except a few patches of small treesor brushwood.Many small islands were in sight to the north-east about six milesdistant. The eastern part of the main bore north four miles, and FairCape south-south-east five or six leagues. I took the channel between thenearest island and the mainland, which were about one mile apart, leavingall the islands on the starboard side. Some of these were very prettyspots, covered with wood and well situated for fishing: large shoals offish were about us but we could not catch any. In passing this strait wesaw another party of Indians, seven in number, running towards us,shouting and making signs for us to land. Some of them waved greenbranches of the bushes which were near them as a token of friendship; butsome of their other motions were less friendly. A little farther off wesaw a larger party who likewise came towards us. I therefore determinednot to land though I much wished to have had some intercourse with thesepeople. Nevertheless I laid the boat close to the rocks and beckoned tothem to approach but none of them would come within 200 yards of us. Theywere armed in the same manner as the people we had seen from RestorationIsland; they were stark naked, their colour black, with short bushy hairor wool, and in their appearance were similar to them in every respect.An island of a good height bore north half west four miles from us, atwhich I resolved to land and from thence to take a look at the coast. Atthis isle we arrived about eight o'clock in the morning. The shore wasrocky but the water was smooth and we landed without difficulty. I senttwo parties out, one to the northward and the other to the southward, toseek for supplies, and others I ordered to stay by the boat. On thisoccasion fatigue and weakness so far got the better of their sense ofduty that some of the people expressed their discontent at having workedharder than their companions, and declared that they would rather bewithout their dinner than go in search of it. One person in particularwent so far as to tell me, with a mutinous look, that he was as good aman as myself. It was not possible for me to judge where this might havean end if not stopped in time, therefore to prevent such disputes infuture I determined either to preserve my command or die in the attemptand, seizing a cutlass, I ordered him to take hold of another and defendhimself, on which he called out that I was going to kill him andimmediately made concessions. I did not allow this to interfere furtherwith the harmony of the boat's crew and everything soon became quiet.The parties continued collecting what they could find, which were somefine oysters and clams and a few small dog-fish that were caught in theholes of the rocks. We also found some rainwater in the hollow of therocks on the north part of the island, so that of this essential articlewe were again so fortunate as to obtain a full supply.After regulating the mode of proceeding I walked to the highest part ofthe island to consider our route for the night. To my surprise no more ofthe mainland could be seen here than from below, the northernmost part insight, which was full of sandhills bearing west by north about threeleagues. Except the isles to the east-south-east and south that we hadpassed I could only discover a small key north-west by north. As this wasconsiderably farther from the main than the spot on which we were atpresent I judged it would be a more secure resting-place for the night,for here we were liable to an attack, if the Indians had canoes, as theyundoubtedly must have observed our landing. My mind being made up on thispoint I returned after taking a particular look at the island we were on,which I found only to produce a few bushes and some coarse grass, theextent of the whole not being two miles in circuit. On the north side ina sandy bay I saw an old canoe about 33 feet long, lying bottom upwardsand half buried in the beach. It was made of three pieces, the bottomentire, to which the sides were sewed in the common way. It had a sharpprojecting prow rudely carved in resemblance of the head of a fish; theextreme breadth was about three feet and I imagine it was capable ofcarrying 20 men. The discovery of so large a canoe confirmed me in thepurpose of seeking a more retired place for our night's lodging.At noon the parties were all returned but had found much difficulty ingathering the oysters from their close adherence to the rocks, and theclams were scarce: I therefore saw that it would be of little use toremain longer in this place, as we should not be able to collect morethan we could eat. I named this Sunday Island: it lies north by westthree-quarters west from Restoration Island; the latitude by a goodobservation 11 degrees 58 minutes south.We had a fresh breeze at south-east by south with fair weather. At twoo'clock in the afternoon we dined, each person having a full pint and ahalf of stewed oysters and clams, thickened with small beans which Nelsoninformed me were a species of Dolichos. Having eaten heartily andcompleted our water I waited to determine the time of high-water, which Ifound to be at three o'clock, and the rise of the tide about five feet.According to this it is high-water on the full and change at 19 minutespast 9 in the morning: I observed the flood to come from the southward,though at Restoration Island I thought it came from the northward. Ithink Captain Cook mentions that he found great irregularity in the setof the flood on this coast.We steered for the key seen in the north-west by north where we arrivedjust at dark, but found it so surrounded by a reef of rocks that I couldnot land without danger of staving the boat; and on that account we cameto a grapnel for the night.Monday June 1.At dawn of day we got on shore and tracked the boat into shelter for, thewind blowing fresh without and the ground being rocky, it was not safe totrust her at a grapnel lest she should be blown to sea: I was thereforeobliged to let her ground in the course of the ebb. From appearances Iexpected that if we remained till night we should meet with turtle as wediscovered recent tracks of them. Innumerable birds of a noddy kind madethis island their resting-place; so that we had reason to flatterourselves with hopes of getting supplies in greater abundance than it hadhitherto been in our power. Our situation was at least four leaguesdistant from the main. We were on the north-westernmost of four smallkeys which were surrounded by a reef of rocks connected by sandbanksexcept between the two northernmost, and there likewise it was dry at lowwater, the whole forming a lagoon island into which the tide flowed: atthis entrance I kept the boat.As usual I sent parties away in search of supplies but, to our greatdisappointment, we could only get a few clams and some dolichos: withthese and the oysters we had brought from Sunday Island I made up a messfor dinner with the addition of a small quantity of bread.Towards noon Nelson and some others who had been to the easternmost keyreturned, but Nelson was in so weak a condition that he was obliged to besupported by two men. His complaint was a violent heat in his bowels, aloss of sight, much drought, and an inability to walk. This I found wasoccasioned by his being unable to support the heat of the sun and that,when he was fatigued and faint, instead of retiring into the shade torest he had continued to attempt more than his strength was equal to. Iwas glad to find that he had no fever; and it was now that the littlewine which I had so carefully saved became of real use. I gave it in verysmall quantities with some pieces of bread soaked in it; and he soonbegan to recover. The boatswain and carpenter also were ill andcomplained of headache and sickness of the stomach. Others who had nothad any evacuation by stool became shockingly distressed with thetenesmus so that there were but few without complaints. An idea prevailedthat the sickness of the boatswain and carpenter was occasioned by eatingthe dolichos. Myself however and some others who had taken the same foodfelt no inconvenience; but the truth was that many of the people hadeaten a large quantity of them raw, and Nelson informed me that they wereconstantly teasing him whenever a berry was found to know if it was goodto eat; so that it would not have been surprising if many of them hadbeen really poisoned.Our dinner was not so well relished as at Sunday Island because we hadmixed the dolichos with our stew. The oysters and soup however were eatenby everyone except Nelson whom I fed with a few small pieces of breadsoaked in half a glass of wine, and he continued to mend.In my walk round the island I found several coconut shells, the remainsof an old wigwam, and the backs of two turtless, but no sign of anyquadruped. One of the people found three seafowl's eggs.As is common on such spots the soil is little other than sand, yet itproduced small toa-trees and some others that we were not acquaintedwith. There were fish in the lagoon, but we could not catch any. Ourwants therefore were not likely to be supplied here, not even with waterfor our daily expense: nevertheless I determined to wait till themorning, that we might try our success in the night for turtle and birds.A quiet night's rest also, I conceived, would be of essential service tothose who were unwell.The wigwam and turtle shell were proofs that the natives at times visitedthis place, and that they had canoes the remains of the large canoe thatwe saw at Sunday Island left no room to doubt: but I did not apprehendthat we ran any risk by remaining here a short time. I directed our firehowever to be made in the thicket that we might not be discovered by itslight.At noon I observed the latitude of this island to be 11 degrees 47minutes south. The mainland extended towards the north-west and was fullof white sandhills: another small island lay within us, bearing west bynorth one quarter north three leagues distant. Our situation being verylow we could see nothing of the reef towards the sea.The afternoon was advantageously spent in sleep. There were however a fewnot disposed to it, and those were employed in dressing some clams totake with us for the next day's dinner: others we cut up in slices todry, which I knew was the most valuable supply we could find here, butthey were very scarce.Towards evening I cautioned everyone against making too large a fire orsuffering it after dark to blaze up. Mr. Samuel and Mr. Peckover hadsuperintendence of this business, while I was strolling about the beachto observe if I thought it could be seen from the main. I was justsatisfied that it could not when on a sudden the island appeared all in ablaze that might have been discerned at a much more considerabledistance. I ran to learn the cause and found that it was occasioned bythe imprudence and obstinacy of one of the party who in my absence hadinsisted on having a fire to himself, in making which the flames caughtthe neighbouring grass and rapidly spread. This misconduct might haveproduced very serious consequences by discovering our situation to thenatives for, if they had attacked us, we had neither arms nor strength tooppose an enemy. Thus the relief which I expected from a little sleep wastotally lost and I anxiously waited for the flowing of the tide that wemight proceed to sea.It was high-water at half-past five this evening whence I deduced thetime on the full and change of the moon to be 58 past 10 in the morning:the rise was nearly five feet. I could not observe the set of the floodbut imagined it to come from the southward, and that I was mistaken atRestoration Island as I found the time of high-water gradually later themore we advanced to the northward.At Restoration Island high-water full and change : 7 hours 10.Sunday Island high-water full and change : 9 hours 19.Here high-water full and change : 10 hours 58.After eight o'clock Mr. Samuel and Mr. Peckover went out to watch forturtle and three men went to the east key to endeavour to catch birds.All the others, complaining of being sick, took their rest, except Mr.Hayward and Mr. Elphinston whom I directed to keep watch. About midnightthe bird party returned with only twelve noddies, birds which I havealready described to be about the size of pigeons: but if it had not beenfor the folly and obstinacy of one of the party, who separated from theother two and disturbed the birds, they might have caught a great number.I was so much provoked at my plans being thus defeated that I gave thisoffender a good beating.* I now went in search of the turtling party whohad taken great pains but without success. This did not surprise me as itwas not to be expected that turtle would come near us after the noisewhich had been made at the beginning of the evening in extinguishing thefire. I therefore desired them to come back, but they requested to stay alittle longer as they still hoped to find some before daylight: howeverthey returned by three o'clock without any reward for their labour.(*Footnote. Robert lamb. This man when he came to Java acknowledged hehad eaten nine birds raw after he separated from his two companions.)Tuesday 2.The birds we half dressed that they might keep the better: and these witha few clams made the whole of the supply procured here. I tied a few giltbuttons and some pieces of iron to a tree for any of the natives thatmight come after us and, finding my invalids much better for theirnight's rest, we embarked and departed by dawn of day. Wind atsouth-east; course to the north by west.When we had run two leagues to the northward the sea suddenly becamerough which, not having before experienced since we were within thereefs, I concluded to be occasioned by an open channel to the ocean. Soonafterwards we met with a large shoal on which were two sandy keys;between these and two others, four miles to the west, I passed on to thenorthward, the sea still continuing to be rough.Towards noon I fell in with six other keys, most of which produced somesmall trees and brushwood. These formed a pleasing contrast with themainland we had passed which was full of sandhills. The country continuedhilly and the northernmost land, the same we had seen from the lagoonisland, appeared like downs, sloping towards the sea. Nearly abreast ofus was a flat-topped hill which on account of its shape I calledPudding-pan hill; and a little to the northward were two other hillswhich we called the Paps; and here was a small tract of country withoutsand, the eastern part of which forms a cape whence the coast inclines tothe north-west by north.At noon I observed in the latitude of 11 degrees 18 minutes south thecape bearing west distant ten miles. Five small keys bore from north-eastto south-east, the nearest of them about two miles distant, and a lowsandy key between us and the cape bore west distant four miles. My coursefrom the lagoon island had been north half west distant 30 miles.I am sorry it was not in my power to obtain a sufficient knowledge of thedepth of water but in our situation nothing could be undertaken thatmight have occasioned delay. It may however be understood that to thebest of my judgment from appearances a ship may pass wherever I haveomitted to represent danger.I divided six birds and issued one 25th of a pound of bread with half apint of water to each person for dinner, and I gave half a glass of wineto Nelson, who was now so far recovered as to require no otherindulgence.The gunner when he left the ship brought his watch with him, by which wehad regulated out time till today, when unfortunately it stopped; so thatnoon, sunrise, and sunset, are the only parts of the 24 hours of whichfrom henceforward I can speak with certainty as to time.The wind blew fresh from the south-south-east and south-east all theafternoon with fair weather. As we stood to the north by west we foundmore sea, which I attributed to our receiving less shelter from the reefsto the eastward: it is probable they did not extend so far north as this;at least it may be concluded that there is not a continued barrier toprevent shipping having access to the shore. I observed that the streamset to the north-west, which I considered to be the flood. In some placesalong the coast we saw patches of wood. At five o'clock, steering to thenorth-west, we passed a large and fair inlet into which I imagine thereis a safe and commodious entrance; it lies in latitude 11 degrees south.About three leagues to the northward of this is an island, at which wearrived about sunset, and took shelter for the night under a sandy pointwhich was the only part we could land at. This being rather a wildsituation I thought it best to sleep in the boat: nevertheless I sent aparty away to see if anything could be got, but they returned withoutsuccess. They saw a great number of turtle bones and shells where thenatives had been feasting, and their last visit seemed to be of latedate. The island was covered with wood, but in other respects it was alump of rocks.Wednesday 3.We lay at a grapnel till daylight with a very fresh gale and cloudyweather. The main bore from south-east by south to north-north-west halfwest three leagues, and a mountainous island with a flat top, north bywest four or five leagues, between which and the mainland were severalother islands. The spot we were at, which I call Turtle Island, lies inlatitude by account 10 degrees 52 minutes south and 42 miles west fromRestoration Island. Abreast of it the coast has the appearance of a sandydesert, but improves about three leagues farther to the northward whereit terminates in a point, near to which are many small islands. I sailedbetween these islands where I found no bottom at twelve fathoms; the highmountainous island with a flat top and four rocks to the south-east ofit, that I call the Brothers, being on my starboard hand. Soon after anextensive opening appeared in the mainland, in which were a number ofhigh islands. I called this the Bay of Islands. We continued steering tothe north-west. Several islands and keys were in sight to the northward:the most northerly island was mountainous, having on it a very high roundhill, and a smaller was remarkable for a single peaked hill.The coast to the northward and westward of the Bay of Islands is high andwoody and has a broken appearance, with many islands close to it, amongwhich there are fine bays and convenient places for shipping. Thenorthernmost of these islands I call Wednesday Island: to the north-westof this we fell in with a large reef which I believe joins a number ofkeys that were in sight from the north-west to the east-north-east. Wetherefore stood to the south-west half a league when it was noon, and Ihad a good observation of the latitude in 10 degrees 31 minutes south.Wednesday Island bore east by south five miles; the westernmost land insight south-west two or three leagues; the islands to the northward fromnorth-west by west to north-east, and the reef from west to north-eastdistant one mile. I was now tolerably certain that we should be clear ofNew Holland in the afternoon.I know not how far this reef extends. It may be a continuation or adetached part of the range of shoals that surround the coast. I believethe mountainous islands to be separate from the shoals, and have no doubtthat near them may be found good passages for ships. But I ratherrecommend to those who are to pass this strait from the eastward to taketheir direction from the coast of New Guinea: yet I likewise think that aship coming from the southward will find a fair strait in the latitude of10 degrees south. I much wished to have ascertained this point but in ourdistressful situation any increase of fatigue or loss of time might havebeen attended with the most fatal consequences. I therefore determined topass on without delay.As an addition to our dinner of bread and water I served to each personsix oysters.At two o'clock in the afternoon as we were steering to the south-westtowards the westernmost part of the land in sight we fell in with somelarge sandbanks that run off from the coast: I therefore called thisShoal Cape. We were obliged to steer to the northward again till we gotround the shoals, when I directed the course to the west.At four o'clock the westernmost of the islands to the northward borenorth four leagues; Wednesday Island east by north five leagues, andshoal cape south-east by east two leagues. A small island was seenbearing west, at which we arrived before dark and found that it was onlya rock where boobies resort, for which reason I called it Booby Island.Here terminated the rocks and shoals of the north part of New Holland forexcept Booby Island no land was seen to the westward of south after threeo'clock this afternoon.I find that Booby island was seen by Captain Cook and, by a remarkablecoincidence of ideas, received from him the same name, but I cannot withcertainty reconcile the situation of some parts of the coast that I haveseen to his survey. I ascribe this to the various forms in which landappears when seen from the different heights of a ship and a boat. Thechart I have given is by no means meant to supersede that made by CaptainCook, who had better opportunities than I had and was in every respectproperly provided for surveying. The intention of mine is chiefly torender this narrative more intelligible, and to show in what manner thecoast appeared to me from an open boat. I have little doubt but that theopening which I named the Bay of Islands is Endeavour Straits; and thatour track was to the northward of Prince of Wales' Isles. Perhaps, bythose who shall hereafter navigate these seas, more advantage may bederived from the possession of both our charts than from either of themsingly.CHAPTER 17.Passage from New Holland to the Island Timor.Arrive at Coupang.Reception there.June 1789.Wednesday 3.At eight o'clock in the evening we once more launched into the openocean. Miserable as our situation was in every respect I was secretlysurprised to see that it did not appear to affect anyone so strongly asmyself; on the contrary it seemed as if they had embarked on a voyage toTimor in a vessel sufficiently calculated for safety and convenience. Somuch confidence gave me great pleasure and I may venture to assert thatto this cause our preservation is chiefly to be attributed.I encouraged everyone with hopes that eight or ten days would bring us toa land of safety; and, after praying to God for a continuance of his mostgracious protection, I served an allowance of water for supper anddirected our course to the west-south-west to counteract the southerlywinds in case they should blow strong.We had been just six days on the coast of New Holland in the course ofwhich we found oysters, a few clams, some birds, and water. But perhaps abenefit nearly equal to this we received by having been relieved from thefatigue of being constantly in the boat and enjoying good rest at night.These advantages certainly preserved our lives and, small as the supplywas, I am very sensible how much it alleviated our distresses. By thistime nature must have sunk under the extremes of hunger and fatigue. Somewould have ceased to struggle for a life that only promised wretchednessand misery; and others, though possessed of more bodily strength, mustsoon have followed their unfortunate companions. Even in our presentsituation we were most deplorable objects; but the hopes of a speedyrelief kept up our spirits. For my own part, incredible as it may appear,I felt neither extreme hunger nor thirst. My allowance contented me,knowing that I could have no more.Thursday 4.I served one 25th of a pound of bread and an allowance of water forbreakfast and the same for dinner with an addition of six oysters to eachperson. At noon latitude observed 10 degrees 48 minutes south; coursesince yesterday noon south 81 degrees west, distance 111 miles; longitudeby account from Shoal Cape 1 degree 45 minutes west. A strong tradewindat east-south-east with fair weather.This day we saw a number of water-snakes that were ringed yellow andblack, and towards noon we passed a great deal of rock-weed. Though theweather was fair we were constantly shipping water, which kept two menalways employed to bale the boat.Friday 5.At noon I observed in latitude 10 degrees 45 minutes south; our coursesince yesterday west one quarter north, 108 miles; longitude made 3degrees 35 minutes west. Six oysters were, as yesterday, served to eachman, in addition to the usual allowance of bread and water.In the evening a few boobies came about us, one of which I caught with myhand. The blood was divided among three of the men who were weakest, butthe bird I ordered to be kept for our dinner the next day. Served aquarter of a pint of water for supper, and to some who were most in needhalf a pint. In the course of the night, being constantly wet with thesea, we suffered much cold and shiverings.Saturday 6.At daylight I found that some of the clams which had been hung up to dryfor sea-store were stolen; but everyone solemnly denied having anyknowledge of it. This forenoon we saw a gannet, a sand-lark and somewater-snakes which in general were from two or three feet long.The usual allowance of bread and water was served for breakfast, and thesame for dinner with the bird, which I distributed in the usual way, ofWho shall have this? I proposed to make Timor about the latitude of 9degrees 30 minutes south, or 10 degrees south. At noon I observed thelatitude to be 10 degrees 19 minutes south; course north 77 degrees west,distance 117 miles; longitude made from the Shoal Cape, the north part ofNew Holland, 5 degrees 31 minutes west.In the afternoon I took an opportunity of examining our store of bread,and found remaining 19 days allowance, at the former rate of serving one25th of a pound three times a day: therefore, as I saw every prospect ofa quick passage, I again ventured to grant an allowance for supper,agreeable to my promise at the time it was discontinued.Sunday 7.We passed the night miserably wet and cold and in the morning I heardheavy complaints. The sea was high and breaking over us. I could onlyafford the allowance of bread and water for breakfast, but for dinner Igave out an ounce of dried clams to each person, which was all thatremained.At noon I altered the course to the west-north-west to keep more from thesea, as the wind blew strong. Latitude observed 9 degrees 31 minutessouth; course north 57 degrees west, distance 88 miles; longitude made 6degrees 46 minutes west.The sea ran very high all this day and we had frequent showers of rain sothat we were continually wet and suffered much cold in the night. Mr.Ledward the surgeon, and Lawrence Lebogue, an old hardy seaman, appearedto be giving way very fast. I could only assist them by a teaspoonful ortwo of wine which I had carefully saved, expecting such a melancholynecessity.Monday 8.Wind at south-east. The weather was more moderate than it had been forsome days past. A few gannets were seen. At noon I observed in 8 degrees45 minutes south; course west-north-west one quarter west, 106 miles;longitude made 8 degrees 23 minutes west. The sea being smooth I steeredwest by south.At four in the afternoon we caught a small dolphin, which was the firstrelief of the kind that we obtained. I issued about two ounces to eachperson, including the offals, and saved the remainder for dinner the nextday. Towards evening the wind freshened and it blew strong all night, sothat we shipped much water and suffered greatly from the wet and cold.Tuesday 9.At daylight as usual I heard much complaining, which my own feelingsconvinced me was too well founded. I gave the surgeon the Lebogue alittle wine but I could afford them no farther relief except encouragingthem with hopes that a very few days longer, at our present fine rate ofsailing, would bring us to Timor.Gannets, boobies, men of war and tropic birds, were constantly about us.Served the usual allowance of bread and water and at noon we dined on theremains of the dolphin, which amounted to about an ounce per man. Iobserved the latitude to be 9 degrees 9 minutes south; longitude made 10degrees 8 minutes west; course since yesterday noon south 76 degreeswest; distance 107 miles.This afternoon I suffered great sickness from the nature of part of thestomach of the fish which had fallen to my share at dinner. At sunsetserved an allowance of bread and water for supper.Wednesday 10.In the morning after a very comfortless night there was a visiblealteration for the worse in many of the people which gave me greatapprehensions. An extreme weakness, swelled legs, hollow and ghastlycountenances, a more than common inclination to sleep, with an apparentdebility of understanding, seemed to me the melancholy presages of anapproaching dissolution. The surgeon and Lebogue, in particular, weremost miserable objects. I occasionally gave them a few teaspoonfuls ofwine out of the little that remained, which greatly assisted them. Thehopes of being able to accomplish the voyage was our principal support.The boatswain very innocently told me that he really thought I lookedworse than anyone in the boat. The simplicity with which he uttered suchan opinion amused me and I returned him a better compliment.Our latitude at noon was 9 degrees 16 minutes south. Longitude from thenorth part of New Holland 12 degrees 1 minute west. Course sinceyesterday noon west half south 111 miles. Birds and rock-weed showed thatwe were not far from land, but I expected such signs here as there aremany islands between the east part of Timor and New Guinea. The night wasmore moderate than the last.Thursday 11.Everyone received the customary allowance of bread and water, and anextra allowance of water was given to those who were most in need. Atnoon I observed in latitude 9 degrees 41 minutes south; course 77 degreeswest, distance 109 miles; longitude made 13 degrees 49 minutes west. Ihad little doubt of having now passed the meridian of the eastern part ofTimor which is laid down in 128 degrees east. This diffused universal joyand satisfaction.In the afternoon we saw gannets and many other birds, and at sunset wekept a very anxious lookout. In the evening we caught a booby which Ireserved for our dinner the next day.Friday 12.At three in the morning, with an excess of joy, we discovered Timorbearing from west-south-west to west-north-west, and I hauled on a windto the north-north-east till daylight, when the land bore from south-westby south to north-east by north. Our distance from the shore two leagues.It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing ofthe sight of this land diffused among us. It appeared scarce credible toourselves that, in an open boat and so poorly provided, we should havebeen able to reach the coast of Timor in forty-one days after leavingTofoa, having in that time run, by our log, a distance of 3618 miles; andthat, notwithstanding our extreme distress, no one should have perishedin the voyage.I have already mentioned that I knew not where the Dutch settlement wassituated but I had a faint idea that it was at the south-west part of theisland. I therefore, after daylight, bore away alongshore to thesouth-south-west, which I was the more readily induced to do as the windwould not suffer us to go towards the north-east without great loss oftime.The day gave us a most agreeable prospect of the land which wasinterspersed with woods and lawns; the interior part mountainous, but theshore low. Towards noon the coast became higher with some remarkableheadlands. We were greatly delighted with the general look of the countrywhich exhibited many cultivated spots and beautiful situations; but wecould only see a few small huts whence I concluded that no Europeanresided in this part of the island. Much sea ran on the shore which madelanding impracticable. At noon we were abreast of a high headland; theextremes of the land bore south-west half west, and north-north-east halfeast; our distance offshore being three miles; latitude by observation 9degrees 59 minutes south; and my longitude by dead reckoning from thenorth part of New Holland 15 degrees 6 minutes west.With the usual allowance of bread and water for dinner I divided the birdwe had caught the night before, and to the surgeon and Lebogue I gave alittle wine.The wind blew fresh at east and east-south-east with very hazy weather.During the afternoon we continued our course along a low shore coveredwith innumerable palm-trees, called the Fan Palm from the leaf spreadinglike a fan; but here we saw no signs of cultivation, nor had the countryso fine an appearance as to the eastward. This however was only a smalltract, for by sunset it improved again and I saw several great smokeswhere the inhabitants were clearing and cultivating their grounds. We hadnow run 25 miles to the west-south-west since noon and were west fivemiles from a low point which, in the afternoon, I imagined had been thesouthernmost land, and here the coast formed a deep bend with low land inthe bight that appeared like islands. The west shore was high; but fromthis part of the coast to the high cape which we were abreast of at noonthe shore is low and I believe shoal. I particularly remark thissituation because here the very high ridge of mountains that run from theeast end of the island, terminate, and the appearance of the countrychanges for the worse.That we might not run past any settlement in the night I determined topreserve my station till the morning and therefore brought to under aclose-reefed foresail. We were here in shoal water, our distance from theshore being half a league, the westernmost land in sight bearingwest-south-west half west. Served bread and water for supper and, theboat lying to very well, all but the officer of the watch endeavoured toget a little sleep.Saturday 13.At two in the morning we wore and stood in shore till daylight when Ifound we had drifted during the night about three leagues to thewest-south-west, the southernmost land in sight bearing west. Onexamining the coast and not seeing any sign of a settlement we bore awayto the westward having a strong gale against a weather current whichoccasioned much sea. The shore was high and covered with wood, but we didnot run far before low land again formed the coast, the points of whichopening at west I once more fancied we were on the south part of theisland; but at ten o'clock we found the coast again inclining towards thesouth, part of it bearing west-south-west half west. At the same timehigh land appeared in the south-west; but the weather was so hazy that itwas doubtful whether the two lands were separated, the opening onlyextending one point of the compass. For this reason I stood towards theouter land and found it to be the island Roti.I returned to the shore we had left and brought to a grapnel in a sandybay that I might more conveniently calculate my situation. In this placewe saw several smokes where the natives were clearing their grounds.During the little time we remained here the master and carpenter verymuch importuned me to let them go in search of supplies; to which atlength I assented but, not finding any other person willing to be oftheir party, they did not choose to quit the boat. I stopped here nolonger than for the purpose just mentioned,  and we continued steeringalongshore. We had a view of a beautiful-looking country as if formed byart into lawns and parks. The coast is low and covered with woods inwhich are innumerable fan palm-trees that look like coconut walks. Theinterior part is high land but very different from the more eastern partsof the island where it is exceedingly mountainous and to appearance thesoil better.At noon the island Roti bore south-west by west seven leagues. I had noobservation for the latitude but by account we were in 10 degrees 12minutes south; our course since yesterday noon being south 77 degreeswest 54 miles. The usual allowance of bread and water was served forbreakfast and dinner, and to the surgeon and Lebogue I continued to givewine.We had a strong breeze at east-south-east with hazy weather all theafternoon. At two o'clock, having run through a very dangerous breakingsea, the cause of which I attributed to be a strong tide setting towindward, and shoal water, we discovered a spacious bay or sound with afair entrance about two or three miles wide. I now conceived hopes thatour voyage was nearly at an end as no place could appear more eligiblefor shipping or more likely to be chosen for a European settlement: Itherefore came to a grapnel near the east side of the entrance in a smallsandy bay where we saw a hut, a dog, and some cattle, and I immediatelysent the boatswain and gunner away to the hut to discover theinhabitants.The south-west point of the entrance bore west half south three miles;the south-east point south by west three-quarters of a mile; and theisland Roti from south by west one quarter west to south-west one quarterwest about five leagues.While we lay here I found the ebb came from the northward, and before ourdeparture the falling of the tide discovered to us a reef of rocks abouttwo cables length from the shore, the whole being covered at high-waterrenders it dangerous. On the opposite shore also appeared very highbreakers; but there is nevertheless plenty of room and certainly a safechannel for a first-rate man of war.The bay or sound within, seemed to be of a considerable extent, thenorthern part being about five leagues distant. Here the land made inmoderate risings joined by lower grounds. But the island Roti to thesouthward is the best mark by which to know this place.I had just time to make these remarks when I saw the boatswain and gunnerreturning with some of the natives: I therefore no longer doubted of oursuccess and that our expectations would be fully gratified. They broughtfive Indians and informed me that they had found two families where thewomen treated them with European politeness. From these people I learnedthat the governor resided at a place called Coupang which was somedistance to the north-east. I made signs for one of them to go in theboat and show us the way to Coupang, intimating that I would pay him forhis trouble: the man readily complied and came into the boat.These people were of a dark tawny colour, had long black hair, and cheweda great deal of betel. Their dress was a square piece of cloth round thehips in the folds of which was stuck a large knife; a handkerchiefwrapped round the head, and another hanging by the four corners from theshoulders, which served as a bag for their betel equipage. They broughtus a few pieces of dried turtle and some ears of Indian corn. This lastwas the most welcome; for the turtle was so hard that it could not beeaten without being first soaked in hot water. They offered to bring ussome other refreshments if I would wait, but as the pilot was willing Idetermined to push on. It was about half an hour past four when wesailed.By direction of the pilot we kept close to the east shore under all oursail; but as night came on the wind died away and we were obliged to tryat the oars which I was surprised to see we could use with some effect.At ten o'clock, finding we advanced but slowly, I came to a grapnel andfor the first time I issued double allowance of bread and a little wineto each person.Sunday 14.At one o'clock in the morning, after the most happy and sweet sleep thatever men enjoyed, we weighed and continued to keep the east shore onboard in very smooth water; when at last I found we were again open tothe sea, the whole of the land to the westward that we had passed beingan island which the pilot called Pulo Samow. The northern entrance ofthis channel is about a mile and a half or two miles wide and I had noground at ten fathoms.The report of two cannon that were fired gave new life to everyone; andsoon after we discovered two square-rigged vessels and a cutter at anchorto the eastward. We endeavoured to work to windward but were obliged totake to our oars again, having lost ground on each tack. We kept close tothe shore and continued rowing till four o'clock when I brought to agrapnel and gave another allowance of bread and wine to all hands. Assoon as we had rested a little we weighed again, and rowed till neardaylight when we came to a grapnel off a small fort and town which thepilot told me was Coupang.Among the things which the boatswain had thrown into the boat before weleft the ship was a bundle of signal flags that had been used by theboats to show the depth of water in sounding; with these we had in thecourse of the passage made a small jack which I now hoisted in the mainshrouds as a signal of distress, for I did not think proper to landwithout leave.Soon after daybreak a soldier hailed us to land, which I immediately didamong a crowd of Indians, and was agreeably surprised to meet with anEnglish sailor who belonged to one of the vessels in the road. Hiscaptain he told me was the second person in the town; I therefore desiredto be conducted to him as I was informed the governor was ill and couldnot then be spoken with.Captain Spikerman received me with great humanity. I informed him of ourdistressed situation; and requested that care might be taken of those whowere with me without delay. On which he gave directions for theirimmediate reception at his own house, and went himself to the governor toknow at what time I could be permitted to see him, which was fixed to beat eleven o'clock.I now desired my people to come on shore which was as much as some ofthem could do, being scarce able to walk: they however were helped to thehouse and found tea with bread and butter provided for their breakfast.The abilities of a painter, perhaps, could seldom have been displayed tomore advantage than in the delineation of the two groups of figures whichat this time presented themselves to each other. An indifferent spectatorwould have been at a loss which most to admire, the eyes of faminesparkling at immediate relief, or the horror of their preservers at thesight of so many spectres, whose ghastly countenances, if the cause hadbeen unknown, would rather have excited terror than pity. Our bodies werenothing but skin and bones, our limbs were full of sores, and we wereclothed in rags: in this condition, with the tears of joy and gratitudeflowing down our cheeks, the people of Timor beheld us with a mixture ofhorror, surprise, and pity.The governor, Mr. William Adrian van Este, notwithstanding extremeill-health, became so anxious about us that I saw him before theappointed time. He received me with great affection and gave me thefullest proofs that he was possessed of every feeling of a humane andgood man. Sorry as he was, he said, that such a calamity could ever havehappened to us, yet he considered it as the greatest blessing of his lifethat we had fallen under his protection and, though his infirmity was sogreat that he could not do the office of a friend himself, he would givesuch orders as I might be certain would procure us every supply wewanted. A house should be immediately prepared for me, and with respectto my people he said that I might have room for them either at thehospital or on board of captain Spikerman's ship which lay in the road;and he expressed much uneasiness that Coupang could not afford thembetter accommodations, the house assigned to me being the only oneuninhabited and the situation of the few families that lived at thisplace such that they could not conveniently receive strangers. For thepresent till matters could be properly regulated he gave directions thatvictuals for my people should be dressed at his own house.On returning to Captain Spikerman's house I found that every kind reliefhad been given to my people. The surgeon had dressed their sores and thecleaning of their persons had not been less attended to, several friendlygifts of apparel having been presented to them.I desired to be shown to the house that was intended for me, which Ifound ready with servants to attend. It consisted of a hall, with a roomat each end, and a loft overhead; and was surrounded by a piazza with anouter apartment in one corner and a communication from the back part ofthe house to the street. I therefore determined, instead of separatingfrom my people, to lodge them all with me; and I divided the house asfollows: one room I took to myself, the other I allotted to the master,surgeon, Mr. Nelson, and the gunner; the loft to the other officers, andthe outer apartment to the men. The hall was common to the officers andthe men had the back piazza. Of this disposition I informed the governor,and he sent down chairs, tables and benches, with bedding and othernecessaries for the use of everyone.The governor when I took my leave had desired me to acquaint him witheverything of which I stood in need; but it was only at particular timesthat he had a few moments of ease, or could attend to anything, being ina dying state with an incurable disease. On this account I transactedwhatever business I had with Mr. Timotheus Wanjon, the second of thisplace, who was the you governor's son-in-law, and who also contributedeverything in his power to make our situation comfortable. I had been,therefore, misinformed by the seaman who told me that captain Spikermanwas the next person in command to the governor.At noon a dinner was brought to the house sufficiently good to makepersons more accustomed to plenty eat too much. Yet I believe few in sucha situation would have observed more moderation than my people did. Mygreatest apprehension was that they would eat too much fruit, of whichthere was great variety in season at this time.Having seen everyone enjoy this meal of plenty I dined myself with Mr.Wanjon; but I felt no extraordinary inclination to eat or drink. Rest andquiet I considered as more necessary to the reestablishment of my healthand therefore retired soon to my room which I found furnished with everyconvenience. But instead of rest my mind was disposed to reflect on ourlate sufferings, and on the failure of the expedition; but above all onthe thanks due to Almighty God who had given us power to support and bearsuch heavy calamities and had enabled me at last to be the means ofsaving eighteen lives.In times of difficulty there will generally arise circumstances that bearparticularly hard on a commander. In our late situation it was not theleast of my distresses to be constantly assailed with the melancholydemands of my people for an increase of allowance which it grieved me torefuse. The necessity of observing the most rigid economy in thedistribution of our provisions was so evident that I resisted theirsolicitations and never deviated from the agreement we made at settingout. The consequence of this care was that at our arrival we had stillremaining sufficient for eleven days at our scanty allowance: and if wehad been so unfortunate as to have missed the Dutch settlement at Timorwe could have proceeded to Java where I was certain that every supply wewanted could be procured.Another disagreeable circumstance to which my situation exposed me wasthe caprice of ignorant people. Had I been incapable of acting they wouldhave carried the boat on shore as soon as we made the island of Timorwithout considering that landing among the natives at a distance from theEuropean settlement might have been as dangerous as among any otherIndians.The quantity of provisions with which we left the ship was not more thanwe should have consumed in five days had there been no necessity forhusbanding our stock. The mutineers must naturally have concluded that wecould have no other place of refuge than the Friendly Islands for it wasnot likely they should imagine that, so poorly equipped as we were inevery respect, there could have been a possibility of our attempting toreturn homewards: much less can they suspect that the account of theirvillainy has already reached their native country.When I reflect how providentially our lives were saved at Tofoa by theIndians delaying their attack and that, with scarce anything to supportlife, we crossed a sea of more than 1200 leagues, without shelter fromthe inclemency of the weather; when I reflect that in an open boat withso much stormy weather we escaped foundering, that not any of us weretaken off by disease, that we had the great good fortune to pass theunfriendly natives of other countries without accident, and at lasthappily to meet with the most friendly and best of people to relieve ourdistresses; I say when I reflect on all these wonderful escapes theremembrance of such great mercies enables me to bear, with resignationand cheerfulness, the failure of an expedition the success of which I hadso much at heart and which was frustrated at a time when I wascongratulating myself on the fairest prospect of being able to completeit in a manner that would fully have answered the intention of HisMajesty and the humane promoters of so benevolent a plan.With respect to the preservation of our health during a course of 16 daysof heavy and almost continual rain I would recommend to everyone in asimilar situation the method we practised which is to dip their clothesin the salt-water and wring them out as often as they become filled withrain: it was the only resource we had, and I believe was of the greatestservice to us, for it felt more like a change of dry clothes than couldwell be imagined. We had occasion to do this so often that at length allour clothes were wrung to pieces: for, except the few days we passed onthe coast of New Holland, we were continually wet either with rain orsea.Thus through the assistance of Divine Providence we surmounted thedifficulties and distresses of a most perilous voyage and arrived safe inan hospitable port where every necessary and comfort were administered tous with a most liberal hand.CHAPTER 18.At Coupang.JUNE 1789.TIMOR.From the great humanity and attention of the governor and the gentlemenat Coupang we received every kind of assistance and were not long withoutevident signs of returning health. Shortly after our arrival I presentedto the governor a formal account of the loss of the Bounty; and arequisition in His Majesty's name that instructions might be sent to allthe Dutch settlements to stop the ship if she made her appearance. Withthis a complete descriptive list of the mutineers was given.I likewise requested in one of my first visits to the governor thatNelson might have permission to walk about the country in search ofplants, which was readily granted with an offer of whatever assistance Ishould think necessary: and the governor assured me that the country waswell worth examination as it abounded with many curious and medicinalplants. From this indulgence I derived no benefit, for Nelson, who sincewe left New Holland had been but in a weak condition, about this time wastaken ill in consequence of a cold caused by imprudently leaving off warmclothing.To secure our arrival at Batavia before the October fleet sailed forEurope I gave public notice of my intention to hire a vessel to carry usto Batavia. In consequence of this notice several offers were made butnone that I thought reasonable; which determined me to purchase a smallschooner in the road, that was 34 feet long, for which I gave 1000rix-dollars and fitted her for sea under the name of His Majesty'sschooner Resource. As the coast of Java is frequently infested with smallpiratical vessels it was necessary that we should be provided with theproper means of defence. In this I was assisted by the friendship of Mr.Wanjon who supplied me with four brass swivels, 14 stand of small arms,and ammunition, which he obligingly let me have as a loan to be returnedat Batavia.July 20.On the 20th of July I had the misfortune to lose Mr. David Nelson: hedied of an inflammatory fever. The loss of this honest man I very muchlamented: he had with great care and diligence attended to the object forwhich he was sent, and had always been ready to forward every plan thatwas proposed, for the good of the service in which we were engaged. Hewas not less useful in our voyage hither, in the course of which he gaveme great satisfaction, by the patience and fortitude with which heconducted himself.July 21.This day I was employed attending the funeral of Mr. Nelson. The corpsewas carried by twelve soldiers dressed in black preceded by the minister;next followed myself and the second governor; then ten gentlemen of thetown and the officers of the ships in the harbour; and after them my ownofficers and people.After reading our burial-service the body was interred behind the chapel,in the burying-ground appropriated to the Europeans of the town. I wassorry I could get no tombstone to place over his remains.This was the second voyage Mr. Nelson had undertaken to the South Seas,having been sent out by Sir Joseph Banks to collect plants, seeds, etc.in Captain Cook's last voyage. And now, after surmounting so manydifficulties, and in the midst of thankfulness for his deliverance, hewas called upon to pay the debt of nature at a time least expected.August 20.Our schooner being victualled and ready for sea, on the 20th of August Itook an affectionate leave of the hospitable and friendly inhabitants ofCoupang and embarked. In the afternoon we sailed, having the launch whichhad so much contributed to our preservation in tow. We exchanged saluteswith the fort and shipping as we ran out of the harbour.The town of Coupang is situated in a great bay which is an excellent roadfor shipping. The latitude of the town is 10 degrees 12 minutes south.According to the Dutch charts it is in 121 degrees 51 minutes eastlongitude. Taking the mean between the longitude by my reckoning on ourarrival at Coupang, and the longitude afterwards calculated from our runto Batavia, gives me for the longitude of Coupang 124 degrees 41 minuteseast.This settlement was formed in the year 1630 and is the only one the Dutchhave on the island Timor. They have residents in different parts of thecountry. On the north side of Timor there is a Portuguese settlement. Theproduce of the island is chiefly sandalwood and beeswax: the formerarticle is now scarce. Wax they have in great plenty. The bees buildtheir nests in bushes and in the boughs of trees to which the nativescannot approach but with fire. The honey is put into jars and the wax isrun into blocks of three feet in length and from 12 to 15 inches square.The natives, at least those who live in the neighbourhood of Coupang, areof a very indolent disposition, of which the Chinese have takenadvantage, for, though the Malays are very fond of traffic, most of theirtrade is carried on in small Chinese vessels of from 10 to 30 tonsburden. There is a market at Coupang for the country people in whichhowever there is little business done. I have seen a man from the countrycome to market with two potatoes: and this is not unusual. These beingsold for two doits (equal to a halfpenny English) serve to supply himwith betel to chew; and the remainder of the day is passed in loungingabout the town. The inland people, who live at a distance from theEuropeans, are strong and active, but their want of cleanliness subjectsthem to filthy diseases.The chief of the natives, or king of the island, is by the Dutch styledKeyfer (Emperor). This prince lives at a place called Backennassy, aboutfour miles distant from Coupang. His authority over the natives is notwholly undisputed; which is by the Dutch attributed to the intrigues ofthe Portuguese, who are on the north part of Timor. The island has latelysuffered much by a competition between the present king and one of hisnephews, which caused a civil war that lasted from the beginning of theyear 1786 to 1788, when their differences were settled by a treaty,chiefly in favour of the king. The ravages committed in these disputeshave occasioned a scarcity of provisions that probably, from the want ofindustry in the natives, will not soon be remedied. I had an opportunityof making a visit to the king. His dwelling was a large house which wasdivided into only three apartments and surrounded by a piazza, agreeablysituated but very dirty, as was all the furniture. The king, who is anelderly man, received me with much civility and ordered refreshments tobe set before me, which were tea, rice cakes, roasted Indian corn, anddried buffalo flesh, with about a pint of arrack, which I believe was allhe had. His dress was a check wrapper girded round his waist with a silkand gold belt, a loose linen jacket, and a coarse handkerchief about hishead. A few of his chiefs were with him who partook of our repast; afterwhich the king retired with three of them for a short time and when hereturned presented me with a round plate of metal about four inchesdiameter on which was stamped the figure of a star. As I had beeninformed that arrack would be an acceptable present I was prepared tomake a return which was well received. They never dilute their liquor andfrom habit are able to drink a large quantity of spirits at a timewithout being intoxicated.When a king dies a large feast is made to which all the inhabitants areinvited. The body after a few days is put into a coffin which is closedup and kept three years before it is interred.The Dutch have been at some pains to establish Christianity among thenatives: but it has not gained much ground, except in the neighbourhoodof Coupang. The present king was christened by the name of Barnardus. HisIndian name is Bachee Bannock. The scriptures are translated into theMalay language and prayers are performed in the church at Coupang by aMalay clergyman, in that language.I met at Timor with most of the fruits that are described in CaptainCook's first voyage as natives of Batavia, except the mangosteen. Thebreadfruit tree, called by the Malays soccoom, likewise grows here withgreat luxuriance and appears to be as much a native of this island as itis of Otaheite. The fruit is exactly of the same kind but not so good. Abreadfruit of Timor weighs half as much more as one of equal size atOtaheite. It is not used here as bread but generally eaten with milk andsugar. At Backennassy I saw about twenty of the trees, larger than any Ihave seen at Otaheite. Here is also a sort of breadfruit tree thatproduces seeds not unlike Windsor beans and equally palatable eitherboiled or roasted. No other part of the fruit is eatable and, though thetree I am told is to all appearance the same as the other, the fruitshave but little resemblance, the fruit of this being covered withprojecting points nearly half an inch in length.I received a present of some fine plants from the governor, which I wasafterwards unfortunately obliged to leave at Batavia for want of properroom to take care of them in the packet by which I returned to Europe.Mr. Wanjon likewise favoured me with some seeds for His Majesty's gardenat Kew which I had the good fortune to deliver safe on my return: andsome of the mountain rice cultivated at Timor on the dry land, which wasforwarded to His Majesty's botanic garden at St. Vincent, and to otherparts in the West Indies.A resemblance of language between the people of the South Sea islands andthe inhabitants of many of the islands in the East Indies has beenremarked in Captain Cook's first voyage. Here the resemblance appearedstronger than has yet been noticed; particularly in their numerals. Butbesides the language I observed some customs among the people of Timorstill more striking for their similarity. They practise the tooge-tooge*of the Friendly Islands which they call toombock: and the roomee ofOtaheite which they call ramas. I likewise saw, placed on their graves,offerings of baskets with tobacco and betel.(*Footnote. The tooge-tooge is described in Captain Cook's last voyageVolume 1 page 323; and the roomee in the same voyage Volume 2 page 64.)I left the governor Mr. van Este at the point of death. To this gentlemanour most grateful thanks are due for the humane and friendly treatmentthat we received from him. His ill state of health only prevented himfrom showing us more particular marks of attention. Unhappily it is tohis memory only that I now pay this tribute. It was a fortunatecircumstance for us that Mr. Wanjon, the next in place to the governor,was equally humane and ready to relieve us. His attention was unremittingand, when there was a doubt about supplying me with money to enable me topurchase a vessel, he cheerfully took it upon himself; without which itwas evident, I should have been too late at Batavia to have sailed forEurope with the October fleet. I can only return such services by everretaining a grateful remembrance of them.Mr. Max the town surgeon likewise behaved to us with the mostdisinterested humanity: he attended everyone with the utmost care, forwhich I could not prevail on him to receive any payment, or to render meany account, or other answer than that it was his duty.CHAPTER 19.From Timor to Batavia.AUGUST 1789.Thursday 20.From Coupang we steered north-west by west having a moderate breeze atsouth-east with fair weather.Saturday 22.At daylight we saw the island Flores to the northward. At noon latitudeobserved 9 degrees 27 minutes south, and longitude by account fromCoupang 2 degrees 10 minutes west. Our distance from the coast of Floreswas about 10 leagues; and two high peaked mountains bore north half eastand north-north-west. These two mountains resemble each other in shapeand the westernmost is a volcano. The interior parts of Flores aremountainous and woody: but near the sea-coast is a fine open country. ADutch map with which I was provided places the south part of Flores in 9degrees 3 minutes south which I am of opinion is too far south. Westeered along the south side of Flores, mostly with light winds and hazyweather, so that we did not constantly keep sight of the coast.Tuesday 25.At noon we were off Toorns island which bore north-west by north three orfour leagues distant. Our latitude observed was 8 degrees 57 minutessouth and longitude made by dead reckoning from Coupang 3 degrees 27minutes west. Toorns island is about four leagues in circuit and has acraggy and uneven appearance. There is a curious high peak on thesouth-west part: the land near the shore is low and woody.Thursday 27.On the 27th at noon we were near the entrance of the Straits of Mangaryn,which not appearing so open and clear as represented in the map, Isteered for the straits of Sapi, intending to pass through; but wasobliged to give up this plan by strong currents setting to the south-eastwhich there was not sufficient wind to enable us to stem.Saturday 29.I therefore again stood for the Straits of Mangaryn which we ran throughin the afternoon of the 29th, being favoured with a fresh breeze from thesouth-south-east. On our first entering the straits we got close to theFlores shore: our course through was north half east. We tried forsoundings but could not anywhere find bottom at 25 and 30 fathoms depth.On the Flores side there are many good harbours and bays where vesselsmay anchor; but the country hereabouts appears burnt up and desolate.I had no azimuth-compass and consequently could not observe veryaccurately the variation; but I believe there is so little in MangarynStraits that no great error will be occasioned by considering the trueand magnetic bearings to be the same.When we had passed the straits we kept to the westward, running along thenorth side of the island Sumbawa, where there is a very high mountainnear the coast, at the foot of which I am informed, are many runs of goodwater, conveniently situated for ships to supply themselves. The latitudeof the north part of Sumbawa I make by my observations and bearings to be8 degrees 6 minutes south, which differs very little from the Dutchcharts.Monday 31.In the night of the 31st several prows were rowing about us, on whichaccount we kept all night under arms.September. Thursday 3.This and the two following days we were sailing along the north side ofthe island Lombok, on which is a high mountain. Most of the islands inthis route are distinguished by high mountains. Lombok appears to be wellclothed with wood. In the nights we saw fires upon the high lands at adistance from the coast.Sunday 6.In the afternoon we saw the high land of Cape Sandana, which is thenorth-east part of Java.Monday 7.The next day we were off cape Sandana which is a low cape projecting fromthe high land already mentioned. This cape is placed by the Dutch maps in7 degrees 52 minutes south. But according to my observation and ourestimated distance from the land I make it in 7 degrees 46 minutes southlatitude. The longitude by my dead reckoning from Coupang to Cape Sandanawas 11 degrees 33 minutes west.Thursday 10.We steered to the westward along the coast of Java and on the 10th atnoon we anchored off Passourwang, a Dutch settlement on the coast ofJava, in two fathoms, distant from the shore half a league, the entranceof the river bearing south-west. The coast hereabouts so is shoal thatlarge ships are obliged to anchor three or four miles from the land. Assoon as we were at anchor I got in my boat and went on shore. The banksof the river near the entrance were mud, on which grew a few mangrovebushes. Among them we saw hogs running and many were laying dead in themud, which caused a most intolerable stench and made me heartily repenthaving come here; but after proceeding about a mile up the river, thecourse of which was serpentine, we found a very pleasant country andlanded at a small and well-constructed fort, where I was received in afriendly and polite manner by M. Adrian van Rye, the commandant. By thereturn of the boat I sent on board a small bullock and other provisions.I likewise took a pilot to conduct us to Sourabaya.The houses at Passourwang are neatly built and the country appears to bewell cultivated. The produce of this settlement is rice, of which theyexport large quantities. There are but few Dutch here: the Javanese arenumerous and their chief lives with considerable splendour. They havegood roads and posts are established along the coast; and it appears tobe a busy and well-regulated settlement. Latitude 7 degrees 36 minutessouth. Longitude 1 degree 44 minutes west of Cape Sandana.Friday 11.The next day about noon we sailed.Saturday 12.And on the 12th in the evening anchored in Sourabaya road in sevenfathoms: the flagstaff bearing south one quarter west; distance from theshore one mile. We found riding here seven square-rigged and severalsmaller vessels.It was too late when we anchored to send a boat on shore.Sunday 13.The next morning before daylight three guard-boats stationed themselvesnear us and I was informed that I must not land or send a boat on shore.This restriction I learnt from the officer of the guard-boats was inconformity to general orders concerning all strange vessels on theirfirst arrival. At nine in the forenoon leave came off for us to land andsoon after the guard-boats quitted us.I was received on shore with great civility and friendship by thegovernor or Opperhoost M. Ant. Barkay, and the commandant of the troopsM. de Bose. By these gentlemen I was hospitably entertained, and advisedto remain till the 16th when some vessels were to sail, with whom I mightkeep company, which they recommended on account of pirates.Sourabaya is one of the most pleasant places I ever saw. It is situatedon the banks of a river and is a mile and a half distant from theseashore so that only the flagstaff can be seen from the road. The riveris navigable up to the town for vessels of 100 tons burden, and the bankon one side is made convenient for tracking. The Chinese carry on aconsiderable trade here, and have a town or camp on the side of the riveropposite to Sourabaya. The country near the town is flat and the soillight, so that they plow with a single bullock or buffalo (karrabow). Theinterior parts of the country near the mountains are infested with abreed of fierce tigers, which makes travelling inland very dangerous.They have here a breed of horses which are small but they are handsomeand strong.The Javanese in this neighbourhood are numerous. M. Barkay and M. de Bosetook me with them to pay a visit to two of the principal natives, whom wefound attended by a number of men armed with pikes in great militaryorder. We were entertained with a concert of music; the instruments weregongs, drums, and a fiddle with two strings. I hired a pilot here tocarry us to Batavia. Our latitude observed in Sourabaya road was 7degrees 11 minutes south. Longitude made from Cape Sandana 1 degree 52minutes west.Thursday 17.On the 17th we sailed from Sourabaya in company with three prows. At noonwe anchored at Crissey which is a town with a small fort belonging to theDutch. We remained here about two hours and then weighed. Latitude ofCrissey 7 degrees 9 minutes south. Longitude from Cape Sandana 1 degree55 minutes west.The navigation through the Straits of Madura is so intricate that withthe little opportunity I had I am unable to undertake a description ofit.Friday 18.The next day, having passed the straits, we bore away to the westwardalong the coast of Java in company with the prows before mentioned.Tuesday 22.We had regular soundings all the way to Samarang, off which place weanchored on the 22nd in the afternoon; the church bearing south-east;distance from the shore half a league: depth of water two fathoms. Theshoalness of the coast here makes the road of Samarang very inconvenient,both on account of the great distance that large ships (of which therewere several in the road) are obliged to lay from the shore, and of thelanding which is in a river that cannot be entered before half-flood.This river resembles the one at Passourwang, the shores being low withoffensive dead animals laying about. I was met at the landing-place bythe equipage-master, and he furnished me with a carriage to carry me tothe governor, whose residence is about two miles from the town ofSamarang. I requested and obtained leave to have our wants supplied,which were to recruit our provisions, and to get a any mainmast, havingsprung ours in the passage from Sourabaya.Samarang is a fortified town surrounded by a wall and ditch, and is themost considerable settlement next to Batavia that the Dutch have in Java.Here is a very good hospital and a public school, chiefly for teachingthe mathematics. They have likewise a theatre. Provisions are remarkablycheap here, beef being at ten doits per pound and the price of a fowl 12doits.I experienced great civility from some of the gentlemen at Samarang,particularly from M. le Baron de Bose, a merchant, brother to the M. deBose, commandant of the troops at Sourabaya: and from M. Abegg, thesurgeon of the hospital, to whom we were indebted for advice andmedicines for which he would not consent to receive payment.The latitude of Samarang is 6 degrees 57 minutes. Longitude by myreckoning from Cape Sandana 4 degrees 7 minutes west.Saturday 26.On the 26th we sailed from Samarang and with us a galley mounting sixswivels which the governor had directed to accompany us to Batavia.October. Thursday 1.On the 1st of October we anchored in Batavia road, where we found ridinga Dutch ship of war and 20 sail of Dutch East India ships, besides manysmaller vessels.CHAPTER 20.Occurrences at Batavia and Passage thence to England.OCTOBER 1789.In the afternoon at four o'clock I went on shore and landed at a house bythe river where strangers first stop and give an account who they are,whence they came, etc. From this place a Malay gentleman took me in acarriage to Sabandar, Mr. Engelhard, whose house was in the environs ofthe city on the side nearest the shipping. The Sabandar is the officerwith whom all strangers are obliged to transact their business: at leastthe whole must go through his hands. With him I went to pay my respectsto the governor-general who received me with great civility. I acquaintedhis excellency with my situation and requested my people might be takencare of and that we should be allowed to take a passage to Europe in thefirst ship that sailed. I likewise desired permission to sell theschooner and launch. All this his excellency told me should be granted. Ithen took leave and returned with the Sabandar who wrote down theparticulars of my wants in order to form from them a regular petition tobe presented to the council the next day. I had brought from the governorof Coupang, directed for the governor-general at Batavia, the account ofmy voyage and misfortune, translated into Dutch from an account that Ihad given to Mr. van Este. So attentive had they been at Timor toeverything that related to us.There is a large hotel at Batavia fitted up purposely for theaccommodation of strangers, who are not allowed to reside at any otherplace. It is situated near the great river in a part of the city that isreckoned the most airy and healthy. Nevertheless I found the air hot andsuffocating and was taken ill in the night with a violent pain in myhead.Friday 2.The next morning at nine the council sat and I attended, accompanied bythe Sabandar; and was informed that the council had complied with all Ihad requested.When I returned to the hotel my headache increased and a violent fevercame on. I sent to acquaint the Sabandar of my situation and was soonafter attended by the head surgeon of the town hospital Mr. Aansorp, bywhose care and skill in less than 24 hours the fever considerably abatedbut a severe headache continued. I had an invitation from thegovernor-general to dine with him, which of course I was obliged todecline.I hired a carriage which cost three dollars per day for the benefit oftaking an airing. My lodgings at the hotel were so close and hot that Idesired the Sabandar to apply to the Governor-General for leave to hire ahouse in the country; which request his excellency not only immediatelycomplied with but gave directions for my being accommodated at the houseof the physician or surgeon-general Mr. Sparling.One of my people, Thomas Hall, being ill with a flux I obtained leave forhim to be sent to the country hospital which is a convenient airybuilding.Tuesday 6.This morning at sunrise I left the hotel and was carried to Mr.Sparling's house, about four miles distant from the city and near theconvalescent hospital which at this time had also sick men in it, thewhole number of patients amounting to 800. I found everything preparedfor my comfort and convenience. Mr. Sparling would suffer me to take nomedicine though I had still considerable fever with headache: but I foundso much relief from the difference of the air that in the evening I wasable to accompany Mr. Sparling on a visit to the governor-general at oneof his country seats, where we found many ladies all dressed in the Malayfashion, some of them richly ornamented with jewels. I had invitationsfrom several gentlemen and some very kindly pressed me to make theircountry houses my abode till my health should be reestablished.My indisposition increasing, Mr. Sparling advised me to quit Batavia asspeedily as possible and represented the necessity of it to thegovernor-general. I was informed from his excellency that thehomeward-bound ships were so much crowded that there would be nopossibility of all my people going in one ship, and that they could beaccommodated no other way than by dividing them into different ships.Seeing therefore that a separation was unavoidable I determined to followthe advice of the physician and, as a packet was appointed to sail forEurope on the 16th instant, I sent to request of the governor that Imight be allowed to take a passage in her for myself and as many of mypeople as they were able to receive. In answer to this I was acquaintedthat myself and two more could be accommodated in the packet, she beingtoo small to admit a greater number; but that I might rest assured ofpassages being provided for those that remained by the earliestopportunities.Friday 9.This day anchored in the road the General Elliot, an English shipcommanded by Captain Lloyd. In the Straits of Banca he had met with someboats belonging to the East India Company's ship Vansittart that was lostin the straits of Billaton by having struck on a rock that went throughher bottom. Captain Wilson, who commanded the Vansittart, I was informedhad just finished a survey of those Straits and was hoisting his boat inwhen the ship struck. Immediately on receiving the intelligence CaptainLloyd, in the General Elliot and another ship in company called theNonsuch, sailed for the wreck. They found the ship had been burnt down tothe water's edge by the Malays. They however saved 40 chests of treasureout of 55 which were said to have been on board. Most of the ship'scompany were saved: one man only was lost in the ship, and five others ina small boat were missing who were supposed to have taken some of thetreasure. The greater part of the people went with Captain Wilson toChina, and some were with Captain Lloyd.Saturday 10.This morning the Resource was sold by public auction: the custom atBatavia is to begin high and to lower the price till some person bids;and the first bidder is the buyer. She was accordingly put up at 2000rix-dollars but to my great disappointment no one offered to purchasebefore the auctioneer had lowered the demand to 295 rix-dollars, forwhich price she was sold, the purchaser being an Englishman, Captain JohnEddie, who commanded an English ship from Bengal. If no strangers hadbeen present at the sale I imagine they would have let her run down to200 dollars, in which case I should have had no alternative.The launch likewise was sold. The services she had rendered us made mefeel great reluctance at parting with her; which I would not have done ifI could have found a convenient opportunity of getting her conveyed toEurope.Little as the schooner had sold for I found I was in danger of having thesum lessened; for the Sabandar informed me that by an order of thecouncil there was a duty on the sale of all vessels. With this demand Iwould by no means comply for I thought I had sufficiently suffered insustaining a loss of 705 rix-dollars out of 1000 by the purchase and saleof the vessel, she having cost 1000 rix-dollars.This day Thomas Hall, whom I had sent to be taken care of at thehospital, died. He had been ill of a flux from the time of our arrival atTimor.Monday 12.I agreed with the captain of the packet for a passage to Europe formyself, my clerk, and a servant. The Sabandar informed me it wasnecessary that my officers and people should be examined before a notaryrespecting the loss of the Bounty, as otherwise the governor and councilwere not legally authorised to detain her if she should be found in anyof the Dutch settlements. They were therefore at my desire examined, andafterwards made affidavit before the governor and council at theStadthouse.My officers complaining to me of the unreasonableness of some tradesmen'sbills I spoke to the Sabandar. A bill of 51 dollars for five hats hereduced to 30 dollars and in other articles made proportionabledeductions.Paper money is the currency of Batavia and is so understood in allbargains. At this time paper was at 28 per cent discount: there islikewise a difference in the value of the ducatoon which at Batavia is 80stivers and in Holland only 63 stivers: this occasions a loss of 21 1/4per cent on remittance of money. It therefore follows that if any personat Batavia remits money by bills of exchange to Europe they lose by thediscount and the exchange 49 1/4 per cent.Those who have accounts to pay and can give unexceptionable bills onEurope will find a considerable saving by negotiating their bills withprivate people who are glad to give for them a premium of 20 per cent atthe least. This discovery I made somewhat too late to profit by.One of the greatest difficulties that strangers have to encounter istheir being obliged to live at the hotel. This hotel was formerly twohouses which by doors of communication have been made one. It is in themiddle of a range of buildings more calculated for a cold country thanfor such a climate as Batavia. There is no free circulation of air andwhat is equally bad it is always very dirty; and there is great want ofattendance. What they call cleaning the house is another nuisance; forthey never use any water to cool it or to lay the dust, but sweep dailywith brooms in such a manner that those in the house are almostsuffocated by a cloud of dust.The months of December and January are reckoned the most unhealthy of theyear, the heavy rains being then set in. The account of the seasons asgiven to me here I believe may be relied on.The middle of November the west monsoon begins and rain.December and January. Continual rain with strong westerly wind.February. Westerly wind. Towards the end of this month the rain begins toabate.March. Intervals of fine weather. Wind westerly.April. In this month the east monsoon begins. Weather generally fine withshowers of rain.May. East monsoon fixed. Showery.June and July. Clear weather. Strong east wind.August and September. Wind more moderate.October. In this month the wind begins to be variable with showers ofrain.The current is said always to run with the wind. Nevertheless I found thereverse in sailing from Timor to Java. Between the end of October and thebeginning of the ensuing year no Dutch ship bound for Europe is allowedto sail from Batavia for fear of being near the Mauritius at the time ofthe hurricanes which are frequent there in December and January.My illness prevented me from gaining much knowledge of Batavia. Of theirpublic buildings I saw nothing that gave me so much satisfaction as theircountry hospital for seamen. It is a large commodious and airy buildingabout four miles from the town, close to the side of the river, or ratherin the river: for the ground on which it stands has by labour been madean island of, and the sick are carried there in a boat: each ward is aseparate dwelling and the different diseases are properly classed. Theyhave sometimes 1400 patients in it: at this time there were 800, but morethan half of these were recovered and fit for service, of whom 300 weredestined for the fleet that was to sail for Europe. I went through mostof the wards and there appeared great care and attention. The sheets,bedding, and linen of the sick were perfectly neat and clean. The houseof the physician, Mr. Sparling, who has the management of the hospital isat one extremity of the building: and here it was that I resided. To theattention and care of this gentleman, for which he would receive nopayment, I am probably indebted for my life.The hospital in the town is well attended, but the situation is so illchosen that it certainly would be the saving of many lives to build onein its stead up the river, which might be done with great advantage aswater carriage is so easy and convenient. A great neglect in some of thecommanders of the shipping here was suffering their people to go dirtyand frequently without frock, shirt, or anything to cover their bodies,which, besides being a public nuisance, must probably be productive ofill health in the most robust constitution.The governor-general gave me leave to lodge all my people at the countryhospital which I thought a great advantage and with which they wereperfectly satisfied. The officers however at their own request remainedin the town.The time fixed for the sailing of the packet approaching, I settled myaccounts with the Sabandar, leaving open the victualling account to beclosed by Mr. Fryer the master previous to his departure, who I likewiseauthorised to supply the men and officers left under his command with onemonth's pay to enable them to purchase clothing for their passage toEngland.I had been at great pains to bring living plants from Timor, in six tubs,which contained jacks, nancas, karambolas, namnams, jambos, and threethriving breadfruit plants. These I thought might be serviceable at theCape of Good Hope if brought no farther: but I had the mortification ofbeing obliged to leave them all at Batavia. I took these plants on boardat Coupang on the 20th of August: they had experienced a passage of 42days to my arrival here. The breadfruit plants died to the root andsprouted afresh from thence. The karambolas, jacks, nancas, and namnams Ihad raised from the seed and they were in fine order. No judgment canhence be formed of the success of transporting plants, as in the presenttrial they had many disadvantages.Friday 16.This morning being sunrise I embarked on board the Vlydte packetcommanded by Captain Peter Couvret, bound for Middleburgh. With melikewise embarked Mr. John Samwell, clerk, and John Smith, seaman. Thoseof our company who stayed behind the governor promised me should followin the first ships and be as little divided as possible. At 7 o'clock thepacket weighed and sailed out of the road.Sunday 18.On the 18th we spoke the Rambler, an American brig belonging to Boston,bound to Batavia. After passing the Straits of Sunda we steered to thenorth of the Cocos Isles. These islands, Captain Couvret informed me, arefull of coconut trees: there is no anchorage near them but good landingfor boats. Their latitude 12 degrees 0 minutes south. Longitude 96degrees 5 minutes east.In the passage to the Cape of Good Hope there occurred nothing worthremark. I cannot however forbear noticing the Dutch manner of navigating.They steer by true compass, or rather endeavour so to do, by means of asmall movable central card, which they set to the meridian: and wheneverthey discover the variation has altered 2 1/2 degrees since the lastadjustment they again correct the central card. This is steering within aquarter of a point, without aiming at greater exactness. The officer ofthe watch likewise corrects the course for leeway by his own judgmentbefore it is marked down in the log board. They heave no log: I was toldthat the company do not allow it. Their manner of computing their run isby means of a measured distance of 40 feet along the ship's side: theytake notice of any remarkable patch of froth when it is abreast theforemost end of the measured distance, and count half seconds till themark of froth is abreast the after end. With the number of half secondsthus obtained they divide the number 48, taking the product for the rateof sailing in geographical miles in one hour, or the number of Dutchmiles in four hours.It is not usual to make any allowance to the sun's declination on accountof being on a different meridian from that for which the tables arecalculated: they in general compute with the numbers just as they arefound in the table. From all this it is not difficult to conceive thereason why the Dutch are frequently above ten degrees out in theirreckoning. Their passages likewise are considerably lengthened by notcarrying a sufficient quantity of sail.December 16.In the afternoon we anchored in Table Bay.December 17.The next morning I went on shore and waited on his excellency M. VanderGraaf who received me in the most polite and friendly manner. TheGuardian, commanded by Lieutenant Riou, had left the Cape about eightdays before with cattle and stores for Port Jackson. This day anchored intable bay the Astree, a French frigate, commanded by the Count de St.Rivel from the Isle of France, on board of which ship was the lategovernor, the Chevalier d'Entrecasteaux. Other ships that arrived duringmy stay at the Cape were a French 40-gun frigate, an East India ship, anda brig, of the same nation: likewise two other French ships with slavesfrom the coast of Mozambique bound to the West Indies: a Dutch packetfrom Europe, after a four months passage: and the Harpy, a South SeaWhaler with 500 barrels of spermaceti, and 400 of seal and other oils.There is a standing order from the Dutch East India Company that noperson who takes a passage from Batavia for Europe in any of their shipsshall be allowed to leave the ship before she arrives at her intendedport. According to which regulation I must have gone to Holland in thepacket. Of this I was not informed till I was taking leave of thegovernor-general at Batavia, when it was too late for him to give theCaptain an order to permit me to land in the channel. He however desiredI would make use of his name to governor Vander Graaf, who readilycomplied with my request and gave the necessary orders to the Captain ofthe packet, a copy of which his excellency gave to me; and at the sametime recommendatory letters to people of consequence in Holland in case Ishould be obliged to proceed so far.I left a letter at the Cape of Good Hope to be forwarded to governorPhillips at Port Jackson by the first opportunity, containing a shortaccount of my voyage with a descriptive list of the pirates: and fromBatavia I had written to Lord Cornwallis, so that every part of Indiawill be prepared to receive them.Saturday 2.We sailed from the Cape in company with the Astree French frigate. Thenext morning neither ship nor land were in sight. On the 15th we passedin sight of the island St. Helena. The 21st we saw the island Ascension.On the 10th of February, the wind being at north-east blowing fresh, oursails were covered with a fine orange-coloured dust. Fuego, thewesternmost of the Cape de Verde islands and the nearest land to us onthat day at noon bore north-east by east half east, distance 140 leagues.When we had passed the latitude of the Western Islands a lookout was keptfor some rocks which Captain Couvret had been informed lay in latitude 44degrees 25 minutes north and 2 degrees 50 minutes east longitude from theeast end of St. Michael. This information Captain Couvret had receivedfrom a person that he knew and who said he had seen them. On the 13th ofMarch we saw the Bill of Portland and on the evening of the next day,Sunday March the 14th, I left the packet and was landed at Portsmouth byan Isle of Wight boat.Those of my officers and people whom I left at Batavia were provided withpassages in the earliest ships; and at the time we parted were apparentlyin good health. Nevertheless they did not all live to quit Batavia. Mr.Elphinstone, master's mate, and Peter Linkletter, seaman, died within afortnight after my departure, the hardships they had experienced havingrendered them unequal to cope with so unhealthy a climate as that ofBatavia. The remainder embarked on board the Dutch fleet for Europe, andarrived safe at this country, except Robert Lamb, who died on thepassage, and Mr. Ledward the surgeon who has not yet been heard of. Thusof nineteen who were forced by the mutineers into the launch it haspleased God that twelve should surmount the difficulties and dangers ofthe voyage and live to revisit their native country.End of Project Gutenberg's A Voyage to the South Sea, by William Bligh*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH SEA ******** This file should be named 15411.txt or 15411.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/5/4/1/15411/Produced by Sue Asscher and Col Choat.Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

His "Gulistan," or "Rose Garden," is themature work of his life-time, and he lived to the age of one hundred andeight. The Rose Garden was an actual thing, and was part of the littlehermitage, to which he retired, after the vicissitudes and travels ofhis earlier life, to spend his days in religious contemplation, and theembodiment of his experience in reminiscences, which took the form ofanecdotes, sage and pious reflections, _bon-mots_, and exquisite lyrics.When a friend visited him in his cell and had filled a basket withnosegays from the garden of the poet with roses, hyacinths, spikenards,and sweet-basils, Sa'di told him of the book he was writing, andadded:--"What can a nosegay of flowers avail thee? Pluck but one leaffrom my Rose Garden; the rose from yonder bush lasts but a few days, butthis Rose must bloom to all eternity."Sa'di has been proved quite correct in this estimate of his own work.The book is indeed a sweet garden of unfading freshness. If we compareSa'di with Hafiz, we find that both of them based their theory of lifeupon the same Sufic pantheism. Both of them were profoundly religiousmen. Like the strong and life-giving soil out of whose bosom sprang therose-tree, wherein the nightingales sang, was the fixed religiousconfidence, which formed the support of each poet's mind, amid all thevagaries of fancy, and the luxuriant growth of fruit and flower whichtheir genius gave to the world. Hafiz is the Persian Anacreon. As heraises his voice of thrilling and unvarying sweetness, his steps reel,he waves the thyrsus, and his flushed cheek shows the inspiration of thevine. To him the Supreme Being has much in common with the Indian orThracian Dionysus, the god of perennial youth, joyous revel, andexhilaration. Hafiz can never be the guide, though he may be the cheererof mortals, adding more to the gayety than to the wisdom of life. Butboth in the western and in the eastern world Sa'di must always be lookedupon as the guide and enlightener of those who taste life, and lovepoetry. It has been said by a wise man that poetry is the greatinstructor of mature minds. Many a man turning away in weariness fromthe controversies, the insincerities, and the pretentiousness of theintellectualists around him, has exclaimed, "Give me my Horace." ButHorace with all his _bonhommie_, his common sense, and his acuteness, isbut the representative of a narrow Roman coterie of the Augustan age.How thin, flimsy, and unspiritual does he appear in comparison with themarvellous depth, the spiritual insight, the tenderness and power ofexpression which characterized Sa'di.Sa'di had begun his life as a student of the Koran and became earlyimbued with the quietism of Islam. The cheerfulness and exuberant joywhich characterize the poems he wrote before he reached his fortiethyear, had bubbled up under the repressions of severe discipline andausterity. But the religion of Mohammed was soon exchanged by him, underthe guidance of a famous teacher, for the wider and more transcendentalsystem of Sufism. Within the area of this magnificent scheme, theboldest ever formulated under the name of religion, he found the libertywhich his soul desired. Early discipline had made him a morally soundman, and it is the goodness of Sa'di that lends such a warm andendearing charm to his works. The last finish was given to hisintellectual training by the travels which he took after the Tartarinvasion desolated Persia, in the thirteenth century. India, Arabia,Syria, were in turn visited. He found Damascus a congenialhalting-place, and lived there for some time, with an increasingreputation as a sage and poet. He preached at Baalbec on thefugitiveness of human life, on faith, love, and rest in God. Hewandered, like Jerome, in the wilderness about Jerusalem, and worked asa slave in Africa in the trenches of Tripoli: he travelled the lengthand breadth of Asia Minor. When he arrived back at Shiraz, he had passedthe limit of three-score years and ten, and there he remained in hishermitage and his garden, to arrange the result of all his studies, hisexperiences, and his sufferings, in that consummate work which he hasnamed the "Rose Garden," after the little cultivated plot in which hespent his declining days and drew his last breath.The "Gulistan" is divided into eight chapters, each dealing with aspecific subject and partaking of the nature of an essay: although thesechapters are composed of disjointed paragraphs, generally beginning withan aphorism or an anecdote and closing with an original poem of a fewlines. Sometimes these paragraphs are altogether lyrical. We are struck,first of all, by the personal character of these paragraphs; many ofthem relate the experience of the poet in some part of his travels,expressing his comment upon what he had seen and heard. His commentsgenerally take the form of practical wisdom, or religious suggestion. Hegives us the impression that he knows life and the human heartthoroughly. It may be said of him, as Arnold said of Sophocles, he wasone "who saw life steadily, and saw it whole." On the other hand, thereis not the slightest trace of cynical acerbity in his writings. He haspassed through the world in the independence of a self-possessed soul,and has found it all good, saving for the folly of fools and thewretchedness and degradation of the depraved. There is no bitterfountain in the "Rose Garden," and the old man's heart is as fresh aswhen he left Shiraz, thirty years before; the sprightliness of hispoetry has only been ripened and tempered to a more exquisite flavor, bythe increase of wisdom and the perfecting of art.Above all, we find in Sa'di the science of life, as comprising moralityand religion, set forth in a most suggestive and a most attractive form.In some way or other the "Rose Garden" may remind us of the "Essays" ofBacon, which were published in their complete form the year before thegreat English philosopher died. Both works cover a large area of thoughtand experience; but the Englishman is clear, cold, and sometimescynical, while the Persian is more spiritual, though not less acute, andhas the fervor of the poet which Bacon lacks, and the religious devotionwhich the "Essays" altogether miss. The "Rose Garden" has maxims whichare not unworthy of being cherished amid the highest Christiancivilization, while the serenity of mind, the poetic fire, thetransparent sincerity of Sa'di, make his writings one of those bookswhich men may safely take as the guide and inspirer of their inmostlife. Sa'di died at Shiraz about the year 1292 at the reputed age of onehundred and ten.E.W.CHAPTER IOf the Customs of KingsII have heard of a king who made the sign to put a captive to death. Thepoor wretch, in that state of desperation, began to abuse the king inthe dialect which he spoke, and to revile him with asperity, as has beensaid; whoever shall wash his hands of life will utter whatever he mayharbor in his heart:--"_When a man is desperate he will give a latitudeto his tongue, like as a cat at bay will fly at a dog_"--"at the momentof compulsion when it is impossible to fly, the hand will grasp thesharp edge of a sword." The king asked, saying, "What does he say?" Oneof the Vizirs (or nobles in attendance), and a well-disposed man, madeanswer, "O my lord! he is expressing himself and saying, _(paradise isfor such) as are restraining their anger and forgiving theirfellow-creatures; and God will befriend the benevolent_." The king feltcompassion for him, and desisted from shedding his blood. Anothernobleman, and the rival of that former, said, "It is indecorous for suchpeers, as we are, to use any language but that of truth in the presenceof kings; this man abused his majesty, and spoke what was unworthy ofhim." The king turned away indignant at this remark, and replied, "I wasbetter pleased with his falsehood than with this truth that you havetold; for that bore the face of good policy, and this was founded inmalignity; and the intelligent have said, 'A peace-mingling falsehood ispreferable to a mischief-stirring truth':--Whatever prince may do thatwhich he (his counsellor) will recommend, it must be a subject of regretif he shall advise aught but good."They had written over the portico of King Feridun's palace:--"Thisworld, O brother! abides with none. Set thy heart upon its maker, andlet him suffice thee. Rest not thy pillow and support on a worldlydomain which has fostered and slain many such as thou art. Since theprecious soul must resolve on going, what matters it whether it departsfrom a throne or the ground."IIOne of the kings of Khorasan saw, in a dream, Sultan Mahmud, the son ofSaboktagin, an hundred years after his death, when his body was decayedand fallen into dust, all but his eyes, which as heretofore were movingin their sockets and looking about them. All the learned were at a standfor its interpretation, excepting one dervish, who made his obeisance,and said:--"He is still looking about him, because his kingdom andwealth are possessed by others!--Many are the heroes whom they haveburied under ground, of whose existence above it not one vestige isleft; and of that old carcase which they committed to the earth, theearth has so consumed it that not one bone is left. Though many ages aregone since Nushirowan was in being, yet in the remembrance of hismunificence is his fair renown left. Be generous, O my friend! and availthyself of life, before they proclaim it as an event that such a personis not left."IIII have heard of a king's son who was short and mean, and his otherbrothers were lofty in stature and handsome. On one occasion the king,his father, looked at him with disparagement and scorn. The son, in hissagacity, understood him and said, "O father! a short wise man ispreferable to a tall blockhead; it is not everything that is mightier instature that is superior in value:--_a sheep's flesh is wholesome, thatof an elephant carrion_.--_Of the mountains of this earth Sinai is oneof the least, yet is it most mighty before God in state anddignity_.--Heardst thou not what an intelligent lean man said one day toa sleek fat dolt? An Arab horse, notwithstanding his slim make, is moreprized thus than a herd of asses."The father smiled; the pillars of the state, or courtiers, nodded theirassent, and the other brothers were mortified to the quick. Till a manhas declared his mind, his virtue and vice may have lain hidden; do notconclude that the thicket is unoccupied, peradventure the tiger is goneasleep!I have heard that about that time a formidable antagonist appearedagainst the king. Now that an army was levied in each side, the firstperson that mounted his horse and sallied upon the plain was that son,and he exclaimed: "I cannot be that man whose back thou mayest see onthe day of battle, but am him thou mayest descry amidst the thick of it,with my head covered with dust and blood; for he that engages in thecontest sports with his own blood, but he who flees from it sports withthe blood of an army on the day of fight." He so spoke, assaulting theenemy's cavalry, and overthrew some renowned warriors. When he camebefore the king he kissed the earth of obeisance, and said, "O thou, whodidst view my body with scorn, whilst not aware of valor's roughexterior, it is the lean steed that will prove of service, and not thefatted ox, on the day of battle."They have reported that the enemy's cavalry was immense, and those ofthe king few in number; a body of them was inclined to fly, when theyouth called aloud, and said, "Be resolute, my brave men, that you maynot have to wear the apparel of women!" The troops were more courageouson this speech, and attacked altogether. I have heard that on that daythey obtained a complete victory over the enemy. The king kissed hisface and eyes, and folded him in his arms, and became daily moreattached to him, till he declared him heir-apparent to the throne. Thebrothers bore him a grudge, and put poison into his food. His sister sawthis from a window, and closed the shutter; and the boy understood thesign, and withdrew his hand from the dish, and said, "It is hard thatthe virtuous should perish and that the vicious should occupy theirplaces." Were the homayi, or phoenix, to be extinct in the world, nonewould take refuge under the shadow of an owl. They informed the fatherof this event; he sent for the brothers and rebuked them, as theydeserved. Then he made a division of his domains, and gave a suitableportion to each, that discontent might cease; but the ferment wasincreased, as they have said: Ten dervishes can sleep on one rug, buttwo kings cannot be accommodated in a whole kingdom. When a man afterGod's heart can eat the moiety of his loaf, the other moiety he willgive in alms to the poor. A king may acquire the sovereignty of oneclimate or empire; and he will in like manner covet the possession ofanother.IVA horde of Arab robbers had possessed themselves of the fastness of amountain, and waylaid the track of the caravan. The yeomanry of thevillages were frightened at their stratagems, and the king's troopsalarmed, inasmuch as they had secured an impregnable fortress on thesummit of the mountain, and made this stronghold their retreat anddwelling.The superintendents of the adjacent districts consulted together aboutobviating their mischief, saying: If they are in this way left toimprove their fortune, any opposition to them may prove impracticable.The tree that has just taken root, the strength of one man may be ableto extract; but leave it to remain thus for a time, and the machinery ofa purchase may fail to eradicate it: the leak at the dam-head might havebeen stopped with a plug, while, now it has a vent, we cannot ford itscurrent on an elephant.Finally it was determined that they should set a spy over them, andwatch an opportunity when they had made a sally upon another tribe, andleft their citadel unguarded. Some companies of able warriors andexperienced troops were sent, that they might conceal themselves in therecesses of the mountain. At night, when the robbers were returned,jaded with their march and laden with spoil, and had stripped themselvesof their armor, and deposited their plunder, the foremost enemy they hadto encounter was sleep. Now that the first watch of night wasgone:--"the disc of the sun was withdrawn into a shade, and Jonas hadstepped into the fish's mouth "--the bold-hearted warriors sprang fromtheir ambush and secured the robbers by pinioning them one afteranother.In the morning they presented them at the royal tribunal, and the kinggave an order to put the whole to death. There happened to be among thema stripling, the fruit of whose early spring was ripening in its bloom,and the flower-garden of his cheek shooting into blossom. One of thevizirs kissed the foot of the imperial throne, and laid the face ofintercession on the ground, and said, "This boy has not yet tasted thefruit of the garden of life, nor enjoyed the fragrance of the flowers ofyouth: such is my confidence in the generous disposition of his Majestythat it will favor a devoted servant by sparing his blood." The kingturned his face away from this speech; as it did not accord with hislofty way of thinking, he replied:--"The rays of the virtuous cannotilluminate such as are radically vicious; to give education to theworthless is like throwing walnuts upon a dome:--it were wiser toeradicate the tree of their wickedness, and annihilate their tribe; forto put out a fire and leave the embers, and to kill a viper and fosterits young, would not be the acts of rational beings. Though the cloudspour down the water of vegetation, thou canst never gather fruit from awillow twig. Exalt not the fortune of the abject, for thou canst neverextract sugar from a mat or common cane."The vizir listened to this speech; willingly or not he approved of it,and applauded the good sense of the king, and said:--"What his majesty,whose dominion is eternal, is pleased to remark is the mirror of probityand essence of good policy, for had he been brought up in the society ofthose vagabonds, and confined to their service, he would have followedtheir vicious courses. Your servant, however, trusts that he may beinstructed to associate with the virtuous, and take to the habits of theprudent; for he is still a child, and the lawless and refractoryprinciples of that gang cannot have yet tainted his mind; and it is intradition that--_Whatever child is born, and he is verily born after theright way of orthodoxy, namely Islamism, afterwards his father and hismother bring him up as a Jew, Christian, or Guebre_.--The wife of Lotassociated with the wicked, and her posterity failed in the gift ofprophecy; the dog of the seven sleepers (at Ephesus) for some time tookthe path of the righteous, and became a rational being."He said this, and a body of the courtiers joined him in intercession,till the king acceded to the youth's pardon, and answered: "I gave himup, though I saw not the good of it.--Knowest thou what Zal said to theheroic Rustem: 'Thou must not consider thy foe as abject and helpless. Ihave often found a small stream at the fountain-head, which, whenfollowed up, carried away the camel and its load.'"In short, the vizir took the boy home, and educated him with kindnessand liberality. And he appointed him masters and tutors, who taught himthe graces of logic and rhetoric, and all manner of courtieraccomplishments, so that he met general approbation. On one occasion thevizir was detailing some instances of his proficiency and talents in theroyal presence, and saying: "The instruction of the wise has made animpression upon him, and his former savageness is obliterated from hismind." The king smiled at this speech, and replied:--"The whelp of awolf must prove a wolf at last, notwithstanding he may be brought up bya man."Two years after this a gang of city vagabonds got about him, and joinedin league, till on an opportunity he murdered the vizir and his twosons; and, carrying off an immense booty, he took up the station of hisfather in the den of thieves, and became a hardened villain. The kingwas apprised of this event; and, seizing the hand of amazement with theteeth of regret, said:--"How can any person manufacture a tempered sabrefrom base iron; nor can a base-born man, O wiseacre, be made a gentlemanby any education! Rain, in the purity of whose nature there is noanomaly, cherishes the tulip in the garden and common weed in thesalt-marsh. Waste not thy labor in scattered seed upon a briny soil, forit can never be made to yield spikenard; to confer a favor on the wickedis of a like import, as if thou didst an injury to the good."VAt the gate of Oghlamish Patan, King of Delhi, I (namely Sa'di) saw anofficer's son, who, in his wit and learning, wisdom and understanding,surpassed all manner of encomium. In the prime of youth, he at the sametime bore on his forehead the traces of ripe age, and exhibited on hischeek the features of good fortune:--"Above his head, from his prudentconduct, the star of superiority shone conspicuous."In short, it was noticed with approbation by the king that he possessedbodily accomplishments and mental endowments. And sages have remarkedthat worth rests not on riches, but on talents; and the discretion ofage, not in years, but on good sense. His comrades envied his goodfortune, charged him with disaffection, and vainly attempted to have himput to death:--"but what can the rival effect so long as the charmer isour friend?"The king asked, saying, "Why do they show such a disinclination to doyou justice?" He replied: "Under the shadow of his majesty's goodfortune I have pleased everybody, excepting the envious man, who is notto be satisfied but with a decline of my success; and let the prosperityand dominion of my lord the king be perpetual!" I can so manage as togive umbrage to no man's heart; but what can I do with the envious man,who harbors within himself the cause of his own chagrin? Die, O yeenvious, that ye may get a deliverance; for this is such an evil thatyou can get rid of it only by death. Men soured by misfortune anxiouslydesire that the state and fortune of the prosperous may decline; if theeye of the bat is not suited for seeing by day, how can the fountain ofthe sun be to blame? Dost thou require the truth? It were better athousand such eyes should suffer, rather than that the light of the sunwere obscured.VIThey tell a story of a Persian king who had stretched forth the arm ofoppression over the subjects' property, and commenced a system ofviolence and rapacity to such a degree that the people emigrated toavoid the vexatiousness of his tyranny, and took the road of exile toescape the annoyance of his extortions. Now that the population wasdiminished and the resources of the state had failed, the treasuryremained empty, and enemies gathered strength on all sides. Whoever mayexpect a comforter on the day of adversity, say, let him practisehumanity during the season of prosperity; if not treated cordially, thydevoted slave will forsake thee; show him kindness and affection, andthe stranger may become the slave of thy devotion.One day they were reading, in his presence, from the Shah Nameh, of thetyrant Zohak's declining dominion and the succession of Feridun. Thevizir asked the king, saying: "Can you so far comprehend that Feridunhad no revenue, domain, or army, and how the kingdom came to beconfirmed with him?" He answered: "As you have heard, a body of peoplecollected about him from attachment, and gave their assistance till heacquired a kingdom." The vizir said: "Since, O sire, a gathering of thepeople is the means of forming a kingdom, how come you in fact to causetheir dispersion unless it be that you covet not a sovereignty? So farwere good that thou wouldst patronize the army with all thy heart, for aking with an army constitutes a principality." The king asked: "What arethe best means of collecting an army and yeomanry?" He replied:"Munificence is the duty of a king, that the people may assemble aroundhim, and clemency, that they may rest secure under the asylum of hisdominion and fortune, neither of which you have. A tyrant cannot governa kingdom, for the duty of a shepherd is not expected from the wolf. Aking that can anyhow be accessory to tyranny will undermine the wall ofhis own sovereignty."The advice of the prudent minister did not accord with the dispositionof the king. He ordered him to be confined, and immured him in adungeon. It soon came to pass that the sons of the king's uncle rose inopposition, levied an army in support of their pretensions, and claimedthe sovereignty of their father. A host of the people, who had cruellysuffered under the arm of his extortion and were dispersed, gatheredaround and succored them till they dispossessed him of his kingdom andestablished them in his stead. That king who can approve of tyrannizingover the weak will find his friend a bitter foe in the day of hardship.Deal fairly with thy subjects, and rest easy about the warfare of thineenemies, for with an upright prince his yeomanry is an army.       *       *       *       *       *VIIIThey asked Hormuz, son of Nushirowan, "What fault did you find with yourfather's ministers that you ordered them into confinement?" He replied:"I saw no fault that might deserve imprisonment; yet I perceived thatany reverence for me makes a slight impression on their minds, and thatthey put no implicit reliance on my promise. I feared lest from anapprehension of their own safety they might conspire my ruin;therefore, put in practice that maxim of philosophers who have told us:'Stand in awe, O wise man, of him who stands in awe of thee,notwithstanding thou canst cope with a hundred such as he. Thereforewill the snake bite the herdsman's foot, because it fears that he willbruise its head with a stone. Seest thou not that now that the cat isdesperate it will tear out the tiger's eyes with its claws.'"IXIn his old age an Arab king was grievously sick, and had no hopes ofrecovery, when, lo! a messenger on horseback presented himself at thepalace-gate, and joyfully announced, saying: "Under his majesty's goodfortune we have taken such a stronghold, made the enemy prisoners ofwar, and reduced all the landholders and vassals of that quarter toobedience as subjects." On hearing this news the king fetched a coldsigh, and answered: "These glad tidings are not intended for me but formy rivals, namely, the heirs of the sovereignty. My precious life has,alas! been wasted in the hope that what my heart chiefly coveted mightenter at my gate. My bounden hope was gratified; yet what do I benefitby that? There is no hope that my passed life can return. The hand ofdeath beats the drum of departure. Yes, my two eyes, you must bid adieuto my head. Yes, palm of my hand, wrist, and arm, all of you sayfarewell, and each take leave of the other. Death has overtaken me tothe gratification of my foes; and you, O my friends, must at last begoing. My days were blazed away in folly; what I did not do let you takewarning (and do)."XAt the metropolitan mosque of Damascus I was one year fervent in prayerover the tomb of Yahiya, or John the Baptist and prophet, on whom beGod's blessing, when one of the Arab princes, who was notorious for hisinjustice, chanced to arrive on a pilgrimage, and he put up hissupplication, asked a benediction, and craved his wants.--The rich andpoor are equally the devoted slaves of this shrine, and the richer theyare the more they stand in need of succor. Then he spoke to me, saying:"In conformity with the generous resolution of dervishes and theirsincere zeal, you will, I trust, unite with me in prayer, for I havemuch to fear from a powerful enemy." I answered him, "Have compassion onyour own weak subjects, that you may not see disquiet from a strong foe.With a mighty arm and heavy hand it is dastardly to wrench the wrists ofpoor and helpless. Is he not afraid who is hardhearted with the fallenthat if he slip his foot nobody will take him by the hand?--Whoeversowed the seed of vice and expected a virtuous produce, pampered a vainbrain and encouraged an idle whim. Take the cotton from thy ear and domankind justice, for if thou refusest them justice there is a day ofretribution. The sons of Adam are members one of another, for in theircreation they have a common origin. If the vicissitudes of fortuneinvolve one member in pain, all the other members will feel a sympathy.Thou, who art indifferent to other men's affliction, if they call thee aman art unworthy of the name."XIA dervish, whose prayers had a ready acceptance (with God), made hisappearance at Bagdad. Hojaj Yusuf (a great tyrant) sent for him andsaid: "Put up a good prayer for me." He prayed, "O God! take from himhis life!" Hojaj said, "For God's sake, what manner of prayer is this?"He answered: "It is a salutary prayer for you, and for the whole sect ofMussulmans.--O mighty sir, thou oppressor of the feeble, how long canthis violence remain marketable? For what purpose came the sovereigntyto thee? Thy death were preferable to thy tyrannizing over mankind."XIIAn unjust king asked a holy man, saying, "What is more excellent thanprayers?" He answered: "For you to remain asleep till mid-day, that forthis one interval you might not afflict mankind."--I saw a tyrant lyingdormant at noon, and said, "This is mischief, and is best lulled tosleep. It were better that such a reprobate were dead whose state ofsleep is preferable to his being awake."XIIII have heard of a king who had turned night into day in the midst ofconviviality, and in the gayety of intoxication was exclaiming--"I neverwas in this life happier than at this present moment, for I have nothought of evil or good, and care for nobody!"--A naked dervish, who hadtaken up his rest in the cold outside, answered--"O thou, who in goodfortune hast not thy equal in the world, I admit that thou hast no causeof care for thyself, but hast thou none for us?"--The king was pleasedat this speech. He put a purse of a thousand dinars out at the window,and said: "O dervish! hold up your skirt." He replied, "Where can I finda skirt, who have not a garment." The king was still more touched at thehardship of his condition, and adding an honorary dress to thatdonation, sent them out to him.The dervish squandered all that ready cash within a few days, andfalling again into distress, returned.--"Money makes no stay in the handof a religious independent; neither does patience in a lover's heart,nor water in a sieve."--At a time when the king had no thought abouthim, they obtruded his case, and he took offence and turned away hisface. And it is on such an occasion that men of prudence and experiencehave remarked that it behooves us to guard against the wrath and fury ofkings, whose noble thoughts are chiefly occupied with important affairsof state, and cannot endure the importunate clamors of the vulgar.--Thebounty of the sovereign is forbid to him who does not watch a properopportunity. Till thou canst perceive a convenient time for obtruding anopinion, undermine not thy consequence by idle talk.--The king said,"Let this impudent beggar and spendthrift be beaten and driven away, whoin a short time dissipated such a sum of money, for the treasury of theBeat-al-mal, or charity fund, is intended to afford mouthfuls to thepoor, and not bellyfuls to the imps of the devil.--That fool who canilluminate the day with a camphorated taper must soon feel a want of oilfor his lamp at night."One of his discreet ministers said: "O king, it were expedient to supplysuch people with their means of subsistence by instalments, that theymay not squander their absolute necessaries; but, with respect to whatyour majesty commanded as to coercion and prohibition, though it becorrect, a party might impute it to parsimony. Nor does it moreoveraccord with the principles of the generous to encourage a man to hopefor kindness and then overwhelm him with heartbreaking distrust:--Thoumust not open upon thyself the door of covetousness; and when opened,thou must not shut it with harshness.--Nobody will see the thirstypilgrims crowding towards the shore of the briny ocean; but men, birds,and reptiles will flock together wherever they can meet a fresh waterfountain."XIVOne of the ancient kings was easy with the yeomanry in collecting hisrevenue, but hard on the soldiery in his issue of pay; and when aformidable enemy showed its face, these all turned theirbacks.--Whenever the king is remiss in paying his troops, the troopswill relax in handling their arms. What bravery can he display in theranks of battle whose hand is destitute of the means of living?One of those who had excused themselves was in some sort my intimate. Ireproached him and said, "He is base and ungrateful, mean anddisreputable who, on a trifling change of circumstances, can desert hisold master and forget his obligation of many years' employment." Hereplied: "Were I to speak out, I swear by generosity you would excuseme. Peradventure, my horse was without corn, and the housings of hissaddle in pawn.--And the prince who, through parsimony, withholds hisarmy's pay cannot expect it to enter heartily upon his service."--Givemoney to the gallant soldier that he may be zealous in thy cause, for ifhe is stinted of his due he will go abroad for service.--_So long as awarrior is replenished with food he will fight valiantly, and when hisbelly is empty he will run away sturdily_.XVOne of the vizirs was displaced, and withdrew into a fraternity ofdervishes, whose blessed society made its impression upon him andafforded consolation to his mind. The king was again favorably disposedtowards him, and offered his reinstatement in office; but he consentednot, and said, "With the wise it is deemed preferable to be out ofoffice than to remain in place.--Such as sat within the cell ofretirement blunted the teeth of dogs, and shut the mouths of mankind;they destroyed their writings, and broke their writing reeds, andescaped the lash and venom of the critics."--The king answered: "At allevents I require a prudent and able man, who is capable of managing thestate affairs of my kingdom." The ex-minister said: "The criterion, Osire, of a wise and competent man is that he will not meddle with suchlike matters.--The homayi, or phoenix, is honored above all other birdsbecause it feeds on bones, and injures no living creature."A Tamsil, or application in point.--They asked a Siyah-gosh, orlion-provider, "Why do you choose the service of the lion?" He answered:"Because I subsist on the leavings of his prey, and am secure from theill-will of my enemies under the asylum of his valor." They said: "Nowyou have got within the shadow of his protection and admit a gratefulsense of his bounty, why do you not approach more closely, that he mayinclude you within the circle of select courtiers and number you amonghis chosen servants?" He replied, "I should not thus be safe from hisviolence."--Though a Guebre may keep his fire alight for a hundredyears, if he fall once within its flame it will burn him.--_Procul aJove, procul a fulmine_. It on one occasion may chance that the courtierof the king's presence shall pick up a purse of gold, and the next thathe shall lie shorter by the head. And philosophers have remarked,saying, "It is incumbent on us to be constantly aware of the fickledispositions of kings, who will one moment take offence at a salutation,and at another make an honorary dress the return for an act of rudeness;and they have said, That to be over much facetious is the accomplishmentof courtiers and blemish of the wise.--Be wary, and preserve the stateof thine own character, and leave sport and buffoonery to jesters andcourtiers."XVIOne of my associates brought me a complaint of his perverse fortune,saying, "I have small means and a large family, and cannot bear up withmy load of poverty. Often has a thought crossed my mind, suggesting, Letme remove into another country, that in whatever way I can manage alivelihood none may be informed of my good or bad luck."--(Often hewent asleep hungry, and nobody was aware, saying, "Who is he?" Often didhis life hang upon his lip, and none lamented over him.)--"On the otherhand, I reflect on the exultation of my rivals, saying, They willscoffingly sneer behind my back, and impute my zeal in behalf of myfamily to a want of humanity.--Do but behold that graceless vagabond whocan never witness the face of good fortune. He will consult the ease ofhis own person and abandon to distress his wife and children.--And, asis known, I have some small skill in the science of accounts. If,through your respected interest, any office can be obtained that may bethe means of quieting my mind, I shall not, during the remainder oflife, be able to express my sense of its gratitude."I replied, "O brother, the service of kings offers a twofold prospect--ahope of maintenance and a fear for existence; and it accords not withthe counsel of the wise, under that expectation, to incur this risk.--Notax-gatherer will enter the dervish's abode, saying, Pay me the rent ofa field and orchard; either put up with trouble and chagrin, or give thyheartstrings to the crows to pluck."He said, "This speech is not made as applicable to my case, nor have yougiven me a categorical answer. Have you not heard what has beenremarked, 'His hand will tremble on rendering his account who has beenaccessory to a dishonest act.--Righteousness will insure the divinefavor; I never met him going astray who took the righteous path.'--Andphilosophers have said, 'Four orders of people are mortally afraid offour others--the revenue embezzler, of the king; the thief, of thewatchman; the fornicator, of the eavesdropper; and the adulteress, ofthe censor.' But what has he to fear from the comptroller who has a fairset of account-books?--'Be not extravagant and corrupt while in officeif thou wishest that the malice of thy rival may be circumscribed onsettling thy accounts. Be undefiled, O brother, in thy integrity, andfear nobody; washermen will beat only dirty clothes against a stone.'"I replied, "The story of that fox suits your case, which they sawrunning away, stumbling and getting up. Somebody asked him, 'Whatcalamity has happened to put you in such a state of trepidation?' Hesaid, 'I have heard that they are putting a camel in requisition.' Theother answered, 'O silly animal! what connection has a camel with you,or what resemblance is there between you and it?' He said, 'Be silent;for were the envious from malevolence to insist that this is a camel,and I should be seized for one, who would be so solicitous about me asto inquire into my case?' And before they can bring the antidote fromIrac the person bitten by the snake may be dead. In like manner, youpossess knowledge and integrity, discrimination and probity, yet spieslie in ambush, and informers lurk in corners, who, notwithstanding yourmoral rectitude, will note down the opposite; and should you anyhowstand arraigned before the king, and occupy the place of hisreprehension, who in that state would step forward in your defence?Accordingly, I would advise that you should secure the kingdom ofcontentment, and give up all thoughts of preferment. As the wise havesaid:--'The benefits of a sea voyage are innumerable; but if thouseekest for safety, it is to be found only on shore.'"My friend listened to this speech; he got into a passion, cavilled at myfable, and began to question it with warmth and asperity, saying, "Whatwisdom or propriety, good sense or morality, is there in this? Here isverified that maxim of the sage, which tells us they are friends alonethat can serve us in a jail, for all our enemies may pretend friendshipat our own table.--'Esteem him not a friend who during thy prosperitywill brag of his love and brotherly affection.' I account him a friendwho will take his friend by the hand when struggling with despair, andoverwhelmed with misfortune."I perceived within myself, saying, "He is disturbed, and listens to myadvice with impatience;" and, having called the sahib diwan, or lordhigh treasurer, in virtue of a former intimacy that subsisted betweenus, I stated his case and spoke so fully upon his skill and merits, thathe put him in nomination for a trifling office. After some time, havingadverted to his kindly disposition and approved of his good management,his promotion was in train, and he got confirmed in a much higherstation. Thus was the star of his good fortune in ascension, till itrose into the zenith of ambition; and he became the favorite of hismajesty the king, towards whom all turned for counsel, and upon whom alleyes rested their hopes! I rejoiced at this prosperous change of hisaffairs, and said:--"Repine not at thy bankrupt circumstances, nor letthy heart despond, for the fountain of immortality has its source ofchaos.--_Take heed, O brother in affliction! and be not disheartened,for God has in store many hidden mercies_.--Sit not down soured at therevolutions of the times, for patience is bitter, yet it will yieldsweet fruit."At that juncture I happened to accompany a party of friends on a journeyto Hijaz, or Arabia Petraea. On my return from the pilgrimage to Mecca,he came out two stages to meet me. I perceived that his outward plightwas wretched, and his garb that of dervishes. I asked, "How is this?" Hereplied, "Just as you said, a faction bore me a grudge and charged mewith malpractices; and the king, be his reign eternal, would notinvestigate the truth of that charge, and my old and best friends stoodaloof from my defence, and overlooked my claims on our formeracquaintance.--When, through an act of God, a man has fallen, the wholeworld will put their feet upon his neck; when they see that fortune hastaken him by the hand, they will put their hands upon their breasts, andbe loud in his praise.--In short, I underwent all manner of persecutiontill within this week, that the tidings of the safe return of thepilgrims reached us, when I got a release from my heavy durance and aconfiscation of my hereditary tenements." I said, "At that time you didnot listen to my admonition, when I warned you that the service ofprinces is, like a voyage at sea, profitable but hazardous: you eitherget a treasure or perish miserably.--The merchant gains the shore withgold in both his hands, or a wave will one day leave him dead on itsbeach."--Not deeming it generous any further to irritate a poor man'swound with the asperity of reproach, or to sprinkle his sore with thesalt of harsh words, I made a summary conclusion in these two verses,and said:--"Wert thou not aware that thou shouldst find fetters on thyfeet when thou wouldst not listen to the generous man's counsel? Thrustnot again thy finger into a scorpion's hole till thou canst endure thepain of its sting."XVIII was the companion of a holy fraternity, whose manners were correctfrom piety, and minds disciplined from probity. An eminent princeentertained a high and respectful opinion of the worth of thisbrotherhood, and had assigned it an endowment. Perhaps one of themcommitted an act unworthy of the character of dervishes; for the goodopinion of that personage was forfeited, and the market of their supportshut. I wished that I could by any means re-establish the maintenance ofmy friends, and attempted to wait on the great man; but his porteropposed my entrance, and turned me away with rudeness. I excused himconformably with what the witty have said:--"Till thou canst take anintroduction along with thee approach not the gate of a prince, vizir,or lord; for the dog and the doorkeeper, on espying a beggar, will theone seize his skirt and the other his collar."When the favorite attendants of that great man were aware of mysituation, they ushered me into his presence with respect, and offeredme the highest seat; but in humility I took the lowest, and said:"Permit that I, the slave of the abject, should seat myself on a levelwith servants."--The great man answered, "My God, my God! what room isthere for this speech? Wert thou to seat thyself upon the pupil of mineeye, I would court thy dalliance, for thou art lovely."In short, I took my seat, and entered upon a variety of topics, till theindiscretion of my friends was brought upon the carpet, when I said:"What fault did the lord of past munificence remark, that his servantshould seem so contemptible in his sight? Individually with God is theperfection of majesty and goodness, who can discern our failings andcontinue to us his support." When the prince heard this sentiment hesubscribed to its omnipotence; and, with regard to the stipendiaryallowance of my friends, he ordered its continuance as heretofore, and afaithful discharge of all arrears. I thanked him for his generosity,kissed the dust of obeisance, apologized for my boldness, and at themoment of taking my leave, added: "When the fane of the Caabah, atMecca, became their object from a far distant land, pilgrims would hurryon to visit it for many farsangs. It behooves thee to put up with suchas we are, for nobody will throw a stone at a tree that bears nofruit."XVIIIA prince inherited immense riches by succeeding to his father. He openedthe hand of liberality, displayed his munificence, and bestowedinnumerable gifts upon his troops and people. "The brain will not beperfumed by a censer of green aloes-wood; place it over the fire that itmay diffuse fragrance like ambergris. If ambitious of a great name, makea practice of munificence, for the crop will not shoot till thou shaltsow the seed."A narrow-minded courtier began to admonish him, saying, "Verily, formersovereigns have collected this wealth with scrupulosity and stored itadvisedly. Check your hand in this waste, for accidents wait ahead, andfoes lurk behind. God forbid that you should want it on a day ofneed.--Wert thou to distribute the contents of a granary among thepeople, every master of a family might receive a grain of rice; why notexact a grain of silver from each, that thou mightest daily hoard achamber full of treasure?"The prince turned his face aside from this speech, so contrary to hisown lofty sentiments, and harshly reprimanded him, saying, "A great andglorious God made me sovereign of this property, that I might enjoy andspend it; and posted me not a sentinel, to hoard and watch overit.--Carown perished, who possessed forty magazines of treasure;Nushirowan died not, who left behind him a fair reputation."XIXThey have related that at a hunting seat they were roasting some gamefor Nushirowan, and as there was no salt they were despatching a servantto the village to fetch some. Nushirowan called to him, saying, "Take itat its fair price, and not by force, lest a bad precedent be establishedand the village desolated." They asked, "What damage can ensue from thistrifle?" He answered, "Originally, the basis of oppression in this worldwas small, and every newcomer added to it, till it reached to itspresent extent:--Let the monarch eat but one apple from a peasant'sorchard, and his guards, or slaves, will pull up the tree by its root.From the plunder of five eggs, that the king shall sanction, his troopswill stick a thousand fowls on their spits."XXI have heard of a revenue-collector who would distrain the huts of thepeasantry, that he might enrich the treasury of the sovereign,regardless of that maxim of the wise, who have said, "Whoever can offendthe Most High, that he may gain the heart of a fellow-creature, God onhigh will instigate that creature against him, till he dig out thefoundation of his fortune:--That crackling in the flame is not caused byburning rue, but it is the sigh of the afflicted that occasions it."They say, of all animals the lion is the chief; and of beasts the ass isthe meanest; yet, with the concurrence of the wise, the burden-bearingass is preferable to the man-devouring lion. "The poor ass, thoughdevoid of understanding, will be held precious when carrying a burden;oxen and asses that carry loads are preferable to men that injure theirfellow-creatures."The king had reported to him a part of his nefarious conduct. He put himto the rack, and tortured him to death. "Thou canst not obtain thesovereign's approbation till thou make sure of the good-will of hispeople. Wishest thou that God shall be bountiful to thee, be thou goodthyself to the creatures of God."One who had suffered from his oppression passed him at the time of hisexecution, and said: "It is not every man that may have the strong armof high station, that can in his government take an immoderate freedomwith the subjects' property. It is possible to cram a bone down thethroat, but when it sticks at the navel it will burst open the belly."XXIThey tell a story of an evil-disposed person who struck a pious good manon the head with a stone. Having no power of revenge, the dervish waskeeping the stone by him till an occasion when the sovereign let loosethe army of his wrath, and cast him into a dungeon. The poor man went upand flung that stone at his head. The person spoke to him, saying, "Whoare you, and why did you throw this stone at my head?" He answered, "Iam that poor man, and this is the same stone that you on a certainoccasion flung at my head." He said, "Where have you been all thistime?" The poor man answered, "I stood in awe of your high station, butnow that I find you in a dungeon, I avail myself of the opportunity, asthey have said--'Whilst they saw the worthless man in prosperity, thewise thought proper to show him respect. Now thou hast not sharp andtearing nails, it is prudent for thee to defer to engage with thewicked. Whoever grappled with a steel-armed wrist exposed his own silverarm to torture. Wait till fortune can manacle his hands, then beat outhis brains to the satisfaction of thy friends.'"       *       *       *       *       *XXIIIOne of King Umraw-layas's slaves had absconded, and people that wentafter him brought him back. The vizir, who had a dislike to him, usedhis interest to have him put to death, that the other slaves (as hepretended) might not commit the same offence. The poor slave fell atUmraw-layas's feet, and said: "Whatever may befall me, if thou approveof it, it is so far proper. What plea can a vassal offer against hislord and master's decree?--Nevertheless, inasmuch as I am the nurturedgift of this house, I could not wish that on the last day's reckoning myblood should stand charged to your account. If, at all events, you areresolved to put this your slave to death, let it be done with a plea oflegality, that you may not be censured at the day of resurrection." Theking asked, "How can I set up a legal plea?" He replied, "Issue yourcommand that I may kill the vizir, then give an order to put me to deathin retaliation for him, that you may kill me according to law!" The kingsmiled and asked the vizir, "What is your advice in this case?" Thevizir said, "O sovereign of the world! I beg, for the sake of God, thatyou will manumit this audacious fellow as a propitiation at the tomb ofyour forefathers, lest he also involve me in calamity. The fault was onmy side, in not doing justice to the saying of the wise, who have warnedus:--'When thou didst enter the lists with a practised slinger, in thywant of skill thou exposest thine own head to be broken. When thou didstdischarge thine arrow at thy antagonist's face thou shouldst have beenupon thy guard, for thou hadst become his butt.'"XXIVKing Zuzan had a minister of a generous spirit and kindly disposition,who was polite to all persons while present, and spoke well of them whenabsent. One of his acts happened to displease the king, who put himunder stoppages, and in rigorous confinement. The officers of the crownwere sensible of his former benefits, and pledged to show theirgratitude of them. Accordingly, whilst under their charge, they treatedhim with courtesy and benevolence, and would not use any coercion orviolence:--"If thou desirest to remain at peace with a rival, wheneverhe slanders thee behind thy back speak well of him to his face. Theperverse man cavils for the last word; unless thou preferest his bitterremarks, make his mouth sweet."Of the charge against him at the king's exchequer, part had beenadjusted according to its settlement, and he remained in durance for thebalance. A bordering prince sent him underhand a letter, stating, "Thesovereign of that quarter has not appreciated such worth, nay, hasdishonored it, and with us it bore a heavy price. If the precious mindof a certain personage, may God facilitate his deliverance, will inclinefavorably towards us, every possible exertion shall be made toconciliate his good-will, and the cabinet ministers of this kingdom areexulting in the prospect of seeing him, and anxious for the answer ofthis letter." The minister made himself master of the contents. Hepondered on the danger, wrote such a brief answer as seemed discreetupon the back of the letter, and returned it. One of the hangers-on atcourt had notice of this circumstance. He apprised the king, saying, "Acertain person whom you have put in confinement is corresponding with aneighboring prince." The king was wroth, and ordered an investigation ofthis intelligence. The messenger was seized, and letter read. On theback of it he had written, stating, "The good opinion of his Majestyexceeds the merits of this slave; but the honored approbation he hasbestowed upon a servant cannot possibly have his consent, for he is thefostered gift of this house, and he cannot, on a trifling change ofaffection, betray his ancient benefactor and patron.--Though once in hislife he may grate thee with harshness, excuse him who on every occasionelse has soothed thee with kindness." The king commended his fidelity,bestowed on him an honorary dress and largess, and made his excuses,saying, "I was to blame, that could do you an injury." He replied, "Inthis instance, my lord, your servant sees no blame that attaches to you;but such was the ordination of God, whose name was glorified, that thisyour devoted slave should verily be overtaken with a calamity.Accordingly, it is more tolerable at the hand of you, who possess therights of past good, and have claims of gratitude on this servant:--Benot offended with mankind should any mischief assail thee, for neitherpleasure nor pain originate with thy fellow-being. Know that thecontrariety of foe and friend proceeds from God, and that the hearts ofboth are at his disposal. Though the arrow may seem to issue from thebow, the intelligent can see that the archer gave it its aim."XXVI have heard that one of the kings of Arabia directed the officers ofhis treasury, saying, "You will double a certain person's salary,whatever it may be, for he is constant in attendance and ready fororders, while the other courtiers are diverted by play, and negligent oftheir duty." A good and holy man overheard this, and heaved a sigh andgroan from the bottom of his bosom. They asked, saying, "What vision didyou see?" He replied, "The exalted mansions of his devoted servants willbe after this manner portioned out at the judgment-seat of a Most Highand Mighty Deity!--If for two mornings a person is assiduous about theperson of the king, on the third he will in some shape regard him withaffection. The sincerely devout exist in the hope that they shall notdepart disappointed from God's threshold. The rank of a prince is thereward of obedience. Disobedience to command is a proof of rejection.Whoever has the aspect of the upright and good will lay the face of dutyat this threshold."XXVIThey tell a story of a tyrant who bought fire-wood from the poor at alow price, and sold it to the rich at an advance. A good and holy manwent up to him and said, "Thou art a snake, who bitest everybody thouseest; or an owl, who diggest up and makest a ruin of the place wherethou sittest:--Although thy injustice may pass unpunished among us, itcannot escape God, the knower of secrets. Be not unjust with the peopleof this earth, that their complaints may not rise up to heaven."They say the unjust man was offended at his words, turned aside hisface, and showed him no civility, as they have expressed it (in theKoran):--_He, the glorified God, overtook him amidst his sins_:--tillone night, when the fire of his kitchen fell upon the stack of wood,consumed all his property, and laid him from the bed of voluptuousnessupon the ashes of hell torments. That good and holy man happened to bepassing and observed that he was remarking to his friends, "I cannotfancy whence this fire fell upon my dwelling." He said, "From the smokeof the hearts of the poor!--Guard against the smoke of thesore-afflicted heart, for an inside sore will at last gather into ahead. Give nobody's heart pain so long as thou canst avoid it, for onesigh may set a whole world into a flame."They have related that these verses were inscribed in golden lettersupon Kai-khosrau's crown:--"How many years, and what a continuance ofages, that mankind shall on this earth walk over my head. As the kingdomcame to me from hand to hand, so it shall pass into the hands ofothers."XXVIIA person had become a master in the art of wrestling; he knew threehundred and sixty sleights in this art, and could exhibit a fresh trickfor every day throughout the year. Perhaps owing to a liking that acorner of his heart took for the handsome person of one of his scholars,he taught him three hundred and fifty-nine of those feats, but he wasputting off the instruction of one, and under some pretence deferringit.In short the youth became such a proficient in the art and talent ofwrestling that none of his contemporaries had ability to cope with him,till he at length had one day boasted before the reigning sovereign,saying, "To any superiority my master possesses over me, he is beholdento my reverence of his seniority, and in virtue of his tutorage;otherwise I am not inferior in power, and am his equal in skill." Thiswant of respect displeased the king. He ordered a wrestling match to beheld, and a spacious field to be fenced in for the occasion. Theministers of state, nobles of the court, and gallant men of the realmwere assembled, and the ceremonials of the combat marshalled. Like ahuge and lusty elephant, the youth rushed into the ring with such acrash that had a brazen mountain opposed him he would have moved it fromits base. The master being aware that the youth was his superior instrength, engaged him in that strange feat of which he had kept himignorant. The youth was unacquainted with its guard. Advancing,nevertheless, the master seized him with both hands, and, lifting himbodily from the ground, raised him above his head and flung him on theearth. The crowd set up a shout. The king ordered them to give themaster an honorary dress and handsome largess, and the youth headdressed with reproach and asperity, saying, "You played the traitorwith your own patron, and failed in your presumption of opposing him."He replied, "O sire! my master did not overcome me by strength andability, but one cunning trick in the art of wrestling was left which hewas reserved in teaching me, and by that little feat had to-day theupper hand of me." The master said, "I reserved myself for such a day asthis. As the wise have told us, 'Put it not so much into a friend'spower that, if hostilely disposed, he can do you an injury.' Have younot heard what that man said who was treacherously dealt with by his ownpupil:--'Either in fact there was no good faith in this world, or nobodyhas perhaps practised it in our days. No person learned the art ofarchery from me who did not in the end make me his butt.'"XXVIIIA solitary dervish had taken up his station at the corner of a desert. Aking was passing by him. Inasmuch as contentment is the enjoyment of akingdom, the dervish did not raise his head, nor show him the least markof attention; and, inasmuch as sovereignty is regal pomp, the king tookoffence, and said, "The tribe of ragged mendicants resemble brutebeasts, and have neither grace nor good manners." The vizir stepped upto him, and said: "O generous man! the sovereign of the universe haspassed by you; why did you not do him homage, and discharge the duty ofobeisance?" He answered and said, "Speak to your sovereign, saying:Expect service from that person who will court your favor; let himmoreover know that kings are meant for the protection of the people, andnot the people for the subjects of kings.--Though it be for theirbenefit that his glory is exalted, yet is the king but the shepherd ofthe poor. The sheep are not intended for the service of the shepherd,but the shepherd is appointed to tend the sheep.--To-day thou mayestobserve one man proud from prosperity, another with a heart sore fromadversity; have patience for a few days till the dust of the grave canconsume the brain of that vain and foolish head. When the record ofdestiny came to take effect, the distinction of liege and subjectdisappeared. Were a person to turn up the dust of the defunct, he couldnot distinguish that of the rich man from the poor."These sayings made a strong impression upon the king; he said: "Ask mefor something." He replied: "What I desire is, that you will not troubleme again!" The king said, "Favor me with a piece of advice." Heanswered: "Attend to them now that the good things of this life are inthy hands; for wealth and dominion are passing from one hand intoanother."       *       *       *       *       *XXXA king ordered an innocent person to be put to death. The man said,"Seek not your own hurt by venting any anger you may entertain againstme." The king asked, "How?" He replied, "The pain of this punishmentwill continue with me for a moment, but the sin of it will endure withyou forever.--The period of this life passes by like the wind of thedesert. Joy and sorrow, beauty and deformity, equally pass away. Thetyrant vainly thought that he did me an injury, but round his neck itclung and passed over me."The king profited by this advice, spared his life, and asked hisforgiveness.XXXIThe cabinet ministers of Nushirowan were debating an important affair ofstate, and each delivered his opinion according to the best of hisjudgment. In like manner the king also delivered his sentiments, andAbu-zarchamahr, the prime minister, accorded in opinion with him. Theother ministers whispered him, saying, "What did you see superior in theking's opinion that you preferred it to the judgment of so many wiseheads?" He replied: "Because the event is doubtful, and the opinion ofall rests in the pleasure of the most high God whether it shall be rightor wrong. Accordingly it is safer to conform with the judgment of theking, because if that shall prove wrong, our obsequiousness to his willshall secure us from his displeasure.--To sport an opinion contrary tothe judgment of the king were to wash our hands in our own blood. Werehe verily to say this day is night, it would behoove us to reply: Lo!there are the moon and seven stars."XXXIIAn impostor plaited his hair and spake, saying, "I am a descendant ofAli;" and he entered the city along with the caravan from Hijaz, saying,"I come a pilgrim from Mecca;" and he presented a Casidah or elegy tothe king, saying, "I have composed it!" The king gave him money, treatedhim with respect, and ordered him to be shown much flattering attention;till one of the courtiers, who had that day returned from a voyage atsea, said, "I saw him on the Eeduzha, or anniversary of sacrifice atBusrah; how then can he be a Haji, or pilgrim?" Another said, "Now Irecollect him, his father was a Christian at Malatiyah (Malta); how thencan he be a descendant of Ali?" And they discovered his verses in thedivan of Anwari. The king ordered that they should beat and drive himaway, saying, "How came you to utter so many falsehoods?" He replied, "Osovereign of the universe! I will utter one speech more, and if that maynot prove true, I shall deserve whatever punishment you may command."The king asked, "What may that be?" He said: "If a peasant bring thee acup of junket, two measures of it will be water and one spoonful of itbuttermilk. If thy slave spake idly be not offended, for greattravellers deal most in the marvellous!" The king smiled and replied,"You never in your life spake a truer word." He directed them to gratifyhis expectations, and he departed happy and content.XXXIIIThey have related that one of the vizirs would compassionate the weakand meditate the good of everybody. He happened to fall under the royaldispleasure, and they all strove to obtain his release. Such as had himin custody were indulgent in their restraint, and his fellow-grandeeswere loud in proclaiming his virtues, till the king pardoned his fault.A good and holy man was apprised of these events, and said:--"In orderto conciliate the good-will of friends, it were better to sell ourpatrimonial garden; in order to boil the pot of well-wishers, it weregood to convert our household furniture into fire-wood. Do good even tothe wicked; it is as well to shut a dog's mouth with a crumb."XXXIVOne of Harun-al-Rashid's children went up to his father in a passion,saying, "A certain officer's son has abused me in my mother's name."Harun asked his ministers, "What ought to be such a person'spunishment?" One made a sign to have him put to death; another to havehis tongue cut out; and a third, to have him fined and banished. Harunsaid: "O my child! it were generous to forgive him; but if you have notresolution to do that, do you abuse his mother in return, yet not tosuch a degree as to exceed the bounds of retaliation, for in that casethe injury would be on our part, and the complaint on that of theantagonist.--In the opinion of the prudent he is no hero that can dareto combat a furious elephant; but that man is in truth a hero who, whenprovoked to anger, will not speak intemperately. A cross-grained fellowabused a certain person; he bore it patiently, and said, O well-disposedman! I am still more wicked than thou art calling me; for I know mydefects better than thou canst know them."XXXVI was seated in a vessel, along with some persons of distinction, when aboat sunk astern of us and two brothers were drawn into the whirlpool.One of our gentlemen called to the pilot, saying, "Save those twodrowning men and I will give you a hundred dinars." The pilot went andrescued one of them, but the other perished. I observed, "That man'stime was come, therefore you were tardy in assisting him, and alert insaving this other." The pilot smiled, and replied, "What you say is theessence of inevitable necessity; yet was my zeal more hearty in rescuingthis one, because on an occasion when I was tired in the desert he setme on a camel; whereas, when a boy, I had received a horsewhipping fromthat other."--_God Almighty was all justice and equity: whoever laboredunto good experienced good in himself; and he who toiled unto evilexperienced evil_.--So long as thou art able grate nobody's heart, forin this path there must be thorns. Expedite the concerns of the poor andneedy; for thy own concerns may need to be expedited.       *       *       *       *       *XXXVIIA person announced to Nushirowan the Just, saying, "I have heard thatGod, glorious and great, has removed from this world a certain man whowas your enemy." He said, "Have you had any intelligence that he hasoverlooked me? In the death of a rival I have no room for exultation,since my life also is not to last forever."XXXVIIIAt the court of Kisra, or Nushirowan, a cabinet council was debatingsome state affair. Abu-zarchamahr, who sat as president, was silent.They asked him, "Why do you not join us in this discussion?" He replied,"Such ministers of state are like physicians, and a physician willprescribe a medicine only to a sick man; accordingly, so long as I seethat your opinions are judicious, it were ill-judged in me to obtrude aword.--While business can proceed without my interference, it does notbehoove me to speak on the subject; but were I to see a blind manwalking into a pit, I would be much to blame if I remained silent."XXXIXWhen he reduced the kingdom of Misr, or Egypt, to obedience,Harun-al-Rashid said, "In contempt of that impious rebel (Pharaoh), who,in his pride of the sovereignty of Egypt, boasted a divinity, I willbestow its government only on the vilest of my slaves." He had a negrobondsman, called Khosayib, preciously stupid, and him he appointed torule over Egypt. They tell us that his judgment and understanding weresuch, that when a body of farmers complained to him, saying, "We hadplanted some cotton shrubs on the banks of the Nile, and the rains cameunseasonably, and swept them all away;"--he replied, "You ought to sowwool, that it might not be swept away!" A good and holy man heard this,and said: "Were our fortune to be increased in proportion to ourknowledge, none could be scantier than the share of the fool; butfortune will bestow such wealth upon the ignorant as shall astonish ahundred of the learned. Power and fortune depend not on knowledge, theyare obtained only through the aid of heaven; for it has often happenedin this world that the illiterate are honored, and the wise held inscorn. The fool in his idleness found a treasure under a ruin; thechemist, or projector, fell the victim of disappointment and chagrin."CHAPTER IIOf the Morals of DervishesIA person of distinction asked a parsa, or devout and holy man, saying,"What do you offer in justification of a certain abid, another speciesof Mohammedan monk, whose character others have been so ready toquestion?" He replied: "In his outward behavior I see nothing to blame,and with the secrets of his heart I claim no acquaintance.--Whomsoeverthou seest in a parsa's habit, consider him a parsa, or holy, and esteemhim as a good man; and if thou knowest not what is passing in his mind,what business has the mohtasib, or censor, with the inside of thehouse?"III saw a dervish who, having laid his head at the fane of the Cabah ofMecca, was complaining and saying, "O gracious, O merciful God! thouknowest what can proceed from the sinful and ignorant that may be worthyof thy acceptance!--I brought my excuse of imperfect performance, for Ihave no claim on the score of obedience. The wicked repent them of theirsins; such as know God confess a deficiency of worship."Abids, or the pious, seek a reward of their devotion, merchants a profiton their traffic. I, a devoted servant, have brought hope, notobedience, and have come as a beggar, and not for lucre!--_Do unto mewhat is worthy of thyself; but deal not with me as I myself havedeserved_.--Whether thou wilt slay me or pardon my offence, my head andface are prostrate at thy threshold. Thy servant has no will of his own;whatever thou commandest, that he will perform. At the door of the CabahI saw a petitioner, who was praying and weeping bitterly. I ask not,saying, "Approve of my obedience, but draw the pen of forgiveness acrossmy sins."IIIWithin the sanctuary of the Cabah, at Mecca, I saw Abd-u'l-cadur theGilani, who having laid his face upon the Hasa, or black stone, wassaying, "Spare and pardon me, O God! and if, at all events, I am doomedto punishment, raise me up at the day of resurrection blindfolded, thatI may not be put to shame in the eyes of the righteous." Every morningwhen the day begins to dawn, with my face in the dust of humility, I amsaying, "O thou, whom I never can forget, dost thou ever bestow athought on thy servant?"IVA thief got into a holy man's cell; but, however much he searched, hecould find nothing to steal, and was going away disappointed. The goodsoul was aware of what was passing, and taking up the rug on which hehad slept, he put it in his way that he might not miss his object.--Ihave heard that the heroes on the path of God will not distress thehearts of their enemies. How canst thou attain this dignified stationwho art at strife and warfare with thy friends?The loving kindness of the righteous, whether before your face or behindyour back, is not such that they will censure you when absent, and offerto die for you when present.--Face to face meek as a lamb, behind yourback like a man-devouring wolf. Whoever brings you, and sums up thefaults of others, will doubtless expose your defects to them.VSome travelling mendicants had agreed to club in a body and participatein the cares and comforts of society. I expressed a wish that I might beone of the party, but they refused to admit me. I said: "It is rare andinconsistent with the generous dispositions of dervishes to turn theirfaces from a good-fellowship with the poor, and to deny them itsbenefits, for on my part I feel such a zeal and good-will, that in theservice of the liberal I am likely to prove rather an active associatethan a grievous load.--_Though not one of those who are mounted on thecamels, I will do my best, that I may carry their saddle-cloths_."One of them answered and said: "Be not offended at what you have heard,for some days back a thief joined us in the garb of a dervish, andstrung himself upon the cord of our acquaintance.--How can people knowwhat he is that wears that dress? The writer can alone tell thecontents of the letter." In consequence of that reverence in which thedervish character is held, they did not think of his profligacy andadmitted him into their society. The outward character of the holy is apatched cloak; this much is sufficient, that it has a threadbare hood.Be industrious in thy calling, and wear whatever dress thou choosest.Put a diadem on thy head, and bear a standard on thy shoulder. Holinessdoes not consist in a coarse frock. Let a zahid, or holy man, be trulypious, and he may dress in satin. Sanctity is not merely a change ofdress; it is an abandonment of the world, its pomp and vanity. Itrequires a hero to wear a coat of mail, for what would it profit todress an hermaphrodite, or coward, in a suit of armor?In short we had one day travelled till dark, and at night composedourselves for sleep under the wall of a castle. That graceless thieftook up his neighbor's ewer, saying, "I am going to my ablutions;" andhe was setting out for plunder. Behold a religious man, who threw apatched cloak over his shoulders; he made the covering of the Cabah thehousing of an ass. So soon as he got out of the sight of the dervishes,he scaled a bastion of the fort and stole a casket. Before break of daythat gloomy-minded robber had got a great way off, and left his innocentcompanions asleep. In the morning they were all carried into thecitadel, and thrown into a dungeon. From that time we have declined anyaddition to our party, and kept apart to ourselves, _for there is safetyin unity, but danger in duality or a multitude_.--When an individual ofa sect committed an act of folly, the high and the low sunk in theirdignity. Dost thou not see that one ox in a pasturage will cast a slurupon all the oxen of the village?I said: "Let there be thanksgiving to a Deity of majesty and glory thatI am not forbid the benefits of dervishes, notwithstanding I am inappearance excluded from their society; and I am instructed by thisnarration, and others like me may profit by its moral during theirremaining lives.--From one indiscreet person in an assembly a host ofthe prudent may get hurt. If they fill a cistern to the brim withrose-water, and let a dog fall into it, the whole will becontaminated."VIA zahid was the guest of a king. When he sat down at table he ate moresparingly from that than his appetite inclined him, and when he stood upat prayers he continued longer at them than it was his custom; that theymight form a high opinion of his sanctity.--I fear, O Arab! that thouwilt not reach the Caabah; for the road that thou art taking leads toTurkistan, or the region of infidels.When he returned home he ordered the table to be spread that he mighteat. His son was a youth of a shrewd understanding. He said: "O father,perhaps you ate little or nothing at the feast of the king?" Heanswered, "In his presence I ate scarce anything that could answer itspurpose!" Then retorted the boy, "Repeat also your prayers, that nothingbe omitted that can serve a purpose." Yes, thy virtues thou hast exposedin the palm of thy hand, thy vices thou hast hid under thy arm-pit. Takeheed, O hypocrite, what thou wilt be able to purchase with this basemoney on the day of need or day of judgment.VIII remember that in my early youth I was overmuch religious and vigilant,and scrupulously pious and abstinent. One night I sat up in attendanceon my father, on whom be God's mercy, never once closed my eyes duringthe whole night, and held the precious Koran open on my lap, while thecompany around us were fast asleep. I said to my father: "Not anindividual of these will raise his head that he may perform hisgenuflections, or ritual of prayer; but they are all so sound asleep,that you might conclude they were dead." He replied: "O emanation ofyour father, you had also better have slept than that you should thuscalumniate the failings of mankind.--The braggart can discern only hisown precious person; he will draw the veil of conceit all around him.Were fortune to bestow upon him God's all-searching eye, he would findnobody weaker than himself."       *       *       *       *       *XOn one occasion, at the metropolitan mosque of Balbek, I was holdingforth, by way of admonition to a congregation cold and dead at heart,and not to be moved from the materialism of this world into the paths ofmysticism. I perceived that the spirit of my discourse was making noimpression, nor were the sparks of my enthusiasm likely to strike fireinto their humid wood. I grew weary of instructing brutes, and ofholding up a mirror to an assembly of the blind; but the door ofexposition was thrown open, and the chain of argument extended; and inexplanation of this text in the Koran--_We are nearer to him_ (God)_than the vein of his neck_.--I had reached that passage of my sermonwhere I thus express myself:--"Such a mistress as is closer to me in heraffection than I am to myself, but this is marvellous that I amestranged from her. What shall I say, and to whom can I tell it, thatshe lies on my bosom and I am alienated from her."The intoxicating spirit of this discourse ran into my head, and thedregs of the cup still rested in my hand, when a traveller, as passingby, entered the outer circle of the congregation, and its expiringundulation lit upon him. He sent forth such a groan that the others insympathy with him joined in lamentation, and the rawest of the assemblybubbled in unison. I exclaimed, "Praise be to God! those far off arepresent in their knowledge, and those near by are distant from theirignorance. If the hearer has not the faculty of comprehending thesermon, expect not the vigor of genius in the preacher. Give a scope tothe field of inclination, that the orator may have room to strike theball of eloquence over it."XIOne night in the desert of Mecca, from an excess of drowsiness, I hadnot a foot to enable me to proceed; and, laying my head on the earth, Igave myself up for lost, and desired the camel-driver to leave me to myfate.--How could the foot of the poor jaded pedestrian go on, now thatthe Bactrian dromedary got impatient of its burden? While the body of afat man is getting lean, a lean man must fall the victim of a hardship.The camel-driver replied: "O brother, holy Mecca is ahead, and theprofane robber behind; if you come forward you escape, but if you stayhere you die!" During the night journey of the caravan, and in the trackof the desert, it is fascinating to dose under the acacia-thorn tree;but, on this indulgence, we must resign all thoughts of surviving it.XIII saw on the sea-shore a holy man who had been torn by a tiger, andcould get no salve to heal his wound. For a length of time he sufferedmuch pain, and was all along offering thanks to the Most High. Theyasked him, saying, "Why are you so grateful?" He answered, "God bepraised that I am overtaken with misfortune and not with sin! Were thatbeloved friend, God, to give me over to death, take heed, and think notthat I should be solicitous about life. I would ask, What hast thou seenamiss in thy poor servant that thy heart should take offence at me? forthat could alone give me a moment's uneasiness."XIIIHaving some pressing occasion, a dervish stole a rug from the hut of afriend. The judge ordered that they should cut off his hand. The ownerof the rug made intercession for him, saying, "I have forgiven him." Thejudge replied, "At your instance I cannot relax the extreme sentence ofthe law." He said: "In what you ordered you spoke justly. Nevertheless,whoever steals a portion of any property dedicated to alms must notsuffer the forfeiture of his hand, for a _religious mendicant is not theproprietor of anything_; and whatever appertains to dervishes is devotedto the necessitous." The judge withdrew his hand from punishing him, andby way of reprimand asked, "Had the world become so circumscribed thatyou could not commit a theft but in the dwelling of such a friend?" Heanswered, "Have you not heard what they have said, 'Sweep everythingaway from the houses of your friends, but knock not at the doors of yourenemies.' When overwhelmed with calamity let not thy body pine inmisery. Strip thy foes of their skins, and thy friends of theirjackets."XIVA king said to a holy man, "Are you ever thinking of me?" "Yes," repliedhe, "at such time as I am forgetting God Almighty! He will wander allaround whom God shall drive from his gate; and he will not let him go toanother door whom he shall direct into his own."XVOne of the righteous in a dream saw a king in paradise, and a parsa, orholy man, in hell. He questioned himself, saying, "What is the cause ofthe exaltation of this, and the degradation of that, for we have fanciedtheir converse?" A voice came from above, answering, "This king is inheaven because of his affection for the holy, and that parsa is in hellbecause of his connection with the kingly."--What can a coarse frock,rosary, and patched cloak avail? Abstain from such evil works as maydefile thee. There is no occasion to put a felt cowl upon thy head. Be adervish in thy actions, and wear a Tartarian coronet.XVIA pedestrian, naked from head to foot, left Cufah with the caravan ofpilgrims for Hijaz, or Mecca, and came along with us. I looked at andsaw him destitute of every necessary for the journey; yet he wascheerfully pushing on, and bravely remarking:--"I am neither mounted ona camel nor a mule under a burden. I am neither the lord of vassals northe vassal of a lord. I think not of present sorrows or past vanities,but breathe the breath of ease and live the life of freedom!"A gentleman mounted on a camel said to him, "O dervish, whither are yougoing? return, or you must perish miserably." He did not heed what hesaid, but entered the desert on foot and proceeded. On our reaching thepalm plantation of Mahmud, fate overtook the rich man, and he died. Thedervish went up to his bier and said, "I did not perish amidst hardshipon foot, and you expired on a camel's back." A person sat all nightweeping by the side of a sick friend. Next day he died, and the invalidrecovered!--Yes! many a fleet horse perished by the way, and that lameass reached the end of the journey. How many of the vigorous and haledid they put underground, and that wounded man recovered!       *       *       *       *       *XVIIIIn the territory of the Greeks a caravan was attacked by robbers, andplundered of much property. The merchants set up a lamentation andcomplaint, and besought the intercession of God and the prophet; but allto no purpose.--When the gloomy-minded robber is flushed with victory,what will he feel for the traveller's despair.Lucman, the fabulist and philosopher, happened to be among them. One ofthe travellers spoke to him, saying, "Direct some maxims of wisdom andadmonition to them; perhaps they may restore a part of our goods; for itwere a pity that articles of such value should be cast away." Heanswered: "It were a pity to cast away the admonitions of wisdom uponthem!" From that iron which the rust has corroded thou canst noteradicate the canker with a file. What purpose will it answer to preachto the gloomy-minded infidel? A nail of iron cannot penetrate into apiece of flint.Perhaps the fault has been on our part (in not being charitable), asthey have said:--"On the day of thy prosperity remember the bankrupt andneedy, for by visiting the hearts of the poor with charity thou shaltdivert calamity. When the beggar solicits alms from thee, bestow it witha good grace; otherwise the tyrant may come and take it by force."       *       *       *       *       *XXThey asked Lucman, the fabulist, "From whom did you learn manners?" Heanswered, "From the unmannerly, for I was careful to avoid whatever partof their behavior seemed to me bad." They will not speak a word in jokefrom which the wise cannot derive instruction; let them read a hundredchapters of wisdom to a fool, and they will all seem but a jest to him.XXIThey tell a story of an abid, who in the course of a night would eat tenmans, or pounds, of food, and in his devotions repeat the whole Koranbefore morning. A good and holy man heard this, and said, "Had he eatenhalf a loaf of bread, and gone to sleep, he would have done a moremeritorious act." Keep thy inside unencumbered with victuals, that thelight of good works may shine within thee; but thou art void of wisdomand knowledge, because thou art filled up to the nose with food.XXIIThe divine favor had placed the lamp of grace in the path of a wandererin forbidden ways, till it directed him into the circle of therighteous, and the blessed society of dervishes, and their spiritualco-operation enabled him to convert his wicked propensities intopraiseworthy deeds, and to restrain himself in sensual indulgences; yetwere the tongues of calumniators questioning his sincerity, and saying,He retains his original habits, and there is no trusting to his pietyand goodness.--By the means of repentance thou mayest get delivered fromthe wrath of God, but there is no escape from the slanderous tongue ofman.--He was unable to put up with the virulence of their remarks, andtook his complaint to his ghostly father, saying, "I am much troubled bythe tongues of mankind." The holy man wept, and answered, "How can yoube sufficiently grateful for this blessing, that you are better thanthey represent you?--How often wilt thou call aloud saying, Themalignant and envious are calumniating wretched me, that they rise up toshed my blood, and that they sit down to devise me mischief. Be thougood thyself, and let people speak evil of thee; it is better than to bewicked, and that they should consider thee as good."--But, on the otherhand, behold me, of whose perfectness all entertain the best opinion,while I am the mirror of imperfection.--Had I done what they have said,I should have been a pious and moral man.--_Verily, I may conceal myselffrom the sight of my neighbor, but God knows what is secret and what isopen_.--There is a shut door between me and mankind, that they may notpry into my sins; but what, O Omniscience! can a closed door availagainst thee, who art equally informed of what is manifest or concealed?XXIIII lodged a complaint with one of our reverend Shaikhs, saying: "Acertain person has borne testimony against my character on the score oflasciviousness." He answered, "Shame him by your continence.--Be thouvirtuously disposed, that the detractor may not have it in his power toindulge his malignity. So long as the harp is in tune, how can it haveits ear pulled (or suffer correction by being put in tune) by theminstrel?"XXIVThey asked one of the Shaikhs of Sham, or Syria, saying: "What is thecondition of the Sufi sect?" He answered, "Formerly they were in thisworld a fraternity dispersed in the flesh, but united in the spirit; butnow they are a body well clothed carnally, and ragged in divinemystery." Whilst thy heart will be every moment wandering into adifferent place, in thy recluse state thou canst not see purity; butthough thou possessest rank and wealth, lands and chattels, if thy heartbe fixed on God, thou art a hermit.XXVOn one occasion we had marched, I recollect, all the night along withthe caravan, and halted towards morning on the skirts of the wilderness.One mystically distracted, who accompanied us on that journey, set up aloud lamentation at dawn, went a-wandering into the desert, and did nottake a moment's rest. Next day I said to him, "What condition was that?"He replied, "I remarked the nightingales that they had come to carol inthe groves, the pheasants to prattle on the mountains, the frogs tocroak in the pools, and the wild beasts to roar in the forests, andthought with myself, saying, It cannot be generous that all are awake inGod's praise and I am wrapt up in the sleep of forgetfulness!--Lastnight a bird was carolling towards the morning; it stole my patienceand reason, my fortitude and understanding. My lamentation had perhapsreached the ear of one of my dearly-beloved friends. He said, 'I did notbelieve that the singing of a bird could so distract thee!' I answered,This is not the duty of the human species, that the birds are singingGod's praise and that I am silent."XXVIOnce, on a pilgrimage to Hijaz, I was the fellow-traveller of somepiously-disposed young men, and on a footing of familiarity and intimacywith them. From time to time we were humming a tune and chanting aspiritual hymn, and an abid, who bore us company, kept disparaging themorals of the dervishes, and was callous to their sufferings, till wereached the palm plantation of the tribe of Hulal, when a boy of a tawnycomplexion issued from the Arab horde and sung such a plaintive melodyas would arrest the bird in its flight through the air. I remarked theabid's camel that it kicked up and pranced, and, throwing the abid,danced into the wilderness. I said: "O reverend Shaikh! that spiritualstrain threw a brute into an ecstasy, and it is not in like mannerworking a change in you!--Knowest thou what that nightingale of the dawnwhispered to me? What sort of man art thou, indeed, who art ignorant oflove?--The camel is in an ecstasy of delight from the Arab's song. Ifthou hast no taste to relish this, thou art a cross-grained brute.--Nowthat the camel is elated with rapture and delight, if a man isinsensible to these he is an ass.--_The zephyr, gliding through theverdure on the earth, shakes the twig of the ban-tree, but moves not thesolid rock_.--Whatever thou beholdest is loud in extolling him. Thatheart which has an ear is full of the divine mystery. It is not thenightingale that alone serenades his rose; for every thorn on therose-bush is a tongue in his or God's praise!"XXVIIA king had reached the end of his days and had no heir to succeed him.He made his will, stating, "You will place the crown of sovereignty uponthe head of whatever person first enters the city gate in the morning,and commit the kingdom to his charge." It happened that the first manthat presented himself at the city gate was a beggar, who had passed hiswhole life in scraping broken meat and in patching rags. The ministersof state and nobles of the court fulfilled the conditions of the king'swill, and laid the keys of the treasury and citadel at his feet.For a time the dervish governed the kingdom, till some of the chiefs ofthe empire swerved from their allegiance, and the princes of theterritories on every side rose in opposition to him, and levied armiesfor the contest. In short, his troops and subjects were routed andsubdued, and several of his provinces taken from him.The dervish was hurt to the soul at these events, when one of his oldfriends, who had been the companion of his state of poverty, returnedfrom a journey and found him in such dignity. He exclaimed:"Thanksgiving be to a Deity of majesty and glory that lofty fortunesuccored you and prosperity was your guide, till roses issued from yourthorns and the thorns were extracted from your feet, and till youarrived at this elevated rank!--_Along with hardship there is ease; or,to sorrow succeeds joy_.--The plant is at one season in flower and atanother withered; the tree is at one time naked and at another clothedwith leaves." He said: "O, my dear friend, offer me condolence, for hereis no place for congratulation. When you last saw me I had to think ofgetting a crumb of bread; now I have the cares of a whole kingdom on myhead. If the world be adverse, we are the victims of pain; ifprosperous, the fettered slaves of affection for it. Amidst this life nocalamity is more afflicting than that, whether fortunate or not, themind is equally disquieted. If thou covetest riches, ask not but forcontentment, which is an immense treasure. Should a rich man throw moneyinto thy lap, take heed, and do not look upon it as a benefit; for Ihave often heard from the great and good that the patience of the pooris more meritorious than the gift of the rich. Were King Bahram Ghor todistribute a whole roasted elk, it would not be equal to the gift of alocust's leg from an ant."XXVIIIA person had a friend who was holding the office of king's divan, orprime minister, and it happened that he had not seen him for some time.Somebody remarked, saying, "It is some time since you saw such agentleman." He answered, "I am no ways anxious about seeing him." One ofthe divan's people chanced to be present. He asked, "What has happenedamiss that you should dislike to visit him?" He replied, "There is nodislike; but my friend, the divan, can be seen at a time when he is outof office, and my idle intrusion might not come amiss." Amidst the statepatronage and authority of office they might take umbrage at theiracquaintance; but on the day of vexation and loss of place they wouldimpart their mental disquietudes to their friends.XXIXAbu-Horairah was making a daily visit to the prophet Mustafa Mohammed,on whom be God's blessing and peace. He said: "_O Abu-Horairah! let mealone every other day, that so affection may increase_; that is, comenot every day, that we may get more loving!"They said to a good and holy man, "Notwithstanding all these charmswhich the sun commands, we have never heard of anybody that has fallenin love with him!" He answered, "It is because he is seen every day,unless during the winter, when he is veiled (in the clouds), and thusmuch coveted and loved."--To visit mankind has no blame in it, but notto such a degree as to let them say, Enough of it. If we see occasion tointerrogate ourselves, we need not listen to the reprehension of others.XXXHaving taken offence with the society of my friends at Damascus, Iretired into the wilderness of the Holy Land, or Jerusalem, and soughtthe company of brutes till such time as I was made a prisoner by theFranks, and employed by them, along with some Jews, in digging earth inthe ditches of Tripoli. At length one of the chiefs of Aleppo, betweenwhom and me an intimacy had of old subsisted, happening to pass thatway, recognized me, and said, "How is this? and how came you to be thusoccupied?" I replied: "What can I say?--I was flying from mankind intothe forests and mountains, for my resource was in God and in none else.Fancy to thyself what my condition must now be, when forced to associatewith a tribe scarcely human?--To be linked in a chain with a company ofacquaintance were pleasanter than to walk in a garden with strangers."He took pity on my situation; and, having for ten dinars redeemed mefrom captivity with the Franks, carried me along with him to Aleppo.Here he had a daughter, and her he gave me in marriage, with a dower ofa hundred dinars. Soon after this damsel turned out a termagant andvixen, and discovered such a perverse spirit and virulent tongue asquite unhinged all my domestic comfort.--A scolding wife in the dwellingof a peaceful man is his hell, even in this world. Protect and guard usagainst a wicked inmate. Save us, O Lord, and preserve us from thefiery, or hell, torture.Having on one occasion given a liberty to the tongue of reproach, shewas saying, "Are you not the fellow whom my father redeemed from thecaptivity of the Franks for ten dinars?" I replied, "Yes, I am that samehe delivered from captivity for ten dinars, and enslaved me with you fora hundred!" I have heard that a reverend and mighty man released a sheepfrom the paws and jaws of a wolf. That same night he was sticking aknife into its throat, when the spirit of the sheep reproached him,saying, "Thou didst deliver me from the clutches of a wolf, when I atlength saw that thou didst prove a wolf to me thyself."       *       *       *       *       *XXXIIIOne of the holy men of Syria had passed many years of devotion in thewilderness, and was feeding on the leaves of trees. The king of thatcountry, in the way of a pilgrimage, visited him, and said, "If you cansee the propriety of removing into my capital I will prepare an abode,where you may perform your devotions more at ease than in this place,and others may benefit by the blessing of your spiritual communion, andbe edified by the example of your pious labors." The hermit was adverseto this advice, and turned away his face. One of the king's ministersspoke to him, saying: "For the satisfaction of his Majesty, it wereproper that you would for a few days remove into the city, and ascertainthe nature of the place; when, if it should prove that your purity mightbe tarnished by coming in contact with the wicked, you have still theoption left of moving back."It is reported that they prevailed on the hermit to accompany them intothe city; and, in a garden near the sacred residence of the king,prepared for him a dwelling, which, like the mansions of paradise, wasrejoicing the heart, and exhilarating the soul.--Its damask roses wereblooming as the cheeks of the lovely, and its tufted spikenard like theringlets of our mistresses. It had as much to fear from the angry blastsof winter as the babe who has not yet tasted its nurse's milk: _boughsof trees on which hung crimson flowers, that gleamed like a flame amidsttheir dusky foliage_.Forthwith the king sent him a moon-faced damsel.--Such was this delicatecrescent of the moon, and fascination of the holy, this form of anangel, and decoration of a peacock, that let them once behold her, andcontinence must cease to exist in the constitutions of the chaste.And, in like manner, there followed her a youth of such rare beauty andexquisite symmetry, that the powerful grasp of his charms had broken thewrists of the pious, and tied up behind their backs the arms of theupright.--Mankind stand around him _parched with thirst, whilst he, whoseems thy cup-bearer, will give thee no drink_.--The eye could not besatiated by beholding him, like the dropsical man with water by lookingat the river Euphrates.The hermit began to relish dainty food, and to wear sumptuous apparel;to regale himself with fruits, perfumes, and sweetmeats; and to beholdwith delight the charms of the handmaid and bondsman. And the wise havesaid, "The ringlets of the lovely are a chain on the feet of reason, anda snare for the bird of wisdom."--To the mystery of thy service Idevoted my heart, religion, and all my mental faculties; verily, I amnow the bird of reason, and thou art the lure and bait.In short, the good fortune of his many years of sanctity ran to waste,as has been said:--"Whatever he had laid up from theologician, sage, orsaint, or of recondite knowledge from the eloquent and pure of spirit,now that he had stooped to mix with a vile world, like the feet of a flyhe got entangled in its honey."The king had the curiosity of making him another visit, and found thehermit much altered from what he first saw of him. His face had becomefair and ruddy, and his body plump and jolly; and he was reclining athis ease on cushions of brocade, and had the Houri-like damsel lollingby his side, and the fairy-formed youth holding a fly-flap of peacock'sfeathers in his hand, and standing by him in attendance. The kingcongratulated him upon his portly appearance, and they entered togetherupon a variety of topics, till his majesty concluded by observing, "Inthis world I have an affection for these two orders of mankind, thelearned and the recluse." A philosophic vizir, and man of much worldlyexperience, happened to be present. He said: "O sire! such is the canonof affection that you should confer a benefit on each. Give money to thelearned man, that he may teach others; and give nothing to the hermit,that he may remain an anchorite.--A zahid, or hermit, stands in need ofneither diram nor dinar; when an anchorite takes either, look out foranother.--Whoever is virtuously disposed, and holds a mysticalcommunication with God, is sufficient of a hermit without requiring thebread of charity, or the crumbs of mendicity. The tapering finger of thelovely, and her soul-deluding ear-lobe, are decoration enough without aturquoise ring or ear-jewel. Tell that piously-disposed andserene-minded dervish that he needs not the bread of consecration orscraping of beggary; tell that handsome and fair-faced matron that shedoes not require paint, coloring, or jewelry.--When I have of my own,and covet what is another's, if they esteem me not a hermit they treatme as I merit."XXXIVConformably with the above apologue, a king had a business of importancein hand. He said: "If this affair prosper to my wish I will distributeamong the recluses a certain sum in dirams." Now his object wasaccomplished, and mind made easy, he thought it incumbent to fulfil thecondition of his eleemosynary vow, and gave a bag of dinars to afavorite servant, that he might distribute them among the anchorites.This was a discreet and considerate young man. He wandered about for thewhole day; and, returning in the evening, kissed the bag of money, andlaid it before the king, saying, "However much I sought after, I havemet with no recluses!" The king answered, "What a story is this? for Imyself know four hundred recluses within this city." He said, "Osovereign of the universe! such as are recluses do not take money; andsuch as take money are not anchorites!" The king smiled, and observed tohis courtiers, "However much I reverence and favor this tribe of God'sworshippers, this saucy fellow expresses for them a spite and ill-will;and, if you desire the truth, he has justice on his side. Instead ofthat hermit who took dirams and dinars, get hold of one who is more ananchorite."XXXVThey asked a profoundly-learned man, saying, "What is your opinion ofconsecrated bread, or almstaking?" He answered, "If with the view ofcomposing their minds, and promoting their devotions, it is lawful totake it; but if monks collect for the sake of an endowment, it isforbidden. Good and holy men have received the bread of consecration forthe sake of religious retirement; and are not recluses, that they mayreceive such bread."XXXVIA dervish came to put up at a place where the master of the house was agentleman of an hospitable disposition. He had as his guests an assemblyof learned and witty men, each of whom was repeating such a jest, oranecdote, as is usual with the facetious. Having travelled across adesert, the dervish was much fatigued, and well-nigh famished. One ofthe company observed, in the way of pleasantry, "You must also repeatsomething." The dervish answered, "I am not, like the others,overstocked with learning and wit, nor am I much read in books; and youmust be satisfied with my reciting one distich." One and all eagerlycried, "Let us hear it." He said, "Hungry as I am, I sit by a tablespread with food, like a bachelor at the entrance of a bath full ofwomen!"They applauded what he said, and ordered the tray to be placed beforehim. The lord of the feast said, "Stay your appetite, my friend! till myhandmaids can prepare for you some forced meat." He raised his head fromthe tray, and answered, "Say there is no need for forced meat on mytray, for a crust of plain bread is sufficient for one baked as I havebeen in the desert."XXXVIIA disciple complained to his ghostly father, saying, "What can I do, forI am much annoyed by the people, who are interrupting me with theirfrequent visits, and break in upon my precious hours with theirimpertinent intrusions." He replied, "To such of them as are poor lendmoney, and from such as are rich ask some in loan; and neither of themwill trouble you again." Let a beggar be the harbinger of an army ofIslam, or the orthodox, and the infidel will fly his importunity as faras the wall of China.       *       *       *       *       *XXXIXA drunken fellow had lain down to sleep on the highway, and was quiteovercome with the fumes of intoxication. An abid was passing close by,and looking at him with scorn. The youth raised his head, and said,"_Whenever they pass anything shameful they pass it withcompassion.--Whenever thou beholdest a sinner, hide and bear with histransgressions: thou, who art aware of them, why not overlook my sinswith pity_?--Turn not away, O reverend sir! from a sinner; but look uponhim with compassion. Though in my actions I am not a hero, do thou passby as the heroic would pass me."XLA gang of dissolute vagabonds broke in upon a dervish, used opprobriouslanguage, and beat and ill-used him. In his helplessness he carried hiscomplaint before his ghostly father, and said, "Thus it has befallenme." He replied: "O my son! the patched cloak of dervishes is thegarment of resignation; whosoever wears this garb, and cannot bear withdisappointment, is a hypocrite, and to him our cloth is forbidden.--Avast and deep river is not rendered turbid by throwing into it a stone.That religious man who can be vexed at an injury is as yet a shallowbrook.--If thou art subjected to trouble, bear with it; for byforgiveness thou art purified from sin. Seeing, O brother! that we areultimately to become dust, be humble as the dust, before thou moulderestinto dust."XLIHear what occurred once at Bagdad in a dispute that took place between aroll-up curtain and standard. Covered with the road-dust, and jaded witha march, the standard, in reproach, observed to the curtain: "Thou and Iare gentlemen in livery; we are fellow-servants at the court of hismajesty. I never enjoy a moment's relief from duty; early and late I amequally marching. Thou hast never experienced any peril or a siege, theheavy sand of the desert or dust of a whirlwind; my foot is most forwardin any enterprise. Then why art thou my superior in dignity? Thou artcared for by youths with faces splendid as the moon, and handled bydamsels scenting like jasmine; while I am fallen into the hands of rawrecruits, am rolled up on our march, and turned upside down." Thecurtain answered: "I lay my head humble at the threshold, and hold itnot up like thine, flaring in the face of heaven! Whoever is thus vainlyrearing his crest exalts himself only to be humbled."XLIIA good and holy man saw a huge and strong fellow, who, having got muchenraged, was storming with passion and foaming at the mouth. He asked,"What has happened to this man?" Somebody answered, "Such a one hasgiven him bad names!" He said, "This paltry wretch is able to carry athousand-weight of stone, and cannot bear with one light word! Cease toboast of thy strong arm and pretended manhood, infirm as thou art inmind, and mean in spirit. What difference is there between such a manand a woman? Though thou art strong of arm, let thy mouth utter sweetwords; it is no proof of courage to thrust thy fist into another man'sface:--Though thou art able to tear the scalp off an elephant, ifdeficient in humanity, thou art no hero. The sons of Adam are formedfrom dust; if not humble as the dust, they fall short of being men."       *       *       *       *       *XLIVA facetious old gentleman of Bagdad gave his daughter in marriage to ashoemaker. The flint-hearted fellow bit so deeply into the damsel's lipthat the blood trickled from the wound. Next morning the father foundher in this plight; he went up to his son-in-law, and asked him, saying:"Lowborn wretch! what sort of teeth are these that thou shouldst chewher lips as if they were a piece of leather? I speak not in play what Ihave to say. Lay jesting aside, and take with her thy legalenjoyment.--When once a vicious disposition has taken root in the habit,the hand of death can only eradicate it."XLVA doctor of laws had a daughter preciously ugly, and she had reached theage of womanhood; but, notwithstanding her dowry and fortune, nobodyseemed inclined to ask her in marriage:--Damask or brocade but add toher deformity when put upon a bride void of symmetry.In short, they were under the necessity of uniting her in the bonds ofwedlock to a blind man. They add, that soon after there arrived fromSirandip, or Ceylon, a physician that could restore sight to the blind.They spoke to the law doctor, saying, "Why do you not get him toprescribe for your son-in-law?" He answered: "Because I am afraid he mayrecover his sight, and repudiate my daughter; for--'the husband of anugly woman should be blind.'"       *       *       *       *       *XLVIIIThey asked a wise man which was preferable, munificence or courage? Heanswered, "Whoever has munificence has no need of courage." On thetombstone of Bahram-gor was inscribed: "The hand of liberality isstronger than the arm of power.--Hatim Tayi remains not, yet will hisexalted name live renowned for generosity to all eternity. Distributethe tithe of thy wealth in alms, for the more the gardener prunes hisvine the more he adds to his crop of grapes."CHAPTER IIIOn the Preciousness of ContentmentIA mendicant from the west of Africa had taken his station amidst a groupof shopkeepers at Aleppo, and was saying: "O lords of plenty! had ye ajust sense of equity, and we of contentment, all manner of importunitywould cease in this world!" O contentment! do thou make me rich, forwithout thee there is no wealth. The treasure of patience was the choiceof Lucman. Whoever has no patience has no wisdom.IIThere dwelt in Egypt two youths of noble birth, one of whom appliedhimself to study knowledge, and the other to accumulate wealth. Inprocess of time that became the wisest man of his age, and this king ofEgypt. Then was the rich man casting an eye of scorn upon hisphilosophic brother, and saying, "I have reached a sovereignty, and youremain thus in a state of poverty." He replied: "O brother! I am all themore grateful for the bounty of a Most High God, whose name wasglorified, that I have found the heritage of the prophets--namely,wisdom; and you have got the estate of Pharaoh and Haman--that is, thekingdom of Egypt. I am an emmet, that mankind shall tread under foot;not a hornet, that they shall complain of my sting. How can Isufficiently express my grateful sense of this blessing, that I possessnot the means of injuring my fellow-creatures?"IIII heard of a dervish who was consuming in the flame of want, tackingpatch after patch upon his ragged garment, and solacing his mind withthis couplet:--"I can rest content with a dry crust of bread and acoarse woollen frock, for the burden of my own exertion bears lighterthan laying myself under obligation to another."--Somebody observed tohim, "Why do you sit quiet, while a certain gentleman of this city is sonobly disposed and universally benevolent, that he has girt up his loinsin the service of the religious independents, and seated himself by thedoor of their hearts? Were he apprised of your condition, he wouldesteem himself obliged, and be happy in the opportunity of relievingit." He said: "Be silent; for it is better to die of want than to exposeour necessities before another, as they have remarked:--'Patching atattered cloak, and the consequent treasure of content, are morecommendable than petitioning the great for every new garment.'" By mytroth, I swear it were equal to the torments of hell to enter intoparadise through the interest of a neighbor.IVOne of the Persian kings sent a skilful physician to attend MohammedMustafa, on whom be salutation. He remained some years in the territoryof the Arabs; but nobody went to try his skill, or asked him for anymedicine. One day he presented himself before the blessed prince ofprophets, and complained, saying, "The king had sent me to dispensemedicine to your companions; but, till this moment, nobody has been sogood as to enable me to practise any skill that this your servant maypossess." The blessed messenger of God was pleased to answer, saying,"It is a rule with this tribe never to eat till hard pressed by hunger,and to discontinue their repast while they have yet an appetite." Thephysician said, "This accounts for their health." Then he kissed theearth of respect and took his leave. The physician will then begin toinculcate temperance, or to extend the finger of indulgence, when fromsilence his patient might suffer by excess, or his life be endangered byabstinence:--of course, the skill of the physician is advice, and thepatient's regimen and diet yield the fruits of health!VA certain person would be making vows of abstinence and breaking them.At last a reverend gentleman observed to him, "So I understand that youmake a practice of eating to excess; and that any restraint on yourappetite, namely, this vow, is weaker than a hair, and thisvoraciousness, as you indulge it, would break an iron chain; but the daymust come when it will destroy you." A man was rearing the whelp of awolf; when full grown it tore its patron and master.VIIn the annals of Ardishir Babagan it is recorded that he asked anArabian physician, saying, "What quantity of food ought to be eatendaily?" He replied, "A hundred dirams' weight were sufficient." The kingsaid, "What strength can a man derive from so small a quantity?" Thephysician replied: "_So much can support you; but in whatever you exceedthat you must support it_.--Eating is for the purpose of living, andspeaking in praise of God; but thou believest that we live only to eat."VIITwo dervishes of Khorasan were fellow-companions on a journey. One wasso spare and moderate that he would break his fast only every othernight, and the other so robust and intemperate that he ate three meals aday. It happened that they were taken up at the gate of a city onsuspicion of being spies, and both together put into a place, theentrance of which was built up with mud. After a fortnight it wasdiscovered that they were innocent, when, on breaking open the door,they found the strong man dead, and the weak one alive and well. Theywere astonished at this circumstance. A wise man said, "The contrary ofthis had been strange, for this one was a voracious eater, and nothaving strength to support a want of food, perished; and that other wasabstemious, and being patient, according to his habitual practice,survived it.--When a person is habitually temperate, and a hardshipshall cross him, he will get over it with ease; but if he has pamperedhis body and lived in luxury, and shall get into straitenedcircumstances, he must perish."VIIIA certain philosopher admonished his son against eating to an excess,because repletion made a man sick. The boy answered, "O father, hungerwill kill. Have you not heard what the wits have remarked, To die of asurfeit were better than to bear with a craving appetite?" The fathersaid, "Study moderation, for the Most High God has told us in theKoran:--'_Eat ye and drink ye, but not to an excess_:'--eat not sovoraciously that the food shall be regorged from thy mouth, nor soabstemiously that from depletion life shall desert thee:--though food bethe means of preserving breath in the body. Yet, if taken to excess, itwill prove noxious. If conserve of roses be frequently indulged in itwill cause a surfeit, whereas a crust of bread, eaten after a longinterval, will relish like conserve of roses."XIIn a battle with the Tartars, a gallant young man was grievouslywounded. Somebody said to him, "A certain merchant has a stock of themummy antidote; if you would ask him, he might perhaps accommodate youwith a portion of it." They say that merchant was so notorious for hisstinginess, that--"If, in the place of his loaf of bread, the orb of thesun had been in his wallet, nobody would have seen daylight in the worldtill the day of judgment."The spirited youth replied: "Were I to ask him for this antidote, hemight give it, or he might not; and if he did it might cure me, or itmight not; at any rate, to ask such a man were itself a deadly poison!"Whatever thou wouldst ask of the mean, in obligation, might add to thebody, but would take from the soul.--And philosophers have observed,that were the water of immortality, for example, to be sold at theprice of the reputation, a wise man would not buy it, for an honorabledeath is preferable to a life of infamy.--Wert thou to eat colocynthfrom the hand of the kind-hearted, it would relish better than asweetmeat from that of the crabbed.XIIOne of the learned had a large family and small means. He stated hiscase to a great man, who entertained a favorable opinion of hischaracter. This one turned away from his solicitation, and viewed thisprostitution of begging as discreditable with a gentleman of education.If soured by misfortune, present not thyself before a dear friend, forthou may'st also imbitter his pleasure. When thou bringest forward adistress, do it with a cheerful and smiling face, for an openness ofcountenance can never retard business.--They have related that he rose alittle in the pension, but sunk much in the estimation of the great man.After some days, when he perceived this falling off in his affection, hesaid:--"_Miserable is that supply of food which thou obtainest in thehour of need; the pot is put to boil, but my reputation is bubbled intovapor_.--He added to my means of subsistence, but took from myreputation; absolute starving were better than the disgrace of begging."XIIIA dervish had a pressing call for money. Somebody told him a certainperson is inconceivably rich; were he made aware of your want, he wouldsomehow manage to accommodate it. He said, "I do not know him." Theother answered, "I will introduce you;" and having taken his hand, hebrought him to that person's dwelling. The dervish beheld a man with ahanging lip, and sitting in sullen discontent. He said nothing, andreturned home. His friend asked, "What have you done?" He replied, "Hisgift I gave in exchange for his look:--Lay not thy words before a manwith a sour face, otherwise thou may'st be ruffled by his ill-nature. Ifthou tellest the sorrows of thy heart let it be to him in whosecountenance thou may'st be assured of prompt consolation."       *       *       *       *       *XVThey asked Hatim Tayi: "Have you ever met, or heard of, a person of amore independent spirit than yourself?" He answered: "Yes, one day I hadmade a sacrifice of forty camels, and invited the chief of every Arabtribe to a feast. Then I repaired to the border of the desert, where Imet a wood-cutter, who had tied up his fagot to carry it into the city.I said, Why do you not go to the feast of Hatim, where a crowd haveassembled round his carpet? He replied:--'Whoever can eat the bread ofhis own industry will not lay himself under obligation to HatimTayi.'--And in him I met my superior in spirit and independence."XVIThe Prophet Moses, on whom be peace, saw a dervish who had buried hisbody, in his want of clothes to cover it, in the sand. He said: "OMoses, put up a prayer, that the Most High God would bestow asubsistence upon me, for I am perishing in distress." The blessed Mosesprayed accordingly, that God on high would succor him.Some days afterwards, as he was returning from a conference with God onMount Sinai, he met that dervish in the hands of justice, and a mobfollowing him. He asked: "What has befallen this man?" They answered:"He had drunk wine and got into a quarrel, and having killed somebody,they are now going to exact retaliation."--The God who set forth theseven climates of this world assigned to every creature its appropriatelot. Had that wretched cat been gifted with wings, she would not haveleft one sparrow's egg on the earth. It might happen that were a weakman to get the ability, he would rise and domineer over his weakbrethren.The blessed Moses acknowledged the wisdom of the Creator of theuniverse, and, confessing his own presumption, repeated this verse ofthe Koran:--"_Were God to spread abroad his stores of subsistence toservants, verily they would rebel all over the earth._" What happened, Ovain man! that thou didst precipitate thyself into destruction? Wouldthat the ant might not have the means of flying!--A mean person, whenhe has got rank and wealth, will bring a storm of blows upon his head.Was not this at last the adage of a philosopher, 'That ant is bestdisposed of that has no wings.'--The father is a man of much sweetnessof disposition, but the son is full of heat and passions:--That Being,God, who would not make thee rich, must have known thy good better thanthou couldst thyself know it.XVIII saw an Arab, who was standing amidst a circle of jewellers at Busrah,and saying: "On one occasion I had missed my way in the desert, andhaving no road-provision left, I had given myself up for lost, when allat once I found a bag of pearls. Never shall I forget that relish anddelight, so long as I mistook them for parched wheat; nor thatbitterness and disappointment, when I discovered that they were realpearls." In the mouth of the thirsty traveller, amidst parched desertsand moving sands, pearl, or mother-of-pearl, were equally distasteful.To a man without provision, and knocked up in the desert, a piece ofstone or of gold, in his scrip, is all one.XVIIIAn Arab, suffering under all the extremity of thirst in the desert, wassaying:--"_Would to God that yet, before I perish, I could but for oneday gratify my wish: that a stream of water might dash against my knees,and I could fill my leathern flask or stomach with it_."In like manner a traveller had got bewildered in the great desert, andhad neither provisions nor strength left, yet a few dirams remained withhim in his scrip. He kept wandering about, but could not find the path,and sunk under his fatigue. A party of travellers arrived where his bodylay; they saw the dirams spread before him, and these verses written inthe sand:--"Were he possessed of all the gold of Jafier (a famous goldrefiner), a man without food could not satisfy his appetite. To awretched mendicant, parched in the desert, a boiled turnip would relishbetter than an ingot of virgin silver."XIXI had never complained of the vicissitudes of fortune, nor murmured atthe ordinances of heaven, excepting on one occasion, that my feet werebare, and I had not wherewithal to shoe them. In this desponding state Ientered the metropolitan mosque at Cufah, and there I beheld a man thathad no feet. I offered up praise and thanksgiving for God's goodness tomyself, and submitted with patience to my want of shoes.--In the eye ofone satiated with meat a roast fowl is less esteemed at his table than asalad; but to him who is stinted of food a boiled turnip will relishlike a roast fowl.XXA king, attended by a select retinue, had, on a sporting excursionduring the winter, got at a distance from any of his hunting seats, andthe evening was closing fast, when they espied from afar a peasant'scottage. The king said: "Let us repair thither for the night, that wemay shelter ourselves from the inclemency of the weather." One of thecourtiers replied: "It would not become the dignity of the sovereign totake refuge in the cottage of a low peasant; we can pitch a tent hereand kindle a fire." The peasant saw what was passing; he came forwardwith what refreshments he had at hand, and, laying them before the king,kissed the earth of subserviency, and said: "The lofty dignity of theking would not be lowered by this condescension; but these gentlemen didnot choose that the condition of a peasant should be exalted." The kingwas pleased with this speech; and they passed the night at his cottage.In the morning he bestowed an honorary dress and handsome largess uponhim. I have heard that the peasant was resting his hand for some pacesupon the king's stirrup, and saying: "The state and pomp of thesovereign suffered no degradation by his condescension in becoming aguest at the cottage of a peasant; but the corner of the peasant's caprose to a level with the sun when the shadow of such a monarch as thouart fell upon his head."XXIThey tell a story of an importunate mendicant who had amassed muchriches. A certain king said: "It seems that you possess immense wealth,and I have a business of some consequence in hand. If you will assist mewith a little of it, by way of a loan, when the public revenue isrealized I will repay it and thank you to the bargain." He replied: "Osire, it would ill become the sublime majesty of the sovereign of theuniverse to soil the hand of lofty enterprise with the property of sucha mendicant as I am, which I have scraped together grain by grain." Hesaid: "There is no occasion to vex yourself, for I mean it for theTartars, as impurities are suiting for the impure:--_They said, 'Thecompost of a dunghill is unclean.' We replied, 'That with it we willfill up the chinks of a necessary_.'--If the water of a Christian's wellis defiled, and we wash a Jew's corpse in it, there is no sin." I haveheard that he disobeyed the royal command, questioned its justice, andresisted it with insolence. The king ordered that the exchequerstipulations should be put in force with rigidness and violence. When abusiness cannot be settled with fair words, we must of necessity makeuse of foul. When a man will not contribute of his own free will, ifanother enforces him he meets his desert.XXIII knew a merchant who had a hundred and fifty camels of burden and fortybondsmen and servants in his train. One night he entertained me at hislodgings in the island of Keish, in the Persian Gulf, and continued forthe whole night talking idly, and saying: "Such a store of goods I havein Turkestan, and such an assortment of merchandise in Hindustan; thisis the mortgage-deed of a certain estate, and this the security-bond ofa certain individual's concern." Then he would say: "I have a mind tovisit Alexandria, the air of which is salubrious; but that cannot be,for the Mediterranean Sea is boisterous. O Sa'di! I have one morejourney in view, and, that once accomplished, I will pass my remaininglife in retirement and leave off trade." I asked: "What journey isthat?" He replied: "I will carry the sulphur of Persia to Chin, where,I have heard, it will fetch a high price; thence I will take Chinaporcelain to Greece; the brocade of Greece or Venice I will carry toIndia; and Indian steel I will bring to Aleppo; the glassware of AleppoI will take to Yamin; and with the bardimani, or striped stuffs, ofYamin I will return to Persia. After that I will give up foreigncommerce and settle myself in a warehouse." He went on in thismelancholy strain till he was quite exhausted with speaking. He said: "OSa'di! do you too relate what you have seen and heard." Ireplied:--"Hast thou not heard that in the desert of Ghor as the body ofa chief merchant fell exhausted from his camel, he said, 'Eithercontentment or the dust of the grave will fill the stingy eye of theworldly-minded.'"       *       *       *       *       *XXIVA weak fisherman got a strong fish into his net, but not having thepower of mastering it, the fish got the better of him, and, dragging thenet from his hand, escaped:--A bondsman went that he might take waterfrom the brook; the brook came to rise and carried off the bondsman. Onmost occasions the net would bring out the fish; on this occasion thefish escaped, and took away the net. The other fishermen expressed theirvexation, and reproached him, saying, "Such a fish came into your net,and you were not able to master it." He replied: "Alas! my brethren,what could be done? It was not my day of fortune, and the fish had inthis way another day left it. And they have said: 'Unless it be his lot,the fisherman cannot catch a fish in the Tigris; and, except it be itsfate, the fish will not die on the dry shore.'"XXVA person without hands or feet killed a milleped. A good and holy manpassed by him at the time, and said: "Glory be to God! notwithstandingthe thousand feet he had when his destiny overtook him, he was unable toescape from one destitute of hand or foot."--When the life-plunderingfoe comes up behind, fate arrests the speed of the swift-going warrior.At the moment when the enemy might approach step by step it were uselessto bend the kayani, or Parthian bow.XXVII met a fat blockhead decked in rich apparel, and mounted on an Arabhorse, with a turban of fine Egyptian linen on his head. A person said:"O Sa'di, how comes it that you see these garments of the learned onthis ignorant beast?" I replied: "It is a vile epistle which has beenwritten in golden letters:--'_Verily this ass, with the resemblance of aman, has the carcase of a calf, and the voice or bleating of acalf_.'--Thou canst not say that this brute appears like a man, unlessin his garments, turban, and outward form. Examine into all the ways andmeans of his existence, and thou shalt find nothing lawful but theshedding of his blood:--though a man of noble birth be reduced topoverty, imagine not that his lofty dignity can be lowered; and thoughhe may secure his silver threshold with a hasp of gold, conclude notthat a Jew can be thereby ennobled."XXVIIA thief said to a mendicant: "Are you not ashamed when you hold forthyour hand to every mean fellow for a barleycorn of silver?" He replied:"It is better to hold forth the hand for one grain of silver than tohave it cut off for one and a half dang."       *       *       *       *       *XXIXI saw a dervish who had withdrawn into a cave, shut the door ofcommunication between the world and himself, and with his lofty andindependent eye viewed emperors and kings without awe orreverence:--Whoever opens to himself the door of mendicity, mustcontinue a beggar till the day of his death. Put covetousness aside, andbe independent as a prince; the neck of contentment can raise its headerect.One of the sovereigns of those parts sent a message to him, stating: "Sofar I can rely on the generous disposition of his reverence, that hewill one day favor me by partaking of my bread and salt, by becoming myguest." The shaikh, or holy man, consented; for the acceptance of suchan invitation accorded with the sunnat, or law and tradition of theprophet. Next day the king went to apologize for the trouble he hadcaused him. The abid rose from his place, took the king in his arms,showed him much kindness, and was full of his compliments. After he wasgone, one of the shaikh's companions asked him, saying: "Was not suchcondescending kindness as you this day showed the king contrary to whatis usual; what does this mean?" He answered: "Have you not heard whatthey have said:--'It is proper to stand up and administer to him whomthou hast seated on thy carpet, or made thy guest.'"He could so manage that, during his whole life, his ear should notindulge in the music of the tabor, cymbal, and pipe. He could restrainhis eyes from enjoying the garden, and gratify his sense of smellwithout the rose or narcissus. Though he had not a pillow stuffed withdown, he could compose himself to rest with a stone under his head;though he had no heart-solacer as the partner of his bed, he could hughimself to sleep with his arms across his breast. If he could not ridean ambling nag, he was content to take his walk on foot; only thisgrumbling and vile belly he could not keep under, without stuffing itwith food.CHAPTER IVOn the Benefit of Being SilentII spoke to one of my friends, saying: "A prudent restraint on my wordsis on that account advisable, because in conversation there on mostoccasions occur good and bad; and the eyes of rivals only note what isbad." He replied: "O brother! that is our best rival who does not, orwill not, see our good!--_The malignant brotherhood pass not by thevirtuous man without imputing to him what is infamous_:--To the eye ofenmity, virtue appears the ugliest blemish; it is a rose, O Sa'di! whichto the eyes of our rivals seems a thorn. The world-illuminatingbrilliancy of the fountain of the sun, in like manner, appears dim tothe eye of the purblind mole."IIA merchant happened to lose a thousand dinars. He said to his son: "Itwill be prudent not to mention this loss to anybody." The son answered:"O father, it is your orders, and I shall not mention it; butcommunicate the benefit so far, as what the policy may be in keeping ita secret." He said: "That I may not suffer two evils: one, the loss ofmy money; another, the reproach of my neighbor;--Impart not thygrievances to rivals, for they are glad at heart, while praying, _Godpreserve us_; or _there is neither strength nor power, unless it be fromGod!_"IIIA sensible youth made vast progress in the arts and sciences, and was ofa docile disposition; but however much he frequented the societies ofthe learned, they never could get him to utter a word. On one occasionhis father said: "O my son, why do not you also say what you know onthis subject?" He replied: "I am afraid lest they question me upon whatI know not, and put me to shame:--Hast thou not heard of a Sufi who washammering some nails into the sole of his sandal. An officer of cavalrytook him by the sleeve, saying, 'Come along, and shoe my horse.'--Solong as thou art silent and quiet, nobody will meddle with thy business;but once thou divulgest it, be ready with thy proofs."IVA man, respectable for his learning, got into a discussion with anatheist; but, failing to convince him, he threw down his shield andfled. A person asked him, "With all your wisdom and address, learningand science, how came you not to controvert an infidel?" He replied: "Mylearning is the Koran, and the traditions and sayings of our holyfathers; but he puts no faith in the articles of our belief, and whatgood could it do to listen to his blasphemy?" To him whom thou canst notconvince by revelation or tradition, the best answer is that thou shaltnot answer him.       *       *       *       *       *VIThey have esteemed Sahban Wabil as unrivalled in eloquence, insomuchthat he could speak for a year before an assembly, and would not use thesame word twice; or should he chance to repeat it, he would give it adifferent signification; and this is one of the special accomplishmentsof a courtier:--Though a speech be captivating and sweet, worthy ofbelief, and meriting applause, yet what thou hast once delivered thoumust not repeat, for if they eat a sweetmeat once they find that enough.VIII overheard a sage, who was remarking: "Never has anybody acknowledgedhis own ignorance, excepting that person who, while another may betalking, and has not finished what he has to say, will beginspeaking:--A speech, O wiseacre! has a beginning and an end; bring notone speech into the middle of another. A man of judgment, discretion,and prudence, delivers not his speech till he find an interval ofsilence."VIIISome of the courtiers of Sultan Mahmud asked Husan Maimandi, saying:"What did the king whisper to you to-day on a certain state affair?" Hesaid: "You are also acquainted with it." They replied: "You are theprime minister; what the king tells you, he does not think proper tocommunicate to such as we are." He replied: "He communicates with me inthe confidence that I will not divulge to anybody; then why do you askme?" A man of sense blabs not, whatever he may come to know; he shouldnot make his own head the forfeit of the king's secret.IXI was hesitating about the purchase of a dwelling-house. A Jew said: "Iam an old housekeeper in this street: ask the character of this housefrom me and buy it, for it has no fault." I replied: "True! only thatyou are its neighbor:--Any such house as has thee for its neighbor couldscarce be worth ten dirams of silver; yet it should behoove us to hopethat after thy death it may fetch a thousand."XA certain poet presented himself before the chief of a gang of robbers,and recited a casidah, or elegy, in his praise. He ordered that theyshould strip off his clothes, and thrust him from the village. The nakedwretch was going away shivering in the cold, and the village dogs werebarking at his heels. He stooped to pick up a stone, in order to shy atthe dogs, but found the earth frost-bound, and was disappointed. Heexclaimed: "What rogues these villagers are, for they let loose theirdogs, and tie up their stones!" The chief robber saw and overheard himfrom a window. He smiled at his wit, and, calling him near said: "Olearned sir! ask me for a boon." He replied, "I ask for my own garments,if you will vouchsafe to give them:--_I shall have enough of boons inyour suffering me to depart_.--Mankind expects charity from others; Iexpect no charity from thee, only do me no injury." The chief robberfelt compassion for him. He ordered his clothes to be restored, andadded to them a robe of fur and sum of money.       *       *       *       *       *XIIA preacher of a harsh tone of voice fancied himself a fine-spoken man,and would hold forth at the mosque to a very idle purpose. You might saythat the croaking of the raven of the desert was the burden of hischant, and this text of the Koran expressive of his manner:--_The mostabominable of noises is the braying of an ass:--"Whenever this ass of apreacher sets up a braying, his voice will make the city of Istakhar, orPersepolis, shake to its base_."In reverence of his rank his townsmen indulged this defect, and wouldnot distress him by remarking on it, till another preacher of thoseparts, actuated by a private pique, came on one occasion to tantalizehim, and said, "I have seen you in a dream; may it prove fortunate!" Heasked: "What have you seen?" He replied: "So it seemed in my vision thatyour voice had become harmonious, and mankind were charmed with yourmelodious cadences." For a while the preacher bowed his head in thought,then raised it, and said: "What a fortunate vision is it that you had,that has made me sensible of my weakness! I am now aware that I have anunpleasant voice, and that the people are distressed at my delivery. Ihave vowed that I will henceforth preach only in a soft tone of voice."I am distressed with the society of friends who extol my vices intovirtues, my blemishes they view as excellences and perfections, mythorns they regard as roses and jasmines. Where is that rude and boldrival who will expose all my deformities?XIIIAt a mosque in the city of Sanjar, the capital of Khorasan, a person wasvolunteering to chant forth the call to prayers with so discordant anote as to drive all that heard him away in disgust. The intendant ofthat mosque was a just and well-disposed gentleman, who was averse togiving offence to anybody. He said: "O generous youth, there belong tothis mosque some mowuzzins, or criers, of long standing, to each ofwhom I allow a monthly stipend of five dinars; now I will give you tento go elsewhere." To this he agreed, and took himself off. After a whilehe came to the nobleman, and said: "O my lord! you did me an injury whenfor ten dinars you prevailed upon me to quit this station, for where Iwent they offered me twenty to remove to another place, but I would notconsent." The nobleman smiled and replied: "Take heed, and do not acceptthem, for they may be content to give you fifty!--No person can with amattock scrape off the clay from the face of a hard rock in so grating amanner as thy harsh voice is harrowing up my soul."XIVA person with a harsh voice was reciting the Koran in a loud tone. Agood and holy man went up to him, and asked: "What is your monthlystipend?" He answered, "Nothing." "Then," added he, "why give yourselfso much trouble?" He said: "I am reading for the sake of God." The goodand holy man replied: "For God's sake do not read:--for if thou chantestthe Koran after this manner, thou must cast a shade over the glory ofIslamism or Mussulman orthodoxy."CHAPTER VOn Love and YouthIThey asked Husan Maimandi: "How comes it that Sultan Mahmud, who has somany handsome bondswomen, each of whom is the wonder of the world andmost select of the age, entertains not such fondness and affection forany of them as he does for Ayaz, who can boast of no superiority ofcharms?" He replied: "Whatever makes an impression on the heart seemslovely in the eye. That person of whom the sultan makes choice must bealtogether good, though a compendium of vice; but where he is estrangedfrom the favor of the king none of the household will think of courtinghim." Were a person to view it with a fastidious eye, the form of aJoseph might seem a deformity; but let him look with desire on a demon,and he will appear like an angel and cherub.       *       *       *       *       *IIII saw a parsa, or holy man, so enamoured of a lovely person that he hadneither fortitude to bear with, nor resolution to declare, his passion:and, however much he was the object of remark and censure, he would notforego this infatuation, and was saying:--"I quit not my hold on theskirt of thy garment, though thou may'st verily smite me with a sharpsword. Besides thee I have neither asylum nor defence; if I am to flee,I must take refuge with thee."On one occasion I reproached him, and said: "What is become of yourprecious reason, that a vile passion should thus master you?" He made ashort pause, and replied:--"Wherever the king of love came, he left noroom for the strong arm of chastity. How can that wretch live undefiledwho has fallen in a quagmire up to the neck?"IVA certain person had lost his heart and abandoned himself to despair.The object of his desire was not such a dainty that he could gratify hispalate with it, or a bird that he could lure it into his net, but afrightful precipice and overwhelming whirlpool:--When thy gold attractsnot the charmer's eye, dust or gold is of equal value with thee.His friends admonished him, saying: "Put aside this vain fancy, formultitudes are in the durance and chains of this same passion which youare cherishing." He sighed aloud, and replied: "Say to my friends, Donot admonish me, for my eye is fixed on the wish of her. With strengthof wrist and power of shoulders warriors overwhelm their antagonists andcharmers their lovers." Nor can it be consistent with the condition oflove that any thought of life should divert the heart from affection forits mistress:--Thou, who art the slave of thine own precious self,playest false in the affairs of love. If thou canst not make good apassage to thy mistress, it is the duty of a lover to perish in theattempt.--I persist when policy is no longer left me, though the enemymay cover me all over with the wounds of swords and arrows. If I canreach her I will seize her sleeve, or at all events proceed and die ather threshold.His kindred, whose business it was to watch over his concerns, and topity his misfortunes, gave him advice, and put upon him restraints, butall to no good purpose:--The physician is, alas! prescribingbitter-aloes, and his depraved appetite is craving sweetmeats!--Heardestthou what a charmer was saying in a whisper to one who had lost hisheart to her: "So long as thou maintainest thine own dignity, of whatvalue can my dignity appear in thine eye?"They informed the princess who was the object of his infatuation,saying: "A youth of an amiable disposition and sweet flow of tongue isfrequent in his attendance at the top of this plain; and we hear himdelivering brilliant speeches and wonderful sallies of wit; it wouldseem that he has a mystery in his head and a flame in his heart, for heappears to be distractedly in love." The princess was aware that she hadbecome the object of his attachment, and that this whirlwind of calamitywas raised by himself, and spurred her horse toward him. Now that theyouth saw that it was the princess' intention to approach him, he wept,and said:--"That personage who inflicted upon me a mortal wound againpresented herself before me; perhaps she took compassion upon her ownvictim." However, kindly she spoke, and asked, saying: "Who are you, andwhence come you? what is your name, and what your calling?" the youthwas so entirely overwhelmed in the ocean of love and passion that heabsolutely could not utter a word:--"Couldst thou in fact repeat theseven Saba, or whole Koran by heart, if distracted with love, thouwouldst forget the alphabet":--the princess continued: "Why do you notanswer me? for I too am one of the sect of dervishes, nay, I am theirmost devoted slave." On the strength of this sympathizing encouragementof his beloved, the youth raised his head amidst the buffeting waves oftempestuous passion, and answered:--"It is strange that with theepresent I should remain in existence; that after thou camest to talk, Ishould have speech left me."--This he said, and, uttering a loud groan,surrendered his soul up to God:--No wonder if he died by the door of hisbeloved's tent; the wonder was, if alive, how he could have brought hislife back in safety.VA boy at school possessed much loveliness of person and sweetness ofconversation; and the master, from the frailty of human nature, wasenamoured of his blooming skin. Like his other scholars, he would notadmonish and correct him, but when he found him in a corner he wouldwhisper in his ear:--"I am not, O celestial creature! so occupied withthee, that I am harboring in my mind a thought of myself. Were I toperceive an arrow coming right into it, I could not shut my eye fromcontemplating thee."On one occasion the boy said: "In like manner, as you inspect my duties,also animadvert on my tendency to vice, in order that if you discern anyimmorality in my behavior, which has met my own approbation, you canwarn me against it, that I may correct it." He replied: "O my child!propose this task to somebody else; for the light in which I view youreflects nothing but virtue." That malignant eye, let it be plucked outin whose sight his virtue can seem vice. Hadst thou but one perfectionand seventy faults, the lover could discern only that one perfection.       *       *       *       *       *VIIA person who had not seen his friend for a length of time, said to him:"Where were you? for I have been very solicitous about you." He replied,"It is better to be sought after than loathed." Thou hast come late, Ointoxicating idol! I shall not in a hurry quit my hold on thyskirt:--that mistress whom they see but seldom is at last more desiredthan she is whom they are cloyed with seeing.The charmer that can bring companions along with her has come toquarrel; for she cannot be void of jealousy and discontent:--_Wheneverthou contest to visit me attended with comrades or rivals, though thoucomest in peace yet thy object is hostile_:--for one single moment thatmy mistress associated with a rival, it went well-nigh to slay me withjealousy. Smiling, she replied: "O Sa'di! I am the torch of theassembly; what is it to me if the moth consume itself?"VIIIIn former times, I recollect, a friend and I were associating togetherlike two kernels within one almond shell. I happened unexpectedly to goon a journey. After some time, when I was returned, he began to chideme, saying: "During this long interval you never sent me a messenger." Ireplied: "It vexed me to think that the eyes of a courier should beenlightened by your countenance, whilst I was debarred thathappiness:--Tell my old charmer not to impose a vow upon me with hertongue; for I would not repent, were she to attempt it with a sword.Envy stings me to the quick, lest another should be satiated withbeholding thee, till I recollect myself, and say: Nobody can have asatiety of that!"IXI saw a learned gentleman the captive of attachment for a certainperson, and the victim of his reproach; and he would suffer muchviolence, and bear it with great patience. On one occasion I said, byway of admonition: "I know that in your attachment for this person youhave no bad object, and that this friendship rests not on any criminaldesign; yet, under this interpretation, it accords not with the dignityof the learned to expose yourself to calumny, and put up with therudeness of the rabble." He replied: "O my friend, withdraw the hand ofreproach from the skirt of my fatality, for I have frequently reflectedon this advice which you offer me, and find it easier to suffercontumely on his account than to forego his company; and philosophershave said: 'It is less arduous to persist in the labor of courting thanto restrain the eye from contemplating a beloved object':--Whoeverdevotes his heart to a soul deluder puts his beard or reputation intothe hands of another. That person, without whom thou canst not exist, ifhe do thee a violence, thou must bear with it. The antelope, that is ledby a string, cannot bound from this side to that. One day I asked acompact of my mistress; how often have I since that day craved herforgiveness! A lover exacts not terms of his charmer; I relinquished myheart to whatever she desired me, whether to call me up to her withkindness, or drive me from her with harshness she knows best, or it isher pleasure."XIn my early youth such an event (as you know) will come to pass. I helda mystery and intercourse with a young person, because he had a pipe ofexquisite melody, and a form silver bright as the full moon:--"He issipping the fountain of immortality, who may taste the down of hischeek; and he is eating a sweetmeat, who can fancy the sugar of hislips."It happened that something in his behavior having displeased me, Iwithdrew the skirt of communication, and removed the seal of myaffection from him, and said: "Go, and take what course best suits thee;thou regardest not my counsel, follow thine own." I overheard him as hewas going, and saying:--"If the bat does not relish the company of thesun, the all-current brilliancy of that luminary can suffer nodiminution." He so expressed himself and departed, and his vagabondcondition much distressed me:--_the opportunity of enjoyment was lost,and a man is insensible to the relish of prosperity till he_ _hastasted adversity_:--return and slay me, for to die before thy face werefar more pleasant than to survive in thy absence.But, thanksgiving and praise to the Almighty, he did not return tillafter some interval, when that melodious pipe of David was cracked, andthat handsome form of Joseph in its wane; when that apple his chin wasovergrown with hair, like a quince, and the all-current lustre of hischarms tarnished. He expected me to fold him in my arms; but I tookmyself aside and said: "When the down of loveliness flourished on thycheek, thou drovest the lord of thy attractions from thy sight; now thouhast come to court his peace when thy face is thick set with fathahs andzammahs, or the bristles of a beard:--The verdant foliage of thy springis turned yellow; place not thy kettle on my grate, for its fire iscooled. How long wilt thou display this pomp and vanity; hopest thou toregain thy former dominion? Make thy court to such as desire thee, sportthy airs on such as will hire thee:--The verdure of the garden, theyhave told us, is charming; that person (Sa'di) knows it who is relatingthat story; or, in other words, that the fresh-shooting down on theircharmers' cheeks is what the hearts of their admirers chieflycovet:--Thy garden is like a bed of chives: the more thou croppest it,the more it will shoot:--Last year thou didst depart smooth as anantelope, to-day thou art returned bearded like a pard. Sa'di admiresthe fresh-shooting down, not when each hair is stiff as apacking-needle:--Whether thou hast patience with thy beard, or weed itfrom thy face, this happy season of youth must come to a conclusion. HadI the same command of life as thou hast of beard, it should not escapeme till doomsday." I asked him and said: "What has become of the beautyof thy countenance, that a beard has sprung up round the orb of themoon?" He answered: "I know not what has befallen my face, unless it hasput on black to mourn its departed charms."       *       *       *       *       *XIIThey shut up a parrot in the same cage with a crow. The parrot wasaffronted at his ugly look, and said: "What an odious visage is this, ahideous figure; what an accursed appearance, and ungraciousdemeanor!--_Would to God, O raven of the desert! we were wide apartas the east is from the west_:--The serenity of his peaceful day wouldchange into the gloom of night, who on issuing forth in the morningmight cross thy aspect. An ill-conditioned wretch like thyself should bethy companion; but where could we find such another in the world?"But what is more strange, the crow was also out of all patience, andvexed to the soul at the society of the parrot. Bewailing hismisfortune, he was railing at the revolutions of the skies; and,wringing the hands of chagrin, was lamenting his condition, and saying:"What an unpropitious fate is this; what ill-luck, and untoward fortune!Could they any way suit the dignity of me, who would in my day strutwith my fellow-crows along the wall of a garden:--It were durancesufficient for a good and holy man that he should be made the companionof the wicked:--What sin have I committed that my stars in retributionof it have linked me in the chain of companionship, and immured me inthe dungeon of calamity, with a conceited blockhead, andgood-for-nothing babbler:--Nobody will approach the foot of a wall onwhich they have painted thy portrait; wert thou to get a residence inparadise, others would go in preference to hell."I have introduced this parable to show that however much learned mendespise the ignorant, these are a hundredfold more scornful of thelearned:--A zahid, or holy man, fell in company with some wanderingminstrels. One of them, a charmer of Balkh, said to him: "If thou artdispleased with us, do not look sour, for thou art already sufficientlyoffensive.--An assemblage is formed of roses and tulips, and thou artstuck up amidst them like a withered stalk; like an opposing storm, anda chilling winter blast; like a ball of snow, or lump of ice."XIIII had an associate, who was for years the companion of my travels,partook of the same bread and salt, and enjoyed the many rights of aconfirmed friendship. At last, on some trifling advantage, he gave mecause of umbrage, and our intimacy ceased. And notwithstanding all this,there was a hankering of good-will on both sides; in consequence ofwhich I heard that he was one day reciting in a certain assembly thesetwo couplets of my writings:--"When my idol, or mistress, isapproaching me with her tantalizing smiles, she is sprinkling more saltupon my smarting sores. How fortunate were the tips of her ringlets tocome into my hand, like the sleeve of the generous in the hands ofdervishes." This society of his friends bore testimony, and gaveapplause, not to the beauty of this sentiment, but to the liberality ofhis own disposition in quoting it; while he had himself been extravagantin his encomiums, regretted the demise of our former attachment, andconfessed how much he was to blame. I was made aware that he too wasdesirous of a reconciliation; and, having sent him these couplets, mademy peace:--"Was there not a treaty of good faith between us, and didstnot thou commence hostilities, and violate the compact? I relinquishedall manner of society, and plighted my heart to thee; for I did notsuspect that thou wouldst have so readily changed. If it still be thywish to renew our peace, return, and be more dear to me than ever."XIVA man had a beautiful wife, who died; but the mother, a decrepit olddotard, remained a fixture in his house, because of the dowry. He wasteased to death by her company; but, from the circumstance of the dower,he had no remedy. In the meantime some of his friends having come tocomfort him, one of them asked: "How is it with you, since the loss ofthat dear friend?" He answered: "The absence of my wife is not sointolerable as the presence of her mother:--They plucked the rose, andleft me the thorn; they plundered the treasure, and let the snakeremain. To have our eye pierced with a spear were more tolerable than tosee the face of an enemy. It were better to break with a thousandfriends than to put up with one rival."XVIn my youth I recollect I was passing through a street, and caught aglimpse of a moon-like charmer during the dog-days, when their heat wasdrying up the moisture of the mouth, and the samurn, or desert hot-wind,melting the marrow of the bones. From the weakness of human nature I wasunable to withstand the darting rays of a noon-tide sun, and tookrefuge under the shadow of a wall, hopeful that somebody would relieveme from the oppressive heat of summer, and quench the fire of my thirstwith a draught of water. All at once I beheld a luminary in the shadowedportico of a mansion, so splendid an object that the tongue of eloquencefalls short in summing up its loveliness; such as the day dawning upon adark night, or the fountain of immortality issuing from chaos. She heldin her hand a goblet of snow-cooled water, into which she dropped somesugar, and tempered it with spirit of wine; but I know not whether shescented it with attar, or sprinkled it with a few blossoms from her ownrosy cheek. In short, I received the beverage from her idol-fair hand;and, having drunk it off, found myself restored to a new life. "_Such isnot my parching thirst that it is to be quenched with the limpid elementof water, were I to swallow it in oceans_:--Joy to that happy aspectwhose eye can every morning contemplate such a countenance as thine. Aperson intoxicated with wine lies giddy and awake half the night; but ifintoxicated with the cup-bearer (God), the day of judgment must be hisdawn or morning."XVIIn the year that Sultan Mohammed Khowarazm-Shah had for some politicalreason chosen to make peace with the king of Khota, I entered themetropolitan mosque at Kashghar, and met a youth incomparably lovely,and exquisitely handsome; such as they have mentioned in resemblance ofhim:--"Thy master instructed thee in every bold and captivating grace;he taught thee coquetry and confidence, tyranny and violence." I haveseen no mortal with such a form and temper, stateliness and manner;perhaps he learned these fascinating ways from an angel.He held the introduction of the Zamakhshari Arabic grammar in his hand,and was repeating:--"Zaraba Zaidun Amranwa--Zaid beat Amru and is theassailant of Amru." I said: "O my son! the Khowarazm and Khatayisovereigns have made peace, and does war thus subsist between Zaid andAmru?" He smiled, and asked me the place of my nativity. I answered:"The territory of Shiraz." He said: "Do you recollect any of Sa'di'scompositions?" I replied: "_I am enamoured with the reader of thesyntax, who, taking offence, assails me in like manner as Zaid doesAmru. And Zaid, when read Zaidin, cannot raise his head; and how canstthou give a zammah to a word accented with a kasrah_?"He reflected a little within himself, and said: "In these parts we havemuch of Sa'di's compositions in the Persian language; if you will speakin that dialect we shall more readily comprehend you, for _you shouldaddress mankind according to their capacities_."I replied: "Whilst thy passion was that of studying grammar, all traceof reason was erased from our hearts. Yes! the lover's heart is fallen aprey to thy snare: we are occupied about thee, and thou art taken upwith Amru and Zaid."On the morrow, which had been fixed on as the period of our stay, someof my fellow-travellers had perhaps told him such a one is Sa'di; for Isaw that he came running up, and expressed his affection and regret,saying: "Why did you not during all this time tell us that a certainperson is Sa'di, that I might have shown my gratitude by offering myservice to your reverence." I answered: "In thy presence I cannot evensay that I am I!"--He said: "How good it were if you would tarry herefor a few days, that we might devote ourselves to your service." Ireplied: "That cannot be, as this adventure will explain to you:--In thehilly region I saw a great and holy man, who was content in livingretired from the world in a cavern. I said: 'Why dost thou not come intothe city, that thy heart might be relieved from a load of servitude?' Hereplied: 'In it there dwell some wonderful and angel-faced charmers, andwhere the path is miry, elephants may find it slippery.'--Havingdelivered this speech, we kissed each other's head and face, and tookour leaves:--What profits it to kiss our mistress's cheek, and with thesame breath to bid her adieu. Thou mightest say that the apple had takenleave of its friends by having this cheek red and that cheekyellow:--_Were I not to die of grief on that day I say farewell, thouwouldst charge me with being insincere in my attachments_."XVIIA ragged dervish accompanied us along with the caravan for Hijaz, and acertain Arab prince presented him with a hundred dinars for the supportof his family. Suddenly a gang of Khafachah robbers attacked thecaravan, and completely stripped it. The merchants set up a weeping andwailing, and made much useless lamentation and complaint:--"Whether thousupplicatest them, or whether thou complainest, the robbers will notreturn thee their plunder":--all but that ragged wretch, who stoodcollected within himself, and unmoved by this adventure. I said:"Perhaps they did not plunder you of that money?" He replied: "Yes, theytook it; but I was not so fond of my pet as to break my heart at partingwith it. We should not fix our heart so on any thing or being as to findany difficulty in removing it."I said: "What you have remarked corresponds precisely with what oncebefell myself; for in my juvenile days I took a liking to a young man,and so sincere was my attachment that the Cabah, or fane, of my eye washis perfect beauty, and the profit of this life's traffic hismuch-coveted society:--Perhaps the angels might in paradise, otherwiseno living form can on this earth display such a loveliness of person. Byfriendship I swear that after his demise all loving intercourse isforbidden; for no human emanation can stand a comparison with him."All at once the foot of his existence stumbled at the grave ofannihilation; and the sigh of separation burst from the dwelling of hisfamily. For many days I sat a fixture at his tomb, and, of the manydirges I composed upon his demise, this is one:--'On that day, when thyfoot was pierced with the thorn of death, would to God the hand of fatehad cloven my head with the sword of destruction, that my eyes might notthis day have witnessed the world without thee. Such am I, seated at thehead of thy dust, as the ashes are seated on my own:--whoever could nottake his rest and sleep till they first had spread a bed of roses andnarcissuses for him: the whirlwind of the sky has scattered the roses ofhis cheek, and brambles and thorns are shooting from his grave.'"After my separation from him I came to a steady and firmdetermination, that during my remaining life I would fold up the carpetof enjoyment, and never re-enter the gay circle of society:--Were it notfor the dread of its waves, much would be the profits of a voyage atsea; were it not for the vexation of the thorn, charming might be thesociety of the rose. Yesterday I was walking stately as a peacock in thegarden of enjoyment; to-day I am writhing like a snake from the absenceof my mistress."XVIII.To a certain king of Arabia they were relating the story of Laila andMujnun, and his insane state, saying: "Notwithstanding his knowledge andwisdom, he has turned his face towards the desert, and abandoned himselfto distraction." The king ordered that they bring him into his presence;and he reproved him, and spoke, saying: "What have you seen unworthy inthe noble nature of man that you should assume the manners of a brute,and forsake the enjoyment of human society?"Mujnun wept and answered:--"_Many of my friends reproach me for my loveof her, namely Laila. Alas! that they could one day see her, that myexcuse might be manifest for me!_--Would to God that such as blame mecould behold thy face, O thou ravisher of hearts! that at the sight ofthee they might, from inadvertency, cut their own fingers instead of theorange in their hands:--Then might the truth of the reality beartestimony against the semblance of fiction, _what manner of person thatwas for whose sake you were upbraiding me_."The king resolved within himself, on viewing in person the charms ofLaila, that he might be able to judge what her form could be which hadcaused all this misery, and ordered her to be produced in his presence.Having searched through the Arab tribes, they discovered and presentedher before the king in the courtyard of his seraglio. He viewed herfigure, and beheld a person of a tawny complexion and feeble frame ofbody. She appeared to him in a contemptible light, inasmuch as thelowest menial in his harem, or seraglio, surpassed her in beauty andexcelled her in elegance. Mujnun, in his sagacity, penetrated what waspassing in the royal mind, and said: "It would behoove you, O king, tocontemplate the charms of Laila through the wicket of a Mujnun's eye,in order that the miracle of such a spectacle might be illustrated toyou. Thou canst have no fellow-feeling for my disorder; a companion tosuit me must have the self-same malady, that I may sit by him thelivelong day repeating my tale; for by rubbing two pieces of dryfire-wood one upon another they will burn all the brighter:--_had thatgrove of verdant reeds heard the murmurings of love which in detail ofmy mistress's story have passed through my ear, it would somehow havesympathised in my pain. Tell it, O my friends, to such as are ignorantof love; would ye could be aware of what wrings me to the soul_:--theanguish of a wound is not known to the hale and sound; we must detailour aches only to a fellow-sufferer. It were idle to talk of a hornet tohim who has never during his life smarted from its sting. Till thycondition may in some sort resemble mine, my state will seem to thee anidle fable. Compare not my pain with that of another man; he holds saltin his hand, but I hold it on a wounded limb."       *       *       *       *       *XXThere was a handsome and well-disposed young man, who was embarked in avessel with a lovely damsel. I have read that, sailing on the mightydeep, they fell together into a whirlpool. When the pilot came to offerhim assistance, saying: "God forbid that he should perish in thatdistress," he was answering from the midst of that overwhelming vortex:"Leave me, and take the hand of my beloved!" The whole world admired himfor this speech which, as he was expiring, he was heard to make. Learnnot the tale of love from that faithless wretch who can neglect hisbeloved when exposed to danger. In this manner ended the lives of thoselovers. Listen to what has happened, that you may understand; for Sa'diknows the ways and forms of courtship as well as the Tazi, or modernArabic, is understood at Bagdad. Devote your whole heart to theheart-consoler you have chosen (namely, God), and let your eyes be shutto the whole world beside. Were Laila and Mujnun to return into life,they might read the history of love in this chapter.CHAPTER VIOf Imbecility and Old AgeIIn the metropolitan mosque at Damascus I was engaged in a disputationwith some learned men, when a youth suddenly entered the door, and said:"Does any of you understand the Persian language?" They directed him tome, and I answered: "It is true." He continued: "An old man of a hundredand fifty years of age is in the agonies of death, and is utteringsomething in the Persian language, which we do not understand. If youwill have the goodness to go to him you may get rewarded; for hepossibly may be dictating his will." When I sat down by his bedside Iheard him reciting:--"I said, I will enjoy myself for a few moments.Alas! that my soul took the path of departure. Alas! at the variegatedtable of life I partook a few mouthfuls, and the fates said, enough!"I explained the signification of these lines in Arabic to the Syrians.They were astonished that, at his advanced time of life, he shouldexpress himself so solicitous about a worldly existence. I asked him:"How do you now find yourself?" He replied: "What shall I say?--Hastthou never witnessed what torture that man suffers from whose jaw theyare extracting a tooth? Fancy to thyself how excruciating is his painfrom whose precious body they are tearing an existence!"I said: "Banish all thoughts of death from your mind, and let not doubtundermine your constitution; for the Greek philosophers have remarkedthat although our temperaments are vigorous, that is no proof of a longlife; and that although our sickness is dangerous, that is no positivesign of immediate dissolution. If you will give me leave, I will call ina physician to prescribe some medicine that may cure you." He replied:"Alas! alas! The landlord thinks of refreshing the paintings of hishall, and the house is tottering to its foundation. The physician smitesthe hands of despair when he sees the aged fallen in pieces like apotsherd; the old man bemoans himself in the agony of death while theold attendant nurse is anointing him with sandal-wood. When theequipoise of the temperament is overset, neither amulets nor medicamentscan do any good."       *       *       *       *       *IIIIn the territory of Diarbekr, or Mesopotamia, I was the guest of an oldman, who was very rich, and had a handsome son. One night he told astory, saying: "During my whole life I never had any child but this boy.And in this valley a certain tree is a place of pilgrimage, where peoplego to supplicate their wants; and many was the night that I havebesought God at the foot of that tree before he would bestow upon methis boy." I have heard that the son was also whispering his companions,and saying: "How happy I should be if I could discover the site of thattree, in order that I might pray for the death of my father." Thegentleman was rejoicing and saying: "What a sensible youth is my son!"and the boy was complaining and crying: "What a tedious old dotard is myfather!" Many years are passing over thy head, during which thou didstnot visit thy father's tomb. What pious oblation didst thou make to themanes of a parent that thou shouldst expect so much from thy son?IVUrged one day by the pride of youthful vanity, I had made a forcedmarch, and in the evening found myself exhausted at the bottom of anacclivity. A feeble old man, who had deliberately followed the pace ofthe caravan, came up to me and said: "How come you to lie down here? Getup, this is no fit place for rest." I replied: "How can I proceed, whohave not a foot to stand on?" He said: "Have you not heard what theprudent have remarked? 'Going on, and halting, is better than runningahead and breaking down!' Ye who wish to reach the end of your journey,hurry not on; practise my advice, and learn deliberation. The Arab horsemakes a few stretches at full speed, and is broken down; while thecamel, at its deliberate pace, travels on night and day, and gets to theend of his journey."VAn active, merry, cheerful, and sweet-spoken youth was for a length oftime in the circle of my society, whose heart had never known sorrow,nor his lip ceased from being on a smile. An age had passed, duringwhich we had not chanced to meet. When I next saw him he had taken tohimself a wife, and got a family; and the root of his enjoyment was tornup, and the rose of his mirth blasted. I asked him: "How is this?" Hereplied: "Since I became a father of children, I ceased to play thechild:--Now thou art old, relinquish childishness, and leave it to theyoung to indulge in play and merriment. Expect not the sprightliness ofyouth from the aged; for the stream that ran by can never return. Nowthat the corn is ripe for the sickle, it rears not its head as whengreen and shooting. The season of youth has slipt through my hands;alas! when I think on those heart-exhilarating days! The lion has lostthe sturdy grasp of his paw: I must now put up, like a lynx, with a bitof cheese. An old woman had stained her gray locks black. I said to her:O, my antiquated dame! thy hair I admit thou canst turn dark by art, butthou never canst make thy crooked back straight."VIOne day, in the perverseness of youth, I spoke with asperity to mymother. Vexed at heart, she sat down in a corner, and with tears in hereyes was saying: "You have perhaps forgot the days of infancy, that youare speaking to me thus harshly.--How well did an old woman observe toher own son, when she saw him powerful as a tiger, and formidable as anelephant: 'Couldst thou call to mind those days of thy infancy whenhelpless thou wouldst cling to this my bosom, thou wouldst not thusassail me with savage fury, now thou art a lion-like hero, and I am apoor old woman.'"VIIA rich miser had a son who was grievously sick. His well-wishers andfriends spoke to him, saying: "It were proper that you either read theKoran throughout or offer an animal in sacrifice, in order that the MostHigh God may restore him to health." After a short reflection withinhimself he answered, "It is better to read the Koran, which is ready athand; and my herds are at a distance." A good and holy man heard thisand remarked: "He makes choice of the reading part because the Koranslips glibly over the tongue, but his money is to be wrung from the soulof him. Fie upon that readiness to bow the head in prayer; would thatthe hand of charity could accompany it! In bestowing a dinar he willstickle like an ass in the mire; but ask him to read the Al-hamdi, orfirst chapter of the Koran, and he will recite it a hundred times."CHAPTER VIIOf the Impressions of EducationIA certain nobleman had a dunce of a son. He sent him to a learned man,saying: "Verily you will give instruction to this youth, peradventure hemay become a rational being." He continued to give him lessons for sometime, but they made no impression upon him, when he sent a message tothe father, saying: "This son is not getting wise, and he has well-nighmade me a fool!" Where the innate capacity is good, education may makean impression upon it; but no furbisher knows how to give a polish toiron which is of a bad temper. Wash a dog seven times in the ocean, andso long as he is wet he is all the filthier. Were they to take the assof Jesus to Mecca, on his return from that pilgrimage he would still bean ass.IIA philosopher was exhorting his children and saying: "O emanations of mysoul, acquire knowledge, as no reliance can be placed on worldly richesand possessions, for once you leave home rank is of no use, and gold andsilver on a journey are exposed to the risk either of thieves plunderingthem at once, or of the owner wasting them by degrees; but knowledge isa perennial spring and ever-during fortune. Were a professional man tolose his fortune, he need not feel regret, for his knowledge is ofitself a mine of wealth. Wherever he may sojourn the learned man willmeet respect, and be ushered into the upper seat, whilst the ignorantman must put up with offal and suffer want:--If thou covet the paternalheritage, acquire thy father's knowledge, for this thy father's wealththou may'st squander in ten days. After having been in authority, it ishard to obey; after having been fondled with caresses, to put up withmen's violence:--There once occurred an insurrection in Syria, andeverybody forsook his former peaceful abode. The sons of peasants, whowere men of learning, came to be employed as the ministers of kings; andthe children of noblemen, of bankrupt understandings, went a beggingfrom village to village."IIIA certain learned man was superintending the education of a king's son;and he was chastising him without mercy, and reproving him withasperity. The boy, out of all patience, complained to the king hisfather, and laid bare before him his much-bruised body. The king wasmuch offended, and sending for the master, said: "You do not treat thechildren of my meanest subject with the harshness and cruelty you do myboy; what do you mean by this?" He replied: "To think before they speak,and to deliberate before they act, are duties incumbent upon allmankind, and more immediately upon kings; because whatever may drop fromtheir hands and tongue, the special deed or word will somehow become thesubject of public animadversion; whereas any act or remark of thecommonalty attracts not such notice:--Let a dervish, or poor man, commita hundred indiscretions, and his companions will not notice one out ofthe hundred; and let a king but utter one foolish word, and it will beechoed from kingdom to kingdom:--therefore in forming the morals ofyoung princes, more pains are to be taken than with the sons of thevulgar. Whoever was not taught good manners in his boyhood, fortune willforsake him when he becomes a man. Thou may'st bend the green bough asthou likest; but let it once get dry, and it will require heat tostraighten it:--'_Verily thou may'st bend the tender branch, but it werelabor lost to attempt making straight a crooked billet_.'"The king greatly approved of this ingenious detail, and the wholesomecourse of discipline of the learned doctor; and, bestowing upon him adress and largess, raised him one step in his rank as a nobleman!IVIn the west of Africa I saw a schoolmaster of a sour aspect and bitterspeech, crabbed, misanthropic, beggarly, and intemperate, insomuch thatthe sight of him would derange the ecstasies of the orthodox; and hismanner of reading the Koran cast a gloom over the minds of the pious. Anumber of handsome boys and lovely virgins were subject to his despoticsway, who had neither the permission of a smile nor the option of aword, for this moment he would smite the silver cheek of one of themwith his hand, and the next put the crystalline legs of another in thestocks. In short their parents, I heard, were made aware of a part ofhis disloyal violence, and beat and drove him from his charge. And theymade over his school to a peaceable creature, so pious, meek, simple,and good-natured that he never spoke till forced to do so, nor would heutter a word that could offend anybody. The children forgot that awe inwhich they had held their first master, and remarking the angelicdisposition of their second master, they became one after another aswicked as devils; and relying on his clemency, they would so neglecttheir studies as to pass most part of their time at play, and break thetablets of their unfinished tasks over each other's heads:--"When theschoolmaster relaxes in his discipline, the children will stop to playat marbles in the market-place."A fortnight after I passed by the gate of that mosque and saw the firstschoolmaster, with whom they had been obliged to make friends, and torestore him to his place. I was in truth offended, and calling on God towitness, asked, saying: "Why have they again made a devil the preceptorof angels?" A facetious old gentleman, who had seen much of life,listened to me and replied: "Have you not heard what they have said:--Aking sent his son to school, and hung a tablet of silver round his neck.On the face of that tablet he had written in golden letters: 'Theseverity of the master is more useful than the indulgence of thefather.'"       *       *       *       *       *VIA king gave his son into the charge of a preceptor, and said: "This isyour child, educate him as you would one of your own." For some years helabored in teaching him, but to no good purpose; whilst the sons of thepreceptor excelled in eloquence and knowledge. The king blamed thelearned man, and remonstrated with him, saying: "You have violated yourtrust, and infringed the terms of your engagement." He replied: "O king,the education is the same, but their capacities are different!" Thoughsilver and gold are extracted from stones, yet it is not in every stonethat gold and silver are found. The Sohail, or star Canopus, is sheddinghis rays all over the globe. In one place he produces common leather, inanother, or in Yamin, that called Adim, or perfumed.VIII heard a certain learned senior observing to a disciple:--"If the sonsof Adam were as solicitous after Providence, or God, as they are aftertheir means of sustenance, their places in Paradise would surpass thoseof the angels." God did not overlook thee in that state when thou wert asenseless embryo in thy mother's womb. He bestowed upon thee a soul,reason, temper, intellect, symmetry, speech, judgment, understanding,and reflection. He accommodated thy hands with ten fingers, andsuspended two arms from thy shoulders. Canst thou now suppose, Ogood-for-nothing wretch, that he will forget to provide thy daily bread?VIIII observed an Arab who was informing his son:--"_O my child, God willask thee on the day of judgment: What hast thou done in this life? buthe will not inquire of thee: Whence didst thou derive thy origin?_" Thatis, they (or God) will ask, saying: "What are your works?" But he willnot question you, saying: "Who is your father?" The covering of theCaabah at Mecca, which the pilgrims kiss from devotion, is not prizedfrom its being the fabric of a silk-worm; for a while it associated witha venerable friend, and became, in consequence, venerable like him.IXThey have related in the books of philosophers that scorpions are notbrought forth according to the common course of nature, as other animalsare, but that they eat their way through their mother's wombs, tear opentheir bellies, and thus make themselves a passage into the world; andthat the fragments of skin which we find in scorpions' holes corroboratethis fact. On one occasion I was stating this strange event to a goodand great man, when he answered: "My heart is bearing testimony to thetruth of this remark; nor can it be otherwise, for as they have thusbehaved towards their parents in their youth, so they are approved andbeloved in their riper years." On his death-bed a father exhorted hisson, saying: "O generous youth, keep in mind this maxim: 'Whoever isungrateful to his own kindred cannot hope that fortune shall befriendhim.'"XThey asked a scorpion: "Why do you not make your appearance during thewinter?" It answered: "What is my character in the summer that I shouldcome abroad also in the winter?"       *       *       *       *       *XIIIOne year a dissension arose among the foot-travellers on a pilgrimage toMecca, and the author (Sa'di) was also a pedestrian among them. Intruth, we fell head and ears together, and accusation and recriminationwere bandied from all sides. I overheard a kajawah, or gentleman, ridingon one side of a camel-litter, observing to his adil, or oppositecompanion: "How strange that the ivory piyadah, or pawns, on reachingthe top of the shatranj, or chess-board, become fazzin, or queens; thatis, they get rank, or become better than they were; and the piyadah, orpawns, of the pilgrimage--that is, our foot-pilgrims--have crossed thedesert and become worse." Say from me to that haji, or pilgrim, the pestof his fellow-pilgrims, that he lacerates the skin of mankind by hiscontention. Thou art not a real pilgrim, but that meek camel is one whois feeding on thorns and patient under its burden.XIVA Hindu, or Indian, was teaching the art of playing off fireworks. Aphilosopher observed to him: "This is an unfit sport for you, whosedwelling is made of straw." Utter not a word till thou knowest that itis the mirror of what is correct; and do not put a question where thouknowest that the answer must be unfavorable.XVA fellow had a complaint in his eyes, and went to a horse-doctor,saying: "Prescribe something for me." The doctor of horses applied tohis eyes what he was in the habit of applying to the eyes of quadrupeds,and the man got blind. They carried their complaint before the hakim, orjudge. He decreed: "This man has no redress, for had he not been an asshe would not have applied to a horse or ass doctor!" The moral of thisapologue is, that whoever doth employ an inexperienced person on anaffair of importance, besides being brought to shame, he will incur fromthe wise the imputation of a weak mind. A prudent man, with anenlightened understanding, entrusts not affairs of consequence to one ofmean capacity. The plaiter of mats, notwithstanding he be a weaver, theywould not employ in a silk manufactory.XVIA certain great Imaam had a worthy son, and he died. They asked him,saying: "What shall we inscribe upon the urn at his tomb." He replied:"Verses of the holy Koran are of such superior reverence and dignitythat they should not be written in places where time might efface,mankind tread upon, or dogs defile them; yet, if an epitaph benecessary, let these two couplets suffice:--I said: 'Alas! how gratefulit was proving to my heart, so long as the verdure of thy existencemight flourish in the garden.' He replied: 'O my friend, have patiencetill the return of the spring, and thou may'st again see rosesblossoming on my bosom, or shooting from my dust.'"XVIIA holy man was passing by a wealthy personage's mansion, and saw himwith a slave tied up by the hands and feet, and giving him chastisement.He said: "O my son! God Almighty has made a creature like yourselfsubject to your command, and has given you a superiority over him.Render thanksgiving to the Most High Judge, and deal not with him sosavagely; lest hereafter, on the day of judgment, he may prove the moreworthy of the two, and you be put to shame:--Be not so enraged with thybondsman; torture not his body, nor harrow up his heart. Thou mightestbuy him for ten dinars, but hadst not after all the power of creatinghim:--To what length will this authority, pride, and insolence hurrythee; there is a Master mightier than thou art. Yes, thou art a lord ofslaves and vassals, but do not forget thine own Lord Paramount--namely,God!" There is a tradition of the prophet Mohammed, on whom be blessing,announcing:--On the day of resurrection, that will be the mostmortifying event when the good slave will be taken up to heaven, and thewicked master sent down to hell:--"Upon the bondsman, who is subservientto thy command, wreak not thy rage and boundless displeasure. For itmust be disgraceful on the day of reckoning to find the slave at libertyand the master in bondage."XVIIIOne year I was on a journey with some Syrians from Balkh, and the roadwas infested with robbers. One of our escort was a youth expert atwielding his shield and brandishing his spear, mighty as an elephant,and cased in armor, so strong that ten of the most powerful of us couldnot string his bow, or the ablest wrestler on the face of the earththrow him on his back. Yet, as you must know, he had been brought up inluxury and reared in a shade, was inexperienced of the world, and hadnever travelled. The thunder of the great war-drum had never rattled inhis ears, nor had the lightning of the trooper's scimitar ever flashedacross his eyes:--He had never fallen a captive into the hands of anenemy, nor been overwhelmed amidst a shower of their arrows.It happened that this young man and I kept running on together; and anyvenerable ruin that might come in our way he would overthrow with thestrength of his shoulder; and any huge tree that we might see he wouldwrench from its root with his lion-seizing wrist, and boastfullycry:--"Where is the elephant, that he may behold the shoulder and arm ofwarriors? Where the lion, that he may feel the wrist and grip ofheroes?"Such was our situation when two Hindus darted from behind a rock andprepared to cut us off, one of them holding a bludgeon in his hand, andthe other having a mallet under his arm. I called to the young man, "Whydo you stop?--Display whatever strength and courage thou hast, for thefoe came on his own feet up to his grave":--I perceived that the youth'sbow and arrows had dropped from his hands, and that a tremor had fallenupon his limbs:--It is not he that can split a hair with a coat-of-mailcleaving arrow that is able to withstand an assault from theformidable:--No alternative was left us but that of surrendering ourarms, accoutrements, and clothes, and escaping with our lives. On anaffair of importance employ a man experienced in business who can bringthe fierce lion within the noose of his halter; though the youth bestrong of arm and has the body of an elephant, in his encounter with afoe every limb will quake with fear. A man of experience is bestqualified to explore a field of battle, as one of the learned is toexpound a point of law.XIXI saw a rich man's son seated by his father's tomb, and in a disputationwith that of a dervish holding forth and saying: "My father's mausoleumis built of granite, the epitaph inscribed with letters of gold, thepavement and lining marble, and tessellated with slabs of turquoise; andwhat is there left of your father's tomb but two or three brickscemented together with a few handfuls of mortar?" The poor man's sonheard this, and answered: "I pray you peace! for before your father canstir himself under this heavy load of stone mine shall have risen up toheaven!" And there is a tradition of the prophet, that _death to thepoor is a state of rest_. That ass proceeds all the lighter on hisjourney on whom they load the lightest burden:--the poor dervish, whosuffers under a load of indigence, will in like sort enter the gates ofdeath with an easy burden; but with him who luxuriates in peace, plenty,and affluence, it must be a real hardship to die amidst all thesecomforts. At all events consider the prisoner, who is released from histhraldom, as better off than the prince who is just fallen a captive.       *       *       *       *       *XXII saw a certain person in the garb of dervishes, but not with theirmeekness, seated in a company, and full of his abuse. Having opened thevolume of reproach, and begun to calumniate the rich, his discourse hadreached this place, stating: "The hand of the poor man's ability is tiedup, and the foot of the rich man's inclination crippled:--Men ofliberality have no command of money, nor have the opulent andworldly-minded a spirit of liberality."Owing, as I am, my support to the bounty of the great, I considered thisanimadversion as unmerited, and replied: "O my friend! the rich are thetreasury of the indigent, the granary of the hermit, the fane of thepilgrim, resting-place of the traveller, and the carriers of heavyburdens for the relief of their fellow-creatures. They put forth theirhand to eat when their servants and dependants are ready to partake withthem; and the bounteous fragments of their tables they distribute amongwidows and the aged, their neighbors and kindred:--The rich have theirconsecrated foundations, charitable endowments and rites of hospitality;their alms, oblations, manumissions, peace-offerings, and sacrifices.How shalt thou rise to this pomp of fortune who canst perform only thesetwo genuflexions, and them after manifold difficulties?--Whether itrespect their moral dignity or religious duty, the rich are at easewithin themselves; for their property is sanctified by giving tithes,and their apparel hallowed by cleanliness, their reputationsunblemished, and minds content. The intelligent are aware that the zealof devotion is warmed by good fare, and the sincerity of piety renderedmore serene in a nicety of vesture; for it is evident what ardor therecan be in a hungry stomach; what generosity in squalid penury; whatability of travelling with a bare foot; and what alacrity at bestowingfrom an empty hand:--Uneasy must be the night-slumbers of him whoseprovision for to-morrow is not forthcoming: the ant is laying by a storein summer that she may enjoy an abundance in winter. It is clear thatindigence and tranquillity can never go together, nor have fruition andwant the same aspect: the one had composed himself for prayer, and theother sat anxious, and thinking on his supper; how then could this evercome in competition with that? The lord of plenty has his mind fixed onGod; when a man's fortune is bankrupt, so is his heart:--accordingly,the devotion of the rich is more acceptable at the temple of God,because their thoughts are present and collected, and their minds notabsent and distracted; for they have laid up the conveniences of goodliving, and digested at their leisure their scriptural quotations (forprayer). The Arabs say: '_God preserve us from overwhelming poverty; andfrom the company of him whom he loves not, namely, the infidel_':--Andthere is a tradition of the prophet--that '_poverty has a gloomy aspectin this world and in the next_!'"My antagonist said: "Have you not heard what the blessed prophet hasdeclared?--'_poverty is my glory!_'" I replied: "Be silent, for theallusion of the Lord of both worlds applies to such as are heroes in thefield of resignation, and the devoted victims of their fate, and not tothose who put on the garb of piety, that they may entitle themselves tothe bread of charity. O noisy drum! thou art nothing but an empty sound;unprovided with the means, what canst thou effect on the last day ofaccount? If thou art a man of spirit, turn thy face away from beggingcharity from thy fellow-creature; and keep not repeating thy rosary of athousand beads. Being without divine knowledge, a dervish, or poor man,rests not till his poverty settles into infidelity; for _he that is pooris well-nigh being an infidel_:--nor is it practicable, unless throughthe agency of wealth, to clothe the naked, and to liberate the prisonerfrom jail: how then can such mendicants as we are aspire to theirdignity; or what comparison is there between the arm of the lofty andthe hand of the abject? Do you not perceive that the glorious and greatGod announces, in the holy book of the Koran, xxviii, the enjoyments ofthe blessed in Paradise?--that '_to this community, namely, the orthodoxMussulmans, a provision is allotted_';--in order that you mayunderstand that such as are solely occupied in looking after their dailysubsistence are excluded from this portion of the blessed; and that theproperty of present enjoyment is sanctioned under the seal ofProvidence:--to the thirsty it will seem in their dreams as if the faceof the earth were wholly a fountain. You may everywhere observe that,instigated by his appetites, a person who has suffered hardship andtasted bitterness will engage in dangerous enterprises; and, indifferentto the consequences, and unawed by future punishments, he will notdiscriminate between what is lawful and what is forbid:--Should a clodof earth be thrown at the head of a dog, he would jump up in joy, andtake it for a bone; or were two people carrying a corpse on a bier, agreedy man would fancy it a tray of victuals. Whereas the worldlyopulent are regarded with the benevolent eye of Providence, and in theirenjoyments of what is lawful are preserved from things illegal. Havingthus detailed my arguments and adduced my proofs, I rely on your justicefor an equitable decree; whether you ever saw a felon with his armspinioned; a bankrupt immured in a jail; the veil of innocency rent, orthe arm mutilated for theft, unless in consequence of poverty: forlion-like heroes, instigated by want, have been caught underminingwalls, and breaking into houses, and have got themselves suspended bythe heels. It is, moreover, possible that a poor man, urged to it by aninordinate appetite, may feel desirous of gratifying his lust; and hemay fall the victim of some accursed sin. And of the manifold means ofmental tranquillity and corporeal enjoyment which are the special lotsof the opulent, one is that every night they can command a freshmistress, and every day possess a new charmer, such as must excite theenvy of the glorious dawn, and stick the foot of the stately cypress inthe mire of shame:--'She had dipped her hands in the blood of herlovers, and tinged the tips of her fingers with jujubes':--so that itwere impossible, with such lovely objects before their eyes, for them todesire what is forbidden or to wish to commit sin:--Why should such aheart as the houris, or nymphs of Paradise, have captivated andplundered, show any way partial to the idols of Yaghma (a city inTurkestan famous for its beauties)?--_He who has in both his hands suchdates as he can relish, will not think of throwing stones at the bunchesof dates on their trees_. In common, such as are in indigentcircumstances will contaminate the skirt of innocency with sin; and suchas are suffering from hunger will steal bread:--When a ravenous dog hasfound a piece of meat, he asks not, saying: Is this the flesh of theprophet Salah's camel or Antichrist's ass? Many are the chaste who,because of their poverty, have fallen into the sink of wickedness, andgiven their fair reputations to the blast of infamy:--The virtue oftemperance remains not with a state of being famished; and bankruptcircumstances will snatch the rein from the hand of abstemiousness."The moment I had finished this speech, the dervish, my antagonist, letthe rein of forbearance drop from the hand of moderation; unsheathed thesabre of his tongue; set the steed of eloquence at full speed over theplain of arrogance; and, galloping up to me, said: "You have soexaggerated in their praise, and amplified with such extravagance, thatwe might fancy them an antidote to the poison of poverty and a key tothe store-house of Providence; yet they are a proud, self-conceited,fastidious, and overbearing set, insatiate after wealth and property,and ambitious of rank and dignity; who exchange not a word but toexpress insolence, or deign a look but to show contempt. Men of sciencethey call beggars, and the indigent they reproach for their wretchedraggedness. Proud of the property they possess, and vain of the rankthey claim, they take the upper hand of all, and deem themselveseverybody's superior. Nor do they ever condescend to return any person'ssalutation, unmindful of the maxim of the wise: That whoever is inferiorto others in humility, and is their superior in opulence, though inappearance he be rich, yet in reality he is a beggar:--If a worthlessfellow, because of his wealth, treats a learned man with insolence,reckon him an ass, although he be the ambergris ox."I replied: "Do not calumniate the rich, for they are the lords ofmunificence." He said: "You mistake them, for they are the slaves ofdinars and dirams, or their gold and silver coins. For example, whatprofits it though they be the clouds of the spring, if they may not sendus rain; or the fountain of the sun, and shine upon no one; or thoughthey be mounted on the steed of capability, and advance not towardsanybody? They will not move a step for the sake of God, nor bestow theircharity without laying you under obligation and thanks. They hoardtheir money with solicitude, watch it while they live with sordidmeanness, and leave it behind them with deadening regret, verifying thesaying of the wise: 'That the money of the miser is coming out of theearth when he is himself going into it:'--One man hoards a treasure withpain and tribulation, another comes and spends it without tribulation orpain."I replied: "You could have ascertained the parsimony of the wealthy onlythrough the medium of your own beggary; otherwise to him who layscovetousness aside the generous man and miser seem all one. Thetouchstone can prove which is pure gold, and the beggar can say which isthe niggard." He said: "I speak of them from experience; for theystation dependants by their doors, and plant surly porters at theirgates, to deny admittance to the worthy, and to lay violent hands uponthe collars of the elect, and say: 'There is nobody at home'; and verilythey tell what is true:--When the master has not reason or judgment,understanding or discernment, the porter reported right of him, saying:'There is nobody in the house.'"I replied: "They are excusable, inasmuch as they are worried out oftheir lives by importunate memorialists, and jaded to their hearts byindigent solicitors; and it might be reasonably doubted whether it wouldsatisfy the eye of the covetous if the sands of the desert could beturned into pearls:--The eye of the greedy is not to be filled withworldly riches, any more than a well can be replenished from the dew ofnight. And had Hatim Tayi, who dwelt in the desert, come to live in acity, he would have been overwhelmed with the importunities ofmendicants, and they would have torn the clothes from his back:--Looknot towards me, lest thou should draw the eyes of others, for at themendicant's hand no good can be expected."He said: "I pity their condition." I replied: "Not so; but you envy themtheir property." We were thus warm in argument, and both of us closeengaged. Whatever chess pawn he might advance I would set one inopposition to it; and whenever he put my king in check, I would relievehim with my queen; till he had exhausted all the coin in the purse ofhis resolution, and expended all the arrows of the quiver of hisargument. "Take heed and retreat not from the orator's attack, fornothing is left him but metaphor and hyperbole. Wield thy polemics andlaw citations, for the wordy rhetorician made a show of arms over hisgate, but has not a soldier within his fort":--At length, having nosyllogism left, I made him crouch in mental submission. He stretchedforth the arm of violence, and began with vain abuse. As is the casewith the ignorant, when beaten by their antagonist in fair argument,they shake the chain of rancor; like Azor, the idol-maker, when he couldno longer contend with his son Abraham in words he fell upon him withblows, as God has said in the Koran--"_If thou wilt not yield thispoint, I will overwhelm thee with stones_:"--He gave me abuse, and Iretorted upon him with asperity; he tore my collar, and I plucked hisbeard:--He had fallen upon me and I upon him, and a crowd had gatheredround us enjoying the sport. A whole world gnawed the finger ofastonishment when it heard and understood what had taken place betweenus.In short, we referred our dispute to the cazi, and agreed to abide byhis equitable decree: That the judge of the Mussulmans, or faithful,might bring about a peace, and discriminate for us between the poor andrich. After having noted our physiognomies, and listened to ourstatements, the cazi rested his chin on the breast of deliberation; and,after due consideration, raised it, and said: "Be it known to you, whowere lavish in your praise of the rich, and spoke disparagingly of thepoor, that there is no rose without its thorn; intoxication from wine isfollowed by a qualm; hidden treasure has its guardian dragon; where theimperial pearl is found, there swims the man-devouring shark; the honeyof worldly enjoyment has the sting of death in its rear; and between usand the felicity of Paradise stands a frightful demon, namely, Satan. Solong as the charmer slew not her admirer, what could the rival's maliceavail him? The rose and thorn, the treasure and dragon, joy and sorrow,all mingle into one.--Do you not observe that in the garden there arethe sweet-scented willows and the withered trunks; so among the classesof the rich some are grateful and some thankless; and among the ordersof the poor some are resigned and some impatient:--Were every drop ofdew to turn into a pearl, in the market pearls would be as common asshells. Near by the throne of a great and glorious Judge are the richmeek in spirit, and the poor rich in resolution. And the chief of theopulent is he who sympathizes with the sorrows of the indigent; and themost virtuous of the indigent is he who covets not the society of theopulent:--_God is all-sufficient for him who trusts in God_."Then the cazi turned the face of animadversion from me towards thedervish, and said: "O you who have charged the rich with being active insin, and intoxicated with things forbidden, verily there is such a tribeas you have described them, illiberal in their bigotry, and stingy ofGod's bounty; who are collecting and hoarding money, but will neitheruse nor bestow it. If, for example, there was a drought, or if the wholeearth was deluged with a flood, confident of their own abundance, theywould not inquire after the poor man's distress, and, fearless of thedivine wrath, exclaim:--If, in his want of everything, another person beannihilated, I have plenty; and what does a goose care for a deluge?_Such as are lolling in their litters, and indulging in the easy pace ofa female camel, feel not for the foot-traveller perishing amidstoverwhelming sands:_--The mean-spirited, when they could escape withtheir own rugs, would cry: 'What care we should the whole world die.'"Such as you have stated them, there is a tribe of rich men; but thereis another class, who, having spread the table of abundance, and made apublic declaration of their munificence, and smoothed the brow of theirhumility, are solicitous of a reputation and forgiveness, and desirousof enjoying this world and the next; like unto the servants of hisMajesty the sovereign of the universe, just, confirmed, victorious, lordparamount and conqueror of nations, defender of the stronghold ofIslamism, successor of Solomon, most equitable of contemporary kings.Mozuffar-ud-din Atabak-Abubakr-Saad, may God give him a long life, andgrant victory to his standards!--A father could never show suchbenevolence to his son as thy liberal hand has bestowed upon the race ofAdam. The Deity was desirous of conferring a kindness upon man, and inhis special mercy made thee sovereign of the world."Now that the cazi had carried his harangue to this extreme, and hadgalloped the steed of metaphor beyond our expectation, we of necessityacquiesced in the absolute decree of being satisfied, and apologized forwhat had passed between us; and after altercation we returned into thepath of reconciliation, laid the heads of reparation at each other'sfeet, mutually kissed and embraced, and, letting mischief fall asleep,and war lull itself into peace, concluded the whole in these twoverses:--"O poor man! complain not of the revolutions of fortune, forgloomy might be thy lot wert thou to die in such sentiments. And now, Orich man! that thy hand and heart administer to thy pleasures, spend andgive away, that thou may'st enjoy this world and the next."CHAPTER VIIIOf the Duties of SocietyIRiches are intended for the comfort of life, and not life for thepurpose of hoarding riches. I asked a wise man, saying: "Who is thefortunate man, and who is the unfortunate?" He said: "That man wasfortunate who spent and gave away, and that man unfortunate who died andleft behind:--Pray not for that good-for-nothing man who did nothing,for he passed his life in hoarding riches, and did not spend them."IIThe prophet Moses, on whom be peace, _admonished Carum, saying: "Bebounteous in like manner as God has been bounteous to thee_":--but helistened not, and you have heard the end of him. Whoever did not an actof charity with his silver and gold, sacrificed his future prospects onhis hoard of gold and silver. If desirous that thou shouldst benefit bythe wealth of this world, be generous with thy fellow-creature, as Godhas been generous with thee.The Arabs say:--"_Show thy generosity, but make it not obligatory, thatthe benefit of it may redound to thee_":--that is, bestow and makepresents, but do not exact an obligation that the profit of that act maybe returned to you. Wherever the tree of generosity strikes root itsends forth its boughs, and they shoot above the skies. If thoucherishest a hope of enjoying its fruit, by gratitude I entreat of theenot to lay a saw upon its trunk. Render thanks to God, that thou wertfound worthy of his divine grace, that he has not excluded thee from theriches of his bounty. Esteem it no obligation that thou art serving theking, but show thy gratitude to him, namely God, who has placed thee inthis service.IIITwo persons labored to a vain, and studied to an unprofitable end: hewho hoarded wealth and did not spend it, and he who acquired science anddid not practise it:--However much thou art read in theory, if thou hastno practice thou art ignorant. He is neither a sage philosopher nor anacute divine, but a beast of burden with a load of books. How can thatbrainless head know or comprehend whether he carries on his back alibrary or bundle of fagots?IVLearning is intended to fortify religious practice, and not to gratifyworldly traffic:--Whoever prostituted his temperance, piety, andscience, gathered his harvest into a heap and set fire to it.VAn intemperate man of learning is like a blind link-boy:--_He shows theroad to others, but sees it not himself_:--whoever ventured his life onan unproductive hazard gained nothing by the risk, and lost his ownstake.VIA kingdom is embellished by the wise, and religion rendered illustriousby the pious. Kings stand more in need of the company of the intelligentthan the intelligent do of the society of kings:--If, O king! thou wiltlisten to my advice, in all thy archives thou canst not find a wisermaxim than this: entrust thy concerns only to the learned,notwithstanding business is not a learned man's concern.VIIThree things have no durability without their concomitants: propertywithout trade, knowledge without debate, or a sovereignty withoutgovernment.VIIITo compassionate the wicked is to tyrannize over the good; and to pardonthe oppressor is to deal harshly with the oppressed:--When thoupatronizest and succorest the base-born man, he looks to be made thepartner of thy fortune.IXNo reliance can be placed on the friendship of kings, nor vain hope putin the melodious voice of boys; for that passes away like a vision, andthis vanishes like a dream:--Bestow not thy affections upon a mistresswho has a thousand lovers; or, if thou bestowest them upon her, beprepared for a separation.XReveal not every secret you have to a friend, for how can you tell butthat friend may hereafter become an enemy? And bring not all themischief you are able to do upon an enemy, for he may one day becomeyour friend. And any private affair that you wish to keep secret, do notdivulge to anybody; for, though such a person has your confidence, nonecan be so true to your secret as yourself:--Silence is safer than tocommunicate the thought of thy mind to anybody, and to warn him, saying:Do not divulge it, O silly man! confine the water at the dam-head, foronce it has a vent thou canst not stop it. Thou shouldst not utter aword in secret which thou wouldst not have spoken in the face of thepublic.XIA reduced foe, who offers his submission and courts your amity, can onlyhave in view to become a strong enemy, as they have said: "You cannottrust the sincerity of friends, then what are you to expect from thecajoling of foes?" Whoever despises a weak enemy resembles him whoneglects a spark of fire:--To-day that thou canst quench it, put itout; for let fire rise into a flame, and it may consume a whole world.Now that thou canst transfix him with thy arrow, permit not thyantagonist to string his bow.XIIIWhoever is making a league with their enemies has it in his mind to dohis friends an ill turn:--"O wise man! wash thy hands of that friend whois in confederacy with thy foes."XIVWhen irresolute in the despatch of business, incline to that side whichis the least offensive:--Answer not with harshness a mild-spoken man,nor force him into war who knocks at the gate of peace.XVSo long as money can answer, it were wrong in any business to put thelife in danger:--as the Arabs say:--"_let the sword decide afterstratagem has failed_":--When the hand is balked in every craftyendeavor, it is lawful to lay it upon the hilt of the sabre.XVIShow no mercy to a subdued foe, for if he recover himself he will showyou no mercy:--When thou seest thy antagonist in a reduced state, curlnot thy whiskers at him in contempt, for in every bone there is marrow,and within every jacket there is a man.XVIIWhoever puts a wicked man to death delivers mankind from his mischief,and the wretch himself from God's vengeance:--Beneficence ispraiseworthy; yet thou shouldst not administer a balsam to the wound ofthe wicked. Knew he not who took compassion on a snake, that it is thepest of the sons of Adam.XVIIIIt is wrong to follow the advice of an adversary; nevertheless it isright to hear it, that you may do the contrary; and this is the essenceof good policy:--Sedulously shun whatever thy foe may recommend,otherwise thou may'st wring the hands of repentance on thy knees. Shouldhe show thee to the right a path straight as an arrow, turn aside fromthat, and take the path to the left.       *       *       *       *       *XXTwo orders of mankind are the enemies of church and state: the kingwithout clemency, and the holy man without learning:--Let not thatprince have rule over the state who is not himself obedient to the willof God.XXIIt behooves a king so to regulate his anger towards his enemies as notto alarm the confidence of his friends; for the fire of passion fallsfirst on the angry man; afterwards its sparks will dart forth towardsthe foe, and him they may reach, or they may not. It ill becomes thechildren of Adam, formed of dust, to harbor in their head such pride,arrogance, and passion. I cannot fancy all this thy warmth and obstinacyto be created from earth, but from fire. I went to a holy man in theland of Bailcan, and said: "Cleanse me of ignorance by thy instruction?"He replied: "O fakir, or theologician! go and bear things patiently likethe earth; or whatever thou hast read let it all be buried under theearth."XXIIAn evil-disposed man is a captive in the hands of an enemy (namely,himself); for wherever he may go he cannot escape from the grasp of thatenemy's vengeance:--Let a wicked man ascend up to heaven, that he mayescape from the grasp of calamity; even thither would the hand of hisown evil heart follow him with misfortune.XXIIIWhen you see discord raging among the troops of your enemy, be on yourside quiet; but if you see them united, think of your own dispersedstate:--When thou beholdest war among thy foes, go and enjoy peace withthy friends; but if thou findest them of one soul and mind, string thybow, and range stones around thy battlements.       *       *       *       *       *XXVIKeep to yourself any intelligence that may prove unpleasant, till someperson else has disclosed it:--Bring, O nightingale! the glad tidings ofthe spring, and leave to the owl to be the harbinger of evil.       *       *       *       *       *XXVIIIWhoever is counselling a self-sufficient man stands himself in need of acounsellor.XXIXSwallow not the wheedling of a rival, nor pay for the sycophancy of aparasite; for that has laid the snare of treachery, and this whetted thepalate of gluttony. The fool is puffed up with his own praise, like adead body, which on being stretched upon a bier shows a momentarycorpulency:--Take heed and listen not to the sycophant's blandishments,who expects in return some small compensation; for shouldst thou any daydisappoint his object he would in like style sum up two hundred of thydefects.XXXTill some person may show its defects, the speech of the orator willfail of correctness:--Be not vain of the eloquence of thy discoursebecause it has the fool's good opinion, and thine own approbation.XXXIEvery person thinks his own intellect perfect, and his own childhandsome:--A Mussulman and a Jew were warm in argument to such a degreethat I smiled at their subject. The Mussulman said in wrath: "If thisdeed of conveyance be not authentic may I, O God, die a Jew!" The Jewreplied: "On the Pentateuch I swear, if what I say be false, I am aMussulman like you!" Were intellect to be annihilated from the face ofthe earth, nobody could be brought to say: "I am ignorant."XXXIITen people will partake of the same joint of meat, and two dogs willsnarl over a whole carcase. The greedy man is incontinent with a wholeworld set before him; the temperate man is content with his crust ofbread:--A loaf of brown bread may fill an empty stomach, but the produceof the whole globe cannot satisfy a greedy eye:--My father, when the sunof his life was going down, gave me this sage advice, and it set forgood, saying: "Lust is a fire; refrain from indulging it, and do notinvolve thyself in the flames of hell. Since thou hast not the strengthof burning in those flames (as a punishment in the next world), pour inthis world the water of continence upon this fire--namely, lust."XXXIIIWhoever does not do good, when he has the means of doing it, will sufferhardship when he has not the means:--None is more unlucky than themisanthrope, for on the day of adversity he has not a single friend.XXXIVLife stands on the verge of a single breath; and this world is anexistence between two nonentities. Such as truck their deen, orreligious practice, for worldly pelf are asses. They sold Joseph, andwhat got they by their bargain?--"_Did I not covenant with you, O yesons of Adam, that you should not serve Satan; for verily he is youravowed enemy_":--By the advice of a foe you broke your faith with afriend; behold from whom you separated, and with whom you unitedyourselves.       *       *       *       *       *XXXVIWhatever is produced in haste goes hastily to waste:--I have heard that,after a process of forty years, they convert the clay of the East into aChina porcelain cup. At Bagdad they can make an hundred cups in a day,and thou may'st of course conceive their respective value. A chickenwalks forth from its shell, and goes in quest of its food; the young ofman possesses not that instinct of prudence and discrimination. Thatwhich was at once something comes to nothing; and this surpasses allcreatures in dignity and wisdom. A piece of crystal or glass is foundeverywhere, and held of no value; a ruby is obtained with difficulty,and therefore inestimable.XXXVIIPatience accomplishes its object, while hurry speeds to its ruin:--Withmy own eyes I saw in the desert that the deliberate man outstripped himthat had hurried on. The wing-footed steed is broken down in his speed,whilst the camel-driver jogs on with his beast to the end of hisjourney.XXXVIIINothing is so good for an ignorant man as silence, and if he knew thishe would no longer be ignorant:--When unadorned with the grace ofeloquence it is wise to keep watch over the tongue in the mouth. Thetongue, by abuse, renders a man contemptible; levity in a nut is a signof its being empty. A fool was undertaking the instruction of an ass,and had devoted his whole time to this occupation. A wise man said tohim: "What art thou endeavoring to do? In this vain attempt dread thereproof of the censorious! A brute can never learn speech from thee; dothou learn silence from him." That man who reflects not before he speakswill only make all the more improper answer. Either like a man arrangethy speech with judgment, or like a brute sit silent.XXXIXWhoever shall argue with one more learned than himself that others maytake him for a wise man, only confirms them in his being a fool:--"Whena person superior to what thou art engages thee in conversation do notcontradict him, though thou may'st know better."XLHe can see no good who will associate with the wicked:--Were an angelfrom heaven to associate with a demon, he would learn his brutality,perfidy, and hypocrisy. Virtue thou never canst learn of the vicious; itis not the wolf's occupation to mend skins, but to tear them.XLIExpose not the secret failings of mankind, otherwise you must verilybring scandal upon them and distrust upon yourself.XLIIWhoever acquires knowledge and does not practise it resembles him whoploughs his land and leaves it unsown.       *       *       *       *       *XLVIIt is not every man that has a handsome physical exterior that has agood moral character; for the faculty of business or virtue resides inthe heart and not in the skin. Thou canst in one day ascertain theintellectual faculties of a man, and what proficiency he has made in hisdegrees of knowledge; but be not secure of his mind, nor foolishly sure,for it may take years to detect the innate baseness of the heart.XLVIIWhoever contends with the great sheds his own blood:--Thou contemplatestthyself as a mighty great man; and they have truly remarked that thesquinter sees double. Thou who canst in play butt with a ram must soonfind thyself with a broken pate.XLVIIITo grapple with a lion, or to box against a naked scimitar, are not theacts of the prudent:--Brave not the furious with war and oppositionbefore their arms of strength cross thy hands of submission.XLIXA weak man who tries his courage against the strong leagues with the foeto his own destruction:--Nurtured in a shade, what strength can he havethat he should engage with the warlike in battle; impotent of arm, hewas falling the victim of folly when he set his wrist in opposition to awrist of iron.LWhoever will not listen to admonition harbors the fancy of hearingreprehension:--When advice gains not an admission into the ear, if Igive thee reproof, hear it in silence.LIThe idle cannot endure the industrious any more than the curs of themarket-place, who, on meeting dogs employed for sporting, will snarl atand prevent them passing.LIIA mean wretch that cannot vie with another in virtue will assail himwith malignity:--The narrow-minded envier will somehow manage to revilethee, who in thy presence might have the tongue of his utterance struckdumb.       *       *       *       *       *LVTo hold counsel with women is bad, and to deal generouslywith prodigals a fault:--Showing mercy upon the sharp-fangedpard must prove an injustice to the harmless sheep.LVIWhoever has his foe at his mercy, and does not kill him, is his ownenemy:--With a stone in his hand, and the snake's head convenient, awise man hesitates not in crushing it.Certain people have seen this maxim in an opposite point of view,saying: "It were wiser to delay the execution of captives, inasmuch asthe option is left so that you can slay, or you can release them; but ifyou shall have heedlessly put them to death, the policy is defunct, forthe opportunity of repairing it is lost":--There is no great difficultyto separate the soul from the body, but it is not so easy to restorelife to the dead: prudence dictates patience in giving the arrow flight,for let it quit the bow and it never can be recalled.LVIIA learned man who has got into an argument with the ignorant can have nohopes of supporting his own dignity; and if an ignoramus by hisloquacity gets the upper hand it should not surprise us, for he is astone and can bruise a gem:--No wonder if his spirit flag; thenightingale is cooped up in the same cage with the crow:--If the man ofsense is coarsely treated by the vulgar, let it not excite our wrath andindignation; if a piece of worthless stone can bruise a cup of gold, itsworth is not increased, nor that of the gold diminished.       *       *       *       *       *LXGenius without education is the subject of our regret, and educationwithout genius is labor lost. Although embers have a lofty origin (firebeing of a noble nature), yet, as having no intrinsic worth, they fallupon a level with common dust; on the other hand, sugar does not deriveits value from the cane, but from its own innate quality:--Inasmuch asthe disposition of Canaan was bad, his descent from the prophet Noahstood him in no stead. Pride thyself on what virtue thou hast, and noton thy parentage; the rose springs from a thorn-bush, and Abraham fromAzor (neither his father's name, or fire).LXIThat is musk which discloses itself by its smell, and not what theperfumers impose upon us:--If a man be expert in any art he needs nottell it, for his own skill will show it.LXIIA wise man is, like a vase in a druggist's shop, silent, but full ofvirtues; and the ignorant man resembles the drum of the warrior, beingfull of noise, and an empty babbler:--The sincerely devout have remarkedthat a learned man beset by the illiterate is like one of the lovely ina circle of the blind, or the holy Koran in the dwelling of the infidel.LXIIIA friend whom they take an age to conciliate, it were wrong all at onceto alienate:--In a series of years a stone changes into a ruby; takeheed, and destroy it not at once by dashing it against another stone.LXIVReason is in like manner enthralled by passion, as an uxorious man is inthe hands of an artful woman. Thou may'st shut the door of joy upon thatdwelling where thou hearest resounding the scolding voice of a woman.LXVIntellect, without firmness, is craft and chicanery; and firmness,without intellect, perverseness and obstinacy:--First, prudence, goodsense, and discrimination, and then dominion; for the dominion and goodfortune of the ignorant are the armor of rebellion against God.LXVIThe sinner who spends and gives away is better than the devotee who begsand lays by.LXVIIWhoever foregoes carnal indulgence in order to get the good opinion ofmankind, has forsaken a lawful passion and involved himself in what isforbidden:--What, wretched creature! can that hermit see in his owntarnished mirror, or heart, who retires to a cell, but not for the sakeof God?LXIXA wise man should not through clemency overlook the insolence of thevulgar, otherwise both sustain a loss, for their respect for him islessened and their own brutality confirmed:--When thou addressest thelow with urbanity and kindness, it only adds to their pride andarrogance.       *       *       *       *       *LXXIVIn a season of drought and scarcity ask not the distressed dervish,saying: "How are you?" Unless on the condition that you apply a balm tohis wound, and supply him with the means of subsistence:--The ass whichthou seest stuck in the slough with his rider, compassionate from thyheart, otherwise do not go near him. Now that thou went and asked himhow he fell, like a sturdy fellow bind up thy loins, and take his ass bythe tail.LXXVTwo things are repugnant to reason: to expend more than what Providencehas allotted for us, and to die before our ordained time:--Whetheroffered up in gratitude, or uttered in complaint, destiny cannot bealtered by a thousand sighs and lamentations. The angel who presidesover the store-house of the winds feels no compunction, though heextinguish the old woman's lamp.LXXVIO you that are going in quest of food, sit down, that you may have toeat. And, O you that death is in quest of, go not on, for you cannotcarry life along with you:--In search of thy daily bread, whether thouexertest thyself, or whether thou dost not, the God of Majesty and Glorywill equally provide it. Wert thou to walk into the mouth of a tiger orlion, he could not devour thee, unless by the ordinance of thy destiny.LXXVIIWhatever was not designed, the hand cannot reach; and whatever wasordained, it can attain in any situation:--Thou hast heard thatAlexander got as far as chaos; but after all this toil he drank not thewater of immortality.LXXVIIIThe fisherman, unless it be his lot, catches no fish in the Tigris; andthe fish, unless it be its fate, does not die on the dry land:--Thewretched miser is prowling all over the world, he in quest of pelf, anddeath in quest of him.       *       *       *       *       *LXXXIThe envious man is niggard of the gifts of Providence, and an enemy ofthe innocent:--I met a dry-brained fellow of this sort, tricked forth inthe robe of a dignified person. I said: "O sir! if thou art unfortunatein having this disposition, in what have the fortunate been toblame?--Take heed, and wish not misfortune to the misanthrope, for hisown ill-conditioned lot is calamity sufficient. What need is there ofshowing ill-will to him, who has such an enemy close at his heels."LXXXIIA scholar without diligence is a lover without money; a travellerwithout knowledge is a bird without wings; a theorist without practiceis a tree without fruit; and a devotee without learning is a housewithout an entrance.LXXXIIIThe object of sending the Koran down from heaven was that mankind mightmake it a manual of morals, and not that they should recite it bysections.LXXXIVThe sincere publican has proceeded on foot; the slothful Pharisee ismounted and gone asleep.LXXXVThe sinner who humbles himself in prayer is more acceptable than thedevotee who is puffed up with pride:--The courteous and kind-heartedsoldier of fortune is better than the misanthropic and learned divine.LXXXVIA learned man without works is a bee without honey:--Tell that harsh andungenerous hornet: As thou yieldest no honey, wound not with thy sting.       *       *       *       *       *LXXXIXThough a dress presented by the sovereign be honorable, yet is our owntattered garment preferable; and though the viands at a great man'stable be delicate, yet is our own homely fare more sweet:--A salad andvinegar, the produce of our own industry, are sweeter than the lamb andbread sauce at the table of our village chief.XCIt is contrary to sound judgment, and repugnant to the maxims of theprudent, to take a medicine on conjecture, or to follow a road but inthe track of the caravan.XCIThey asked Imaam Mursheed Mohammed-bin-Mohammed Ghazali, on whom beGod's mercy, how he had reached such a pitch of knowledge. He replied:"Whatever I was ignorant of myself, I felt no shame in asking ofothers":--Thy prospect of health conforms with reason, when thy pulse isin charge of a skilled physician. Ask whatever thou knowest not; for thecondescension of inquiring is a guide on thy road in the excellence oflearning.XCIIAnything you foresee that you may somehow come to know, be not hasty inquestioning, lest your consequence and respectability may suffer:--WhenLucman perceived that in the hands of David iron was miraculouslymoulded like wax, he asked him not, How didst thou do it? for he wasaware that he should know it, through his own wisdom, without asking.XCIIIIt is one of the laws of good breeding that you should forego anengagement, or accommodate yourself to the master of theentertainment:--If thou knowest that the inclination is reciprocal,accommodate thy story to the temper of the hearer. Any discreet man thatwas in Mujnun's company would entertain him only with encomiums onLaila.       *       *       *       *       *XCVIWhoever interrupts the conversation of others to make a display of hisfund of knowledge makes notorious his own stock of ignorance.Philosophers have said:--A prudent man will not obtrude his answer tillhe has the question stated to him in form. Notwithstanding theproposition may have its right demonstration, the cavil of thefastidious will construe it wrong.       *       *       *       *       *XCVIIITo tell a falsehood is like the cut of a sabre; for though the wound mayheal, the scar of it will remain. In like manner as the brothers of theblessed Joseph, who, being notorious for a lie, had no credit afterwardswhen they spoke the truth:--God on high has said--Jacob is supposed tospeak--(Koran xii. Sale ii. 35):--"_Nay, but rather ye have contrivedthis to gratify your own passion; yet it behooves me to bepatient_":--If a man who is in the habit of speaking truth lets amistake escape him, we can overlook it; but if he be notorious foruttering falsehoods, and tell a truth, thou wilt call it a lie.XCIXThe noblest of creatures is man, and the vilest of animals is no doubt adog; yet, in the concurring opinion of the wise, a dog, thankful for hisfood, is more worthy than a human being who is void of gratitude:--A dogwill never forget the crumb thou gavest him, though thou may'stafterwards throw a hundred stones at his head; but foster with thykindness a low man for an age, and on the smallest provocation he willbe up against thee in arms.       *       *       *       *       *CIIt is written in the Injeel, or Gospel, stating: "O son of man, if Ibestow riches upon you, you will be more intent upon your property thanupon me, and if I leave you in poverty you will sit down dejected; howthen can you feel a relish to praise, or a zeal to worshipme?"--(Proverbs xxx. 7, 8, 9.) In the day of plenty thou art proud andnegligent; in the time of want, full of sorrow and dejected; since inprosperity and adversity such is thy condition, it were difficult tostate when thou wouldst voluntarily do thy duty.CIIThe pleasure of Him, or God, who has no equal hurls one man from athrone of sovereignty, and another he preserves in a fish'sbelly:--Happy proceeds his time who is enraptured with thy praise,though, like Jonah, he even may pass it in the belly of a fish!CIIIWere the Almighty to unsheath the sword of his wrath, prophets andpatriarchs would draw in their heads; and were he to deign a glimpse ofhis benevolence, it would reach the wicked along with the good:--Were heon the day of judgment to call us to a strict account, even the prophetswould have no room for excuse. Say, withdraw the veil from the face ofthy compassion, that sinners may entertain hopes of pardon.CIVWhoever is not to be brought into the path of righteousness by thepunishments of this life shall be overtaken with the punishments of thatto come:--"_Verily, I will cause them to taste the lesser punishmentover and above the greater punishment":_--(Koran xxxii. Sale ii. 258.)Princes, in chastising, admonish, and then confine; when they admonish,and thou listenest not, they throw thee into prison.CVMen of auspicious fortune would rather take warning from the preceptsand examples of their predecessors than that the rising generationshould take warning from their acts:--The bird will not approach thegrain that is spread about, where it sees another bird a captive in thesnare. Take warning by the mischance of others, that others may not takewarning by thine.CVIHow can he help himself who was born deaf, if he cannot hear; and whatcan he do whose thread of fortune is dragging him on that he may notproceed:--The dark night of such as are beloved of God is serene andlight as the bright day; but this good fortune results not from thineown strength of arm, till God in his mercy deign to bestow it. To whomshall I complain of thee? for there is no judge else, nor is any armmightier than thine. Him whom thou directest none can lead astray, andhim whom thou bewilderest none can direct upon his way.CVIIThe beggar whose end is good is better off than the king whose end isevil:--That sorrow which is the harbinger of joy is preferable to thejoy which is followed by sorrow.CVIIIThe sky enriches the earth with rain, and the earth gives it dust inreturn. As the Arabs say: "_What the vessels have, that they give_."--Ifmy moral character strike thee as improper, do not renounce thine owngood character.CIXThe Most High God discerns and hides what is improper; my neighbor seesnot, and is loud in his clamor:--God preserve us! if man knew what ishidden, none could be safe from the animadversion of his neighbor.CXGold is got from the mine by digging into the earth; and from the graspof the miser by taking away his life:--Misers spend not, but watch withsolicitude: expectation, they say, is preferable to waste. Next dayobserve to the joy of their enemies, the gold remains, and they are deadwithout the enjoyment of that hope.CXISuch as deal hard with the weak will suffer from the extortion of thestrong:--It is not every arm in which there is strength that can wrenchthe hand of a weak man. Bring not affliction upon the hearts of thefeeble, lest thou may'st fall under the lash of the strong.CXIIA wise man, where he meets opposition, labors to get through it, andwhere he finds quiet he drops his anchor, for there safety is on oneside, and here enjoyment in the middle of it.CXIIIThe gamester wants three sixes, but he throws only three aces:--Thepasture meadow is a thousand times richer than the common, but the horsehas not his tether at command.CXIVThe dervish in his prayer is saying: "O God, have compassion on thewicked, for to the good thou hast been abundantly kind, inasmuch as thouhast made them virtuous."CXVJemshid was the first person who put an edging round his garment, and aring upon his finger. They asked him: "Why did you bestow all thedecoration and ornament on the left hand, whilst the right is thesuperior?" He answered: "Sufficient for the right is the ornament ofbeing right." Feridun commanded the gilders of China that they wouldinscribe upon the front of his palace: "Strive, O wise man, to make thewicked good, for the good are of themselves great and fortunate."CXVIThey said to a great and holy man: "Notwithstanding the superiority thatthe right hand commands, who do they wear the ring on the left hand?" Hereplied: "Are you not aware that the best are most neglected! He whocasts our horoscope, provision, and fortune, bestows upon us either goodluck or wisdom."CXVIIIt is proper for him to offer counsel to kings who dreads not to losehis head, nor looks for a reward:--Whether thou strewest heaps of goldat his feet, or brandishest an Indian sword over the Unitarian's head,to hope or fear he is alike indifferent; and in this the divine unityalone he is resolved and firm.CXVIIIIt belongs to the king to displace extortioners, to the superintendentof the police to guard against murderers, and to the cazi to decide inquarrels and disputes. No two complainants ever referred to the cazicontent to abide by justice:--When thou knowest that in right the claimis just, better pay with a grace than by distress and force. If a man isrefractory in discharging his revenue, the collector must necessarilycoerce him to pay it.CXIXEvery man's teeth are blunted by acids excepting the cazi's, and theyrequire sweets:--That cazi, or judge, that can accept of five cucumbersas a bribe, will confirm thee in a right to ten fields of melons.       *       *       *       *       *CXXIThey asked a wise man, saying: "Of the many celebrated trees which theMost High God has created lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, orfree, excepting the cypress, which bears no fruit; what mystery is therein this?" He replied: "Each has its appropriate produce and appointedseason, during the continuance of which it is fresh and blooming, andduring their absence dry and withered; to neither of which states is thecypress exposed, being always flourishing; and of this nature are theazads, or religious independents. Fix not thy heart on what istransitory; for the Dijlah, or Tigris, will continue to flow throughBagdad after the race of Khalifs is extinct. If thy hand has plenty, beliberal as the date-tree; but if it affords nothing to give away, be anazad, or free man, like the cypress."CXXIITwo orders of mankind died, and carried with them regret: such as hadand did not spend, and such as knew and did not practise:--None can seethat wretched mortal a miser who will not endeavor to point out hisfaults; but were the generous man to have a hundred defects, hisliberality would cover all his blemishes.THE CONCLUSION OF THE BOOKThe book of the "Gulistan, or Flower-Garden," was completed through theassistance and grace of God. Throughout the whole of this work I havenot followed the custom of writers by inserting verses of poetryborrowed from former authors:--"It is more decorous to wear our ownpatched and old cloak than to ask in loan another man's garment."Most of Sa'di's sayings have a dash of hilarity and an odor of gayetyabout them, in consequence of which short-sighted critics extend thetongue of animadversion, saying: It is not the occupation of sensiblemen to solicit marrow from a shrivelled brain, or to digest the smoke ofa profitless lamp. Nevertheless it cannot be concealed from theenlightened judgment of the holy and good, to whom these discourses arespecially addressed, that the pearls of salutary admonition are threadedon the cord of an elegance of language, and the bitter potion ofinstruction sweetened with the honey of facetiousness, that the taste ofthe reader may not take disgust, and himself be debarred from thepleasure of approving of them: "On our part we offered some good advice,and spent an age in bringing it to perfection. If that should not meetthe ear of anybody's good-will, prophets deliver their messages, or warnmankind; and that is enough.""_O thou who perusest this book, ask the mercy of God on the author ofit: his forgiveness on the transcriber. Petition for whatever charitablegift thou mayst require for thyself, and implore pardon on the owner_."May I crave thy prayer on the English translator? _The book is finishedthrough the favor of the Lord God Paramount and the bestower of allgood_!***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PERSIAN LITERATURE, VOLUME 2,COMPRISING THE SHAH NAMEH, THE RUBAIYAT, THE DIVAN, AND THE GULISTAN********** This file should be named 13060.txt or 13060.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/0/6/13060Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

But at any rate I was going to try.At Zevenaar, while the Dutch customs officials were examining mybaggage, I patronised the youth selling apple cakes and coffee, forafter several months' absence from Germany my imagination had beenkindled to contemplate living uncomfortably on short rations forsome time as the least of my troubles.  Furthermore, the editorialopinion vouchsafed in the Dutch newspaper which I had bought atArnhem was that Austria's reply to the "Ancona" Note made a breakwith America almost a certainty.  Consequently as the train rolledover the few remaining miles to the frontier I crammed down myapple cakes, resolved to face the unknown on a full stomach.The wheels ground under the brakes, I pulled down the window with abang and looked out no longer upon the soft rolled military cap ofHolland but upon the business-like spiked helmet of Germany.  Isteeled myself.  There was no backing out now.  I had crossed theGerman frontier.The few passengers filed into the customs room, where a corps ofskilled mechanics prised open the contents of bags and trunks.Each man was an expert in his profession.  A hand plunged into oneof my bags and emerged with several bars of chocolate, the wrappersof which were shorn off before the chocolate was well out of thebag.  A bottle of liniment, the brand that made us forget oursprains and bruises in college days, was brought to light, and withcommendable dexterity the innocent label was removed in a twinklingwith a specially constructed piece of steel.  The label had apicture of a man with a very extensive moustache--the man who hadmade the liniment famous, or _vice versa_--but the trade name andproprietor must go unsung in the Fatherland, for the Government hasdecreed that travellers entering Germany may bring only threethings containing printed matter, viz.: railroad tickets, money andpassports.When the baggage squad had finished its task and replaced allunsuspected articles, the bags were sealed and sent on to await theowner, whose real troubles now began.I stepped into a small room where I was asked to hand over allprinted matter on my person.  Two reference books necessary for mywork were tried and found not guilty, after which they wereenclosed in a large envelope and sent through the regular censor.Switched into a third room before I had a chance even to bidgood-bye to the examiners in the second, I found myself standingbefore a small desk answering questions about myself and mybusiness asked tersely by an inquisitor who read from a lengthypaper which had to be filled in, and behind whom stood threeofficers in uniform.  These occasionally interpolated questions andalways glared into my very heart.  When I momentarily looked awayfrom their riveted eyes it was only to be held transfixed by thescrutinising orbs of a sharp, neatly dressed man who had been apassenger on the train.  He plays the double role ofdetective-interpreter, and he plays it in first-class fashion.While the man behind the desk was writing my biography, thedetective--or rather the interpreter, as I prefer to think of him,because he spoke such perfect English--cross-examined me in his ownway.  As the grilling went on I did not know whether to be anxiousabout the future or to glow with pride over the profound interestwhich the land of Goethe and Schiller was displaying in my life andliterary efforts.Had I not a letter from Count Bernstorff?I was not thus blessed.Did I not have a birth certificate?  Whom did I know in Germany?Where did they live?  On what occasions had I visited Germanyduring my past life?  On what fronts had I already seen fighting?What languages did I speak, and the degree of proficiency in each?Many of my answers to these and similar questions were carefullywritten down by the man at the desk, while his companions in theinquisition glared, always glared, and the room danced withsoldiers passing through it.At length my passport was folded and returned to me, but mycredentials and reference books were sealed in an envelope.  Theywould be returned to me later, I was told.I was shunted along into an adjoining small room where nimblefingers dexterously ran through my clothing to find out if I hadoverlooked declaring anything.Another shunting and I was in a large room.  I rubbed elbows withmore soldiers along the way, but nobody spoke.  Miraculously I cameto a halt before a huge desk, much as a bar of glowing iron, aftergliding like a living thing along the floor of a rolling mill,halts suddenly at the bidding of a distant hand.Behind the desk stood men in active service uniforms--men who hadundoubtedly faced death for the land which I was seeking to enter.They fired further questions at me and took down the data on mypassport, after which I wrote my signature for the official files.Attacks came hard and fast from the front and both flanks, while asilent soldier thumbed through a formidable card file, apparentlyto see if I were a _persona non grata_, or worse, in the records.I became conscious of a silent power to my left, and turning myglance momentarily from the rapid-fire questioners at the desk, Ilooked into a pair of lynx eyes flashing up and down my person.Another detective, with probably the added role of interpreter, butas I was answering all questions in German he said not a word.  Yethe looked volumes.Through more soldiers to the platform, and then a swift andcomparatively comfortable journey to Emmerich, accompanied by asoldier who carried my sealed envelope, the contents of which weresubsequently returned to me after an examination by the censor.At last I was alone! or rather I thought I was, for my innocentstroll about Emmerich was duly observed by a man who bore theunmistakable air of his profession, and who stepped into mycompartment on the Cologne train as I sat mopping my brow waitingfor it to start.  He flashed his badge of detective authority,asked to see my papers, returned them to me politely, and bowedhimself out.My journey was through the heart of industrial Germany, a heartwhich throbs feverishly night and day, month in and month out, todrive the Teuton power east, west, north, and south.Forests of lofty chimney-stacks in Wesel, Duisburg, Krefeld, Essen,Elberfeld and Dusseldorf belched smoke which hazed the landscapefar and wide: smoke which made cities, villages, lone brickfarmhouses, trees, and cattle appear blurred and indistinct, andwhich filtered into one's very clothing and into locked travellingbags.But there was a strength and virility about everything, from thevulcanic pounding and crashing in mills and arsenals to the sturdyuniformed women who were pushing heavy trucks along railroadplatforms or polishing railings and door knobs on the long lines ofcars in the train yards.Freight trains, military trains and passenger trains were speedingover the network of rails without a hitch, soldiers and officerswere crowding station platforms, and if there was any faltering ofvictory hopes among these men--as the atmosphere of the outsideworld may have at that time led one to believe--I utterly failed todetect it in their faces.  They were either doggedly anddeterminedly moving in the direction of duty, or going happily homefor a brief holiday respite, as an unmistakable brightness ofexpression, even when their faces were drawn from the strain of thetrenches, clearly showed.But it is the humming, beehive activity of theseRhenish-Westphalian cities and towns which crowd one another forspace that impresses the traveller in this workshop section ofGermany.  He knows that the sea of smoke, the clirr and crash ofcountless foundries are the impelling force behind Germany'ssoldier millions, whether they are holding far-thrown lines inRussia, or smashing through the Near East, or desperatelycounter-attacking in the West.In harmony with the scene the winter sun sank like a molten metalball behind the smoke-stack forest, to set blood-red an hour laterbeyond the zigzag lines in France.Maximilian Harden had just been widely reported as having said thatGermany's great military conquests were in no way due to planningin higher circles, but are the work of the rank and file---of theSchultzs and the Schmidts.  I liked to think of this as the trainsped on at the close of the short winter afternoon, for my firstbusiness was to call upon a middle-class family on behalf of aGerman-American in New York, who wished me to take 100 pounds tohis relatives in a small Rhenish town.Thus my first evening in Germany found me in a dark little town onthe Rhine groping my way through crooked streets to a home, thethreshold of which I no sooner crossed than I was made to feel thatthe arm of the police is long and that it stretches out into theremotest villages and hamlets.The following incident, which was exactly typical of what wouldhappen in nineteen German households out of twenty, may reveal onesmall aspect of German character to British and American people,who are as a rule completely unable to understand German psychology.Although I had come far out of my way to bring what was for them aconsiderable sum of money, as well as some portraits of theirlong-absent relatives in the United States and interesting familynews, my reception was as cold as the snow-blown air outside.  Iwas not allowed to finish explaining my business when I was atfirst petulantly and then violently and angrily interrupted with:--"Have you been to the police?""No," I said.  "I did not think it was necessary to go to thepolice, as I am merely passing through here, and am not going tostay."The lady of the house replied coldly, "Go to the police," and shutthe door in my face.I mastered my temper by reminding myself that whereas suchtreatment at home would have been sufficiently insulting to breakoff further relations, it was not intended as such in Germany.It was a long walk for a tired man to the _Polizeiamt_.  When I gotthere I was fortunate in encountering a lank, easy-going old fellowwho had been commandeered for the job owing to the departure of allthe local police for the war.  He was clearly more interested intrying to find out something of _his_ relations in some remotevillage in America, which he said was named after them, than in mybusiness.I returned to pay the 100 pounds and deliver the photographs, andnow that I had been officially "policed" was received with greatcordiality and pressed to spend the evening.Father, mother, grown-up daughters and brother-in-law all assuredme that it was not owing to my personal appearance that I had beenso coldly received, but that war is war and law is law and thateverything must be done as the authorities decree.Cigars and cigarettes were showered upon me and my glass was neverallowed to be empty of Rhine wine.  Good food was set before me andthe stock generously replenished whenever necessary.  It will beremembered that I had come unexpectedly and that I was not beingentertained in a wealthy home, and this at a time when the onlycounter-attack on Germany's success in the Balkans was an increasedamount of stories that she was starving.Evidently the Schultzs and the Schmidts were not taking all thecredit for Germany's position to themselves.  They pointed withpride to a picture of the Emperor adorning one wall and then smiledwith satisfaction as they indicated the portrait of von Hindenburgon the wall opposite.  One of the daughters wore a huge silvermedallion of the same renowned general on her neck.  After nearly ayear and a half of war these bard-working Germans were proud oftheir leaders and had absolute faith in them.But this family had felt the war.  One son had just been wounded,they knew not how severely, in France.  If some unknown English,soldier on the Yser had raised his rifle just a hairbreadth higherthe other son would be sleeping in the blood-soaked soil ofFlanders instead of doing garrison duty in Hanover while recoveringfrom a bullet which had passed through his head just under the eyes.CHAPTER IIWHEN SKIES WERE BLUEThere was one more passenger, making three, in our first-classcompartment in the all-day express train from Cologne to Berlinafter it left Hanover.  He was a naval officer of about forty-five,clean-cut, alert, clearly an intelligent man.  His manner wasproud, but not objectionably so.The same might be said of the manner of the major who had satopposite me since the train left Dusseldorf.  I had been in Germanyless than thirty hours and was feeling my way carefully, so I madeno attempt to enter into conversation.  Just before lunch thejolting of the train deposited the major's coat at my feet.  Ipicked it up and handed it to him.  He received it with thanks anda trace of a smile.  He was polite, but icily so.  I was anAmerican, he was a German officer.  In his way of reasoning mycountry was unneutrally making ammunition to kill himself and hismen.  But for my country the war would have been over long ago.Therefore he hated me, but his training made him polite in hishate.  That is the difference between the better class of army andnaval officers and diplomats and the rest of the Germans.When he left the compartment for the dining-car he saluted andbowed stiffly.  When we met in the narrow corridor after our returnfrom lunch, each stepped aside to let the other pass in first.  Iexchanged with him heel-click for heel-click, salute for salute,waist-bow for waist-bow, and after-you-my-dear-Alphonse sweep ofthe arm for you-go-first-my-dear-Gaston motion from him.  Theresult was that we both started at once, collided, backed away andindulged in all the protestations and gymnastics necessary to beganother's pardon, in military Germany.  At length we entered,erected a screen of ice between us, and alternately looked from oneanother to the scenery hour after hour.The entrance of the naval officer relieved the strain, for the twobranches of the Kaisers armed might were soon--after the usualgymnastics--engaged in conversation.  They were not men to discusstheir business before a stranger.  Once I caught the wordAmerikaner uttered in a low voice, but though their looks told thatthey regarded me as an intruder in their country they said nothingon that point.At Stendal we got the Berlin evening papers, which had little ofinterest except a few lines about the _Ancona_ affair betweenWashington and Vienna."Do you think Austria will grant the American demands?" the man ingrey asked the man in blue."Austria will do what Germany thinks best.  Personally, I hope thatwe take a firm stand.  I do not believe in letting the UnitedStates tell us how to conduct the war.  We are quite capable ofconducting it and completing it in a manner satisfactory toourselves."The man in grey agreed with the man in blue.Past the blazing munition works at Spandau, across the Havel,through the Tiergarten, running slowly now, to the_Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof_.A bewildering swirl of thoughts rushed through my head as I steppedout on the platform.  More than three months ago I had left Londonfor my long, circuitous journey to Berlin.  I had planned andfeared, planned and hoped.  The German spy system is the mostelaborate in the world.  Only through a miracle could theWilhelmstrasse be ignorant of the fact that I had travelled allover Europe during the war for the hated British Press.  I couldonly hope that the age of miracles had not passed.The crowd was great, porters were as scarce as they used to beplentiful, I was waiting for somebody, so I stood still and tooknote of my surroundings.Across the platform was a long train ready to start west, and fromeach window leaned officers and soldiers bidding good-bye to groupsof friends.  The train was marked _Hannover_, _Koln_, _Lille_.  Asthough I had never known it before, I found myself saying, "Lilleis in France, and those men ride there straight from here."The train on which I had arrived had pulled out and another hadtaken its place.  This was marked _Posen_, _Thorn_, _Insterburg_,_Stalluponen_, _Alexandrovo_, _Vilna_.  As I stood on that platformI felt Germany's power in a peculiar but convincing way.  I hadbeen in Germany, in East Prussia, when the Russians were not onlyin possession of the last four places named, but about to threatenthe first two.Now the simple printed list of stations on the heavy train about tostart from the capital of Germany to Vilna, deep in Russia, was anawe-inspiring tribute to the great military machine of theFatherland.  For a moment I believed in von Bethmann-Holweg's talkabout the "map of Europe."I was eager to see how much Berlin had changed, for I knew it atvarious stages of the war, but I cannot honestly say that thechanges which I detected later, and which I shall deal with insubsequent chapters of this book--changes which are absorbinglyinteresting to study on the spot and vitally important in theprogress and outcome of the war--were very apparent then.In the dying days of 1915 I found the people of Berlin almost assupremely confident of victory, especially now since Bulgaria'sentrance had made such sweeping changes in the Balkans, as theywere on that day of cloudless blue, the first of August, 1914, whenthe dense mass swayed before the Royal Palace, to see William IIcome out upon the balcony to bid his people rise to arms.  Eyessparkled, cheeks flushed, the buzz changed to cheering, thecheering swelled to a roar.  The army which had been brought to thehighest perfection, the army which would sweep Europe--at last theGerman people could see what it would do, would show the world whatit would do.  The anticipation intoxicated them.An American friend told me of how he struggled toward the_Schloss_, but in the jam of humanity got only as far as themonument of Frederick the Great.  There a youth threw his hat inthe air and cried: "_Hock der Krieg, Hock der Krieg_!" (Hurrah forthe war).That was the spirit that raged like a prairie fire.An old man next to him looked him full in the eyes.  "_Der Kriegist eine ernste Sache, Junge_!" (War is a serious matter, youngman), he said and turned away.  He was in the crowd, but not of it.His note was discordant.  They snarled at him and pushed himroughly.  They gloried in the thought of war.  They were certainthat they were invincible.  All that they bad been taught, all theinfluences on their lives convinced them that nothing could standbefore the _furor teutonicus_ once it was turned loose.Delirious days when military bands blared regiment after regimentthrough lines of cheering thousands; whole companies deluged withflowers, long military trains festooned with blossoms and greeneryrolling with clock-like regularity from the stations amidthunderous cheers.  Sad partings were almost unknown, for, ofcourse, no earthly power could withstand the onslaughts of theKaiser's troops.  God was with them--even their belts and helmetsshowed that.  So, "Good-bye for six weeks!"The 2nd of September is Sedan Day, and in 1914 it was celebrated asnever before.  A great parade was scheduled, a parade which wouldshow German prowess.  Though I arrived in "Unter den Linden" twohours before the procession was due, I could not get anywhere nearthe broad central avenue down which it would pass.  I chartered ataxi which had foundered in the throng, and perched on top.  TheGovernment, always attentive to the patriotic education of thechildren, had given special orders for such occasions.  The littleones were brought to the front by the police, and boys were evenpermitted to climb the sacred Linden trees that they might bettersee what the Fatherland had done.The triumphal column entered through the Kaiser Arch of theBrandenburger Tor, and bedlam broke loose during the passing of thecaptured cannon of Russia, France, and Belgium--these last cast byGerman workmen at Essen and fired by Belgian artillerists againstGerman soldiers at Liege.The gates of Paris!  Then the clear-cut German official reportsbecame vague for a few days about the West, but had much ofHindenburg and victory in the East.  Democracies wash their dirtylinen in public, while absolute governments tuck theirs out ofsight, where it usually disappears, but sometimes unexpectedlydevelops spontaneous combustion.Nobody--outside of the little circle--questioned the delay inentering Paris.  Everything was going according to plan, was thesaying.  I suppose sheep entertain a somewhat similar attitude whentheir leader conducts them over a precipice.  Antwerp must be takenfirst--that was the key to Paris and London.  Such was the gossipwhen the scene was once more set in Belgium, and the great Skodamortars pulverised forts which on paper were impregnable.  Many atime during the first days of October I left my glass of beer orcup of tea half finished and rushed from cafe and restaurant withthe crowd to see if the newspaper criers of headlines wereannouncing the fall of the fortress on the Scheldt, How thosepeople discussed the terms of the coming early peace, terms whichwere not by any means easy!  Berlin certainly had its thumbs turneddown on the rest of Europe.With two other Americans I sat with a group of prosperous Berlinersin their luxurious club.  Waiters moved noiselessly over costlyrugs and glasses clinked, while these men seriously discussed theprobable terms Germany would soon impose on a conquered continent.Belgium would, of course, be incorporated into the German Empire,and Antwerp would be the chief outlet for Germany's commerce--andhow that commerce would soon boom at the expense of Great Britain!France would now have an opportunity to develop her socialisticexperiments, as she would be permitted to maintain only a verysmall army.  The mistake of 1870 must not be repeated.  This timethere would be no paltry levy of five billion francs.  A greatGerman Empire would rise on the ruins of the British.  Commercialgain was the theme.  I did not gather from the conversation thatanybody but Germany would be a party to the peace.A man in close touch with things military entered at midnight.  Hiseyes danced as he gave us new information about Antwerp.   Clearlythe city was doomed.I did not sleep that night.  I packed.  Next evening I was inHolland.  I saw a big story, hired a car, picked up a _Times_courier, and, after "fixing" things with the Dutch guards, dashedfor Antwerp.  The long story of a retreat with the rearguard of theBelgian Army has no place here.  But there were scenes whichcontrasted with the boasting, confident, joyous capital I had left.Belgian horses drawing dejected families, weeping on theirhousehold goods, other families with everything they had savedbundled in a tablecloth or a handkerchief.  Some had theirbelongings tied on a bicycle, others trundled wheel-barrows.Valuable draught dogs, harnessed, but drawing no cart, were led bytheir masters, while other dogs that nobody thought of justfollowed along.  And tear-drenched faces everywhere.  Back inBergen-op-Zoom and Putten I had seen chalk writing on brick wallssaying that members of certain families had gone that way and wouldwait in certain designated places for other members who chanced topass.  On the road, now dark, and fringed with pines, I saw a faintlight flicker.  A group passed, four very old women tottering aftera very old man, he holding a candle before him to light the way.As I jotted down these things and handed them to my courier Ithought of the happy faces back in Berlin, of jubilant crowdsdashing from restaurants and cafes as each newspaper edition wasshouted out, and I knew that the men in the luxurious club werefiguring out to what extent they could mulct Belgium.I pressed on in the dark and joined the Belgian army and theBritish Naval Brigade falling back before the Germans.  I came uponan American, now captain of a Belgian company.  "It's a damn shame,and I hate to admit it," he said, "but the Allies are done for."That is the way it looked to us in the black hours of the retreat.Soldiers were walking in their sleep.  Some sank, too exhausted tocontinue.  An English sailor, a tireless young giant, trudged onmile after mile with a Belgian soldier on his back.  Both theBelgian's feet had been shot off and tightly bound handkerchiefsfailed to check the crimson trail.London and Paris were gloomy, but Berlin was basking in the brightmorning sunshine of the war.Although the fronts were locked during the winter, the Germanauthorities had good reason to feel optimistic about the comingspring campaign.  They knew that they had increased their munitionoutput enormously, and their spies told them that Russia hadpractically run out of ammunition, while England had not yetawakened to the realisation that this is a war of shells.The public saw the result in the spring.  The armies of the Tsarfell back all along the line, while in Germany the flags werewaving and the bells of victory were pealing.All through this there was unity in Germany, a unity that theGermans felt and gloried in.  "No other nation acts as one man inthis wonderful time as do we Germans," they told the stranger againand again.  Unity and Germany became synonymous in my mind.Love of country and bitterness against the enemy are intensified ina nation going to war.  It is something more than this, however,which has imbued and sustained the flaming spirit of Germany duringthis war.  In July, 1914, the Government deliberately set out toovercome two great forces.  The first was the growing section ofher anti-militaristic citizens, and the second was the combinationof Great Powers which she made up her mind she must fight sooner orlater if she would gain that place in the sun which had dazzled herso long.Her success against the opposition within her was phenomenal.Germany was defending herself against treacherous attack--that wasthe watchword.  The Social Democrats climbed upon the band-waggonalong with the rest for the joy-ride to victory, and they remainedon the band-waggon for more than a year--then some of them droppedoff.The story of how all Germans were made to think as one man is astory of one of the greatest phenomena of history.  It is mypurpose in the next few chapters to show how the German Governmentcreates unity.  Then, in later chapters, I will describe the forcestending to disintegrate that wonderful unity.Germany entered the war with the Government in control of all theforces affecting public opinion.  The only way in which newspapereditors, reporters, lecturers, professors, teachers, theatremanagers, and pulpit preachers could hope to accomplish, anythingin the world was to do something to please the Government.  Todisplease the Government meant to be silenced or to experiencesomething worse.CHAPTER IIITHE CRIME AGAINST THE CHILDRENThe boys and girls of Germany play an important part in _die grosseZeit_ (this great wartime).  Every atom of energy that can bedragged out of the children has been put to practical purpose.Their little souls, cursed by "incubated hate," have been so workedupon by the State schoolmasters that they have redoubled theirenergies in the tasks imposed upon them of collecting gold, copper,nickel, brass, paper, acorns, blackberries, blueberries, rubber,woollen and war loan money.All this summer on release from school, which commences at sevenand closes at three in most parts of Germany, the hours varying insome districts, the children, in organised squads, have been put tothese important purposes of State.  They had much to do with thegetting in of the harvest.The schoolmaster has played his part in the training of the childto militarism, State worship, and enemy hatred as effectively asthe professor and the clergyman.Here are two German children's school songs, that are being sungdaily.  Both of them are creations of the war: both written byschoolmasters.  The particularly offensive song about King Edwardand England is principally sung by girls--the future mothers ofGermany:--  O England, O England,  Wie gross sind Deine Lugen!  Ist Dein Verbrechen noch so gross,  Du schwindelst Dich vom Galgen los.  O Eduard, O Eduard, du Muster aller Fursten,  Nichts hattest Du von einem Rex,  Du eitler Schlips--und Westenfex.[Oh, England, oh, England, how great are thy lies!  However greatthy crimes, thou cheatest the gallows.  Oh, Edward, oh, Edward,thou model Prince!  Thou hadst nothing kindly in thee, thou vainfop!]  Da druben, da druben liegt der Feind,  In feigen Schutzengraben,  Wir greifen ihn an, und ein Hund, wer meint,  Heut' wurde Pardon gegeben.  Schlagt alles tot, was um Gnade fleht,  Schiesst alles nieder wie Hunde,  Mehr Feinde, mehr Feinde! sei euer Gebet  In dieser Vergeltungsstunde.[Over there in the cowardly trenches lies the enemy.  We attackhim, and only a dog will say that pardon should be given to-day.Strike dead everything which prays for mercy.  Shoot everythingdown like dogs.  "More enemies, more enemies," be your prayer inthis hour of retribution.]The elementary schools, or _Volksschulen_, are free, and attendanceis compulsory from six to fourteen.  There are some 61,000 freepublic elementary schools with over 10,000,000 pupils, and over 600private elementary schools, with 42,000 pupils who pay fees.Germany is a land of civil service; to enter which a certificatefrom a secondary school is necessary.  Some authorities maintainthat the only way to prevent being flooded with candidates is tomake the examinations crushingly severe.  Children are early madeto realise that all hope of succeeding in life rests upon thepassing of these examinations.  Thus the despair which often leadsto suicide on the one hand and knowledge without keenness on theother.Hardly any class has suffered more heavily in the war than themasters of the State schools, which are equivalent to EnglishCouncil schools and American public schools.   The thinning oftheir ranks is an eloquent proof of the heaviness of the Germandeath toll.  Their places have been taken by elderly men, butprincipally by women.  It is a kind of Nemesis that they shouldhave fallen in the very cause they have been propagating for atleast a generation.Those who knew only the old and pleasant Germany do not realise thespeeding up of the hate machine that has taken place in the lastdecade.  The protests against this State creation of hate grow lessand less as the war proceeds.  To-day only comparatively fewmembers of the Social-Democrat Party raise objection to thishorrible contamination of the minds of the coming generation ofGerman men and women.  Not much reflection is needed to see on whatfruitful soil the great National Liberal Party, with its backing ofcapitalists, greedy merchants, chemists, bankers, ship and mineowners, is planting its seeds for the future.  There is no cure forthis evil state of affairs, but the practical proof, inflicted bybig cannon, that the world will not tolerate a nation of which thevery children are trained to hate the rest of the world, and taughtthat German _Kultur_ must be spread by bloodshed and terror.With the change in Germany has come a change in the family life.The good influence of some churches has gone completely.  They arepart of the great war machine.  The position of the mother is notwhat it was.  The old German Hausfrau of the three K's, which Iwill roughly translate by "Kids, Kitchen, and Kirk," has becomeeven more a servant of the master of the house than she was.  TheState has taken control of the souls of her children, and she hasnot even that authority that she had twenty years ago.  The fatherhas become even more important than of yore.  The natural tendencyof a nation of which almost every man is a soldier, is to elevatethe man at the expense of the woman, and the German woman has takento her new position very readily.  She plays her wonderful part inthe production of munitions, not as in Britain in a spirit ofequality, but with a sort of admitted inferiority difficult todescribe exactly.At four years of age the German male child begins to be a soldier.At six he is accustomed to walk in military formation.  This systemhas a few advantages, but many disadvantages.  A great concourse ofinfants can, for example, be marshalled through the streets of acity without any trouble at all.  But that useful discipline ismore than counterbalanced by the killing of individuality.  Germanchildren, especially during the war, try to grow up to be littlemen and women as quickly as possible.  They have shared the longworking hours of the grown-ups, and late in the hot summer nights Ihave seen little Bavarian boys and girls who have been at schoolfrom seven and worked in the fields from three o'clock till dark,drinking their beer in the beer garden with a relish that showedthey needed some stimulant.  The beer is not Bass's ale, but itcontains from two to five per cent. of alcohol.  Unhealthy-lookinglittle men are these German boys of from twelve to fifteen duringthe war.  The overwork, and the lowering of the diet, has giventhem pasty faces and dark rings round their eyes.  All games andamusements have been abandoned, and the only relaxation is corpsmarching through the streets at night, singing their hate songs and"Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles."The girls, in like fashion, often spend their school interval inmarching in columns of four, singing the same horrible chants.Up to the time of the scarcity of woollen materials, the millionsof little German schoolgirls produced their full output of comfortsfor the troops.The practical result, from a military point of view, of trainingchildren to venerate the All-Highest War Lord and his family,together with his ancestors, was shown at the beginning of the war,when there came a great rush of volunteers (_Freiwillige_), many ofthem beneath the military age, many of them beyond it.  In most ofthe calculations of German man-power, some ally and neutralmilitary writers seem to have forgotten these volunteers, estimatedat two millions.A significant change in Germany is the cessation of the volunteermovement.  Parents who gladly sent forth their boys as volunteers,are now endeavouring by every means in their power to postpone theevil day in the firm belief that peace will come before the age ofmilitary service has been reached.  It is a change at least assignificant as that which, lies between the German's "We havewon--the more enemies the better" of two years back, and the "Wemust hold out" of to-day.Of the school structures in modern Germany it would be idle topretend that they are not excellent in every respect--perfectventilation, sanitation, plenty of space, large numbers ofclass-rooms, and halls for the choral singing, which is part of theGerman system of education, and by which the "hate" songs have beenso readily spread.  The same halls are used for evening lecturesfor adults and night improvement schools.It is significant that all the schools built between 1911 and 1914were so arranged, not only in Germany, but throughout Austria, thatthey could be turned into hospitals with hardly any alteration.For this purpose, temporary partitions divided portions of thebuildings, and an unusually large supply of water was laid on.Special entrances for ambulances were already in existence, bathshad already been fitted in the wounded reception rooms, and in manycases sterilising sheds were already installed.  The walls weremade of a material that could he quickly whitewashed for theextermination of germs.  If this obvious preparation for war isnamed to the average German, his reply is, "The growing jealousy ofGerman culture and commerce throughout the world rendered necessaryprotective measures."A total lack of sense of humour and sense of proportion among theGermans can be gathered from the fact that Mr. Haselden's famouscartoons of Big and Little Willie, which have a vogue amongAmericana and other neutrals in Germany, and are by no meansunkind, are regarded by Germans as a sort of sacrilege.  These samepeople do not hesitate to circulate the most horrible and indecentpictures of President Wilson, King George, President Poincare, andespecially of Viscount Grey of Falloden.  The Tsar is usuallydepicted covered with vermin.  The King of Italy as an evil-lookingdwarf with a dagger in his hand.  Only those who have seen thevirulence of the caricatures, circulated by picture postcard, canhave any idea of the horrible material on which the German child isfed.  The only protest I ever heard came from the Artists' Societyof Munich, who objected to these loathsome educational efforts asbeing injurious to the reputation of artistic Germany andcalculated to produce permanent damage to the juvenile mind.The atmosphere of the German home is so different from that inwhich I have been brought up in the United States, and have seen inEngland, that the Germans are not at all shocked by topics ofconversation never referred to in other countries.  Subjects arediscussed before German girls of eleven and twelve, and German boysof the same age, that make an Anglo-Saxon anxious to get out of theroom.  I do not know whether it is this or the over-education thatleads to the notorious child suicides of Germany, upon which somany learned treatises have been written.Just before the war it looked as though the German young man andwoman were going to improve.  Lawn tennis was spreading, despiteold-fashioned prejudice.  Football was coming in.  Rowing wasmaking some progress, as you may have learned at Henley.  It wasnot the spontaneous sport of Anglo-Saxon countries, but a moreconcentrated effort to imitate and to excel.Running races had become lately a German school amusement, but theresults, as a rule, were that if there were five competitors, thefour losers entered a protest against the winner.  In any case,each of the four produced excellent excuses why he had lost, otherthan the fact that he had been properly beaten.A learned American "exchange professor," who had returned from aGerman university, whom I met in Boston last year on my way fromEngland to Germany, truly summed up the situation of athletics inGerman schools by saying, "German boys are bad-tempered losers andboastful winners."Upon what kinds of history is the German child being brought up?The basis of it is the history of the House of Hohenzollern, withvolumes devoted to the Danish and Austrian campaigns and minutedescriptions of every phase of all the battles with France in 1870,written in a curious hysterical fashion.The admixture of Biblical references and German boasting aretypical of the lessons taught at German Sunday Schools, which playa great role in war propaganda.  The schoolmaster having done hiswork for six days of the week, the pastor gives an extra virulentdose on the Sabbath.  Sedan Day, which before the war was theculmination of hate lessons, often formed the occasion of SundaySchool picnics, at which the children sang new anti-French songs.There are some traits in German children most likeable.  There are,for example, the respect for, and courtesy and kindness towards,anybody older than themselves.   There are admiration for learningand ambition to excel in any particular task.  There is a genuinelove of music.  On the other hand, there is much dishonesty, as maybe witnessed by the proceedings in the German police courts, andhas been proved in the gold and other collections.The elimination of real religion in the education of children andthe substitution of worship of the State is, in the minds of manyimpartial observers, something approaching a national catastrophe.In any other community it would probably be accompanied by anarchy.It certainly has swelled the calendar of German crime.  Germanstatistics prove that every sort of horror has been greatly on theincrease in the last quarter of a century.I went to Germany the first time under the impression that theAnglo-Saxon had much to learn from German education.  I do notthink that any observer in Germany itself to-day would findanything valuable to learn in the field of education, except whenthe German student comes to the time he takes up scientificresearch, to which the German mind, with its intense industry andregard for detail, is so eminently suited.  The German Governmentgives these young students every advantage.  They are not, as withus, obliged to start money-making as soon as they leave school.  Asa rule a German boy's career is marked out for him by his parentsand the schoolmaster at a very early age.  If he is to follow outany one of the thousand branches of chemical research dealing withcoal-tar products, for example, he knows his fate at fourteen orfifteen, and his eye is rarely averted from his goal until he hasachieved knowledge and experience likely to help him in the greatGerman trade success which has followed their utilisation ofapplied science.CHAPTER IVPULPITS OF HATEThe unpleasant part played by the clergy, and especially theLutheran pastors, needs to be explained to those who regard clericsas necessarily men of peace.The claim that the Almighty is on the side of Germany is not a newone.  It was made as far back as the time of Frederick the Great.It was advanced in the war of 1870.  It found strong voice at thetime of the Boer War, when the pastors issued a united manifestovirulently attacking Great Britain.These pastors are in communication with the German-AmericanLutherans in the United States, who exerted their influence to theutmost against the election of President Wilson, taking theirinstructions indirectly from the German Foreign Office.The state of affairs in the German churches is so different fromanything on the other side of the Atlantic, and in Great Britain,that it is almost as difficult to make people in England understandwar-preaching ministers as it is to make them comprehendwar-teaching schoolmasters.My description of the poisoning by hate songs of the child mind ofGermany at its most impressionable age came as a shock to many ofmy readers.  But the hate songs of the children are not as fierceas the hate hymns and prayers of the pastors.  Do the public hererealise that of the original Zeppelin fund hundreds of thousands ofmarks were subscribed in churches and chapels, and that models ofZeppelins have formed portions of church decorations at festivals?The pastors of the Prussian State Church are in one importantrespect the exact opposite of Martin Luther.  He was thoroughlyindependent in spirit and rebelled against authority; they areabjectly submissive to it.  As with the professor, so with thepastor, it is no mere accident that he is a puppet-tool of theState.  The German Government leaves nothing to chance, andrealising to the fullest the importance of docile and unifiedsubjects both for interior rule and exterior conquest, itdeliberately and artfully regulates those who create public opinion.There are some Lutheran pastors in Germany who work for an ideal,who detest the propagation of hate.  Why, one may naturally ask, dothey not cry out against such a pernicious practice?  They cannot,for they are muzzled.  When a pastor enters this Church of whichthe Supreme War Lord is the head, his first oath is unqualifiedallegiance to his King and State.  If he keeps his oath he canpreach no reform, for the State, being a perfect institution, canhave no flaw.  If he breaks his oath, which happens when he raiseshis voice in the slightest criticism, he is silenced.  This meansthat he must seek other means of earning a livelihood--a thingalmost impossible in a land where training casts a man in a rigidmould.  Thus these parsons have their choice between going onquietly with their work and being nonentities in the public eye orbespattering the non-Germanic section of the world with the mire ofhate.  I regret to say that most of them choose the latter course.While I was in Germany I read a lengthy and solicitous letter fromPastor Winter, of Bruch, addressed to Admiral von Tirpitz, who hadjust retired for the ostensible reason that he was unwell, butwhose illness was patently only diplomatic.  The good pastorexpressed the hope that his early recovery would permit the admiralto continue his noble work of obliterating England.  Pastor Falk,of Berlin, is a typical fire-eater.  His Whitsuntide address was anattack upon Anglo-Saxon civilisation and the urgent German missionof smashing Britain and America.  The Easter sermons of hate, oneof which I heard at Stettin, were especially bloodthirsty.Congregations are larger than usual on that day, which is intendedto commemorate a spirit quite the opposite to hate.  The clergy areinstructed not to attack Prance or Russia, and so it comes aboutthat, as I have previously pointed out, in Prussia, Hanover,Schleswig-Holstein, Brandenburg, and Saxony, the pastors of theState Church preach hatred of Britain, as violently in theirpulpits as in their pastoral visits.The pulpit orators, taking their tip from the Government, are alsoexhorting their congregations to "hold out and win the war."  Iknow of one pastor in a good section of Berlin, however, who hasrecently lost considerable influence in his congregation.  Sundayafter Sunday his text has been, "Wir mussen durchhalten!" (We musthold out!)  "No sacrifice should be too great for the Fatherland,no privation, too arduous to be endured if one but has the spiritto conquer."  He paid particular attention to the rapidlyincreasing number of people who grumble incessantly over theshortage of food.  The good man was clearly losing patience withthose who complained.One day thieves broke into his home and got away with an enormousamount of hams and other edibles.  I remind the reader that ham hadere this become unknown in Berlin.  Less than three hundred pigswere being killed there per week where formerly twenty-fivethousand were slaughtered.  The Government had more-over taken ahouse-to-house inventory of food, and hoarding had been madepunishable by law.The story, of course, never appeared in the papers, since suchdivines are useful implements of the State, but the wholecongregation heard of it, with the disastrous consequence that thegood man's future sermons on self-denial fell upon stony ground.One dear old lady, a widow, whose two sons had fallen in the war,told me that she had not gone to church for years, but after hersecond son fell she sought spiritual comfort in attending servicesevery Sunday.  "I am so lonesome now," she said, "and somehow Ifeel that when I hear the word of God I shall be nearer to my boys."I met her some weeks later on her way home from church.  "It is nouse," she sighed, shaking her head sadly, "the church does notsatisfy the longing in my heart.  It is not for such as me.Nothing but war, war, war, and hate, hate, hate!"The German Navy League, an aggressive body which had gatheredaround it more than a million members previous to the war, stirredup anti-British feeling by means of leaflets, newspaper articles,kinematograph exhibitions, and sermons.  Among the bitterest of thepreachers are returned missionaries from British possessions.Although the social position of the pastor in a German village isless than that of a minor Government official, yet he and his wifewield considerable influence.  The leading pastors receive eachweek many of the Government propaganda documents, including adigest carefully prepared for them by the foreign Press Department.I obtained some copies of this weekly digest, but was unable tobring them out of Germany.  What purport to be extracts from theLondon newspapers are ingenious distortions.  Sometimes a portionof an article is reprinted with the omission of the context, thusentirely altering its meaning.  The recipients of this carefullyprepared sheet believe implicitly in its authenticity.  Any chanceremark of a political nobody in the House of Commons that seemsfavourable to Germany is quoted extensively.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald,in the eyes of the German village clergyman, ranks as one of themost important men in the British Empire.  Mr. Stanton, M.P., intheir view, is a low hireling of the British Government, doingdirty work in the hope of getting political preferment.  The_Labour Leader_, which I have not seen in any house or hotel or onany newspaper stall, is, according to this digest, one of theleading English newspapers, and almost the only truth-telling organof the Allies.These people really believe this.  When home-staying Englishmentalk to me about the German War party, I find it difficult toexplain to them that the German War party is practically the wholecountry.One or two better-travelled and better-educated pastors haveexpressed mild regret at the bloodthirsty attitude of theirbrethren in private conversation.  But I never heard of one who hadthe courage to "speak out in open meeting."The modern, material Germany has not much use for religion exceptas a factor in government.  The notorious spread of extremeagnosticism in the last quarter of a century renders it essentialfor the clergy to hold their places by stooping to the violence ofthe Professors.  Mixed with their attitude of hostility to Britainis a considerable amount of professional jealousy and envy.  Anumber of German pastors paid a visit to London some two or threeyears before the outbreak of war, and I happened to meet one ofthem recently in Germany.  So far from being impressed by what hehad seen there, he had come to the conclusion that the Englishclergy, and especially the Nonconformists, were an overpaid, andundisciplined body, with no other aim than their personal comfort.He had visited Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's, Spurgeon'sTabernacle, the City Temple, and had studied--so he toldme--English Wesleyanism and, Congregationalism in severalprovincial centres.  He was particularly bitter about oneNonconformist who had accepted a large salary to go to the UnitedStates.  He returned to Germany impressed with the idea that theNonconformist and State Churches alike were a body of sycophants,sharing the general decadent state of the English.  What struck himprincipally was what he referred to continually as the lack ofdiscipline and uniformity.  Each man seemed to take his own pointof view, without any regard to the opinions of the particularreligious denomination to which he belonged.  All were grosslyignorant of science and chemistry, and all were very much overpaid.Here, I think, lay the sting of his envy, and it is part of thegeneral jealousy of England, a country where everybody is supposedto be underworked and overpaid.The only worse country in this respect from the German point ofview is the United States, "where even the American Lutheranpastors have fallen victims to the lust for money."  The particularLutheran of whom I am speaking had been the guest of an EnglishNonconformist minister and his wife, who had evidently tried to beas hospitable as possible, and had no doubt put themselves out totake him for excursions and outings in the Shakespeare country."It was nothing but eating and drinking and sightseeing," remarkedthe Herr Pastor.I suggested that he was a guest, to be looked after."I can assure you," he replied, "that Mr. ------ had nothing to doall day but read the newspapers, and drink tea with hiscongregation.  He did not take the trouble to grow his ownvegetables, and all he had to do was to preach on Sundays andattend a very unruly Sunday school.  His wife, too, was not dressedas one of ours."He explained to me that his own life was very different.  He ekedout his minute salary by a small scientifically managed farm, and Igathered the impression that he was much more of a farmer than apastor, for he deplored his inability to obtain imported nitratesowing to the blockade.  The only question on which he was at allunorthodox was that of the Junkers and their regrettable power ofholding potatoes, pigs, and other supplies while small men like himhad been obliged to sell.  He had a good collection of modernscientific agricultural works, of which the Germans have anabundance.But while admiring the energy of the great capitalists and therational Liberal Party, the average clergyman tends towardssympathy with the Agrarians.  The pastor of the small towns andvillages, who is very much under the thumb of the local Junker orrich manufacturer, has as his highest ambition the hope that he andhis wife may be invited to coffee at least twice a year.  Thepastor's wife is delighted to be condescendingly received by thegreat lady.  Herr Pastor talks agriculture with Herr Baron, andFrau Pastor discusses past and coming incidents in the local birthrate with Frau Baron.  Snobbery has no greater exemplification thanin the relations of the local Lutheran pastor and the locallandlord or millionaire.A sidelight on German mentality is contained in a littleconversation which I had with a clergyman in the Province of Posen.He knew England well, by residence and by matrimonial connections.This is how he explained the battle of the Somme.  I give his ownwords:--"Many wounded men are coming back to our Church from the dreadfulWestern front.  They have been fighting the British, and they findthat so ignorant are the British of warfare that the Britishsoldiers on the Somme refuse to surrender, not knowing that theyare really beaten, with the result that terrible losses areinflicted upon our brave troops."In this exact report of a conversation is summed up a great deal ofGerman psychology.For the Salvation Army a number of Germans have genuine respect,because it seems to be organised on some military basis.  TheChurch of England they consider as degenerate as the Nonconformist.Both, they think, are mere refuges for money-making ecclesiastics.CHAPTER VPUPPET PROFESSORSThe professor, like the army officer, has long been a semi-deity inGermany.  Not only in his university lectures does he influence thestudents, and particularly the prospective teachers of secondaryschools who hang on his words, but he writes the bulk of thehistorical, economic and political literature of the daily Press,the magazines and the tons of pamphlets which flood the country.Years before the war the Government corralled him for its own.  Itgave him social status, in return for which he would do his part tomake the citizen an unquestioning, faithful and obedient servant ofthe State.  As soon as he enters on his duties he becomes a civilservant, since the universities are State institutions.  He takesan oath in which it is stipulated that he will not write or preachor do anything questioning the ways of the State.  His only way tomake progress in life, then, is to serve the State, to preach whatit wishes preached, to teach history as it wishes history taught.The history of Prussia is the history of the House of Hohenzollern,and the members of the House, generation after generation, must allbe portrayed a& heroes.  There was a striking illustration of thisin 1913 when the Kaiser had Hauptmann's historical play suppressedbecause it represented Frederick William III. in true light, asputty in the hands of Napoleon.There is a small group of German professors interested solely inscientific research, such as Professor Roentgen and the lateProfessor Ehrlich, which we exclude from the "puppet professors."Such men succeed through sheer ability and their results are theirdiplomas before the world.  Neither shoulder-knots nor medalspinned in rows across their breasts would contribute one iota totheir success, nor make that success the more glittering once it isachieved.One of these, a Bavarian of the old school, a thoughtful, liberalman who had travelled widely, told me that he deplored the depthsof mental slavery to which the mass of the German professors hadsunk.  "They are living on the reputation made by us scientists,"he declared.  "They write volumes and they go about preachingthrough the land, but they contribute nothing, absolutely nothing,to the uplifting of humanity and of the country."  He told me ofhow Government spies before the war and during it watch professorswho are suspected of having independent ways of thought, and forthe slightest "offence" such as being in the audience of a SocialDemocratic lecture (this before the war, of course; such meetingsare forbidden now) they are put on the official black-list andpromotion is closed to them for ever.In warring Germany I found professors vying with one another to sowhatred among the people, to show that Germany is always right, andthat she is fighting a war of defence, which she tried to avoid byevery means in her power, and that any methods employed to crushGreat Britain, the real instigator of the attack on Germany, aregood methods.With the pastors, they spread the idea that "Germany is the rockselected by Almighty God upon which to build His Empire."  J. P.Bang, the able Danish Professor of Theology at the University ofCopenhagen, writes clearly on this point.  He says, when describingEmanuel Geibel:--"He has succeeded in finding the classical formula for the Germanarrogance, which of necessity demands that Germanism shall beplaced above everything else in the world, and at the same time ingiving this arrogance such an expression that it shall not conflictwith the German demand for moral justification.  This has beenachieved in the lines which have been quoted times without numberin the newest German war literature:  Und es mag am deutschen Wesen  Einmal noch die Welt genesen!  (The world may yet again be healed by Germanism.)"The hope here expressed has become a certainty for modern Germany,and the Germans see in this the moral basis for all their demands.Why must Germany be victorious, why must she have her place in thesun, why must her frontiers be extended, why is all opposition toGermany shameful, not to say devilish, why must Germany become aworld-empire, why ought Germany and not Great Britain to become thegreat Colonial Power?  Why, because it is through the medium ofGermanism that the world is to be healed; it is upon Germanism thatthe salvation of the world depends.  That is why all attacksagainst Germanism are against God's plans, in opposition to Hisdesigns for the world; in short, a sin against God.  The Germans donot seem to be able to understand that other nations cannot beparticularly delighted at being described as sickly shoots whichcan only be healed by coming under the influence of Germanfountains of health.  Yet one would think that, if they would onlyreflect a little upon what the two lines quoted above imply, theywould be able in some measure to understand the dislike for them,which they declare to be so incomprehensible."He also prophesied about the great master who would arise andcreate the unity of Germany.  This prophecy was brilliantlyfulfilled in Bismarck.  After 1866 he loudly clamours forAlsace-Lorraine.  This he cannot reasonably have expected to obtainwithout war; but when the war comes we hear exactly the same taleas now of the Germans' love of peace and the despicabledeceitfulness of their enemies.  'And the peace shall be a _Germanpeace_; now tremble before the sword of God and of Germany ye whoare strong in impiety and fruitful in bloodguiltiness.'"Hate lectures have been both fashionable and popular in Germanyduring the war.  I was attracted to one in Munich by flaming redand yellow posters which announced that Professor Werner Sombart ofthe University of Berlin would speak at the Vierjahreszeiten Hallon "Unser Hass gegen England" (Our Hatred of England).I sat among the elite of the Bavarian capital in a large hall witheven the standing room filled, when a black-bearded professorstepped upon the stage amid a flutter of handclapping and proceededto his task without any introduction.  He was a Professor ofHatred, and it soon became quite clear that he was full of hissubject.  His lank frame leaned over the footlights and he woundand unwound his long, thin fingers, while his lips sneered and hissharp black eyes gleamed venom as he instructed business men,bankers, smart young officers, lorgnetted dowagers and sweet-facedgirls, in the duty of hating with the whole heart and the wholemind.  I soon felt that if Lissauer is the Horace of Hate, Sombartis its Demosthenes."It is not our duty (_duty_ is always a good catchword in Germanappeal) to hate individual Englishmen, such as Sir Edward Grey andMr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George.  No, we must go far beyond that.We must hate the very essence of everything English.  We must hatethe very soul of England.  An abysmal gulf yawns between the twonations which can never, and must never, be bridged over.  We needborrow _Kultur_ from no nation on earth, for we ourselves havedeveloped the highest Kultur in the world."The professor continued in this strain for an hour and a half, andconcluded with the rather striking statements that _hatred is thegreatest force in the world to overcome tremendous obstacles_, andthat _either one must hate or one must fear_.The moral is, of course, obvious.  Nobody wishes to be a coward,therefore the only alternative is to hate.  Therefore, hate England!I watched the audience during the lecture and did not fail to notethe close attention shown the professor and the constant nods andsighs of assent of those about me.  I was not, however, preparedfor the wild tumult of applause at the finish.  Indeed the admiringthrong rushed to the stage to shower him with admiration."Das war aber zu schon!" sighed a dowager near me."Ja, ja, wunderbar.  Ein Berliner Professor!"  And the student with_Schmissen_ (sabre cuts) across his close-cropped head smacked hislips with, satisfaction over the words much as he might have doneover his Stein at the Furstenhof.I investigated Professor Sombart and learned from authority whichis beyond question that he was an out and out Government agentfoisted on to the University of Berlin against the wishes of itsfaculty.The name of Professor Joseph Kohler is known, all over the world tomen who have the slightest acquaintance with German jurisprudence.His literary output has been enormous and he has unquestionablymade many valuable contributions to legal science.  Even he,however, cannot do the impossible, and his "_Not kennt kein Gebot_"(Necessity knows no law), an attempt in the summer of 1915 tojustify the German invasion of Belgium, makes Germany's case onthis particular point appear worse than ever.The Empire of Rome and the Empire of Napoleon worked upon theprinciple that necessity knows no law.  Why should not the Empireof William II.?  That is the introductory theme.  The reader thenwades through page after page of classical philosophy, biblicalphilosophy, and modern German philosophy which support the theorythat a sin may not always be a sin.  One may steal, for example, ifby so doing a life he saved.  It naturally follows from this thatwhen a nation is confronted by a problem which involves its veryexistence it may do anything which may work to its advantage.  ThusGermany did right in attacking the little country she had solemnlysworn to defend, and history will later prove that the realbarbarians of the war are the Americans, since they are so abjectlyignorant as to call the Germans barbarians for acting as they did.So argues Joseph Kohler, who certainly ranks among the firsthalf-dozen professors of Germany.There are a few professors of international law in Germany,however, who have preserved a legally-balanced attitude despitetheir sympathies.   One of these wrote an article for a lawperiodical, many of the statements of which were in directcontradiction to statements in the German Press.  The Germanpeople, for example, were being instructed--a not difficulttask--that Britain was violating international law when her vesselshoisted a neutral flag during pursuit.  This professor simplyquoted paragraph 81 of the German Prize Code which showed thatorders to German ships were precisely the same.  Were this known tothe German population one of the ten thousand hate tricks would beout of commission.  Therefore, this and similar articles must besuppressed, not because they are not true, but because they wouldinterfere with the delusion of hate which saturates the mind of thenew Germany.  I have seen articles returned to this distinguishedwriter with the censor stamp: _Not to be published till after thewar_.When a winning Germany began to grow angry at American munitiondeliveries I heard much talk of the indemnity which the UnitedStates would be compelled to pay after Europe had been dulydisposed of.  Professor Hermann Oncken, of the University ofHeidelberg, made this his theme in a widely read booklet, entitled,"_Deutschlands Weltkrieg und die Deutsch-Amerikaner_."Professor P.  von Gast, of the Technical College of Aachen, doesnot appear to realise that his country has a sufficient job on herhands in Europe and Africa, but thinks the midst of a great war asuitable time to arouse his countrymen against the United States inLatin America.  He explains that the Monroe Doctrine was simply anattempt on the part of the great Anglo-Saxon Republic to gobble upthe whole continent to the south for herself.  "All the world mustoppose America in this attempt," he feels.Then there is Professor Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who writes onreprisals in the _Juristenblatt_ of July, 1916.  It should be bornein mind that he is a professor of law and that he is writing in abook which is read by legal minds and not by the general public;all the more reason that we should expect something that wouldcontain common sense.  Professor Bartholdy, after expressing hisprofound horror over the French raid on Karlsruhe, hastens toexplain that such methods can be of not the slightest militaryadvantage to the French, but will only arouse Germany to fight allthe harder.  He deplores enemy attacks on unfortified districts,and claims that the French military powers confess that such actsare not glorious by their failure to pin decorations on the breastsof the aviators who perpetrate them, in the same way as the GermanStaff honours heroes like Boelke and Immelmann, who fight, as doall German aviators, like men.There have been many incidents outside of Germany of which theprofessor apparently has never heard, or else his sense of humouris below the zero mark.My talks with German professors impressed me with how little mostof them keep in touch with the war situation from day to day andfrom month to month.  A Berlin professor of repute with whom Isipped coffee one day in the Cafe Bauer expressed the greatestsurprise when he heard that a neutral could actually get fromAmerica to Germany.  I heard this opinion very often among thecommon people, but had supposed that doctors of philosophy weresomewhat better informed.During my conversation with another professor, whose war remarkshave been circulated in the neutral countries by the Official NewsService, he remarked that he read the London Times and otherEnglish newspapers regularly."Oh, so you get the English papers?" I asked, fully aware that onemay do so in Germany."Not exactly," returned the professor.  "The Government has a verynice arrangement by which condensed articles from the Englishnewspapers are prepared and sent to us professors."This was the final straw.  I had always considered professors to bemen who did research work, and I supposed that professors onpolitical science and history consulted original sources whenpossible.  Yet the German professor of the twentieth century, iscontent to take what the Government gives him and only what theGovernment gives to him.Thus we find that the professor is a great power in Germany in thecontrol of the minds of the people, and that the Governmentcontrols the mind of the professor.  He is simply one of theinstruments in the German Government's Intellectual Blockade of theGerman people.CHAPTER VITHE LIE ON THE FILMAt the end of an absorbingly interesting reel showing the Kaiserreviewing his troops, a huge green trade-mark globe revolved with astreamer fluttering _Berlin_.  The lights were turned on and theoperator looked over his assortment of reels.An American had been granted permission to take war films inGermany in the autumn of 1914, to be exhibited in the UnitedStates.  After he had arrived, however, the authorities had refusedto let him take pictures with the army, but, like the proverbialdruggist, had offered him something "just as good."  In London, onhis return journey home, he showed to a few newspapercorrespondents the films which Germany had foisted upon him."The next film, gentlemen, will depict scenes in East Prussia," theoperator announced.Although I had probably seen most of these pictures in Germany, myinterest quickened, for I had been through that devastated provinceduring and after the first invasion.  Familiar scenes of ruinedvillages and refugees scudding from the sulphur storm passed beforemy eyes.  Then came the ruined heap of a once stately church tagged_Beautiful Church in Allenburg Destroyed by the Russians_.  Thedestruction seemed the more heinous since a trace of former beautylived through the ruins, and you could not view this link ofevidence against the Russians without a feeling of resentment.This out-of-the-way church was not architecturally important to theworld as is Rheims Cathedral, to be sure, but the destructionseemed just as wanton.The next picture flashed on the screen showed a Russian churchintact, with the simple title, _Russian Church at Potetschiki_.The moral of the sequence was clear.  The German Government, up tothe minute in all things, knows the vivid educative force of thekinema, and realises the effect of such a sequence of pictures uponher people at home and neutrals throughout the world, It enablesthem to see for themselves the difference between the barbarousRussians and the generous Germans.The reel buzzed on, but I did not see the succeeding pictures, formy thoughts were of far-off East Prussia, of Allenburg, and of thetrue story of the ruined church by the Alle River.Tannenberg had been fought, Samsanow had been decisively smashed inthe swamps and plashy streams, and Hindenburg turned north-east tocut off Rennenkampf's army, which had advanced to the gates ofKonigsberg.  The outside world had been horrified by stories ofGerman crime in Belgium; whereupon Germany counter attacked withreports of terrible atrocities perpetrated by the Russians, of boyswhose right hands had been cut off so that they could never servein the army, of wanton murder, rapine and burnings.  I read thesestories in the Berlin papers, and they filled me with a deepfeeling against Russia.One of the most momentous battles of history was being fought inthe West, and the Kaiser's armies were in full retreat from theMarne to the Aisne, but Berlin knew nothing of this.  Refugees fromEast Prussia with white arm-bands filled the streets, Hindenburgand victory were on every tongue, Paris was forgotten, and allinterest centred in the Eastern theatre of war.That was in the good old days when the war was young, when armieswere taking up positions, when the management of newspaperreporters was not developed to a fine art, when Europe wastopsy-turvy, when it was quite the thing for war correspondents tooutwit the authorities and see all they could.I resolved to make an attempt to get into East Prussia, and as itwas useless to wait for official permission--that is, if I was tosee things while fresh--I determined to play the game and trust toluck.Danzig seemed the end of my effort, for the railroad running eastwas choked with military trains, the transportation of troops andsupplies in one direction and prisoners and wounded in the other.By good fortune, however, I booked passage on a boat for Konigsberg.The little steamer nosed its way through a long lock canal amidscenery decidedly Dutch, with old grey windmills dotting broad fiatstretches, black and white cows looming large and distinct on thelandscape, and fish nets along the waters edge.  To the right theshore grew bolder after we entered the _Frishes Haff_, a broadlagoon separated from the Baltic by a narrow strip of pasture land.Red sails glowed in the clear sunshine, adding an Adriatic touch.Cumbersome junk-like boats flying the Red Cross passed west underfull sail.  Germany was using every man at her disposal totransport wounded and prisoners from the battle region which wewere drawing near.A smoky haze ahead indicated Konigsberg.  The mouth of the Pregelbustled with activity, new fortifications were being everywherethrown up, while indistinct field-grey figures swarmed over theplain like ants.  We glided through forests of masts and riggingand slid up to a pier opposite great sagging warehouses behindwhich the sun was setting.As I picked up my bag to go ashore, a heavy hand fell on myshoulder and I was asked to wait until we were boarded from thepolice boat which was puffing alongside.  My detainer, a governmentinspector, a man of massive frame with deep set eyes and a shaggyblack beard, refused to say more than that the police wished to seeme.  They had been signalled and were coming to the boat expresslyfor that purpose.American ammunition had not begun to play its part in German publicopinion at that time, and, moreover, America was being hailedeverywhere in Germany as a possible ally against Japan.  Therefore,although only a few days previously Russian guns had been boomingless than a dozen miles away, and Konigsburg was now the baseagainst Rennenkampf, my presence was tolerated, and I finallymanaged to get lodgings for the night after I had found two hotelsturned into hospitals,I spent the following day trying to obtain permission to pass thecordon of sentries outside the city, but I received only the adviceto go back to Berlin and apply at the _Auswartiges Amt_ (ForeignOffice).  I did not wish to wait in Berlin until this campaign wasover; I wished to follow on the heels of the army through theruined land and catch up to the fighting if possible.  Americancorrespondents had done this in Belgium.  I myself had done it withthe Austrians against the Serbs, and I succeeded in East Prussia,but not through Berlin.I was well aware that Germany was making a tremendous bid forneutral favour.  I had furthermore heard so much of Russianatrocities that I was convinced that the stories were true;consequently I decided to play the role of an investigator ofMuscovite crime.  I won Herr Meyer of the Wolff Telegraph Bureau,who sent me along with his card to Commandant von Rauch, who atfirst refused to let me proceed, but after I had hovered outsidehis door for three days, finally gave me a pass to go to Tapiau,the high-water mark of the Russian invasion.That night, "by chance," in the _Deutscher Hof_, I met theblack-bearded official who had arrested me on the boat, and I toldhim that I had permission to go to Tapiau next morning.  When hebecame convinced, that I was a professional atrocity hunter whobelieved that the Russians had been brutal, his hospitality becameboundless, and over copious steins of Munich beer he described theinvaders in a manner which made Gladstone's expose of the Turks inBulgaria, the stories of Captain Kidd, and the tales of the SpanishInquisition seem like essays on brotherly love.  He wasparticularly incensed at the Russians because they had destroyedAllenburg, for Allenburg was his home.  One of the stories on whichhe laid great stress was that a band of Cossacks had pillaged thechurch just outside of Allenburg on the road to Friedland, afterthey had driven sixty innocent maidens into it and outraged themthere.A train of the _Militar-Personenzug_ variety bore me next morningthrough a country of barbed wire, gun emplacements and fieldsseamed with trenches to Tapiau, a town withered in the blast ofwar.  Two ruined bridges in the Pregel bore silent testimony to thestraits of the retreating Germans, for the remaining ends on thefurther shore were barricaded with scraps of iron and wood gatheredfrom the wreckage.Landsturm guards examined my pass, which was good only for Tapiauand return.  I decided to miss the train back, however, and push onin the wake of the army to Wehlau.  Outside of Tapiau I waschallenged by a sentry, who, to my amazement, did not examine mynow worthless pass when I pulled it from my pocket, but motioned meon.The road ran through eye-tiring stretches of meadows pockmarkedwith great shell holes full of black water.  I came upon theremains of an old brick farmhouse battered to dust in woods whichwere torn to splinters by shell, bullet and shrapnel.  The Russianshad bombarded Tapiau from here, and had in turn been shelled in thetrenches which they had dug and chopped in the labyrinth of roots.Among the debris of tins, cases, knapsacks and cartridge clips werefragments of uniforms which had been blown off Russian bodies byGerman shells, while on a branch above my head a shrivelled humanarm dangled in the light breeze of September.I left the sickening atmosphere of the woods behind and pushed onto Wehlau, a primitive little town situated on the meadows wherethe Alle flows into the Pregel.  Here my troubles began.  Soldiersstared at me as I walked through crooked, narrow streets unevenlypaved with small stones in a manner that would bring joy to theheart of a shoe manufacturer.  The sun sank in a cloudless blazebehind a line of trenches on a gentle slope above the western shorewhen I entered the _Gasthof Rabe_, where I hoped to get a room forthe night.I had no sooner crossed the threshold, however, than I was arrestedand brought to the Etappen-Commandant in the Pregelstrasse.  Ifully expected to be placed under arrest or be deported, but Idetermined to put up the best bluff possible.  A knowledge ofGermans and their respect for any authority above that invested intheir own individual selves led me to decide upon a bold course ofaction, so I resolved to play the game with a high hand and with anabsolute exterior confidence of manner.Instead of waiting to be questioned when I was brought into thepresence of the stern old officer, I told him at once that I hadbeen looking for him.  I informed him that Herr von Meyer andCommandant Rauch in Konigsberg were in hearty sympathy with mysearch for Russian atrocities, but although I succeeded in quietingany suspicions which the Commandant may have entertained, I foundwinning permission to stay in Wehlau an exceedingly difficultmatter.Orders were orders!  He explained that the battle was rollingeastward not far away and that I must go back.  To add weight towhat he said he read me a set of typewritten orders which had comefrom Berlin the day before.  "Journalists are not allowed with thearmy or in the wake of the army in East Prussia. . . ." he read, ina tone which indicated that he considered the last word said.But I had become so fascinated with this battle-scarred, uncanny,out-of-the-way land that I resolved to try every means to stay.  Ideclared that on this particular mission I was more of aninvestigator than a journalist, that I had the special task(self-imposed, to be sure) of investigating Russian atrocities;that if Berlin reports were to be given credence abroad they mustbe substantiated by some impartial observer.  If Germany wouldsupply the atrocities, I would supply the copy.  That she wished todo so was evidenced by the permissions granted me by Herr von Meyerof the Wolff Telegraph Bureau and Commandant Rauch of the capitalof the devastated province.  (I had passed beyond the point where Iwas told that I could go, but at any rate their names carriedweight.)  Would it not seem strange if the Commandant at Wehlau hadme sent back after these great men had set their seal of approvalupon my investigations?  After Germany had made such grave chargesagainst the Russians, how would it impress American readers thatthe German Commandant at Wehlau could not make good and had sent meback?Then, as a finishing stroke, I pulled my passport from my pocketand showed Berlin's approval of me stamped impressively in theright-hand corner.  This vise was not at all unique with me.  Ithad been affixed to the passports of thousands of Americans of allgrades, and was merely to ensure passage from Germany into Holland.As I did not wish to impose upon the time of the Commandant I didnot burden him with these extraneous details while he feasted hiseyes on the magic words: _Gesehen, Berlin_.  Mount Olympus, Mecca,Imperial and Ecclesiastical Rome all rolled into one--that isauthoritative Berlin to the German of the province."Gesehen, Berlin" he repeated with reverence, carefully folded thepassport and deferentially handed it back to me.  I saw that I waswinning, so I sought to rise to the occasion."And now, Herr Commandant," I began, "can you suggest where I maybest begin my atrocity work tomorrow?  Or first, would it not bewell for me to get a more complete idea of the invasion by seeingon the map just what routes the Russians took coming in?"He unfolded a large military map of peerless German accuracy andregaled me for more than half an hour with the military features ofthe campaign."Just tell me the worst things that the Russians have done," Ibegan, "and I will start investigating them tomorrow."Then he anathematised the Russians and all things Russian, whilehis orderly stood stiffly and admiringly at attention and the otherofficers stopped in their tracks."First you should visit the ruins of the once beautiful old castleat Labiau destroyed by the beasts," he thundered.   "And they alsowantonly destroyed the magnificent old church near by."He followed with an account of the history of the castle, and itwas clear that he was deeply affected by the loss of theselandscape embellishments which he had learned to love so much thatthey became part of his life, and that their destruction deeplyenraged him against the enemy.  Though I saw his point of view andsympathised with him, I questioned him in the hope of learning ofsome real atrocities.  It was useless.  Although he made generalcharges against the Russians, he always reverted, when pinned downto facts, with a fresh burst of anger, to the castle and church ofLabiau as his pet atrocity.The orderly had just been commanded to take me on a search forquarters for the night, when an automobile horn tooted beneath thewindow.  Heavy steps on the stairs; a Staff Officer entered theroom, looked surprised to see me, and asked who I was.  TheCommandant justified his permission to let me remain by eulogisingthe noble work upon which I was engaged, but though the StaffOfficer's objections were hushed, he did not enthuse over my coming.With intent to convince him that I was already hard at work I toldhim of the terrible destruction of the castle and church at Labiau,which I would visit on the following day."I have a sergeant below who was there, and I will have him comein," he said.The sergeant entered, clicked his heels at attention; a doughty oldwarrior, small and wiry, not a civilian thrust into field-grey, buta soldier, every inch of him, a Prussian soldier, turned to stonein the presence of his superior officers, his sharp clear eyesstrained on some point in space directly ahead.  He might havestepped out of the pages of the Seven Years' War.Nobody spoke.  The pale yellow light of the oil lamp on theCommandants desk fell on the military faces, figures and trappingsof the men in the room.  The shuffling tramp of soldiers in thedark street below died away in the direction of the river.  I feltthe military tenseness of the scene.  I realised that I was insidethe German lines on a bluff that was succeeding but might collapseat any moment.Feeling that a good investigating committee should displayinitiative I broke the silence by questioning the little sergeant,and I began on a line which I felt would please the Commandant,"You were at Labiau during the fighting?" I asked."I was, sir!"He did not move a muscle except those necessary for speech.  Hiseyes were still rigid on that invisible something directly ahead.He clearly was conscious of the importance of his position, asinformant to a stranger before his superior officers."I have heard that the beautiful old castle and the magnificent oldchurch were destroyed," I continued."You know of this, of course?""Ja, ja, that is true!  Our wonderful artillery knocked them topieces when we drove the Russians out in panic!"The sergeant was not the only one looking into space now.  TheStaff Officer relieved the situation by dismissing him from theroom, whereupon the Commandant sharply bade the orderly conduct meto my night lodgings."No Iron Cross for the little sergeant," I reflected, as westumbled through the cooked old streets in the dark.  Is it anywonder that the German Government insists that neutralcorrespondents be chaperoned by someone who can skilfully show themwhat is proper for them to see, and let them hear that which isproper for them to hear?Everywhere in rooms lighted by oil lamps soldiers sat talking,drinking and playing cards.  They were under every roof, and werealso bivouacked on the flats along the river.  In all three innsthere was not even floor space available.   The little brick townhall, too, was crowded with soldiers.At the pontoon bridge we were sharply challenged by a sentry.  Theorderly answered and we passed on to a crowded beer hall abovewhich I was fortunate to secure a room.  By the flickering light ofa candle I was conducted to a dusty attic furnished withferruginous junk in one corner and a dilapidated bed in another.No such luxuries as bed clothing, of course; only a red mattresswhich had not been benefited in the least by Russian bayonetthrusts and sabre slashes in the quest of concealed treasure.  Icould not wash unless I would go down to the river, for with theblowing up of the bridges the water mains had also been destroyed.The excellent organisation of the Germans was in evidence, however,for during my stay I witnessed their prompt and efficient measuresto restore sanitation, in order to avert disease.I went downstairs and entered the large beer room, hazy withtobacco smoke, and filled for the most part with non-commissionedofficers.  They, like everybody else in the room, seemed to haveheard of my arrival.  I joined a group at a long table, a jovialcrowd of men who chaffed good naturedly one of their number whosaid he wished to be home with his wife and little ones.  Theylooked at me and laughed, then pointing at him said, "He is nowarrior!"But it was their talk about the Russians which, interested me most.There was no hate in their speech, only indifference and contemptfor their Eastern enemy.  Hindenburg was their hero, and they dranktoast after toast to his health.  The Russian menace was over, theyfelt; Britain and France would be easily smashed.  They loved theirArmy, their Emperor, and Hindenburg, and believed implicitly in allthree.They sang a song of East Prussia and raised their foaming glassesat the last two lines:  "Es trinkt der Mensch, es sauft das Pferd,  In Ostpreussen 1st das umgekehrt."While they were singing a man in civilian clothes entered,approached me with an air of authority, and announced in a loudtone of voice that he had heard that I had said that I had come toEast Prussia in search of Russian atrocities."My name is Curtin," I began, introducing myself, although I feltsomewhat uneasy."Thomas!" was all he said."Good Heavens!" I thought.  "Is this man looking for me?  Am I infor serious trouble now?"Instead, however, of _Thomas_ being an interrogation as to my firstname, it was his simple introduction of himself--a strangecoincidence.Although he was addressing his remarks to me, he exclaimed in atone which could be heard all over the room that he was Chief ofPolice during the Russian occupation of Wehlau for three weeks, andtook great pride in asserting that he was the man who could tell meall that I wished to know.  He was highly elated because theRussians had employed him, given him a whistle and invested himwith authority to summon aid if he detected any wrong-doing.  Theyhad furthermore paid him for his services.   Although he nowroundly tongue-lashed them in general terms, there was no definitepersonal accusation that he could make against them.He told me of a sergeant who went into a house, ordered a meal andthen demanded money, threatening the woman who had served him.  Alieutenant entered at this moment, learned the particulars of thealtercation, and struck the sergeant, whom he reproved fordisobeying commands for good conduct which had come fromHeadquarters.  "Just think of such lack of respect among officers,"Thomas concluded.  "One officer striking another for something doneagainst a person in an enemy country.  That is bad for discipline.Such a thing would never happen in the German Army."The moral of the story as I saw it was quite different from what hehad intended it to be.A few days later I was again in the crowded beer hall when HerrThomas entered.  He liked to be in the limelight, and had a mostextraordinary manner of apparently addressing his conversation tosome selected individual, but carried it on in a tone which couldbe heard throughout the entire room.  The Russian whistle which hestill wore, and of which he was very proud, threatened to become amillstone about his neck, for returning refugees were accusing himof inefficiency during his reign, since they asserted that theRussians had stolen their goods from under his very nose.After he had hurled the usual invectives against the invaders formy benefit, two splendid looking officers, captain and lieutenant,both perfect gentlemen, said that they hoped that I would notbecome so saturated with this talk that I would write unfairlyabout the Russians.  They added that they had been impressed by theRussian officers in that region and the control which they hadexercised over their men.Early next morning I met the big man with the black beard who waseither on my trail or had encountered me again by chance.  When Isaid that I was going to Allenburg, of the destruction of which Ihad heard so much, he practically insisted that I go with him inhis carriage.  A mysterious stranger in brown was with him, whoalso assisted in the sight-seeing.We road through a gently undulating farming and grazing country tothe Alle River, where we boarded a little Government tug whichthreaded its way through dead cows, horses, pigs, dogs, and now andthen a man floating down the stream.  Battered trenches, ruinedfarmhouses, splintered woods, the hoof marks of Russian horses thathad forded the stream under German fire, showed that the strugglehad been intense along the river.  The plan of battle formed in mymind.  It was clear that the Germans had made the western bank amain line of defence, which, however, had been broken through."Just wait until we reach Allenburg," said the man in brown, "andyou will see what beasts the murdering Russians are.  Wait untilyou see how they have destroyed that innocent town!"According to the course of the battle and the story of the Russiandestruction of Allenburg, I expected to find it on the westernbank, but to my great surprise it is on the eastern, with aconsiderable stretch of road, separating it from the river.  Weleft the boat and walked along this road, on each side of which laywillows in perfect rows where they had been skilfully felled by theRussians.  This sight evoked new assaults from my guides upon "thebeasts" whom they accused of wanton and wilful violation of thearboreal beauty which the Allenburgers had loved.I put myself in the place of the citizens of Allenburg, returningto their little town devastated by war; I understood their feelingsand I sympathised with them.  I was seeing the other side ofGermany's page of conquest.  The war map of Europe shows that shehas done most of the invading, and during all the days I spent inthe Fatherland I never heard a single word of pity for the peopleof the regions overrun by her armies--except, of course, thePecksniffian variety used by her diplomats.  It was now any rareprivilege to return with German refugees to _their_ ruined country,and they vied with one another when they talked to me in thepresence of my guides in accusing the Russians of every crime underthe sun.  The war had been brought home to them, but in themeantime other Germans had brought the war home even more forciblyto the citizens of Belgium and northern France, but the thing couldnot balance in the minds of those affected.I was conducted to a combination home and chemist's shop, the upperpart of which had been wrecked by a shell.  The Russians had lootedthe place of chemicals and had searched through all the letters inthe owner's desk.  These they had thrown upon the floor instead ofputting them back neatly in the drawers.My guides laid great stress on such crimes, but I took mental noteof certain other things which were not pointed out to me.  Thebeasts--as they always called them--had been quartered here forthree weeks, but not a mirror had been cracked, not a scratchmarred the highly polished black piano, and the well-stocked,exquisitely carved bookcase was precisely as it had been before thefirst Cossack patrol entered the city.The owner viewed his loss philosophically.  "When we have placed awar indemnity upon Russia I shall be paid in full," he declared ina voice of supreme confidence.My guides never gave me an opportunity to talk alone with the fewcivilians in the place, and at the sausage and beer lunch theconversation was based on the "wanton destruction by the beasts ofan innocent town."After they had drunk so much beer that they both fell asleep Islipped quietly away and went about amid the ruins.  I came uponhuman bodies burned to a crisp.  Heaps of empty cartridge shellslittered the ground, which I examined with astonishment for theywere Russian, not German, shells, and must have been used by mendefending the town.I met a pretty girl of seventeen drawing water at a well, who hadremained during the three weeks that the Russians were there tocare for her invalid father, and had not suffered the slightestinsult.  Yet all my informants had told me that the Russians hadspared none of the weaker sex who had remained in their path.Further investigations had revealed that the Russians had not fireda shot upon the town, but that the Germans had destroyed it drivingthem out.I entered a little Roman Catholic church in the undamaged sectionof the town and noted with interest that nothing had apparentlybeen disturbed--this the more significant since the Russians hold adifferent faith.I walked back towards the river and strolled through the neat,well-shaded, churchyard to the ruins of the large church, thedominating feature of the town.  It was clear from what was leftthat the lines of the body and the spire had been of rare beautyfor such an insignificant place as Allenburg."Too bad!" I remarked to a white-haired old man who was sitting ona bench mournfully contemplating the ruins."Sad, so sad!" he said in a voice full of grief.  "And it seemssadder that it had to be done by our own people," he added."Were you here during the fighting?" I asked."I was," he answered.  "I would rather die than leave this place,where I was born and where I have always lived."I returned to the anxious guides add told them that I had visitedthe ruins of the church."A destruction which could serve no military purpose," declared theman in brown.  "You see the methods of the people Germany isfighting."I expressed a desire to seek only one more thing, the church on theroad to Friedland which had been destroyed by the Russians afterthe sixty maidens had been driven into it.  We went to it, but,alas! it had not been disturbed in the least.  I somehow felt thatmy guides saw the lack of destruction with genuine regret.  The bigman with the black beard was at a loss to reconcile the story hetold me at Konigsberg with the actual facts found on the spot."Somebody must have made a mistake," was all he said.My last view of Allenburg was from across the river with the longrays of the setting sun burnishing the ruins of the once beautifulchurch, the church I saw months later on the screen in the Londondisplay room, the church that has been shown all over the world asevidence of Russian methods in war.I went all through East Prussia studying first hand the effects ofthe great campaign.  My luck increased from day to day.  I secureda military pass to visit all hospitals in the XXth Army Corps,which aided my investigations not a little.  The prejudice which Ihad against the Russians died in East Prussia.  It was buriedforever the following winter when I was with the Russian Army inthe memorable retreat through the Bukowina.  In East Prussia I wasin an entirely different position from a man investigatingconditions in Belgium, for I was in the German's own country afterhe had driven out the invader.  I tried to see some youth whosehand had been cut off, but could not find a single case, although,everybody had heard of such mutilations.  The fact that no doctorwhom I questioned knew of any case was sufficient refutation, sincea person whose hand had been cut off would need something more thana bandage tied on at home.When the Russians entered the province they struck yellow and blackposters everywhere announcing that it was annexed to Russia.  Inview of this the Russian officers were instructed to restrain theirmen and to treat the natives well.  Isolated cases of violence, forthe most part murder and robbery of the victim, had occurred wheremen had broken away from restraint, but they were surprisingly few.After I returned to Berlin I met an American correspondent who wasin East Prussia when I was.  His sympathies were pro-German, but hewas an, open and fair-minded man, who, like me, had left Berlinwith a deep feeling against the Russians, thanks to the excellentGerman propaganda.  "I went especially to get some good stories ofRussian atrocities," he said.  "I thought that every mile would beblood-marked with evidence, but I came back defeated.  Some pettylarceny and robbery, a Red Cross flag torn to shreds by a Russianshell, two old men murdered and robbed by Cossacks, and a woman inthe hospital at Soldau, who had been outraged by five Cossacks, wasall that I could find, even though I was aided by the GermanGovernment."My own first-hand investigations convinced me that it would bedifficult for any army in the world to conduct a cleaner campaignthan Russia conducted in her first invasion of East Prussia.  Iremind the reader that I am speaking of the _first_ invasion, for Ihave no personal knowledge of the second.   Subsequently in Germanywhen.  I spoke of the matter I was always told that it was the_second_ invasion which was so bad.  Perhaps!  But I had beenfooled when Berlin cried wolf the first time.By a stroke of fortune while in East Prussia I became "assistant"for two days to a Government moving picture photographer who had apass for himself and assistant in those happy days of inexactitude.We formed the kind of close comradeship which men form who aresuffocated but unhurt by a shell which kills and maims others allabout them.  That had been our experience.  He had, moreover, beenover much of the ground covered by me behind the front."I am instructed to get four kinds of pictures," he explained."(1) Pictures which show German patriotism and unity.  (2) Pictureswhich show German organisation and efficiency.  (3) Pictures whichshow evidence of humanity in the German Army.  (4) Pictures whichshow destruction by the enemy.  Some of my pictures are kept by the_Kriegsministerium_ for purposes of studying the war.  The greaterpart, however, are used for propaganda both at home and abroad.Furthermore, I must be careful to keep an accurate record of whateach picture is.  The pictures are then arranged and given suitabletitles in Berlin,"I thought of all this in the London display-room when the familiarpicture of the ruined church flashed before my eyes with the title_Beautiful Church at Allenburg Destroyed by the Russians_--adeliberate lie on the film.I have nothing to say against the Germans for knocking their owntown to pieces or against the British and French for knockingFrench towns to pieces.  That is one of the misfortunes of war.The point is, that the propaganda department of the Wilhelmstrassefully understands that people who do not see the war, especiallyneutrals, are shocked at the destruction of churches.   The Germanshave been taught an unpleasant lesson in this in the case ofRheims.  Therefore they answer by falsifying a film when it suitstheir purpose with just as little compunction as they repudiatepromises."A little thing!" you might say.That adds to its importance, for it is attention to detail whichcharacterises modern Germany.  It is the subtle things which aredifficult to detect.  The Government neglects nothing which willaid in the ownership of public opinion at home and the influencingof neutrals throughout the world.CHAPTER VIITHE IDEA FACTORYA group of diplomats and newspaper correspondents were gathered atlunch in a German city early in the war, when one of the latter, anAmerican, asked how a certain proposition which was being discussedwould suit public opinion.  "Will public opinion favour such amove?" he questioned."Public opinion!  Public opinion!" a member of the German ForeignOffice repeated in a tone which showed that he was honestlyperplexed.  "Why, we create it!"He spoke the truth.  They certainly do.The State-controlled professor, parson and moving-picture producerappeal to limited audiences in halls and churches, but thenewspaper is ubiquitous, particularly in a country where illiteracyis practically unknown, and where regulations bidding andforbidding are constantly appearing in the newspapers--the readingof which is thus absolutely necessary if one would avoid frictionwith the authorities.In a free Press, like that of the United States or Great Britain,the truth on any question of public interest is reasonably certainto come to light sooner or later.  Competition is keen, and if onepaper does not dig up and publish the facts, a rival is likely todo so.  The German Press was gaining a limited degree of freedombefore the war, but that has been wiped away.  As in otherbelligerent countries news of a military nature must quite properlypass the censor.  But in Germany, unlike Great Britain, forexample, all other topics must be written in a manner to please theGovernment, or trouble ensues for the writer and his paper.  To acertain extent the Press is a little unmuzzled during the sittingsof the Reichstag--not much, but somewhat, for the reports of theReichstag proceedings are strictly censored.  The famous speech ofDeputy Bauer in May, 1916, was a striking example, for not a wordof his speech, the truth of which was not questioned, was allowedto appear in a single German newspaper.  The suppression of most ofHerr Hoffmann's speech in the Prussian Diet in January, 1917, isanother important case in point.  This is in striking contrast tothe British Parliament, which is supreme, and over whose reportsthe Press Bureau has no control.  The German Press Bureau, on theother hand, revises and even suppresses the publication ofspeeches.  When necessary, it specially transmits speeches bytelegram and wireless to foreign countries if it thinks thosespeeches will help German propaganda.The Berlin and provincial editors are summoned from time to time tomeetings, when they are addressed by members of the Government asto what it is wise for them to say and not to say.  These meetingsconstitute a hint that if the editors are indiscreet, if they, forexample, publish matter "calculated to promote disunity," they maybe subject to the increasingly severe penalties now administered.If a newspaper shows a tendency to kick over the traces, aGovernment emissary waits upon the editor, calls his attention toany offending article or paragraph, and suggests a correction.  Ifa newspaper still offends, it is liable to a suspension for a dayor even a week, or it may be suppressed altogether.But in peace, as well as in war, editors all over Germany wereinstructed as to the topic on which to lay accent for a limitedperiod, and just how to treat that topic.  For example, during thethree months preceding the war, Russia was bitterly attacked in theGerman Press.  From August 1 to August 4, 1914, the German peoplehad it crammed down their throats that she was the sole cause ofthe war.  On August 4 the Government marshalled the editors andprofessors and ordered them to throw all the responsibility onBritain, and the hate was switched from one to the other with thespeed and ease of a stage electrician throwing the lever from redto blue.How do the editors like being mere clerks for the Government?  Thelimited numbers of editors of independent thought, such as the"relentless" Count Reventlow, Maximilian Harden, and Theodor Wolff,detest such a role, and struggle against it.  After sincere andthorough investigation, however, I am convinced the average Germaneditor or reporter, like the average professor, prefers to have hisnews handed to him to digging it up for himself.In this connection the remark made to me by the editor of a littlepaper in East Prussia is interesting.  After the Russians hadfallen back he told me of two boys in a neighbouring village whosehands had been cut off.  He said that he was going to run thestory, and suggested that I also use it.  I proposed that we make alittle trip of investigation, as we could do so in a couple ofhours.He looked surprised.  "Why, we have the story already," he declared."But I am not going to write it unless I can prove it," I replied.A moment later I heard him sigh with despair as he half whisperedto a cavalry captain: "Yes, yes, alas, over there the Press is inthe hands of the people!"Many newspaper readers run more or less carelessly througharticles, and many more simply read the headlines and headings.The Official Press Bureau, for which no detail is too minute,realises this perfectly, with the result that German newspaperheadings are constructed, less with a view to sensationalism, as insome British and American papers, or with a view to condenseaccurately the chief news feature of the day, as to impress thereader--or the hearer, since the headlines are cried shrilly inBerlin and other cities--with the idea that Germany is alwaysmaking progress towards ultimate victory.  The daily reports of theGeneral Staff have been excellent, with a few notable exceptionssuch as the Battle of the Marne and the Battle of the Somme.During reverses, however, they have shown a tendency to packunpalatable truths in plenty of "shock absorber," with the resultthat the public mind, as I know from my personal investigations, iscompletely befogged as to the significance of military operationswhich did not go in a manner satisfactory to the German leaders.In all this the headline never failed to cheer.  When the Russianswere smashing the Austrians in the East, while the British andFrench were making important gains and inflicting much moreimportant losses on the Somme, the old reliable headline--TERRIBLERUSSIAN LOSSES--was used until it was worn threadbare.What would you think, you who live in London or Hew York, if youwoke up some morning to find every newspaper in the city with thesame headlines?  And would you not be surprised to learn thatnearly every newspaper throughout your country had the sameheadlines that day?  You would conclude that there was wonderfulcentral control somewhere, would you not?Yet that is what happens in Germany repeatedly.  It is of specialsignificance on "total days."  Those are the days when theGovernment, in the absence of fresh victories, adds the totals ofprisoners taken for a given period, and as only the totals appearin the headlines the casual reader feels nearer a victorious peace.On the morning of March 13, 1916, most of the papers had "total"headlines for Verdun.Not so the _Tageblatt_.  Theodor Wolff, its editor, has had so muchjournalistic experience, outside of Germany, and is, moreover, aman of such marked ability, that he is striving to be somethingmore than a sycophantic clerk of the Government.  He is not agrumbler, not a dissatisfied extremist, not unpatriotic, butpossesses a breadth of outlook patriotic in the highest sense.  Onthe morning after the Liebknecht riots in the Potsdamer Platz, hispaper did not appear.  The reason given by the Commandant of theMark of Brandenburg was that he had threatened the _Burgfriede_ bycharging certain interests in Germany with attempting to make thewar a profitable institution.  But there are those who say that thepolice were very watchful in the newspaper offices that night, andthat the _Tageblatt_ did not appear because of its attempt to printsome of the happenings in the Potsdamer Platz.It has been the custom of Herr Wolff to write a front-page articleevery Monday morning signed T. W.  On the last Monday morning inJuly, 1916, in a brilliantly written article, the first part ofwhich patted the Government on the back for some things, hedelicately expressed a desire for reform in diplomatic methodswhich would render war-making less easy.  Then he added that ifsome statesman, such as Prince Bulow, had been called as adviser inJuly, 1914, a way to avert the war might have been found.This so angered the Government, which has successfully convincedits great human sheep-fold that Germany is the innocent victim ofattack, that the _Tageblatt_ was suppressed for nearly a week, and,like the ex-Socialist paper _Vorwaerts_, was permitted to reappearonly after it promised "to be good."  Theodor Wolff was personallysilenced for several months.  This was his greatest but not hisonly offence.  All over Germany the people have been officiallytaught to regard this great war time as _die grosse Zeit_.  Wolff,however, sarcastically set the expression in invertedcommas--thereby committing a sacrilege against the State.Throughout Germany monuments have been reared and nails driven intoemblems marked DIE GROSSE ZEIT.  I have often wondered just whatthoughts these monuments will arouse in the German's mind if hiscountry is finally beaten and all his bloodshed and fooddeprivation will have been in vain.The Press has, of course, been the chief instrument, reinforced bythe schoolmaster, professor and parson, in spreading the doctrineof scientific hatred.  It is not generally known that Deputy Cohn,speaking in the Reichstag on April 8, 1916, sharply criticised themethod of interning British civilians at Ruhleben.  He went on tosay that, "reports of the persecutions of Germans in England weremagnified and to some extent invented by the German Press in orderto stir up war feeling against England."I saw a brilliant example of the German Press Bureau's attention todetails in the late autumn of 1914.  I was on a point of vantagehalf way up the Schlossberg behind Freiburg during the first aerialattack by the French in that region.  In broad daylight a solitaryairman flew directly over the town and went on until he wasdirectly over the extensive barracks just outside.  Freiburg is acompact city of 85,000 inhabitants, and it would have been easy tohave caused damage, and probably loss of life to the civilianpopulation.  It was clear to me in my front-row position and to thenatives, with many of whom I afterwards discussed the matter, thatthe Frenchman was careful to avoid damaging the town, and circleddirectly over the barracks on which he dropped all his bombs.  TheFreiburg papers said little about the raid, but to my surprise whenI reached Frankfurt and Cologne a week later, newspaper noticeswere still stuck about the cities calling upon Germans to witnessagain the dastardly methods of the enemy who attack the inhabitantsof peaceful towns outside of the zone of operations.The French very properly and effectively practised reprisals later,but the Germans believe that the shoe is on the other foot.  And soit is in, everything connected with the war.  The Germans tell youthat they use poisonous gas because the French used it; in fact,only their good luck in capturing some of the French gas generatorsenabled them to learn the method.  Britain, not Germany, violatesthe laws of the sea.  It was the Belgians who were cruel to Germantroops, especially the Belgian women and the Belgian children.When the Verdun offensive came to a standstill a spirit ofrestlessness developed which was reflected in the Reichstag, wherea few Social Democrats attacked the Government because theybelieved that Germany could now make peace if she wished, and thatfurther bloodshed would be for a war of conquest, advocated by theannexationists.During the succession of German military victories, especially inthe first part of the war, there was plenty of "front copy" both asnews and filler.  Some of the accounts were excellent.  The readerseldom got the idea, however, that German soldiers were beingkilled and wounded, and after a time most of the battledescriptions contained much of soft nocturnal breezes whispering inthe moonlight, but precious few real live details of fighting.Regarding this point, a German of exceptional information of theworld outside his own country expressed to me his utter amazementat the accounts appearing in the British Press of the hard life inthe trenches.  "I don't see how they hope to get men to enlist whenthey write such discouraging stuff," he said.  After the Battle ofthe Somme opened, the German newspapers used to print extracts fromthe London papers in which British correspondents vividly describedhow their own men were mown down by German machine-guns after theyhad passed them, so well was the enemy entrenched.  On thatoccasion one of the manipulators of public opinion said to me, "TheBritish Government is mad to permit such descriptions to appear inthe Press.  They will have only themselves to blame if theirsoldiers soon refuse to fight!"This is one of the many instances which I shall cite throughoutthis book to show that because the German authorities know othercountries they do not necessarily know other subjects.As weeks of war became months and months became years, thecensorship screws were twisted tighter than ever, with the resultthat docile editors were often at their wits' end to provide evenfiller.On July 14, for example, with battles of colossal magnitude ragingeast and west, the _Berliner Morgenpost_ found news so scarce thatit had to devote most of the front page to the review of a bookcalled "Paris and the French Front," by Nils Christiernssen, aSwedish writer.  I had read the book months before, as thePropaganda Department of the Foreign Office had sent it to allforeign correspondents.It became noticeable, however, that as food portions diminished,soothing-syrup doses for the public increased.   Whenever a wave ofcomplaints over food shortage began to rise the Press would build adyke of accounts of the trials of meatless days in Russia, ofEngland's scarcity of things to eat, and of the dread in France ofanother winter.  The professors writing in the Press grewparticularly comforting.  Thus on June 30 one of them comforted thepublic in a lengthy and serious article in the evening edition, ofthe _Vossische Zeitung_ with "the revelation that over-eating is acause of baldness."The cheering news of enemy privations continued to such an extentthat many Americans were asked by the more credulous if there werebread-tickets in Kew York and other American cities.  In short,Germany is being run on the principle that when you are down withsmall-pox it is comforting to know that your neighbour has cholera.The key-note of the German Press, however, has been to show thatthe war was forced on peace-loving Germany.  Of the Government'ssuccess in its propaganda among its own people I saw evidence everyday.  The people go even one step farther than the Government, forthe Government sought merely to show that it was forced to declarewar upon Russia and France.  Most of the German people arelabouring under the delusion that Russia and France actuallydeclared war on Germany.  This misconception, no doubt, is partlydue to the accounts in the German papers during the first days ofAugust, 1914, describing how the Russians and French crossed thefrontier to attack Germany before any declaration of war.A German girl who was in England at the outbreak of war, and whosubsequently returned to her own country, asked her obstinate,hard-headed Saxon uncle, a wealthy manufacturer, if Germany did notdeclare war on Russia and France.  She insisted that Germany did,for she had become convinced not only in England but in Holland.Her uncle, in a rage, dismissed the matter with: _Du bist falschunterrichtet_.  (You are falsely informed.)An American in Berlin had a clause in his apartment lease that hisobligations were abruptly and automatically terminated shouldGermany be in a state of war.  Yet when he wished to pack up and gohis German landlord took the case to court on, the ground thatGermany had not declared war.The hypnotic effect of the German newspapers on the German is notapprehended either in Great Britain or in the United States.  Thosepapers, all directed from the Foreign Office in the Wilhelmstrasse,can manipulate the thoughts of these docile people, and turn theirattention to any particular part of the war with the same celerityas the operator of a searchlight can direct his beam at any part ofthe sky he chooses.  For the moment the whole German nation looksat that beam and at nothing else.      *      *      *      *      *In the late afternoon of an autumnal day I stopped at a littlewayside inn near Hildesheim.  The place had an empty look, and thewoman who came in at the sound of my footsteps bore unmistakablelines of trouble and anxiety.No meat that day, no cheese either, except for the household.  Shecould, not even give me bread without a bread-ticket--nothing butdiluted beer.Before the war business had been good.  Then came one misfortuneafter another.  Her husband was a prisoner in Russia, and hereldest son had died with von Kluck's Army almost in sight of theEiffel Tower."You must find it hard to get along," I said."I do," she sighed.  "But, then, when fodder got scarce we killedall the pigs, so bother with them is over now.""You are not downhearted about the war?" I asked."I know that Germany cannot be defeated," she replied.  "But we doso long for peace.""You do not think your Government responsible at all for the war?"I ventured."I don't, and the rest of us do not," was her unhesitating reply."We all know that our Kaiser wanted only peace.  Everybody knowsthat England caused all this misery."  Then she looked squarely andhonestly into my eyes and said in a tone I shall never forget: "Doyou think that if our Government were responsible for the war thatwe should be willing to bear all these terrible sacrifices?"I thought of that banquet table more than two years before, and theremark about creating public opinion.  I realised that the road islong which winds from it to the little wayside inn near Hildesheim,but that it is a road on which live both the diplomat and thelonely, war-weary woman.  They live on different ends, that is all.CHAPTER VIIICORRESPONDENTS IN SHACKLESTowards the end of 1915 the neutral newspaper correspondents inBerlin were summoned to the _Kriegs-Presse-Bureau_ (War PressBureau) of the Great General Staff.  The official in charge, MajorNicolai, notified them that the German Government desired theirsignature to an agreement respecting their future activities in thewar.  It had been decided, Major Nicolai stated, to allow theAmerican journalists to visit the German fronts at more or lessregular intervals, but before this was done it would be necessaryfor them to enter into certain pledges.  These were, mainly:--1. To remain in Germany for the duration of the war, unless givenspecial permission to leave by the German authorities.2. To guarantee that dispatches would be published in the UnitedStates precisely as sent from Germany, that is to say, as editedand passed by the military censorship.3. To supply their own headlines for their dispatches, and toguarantee that these, and none others, would be printed.After labouring in vain to instruct Major Nicolai that with thebest of intentions on the part of the correspondents it was beyondtheir power to say in exactly what form the _Omaha Bee_ or the _NewOrleans Picayune_ would publish their "copy," they affixed theirsignatures to the weird document laid before them.  It was signed,without exception, by all the important correspondents permanentlystationed in Berlin.  Two or three who did not desire to hand overthe control of their personal movements to the German Governmentfor an unlimited number of years did not "take the pledge," withthe result that they were not invited to join the personallyconducted junkets to the fronts which were subsequently organised.Nothing that has happened in Germany during the war illustrates sowell the vassalage to which neutral correspondents have beenreduced as the humiliating pledges extorted from them by the GermanGovernment as the price of their remaining in Berlin for thepractice of their profession.It was undoubtedly this episode which inspired the AmericanAmbassador, Mr. Gerard, to tell the American correspondents lastsummer that they would do well to obtain their freedom from theGerman censorship before invoking the Embassy's good offices tobreak down the alleged interference with their dispatches by theBritish censorship.  When the Germans learned of the rebuff whichMr. Gerard had administered to his journalistic compatriots, theBerlin Press launched one of those violent attacks against theAmbassador to which he has constantly been subject in Germanyduring the war.As I have shown in a previous chapter the German Governmentattaches so much importance to the control and manufacture ofpublic opinion through the Press that it is drastic in theregulation of German newspapers.  It is therefore comprehensiblethat it should strive to enlist to the fullest possible extent thePress of other countries.  At least one paper in practically everyneutral country is directly subsidised by the German ForeignOffice, which does not, however, stop at this.  The attempt toseduce the newspapers of other nations into interpreting theFatherland as the Wilhelmstrasse wishes it to be interpreted leadsthe investigators to a subterranean labyrinth of schemes whichwould fill a volume.Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on June 28, 1914.  Longbefore that Dr. Hammann, head of the _Nachrichtendienst_ of theGerman Foreign Office, had organised a plan for the successfulinfluencing of the Press of the world.  In May, 1914, the work of aspecial bureau under his direction and presided over by a woman ofinternational reputation was in full operation.The following incident, which is one of the many I might cite,throws interesting light on one method of procedure.  The head ofthe special bureau asked one of the best known woman newspaperreporters of Norway if she would like to do some easy work whichwould take up very little of her time and for which she would bewell paid.The Norwegian reporter was interested and asked for particulars."Germany wishes to educate other countries to a true appreciationof things German.  Within a year, or at most within two years, weshall be doing this by sending to foreign newspapers articles whichwill instruct the world about Germany.  Of course, it is notadvisable to send them directly from our own bureau; it is muchbetter to have them appear to come from the correspondents of thevarious foreign newspapers.  Thus, we shall send you articles whichyou need only copy or translate and sign."This has been the practice in German journalism for years, and itsextension to other countries was merely a chain in the link ofGermany's deliberate and thorough preparations for the war.With a few exceptions, German reporters and correspondents areunderpaid sycophants, mere putty in the hands of the Government.Therefore, the chagrin of the officials over the independence andability of the majority of the American correspondents is easy tounderstand.  The Wilhelmstrasse determined to control them, andthrough them to influence the American Press.  Hence the rulesgiven above.When a man signs an agreement that he will not leave Germany untilthe end of the war, without special dispensation, he has boundhimself to earn his livelihood in that country.  He cannot do thiswithout the consent of the Government, for if he does not write ina manner to please them they can slash his copy, delay it, andprevent him from going on trips to such an extent that he will be afailure with his newspaper at home.  His whole success dependstherefore upon his being "good" much after the manner in which aGerman editor must be "good."  If he expresses a wish to leaveGermany before the end of the war and the wish is granted, he feelsthat a great favour has been conferred upon him and he is supposedto feel himself morally bound to be "good" to Germany in the future.The American journalistic colony in Germany is an entirelydifferent thing from what it used to be in pre-war days.  Before1914 it consisted, merely of the representatives of the AssociatedPress and United Press, half a dozen New York papers (including thenotorious _New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung_), and the well-known andimportant Western journal, the _Chicago Daily News_.  To-day manypapers published in the United States are represented in Berlin byspecial correspondents.  The influx of newcomers has been mostlyfrom German-language papers, printed in such Teutonic centres asChicago, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc.  Journals like the_Illinoiser Staats-zeitung_, of Chicago, which for years past hasbarely been able to keep its head above water, have suddenly foundthemselves affluent enough to maintain correspondents in Europewho, for their part, scorn lodgings less pretentious than those ofthe _de luxe_ Hotel Adlon in Unter den Linden.The bright star in the American journalistic firmament in Berlin isKarl Heinrich von Wiegand, the special representative of the _NewYork World_.  The _New York World_ is not pro-German, but vonWiegand is of direct and noble German origin.  Apart from hisadmitted talents as a newspaper man, his Prussian "von" is of noinconsiderable value to any newspaper which employs him.  VonWiegand, I believe, is a native of California.  Persons unfriendlyto him assert that he is really a native of Prussia, who went tothe United States when a child.  Wherever he was born, he is nowtypically American, and speaks German with an unmistakableTransatlantic accent.  He is a bookseller by origin, and his littleshop in San Francisco was wiped out by the earthquake.  Aboutforty-five years of age, he is a man of medium build, conspicuouslynear-sighted, wears inordinately thick "Teddy Roosevelteye-glasses," and is in his whole bearing a "real" Westerner ofunusually affable personality.  Von Wiegand claims, when tauntedwith being a Press agent of the German Government, that he isnothing but an enterprising correspondent of the _New York World_.I did not find this opinion of himself fully shared in Germany.There are many people who will tell you that if von Wiegand is notan actual attache of the German Press Bureau, his "enterprise"almost always takes the form of very effective Press agent work forthe Kaiser's cause.  He certainly comes and goes at all officialheadquarters in Germany on terms of welcome and intimacy, and is aclose friend of the notorious Count Reventlow.My personal opinion, however, is that he is above all a journalist,and an exceedingly able one.Von Wiegand's liaison with the powers that be in Berlin has longbeen a standing joke among his American colleagues.  Shortly afterthe fall of Warsaw in August, 1915, when the stage in Poland wasset for exhibition to the neutral world, he was roused from hisslumbers in his suite at the Adlon by a midnight telephone message,apprising him that if he would be at Friedrichstrasse Station at4.30 the next morning, with packed bags, he would be the onlycorrespondent to be taken on a staff trip to Warsaw.  Wiegand wasthere at the appointed hour, but was astonished to discover that hehad been hoaxed.  The perpetrators of the "rag" were some of his U.S. _confreres_.Von Wiegand for nearly two years has been the recipient of suchmarked and exclusive favours in Berlin that Mr. Hearst's _New YorkAmerican_ (the chief rival of the _New York World_, and the head ofthe "International News Service" which has been suppressed in GreatBritain, where it has been proved to have maliciously lied ondivers occasions) decided to send to Germany a specialcorrespondent who would also have a place in the sun.  Thegentleman appointed to crowd Mr. von Wiegand out of the limelightwas a former clergyman named Dr. William Bayard Hale, a giftedwriter and speaker, who obtained some international notoriety eightyears ago by interviewing the Kaiser.  That interview was so fullof blazing political indiscretions that the German Governmentsuppressed it at great cost by buying up the entire issue of theNew York magazine in which the explosion was about to take place.Enough of the contents of the interview subsequently leaked out toindicate that its main feature was the German Emperor's insaneanimosity to Great Britain and Japan and his determination to go towar with them.Dr. Hale also enjoyed the prestige of having once been an intimateof President Wilson.  He had written the latter's biography, andlater represented him in Mexico as a special emissary.  Shortlybefore the war he married a New York German woman, who is, Ibelieve, a sister or near relative of Herr Muschenheim, the ownerof the Hotel Astor, which in 1914 and 1915 was inhabited by theGerman propaganda bureau, or one of the many bureaus maintained inNew York City.  From the date of his German matrimonial allianceDr. Hale became an ardent protagonist of _Kultur_.  One of his lastactivities before going to Germany was to edit a huge "yellow book"which summarised "Great Britain's violations of international law"and the acrimonious correspondence on contraband and shippingcontroversies between the British and American Governments.  Thispublication was financed by the German publicity organisation andwidely circulated in the United States and all neutral countries.Dr. Hale, a tall, dark, keen-looking, smooth-shaven, andsmooth-spoken American, received in Berlin on his arrival a welcomecustomarily extended only to a new-coming foreign Ambassador.  Hecame, of course, provided with the warmest credentials CountBernstorff could supply.  Long before Hale had a chance to presenthimself at the Foreign Office, the Foreign Office presented itselfto him, an emissary from the Imperial Chancellor having, accordingto the story current in Berlin, left his compliments at Dr. Hale'shotel.  He had not been in Berlin many days before an interviewwith Bethmann-Hollweg was handed to him on a silver plate.Forthwith the _New York American_ began to be deluged with thejournalistic sweetmeats--Ministerial interviews, Departmentalstatements, and exclusive news tit-bits--with which Karl Heinrichvon Wiegand had so long and alone been distinguishing himself.I have told in detail these facts about von Wiegand and Halebecause between them the two men are able to flood the Americanpublic with a torrent of German-made news and views, whose volumeand influence are tremendous.  The _New York World's_ European newsis "syndicated" to scores of newspapers throughout the American,continent, and the service has "featured" von Wiegand's Berlindispatches to the exclusion, or at least almost to the eclipse, ofthe _World's_ other war news.  Hale's dispatches to the HearstPress have been published all the way across the Republic, not onlyin the dailies of vast circulation owned by Mr. Hearst in New York,Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, butalso in a great many other papers like the prominent _PhiladelphiaNorth American_, which subscribed to the "International NewsService."The German authorities understand all this perfectly well.  Thatexplains their unceasing attentions to von Wiegand and Hale, and toother valuable correspondents.  One of these recently undertook tocompile a book on Belgium in war-time for the purpose ofwhite-washing Germans in American estimation.  Accompanied by hiswife, he was motored and wined and dined through the conqueredcountry under the watchful chaperonage of German officers.  He hasreturned to Berlin to write his book, although it is commonknowledge there that during his entire stay in Belgium he was notpermitted to talk to a single Belgian.Although nominally catered to and fawned upon by the Germanauthorities, the American correspondents cut on the whole ahumiliating figure, although not all of them realise it.  It isnotorious they are spied upon day and night.  They are even attimes ruthlessly scorned by their benefactors in theWilhelmstrasse.  One of the Americans who essays to be independent,was some time ago a member of a journalistic party conducted toLille.  He left the party long enough to stroll into a jeweller'sshop to purchase a new glass for his watch.  While making thepurchase he asked the Frenchman who waited on him how he liked theGermans.  "They are very harsh, but just," was the reply.  A coupleof weeks later, when the correspondents were back in Berlin, MajorNicolai, of the War Press Bureau, sent for the correspondent, saidto him that he knew of the occasion on which the Americanjournalist had "left the party" in Lille, and demanded to know whathad occurred in the watchmaker's shop.   The correspondent repeatedprecisely what the Frenchman had said.  "Well," snarled MajorNicolai, "why didn't you send that to your papers?"  I may mentionhere that these parties of neutral correspondents are herded ratherthan conducted when on tour.The American correspondents had a sample of the actual contempt inwhich the German authorities hold them on the day when thecommercial submarine _Deutschland_ returned to Bremen, August 23.For purposes of glorifying the _Deutschland's_ achievement in theUnited States, the American correspondents in Berlin weredispatched to Bremen, where they were told that elaborate specialarrangements for their reception and entertainment had beencompleted.  Count Zeppelin, two airship commanders, who had justraided England, and a number of other national heroes would bepresent, together with the Grand Duke of Oldenburg at the head of agalaxy of civil, military, and naval dignitaries.  The grand climaxof the _Deutschland_ joy carnival was to be a magnificent banquetwith plenty of that rare luxury, bread and butter, at the famousBremen _Rathaus_ accompanied by both oratorical and pyrotechnicalfireworks.  The correspondents were given an opportunity to watchthe triumphal progess of the _Deutschland_ through the Weser intoBremen harbour, but at night, when they looked for their places atthe _Rathaus_ feast, they were informed that there was no room forthem.  An overflow banquet had been arranged in their specialhonour in a neighbouring tavern.  This was too much even for someof the War Press Bureau's best American friends, and the overflowdinner party was served at a table which contained many vacantchairs.  Their intended occupiers had taken the first train back toBerlin, thoroughly disgusted.It is fair to say that several of the principal Americancorrespondents in Berlin are making a serious effort to practiseindependent journalism, _but it is a difficult and hopelessstruggle_.  They are shackled and controlled from one end of theweek to the other.  They could not if they wished send theunadorned truth to the United States.  _All they are permitted toreport is that portion of the truth which reflects Germany in thelight in which it is useful for Germany to appear from time totime_.Germany has organised news for neutrals in the most intricatefashion.  A certain kind of news is doled out for the UnitedStates, a totally different kind for Spain, and still a differentbrand, when emergency demands, for Switzerland, Brazil, or China.There is a Chinese correspondent among the other "neutrals" inGermany.  The "news" prepared for him by Major Nicolai's departmentwould be very amusing reading in the columns of Mr. von Wiegand'sor Dr. Hale's papers.There is a celebrated and pro-Ally newspaper in New York whosemotto is "All the news that's fit to print." The motto of theGerman War Press Bureau is "All the news that's safe to print."CHAPTER IXANTON LANG OF OBERAMMERGAUWhile I was at home on a few weeks' visit in October, 1915, I readin the newspapers a simple announcement cabled from Europe thatAnton Lang of Oberammergau had been killed in the great Frenchoffensive in Champagne.  This came as a shock to many Americans,for the name of this wonderful character who had inspired people ofall shades of opinion and religious belief in his masterfulimpersonation of Christ in the decennial Passion Play was almost aswell known in the United States and in England as in his nativeBavaria, and better, I found than in Prussia.British and American tourist agencies had put Oberammergau on themap of the world.  The interest in America after the Passion Playof 1910 was so great, in fact, that some newspapers ran extensiveseries of illustrated articles describing it.  The man who playedthe part of Christ was idealised, everybody who had seen him likedhim, respected him and admired him.  Thousands had said thatsomehow a person felt better after he had seen Anton Lang.  As asupreme test of his popularity, American vaudeville managers askedhim to name his own terms for a theatrical tour.And now the man who had imbued his life with that of the Prince ofPeace had thrown the past aside, and with the spiked helmet inplace of the Crown of Thorns had gone to his death trying not tosave but to slaughter his fellow-men.Truly, the changes wrought by war are great!      *      *      *      *      *In Berlin I inquired into the circumstances of Anton Lang's death.Nobody knew anything definite.  Berlin knew little of him in life,much less than London, New York or Montreal.Munich is different.  There his name is a household word.  Herr vonMeinl, then Director of the Bavarian Ministry, now member of theBundesrat, told me that he believed that there was a mistake in thereport that Anton had been killed.Later, when tramping through the Bavarian Highlands, I walked onewinter day from Partenkirchen to Oberammergau, for I had a whim toknow the truth of the matter.On the lonely mountain road that winds sharply up from Oberau Iovertook a Benedictine monk who was walking to the monastery atEttal.  We talked of the war in general and of the Russianprisoners we had seen in the saw-mills at Untermberg.  I wascurious to hear his views upon the war, and I soon saw that noteven the thick walls of a monastery are proof against theidea-machine in the Wilhelmstrasse.  Despite Cardinal Mercier'sdenunciation of German methods in Belgium, this monk's views werethe same as the rest of the Kaiser's subjects.  He did, however,admit that he was sorry for the Belgians, although, in true Germanfashion, he did not consider Germany to blame.  He sighed to thinkthat "the Belgian King had so treacherously betrayed his people byabandoning his neutrality and entering into a secret agreement withFrance and Great Britain."  He recited the regular story of thesecret military letters found by the Germans after they had invadedBelgium, the all-important marginal notes of which were maliciouslyleft untranslated in the German Press.We parted at Ettal, and I pushed on down the narrow valley toOberammergau.  The road ahead was now in shadow, but behind me themountain mass was dazzling white in the rays of the setting sun."What a pity," I thought, "that the peasant must depart from thesebeautiful mountains and valleys to die in the slime of thetrenches."The day was closing in quiet and grandeur, yet all the time theshadow of death was darkening the peaceful valley of the Ammer.  Ibecame aware of it first as I passed the silent churchyard with itsgrey stones rising from the snow.  For there, on the other side ofthe old stone wall that marks the road, was a monument on which theReaper hacks the toll of death.  The list for 1870 was small,indeed, compared with that of _die grosse Zeit_.  I looked for Langand found it, for Hans had died, as had also Richard.I passed groups of men cutting wood and hauling ice and gradingroads, men with rounder faces and flatter noses than the Bavarians,still wearing the yellowish-brown uniform of Russia.  That is, mostof them wore it.  Some, whose uniforms had long since gone totatters, were dressed in ordinary clothing, with flaming red R'spainted on trousers and jackets.An old woman with a heavy basket on her back was trudging past agroup of these.  "How do you like them?" I asked.  "We shall reallymiss them when they go," she said.  "They seem part of the villagenow.  The poor fellows, it must be sad for them so far from home."Evidently the spirit of new Germany had not saturated her.I went through crooked streets, bordered with houses brightlyfrescoed with biblical scenes, to the _Pension Dahein_, the home ofthe man I wished to see.  As he rose from his pottery bench towelcome me, I felt that beneath his great blue apron and rough garbof the working man was true nobility.  I did not need to ask if hewas Anton Lang.  I had seen his picture and had often been toldthat his face was the image of His Who died on the Cross.  Iexpected much, but found infinitely more.  I felt that life hadbeen breathed into a Rubens masterpiece.  No photograph can do himjustice, for no lens can catch the wondrous light in his clear blueeyes.I was the only guest at the _Pension Daheim_; indeed, I was theonly stranger in Oberammergau.  I sat beside Anton Lang in his workroom as his steady hands fashioned things of clay, I ate at tablewith him, and in the evening we pulled up our chairs to thecomfortable fireside, where we talked of his country and of mycountry, of the Passion Play and of the war.I had been sceptical about him until I met him.  I wondered if hewas self-conscious about his goodness, or if he was a dreamer whocould not get down to the realities of this world, or if he hadbeen spoiled by flattery, or if piety was part of his profession.When I finally went from there I felt that I really understood him.His life has been without an atom of reproach, yet he never posesas pious.  He does not preach, or stand aloof, or try to make youfeel that he is better than you, but down in your heart you knowthat he is.  He has been honoured by royalty and men of state, yethe remains simple and unaffected, though quietly dignified inmanner.  He is truly Nature's Nobleman, with a mind that is pureand a face the mirror of his mind.To play well his role of _Christus_ is the dominating passion ofhis life.  Not the make-up box, but his own thoughts must mould hisfeatures for the role, which has been his in 1890, 1900 and 1910.His travels include journeys to Rome and to the Holy Land.  He iswell read, an interesting talker, and an interested listener.  Hecommented upon the great change in the spirit of the people, achange from the intoxicating enthusiasm of victory to a war-wearyfeeling of trying to hold out through a sense of duty.  To myquestion as to when he thought the war would end, he answered:"When Great Britain and Germany both realise that each must makeconcessions.  Neither can crush the other."The doctrine that "only through hate can the greatest obstacles inlife be overcome" has not reached his home, nor was there hangingon the wall, as in so many German homes, the famous order of theday of Crown Prince Rupert of Bavaria, which commences with"Soldiers of the army!  Before you are the English!" in which heexhorts his troops with all the tricky sophistry of hate.Anton Lang has worked long hard hours to bring up his family,rather than accept fabulous offers for a theatrical tour ofAmerica.  He refused these offers through no mere caprice."I admit that the temptation is great," he said to me.  "Here Imust always work hard and remain poor; there I quickly could havegrown rich.  But the Passion Play is not a business," he continuedearnestly.  "Nearly three hundred years ago, when a terrible plagueraged over the land, the people of Oberammergau vowed to AlmightyGod that if He would save their village, they would perform everyten years in His glory the Passion of His Divine Son.  The villagewas saved and Oberammergau has kept its promise.  You see, if I hadaccepted those theatrical offers I could never again live in mynative village, and that would break my heart."There is carefully preserved in the town hall at Oberammergau anold chronicle which tells of the plague.  There will undoubtedly bepreserved in the family of Lang a new chronicle, a product of thewar, printed in another country, a chronicle which did not restcontent with a notice of Anton's obituary, but told the details ofhis death in battle.Frau Lang showed me this chronicle.  She seemed to have somethingon her mind of which she wished to speak, after I told her that Iwas an American journalist.  At length one evening, after the threeyounger children bad gone to bed, and the eldest was industriouslystudying his lessons for the next day, she ventured.  "Americannewspapers tell stories which are not at all true, don't they?" shehalf stated, half asked.My natural inclination was to defend American journalism byattacking that of Germany, but something restrained me, I did notknow what.  "Of course," I explained, "in a country such as ourswhere the Press is free, evils sometimes arise.  We have all kindsof newspapers.  A few are very yellow, but the vast majority seekto be accurate, for accuracy pays in the long run inself-respecting journalism."  I thought that perhaps she wasreferring to the announcement of the death of the man who wassitting with us in the room.  We both agreed, however, that such amistake was perfectly natural since two Langs of Oberammergau hadalready been killed.  In fact, Anton had read of his own deathnotice in a Munich paper.  The American correspondent who hadcabled the news on two occasions had presumably simply "lifted" theannouncement from the German papers.  Frau Lang could understandthat very well when I explained, but how about the stories thatAnton had been serving a machine-gun, and other details which werepure fiction?She had trump cards which she played at this point.  Two gaudilycoloured "Sunday Supplements" of a certain newspaper combination inthe United States were spread before me.  The first told of howAnton Lang had become a machine-gunner of marked ability, and thathe served his deadly weapon with determination.  Could theOberammergau Passion Play ever exert the old influence again, afterthis? was the query at the end of the article.A second had all the details of Anton's death and was profuselyillustrated.  The story started with Anton going years ago into themountains to try out his voice in order to develop it for hishistrionic task.  There was a brief account of how he had followedin the path of the Prince of Peace, and of the tremendous effect hehad upon his audiences.Then came the war, which tore him from his humble home.  The battleraged, the Bavarians charged the French lines, and the spot-lightof the story was played upon a soldier from Oberammergau who laywounded in "No-Man's Land."  Another charging wave swept by thissoldier, and as he looked up he saw the face of the man he hadrespected and loved more than all other men, the face of AntonLang, the _Christus_ of Oberammergau.  The soldier covered his eyeswith his hands, for never had Anton Lang looked as he did then.The eyes which had always been so beautiful, so compassionate, hadmurder in them now.The scene shifted.  A French sergeant and private crouched by theirmachine-gun ready to repel the charge, the mutual relationshipbeing apparently somewhat that of a plumber and his assistant.They sprayed the oncoming Bavarians with a shower of steel andpiled the dead high outside the French trenches.  The charge hadfailed, and the sergeant began to act strangely.  At length hebroke the silence.  "Did you see that last _boche_, Jean?" heasked.  "Did you see that face?" Jean confessed that he did not."You are fortunate, Jean," said the sergeant.  "Never have I seensuch a face before.  I felt as if there was something supernaturalabout it.  I felt that it was wrong to kill that man.  I hated todo it, Jean.--But then the butcher was coming at us with a knifetwo feet long."I finished reading and looked up at the questioning eyes of FrauLang and at the wonderful, indescribable blue eyes of the "butcher"across the table, who, I may add, is fifty-two years of age, andhas not had a day's military training in his life."And look," said Frau Lang, "these men are not evenOberammergauers."She pointed to one of the illustrations which depicted a smallgroup of rather vicious-looking Prussians, with rifles readypeering over the rim of a trench.  The picture was labelled "Fourapostles now serving at the Front.""And see," continued the perplexed woman, "there is Johann Zwinck,the Judas in the play.  It says that he is at the front.  Why, heis sixty-nine years old, and is still the village painter.  Onlyyesterday I heard him complain that the war was making it difficultfor him to get sufficient oil to mix his paint."I was at a loss for words.  "When one compares such terribleuntruths with our German White Book," declared Frau Lang, "it isindeed difficult for the American people to understand the truesituation."I felt that it would be useless for me at that moment to explaincertain very important omissions in the German White Book.Anything would look _white_ in comparison with the yellow journal Ihad just read.  But I knew, and tried to explain that theparticular newspaper combination which printed such rubbish waswell known in America for its inaccuracies and fabrications, andalthough it was pro-German, it would sacrifice anything forsensation.  But the good woman, being a German, and consequentlyaccustomed to standardisation, could not dissociate this newspaperfrom the real Press.CHAPTER XSUBMARINE MOTIVESThe German submarines are standardised.   The draughts and blueprints of the most important machinery are multiplied and sent, ifnecessary, to twenty different factories, while all the minorstampings are produced at one or other main factory.  The"assembling" of the submarines, therefore, is not difficult.During the war submarine parts have been assembled at Trieste,Zeebrugge, Kiel, Bremerhaven, Stettin, and half a dozen otherplaces in Germany unnecessary to relate.  With commendableforesight, Germany sent submarine parts packed as machinery toSouth America, where they are being assembled somewhere on the westcoast.The improvement, enlargement, and simplification of the submarinehas progressed with great rapidity.When I was in England after a former visit to Germany I met anumber of seafolk who pooh-poohed extensive future submarining, bysaying that, no matter how many submarines the Germans might beable to produce, the training of submarine officers and crew wassuch a difficult task that the "submarine menace," as it was thencalled in England, need not be taken too seriously.The difficulty is not so great.  German submarine officers and menare trained by the simple process of double or treble banking ofthe crews of submarines on more or less active service.  Submarinecrews are therefore multiplied probably a great deal faster thanthe war destroys them.  These double or treble crews, who rarely gofar away from German waters, and are mostly trained in the safeBaltic, are generally composed of young but experienced seamen.There are, however, an increasing number of cases of soldiers beingtransferred abruptly to the U-boat service.The education of submarine officers and crew begins in thoroughGerman fashion on land or in docks, in dummy or disused submarines,accompanied by much lecture work and drill.  Submarine life is notso uncomfortable as we think.  With the exception of thedeprivation of his beer, which is not allowed in submarines, or,indeed, any form of alcohol, except a small quantity of brandy,which is kept under the captain's lock and key, Hans in hissubmarine is quite as comfortable as Johann in his destroyer.Extra comforts are forwarded to submarine men, which consist ofgramophone records (mostly Viennese waltzes), chocolate, sausages,smoked eels, margarine, cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco, a smalland treasured quantity of real coffee, jam, marmalade, and sugar.All these, I was proudly told, were extras.  There is no shortagein the German Navy.I learned nothing of value about the largest German submarines,except that everybody in Germany knew they were being built, and bythe time the gossip of them reached Berlin the impression there wasthat they were at least as large as Atlantic liners.Now as to German submarine policies.  The part that has to do withwinning the war will be dealt with in the next chapter.  But thereis also a definite policy in connection with the use of submarinesfor winning the "war after the war."The National Liberal Party, of which Tirpitz is the god, is at thehead of the vast, gradually solidifying mammoth trust, whichembraces Krupps, the mines, shipbuilding yards, and themanufactures.  Now and then a little of its growth leaks out, suchas the linking up of Krupps with the new shipbuilding.The scheme is brutally simple and is going on under the eyes of theBritish every day.  These people believe that _by building shipsthemselves and destroying enemy and neutral shipping_, they will bethe world's shipping masters at the termination of the war.  Intheir attitude towards Norwegian shipping, you will notice thatthey make the flimsiest excuse for the destruction of as muchtonnage as they can sink.  It was confidently stated to me by amember of the National Liberal Party, and by no means anunimportant one, that Germany is building ships as rapidly as sheis sinking them.  That I do not believe; but that a great part ofher effort is devoted to the construction of mercantile vessels Iascertained beyond the shadow of a doubt.I have met people in England who refuse to believe that Germany,battling on long lines east and west, and constructing withfeverish haste war vessels of every description, can findsufficient surplus energy to build ships which will not be of theslightest use until after the war is finished.  I can only say thatI personally have seen the recently completed Hamburg-Americaliners _Cap Polonio_ and _Cap Finisterre_ anchored in the Elbe offAltona.  They are beautiful boats of 20,000 and 16,000 tons, acredit to the German shipbuilding industry, which has made suchphenomenal strides in recent years.  At Stettin I passed almostunder the stem of the brand new 21,000 ton Hamburg-South Americaliner, _Tirpitz_--which for obvious business reasons may bere-named after the war.Both at Hamburg and Lubeck, where the rattle of the pneumaticriveter was as incessant as in any American city in course ofconstruction, I was amazed at the number of vessels of five or sixthousand tons which I saw being built.  Furthermore, the giantNorth German, Lloyd liner, _Hindenburg_, is nearing completion,while the _Bismarck_, of the Hamburg-America Line will be ready forher maiden trip in the early days of peace.Another part of the National Liberals' policy is the keeping aliveof all German businesses, banks and others, in enemy countries.Some people in England seem to think that the Germans are anxiousto keep these businesses alive in order to make money.  ManyGermans regard John Bull as extremely simple, but not so simple asto allow them to do that.  So long as the businesses are kept goinguntil after the war, when they can again start out with redoubledenergy, the Germans desire nothing more.  The Deutsche Bank, forexample, which bears no comparison to an English or American bank,but which is an institution for promoting both political andindustrial enterprise, is entrenched behind so powerful anAnglo-German backing in London, I was informed on many occasions,that the British Government dare not close it down.  The mixture ofspying and propaganda with banking, with export, with manufacture,seems so foreign to Anglo-Saxon ways as to be almost inconceivable.Coincident with the destruction of foreign shipping, and themaintenance of their businesses in enemy countries (England andItaly especially) is the exploitation of the coal and other mines,oil wells, and forests in occupied enemy territory.  The French andBelgian coalfields are being worked to the utmost, together withthe iron mines at Longwy and Brieux.  Poland is being deforested tosuch an extent that the climate is actually altering.It is a vast and definite scheme, with such able leaders as HerrBassermann, the real leader of the National Liberal Party, HerrStresemann, and Herr Hirsch, of Essen.  "We have powerful friends,not only in London, Milan, Rome, Madrid, New York, and Montreal,but throughout the whole of South America, and everywhere except inAustralia where that _verdammter Hooges_ (Hughes) played into thehands of our feeble, so-called leader, von Bethmann-Hollweg, bywarning the people that the British people would follow Hughes'lead."So much for the commercial part of submarining.U-boating close to England has long ceased to be a popularamusement with the German submarine flotilla, who have a thoroughlyhealthy appreciation of the various devices by which so many ofthem have been destroyed.  The National Liberals believe that theBritish will not be able to tackle long-distance submarinesoperating in the Atlantic and elsewhere.  Their radius of action isundoubtedly increasing almost month by month.  From remarks made tome I do not believe that these submarines have many land bases atgreat distances--certainly none in the United States.  They mayhave floating bases; but this I do know--that their petrol-carryingcapacity altogether exceeds that of any earlier type of submarine,and that their surface speed, at any rate in official tests, runsup to nearly 20 knots.The trip of the _Deutschland_ was not only for the purpose ofbringing a few tons of nickel and rubber, but for thoroughlytesting the new engines (designed by Maybach), for bringing back ahundred reports of the effects of submersion in such cold waters asare to be found off the banks of Newfoundland, for ascertaining howmany days' submerged or surface travelling is likely to beexperienced, and, indeed, for making such a trial trip across theAtlantic and back as was usual in the early days of steamships.CHAPTER XITHE EAGLE AND THE VULTUREAS enthusiastic, war-mad crowd had gathered about an impromptuspeaker in the Ringstrasse, not far from the Hotel Bristol, inVienna, one pleasant August evening in 1914.  His theme was themilitary prowess of Austria-Hungary and Germany."And now," he concluded, "Japan has treacherously joined ourenemies.  Yet we should not be disturbed, for her entrance will butserve to bring us another ally too.  You all know of theill-feeling between the United States and Japan.  At any moment wemay hear that the great Republic has declared war."  He called forcheers, and the Ringstrasse echoed with _Hoch! Hoch!  Hoch_! forthe United States of America.That was my introduction to European opinion of my country duringthe war.  During my four weeks in the Austro-Serbian zone ofhostilities, I had heard no mention of anything but the purelymilitary business at hand.The following evening from the window of an"American-Tourist-Special Train" I looked down on the happyAustrians who jammed the platform, determined to give the Americansa grand send-off, which they did with flag-waving and cheers.  Astranger on the platform thrust a lengthy typewritten document intomy hands, with the urgent request that I should give it to thePress in New York.  It was a stirring appeal to Americans to"witness the righteousness of the cause of the Central Powers inthis war which had been forced upon them."  Three prominentcitizens of Vienna had signed it, one of whom was the famous DoctorLorenz.Berlin, in an ecstasy of joyful anticipation of the rapid andtriumphal entrance into Paris, was a repetition of Vienna.  True,in the beginning, Americans, mistaken for Englishmen by some of theundiscerning, had been roughly treated, but a hint from those inhigh authority changed that.  In like manner, well-meaning patriotswho persisted in indiscriminately mobbing all members of the yellowrace were urged to differentiate between Chinese and Japanese.So I found festive Berlin patting Americans on the back, cheeringAmericans in German-American meetings, and prettily intertwiningthe Stars and Stripes and the German flag."Now is your opportunity to take Canada," said the man in thestreet.  In fact, it was utterly incomprehensible to the averageGerman that we should not indulge in some neighbouringland-grabbing while Britain was so busy with affairs in Europe.The German Foreign Office was, of course, under no such delusion,although it had cherished the equally absurd belief that England'scolonies would rebel at the first opportunity.  The Wilhelmstrassewas, however, hard at work taking the propaganda which it had sosuccessfully crammed down the throats of the German citizen andtranslating it into English to be crammed down the throats of thepeople in America.  This was simply one of the Wilhelmstrasse'snumerous mistakes in the psychological analysis of other people.But the Wilhelmstrasse possesses the two estimable qualities ofperseverance and willingness to learn, with the result that itsrecent propaganda in the United States has been much more subtleand very much more effective.The American newspapers which reached Germany after the outbreak ofwar gave that country its first intimation that her rush throughBelgium was decidedly unpopular on the other side of the Atlantic.Furthermore, many American newspapers depicted the Kaiser and theCrown Prince in a light quite new to German readers, who with theirheads full of Divine Right ideas considered the slightestcaricature of their imperial family as brutally sacrilegious.But the vast majority of Germans never saw an American newspaper.How is it, then, that they began to hate the United States sointensely?  The answer is simple.  In the early winter of 1914-15,the German Government with its centralised control of publicopinion turned on the current of hatred against everything Americanas it had already done against everything British, for the war hadcome to a temporary stalemate on both fronts, and theWilhelmstrasse had to excuse their failure to win the short, sharppleasant war into which the people had jumped with anticipation ofeasy victory.  "If it were not for American ammunition the warwould have been finished long ago!" became the key-note of the newgospel of hate, a gospel which has been preached down to thepresent.Just before I left Germany the "Reklam Book Company" of Leipzigissued an anti-American circular which flooded the country.  Therequest that people should enclose it in all their private letterswas slavishly followed with the same zest with which the Germanshad previously attached _Gott strafe England_ stickers to theircorrespondence.The circular represented a 7000-ton steamer ready to take on boardthe cargo of ammunition which was arranged neatly on the pier inthe foreground.  The background was occupied by German troops,black lines dividing them into three parts, taggedrespectively--30,000 _killed_, 40,000 _slightly wounded_, 40,000_seriously wounded_.  This, then, is the graphic illustration ofthe casualties inflicted upon the German Army by a single cargo ofone moderate-sized liner.Since at such a rate, it would take less than two hundred cargoesof this astoundingly effective ammunition to put the entire GermanArmy out of action, one wonders why Britain troubles herself toconvert her industries.Ere the first winter of war drew to a close the officialmanipulators of the public opinion battery had successfullyelectrified the nation into a hate against the United States secondonly to that bestowed on Great Britain.  And so it came about thatthe Government had the solid support of the people when theoriginal submarine manifesto of February 4th, 1915, warning neutralvessels to keep out of the war zone, threatened a rupture with theUnited States.  When two weeks later Washington sent a sharp noteof protest to Berlin, the Germans became choleric every time theyspoke of America or met an American."Why should we let America interfere with our plan to starveEngland?" was the question I heard repeatedly.  Their belief thatthey could starve England was absolute.  What could be simpler thanputting a ring of U-boats round the British Isles and cutting offall trade until the pangs of hunger should compel Britain to yield?I heard no talk then about the "base crime of starving women andchildren," which became their whine a year later when the knifebegan to cut the other way.In 1915 it was immaterial to the mass of Germans whether Americajoined their enemies or not.  Their training had led them to thinkin army corps, and they frankly and sneeringly asked us, "Whatcould you do?" They were still in the stage where they freelyapplied to enemies and possible enemies the expression, "They areafraid of us."  "The more enemies, the more glory," was the inanemotto so popular early in the war that it was even printed on postcards.The _Gulflight_, flying the Stars and Stripes, was torpedoed in thereign of submarine anarchy immediately inaugurated.  But two canplay most games, and when the British Navy made it increasinglydifficult for U-boats to operate in the waters near the BritishIsles, the German Foreign Office and the German Admiralty began toentertain divergent opinions concerning the advisability of pushingthe submarine campaign to a point which would drag the UnitedStates into the war.Only a few people in Germany know that von Bethmann-Hollwegstrenuously opposed the plan to sink the Lusitania.  That is, heopposed it up to a point.  The advertisement from the GermanEmbassy at Washington which appeared in American newspapers warningAmericans could not have appeared without his sanction.  In thelast days of July, 1914, backed by the Kaiser, he had opposed themobilisation order sufficient to cause a three days' delay--whichhis military opponents in German politics claim was the chief causeof the failure to take Paris--but in the case of the Lusitania hewas even more powerless against rampant militarism.For nearly a year after the colossal blunder of the Lusitania,there existed in the deep undercurrents of German politics a mostremarkable whirlpool of discord, in which the policy of von Tirpitzwas a severe tax on the patience of von Bethmann-Hollweg and theForeign Office, for it was they who had to invent all sorts ofplausible excuses to placate various neutral Powers.The Kaiser after disastrously meddling with the General Staffduring the first month of the war, subsequently took no active handin military, naval and political policies unless conflicts betweenhis chosen chieftains forced him to do so.One striking instance of this occurred when the Wilhelmstrassediscovered that Washington was in possession of information in the"_Arabic_ incident" which made the official excuses palpably toothin.  After the German authorities became convinced that theirfailure to guarantee that unresisting merchantmen would not be sunkuntil passengers and crew were removed to a place of safety wouldcause a break with the United States, Tirpitz asserted that thedisadvantages to Germany from America as an enemy would be slightin comparison with the advantages from the relentless submariningwhich in his opinion would defeat Britain.  He therefore advocatedthat no concessions be made to Washington.  Von Bethmann-Hollwegwas of the opposite opinion.  A deadlock resulted, which was brokenwhen the Kaiser summoned both men to separate and secretconferences.  He decided in favour of the Chancellor, whereuponWashington received the famous "_Arabic_ Guarantees."  It is highlysignificant that these were never made known to the German people.Then followed six months of "frightfulness," broken pledges, notes,crises, semi-crises, and finally the great crisis _de luxe_ in thecase of the _Sussex_.  When, a few days after my return to Englandfrom Germany, I used the expression "_Sussex_ Crisis" to a leadingEnglishman, he expressed surprise at the term "crisis."  "We didnot get the impression in England that the affair was a realcrisis," he said.My experiences in Germany during the last week in April and thefirst four days in May, 1916, left no doubt in my mind that I wasliving through a crisis, the outcome of which would have atremendous effect upon the subsequent course of the war.  Previousdealings with Washington had convinced the German Government aswell as the German people that the American Government would standfor anything.  Thus the extraordinary explanation of the GermanForeign Office that the Sussex was not torpedoed by a Germansubmarine, since the only U-boat commander who had fired a torpedoin the channel waters on the fateful day had made a sketch of thevessel which he had attacked, which, according to the sketch, wasnot the Sussex.The German people were so supremely satisfied with this explanationthat they displayed chagrin which quickly changed to ugliness whenthe German Press was allowed to print enough of the news fromWashington to prepare the public mind for something sharp fromacross the Atlantic.  I have seen Berlin joyful, serious, and sadduring the war; I have seen it on many memorable days; but neverhave I seen it exactly as on Saturday, April 22nd, the day when the_Sussex_ Ultimatum was made known through the Press.  The news washeadlined in the afternoon editions.  The eager crowds snapped themup, stood still in their tracks, and then one and all expressedtheir amazement to anybody near them, "President Wilson began byshaking his fist at Germany, and ended by shaking his finger," wasthe way one of the President's political opponents summarised hisNotes.  That was the opinion in Germany.  And now he had "pulled agun."  The Germans could not understand it.  When they encounteredany of the few Americans left in their country they either foamedin rage at them, or, in blank amazement, asked them what it was allabout.It was extremely interesting to the student of the war to see thatthe people really did not understand what it was all about.Theodor Wolff, the brilliant editor of the _Berliner Tageblatt_,with great daring for a German editor, raised this point in theedition in which the Ultimatum was printed.  He asserted that theGerman people did not understand the case because they purposelyhad been left in the dark by the Government.  He said, among otherthings, that his countrymen were in no position to understand thefeeling of resentment in the United States, because the meagrereports permitted in the German Press never described such detailsas the death agonies of women and children struggling helplessly inthe water.This article in the _Tageblatt_ was the striking exception to therest of the Press comment throughout Germany, for the GermanGovernment made one of its typical moves at this point.  "To climbdown or not to climb down," was a question which would take severaldays to decide.  Public opinion was already sufficiently enragedagainst America to give the Government united support in case of abreak, but it must be made more enraged and consequently moreunited.  Thus on Easter Sunday the full current of hate was turnedon in the German Press.  President Wilson was violently attackedfor working in the interest of the Allies, whom he wished to save.Germany would not bow to this injustice, she would fight, andAmerica, too, would be made to feel what it means to go to war withGermany.  The German Press did its part to inflame a united Germansentiment, and the Foreign Office, which believes in playing thegame both ways when it is of advantage to do so, withcharacteristic thoroughness did not permit the Americancorrespondents to cable to their papers the virulent lies, such asthose in the _Tagliche Rundschau_, about the affair in general andPresident Wilson in particular.  These papers were furthermore notallowed to leave Germany.On the evening preceding the publication of the Ultimatum,Maximilian Harden's most famous number of the _Zukunft_ appearedwith the title "If I Were Wilson."  On Saturday morning it wasadvertised on yellow and black posters throughout Berlin, and wasquickly bought by a feverish public to whom anything pertaining toGerman-American relations was of the sharpest interest.  Theremarkable article was directly at variance with all themanufactured ideas which had been storming in German brains formore than a year.  The British sea policy was represented in alight quite different from the officially incubated Germanconception of it.  President Wilson was correctly portrayed asstrictly neutral in all his official acts.  This staggered Harden'sreaders quite as much as his attacks on the brutal submarine policyof his country.A careless censor had allowed "If I Were Wilson," to appear.  But avigilant Government, ever watchful of the food for the minds of itschildren, hastened with the usual police methods to correct themistake.  The _Zukunft_ was _beschlagnahmt_, which means that thepolice hastily gathered up all unsold copies at the publishers,kiosks, and wherever else they were to be found.  If a policemansaw one in a man's pocket he took it away.Why did the Government do everything in its power to suppress thisarticle?  The Government fully understood that there was nothing init that was not true, nothing in it of a revolutionary character.It divulged no military or naval secrets.  It was a simplestatement of political truths.  But the German great Idea Factoryin the Wilhelmstrasse does not judge printed matter from its truthor falsity.  The forming of the public mind in the mould in whichit will best serve the interests of the State is the soleconsideration.  While the Directors of Thought were deliberating onthe relative disadvantages of a curtailment of submarine activityand America as an enemy, and the order of the day was to instillhatred, no matter how, they decided that it would be inadvisablefor the people to read the true statements of Harden.One American correspondent began to cable five thousand words of"If I Were Wilson" to his paper.  The Censor stopped him after hehad sent thirteen hundred.  A rival correspondent, when he glancedat the article immediately after it had appeared, decided that itwas more suitable for mail matter than cable matter, put it in anenvelope, and actually scored a scoop over all opponents.During the following days, when the leaders of Germany were inconference at the Headquarters of the General Staff, I travelled asmuch as possible to find out German sentiment.  The people wereintoxicated with the successes against Verdun, and were angrily infavour of a break.  One German editor said to me "The Governmenthas educated them to believe that the U-boat can win the war.Their belief is so firm that it will be difficult for theauthorities to explain a backdown to Wilson."It was not.  The Government can explain anything to the Germanpeople.  The back-down came, causing sentiments which can bedivided into three groups.  One, "We were very good to give in toAmerica.  England would not be so good."  Two, "Americans put us ina bad position.  To curtail our submarine weapon means alengthening of the war.  On the other hand, to add America to thelist of our enemies would lengthen the war still more."  Three, "Weshall wait our opportunity and pay back America for what she hasdone to us."  I heard the latter expression everywhere,particularly among the upper classes.  It was the expression ofDoctor Drechsler, head of the Amerika-Institut in Berlin, and oneof the powerful propaganda triumvirate composed of himself, DoctorBertling, and the late Professor Munsterberg.With the increasing deterioration inside the German Empire theresolve of the Chancellor to avoid a clash with the United Statesstrengthened daily.  His opponents, however, most of the greatAgrarians and National Liberals, the men behind Tirpitz, continueto work for a new submarine campaign in which all neutrals will bewarned that their vessels will be sunk without notice if bound toor from the ports of Germany's enemies.  They are practical men,who believe that only through the unrestricted use of the submarinecan Britain, whom they call the keystone of the opposition, bebeaten.  The Chancellor is also a practical man, who believes thatthe entrance of America on the side of the Entente would seal thefate of Germany.  He is supported by Herr Helfferich, theVice-Chancellor, and Herr Zimmermann, the foreign Secretary, menwith a deep insight into the questions of trade and treaties.  Theybelieve that peace will be made across the table and not at thepoint of the sword, and they realise that it is much better forGermany not to have the United States at the table as an enemy.In September, 1916, the Chancellor began to lay the wires for a newcampaign, a campaign to enlist the services of Uncle Sam in a movefor peace.  It is significant, however, that he and his Governmentcontinue to play the game both ways.  While Germany presses herofficial friendship on the United States, and conducts propagandathere to bring the two nations closer together, she at the sametime keeps up the propaganda of hate at home against America, inorder to have the support of the people in case of emergency.The attacks against Washington in the _Continental Times_ showwhich way the wind blows, for this paper is subsidised by theGerman Foreign Office through the simple device of buying 30,000copies of each issue--it appears three times weekly--at 2 1/2d.per copy.  The editors are Aubrey Stanhope, an Englishman who evenbefore the war could not return to his native country for reasonsof his own, and R. L. Orchelle, whose real name is HermannScheffauer, who claims to be an American, but is not known as suchat the American Embassy in Berlin.  He has specialised in attacksagainst Great Britain in the United States.  Some of the viciousonslaughts against Washington in Germany were made by him.American flags are scarce in Berlin to-day, but one always wavesfrom the window of 48, Potsdamerstrasse.  It is a snare for theunwary, but the League uses it here as in countless other instancesas a cloak for its warfare against the U.S.A.The League started early in the war by issuing booklets by the tonfor distribution in Germany and America.  Subscription blanks werescattered broadcast for contributions for the cause of light andtruth.  Donations soon poured in, some of them very large, fromGermans and German-Americans who wished, many of them sincerely, tohave what they considered the truth told about Germany.The ways of the League, however, being crooked, some of the chartermembers began to fall away from one another and many of the doingsof the ringleaders are now coming to light.The League must be doing well financially, as William Martin, thechief of the Potsdamerstrasse office, jubilantly declared that nomatter how the war ended he would come out of it with a million.Any real American, whether at home or abroad, deeply resents thedegradation of his flag.  Yet the League of Truth in Berlin hasconsistently dragged the Stars and Stripes in the mire, and that ina country which boasts that the police are not only omniscient butomnipotent.A constant attempt, in accordance with the policy of most Germannewspapers, I may add, is made to depict us as a spinelessjelly-fish nation.  They have regarded principles of internationalcustom as little as the manipulators of submarines under the reignof Tirpitz.Last fourth of July, Charles Mueller, a pseudo-American, hung fromhis home in the busy Kurfurstendamm a huge American flag with adeep border of black that Berlin might see a "real American's"symbol of humiliation.  On the same day, dear to the hearts ofAmericans, a four-page flyer was spread broadcast through theGerman capital with a black border on the front page enclosing ablack cross.  The Declaration of Independence was bordered withblack inside and an ode to American degradation by John L. Stoddardcompleted the slap in the face.The League selected January 27th, 1916, the Kaiser's birthday, as asuitable occasion for Mueller and Marten, not even hyphenates,solemnly and in the presence of a great crowd to place an immensewreath at the base of the statue of Frederick the Great on theLinden, with the inscription "Wilson and his Press are not America."The stern Police Department of Berlin does not permit thepromiscuous scattering of floral decorations and advertising matteron the statues of German gods, and the fact that the wreathremained there month after month proved that somebody high up wassanctioning the methods of the League.The protests of the American Ambassador were of no avail, until hedetermined to make an end of the humiliation, after three months,by threatening to go down to this busy section of Berlin, near theRoyal Palace, and remove the wreath himself.  Force is the onlyargument which impresses the Prussians, and we are extremelyfortunate that our Ambassador to Germany is a man of force.The League, however, had printed a picture of the wreath in itsissue of _Light and Truth_, which it endeavours to circulateeverywhere.Stoddard, mentioned above, is the famous lecturer.  He has writtenbooklets for the League, one of which I read in America.  His lastpamphlet, however, is a most scurrilous attack against his country.He raves against America, and, after throwing the facts ofinternational law to the winds, he shrieks for the impeachment ofWilson to stop this slaughter for which he has sold himself.It is no secret in Berlin that the League have systematicallyhounded Mr. Gerard.  I do not know why they hate him, unless it isbecause he is a member of the American Government.  I have heard itsaid that one way to get at Wilson was through his Ambassador.Their threats and abuse became so great that he and one of theAmerican newspaper correspondents went to 48, Potsdamerstrasseduring the _Sussex_ crisis to warn the leaders.  They answered byswearing out a warrant against Mr. Gerard with the Berlinpolice--paying no heed to international customs in suchmatters--and circulating copies of the charge broadcast.Readers who are familiar with Germany know that if a man does notinstantly defend himself against _Beleidigung_ society judges himguilty.  Thus this and countless other printed circulations offalsehood against Mr. Gerard have cruelly hurt him throughoutGermany, as I know from personal investigation.  Next to Mr. Wilsonand a few men in England he is the most hated man among the Germanpeople.  He finally felt obliged to deny in the German Press someof the absurd stories circulated about him, such as that of Mrs.Gerard putting a German decoration he received on her dog.Mueller, however, was not content with mere printed attacks, buthas made threats against the life of the American Ambassador.  Aprominent American has sworn an affidavit to this effect, butMueller still pursues his easy way.  On the night that the farewelldinner was being given to a departing secretary at our Embassy,Mueller and a German officer went about Berlin seeking Mr. Gerardfor the professed purpose of picking a fight with him.   They wentto Richards' Restaurant, where the dinner was being given, butfortunately missed the Ambassador.The trickery of the League would fill a volume, for Martenespecially is particularly clever.  He leapt into fame in Berlin bygoing to Belgium "at his own risk," as he says, to refute thecharges of German cruelty there.  His book on Belgium, and a laterone claiming to refute the Bryce report, are unimpressive sincethey fail to introduce facts, and the writer contents himself forthe main part with soliloquies on Belgian battlefields, in which heattacks Russian aggression and Britain's perfidy in entering thewar.  The Belgians, we gather, are more or less delighted with thechange from Albert to Wilhelm.Marten prints testimonials of the book from leading Germans, mostof whom, such as General Falkenhayn, content themselves withacknowledgment of receipt with thanks and statement of having readthe work.  Count Zeppelin goes further, and hopes that the volumewill find a wide circulation, particularly in neutral countries.And now for the vice-president of this anti-American organisation.He is St. John Gaffney, former American Consul-General to Munich.He belongs to the modern martyr series of the German of to-day.All over Germany I was told that he was dismissed by Mr. Wilsonbecause he sympathised with Germany.  The Germans as a mass knownothing further, but I can state from unimpeachable authority thathe used rooms of the American Hospital in Munich, while a member ofthe board of that hospital and an officer in the consular serviceof the United States, for propaganda purposes.  His presence becameso objectionable to the heads of the hospital, excellent peoplewhose sole aim is to aid suffering humanity, that he was ousted.He returned from his American trip after his dismissal last yearand gave a widely quoted interview upon arrival in Germany whichsought to discredit America--through hitting Mr. Wilson and thePress--in the most tense point of our last altercation in Februarywith Germany over the Lusitania.  Such men as Gaffney are greatlyto blame for many German delusions.Mr. Gerard is not the only official whose path has not been strewnwith roses in Germany.  Our military attache has not been permittedto go to the German front for nearly a year, and the snub isapparent in the newspaper and Government circles of Berlin.  He isprobably the only one left behind.The big Press does not use League of Truth material and certainother anti-American copy which would be bad for Germany, to reachforeign critics' attacks.  Many provincial papers, however,furiously protested against the recent trip of the Americanmilitary attache through industrial Germany.  It was only theAmerican, not other foreign attaches, to whom they objected.All this is useful to the German Government, for it keeps thepopulace in the right frame of mind for two purposes.  In the firstplace, a hatred of America inspired by the belief that she isreally an enemy, gives the German Government greater power over thepeople.  Secondly, should the Wilhelmstrasse decide to play therelentless submarine warfare as its last hand it will havepractically united support.CHAPTER XIIIN THE GRIP OF THE FLEETThere is only one way to realise the distress in Germany, and thatis to go there and travel as widely as possible--preferably onfoot.  The truth about the food situation and the growingdiscontent cannot be told by the neutral correspondent in Germany.It must be memorised and carried across the frontier in the brain,for the searching process extends to the very skin of thetraveller.  If he has an umbrella or a stick it is likely to bebroken for examination.  The heels are taken from his boots lestthey may conceal writings.  This does not happen in every case, butit takes place frequently.  Many travellers are in addition givenan acid bath to develop any possible writing in invisible ink.In Germany, as it is no longer possible to conceal the actual stateof affairs from any but highly placed and carefully attendedneutrals travelling therein, the utmost pains are being taken tomislead the outside world.  The foreign correspondents are notallowed to send anything the Government does not wish to get out.They are, moreover, regularly dosed with propaganda distributed bythe _Nachrichtendienst_ (Publicity Service of the Foreign Office).One of the books handed round to the neutrals when I was in Berlinwas a treatise on the German industrial and economic situation byProfessor Cassell, of the University of Upsala, Sweden.He came upon the invitation of the German authorities for a threeweeks' study of conditions.  In his preface he artlessly mentionsthat he was enabled to accomplish so much in three weeks owing tothe praiseworthy way in which everything was arranged for him.  Hecompiled his work from information discreetly imparted atinterviews with officials, from printed statistics, and fromobservations made on carefully shepherded expeditions.   Neutralcorrespondents are expected to use this sort of thing, which isturned out by the hundredweight, as the basis of theircommunications to their newspapers.  We were supplied with asimilar volume on the "Great German naval victory of Jutland."One feels in Germany that the great drama of the war is the dramaof the food supply--the struggle of a whole nation to preventitself being exhausted through hunger and shortage of raw materials.After six months of war the bread ticket was introduced, whichguaranteed thirty-eight ordinary sized rolls or equivalent eachweek to everybody throughout the Empire.  In the autumn of 1915Tuesday and Friday became meatless days.  The butter lines hadbecome an institution towards the close of the year.  There waslittle discomfort, however.For seventeen months Germany laughed at the attempt to starve herout.  Then, early in 1916 came a change.  An economic decline wasnoticeable, a decline which was rapid and continuous during eachsucceeding month.  Pork disappeared from the menu, beef becamescarcer and scarcer, but veal was plentiful until April.  In March,sugar could be obtained in only small quantities, six months laterthe unnutritious saccharine had almost completely replaced it.Fish continued in abundance, but became increasingly expensive.  Ashortage in meat caused a run on eggs.  In September egg cardslimited each person to two eggs per week, in December the maximumbecame one egg in two weeks.  Vegetables, particularly cabbage andturnips, were plentiful enough to be of great help.In Berlin the meat shortage became so acute in April, 1916, thatfor five days in the week preceding Easter most butchers' shops didnot open their doors.  This made it imperative that the city shouldextend the ticket rationing system to meat.  The police issuedcards to the residents of their districts, permitting them topurchase one-half pound of meat per week from a butcher to whomthey were arbitrarily assigned in order to facilitate distribution.The butchers buy through the municipal authorities, who contractfor the entire supply of the city.  The tickets are in strips, eachof which represents a week, and each strip is subdivided into fivesections for the convenience of diners in restaurants.Since the supply in each butcher's shop was seldom sufficient tolet everybody be served in one day, the custom of posting in thewindows or advertising in the local papers "Thursday, Nos. 1-500,"and later, "Saturday, Nos. 501-1000," was introduced.  A fewbutchers went still further and announced at what hours certainnumbers could be served, thus doing away with the long queues.Most of the competent authorities with whom I discussed the matteragreed that the great flaw in the meat regulations was that, unlikethose of bread, they were only local and thus there were greatdifferences and correspondinng discontent all over Germany.One factor which contributed to Germany's shortage of meat was theindiscriminate killing of the livestock, especially pigs, when theprice of fodder first rose in the last months of 1914.  Most ofthis excess killing was done by the small owners.  Our plates wereheaped unnecessarily.  Some of the dressing was done so hurriedlyand carelessly that there were numerous cases of pork becoming sofull of worms that it had to be destroyed.The great agrarian Junkers were not forced by lack of fodder tokill; consequently they own a still larger proportion of thelive-stock than they did at the beginning of the war.On October 1st, 1916, the regulation of meat was taken out of thehands of the local authorities so far as their power to regulatethe amount for each person was concerned, and this amount was madepractically the same throughout Germany.First and foremost in the welfare of the people, whatever may besaid by the vegetarians, is the vital question of the meat supply.Involved in the question of cattle is milk, leather, otherproducts, and of course, meat itself.One German statistician told me he believed that the conquest ofRoumania would add between nine and ten months to Germany'scapacity to hold out, during which time, no doubt, one or other ofthe Allies would succumb.At the beginning of 1917 the actual number of cattle in Germanydoes not seem to be so greatly depreciated as one would expect.After a very thorough investigation I am convinced that there arein Germany to-day from three-fourths to four-fifths as many head ofcattle as there were before the war.In the spring and summer these cattle did very well, but with thepassing of the grazing season new difficulties are arising.  Cattlemust be fed, and unless sufficient grain comes from Roumania tosupply the bread for the people and the fodder for the cattle it isobvious that there must be a wholesale slaughtering, and consequentreduction of milk, butter, and cheese.All these details may seem tiresome, but they directly concern thelength of the war.To add to the shortage, the present stock of cattle in Germany was,when I left, being largely drawn upon for the supply of the Germanarmies in the occupied parts of Prance, Belgium, and Russia, andthe winter prospect for Germany, therefore, is one of obviouslyincreased privation, provided always that the blockade is drastic.Cattle are, of course, not the only food supply.  There is game.Venison is a much commoner food in Germany than in England,especially now there is much of it left.  Hares, rabbits,partridges are in some parts of Germany much more numerous eventhan in England.  A friend of mine recently arrived from Hungarytold me that he had been present at a shoot over driven partridgesat which, on three successive days, over 400 brace fell to theguns.  Wherever I went in Germany, however, game was being netted.Before the war, pork, ham, and bacon were the most popular Germanfood, but owing to the mistake of killing pigs in what I heardcalled the "pork panic" the Germans are to-day facing a remarkableshortage of their favourite meat.  I am convinced that they began1917 with less than one-fourth as many pigs as they had before thewar.The Berlin stockyards slaughtered over 25,000 pigs weekly beforeAugust, 1914.  During the first 10 months of the war the figureactually rose to 50,000 pigs per week in that one city alone.  Inone week in September last the figure had fallen to 350 pigs!The great slaughter early in the war gave a false optimism not onlyto Germans, but also to visitors.  If you have the curiosity tolook back at newspapers of that time you will find that the greatplenty of pork was dilated upon by travelling neutrals.To-day the most tremendous efforts are being made to increase thenumber of pigs.  You will not find much about this in the Germannewspapers--in fact what the German newspapers do not print isoften more important than what they do print.  In the ruraldistricts you can learn much more of Germany's food secrets than inthe newspapers.In one small village which I went to I counted no fewer than thirtypublic notices on various topics.  Hers is one:--  FATTEN PIGS.  Fat is an essential for soldiers and hard workers.  Not to keep and fatten pigs  if you are able to do so is treason to the Fatherland.  No pen empty--every pen full.These food notices may be necessary, but they are bringing aboutintense class hatred in Germany.  They are directed at the smallfarmer, who in many cases has killed all his pigs and most of hiscows, because of his difficulty in getting fodder.  As I have said,the great agrarian junkers, the wealthy landowners of Prussia, havein many cases more cows, more pigs, more poultry than before thewar.The facts of these great disparities of life are well known, and ifthere were more individuality in the German character they wouldlead to something more serious than the very tame riots, at severalof which I have been present.That the food question is the dominating topic in Germany among allexcept the very rich, and that this winter will add to theintensity of the conversations on the subject, is not difficult tounderstand.  Most of the shopping of the world is done by women,and the German woman of the middle class, whose maidservant hasgone off to a munition factory, has to spend at least half her daywaiting in a long line for potatoes, butter, or meat.There is a curious belief in England and in the United States inthe perfection of German organisation.  My experience of theirorganisation is that it is absolutely marvellous--when there are nounexpected difficulties in the way.  When the Germans first put thenation on rations as to certain commodities, the outside worldsaid, "Ah, they are beginning to starve!" or "What wonderfulorganisers!"As a matter of fact, they were not beginning to starve, and theywere not wonderful organisers.  The rationing was done about asbadly as it could be done.  It was arranged in such a fashion as toproduce plenty in some places and dearth in others.  It was done sothat wealthy men made fortunes and poor men were made still poorer.The inordinate greed and lack of real patriotism on the part ofinfluential parties in both Germany and Austria-Hungary have addedto the bad state of affairs.  As if to make matters worse, thewhole vast machine of rationing by ticket was based on theexpectation of a comparatively quick and decisive victory forGermany.  This led to reckless consumption and a great rise inprices.  The fight that is now going on between the masses in thetowns and the wealthy land-owning farmers has been denounced inpublic by food dictator Batocki (pronounced Batoski), who, in wordsalmost of despair, complained of the selfish landed proprietor, whowould only disgorge to the suffering millions in the greatmanufacturing centres at a price greatly exceeding that fixed bythe food authorities.All manner of earnest public men are endeavouring to cope with thecoming distress, and at this point I can do no better than quotefrom an interview given me by Dr. Sudekum, Social Democratic memberof the Reichstag for Nuremberg, Bavaria.  He is a sincere patriot,and a prominent worker in food organisation."More than a year ago," he explained, "I worked out a plan for thedistribution of food, which provided for uniform food-cardsthroughout the entire empire.  For example, everyone, whether helived in a Bavarian village or in a Prussian city, would receive,say, half a pound of meat a week.  I presented my plan to theGovernment, with whose approval it met.  Nevertheless, they did notsee fit to adopt it for three reasons.  In the first place becausethey believed that the people might become unnecessarily alarmed.Secondly, because our enemies might make capital out of suchmeasures.  _Thirdly, because our leaders at that time believed thatthe war might be over before the end of 1915_."But the war dragged on, and we were somewhat extravagant with oursupplies--I except bread, for which we introduced cards inFebruary, 1915--and instead of the whole Empire husbanding thedistribution of meat, for example, various sections here and thereintroduced purely local measures, with the inevitable resultingconfusion."Hunger has been a cause of revolution in the past," Dr. Sudekumcontinued thoughtfully.  "We should take lessons from history, anddo everything in our power to provide for the poor.  I have workedhard in the development of the 'People's Kitchens' in Berlin.  Westarted in the suburbs early in 1916, in some great centralkitchens in which we cook a nourishing meat and vegetable stew.From these kitchens distributing vehicles--_Gulasch-kanonen_ (stewcannons) as they are jocularly called--are sent through, the city,and from them one may purchase enough for a meal at less than thecost of production.  We have added a new central kitchen each weekuntil we now have 30, each of which supplies 10,000 people a daywith a meal, or, more correctly, a meal and a half.  In July,however, the work assumed greater proportions, for the municipalauthorities also created great central kitchens.  Most of thedinners are taken to the homes and eaten there."The People's Kitchen idea is now spreading throughout Germany.But I believe in going further, I believe in putting everyGerman--I make no exception--upon rations.  That is what is done ina besieged city, and our position is sufficiently analogous to abesieged city to warrant the same measures.  All our food wouldthen be available for equal distribution, and each person would gethis allowance."This earnest Social Democrat's idea is, of course, perfect intheory.  Even the able, hard-working Batocki, however, cannot makeit practicable.  Why not?  _The Agrarian, the great Junker ofPrussia_, not only will not make sacrifices, but stubbornly insistsupon wringing every pfennig of misery money from the nation whichhas boasted to the world that its patriotism was unselfish andunrivalled.The most important German crop of all at this juncture is potatoes,for potatoes are an integral part of German and Austrian bread.The handling of the crop, to which all Germany was looking forwardso eagerly, exhibits in its most naked form the horrid profiteeringto which the German poor are being subjected by the German rich.It was a wet summer in Germany.  Wherever I went in my ruralexcursions I heard that the potatoes were poor.  The people in thetowns knew little of this, and were told that the harvests weregood.An abominable deception was practised upon the public with thefirst potato supply.  For many months tickets had been in use forthis food, which is called the "German staff of life."  Suddenlyofficial notices appeared that potatoes could be had for a few dayswithout tickets, and the unsuspecting public at once ordered greatquantities.The Agrarians thus got rid of all their bad potatoes to the mass ofthe people.  In many cases they were rotting so fast that thepurchaser had to bury them.  It was found that they producedillness when given to swine.What other people in the world than the Germans would stand that?But they did stand it.  "These are only the early potatoes--themain crop will be all right," said the profiteers right and left,and gradually the masses began to echo them, as is usual in Germany.Well, the main crop has been gathered, and Food Dictator vonBatocki is, according to the latest reports I hear from Germany,unable to make the Agrarians put their potatoes upon the marketeven at the maximum price set by the Food Commission.They are holding back their supplies until they have forced up themaximum price, just as a year ago many of them allowed theirpotatoes to rot rather than sell them to the millions in the citiesat the price set by law.Some Germans, mostly Social Democratic leaders, declare that sincetheir country is in a state of siege, the Government should, beyondquestion, commandeer the supplies and distribute them, but just asthe industrial classes have, until quite recently, resisted wartaxes, so do the Prussian Junkers, by reason of their power in theReichstag, snap their fingers at any suggested fair laws for fooddistribution.The Burgomaster--usually a powerful person in Germany--is helpless.When on September 1 the great house-to-house inventory of foodsupplies was taken, burgomasters of the various sections of GreaterBerlin took orders from the people for the whole winter supply ofpotatoes on special forms delivered at every house.  Up to the timeI left, the burgomasters were unable to deliver the potatoes,Any dupes of German propaganda who imagine that there is muchself-sacrifice among the wealthy class in Germany in this warshould disabuse their minds of that theory at once.  While the poorare being deprived of what they have, the purchases of pearls,diamonds, and other gems by the profiteers are on a scale neverbefore known in Germany.One of the paradoxes of the situation, both in Austria and inGermany, is the coincidence of the great gold hunt, which isclearing out the trinkets of the humblest, with the roaring tradein jewelry in Berlin and Vienna.  As an instance I can vouch forthe veracity of the following story:--A Berlin woman went to Werner's, the well-known jewellers in theUnter den Linden, and asked to be shown some pearl necklaces.After very little examination she selected one that cost 40,000marks (2,000 pounds).  The manager, who knew the purchaser as aregular customer for small articles of jewelry, ventured to expresshis surprise, remarking, "I well remember, madam, that you havebeen coming here for many years, and that you have never boughtanything exceeding in value 100 marks.  Naturally I am somewhatsurprised at the purchase of this necklace."  "Oh, it is verysimple," she replied.  "My husband is in the leather business, andour war profits have made us rich beyond our fondest hopes."Throughout Austria and Germany in every village and townlet areappearing notices to bring in gold.The following notice is to be met with in all parts of Germany:--LET EVERY ONE WORTHY OF THE NAME OF GERMAN DO HIS DUTY NOW.Our enemies, after realising that they cannot defeat us on thefield of battle, are striving to defeat us economically.  But herethey will also fail.OUT WITH YOUR GOLD.Out with your gold!  What is the value of a trinket to the life ofthe dear one that gave it?  By giving now you may save the life ofa husband, brother, or son.Bring your gold to the places designated below.  If the value ofthe gold you bring exceeds five marks, you will receive an ironmemento of "Die grosse Zeit."Iron chains will be given for gold chains.  _Wedding rings of thosestill living will not be accepted_.From rural pulpits is preached the wickedness of retaining goldwhich might purchase food for the man in the trenches.The precedent of the historic great ladies of Prussia who exchangedtheir golden wedding rings for rings of iron is drummed into thesmaller folk continuously.  The example is being followed by theexchange of gold trinkets for trinkets made of iron, with theaddition of the price paid at the central collecting station--paid,of course, in paper, which is at a 30 per cent. discount in Germanyand 47 per cent. discount in Austria.  Every bringer of a trinketworth more than 5s. receives a small iron token of "_die grosseZeit_" (the great epoch).The gold hunt has revealed unexpected possessions in the hands ofthe German and Austrian lower classes.  To me it was pathetic tosee an old woman tremblingly handing over treasures that had comedown probably for two or three generations--treasures that hadnever been worn except on high days and festivals, weddings, andperhaps on the day of the local fair.  Particularly sad is thisself-sacrifice in view of the gigantic profits of the food usurersand war profiteers.  The matter is no secret in Germany or Austria.It is denounced by the small Socialist minority in the Reichstag,to whose impotence I have often referred.  It is stoutly defendedin good Prussian fashion by those openly making the profits.There has arisen a one-sided Socialism which no one but Bismarck'sfamous "nation of lackeys" would tolerate.  At the top is a narrowcircle of agrarian and industrial profiteers, often belonging tothe aristocratic classes.  At the other end of the scale is, forexample, the small farmer, who has now absolutely nothing to sayconcerning either the planting, the marketing, or the selling ofhis crops.  Regulations are laid down as to what he should sow,where he should sell, and the price at which he should sell.Unlike the Junker, he has not a long purse.  He _must sell_.What state of mind does this produce among the people?  I know thatoutside Germany there is an idea that every German is working attop speed with the spirit of the Fatherland flaming him on.  Thatwas the spirit I witnessed in the early days of the war, whenGermany was winning and food was plentiful.In certain rural districts as well as in centres of populationthere is an intense longing for peace--not merely for a Germanpeace--but any peace, and a peace not merely for military reasons,but arising out of utter weariness of the rule of the profiteersand the casualties not revealed by the doctored lists--ingeniouslyissued lists, which, for example, have never revealed the loss of asubmarine crew, though intelligent Hamburg shipping people, who arein close touch with German naval people, estimate the loss ofGerman submarines as at least one hundred.  I have heard the figureput higher, and also lower.This kind of one-sided Socialism makes the people so apathetic thatin some parts of Germany it has been very difficult to induce themto harvest their own crops, and in German Poland they have beenforced to garner the fields at the point of the bayonet.When a man has no interest in the planting, marketing, and sellingprice of his produce; when he knows that what he grows may be sweptaway from his district without being sure that it will be of anybenefit to himself and his family; when, in addition, the father orsons of the households lie buried by the Yser, the Somme, the Meuseor the Drina, it is impossible for the authorities to inspire anyenthusiasm for life, let alone war, even among so docile a peopleas those they deal with.      *      *      *      *      *With regard to the other crops, rye is good; beets look good, butare believed to be deficient in sugar owing to the absence of SouthAmerican fertilisers; wheat is fairly good; oats extremely good,and barley also excellent.  The Germans have boasted to the neutralvisitor that their artificial nitrates are just as good fertilisersas those imported from South America.  It is true that they do verywell for most crops when the weather is damp.  But beets, strangelyenough, require the genuine Chilean saltpetre to produce theirmaximum of sugar.  The failure to get this, plus the use of sugarin munition making, accounts for the dearth of that commodity amongthe civilian population.In order that nothing shall be wasted, the Government decreed thisyear that the public should be allowed to scavenge the fields afterthe harvest had been gathered, and this was a source of somebenefit to those residing near the great centres of population.Schoolmasters were also ordered to teach the children the need ofgathering every sort of berry and nut.Passing along an English hedgerow the other day, and seeing itstill covered with withered blackberries, I compared them with thebare brambles which I saw in Germany from which all berries havegone to help the great jam-making business which is to eke out thegradually decreasing butter and margarine supply.  Sickness anddeath have resulted from mistakes made, not only in gatheringberries, but in gathering mushrooms and other fungi, which havebeen keenly sought.It is safe to say that the Germans are leaving no stone unturned toavoid the starvation of the Seven Years' War.  The ingenuity of thechemists in producing substitutes was never greater.  One of themost disagreeable foods I have tasted was bread made of straw.Countless experiments have been made in the last year to adaptstraw to the human stomach, but although something resembling breadhas been produced, it contains almost no nourishment and results inillness.People who reside in the cities and carefully shepherded visitingneutrals, who do not go into the country, have little notion of theterrific effort being put forward to make the fruits of MotherEarth defeat the blockade, and _above all_ to extract any kind of_oil_ from anything that grows.Here is one notice:--  HOW THE CIVIL POPULATION CAN HELP IN THE WAR.  Our enemies are trying to exhaust us, but they  cannot succeed if every one  does his duty.  OIL _is a Necessity_.  You can help the Fatherland if you plant  poppies, castor plant, sunflowers.  In addition to doing important work for  the Fatherland you benefit yourself  because the price for oil is high.I may say that the populace have responded.  Never have I seen suchvast fields of poppies, sunflowers, rape plant, and otheroleaginous crops.  Oil has been extracted from plum-stones,cherry-stones, and walnuts.The Government have not pleased the people even in this matter.One glorious summer day, after tramping alone the sandy roads ofSouthern Brandenburg, I came to a little red-brick village in themidst of its sea of waving rye and blaze of sunflowers and poppies.Taking my seat at the long table in front of the local _Gasthaus_,and ordering some imitation coffee--the only refreshment providedin the absence of a local bread ticket--I pointed out one of thesenotices to the only other person at the table, who was drinkingsome "extraordinarily weak beer," as he put it.  "Have the peoplehere planted much of these things I see on that notice?" I asked,pointing to one of the placards.  "Yes," he said, "certainly.  Agreat deal; but the Government is going to be false to us again.It will be commandeered at a price which they have already set."Then came the usual string of grumbles which one hears everywherein the agricultural districts.   I will not repeat them.  They allhave to do with the food shortage, profiteering, and discontent atthe length of the war.Though all Germans, with the exception of a few profiteers, aregrumbling at the length of the war, it must not be supposed thatthey have lost hope.  In fact their grumblings are punctuatedfrequently by very bright hopes.   When Douaumont fell, foodtroubles were forgotten.  The bells rang, the flags were unfurled,faces brightened, crowds gathered before the maps and discussed theearly fall of Verdun and the collapse of France.  Again I heard onevery hand the echo of the boasts of the first year of the war.The glorious manner in which France hurled back the assault wasmaking itself felt in Germany with a consequent depression overfood shortage when the greatest naval victory in history--so wegathered, at least, from the first German reports--raised thespirits and hopes of the people so high that they fully believedthat the blockade had been smashed.  On the third day of thecelebration, Saturday, June 3rd, I rode in a tram from Wilmersdorf,a suburb of Berlin, to the heart of the city through miles ofstreets flaring with a solid mass of colour.  From nearly everywindow and balcony hung pennants and flags; on every trolley polefluttered a pennant of red, white and black.  Even the ancienthorse 'buses rattled through the streets with the flags of Germanyand her allies on each corner of the roof.  The newspapers screamedheadlines of triumph, nobody could settle down to business, thefaces one met were wreathed in smiles, complaining was forgotten,the assurance of final victory was in the very air.Unter den Linden, the decorations on which were so thick that inmany cases they screened the buildings from which they hung, wasparticularly happy.  Knots of excited men stood discussing thedefeat of the British Fleet.   Two American friends and I went fromthe street of happy and confident talk into the ZollernhofRestaurant.  With the din of the celebration over the "lifting ofthe blockade" ringing in our ears from the street, we looked on thebill of fare, and there, for the first time, we saw _Boiled Crow_.Through the spring and early summer the people were officiallybuoyed up with the hope that the new harvest would make an end oftheir troubles.  They had many reasons, it is true, to expect animprovement.  The 1915 harvest in Germany had fallen below theaverage.  Therefore, if the 1916 harvest would be better per acre,the additional supplies from the conquered regions of Russia wouldenable Germany to laugh at the efforts of her enemies to starve herout.  Once more, however, official assurances and predictions werewrong, and the economic condition grew worse through every month of1916.CHAPTER XIIIA LAND OF SUBSTITUTESThe only food substitute which meets the casual eye of the visitorto England in war time is margarine for butter.  Germany, on thecontrary, is a land of substitutes.Since the war, food exhibitions in various cities, but moreespecially in Berlin, have had as one of their most prominentfeatures booths where you could sample substitutes for coffee,yeast, eggs, butter, olive oil, and the like.  Undoubtedly many ofthese substitutes are destined to take their place in the futurealongside some of the products for which they are renderingvicarious service.  In fact, in a "Proclamation touching theProtection of Inventions, Designs, and Trade Marks in theExhibition of Substitute-Materials in Berlin-Charlottenburg, 1916,"it is provided that the substitutes to be exhibited shall enjoy theprotection of the Law.  Even before the war, substitutes likeKathreiner's malt coffee were household words, whilst the roastingof acorns for admixture with coffee was not only a usual practiceon the part of some families in the lower middle class, but was sogenerally recognised among the humbler folk that the children ofpoor families were given special printed permissions by the policeto gather acorns for the purpose on the sacred grass of the publicparks.  To deal with meat which in other countries would beregarded as unfit for human consumption there have long beenspecial appliances in regular use in peace time.  The so-called_Freibank_ was a State or municipal butcher's shop attached to theextensive municipal abattoirs in Berlin, Munich, Cologne, andelsewhere.  Here tainted meat, or meat from animals locallyaffected by disease, is specially treated by a steam process andother methods, so as to free it from all danger to health.  Meat sotreated does not, of course, have the nutritive value of ordinaryfresh meat, but the Germans acted on the principle that anythingwas better than nothing.   Such meat was described as _bedingttauglich_ (that is, fit for consumption under reserve).  It wassold before the war at very low rates to the poorer population, whoin times of scarcity came great distances and kept long vigilsoutside the _Freibank_, to be near the head of the queue when thesale began.  Thus we see that many Germans long ago acquired thehabit of standing in line for food, which is such a characteristicof German city life to-day.Horseflesh was consumed before the war in Germany, as in Belgiumand France.  Its sale was carefully controlled by the police, andsevere punishment fell upon anyone who tried to disguise itscharacter.  An ordinary butcher might not sell it at all.  He hadto be specially licensed, and to maintain a special establishmentor a special branch of his business for the purpose.  Thus, whenwider circles of the population were driven to resort tosubstitutes, there was already in existence a State-organisedsystem to control the output.Since the war began, sausage has served as a German stand-by fromthe time that beef and pork became difficult to obtain.  In thelate spring, however, the increased demand for sausage made thatalso more difficult to procure, and we often got a substitute fullof breadcrumbs, which made the food-value of this particular_Wurst_ considerably less than its size would indicate.  It wasfrequently so soft that it was practically impossible to cut, andwe had to spread it on our bread like butter.The substitute of which the world has read the most is war bread.This differs in various localities, but it consists chiefly of amixture of rye and potato with a little wheat flour.  In Hungary,which is a great maize-growing country, maize is substituted forrye.Imitation tea is made of plum and other leaves boiled in real teaand dried.To turn to substitutes other than food, it will be recalled thatGermany very early began to popularise the use of benzol as analternative to petrol for motor engines.  This was a naturaloutgrowth of her marvellously developed coal-tar industry, of whichbenzol is a product.  Prizes for the most effectivebenzol-consuming engine, for benzol carburettors, etc., have beenoffered by various official departments in recent years, and I amtold that during the war ingenious inventions for the moresatisfactory employment of benzol have been adopted.  Owing to theincreased use of potatoes as food, the alcoholic extract from them,always a great German and Austro-Hungarian industry, has had to berestricted.It is an ill wind that blows nobody good, as I learned from theowner of a little general shop in a Brandenburg village.  He toldme that about twenty-five years ago, when kerosene became widelyused in the village for illuminating purposes, he was left with atremendous supply of candles which he could never sell.  The oilfamine has caused the substitution of candle light for lamp lightduring the war, and has enabled him to sell out the whole stock atinflated prices.  All oils are at a premium.  The price ofcastor-oil has risen fivefold in Germany, chiefly owing to the factthat it is being extensively used for aeroplane and otherlubrication purposes.But it is oil from which explosives are derived that chieflyinterests Germany.  Almost any kind of fruit stone containsglycerine.   That is why notices have been put on all trains whichrun through fruit districts, such as Werder, near Berlin, andBaden, advising the people to save their fruit stones and bringthem to special depots for collection.Five pounds of fat treated with caustic soda can be made to yieldone pound of glycerine.  This is one reason, in addition to theBritish blockade, which causes the great fat shortage among thecivil population.Glycerine united with ammonium nitrate is used in the manufactureof explosives.  Deprived of nitrogenous material from SouthAmerica, Germany has greatly developed the process for themanufacture of artificial nitrates.  She spent 25,000,000 poundsafter the outbreak of war to enable her chemists and engineers toturn out a sufficient amount of nitric acid.Toluol, a very important ingredient of explosives, is obtained fromcoal-tar, which Germany is naturally able to manufacture at presentbetter than any other country in the world, since she badpractically a monopoly in coal-tar products before hostilitiescommenced.Evidently, however, substitutes to reinforce goods smuggled throughthe blockade have not sufficed to meet the chemical demands of theGerman Government, for great flaming placards were posted up allover the Empire announcing the commandeering of such commodities assulphur, sulphuric acid, toluol, saltpetre, and the like.Germany long ago claimed to have perfected woodpulp as a substitutefor cotton in propulsive ammunition.  She made this claim veryearly, however, for the purpose of hoodwinking British blockadeadvocates.  Her great need eventually led her to take steps toinduce the United States to insist on the Entente Powers raisingthe blockade on cotton.  She went to great trouble and expense tosend samples by special means to her agents in America.The cotton shortage began to be seriously felt early in 1916 in themanufacturing districts of Saxony, where so many operatives weresuddenly thrown out of work that the Government had to set aside aspecial fund for their temporary relief, until they could betransferred to other war industries.The success which Germany claimed for a cotton-cloth substitute hasbeen greatly exaggerated.  When the Germans realised that GreatBritain really meant business on the question of cotton theycultivated nettle and willow fibre, and made a cloth consisting forthe most part of nettle or willow fibre with a small proportion ofcotton or wool.It was boasted in many quarters that the exclusion of cotton wouldmake but little difference so far as clothing was concerned.  Notonly does the universal introduction of clothing tickets falsifythis boast, but the cloth is found to be a mere makeshift whentested.  Blouses and stockings wear out with discouraging rapiditywhen made of the substitute.My personal investigations still lead me to believe in the motto ofthe Sunny South that: "Cotton is king."Paper, although running short in Germany, is the substitute forcloth in many cases.  Sacking, formerly used for making bags inwhich to ship potatoes and other vegetables, has given way to it.Paper-string is a good substitute widely used, although "no string"was the verbal substitute I often got when buying various articles,and it was necessary for me to hold the paper on to the parcel withmy hands.The craze for substitutes has spread so extensively that there havebeen some unpleasant results both for the purchaser and theproducer, as was the case with several bakers, who were finallydetected and convicted of a liberal use of sawdust in their cakes.Germany has worked especially hard to find a substitute forindiarubber, though with only moderate success.  I know that theKaiser's Government is still sending men into contiguous neutralcountries to buy up every scrap of rubber obtainable.  In no othercommodity has there been more relentless commandeering.  Whenbicycle tyres were commandeered--the authorities deciding thatthree marks was the proper price to pay for a new pair of tyreswhich had cost ten--there was a great deal of complaining.Nevertheless, without an excellent reason, no German could securethe police pass necessary to allow him to ride a bicycle.  Thosewho did obtain permission to ride to and, from their work had toselect the shortest route, and "joy-riding" was forbidden."Substitute rubber" heels for boots could be readily obtained untilthe late summer, but after that only with difficulty.  They werepractically worthless, as I know from personal experience, and wereas hard as leather after one or two days' use.Despite the rubber shortage, the Lower Saxon Rubber Company, ofHildersheim, does a thriving business in raincoats made from rubbersubstitutes.  The factory is running almost full blast, all thework being done by women, and the finished product is a tribute tothe skill of those in charge.It is impossible to buy a real tennis hall in the German Empireto-day.  A most hopeless makeshift ball has been put on the market,but after a few minutes' play it no longer keeps its shape orresiliency.Germany has been very successful in the substitution of a sort ofenamelled-iron for aluminium, brass, and copper.  Some of theRhenish-Westphalian iron industries have made enormous war profits,supplying iron chandeliers, stove doors, pots and pans, and otherarticles formerly made of brass to take the place of thosecommandeered for the purpose of supplying the Army with much-neededmetals.For copper used in electrical and other industries she claims tohave devised substitutes before the war, and her experts now assertthat a two-years' supply of copper and brass has been gathered fromthe kitchens and roofs of Germany.  The copper quest has assumedsuch proportions that the roof of the historic, world-renownedRathaus at Bremen has been stripped.  Nearly half the church bellsof Austria have found their way to the great Skoda Works.Of course Germans never boast of the priceless ornaments they havestolen from Belgium and Northern France.  They joyfully claim thatevery pound of copper made available at home diminishes the amountwhich they must import from abroad, and pay for with theircherished gold.The authorities delight in telling the neutral visitors that theyhave found adequate substitutes for nickel, chromium, and vanadiumfor the hardening of steel.  If that is really so, why does the_Deutschland's_ cargo consist mainly of these three commodities?CHAPTER XIVTHE GAGGING OF LIEBKNECHTAlthough Bismarck gave the Germans a Constitution and a Parliamentafter the Franco-Prussian War as a sop for their sacrifices in thatcampaign, he never intended the Reichstag to be a Parliament in thesense in which the institution is understood in Great Britain.What Bismarck gave the Germans was a debating society and asafety-valve.  They needed a place to air their theories andventilate their grievances.  But the Chancellor of Iron was verycareful, in drawing up the plans for the "debating society," to seethat it conferred little more real power on the nation's"representatives" than is enjoyed by the stump-speakers near MarbleArch in London on Sundays.Many people in England and the United States of America, I find, donot at all understand the meaninglessness of German Parliamentaryproceedings.  When they read about "stormy sittings" of theReichstag and "bitter criticism" of the Chancellor, they judge suchthings as they judge similar events in the House of Commons or theAmerican House of Representatives.  Nothing could be moreinaccurate.  Governments do not fall in Germany in consequence ofadverse Reichstag votes, as they do in England.  They are not thepeopled Governments, but merely the Kaisers creatures.  They riseand fall by his grace alone.Even this state of affairs needs to be qualified and explained tothe citizens of free countries.  The Government is not a Cabinet ora Ministry._The German Government is a one-man affair.  It consists of theImperial Chancellor_.  He, and nobody else, is the "Government,"subject only to the All-Highest will of the Emperor, whose biddingthe Chancellor is required to do.The Chancellor, in the name of the "Government," brings in Bills tobe passed by the Reichstag.  If the Reichstag does not like a Bill,which sometimes happens, it refuses to give it a majority.  But the"Government" does not fall.  It can simply, as it has done onnumerous occasions, dissolve the Reichstag, order a GeneralElection, _and keep on doing so indefinitely_, until it getsexactly the kind of "Parliament" it wants.  Thus, though theReichstag votes on financial matters, it can be made to vote as the"Government" wishes.As I have said, the Reichstag was invented to be, and has alwaysserved the purpose hitherto of, a forum in which discontentedGermany could blow off steam, but achieve little in the way ofremedy or reform.  _But during the war the Reichstag has evenceased to be a place where free speech is tolerated_.  It has beengagged as effectually as the German Press.  I was an eyewitness ofone of the most drastic muzzling episodes which has occurred in theReichstag during the war--or probably in the history of any modernParliament--the suppression of Dr. Karl Liebknecht, member forPotsdam, during the debate on military affairs on January 17, 1916.That event will be of historic importance in establishing howpublic opinion in Germany during the war has been ruthlesslytrampled under foot.The Reichstag has practically nothing to do with the conduct of thewar.Up, practically, to the beginning of 1916 the sporadic SocialDemocratic opposition to the war, mainly by Dr. Liebknecht, wasignored by the Government.  The war-machine was running sosmoothly, and, from the German standpoint, so victoriously, thatthe Government thought it could safely let Liebknecht rant to hisheart's content.Dr. Liebknecht had long been a thorn in the War Party's side.  Heinherited an animosity to Prussian militarism from his late father,Dr. Wilhelm Liebknecht, who with August Bebel founded the modernGerman Social Democratic Party.  Four or five years before the warLiebknecht, a lawyer by profession, campaigned so fiercely againstmilitarism that he was sentenced to eighteen months' fortressimprisonment for "sedition."  He served his sentence, and soonafterwards his political friends nominated him for the Reichstagfor the Royal Division of Potsdam, of all places in the world,knowing that such a candidature would be as ironical a blow ascould be dealt to the war aristocrats.  He was elected by a bigmajority in 1913, the votes of the large working-class populationof the division, including Spandau (the Prussian Woolwich), beingmore than enough to offset the military vote which the Kaiser'shenchmen mobilised against him.  Some time afterwards Liebknechtwas also elected to represent a Berlin Labour constituency in the_Prussian Diet_, the Legislature which deals with the affairs inthe Kingdom of Prussia, as distinct from the Reichstag (the_Imperial Diet_), which concerns itself with Empire matters only.Dr. Liebknecht is forty-four years old.  Of medium build, he wearsa shock of long, curly, upstanding hair, which rather accentuateshis "agitator" type of countenance, and is a skilful and eloquentdebater.  A university graduate and well-read thinker and student,he turned out to be the one consistent Social Democratic politicianin Germany on the question of the war.  When the war began theSocialist Party was effectually and willingly tied to theGovernment's chariot--including, nominally, even Liebknecht.  A fewhours before making his notorious "Necessity-knows-no-law" speechin the Reichstag on August 4, 1914, Bethmann-Hollweg conferred withall the Parliamentary parties, and convinced them (including theSocialists) that Germany had been cruelly dragged into a war ofdefence.  Later in the day, following other party leaders, HerrHaase, spokesman for the Socialists, got up in the House, voiced afew harmless platitudes about Socialist opposition to war onprinciple, and then pledged the party's 111 votes solidly to theWar Credits for which the Government was asking.  When theChancellor afterwards made his celebrated speech it was cheered tothe echo by the entire House, _including the Socialists_.  I do notknow whether Liebknecht was present, though he is almost certain tohave been, but if so he made no note-worthy protest.  Howcompletely the Government befooled the Socialists about the war wasproved a few days later when Dr. Franck, one of the SocialDemocracy's most shining lights and the man who was in line to beBebel's successor, _volunteered_ for military service.  He was oneof the first to fall fighting in September, somewhere in the West.The authorities might have known that Liebknecht was a hard man tokeep quiet if he ever decided to speak out.  Fresh in theGovernment's mind was his bold exposure of the Krupp briberyscandals at the War Office (in 1913) and his disclosures about howthe German munition trust for years systematically stirred up warfever abroad, in order to convince the German people of thenecessity of speeding up their own huge armaments on land and sea.As soon as Liebknecht's Reichstag and Prussian Diet speeches beganto show that he was tired of the muzzle, the Government called himup for military service.  They stuck him into the uniform of an_Armierungssoldat_ (Army Service Corps soldier).  This meant thathis public speeches in connection with the war had to be confinedto the two Parliaments in which he held seats.  Anything of anopposition character which he said or did _outside_ would be"treason" or "sedition."Liebknecht was put to work on A.S.C. jobs behind the frontsalternately in the East and West, I believe, but was given leavesof absence to attend to his Parliamentary duties from time to time.On these occasions he would appear in the Reichstag in the dullfield-grey of an ordinary private--the only member so clad in aHouse of 397 Deputies, among whom are dozens of officers in uniformup to the rank of generals.I was particularly fortunate to be able to secure a card ofadmission to the Strangers' Gallery of the Reichstag on January 17,the day set for discussion of military matters.  I went to my placeearly--a few minutes past the noon hour, as the Reichstag usuallyconvenes at 1 p.m.  The floor was still quite empty, though thegalleries were filled with people anxious, like myself, to see theshow from start to finish.The Reichstag's decorative scheme is panelled oak and gilt-paint.The members' seating space spreads fanlike round the floor, withindividual seats and desks exactly like those used by schoolboys,which is not an inappropriate simile.  On the extreme right are theplaces of the Conservative-Junker--landowners--Party; to their leftsit, in succession, the Roman Catholic Clericals (who occupy theexact centre of the floor and are thus known as the _Zentrum_, orCentre Party).  The "Centre" includes many priests, mostlyRhinelanders and Bavarians.  Then come the National Liberals, theviolently anti-British and anti-American Party, the ProgressivePeople's Party, and the Social Democrats.  The latter are on the"extreme left."  That is why they are often so described in reportsof Reichstag proceedings abroad.  The Socialists comprise 111 outof 397 members of the House, so their segment of the fan is thelargest of all.  Next in size is the Centre Party, with eighty-fiveor ninety seats, the Conservatives, National Liberals, andProgressives accounting for the rest of the floor in more or lessequal proportions.The outstanding aspect of the Reichstag is the tribune forspeakers, which faces the floor and is elevated above it some fiveor six feet.  It is flanked on the right by the Government "table,"consisting of individual seats and desks for Ministers.  In thecentre of the tribune the presiding officer, who is "President,"not Speaker, of the House, sits.  On his left is a row of seats anddesks, like the opposite Government "table," for the members of the_Federal Council_.  The Federal Council, I may remind my readers,consists of the delegates of the various States of Germany.  Theyare not elected by the people, but are appointed by the rulers ofthe several States.  They constitute practically an Imperial UpperChamber, and are the real legislative body of the Empire.  Billsrequire the Federal Council's approval before submission to theReichstag.On so-called "big days" in the Reichstag a host of small fry fromthe Departments collects behind the Government and this dominentFederal Council.  The Chancellor, whose place is at the corner ofthe Government "table" nearest the President, is always shepherdedby his political aide-de-camp, Dr. Wahnschaffe.  There is always agroup of uniformed Army and Navy officers on the tribune, too, andto-day, of course, as the Army discussions were on the agenda,there was an unusually brave array of gold braid and brass buttons.Herr von Oldenburg, a prominent Junker M.P., once said if he werethe Kaiser he would send a Prussian lieutenant and ten men to closeup the Reichstag.Liebknecht arrived early, a slight and unimpressive figure insomewhat worn field-grey, the German khaki.  The "debate" havingbegun, I noticed how he listened eagerly to every word spoken,jotting down notes incessantly for the evident purpose of replyingto the grandiloquent utterances about our "glorious army of_Kultur_-bearers" which were falling from the lips of "patriotic"party orators.  Liebknecht had earned the displeasure of the Housea few days before by asking some embarrassing questions aboutTurkish massacres in Armenia.  He was jeered and laughed athilariously; when he went on to say that a "Black Chamber" wasspying on his every movement, shadowing other members of theReichstag, even eavesdropping on their telephone conversations andopening their private correspondence.While a Socialist comrade, Herr Davidssohn, was speaking from thedesk in the centre of the tribune, at which all members must standwhen addressing the House, I now saw Liebknecht walking up theaisle leading from the Socialist seats to the President's chair asunobtrusively as possible.  He was walking furtively and he cut thefigure of a hunted animal which is conscious that it is surroundedby other animals anxious to pounce upon it and devour it if itdares to show itself in the open.Liebknecht has now reached the President's side.  The President, along-whiskered septuagenarian, is popularly known as "Papa" Kaempf.I see Liebknecht whispering quietly in Kaempf's ear.  He is askingfor permission to speak, probably as soon as comrade Davidssohn hasfinished making his innocuous suggestions of minor reforms torelieve discomforts in the trenches.  Kaempf is shaking his headnegatively.  As the official executor of the House's wishes, theold man understands perfectly well that Liebknecht must under nocircumstances have a hearing.  Davidssohn has now stopped talking.Liebknecht has meantime reached the bottom step of the stairway offive or six steps leading from the tribune to the level of thefloor.  He can be plainly seen from all sections of the House.  Ihear him start to say that he has a double right to be heard on theArmy Bill, not only as a member of the House, but as a soldier.  Hegets no further.  The Chamber is already filled with shouts andjeers.  "_Maul halten_!" (shut your mouth!) bursts from a dozenplaces in the Conservative and rational Liberal and Centre benches."'_Raus mit ihm!" (throw him out!) is another angry taunt which Ican distinguish in the bedlam.  Liebknecht has been howled downmany times before under similar circumstances.  He is not terrifiedto-day, though his face is pale with excitement and anger.  Hestands his ground.  His right arm is extended, a finger levelledaccusingly at the Right and Centre from which imprecations,unceasingly, are being snarled at him.  But he cannot make himselfheard amid the uproar.A Socialist colleague intervenes, Ledebour, a thin, grey-haired,actor-like person, of ascetic mien and resonant voice.  "Checkingfree speech is an evil custom of this House," declares Ledebour."Papa" Kaempf clangs his big hand-bell.  He rules out "suchimproper expressions as 'evil custom' in this high House." Ledebouris the Reichstag's master of repartee.  He rejoinssmilingly:--"Very well, not an 'evil custom,' but not altogether apleasant custom."  Now the House is howling Ledebour down.  He,too, has weathered such storms before.  He waits, impassive andundismayed, for a lull in the cyclone.  It comes.  "Wait, wait!" hethunders.  "My friend Liebknecht and I, and others like us, have agreat following.  You grievously underestimate that following.Some day you will realise that.  Wait----"  Ledebour, likeLiebknecht, can no longer proceed.  The House is now boiling, anindistinguishable and most undignified pandemonium.  I can detectthat there is considerable ironical laughter mixed with itsindignation.   Members are not taking Ledebour's threat seriously.Liebknecht has temporarily returned to his seat under cover of thetornado provoked by Ledebour's intervention, but now I see himstealthily crawling, dodging, almost panther-like, back to thesteps of the tribune.  He is bent upon renewing the attempt toraise his voice above the hostile din.  The sight of him unchainsthe House's fury afresh.  The racket is increased by the madding-donging of "Papa" Kaempf, trying hopelessly to restore asemblance of quiet.  It is useless.  The House will not subsideuntil Liebknecht is driven from the speakers' tribune.  He is notto have even the chance of the lull which enabled Ledebour to say apertinent thing or two.  A score of embittered deputies advancetoward the tribune, red-faced and gesticulating in the German waywhen excitement is the dominant passion.  Their fists are clenched.I say to myself that Liebknecht will this time be beaten down, ifhe is not content to be shouted down.  He makes an unforgettablefigure, alone there, assailed, barked and snarled at from everyside, a private in the German Army bidding defiance to a hundredmen, also in uniform, but superior officers.  Mere _Kanonenfutter_(cannon fodder) defying the majestic authority of its helmeted andepauletted overlords!  An unprecedented episode, as well as anunforgettable one. . .Liebknecht insists upon tempting fate once more.  He is going totry to outshout the crazy chorus howling at him.  He succeeds, butonly for an instant and to the extent of one biting phrase:--"Suchtreatment," I can hear him shrieking, "is _unverschaemt_(shameless) and _unerhoert_ (unheard of)!  It could take place inno other legislative body in the world!"With that the one German Social Democrat of conviction, courage,and consistency retires, baffled and discomfited.  Potsdam'srepresentative in the Reichstag is at last effectually muzzled, butin the muzzling I have seen the German Government at work on a taskalmost as prodigious as the one it now faces on the Somme--the taskof keeping the German people deaf, dumb, and blind.Of what has meantime happened to Liebknecht the main facts areknown.  He was arrested on May 1 for alleged "incitement to publicdisorder during a state of war," tried, convicted, and sentenced topenal servitude.  A couple of months previously (on March 13) hehad delivered another bitter attack on the War Government in thePrussian Diet.  He accused the German educational authorities ofsystematically teaching hate to school children and of distortingeven contemporary history so as to poison their minds to theglorification of Prussian militarism.  He said it was not thebusiness of the schools to turn children into machines for theMoloch of militarism."_Let us teach history correctly_," declared Liebknecht, "_and tellthe children that the crime of Sarajevo was looked upon by widecircles in Austria-Hungary and Germany as a gift from Heaven.  Letus. . . ._"He got no farther, for the cyclone broke.  He had dared to do whatno other man in Germany had done.  He had publicly accused hisGovernment of making the war.  From that moment his doom wascertain.This narrative should be instructive to those Britishers andAmericans who think it possible that German Socialists may one dayhave the power to end the war.  There are two effective replies tothis curious Anglo-Saxon misunderstanding of Germany.  The first isthat Liebknecht had not, and has not, the support of his own party;the second, that were that party twice as numerous as it is itsvotes would be worthless in view of the power wielded by theKaiser's representative, von Bethmann-Hollweg, backed up by theFederal Council.It is difficult to drive this fact into the heads of British andAmerican people, who are both prone to judge German institutions bytheir own.For, remember always that behind the dominant Imperial Chancellor,von Bethmann-Hollweg, stands the All-Highest War Lord, and behindhim, what is still, if damaged, the mightiest military machine inthe world--the German Army.  Opposed to that there is at present aslowly increasing Socialist vote--the two have grown to abouttwenty.CHAPTER XVPREVENTIVE ARRESTIn the beginning of the war, when all seemed to be going well,there was no disunity in Germany.  When Germany was winning victoryafter victory, practically no censorship was needed in thenewspapers; the police were tolerant; every German smiled uponevery other German; soldiers went forth singing and their trainswere gaily decorated with oak leaves; social democracy praisedmilitarism.All that has changed and the hosts who went singing on their way inthe belief that they would be home in six weeks, have left behindhomes many of them bereaved by the immense casualties, and most ofthem suffering from the increased food shortage.Class feeling soon increased.  The poor began to call the richagrarians "usurers."  The Government forbade socialistic paperssuch as the _Vorwaerts_ to use the word "usurer" any more, becauseit was applied to the powerful junkers.  Such papers as the_Tagliche Rundschau_ and the _Tageszeitung_ could continue to useit, however, for they applied it to the small shopkeeper whoexceeded the maximum price by a fraction of a penny.As the rigour of the blockade increased, the discontent of thesmall minority who were beginning to hate their own Governmentalmost as much as, and in many cases more, than they hated enemiesof Germany, assumed more threatening forms than mere discussion.Their disillusionment regarding Germany's invincibility openedtheir eyes to faults at home.  Some of the extreme Social Democratswere secretly spreading the treasonable doctrine that the GermanGovernment was not entirely blameless in the causes of the war.  Ithas been my custom to converse with all classes of society, and Iwas amazed at the increasing number of disgruntled citizens.But the German Government is still determined to have unity.  Theyhad enlisted the services of editors, reporters, professors,parsons and cinema operators to create it; they are now giving thepolice an increasingly important role to maintain it.As the German Parliament in no way resembles the BritishParliament, so do the German, police in no way resemble the Britishpolice.  The German police, mounted or unmounted, are armed with arevolver, a sword, and not infrequently provided with amachine-gun.  They have powers of search and arrest withoutwarrant.  They are allowed at their discretion to strike orotherwise maltreat not only civilians, but soldiers.  Always armedwith extraordinary power, their position during the past few monthshas risen to such an extent that the words used in the Reichstag,"The Reign of Terror," are not an exaggeration.Aided and even abetted by a myriad of spies and_agents-provocateurs_, they have placed under what is known as"preventive arrest" throughout the German Empire and Austria sogreat a number of civilians that the German prisons, as has beenadmitted, are filled to repletion.With the Reichstag shut up, and the hold on the newspaperstightening,-what opportunity remains by which independent thoughtcan be disseminated?In Poland meetings to consider what they call "Church affairs," butwhich were really revolutionary gatherings, afforded opportunityfor discussion.  These have been ruled out of order.The lectures taking place in their thousands all over Germany mightafford a chance of expression of opinion, but the professors, likethe pastors, are, as I have said, so absolutely dependent upon theGovernment for their position and promotion, that I have only heardof one of them who had the temerity to make any speech other thanthose of the "God-punish-England" and "We-must-hold-out" type.  Hisresignation from the University of Munich was immediately demanded,and any number of sycophants were ready to take his place.Clubs are illegal in Germany, and the humblest working-men's_cafes_ are attended by spies.  In my researches in the BerlinEast-end I often visited these places and shared my adulteratedbeer and war bread with the working folk--all of them over or undermilitary age.One evening a shabby old man said rather more loudly than wasnecessary to a number of those round him:--"I am tired of readingin the newspapers how nice the war is.  Even the _Vorwaerts_ (thena Socialist paper) lies to us.  I am tired of walking home nightafter night and finding restaurants turned into hospitals for thewounded."He was referring in particular to the great _Schultheiss_working-men's restaurants in Hasenheide.  His remarks were receivedwith obvious sympathy.A couple of nights later I went into this same place and took myseat, but it was obvious that my visit was unwelcome.  I was lookedat suspiciously.  I did not think very much of the incident, butten days later in passing I called again, when a lusty young fellowof eighteen, to whom I had spoken on my first visit, came forwardand said to me, almost threateningly, "You are a stranger here.May I ask what you are doing?"I said: "I am an American newspaper correspondent, and am trying tofind out what I can about the ways of German working folk."He could tell by my accent that I was a foreigner, and said: "Wethought that you had told the Government about that little freespeaking we had here a few days ago.  You know that the little oldman who was complaining about the restaurants being turned intohospitals has been arrested?"This form of arrest, by which hundreds of people are mysteriouslydisappearing, is one of the burning grievances of Germany to-day.In its application it resembles what we used to read about Russianpolice.  It has created a condition beneath the surface in Germanyresembling the terrorism of the French Revolution.  In the absenceof a Habeas Corpus Act, the victim lies in gaol indefinitely, whilethe police are, nominally, collecting the evidence against him.One cannot move about very long without coming across instances ofthis growing form of tyranny, but I will merely give one other.A German family, resident in Sweden, were in correspondence with awoman resident in Prussia.  In one of her letters she incautiouslyremarked, "What a pity that the two Emperors cannot be taught whatwar really means to the German peoples."  She had lost two sons,and her expression of bitterness was just a feminine outburst,which in any other country, would have been passed by.  She wasplaced under preventive arrest and is still in gaol.The police are armed with the censorship of the internal postalcorrespondence, telegrams and telephones.  One of the complaints ofthe Social Democrat members of the Reichstag is that every movementis spied upon, and their communications tampered with by what theycall the "Black Chamber."There is no reason to suppose that the debates in the closingsession of the Reichstag in 1916 on police tyranny, the Presscensorship, the suppression of public opinion, will lead to anyresult other than the familiar expressions of mildindignation--such as that which came from the National Liberal andPan-German leader, Dr. Paasche--and perhaps a little innocentlegislation.  But the reports of the detailed charges against theGovernment constitute, even as passed by the German censorship forpublication, a remarkable revelation.  It should be remembered inreading the following quotations that the whole subject has beendiscussed in the secrecy of the Reichstag Committee, and that whatis now disclosed is in the main only what the Government has beenunable to hush up or hide.In his famous speech on "preventive arrest" the Social DemocraticDeputy, Herr Dittmann said:--"Last May I remarked that the system of preventive arrest wasproducing a real reign of terror, and since then things have gotsteadily worse.  The law as it was before 1848 and the SocialistLaw, of scandalous memory, are celebrating their resurrection.  Thesystem of denunciation and of _agents-provocateurs_ is in fullbloom, and it is all being done under the mask of patriotism andthe saving of the country.  Anybody who for personal or otherreasons is regarded by the professional _agents-provocateurs_ asunsatisfactory or inconvenient is put under suspicion of espionage,or treason, or other crime.  And such vague denunciations are thensufficient to deprive the victim of his freedom, without anypossibility of defence being given him.  In many cases such arresthas been maintained by the year without any lawful foundation forit.  Treachery and low cunning are now enjoying real orgies.  Acriminal is duly convicted and knows his fate.  The man underpreventive arrest is overburdened by the uncertainty of despair,and is simply buried alive.  The members of the Government do notseem to have a spark of understanding for this situation, themental and material effects of which are equally terrible."Dr. Helfferich said in the Budget Committee in the case of Dr.Franz Mehring that it is better that he should be under detentionthan that he should be at large and do something for which he wouldhave to be punished.  According to this reasoning the best thingwould be to lock up everybody and keep them from breaking the law.The ideal of Dr. Helfferich seems to be the German National Prisonof which Heine spoke.  The case of Mehring is classical proof ofthe fact that we are no longer far removed from the Helfferichideal."Herr Dittmann went on to say that Herr Mehring's only offence wasthat in a letter seized by the police he wrote to a Reichstagdeputy named Herzfeld in favour of a peace demonstration in Berlin,and offered to write a fly-sheet inviting attendance at such ameeting.  Mehring, who is over 70 years of age, was then locked up.Herr Dittmann continued:--"How much longer will it be before even thoughts become criminal inGermany?  Mehring is one of the most brilliant historians andwriters, and one of the first representatives of Germanintellectual life--known as such far beyond the German frontiers.When it is now known abroad that such a man has been put under asort of preventive arrest merely in order to cut him off from thepublic for political reasons, one really cannot be astonished atthe low reputation enjoyed by the German Government both at homeand abroad.  How evil must be the state of a Government which hasto lock up the first minds of the country in order to choke theiropposition!"Herr Dittmann's second case was that of Frau Rosa Luxemburg.  Hesaid that she was put under arrest many months ago, without anycharge being made against her, and merely out of fear of herintellectual influence upon the working classes.  All the Socialistwomen of Germany were deeply indignant, and he invited theGovernment to consider that such things must make it the positiveduty of Socialists in France, England, Italy and Russia "to fightagainst a Government which imprisons without any reason thebest-known champions of the International proletariat."  Thetreatment of both Mehring and Frau Luxemburg had been terrible.The former, old and ill, had had the greatest difficulty in gettingadmission to a prison infirmary.  Frau Luxemburg a month ago wastaken from her prison bed in the middle of the night, removed tothe police headquarters, and put in a cell which was reserved forprostitutes.  She had not been allowed a doctor, and had been givenfood which she could not eat.  Just before the Reichstag debate shehad been, taken away from Berlin to Wronke, in the Province ofPosen.Herr Dittmann then gave a terrible account, some of it unfit forreproduction, of the treatment in prison of two girls of eighteenwhose offence was that on June 27th they had distributedinvitations to working women to attend a meeting of protest againstthe procedure in the case of Herr Liebknecht.  He observed thatthey owed it entirely to themselves and to their training if theyhad not been ruined physically and morally in their "royal Prussianprison."  When they were at last released they were informed thatthey would be imprisoned for the rest of the war if they attendedany public meeting.  Herr Dittmann proceeded:--"Here we have police brutality in all its purity.  This is how aworking-class child who is trying to make her way up to knowledgeand _Kultur_ is treated in the country of the promised 'neworientation,' in which (according to the Imperial Chancellor) 'theroad is to be opened for all who are efficient.'  These are themethods by which the spirit of independence is systematically to bebilled.  That is the reason for the arrests of members of theSocialist party who stand on the side of determined opposition.You imagine that by isolating the leading elements of theopposition you can crush the head of the snake."Herr Dittmann's next case was that of Dr. Meyer, one of the editorsof _Vorwaerts_, who was arrested many months ago.  He is sufferingfrom tuberculosis, but is not allowed to go to a sanatorium.Another Socialist journalist named Regge, father of six children,has been under arrest since August, his only offence being that hehas agitated against the militarist majority.  Herr Dittmann thendealt at length with the Socialist journalist named Kluhs, who hasbeen in prison for eight months, also for his activity on behalf ofthe Socialist minority against the majority, and was prevented fromcommunicating with his dying wife or attending her funeral,Herr Dittmann gave the details of three cases at Dusseldorf and oneat Brunswick, and then explained how the military authorities inmany parts of Germany are deliberately offering Socialists thechoice between silence and military service.  A well-known tradeunion official at Elberfeld, named Sauerbrey, who had been declaredtotally unfit for military service because he had lost severalfingers on his left hand, was arrested and charged with treason.He was acquitted, but instead of obtaining his freedom he wasimmediately called up and is now in training for the front.  HerrDittmann said that this case had caused intense bitterness, andadded:--"The Military Command at Munster is surprised that the feeling inthe whole Wupper Valley is becoming more and more discontented, andthe military are now hatching new measures of violence in order tobe able to master this discontent.  One would think that suchthings came from the madhouse.  In reality they representconditions under martial law, and this case is only one of verymany."Herr Dittmann gave several instances of men declared unfit forservice who had been called up for political reasons, and he endedhis speech as follows:--"In regard to all this persecution of peaceful citizens there is aregular apparatus of _agents-provocateurs_, provided by officialsof all kinds, and the apparatus is growing every day.  If thesepersecutions were stopped a great number of these agents andofficials could be released for military service.  In most casesthey are mere shirkers, and that is why they cling to their postsand _seek every day to prove themselves indispensable bydiscovering all sorts of crimes_.  Because they do not want to goto the trenches other people must go to prison.  Put an end to thestate of martial law, and help us to root up a state of thingswhich disgraces the German name."The Alsatian deputy, Herr Haus, said that Alsace-Lorraine issuffering more than any other part of the country, and that morethan 1,000 persons have been arrested without any charge beingbrought against them.  Herr Seyda, for the Poles, said that thePolish population of Germany suffers especially from the system ofpreventive arrest.In his contemptuous reply, which, showed that the Government wasconfident that it had nothing to fear from the majority in theReichstag, Herr Helfferich said:--"The institution of the dictator comes from ancient Rome, from theclassical Republic of antiquity.  (Laughter.)  When the State wasfighting for its existence it was found necessary to place supremepower in the hands of a single man, and to give this Roman dictatorauthority which was much greater than the authority belonging topreventive arrest and martial law.  The whole development proceedsby way of compromise between the needs of the State and the needsof protection for the individual.  The results vary according tothe particular level of civilisation reached by the particularState.  (Socialist cries of 'Very true.')  We are not at the lowestlevel.  When one considers the state of things in Germany in peacetime we can be proud.  (Socialist interruptions.)  I am proud ofGermany.  I think that our constitutional system before theoutbreak of war and our level of _Kultur_ were such as every Germancould be proud of.  ('No, no.')  I hope that we shall soon be ableto revert to those conditions."Herr Helfferich went on to argue that repression in Germany isreally much milder than in France, England, or Italy; and for thedebate on the censorship, which followed the debate on preventivearrest, he came armed with an account of the Defence of the RealmActs.  When he enlarged upon the powers of the British Governmenthe was interrupted by cries of "It is a question not of theory butof practice," and the Socialist leader Herr Stadthagen made ascathing reply.  He said:--"Even if everything in England is as Herr Helfferich described it,the state of things is much better there than in Germany.  HerrHelfferich stated the cases in which arrest and search of dwellingsmay take place, but those are cases in which similar action can betaken in Germany in time of peace under the ordinary criminal law.The Englishman has quite other rights.  He has the right to hispersonality, and, above all, the officials in England, unlikeGermany, are personally responsible.  When we make a law, that lawis repealed by the Administration.  That is the whole point, butHerr Helfferich does not see it, and he does not see that we livein a Police State and under a police system.  Did it ever occur toanybody in England to dispute the right of immunity of members ofparliament?  Did it ever occur to anybody in England to go tomembers of the Opposition in Parliament and demand that they shouldresign their seats on pain of arrest?  Or has anybody in Englandbeen threatened with arrest if he does not withdraw a declarationagainst the committee of his party?  Two newspapers have beensuppressed in England because they opposed munitions work.  Iregret this check upon free criticism in England, but what wouldhave happened in Germany?  In Germany there would undoubtedly havebeen a prosecution for high treason.  In England, moreover, thenewspapers are allowed to reappear, and that without giving anyguarantees.  In Germany we are required to give guarantees that thepapers shall be conducted by a person approved of by the politicalpolice.  Herr Helfferich employs inappropriate comparisons.  I willgive him one which applies.  The political police in Germany isprecisely what the State Inquisition was in Venice."An interesting point in the censorship debate was the disclosure ofthe fact that the local censors do what they please.  Herr Seydaprotested against the peculiar persecution of the Poles.  Heremarked that at Gnesen no Polish paper has been allowed to appearfor the past two years.But as significant as anything was Herr Stadthagen's account of therecruiting for the political police.  He said that the policefreely offer both money and exemption from military service to boyswho are about to become liable for service.  He gave a typical caseof a boy of seventeen.  The police called at his home and inquiredwhether he belonged to any Socialist organisation and whether hehad been medically examined for the Army.  A police official thenwaylaid the boy as he was leaving work and promised him that, if hewould give information of what went on in his Socialistassociation, he could earn from 4 pounds to 4 pounds 10 shillings amonth and be exempt from military service.There is a peculiar connection between censorship and police.  Theevil effect of the censorship of their own Press by the GermanGovernment is to hypnotise the thousands of Government bureaucratsinto the belief that that which they read in their own controlledPress is true.No people are more ready to believe what they want to believe thanthe governing class in Germany.  They wanted to believe that GreatBritain would not come into the war.  They had got into theirheads, too, that Japan was going to be an ally of theirs.  Theywrote themselves into the belief that France was defeated and wouldcollapse.Regarding the Press, as they do, as all-important, they picked fromthe British Press any articles or fragments of articles suitablefor their purpose and quoted them.  They are adepts in the art ofdissecting a paragraph so that the sense is quite contrary to thatmeant by the writer.But the German Government goes further than that.  It is quitecontent to quote to-day expressions of Greek opinion from Athensorgans well known to be subsidised by Germany.  Certain bribedpapers in Zurich and Stockholm, and one notorious American paper,are used for this process of self-hypnotism.  The object istwo-fold.  First, to influence public opinion in the foreigncountry, and, secondly, by requoting the opinion, to influencetheir own people into believing that this is the opinion held inthe country from which it emanates.  Thus, when I told Germans thatlarge numbers of the Dutch people are pro-Ally, they point to anextract from an article in _De Toekomst_ and controvert me.These methods go to strengthen the hands of the police when theydeclare that in acting severely they are only acting againstanarchistic opinions likely to create the impression abroad thatthere is disunity within the Empire.Never, so far as I can gather, in the world's history was there socomplete a machine for the suppression of individual opinion as theGerman police.The anti-war demonstrations in Germany range all the way from thesmashing of a few food-shop windows to the complete preparationsfor a serious crippling of the armies in the field by a generalmunition strike.Half-way between were the so-called "Liebknecht riots" in Berlin.The notices summoning these semi-revolutionary meetings werewhispered through factories, and from mouth to mouth by womenstanding in the food lines waiting for their potatoes, morningbread, meat, sugar, cheese, and other supplies.  Liebknecht wasbrought to secret trial on June 27th, on the evening of whichdemonstrations took place throughout the city.  I was present atthe one near the Rathaus, which was dispersed towards midnight whenthe police actually drew their revolvers and charged the crowd.The following evening I was at an early hour in the PotsdamerPlatz, where a great demonstration was to take place.  It was thesecond anniversary of the murder at Sarajevo.  The city was clearlyrestless, agitated; people were on the watch for something tohappen.  The Potsdamer Platz is the centre through which the greatarteries of traffic flow westward after the work of the day isdone.  The people who stream through it do not belong to the poorerclasses, for these live in the east and the north.  But on thismild June evening there was a noticeably large number of workingmen in the streets leading into the Platz.  I was standing near agroup of these when the evening editions appeared with the newsthat Liebknecht had been sentenced.  A low murmur among theworkmen, mutterings of suppressed rage when they realised thesignificance of the short trial of two days, and a determinedmovement toward the place of demonstration.I hurried to the Potsdamer Platz.  The number of police stationedin the streets leading into it increased.  The Platz itself wasblue with them, for they stood together in groups of six, ten andtwelve.  I went along the Budapester Strasse to the BrandenburgerTor, through which workmen from Moabit had streamed at noondeclaring that they would strike.  They had been charged by themounted police, who drove them back across the Spree.  There was ablue patrol along the Unter den Linden now.  A whole army corps ofpolice were on the alert in the German capital.I returned to the Potsdamer Platz.  It was thick with peoplenow--curious onlookers.  There were crowds of workmen in theadjacent streets, but they were not allowed to approach too near.Again and again they tried, but, unarmed, they were powerless whenthe horses were driven into them, I saw a few of the most obstinatestruck with the flat of sabres, and on others were rained blowsfrom the police on foot.  Nobody hit Back, or even defended himself.There was practically no violence such as one expects from a mob.It was something else which impressed me.  It impressed mypolice-lieutenant friend, also.  That was the dangerous ugliness inthe workmen.  Hate was written in their faces, and the low growl inthe crowd told all too plainly the growing feeling against the war.The Government realised this.  They had already seen that the unitythey had so artificially created could only be held by force.  Theyhad used force in the muzzling of Liebknecht, and quietly they wereemploying a most potent force every day, the force of preventivearrest.In July there was agitation for the great munition strike which wasto have taken place on the day of the second anniversary of thewar.  The dimensions of the proposed rising were effectuallyconcealed by the censorship.  The ugly feeling in the PotsdamerPlatz had taught the Government a lesson.No detail was neglected in the preparations against the strike.There was a significant movement of machine-guns to all points ofdanger, such as the Moabit district of Berlin, and Spandau,together with countless warnings against so-called "anarchists."Any workman who showed the slightest tendency to be a leader in afactory group was taken away.  The expressions of intention not towork the first four days of August became so strong that the Pressissued a warning that any man refusing to work would be put into auniform, and he would receive not eight or more marks a day as inmunition work, but three marks in ten days.  Even the Kaisersupplemented his regular anniversary manifestoes to the armedforces of the Empire and the civilian population with a specialappeal to the workmen.I was up and ready at an early hour on the morning of August 1st.Again the city was blue with police.  But this time they werereinforced.   As I walked through streets lined with soldiers inthe workingmen's quarters, I realised the futility of any furtheranti-war demonstrations in the Fatherland.I stood in the immense square before the Royal Palace, andreflected that two years ago it was packed with a crowd wild withjoy at the opportunity of going to war.  There was unity.  I stoodon the very spot where the old man was jeered because he had said,"War is a serious business, young fellow."On August 1st, 1916, there were more police in the square thancivilians.  On Unter den Linden paced the blue patrol.  There wasstill unity in Germany, but a unity maintained by revolver, swordand machine-gun.CHAPTER XVIPOLICE RULE IN BOHEMIAIn his speech to the Senate President Wilson, said: "No peace canlast, or ought to last, which does not recognise and accept theprinciple that Governments derive all their just powers from theconsent at the governed. . . .  No nation should seek to extend itspolity over any other nation or people, but every people should beleft free to determine its own policy, its own way of development,unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the greatand powerful."The realisation of these admirable sentiments presents infiniteproblems in various sections of Europe, but nowhere, perhaps, morethan in Austria-Hungary.  In his heterogeneous collection ofpeoples, the old Emperor had to make a choice between two coursesin order to hold his thirteen distinct races together in oneEmpire.  He could have tried to make them politically contentedthrough freedom to manage their own affairs while owing allegianceto the Empire as a whole, or he could suppress the individualpeople to such an extent that he would have unity by force.He chose the second course.  With the Germans dominant in Austriaand the Magyars in Hungary, other nations have been scientificallysubjugated.  As in the case of the procedure of "Preventive Arrest"in Germany, the authorities seek to work smoothly and silently,with the result that only an occasional echo reaches the outsideworld.The description of the relations of the various peoples and the"Unity-Machine" employed would fill a large book.  Control ofpublic opinion has been the first action of the rulers of the DualMonarchy.  In peace time, not only were the suppressed nations,such as the Czechs, Slovaks, Rumanians, Luthenians, Poles,Slovenes, Italians, but all the citizens of Austria-Hungary, deniedthe right of free speech and freedom of the Press.  Some of theregulations by which the Government held absolute sway over itssubjects are:(1) No newspaper or other printing business could be establisheduntil a heavy deposit was made with the police for the payment offines, such fines to be arbitrarily imposed by the police--in whomis vested extraordinary power--when anything political was writtenwhich did not please them.  They are difficult to please, I may add.(2) A complete copy of each edition must be sent to the policebefore it was put on sale.  "Good" editors whose inspiration was ofa nature to enable them to interpret the wishes of the Government,sometimes received a dispensation from this formality.(3) No club might hold a private meeting.  A representative of thepolice must be present.  This rule was often extended even tofriendly gatherings in private homes in such places as Bohemia.(4) No political meeting might be held without a permit, and arepresentative of the police must be present.  Often he sat on theplatform.  It is amusing for the visitor from a free country toattend a political meeting where the chairman, speaker andpoliceman file up on the stage to occupy the three chairs reservedfor them.  The policeman may be heard by those in the front rowscontinually cautioning the speaker.  If he thinks the speaker istalking too freely he either intervenes through the chairman andasks him to be moderate or dismisses the meeting.These regulations, I again remind the reader, were in force inpeace time.  It is easy to see how an extension of them effectuallychecks attempts of the Czechs (Bohemians) and other peoples tolegislate themselves into a little freedom.When I came to England early in the war from Austria-Hungary andGermany I heard many expressions of hope that the discontentedraces in the Empire of Francis Joseph would rebel, and laterexpressions of surprise that they did not.  Englishmen held theopinion that such races would be decidedly averse from fighting forthe Hapsburgs.  The opinion was correct, and nobody knew thisbetter than the Hapsburgs themselves.Like the German Government in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, theAustrian Government has endeavoured to mislead public opinion inforeign countries as to the state of mind of the Czechs by falseinformation and to conceal the true military and politicalsituation from the population at home.  Austria's first problem atthe outbreak of war--a problem which has been worked out to thelast detail--was rapidly to move the soldiers of the subjugatedraces from their native lands.  Since the Bosnians, for example,are of the Serbian race, they were mobilised secretly in the middleof July and sent out of Bosnia.  I saw 30,000 moved through Triesteseveral days before war was declared on Serbia.  A Germanacquaintance, with great shipping interests, enthusiasticallyindiscreet at sight of them, exclaimed to the little group of whichI was one: "A wonderful system--a wonderful system!  The Bosnianscould not be trusted to fight the Serbs.  But we Germans can usethem if they prove troublesome to Austria," he continued excitedly."We can send them against the French.  We will tell them that ifthey do not shoot the French, we will shoot _them_."  I thoughtthis a rather curious conversation for July 25th, 1914.Less than fortnight later I saw two Bohemian regiments arrive atPrasso, Transylvania, the province farthest removed from theirhomes, to be garrisoned in a region, the population of which isRumanian, Hungarian and Saxon.  I was told later that the Rumanianswho had left the garrisons at Prasso had gone to Bohemia.  As Iobserved these initial steps in the great smooth-runningAustro-Hungarian military machine, I was impressed with theimpossibility of revolution.  With the soldier elementscientifically broken up and scattered all over the country, whocould revolt--the women and children?The Slav soldiers of Austria-Hungary desert to Russia at everyopportunity.  The fact that she now has upwards of 1,200,000Austro-Hungarian prisoners is sufficient refutation of thesugar-coated propaganda describing how all the peoples who make upAustria-Hungary rushed loyally and enthusiastically to arms to thedefence of their Emperor and common country.  This is perfectlytrue of the politically dominant races, the Germans and theMagyars, but the "enthusiasm" I witnessed among the subjugatedraces consisted chiefly of sad-faced soldiers and weeping women.The Bohemians have given most trouble.  One German officer who wassent to Austria to help bolster up her army told me that he didn'tworry over the desertion of Bohemians singly and in small groups.He expected that.  But he did take serious exception to theincreasingly popular custom of whole battalions with their officersand equipment passing over to the Russian lines intact.The story of the Bohemian regiment trapped in the Army of Leopoldof Bavaria is generally known in Austria.  When the staff learnedthat this regiment planned to cross to the Russians on a certainnight, three Bavarian regiments, well equipped with machine-guns,were set to trap it.  Contrary to usual procedure, the Bohemianswere induced by the men impersonating the Russians to lay downtheir arms as an evidence of good faith before crossing.  The wholeregiment was then rounded up and marched to the rear, where apublic example was made of it.  The officers were shot.  Then everytenth man was shot.  The Government, in order to circumvent anyunfavourable impression which this act might make in Bohemia,caused to be read each day for three days in the schools a decreeof the Emperor, condemning the treachery of this regiment, thenumber of which was ordered for ever to be struck from the militaryrolls of the Empire.During the terrific fighting at Baranowitchi in the great Russianoffensive last summer, at a time when the Russians repeatedly butunsuccessfully stormed that important railway junction, somePrussian units found their right flank unsupported one morning atdawn, because two Bohemian battalions had changed flags during thenight.  The next Russian attack caused the Prussians to lose 48 percent. of their men.This was the final straw for the Staff of Leopold's Army.  An Orderwas issued explaining to the troops that henceforth no more Czechswould have the honour of doing first line duty, since their couragewas not of as high a degree as that of the others.  I found thatthe Prussians, despite their depleted state, actually believed thisexplanation, which filled them with pride in themselves andcontempt for the Czechs.But the German officers in charge of reorganising theAustro-Hungarian Army were not content to let Bohemians performsafe duties in the rear.  Consequently, they diluted them until noregiment contained more than 20 per cent.The authorities have been no less thorough with the civilianpopulation.  From the day of mobilisation all political life wassuspended.  The three parties of the Opposition, the Radicals, theNational-Socialists, and the Progressives, were annihilated andtheir newspapers suppressed.   Their leaders, such men as Kramarzh,Rasin, Klofatch, Scheiner, Mazaryk, Durich, the men who served asguides to the nation, were imprisoned or exiled.  This is surely aviolation of the principle that Governments derive their justpowers from the consent of the governed, for all these men were thetrue representatives of the people.  The fact that the Governmentwas obliged to get rid of the leaders of the nation shows what thereal situation in Bohemia is.The Czech deputies who were considered dangerous, numbering forty,were mobilised.  They were not all sent to the front; some wereallowed temporary exemption; but the Government gave them tounderstand that the slightest act of hostility towards the Monarchyon their part would result in their being called up immediately andsent to the front.The fetters of the Press were drawn more tightly.  Even the Germanpapers were not allowed into Bohemia.  For some months, two orthree enterprising editors used to send a representative to Dresdento read the German and English papers there.  At presentthree-quarters of the Czech papers and all the Slovak newspapershave been suppressed.  The columns of those which are still allowedto appear in Bohemia and Moravia are congested by mandates of thepolice and the military authorities, which the editors arecompelled to insert.  Recently the Government censorship has beenparticularly active against hooks, collections of national songs,and post-cards.  It has even gone so far as to confiscatescientific works dealing with Slav questions, Dostoyevski's novels,the books of Tolstoi and Millioukoff, and collections of purelyscientific Slav study and histories.The Government, however, have had to proceed to far greaterlengths.  By May, 1916, the death sentences of civilians pronouncedin Austria since the beginning of the war exceeded 4,000.  Ofthese, 965 were Czechs.  A large proportion of the condemned werewomen.  The total of soldiers executed amounts to several thousands.Is it not peculiar that among people which the Viennese propagandarepresents as loyal, hostages are taken in Bohemia, and condemnedto death, under the threat of execution if a popular movement takesplace?  The people are told of this and are given to understandthat the hostages have hopes for mercy if all is quiet.Not only have the authorities confiscated the property of allpersons convicted of political offences and of all Czechs who havefled from Austria-Hungary, but a system has been established bywhich the property of Czech soldiers who are prisoners in Russia isconfiscated.  The State profits doubly by this measure, for itfurther suppresses the allowances made to the families of thesesoldiers.  In order to terrorise its adversaries through suchmeasures, the Government instructs the Austrian newspapers topublish long lists of confiscations and other penalties.After a time, however, the Austrian Government practicallyabdicated in favour of the Prussians and now undertake to carry outthe measures of Germanisation dictated by Berlin.  The rights inconnection with the use of the Czech language in administration, inthe Law Courts and on the railways, rights which were won by thedesperate efforts of two generations of Czech politicians, havebeen abrogated.  The management of the railways has been placed inthe hands of Prussian military officials; the use of the Czechlanguage has been suppressed in the administration, where it hadformerly been lawful.  The Czechs have been denied access to theMagistrature and to public offices where they had occasionallysucceeded in directing the affairs in their own country.CHAPTER XVIISPIES AND SEMI-SPIESA comprehensive account of the German system of espionage wouldneed something resembling the dimensions of a generalencyclopaedia, but for the present I must endeavour to summarisethe subject in the course of a chapter.Spying is just as essential an ingredient of Prussian character asconceit, indifference to the feelings of others, jealousy, envy,self-satisfaction, conceit, industry, inquisitiveness, venerationfor officialdom, imitativeness, materialism, and the other nationalattributes that will occur to those who know Prussia, as distinctfrom the other German States.Prussian men and women hardly know the meaning of the word"private," and, as they have Prussianised to a great or less degreeall the other States of the Empire, they have inured the German topublicity from childhood upwards.In the enforcement of food regulations the hands of the Governmentin Germany are strengthened by certain elements in the Germancharacter, one of which is the tendency of people to spy upon eachother.  Here is a case.  Last Easter the customary baking ofcakes--a time-honoured ceremony in Germany---was forbidden all overPrussia from April 1 to 26.  A certain good woman of Stettin, whosehusband was coming home from the trenches, thought that she wouldwelcome her soldier with one of the cakes of which German men andwomen are so fond.  She foolishly displayed her treasure to aneighbour, who had dropped in for gossip.  The neighbour cut shortthe interview, went home to her telephone, called up the policeand, as she put it, did her duty.  I suppose from the German pointof view it is the duty of people to spy in each other's houses.From an Anglo-Saxon point of view it is something rather likesneaking at school.With these elements in their character, it is natural that theGermans should be past masters in the art of espionage.  It doesnot follow that they are equally successful in the deductionsformed from their investigations in foreign matters, but they areso egoistical and so literal, so fond of making reports, so fond ofseeing things only from their own point of view, that, while theymay be successful in obtaining possession by spying, purchase, ortheft, of the plans, say, of a new battleship, they are not able toform an accurate estimate of the character and intentions of thepeople among whom they may be spying.Their military spying is believed to be as perfect as such work canbe, marred occasionally by the contempt they feel for other nationsin military matters.  I presume that there is not much differencein the systems of various nations except that the German militaryspying is probably more thorough.It is also true that Germans of social distinction will often takepositions far beneath their rank in order to gather valuableinformation for their Government.  The case of the hall porter inthe _Hotel des Indes_, the most fashionable hotel in The Hague, isa notorious example.  He is of gentle birth, a brother of Baron vonWangenheim, late German Ambassador to Constantinople.In one of the most luxurious dining-saloons on one of the mostluxurious of the great German liners--I promised my trustworthyinformant not to be more definite--the man who was head-waiterduring the year preceding the war impressed those under him withbeing much more interested in some mysterious business ashore thanin his duties aboard ship.  He threw most of his work onsubordinates, who complained, though unsuccessfully, to themanagement.  Unlike other head-waiters and chief stewards, he wasnever aboard the ship when it was in port.  He was the only Germanin the dining-saloon, and he seemed to have great influence.  Heconversed freely with influential passengers of variousnationalities.The liner was in the English Channel eastward bound, when news camethat Germany had declared war upon Russia.  What little interest hehad previously displayed in his duties now vanished completely, andhe paced the deck more and more impatiently as the vessel nearedCuxhaven.  He was one of the first to go ashore, but before leavinghe turned to two of the stewards and exclaimed, "Good-bye.  I amgoing to Wilhelmshaven to take command of my cruiser."In general, the work of military attaches of all countries is addedto by more or less formal reports by officers who may be travellingon leave.  But German military spying goes much farther than this,for inasmuch as most Germans have been soldiers, the majority ofGermans travelling or resident in a foreign country are trainedobservers of military matters and, often act as semi-spies.The system of "sowing" Germans in foreign countries, as I haveheard it called in Germany, and getting them naturalised, was begunby Prussia before the war of 1866 against Austria.  It was sosuccessful under the indirect auspices of the Triumvirate--Moltke,Roon, and Bismarck--that it was developed in other countries.  Thusit is that, while there are comparatively few Frenchmen, forexample, naturalised in England, many German residents go throughthis more or less meaningless form just as suits their particularbusiness or the German Government, double nationality beingregarded as a patriotic duty to the Fatherland.There are, as a rule, three schools of German espionage in othercountries--the Embassy, the Consulates, and the individual spies,who have no connection with either and who forward their reportsdirect to Germany.There is a fourth class of fairly well-paid professional spies, menand women, of all classes, who visit foreign countries with lettersof introduction, who attend working-men's conventions, scientific,military, and other industrial congresses, receiving from 40 poundsto 100 pounds monthly by way of pay.  The case of Lody, whom theBritish caught and executed, was a type of the patriotic officerspy.  But his execution caused no real regret in Germany, for hewas regarded as a clumsy fellow, who roused the vigilance of theBritish authorities, with the result, I was informed in Germany, ofthe arrest and execution of several others, mostly, it is said,Dutch, South American, and other neutrals.The atmosphere of spying in business is a subtle and comparativelymodern form of German espionage, and has developed with theremarkable rise of German industry in the last quarter of acentury.  It fits in admirably with the Consular spy system, andlinks up Germans, naturalised and otherwise, in a chain which bindsthem together in a solidarity of workers for the cause.  TheDeutsche Bank and the Hamburg-Amerika Line were very potent enginesof espionage.Nor does the "Viktoria Insurance Company of Berlin" limit itsactivities to the kind of business suggested by the sign over thedoor.  A "Special Bureau" in the Avenue de l'Opera, Paris,consisted of German Reserve officers who spent a half-year or morein France.  As soon as one of these "finished his education" he wasreplaced by another Reserve officer.  Their duties took them onlong motor-trips through eastern France, strangely enough tolocalities which might be of strategic importance in the event ofwar.  It is not without significance that all the clerks of the"Special Bureau" left for Germany the day of mobilisation.Many of the semi-spies of the German commercial, musical, andtheatrical world are, from their point of view, honest workers andenthusiastic for German _Kultur_.  They recently fastened uponEngland, because the Germans for many years have been taught toregard this country as their next opponent.They are now as industrious in the United States as they were inEngland before the war, because those Germans who think they havewon the war believe that the United States is their next enemy.How active they have been in my country may be gathered from therevelations concerning Bernstorff, von Papen, Boyed, Dumba, theofficials of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and many others, whosemachinations have been revealed by the _New York World_ and otherjournals.It is the duty of the German Minister and his staff in any foreigncountry, and particularly in countries likely to become hostile, toget as close as possible to members of Governments, members ofLegislatures, leaders of thought and society, and members of thePress, especially the first and the last in this category.  CountBernstorff in the United States did exactly what Prince Lichnowskydid in Britain before the war, and, if I may say so, did it a greatdeal more successfully, though it is the plea of the Prince'sdefenders that he succeeded in making very powerful and permanentconnections in Great Britain,Our American Ambassadors, on the other hand, confine theirattention to strictly ambassadorial work, attend to the needs oftravelling Americans, and communicate with their Government onmatters vital to American interests.The excellent German Consular system, which has done so much tohelp German trade invaders in foreign countries, is openly a spybureau, and is provided in almost every important centre with itsown secret service fund.  Attached to it are spies and semi-spies,hotel-keepers, hairdressers, tutors, governesses, and employees inGovernment establishments, such as shipbuilding yards and armamentfactories.  It is a mistake to suppose that all these are Germans.Some, I regret to say, are natives of the laud in which the Germansare spying, mostly people who have got into trouble and with whomthe German agents have got into touch.  Such men, especially thosewho have suffered imprisonment, have often a grudge against theirown country and are easily caught in the spy net.Part of the system in England before the war was a commercialinformation bureau resembling the American Bradstreets and theEnglish Stubbs, by which, on payment of a small sum, the commercialstanding of any firm or individual can be obtained.  This bureau,which had its branches also in France and Belgium, closed itsactivities immediately prior to the war, the whole of thecard-indexes being removed to Berlin.It is the German boast, and I believe a legitimate one, that theyknow England better than do the English.  _Their error is inbelieving that in knowing England they know the English themselves_.At the outset of the war, when the Germans were winning, HerrAlbert Ulrich, of the Deutsche Bank, and chief of their OilDevelopment Department, speaking in perfect English, told me in arather heated altercation we had in regard to my country that heknew the United States and Great Britain very thoroughly indeed,and boasted that the American submarines, building at Fore River,of which the Germans had secured the designs, would be of littlevalue in the case of hostilities between Germany and the UnitedStates, which he then thought imminent.It is typical of German mentality that when I met him in Berlin,fifteen months later, he had completely altered his time as to thewar, and his tone was, "When is this dreadful war going to end?"This, however, is by the way.  Herr Ulrich is only an instance ofthe solidarity of Pan-Germanism.  An English or American bankervisiting a foreign country attends to his affairs and departs.  AGerman in a similar position is a sort of human ferret.  An hotelwith us is a place of residence for transient strangers.   TheHotel Adlon and others in Berlin are excellent hotels as such, butmixed up with spying upon strangers; Herr Adlon, senior, a friendof the Kaiser's, assists the Government spies when any important orsuspicious visitor registers.  The hotel telephones or any othertelephones are systematically tapped.  German soldiers are grantedspecial leave for hotel service--that is to say, hotel spying.When Belgium and France were invaded, German officers led their menthrough particular districts to particular houses with certainty,with knowledge gained by previous residence and spying.  I know anofficer with von Kluck's army who received the Iron Cross, FirstClass, for special information he had given to von Kluck whichfacilitated his progress through Belgium.Any German spies who may be working in England to-day have no greatdifficulty in communicating with Germany, though communication isslow and expensive.  They can do so by many routes and many means.As it is impossible to isolate Great Britain from Europe, it isequally impossible to prevent the conveyance of information to theenemy with more or less rapidity.  Agents of the variousbelligerent Powers are plentiful in Switzerland, Holland, Denmark,Norway and Sweden, and the United States.  So far as the maritimecountries are concerned, ships leave and enter daily.  It is quiteimpossible to control the movements of neutral sailors and othersengaged in these vessels.  To watch all the movements of all thosemen would require a detective force of impossible dimensions.  Thatinformation comes and goes freely by these channels is notorious.That all the sailors are legitimate sailors I do not believe, andas a matter of fact I know that they are not.The transmission of documents via Switzerland, Holland, Denmark,Sweden, and Norway has been rendered difficult, but not alwaysimpossible.  Cabling and telegraphing have been made very risky.Judging by the impatience manifested in certain quarters in Berlinat delay in getting news of Zeppelin raids, for example, I believethat the steps taken to delay communication between England andGermany have been effective, and delay in spy work is very oftenfatal to its efficiency.  The various tentacles of the German spysystem, its checks and counter-checks, whereby one spy watchesanother; whereby the naval spy system has no connection with themilitary spy system, and the political with neither, greatly marsits utility.Take one great question--the question that was all-important toGermany as to whether Great Britain would or would not enter thewar in the event of an invasion of Belgium or declaration of waragainst France.  I was informed on good Berlin authority that fromevery part of Great Britain and Ireland came different reports.So far as London was concerned, Prince Lichnowsky said "No."  Baronvon Kuhlmann was non-committal.  As a result Lichnowsky wasdisgraced and von Kuhlmann continued in favour.It is common knowledge in Berlin, and may be elsewhere, that themost surprised person in Germany at Great Britain's action was theKaiser, whose violent and continual denunciations of GreatBritain's Government, of King Edward, and King George, are repeatedfrom mouth to mouth in official circles with a sameness thatindicates accuracy.All the ignorance of Great Britain's intentions in 1914 is to methe best proof that the German minute system of working does notalways produce the result desired.As one with Irish blood in my veins, I found that Germany's Irishspy system (largely conducted by hotel waiters and active for morethan five and twenty years) had resulted in hopelessmisunderstanding of Irish affairs and Irish character, North andSouth.German spies are as a rule badly paid.  The semi-spies, such aswaiters, were usually "helped" by the German Government throughwaiters' friendly societies.  It was the duty of these men tocommunicate either in writing or verbally with the Consul, or withcertain headquarters either in Brussels or Berlin, and it is onlyin accordance with human nature that spies of that class, in orderto gain a reputation for acumen and consequent increase of pay,provided the kind of information that pleased the paymaster.  That,indeed, was one of the causes of the breakdown of the Germanpolitical spy system.  A spy waiter or governess in the County ofCork, for instance, who assiduously reported that a revolutionthroughout the whole of Ireland would immediately follow GreatBritain's entry into the war, received much more attention than thespy waiter in Belfast who told the authorities that if Germany wentto war many Irishmen would join England.  Ireland, I admit, is verydifficult and puzzling ground for spy work, but it was groundthoroughly covered by the Germans according to their methods.The military party in Germany, who are flaying von Bethmann-Hollwegfor his ignorance of the intentions of Britain's Dominions and ofIreland, never cease to throw in his teeth the fact that he hadmillions of pounds (not marks) at his hack to make the necessaryinvestigations, and that he failed.  That and his lack of the useof ruthlessness, his alleged three days' delay to mobilise in 1914,are the principal charges against him--charges which, in myopinion, may eventually result in his downfall.The great mob of semi-spies do not derive their whole income fromGermany, nor are they, I believe, all actually paid at regularintervals.  The struggling German shopkeeper in England was helped,and I have no doubt is still helped, by occasional sums receivedfor business development--sums nominally in the nature of donationsor loans from other Germans.  The army of German clerks, who cameto England and worked without salary between 1875 and 1900,received, as a rule, their travelling money and an allowance paiddirect from Germany, or, when in urgent need, from the Consul inLondon or elsewhere.  Their spying was largely commercial, althoughmany of them formed connections here which became valuable asGermany began to prepare directly for war with Britain.  They alsohelped to spread the knowledge of the English language which hasenabled Germany to analyse the country by means of its books,Blue-books, statistical publications, and newspapers.  They alsobrought back with them topographical and local knowledge thatsupplemented the military spy work later achieved by the Germanofficers who came to live here for spying purposes, and the greatarmy of _trained_ spy waiters, who are not to be confused with thesemi-spies in hotels, who drew small sums from Consuls.One of the finest pieces of spy work achieved by Germany was theobtaining by a German professor of a unique set of photographs ofthe whole of the Scottish coast, from north to south.  Thosephotographs showing every inlet and harbour, are now at theReichs-Marine-Amt (Admiralty) in the Leipsigerplatz.  They havebeen reproduced for the use of the Navy.  I do not know how theywere obtained.  I _know_ they are in existence, and they were takenfor geological purposes.Thefts of documents from British Government Departments are notalways successfully accomplished by German agents, I was told.Some of the more astute officials are alleged, especially by theNaval Department, to have laid traps and supplied the spies withpurposely misleading designs and codes.Assiduous fishing in the troubled waters around theWilhelmstrasse--waters that will become more and more troubled asthe siege of Germany proceeds--renders the gathering of informationnot so difficult as it might appear.By sympathising with the critics of the German Foreign Office inthe violent attacks upon the Government by the non-official SocialDemocrats, a sympathetic listener can learn a great deal.One thing I learned is that, beyond question, the German spysystem, in that misty period called "after the war," will he verycompletely revised.  The huge sums of money mentioned in theReichstag as having been expended on secret service have, so far asEngland is concerned, proved of no political value, and thetopographical and personal knowledge gained would only be ofservice in case of actual invasion and the consequent exactions ofransoms from individuals, cities, and districts.CHAPTER XVIIITHE IRON HAND IN ALSACE-LORRAINEThe state of affairs in Alsace-Lorraine is one of Germany's moatcarefully hidden secrets.In the first months of the war I heard so much talk inGermany--talk based upon articles in the Press--of how theAlsatians, like the rest of the Kaiser's subjects, "rushed to thedefence of the Fatherland," that I was filled with curiosity to goand see for myself if they had suddenly changed.  I could hardlybelieve that they had, for I had studied conditions in the "lostprovinces" before the war.Still, the Wilhelmstrasse propaganda was convincing millions thatthe Alsatians received the French very coldly when they invaded theprovince to Mulhouse, and that they greeted the German troops mostheartily when they drove back the invader.  Indeed, Alsatianfathers were depicted as rushing into the streets to cheer theGerman colours, while their wives and daughters "were so besidethemselves with joy that they hung upon the necks of the braveGerman Michaels, hailing them as saviours."A pretty picture of the appreciation of the blessings of Germanrule, but was it true?Some months later in Paris, when I stood in the Place de laConcorde before the Monument of Strassburg, covered with newmourning wreaths and a British flag now added, I felt anirresistible yearning to visit the closely guarded region ofsecrecy and mystery.On my subsequent trip to Germany I planned and planned day afterday how I could get into Alsace and go about studying actualconditions there.  When I told one American consul that I wished togo to Strassburg to see things for myself, he threw up his handswith a gesture of despair and reminded me that not an American orother consulate was allowed in Alsace-Lorraine, even in peace time.When I replied that I was determined to go he looked grave, andsaid earnestly: "Remember that you are going into a damn badcountry, and you go at your own, risk."It is extremely difficult for Germans, to say nothing offoreigners, to enter the fortress-city of Strassburg.  Businessmust be exceedingly urgent, and a military pass is required.  Aspecial pass is necessary to remain over night.How did I get into Strassburg in war-time?That is my own story, quite a simple one, but I do not propose totell it now except by analogy, in order not to get anybody intotrouble.During my last voyage across the ocean, which was on the Dutchliner _Rotterdam_, I went into the fo'castle one day to talk to astowaway, a simple young East Prussian lad, who had gone to sea andhad found himself in the United States at the outbreak of war."How on earth did you manage to pass through the iron-cladregulations at the docks of Hoboken (New York) without a permit,and why did you do it?" I asked."I was home-sick," he answered, "and I wanted to go back to Germanyto see my mother.  I got on board quite easily.  I noticed agentleman carrying his own baggage, and I said to him, 'Can I carryyour suitcases on board, sir?'"Once on board his knowledge of ships told him how to hide.Having myself stood for more than two hours on the quay in a longand growling queue of passengers, I could not but be amused by thesimple device by which this country youth had outwitted thestringent war embarkation regulations of war-time New York.  He wasin due course taken off by the British authorities at Falmouth, andis now probably enjoying the sumptuous diet provided at theAlexandra Palace or the Isle of Man.Well, that is not exactly how I got into Strassburg, but I got in.Night had fallen when I crossed the Rhine from Baden.  I wasconscious of an indescribable thrill when my feet touched the soilso sacred to all Frenchmen, and I somehow felt as if I were walkingin fairyland as I pushed on in the dark.  I had good fortune,arising from the fact that a great troop movement was taking place,with consequent confusion and crowding.On all sides from the surrounding girdle of forts the searchlightsswept the sky, and columns of weary soldiers tramped past me onthat four-mile road that led into Strassburg.  I kept as close tothem as possible with some other pedestrians, labourers returningfrom the great electric power plant.Presently I was alone on the road when suddenly a soldier lurchedfrom the shadows and accosted me.  I let him do the talking.  Butthere was no need to be alarmed; he was only a drunken stragglerwho had got separated from his company and wanted to know whetherany more troops were coming on.I had already passed through two cordons of functionaries outside,and felt little fear in Strassburg itself, so long as I was dulycautious.  I had thought out my project carefully.  I realised thatI must sleep in the open; for, unprovided with a pass it wasimpossible for me to go to an hotel.  Thankful that I was familiarwith my surroundings I wended my way to the beautiful park, theOrangerie, where I made myself comfortable in a clump of bushes andwatched the unceasing flash of searchlights criss-cross in the skyuntil I fell asleep.Next day I continued my investigations, but in Alsace as elsewheremy personal adventures are of no importance to the world unless, asin some instances, they throw light on conditions or are necessaryto support statements made, whereas the facts set down belong tothe history of the war.  Therefore I shall here summarise what Ifound in the old French province.The Germans have treated Alsace-Lorraine ruthlessly since theoutbreak of war is no part of the Empire is the iron hand soevident.  In Strassburg itself all signs of the French havedisappeared.  Readers who know the place well will remark that theywere vanishing before the war.  Externally they have now gonealtogether, but the hearts and spirit of the people are as before.What I saw reminded me of the words of a Social Democrat friend inBerlin, who told me that the Prussian Government determined, at thebeginning of the war that they would have no more Alsace-Lorraineproblem in the future.They have, therefore, sent the soldiers from these two provinces tothe most dangerous places at the various fronts.  One Alsaceregiment was hurled again and again at the old British Army on theYser in November, 1914, until at the end of a week only threeofficers and six men were left alive.  Some of the most perilouswork at Verdun, was forced upon the Alsatians.The Prussian authorities deliberately retain with the coloursAlsatians and Lorrainers unfit for military service, and woundedmen are not allowed to return to their homes.In the little circle to which I was introduced in Strassburg Italked with one sorrowing woman, who said that her son, obviouslyin an advanced state of tuberculosis, had been called up in spiteof protests.  He died within three weeks.  Another young man,suffering from haemorrhage of the lungs, was called up.  He wasforced to stand for punishment all one winter's day in the snow.In less than two months a merciful death in a military hospitalreleased him from the Prussian clutch.The town of Strassburg is a vast hospital.  I do not think I haveever seen so many Red Cross flags before.  They waved from theImperial Palace, the public library, the large and excellentmilitary hospitals, the schoolhouses, hotels, and privateresidences.  The Orangerie is thronged with convalescent wounded,and when hunger directed my steps to the extensive Park RestaurantI found it, too, converted into a hospital.  Even the large concertroom was crowded with cots.The glorious old sandstone Cathedral, with its gorgeous facade andlace-like spire, had a Red Cross flag waving over the nave while awireless apparatus was installed on the spire.  Sentries pacedbackwards and forwards on the uncompleted tower, which dominatesthe region to the Vosges.The whole object of Prussia is to eliminate every vestige of Frenchinfluence in the two provinces.  The use of the French language,whether in speech or writing, is strictly forbidden.  To print,sell, offer for sale, or purchase anything in French is to commit acrime.  Detectives are everywhere on the alert to discoverviolations of the law.  All French trade names have been changed totheir German equivalents.  For example, the sign _Guillaume Rondee,Tailleur_, has come down, and if the tradesman wants to continue inhis business _Wilhelm Rondee, Schneider_, must go up.  He may havea quantity of valuable business forms or letter-heads inFrench--even if they contain only one French word they must bedestroyed.  And those intimate friends who are accustomed toaddress him by his first name must bear in mind that it is_Wilhelm_.Eloise was a milliner at the outbreak of the war.  Today, if shedesires to continue her business, she is obliged to remove thefinal "e" and thus Germanise her name.After having been fed in Berlin on stories of Alsatian loyalty tothe Kaiser, I was naturally puzzled by these things.   If Guillaumehad rushed into the street to cheer the German colours when theFrench were driven back, and Eloise had hung upon the neck of theGerman Michael, was it not rather ungrateful of the Prussianssubsequently to persecute them even to the stamping out of theirnames?  Not only that, but to be so efficient in hate that eveninscriptions on tombstones may no longer be written in French?Alsace-Lorraine is to be literally _Elsass-Lothringen_ to the lastdetail.The truth of the matter is that the Alsatians greeted the French asdeliverers and were depressed when they fell back.   This, as mightbe expected, exasperated Prussia, for it was a slap in the face forher system of government by oppression.  Thus, at the very timethat the _Nachrichtendienst_ (News Service) connected with theWilhelmstrasse was instructing Germans and neutrals that theAlsatians' enthusiastic reception of German troops was evidence oftheir approval of German rule, the military authorities wereposting quite a different kind of notice in Alsace, a notice whichreveals the true story."During the transport of French prisoners of war a portion of thepopulace has given expression to a feeling of sympathy for theseprisoners and for France.  This is to inform all whom it mayconcern that such expressions of sympathy are criminal andpunishable, and that, should they again, take place, the personstaking part in them will be proceeded against by court-martial, andthe rest of the inhabitants will be summarily deprived of theprivileges they now enjoy."All crowding around prisoners of war, conversations with them,cries of welcome and demonstrations of sympathy of all kinds, aswell as the supply of gifts, is strictly prohibited.  It is alsoforbidden to remain standing while prisoners are being conducted orto follow the transport."The result of the persecution of the French-speaking portion of thepopulation has been a boomerang for Prussia.  The Germans of theregion, most of whom never cared much for Prussia, are now bitterlyhostile to her, and thus it is that all citizens of Alsace, whetherFrench or German, who go into other parts of Germany are under thesame police regulations as alien enemies.In order to permit military relentlessness to proceed smoothlywithout any opposition, the very members of the local Parliament,the Strassburg Diet, are absolutely muzzled.  They have beencompelled to promise not to criticise at any time, or in any way,the military control; otherwise their Parliament will be closed.As for the local Councils, they are not allowed to discuss anypolitical questions whatsoever.  A representative of the police ispresent at every meeting to enforce this rule to the letter.The people do not even get the sugared Reichstag reports, as doesthe rest of Germany.  These are specially re-censored at Mulhouse.The official reports of the General Staff are often days late, andsometimes do not appear at all.  In no part of the war zone isthere so much ignorance about what is happening at the variousfronts as in the two "lost provinces."Those who do not sympathise with Germany in her career of conquestupon which she so joyfully and ruthlessly embarked in August, 1914,may well point to Alsace-Lorraine as an argument against theprobability of other peoples delighting in the rule which she wouldforce upon them.She has become more intolerant, not less, in the old Frenchprovinces.  It will be recalled that by the Treaty of Frankfurt,signed in March, 1871, they became a "Reichsland," that is, anImperial Land, not a self-governing State like Bavaria, Saxony, orWurttemberg.  As Bismarck bluntly and truly said to the Alsatiandeputies in the Reichstag: "It is not for _your_ sakes nor in_your_ interests that we conquered you, but in the interests of theEmpire."For more than forty years Prussia has employed every means butkindness to Germanise the conquered territory.  But though she hashushed every syllable of French in the elementary schools andforced the children to learn the German language and history only;though freedom of speech, liberty of the Press, rights of publicmeeting, have been things unknown; though even the little childrenplaying at sand castles have been arrested and fined if in theirenthusiasm they raised a tiny French flag, or in the excitement oftheir mock contest cried "Vive la France!"; though men and womenhave been fined and thrown into prison for the most triflingmanifestations that they had not become enthusiastic for theirrulers across the Rhine; and though most of the men fillingGovernment positions--and they are legion--are Prussians, theAlsatians preserve their individuality and remain uncowed.Having failed in two score of years to absorb them by force,Prussia during the war has sought by scientific methods carried toany extreme to blot out for ever themselves and their spirit.To do the German credit, I believe that he is sincere when hebelieves that his rule would be a benefit to others and that he isgenuinely perplexed when he discovers that other people do not likehis regulations.  The attitude which I have found in Germanytowards other nationalities was expressed by Treitschke when hesaid, "We Germans know better what is good for Alsace than theunhappy people themselves."The German idea of how she should govern other people is ananachronism.  This idea, which I have heard voiced all overGermany, was aptly set forth before the war by a speaker on "TheDecadence of the British Empire," when he sought to prove suchdecadence by citing the fact that there was only one Britishsoldier to every 4,000 of the people of India.  "Why," heconcluded, "Germany has more soldiers in Alsace-Lorraine alone thanGreat Britain has in all India."That is a bad spirit for the world, and it is a bad spirit forGermany.  She herself will receive one great blessing from the warif it is hammered out of her.CHAPTER XIXTHE WOMAN IN THE SHADOWThe handling of the always difficult question of the eternalfeminine was firmly tackled by the German Government almostimmediately after the outbreak of war.To understand the differences between, the situation here and in,Germany it is necessary first to have a little understanding of theGerman woman and her status.  With us, woman is treated assomething apart, something on a pedestal.  In Germany and inAustria the situation is reversed.  The German man uses his home asa place to eat and sleep in, and be waited upon.  The attitude ofthe German woman towards the man is nearly always that of theobedient humble servant to command.  If a husband and wife are outshopping it is often enough the wife who carries the parcels.  Inentering any public place the middle-class man walks first and thewife dutifully follows.  When leaving, it is the custom for the manto be helped with his coat before the woman.  Indeed, she isgenerally left to shift for herself.Woman is the under sex, the very much under sex, in Germany,regarded by the man as his plaything or as his cook-wife and nurseof his children; and she will continue to be the under sex untilshe develops pride enough to assert herself.  She accepts herinferiority without murmur; indeed, she often impresses one asdelighting in it.It is no dishonour for a girl of the middle or lower class to havea liaison with some admirer, particularly if he is a student or ayoung officer; in fact, it is quite the proper thing for him to bewelcomed by her parents, although it is perfectly well understoodthat he has not the slightest idea of marrying her.  The girls aredoing their part to help along the doctrine of free love, thepreaching and practice of which are so greatly increasing in themodern German State.After marriage the woman's influence in the world is nearly zero.The idolatry of titles is carried to an extreme in Germany whichgoes from the pathetic to the ludicrous.  One does not address aGerman lady by her surname, as Frau Schmidt, but by her husband'stitle or position, as Frau Hauptmann (Mrs. Captain), Frau Doktor,Frau Professor, Frau Bakermeister (Mrs. Bakershopowner), or evenFrau Schornsteinfegermeister (Mrs. Master Chimneysweep), althoughher husband may be master over only some occasional juvenileassistant.  In military social functions, and they are of dailyoccurrence in garrison towns, Mrs. Colonel naturally takesprecedence in all matters over the wives and daughters of othermembers of the regiment.  Contemplate the joyful existence of avivacious American or British girl, accustomed to the respectfulconsideration of the other sex, married to a young lieutenant andruled over by all the wives of his superior officers!To try to marry money is considered praiseworthy and correct inGerman military circles.  In Prussia a lieutenant in peace timesreceives for the first three years 60 pounds a year, from thefourth to the sixth year 85 pounds, from the seventh to the ninthyear 99 pounds, from the tenth to the twelfth year 110 pounds, andafter the twelfth year 130 pounds a year.  A captain receives fromthe first to the fourth year 170 pounds, from the fifth to theeighth year 230 pounds, and the ninth year and after 355 pounds.Thus it is that no young lady, however ugly, need be without anofficer husband if she has money enough to buy one.  If he has nota private income, the Government forbids him to marry until his payis sufficient.  That point is seldom reached before he isthirty-five years of age.  Marriage helps him out of thedifficulty, and since the army is so deified in the Fatherland thatthe highest ambition of nearly every girl is to marry an officer,his opportunity of trading shoulder-knots for a dowry is excellent.The efforts of some women to increase their fortune sufficiently toenable them to invest in a military better-half are pathetic froman Anglo-Saxon point of view.  One woman who requested an interviewwith me said that as I was an American correspondent I might beable to advise her how she could dispose of a collection ofautographs to some American millionaire.  She explained that herfinancial condition was not so good as formerly, but she wasdesperate to better it as she was in love with an officer, who,although he loved her, would have to marry another if she could notincrease her income.  The autographs she showed me were from PrinceHenry of Prussia, Prince Bulow and other notables, and most of themwere signed to private letters.Take the story of Marie and Fritz, both of whom I knew in agarrison city in eastern Germany.  Nothing could illustrate betterthe difference between the German attitude and our own on certainmatters.  She was a charming, lovable girl of nineteen engaged toan impecunious young lieutenant a few years older.  They moved inthe best circle in the _Garnisonstadt_.Two years after their engagement her father lost heavily inbusiness and could no longer afford to settle 5,000 pounds on herto enable them to marry.It mattered not; theirs was true love, and they would wait untilhis pay was sufficient,All went well until another girl, as unattractive as Marie wascharming, decided that she would try to buy Fritz as a husband.After four months of her acquaintance he found time at the end of aday's drill to write a few lines informing the young lady, nineyears of whose life he had monopolised, of his intention to marrythe new rival.  Life became black for Marie, the more as sherealised that she and Fritz had only to wait a little longer andhis pay would be sufficient.How would Fritz be regarded in this country, and how was heregarded according to German standards?  That is what makes thestory worth telling.  With us such a man as Fritz would have beencut socially and there would have been great sympathy for the sweetgirl whose years had been wasted.  But on the other side of theRhine women exist solely for the comfort of men.  In militaristicGermany Fritz lost not an iota of the esteem of his friends ofeither sex; as for Marie, she had failed in a fair game, that wasall.  The girl's mother even excused his conduct by saying that hewas ambitious to get ahead in the army.  Like most of her sex inGermany she has been reared to venerate the uniform so much thatanything done by the man who wears it is quite excusable.  Indeed,Marie's mother still listens with respectful approval at_Kaffeeklatsch_ to Fritz's mother when she boasts of what her sonis doing as a major over Turkish troops.German women have many estimable qualities, but a proper amount ofindependence and pride is noticeably foreign to their natures.  Isit surprising that the American girl of German parents requiresonly a very brief visit to the Fatherland to convince her that thecareer of the _Hausfrau_ is not attractive.On the whole, the efforts of the German woman have almost doubledthe national output of war energy.  Except in Berlin few are idle,and these only among the newly-rich class.  The women of the upperclasses, both in Germany and Austria, are either in hospitals orare making comforts for the troops.  Women have always workedharder in Germany and at more kinds of work than in Britain or theStates, and what, judging by London illustrated papers, seems to bea novelty--the engagement of women in agricultural and otherpursuits--is just the natural way of things in Germany.  It shouldalways be remembered, when estimating German man-power and Germanability to hold out, that the bulk of the work of civil life isbeing done by prisoners and women.  A German woman and a prisonerof war, usually a Russian, working side by side in the fields is acommon sight throughout Germany.It is the boast of the Germans that their building constructionsare going on as usual.  I have myself seen plenty of evidence ofthis, such as the grading of the Isar at Munich, the completion ofthe colossal railway station at Leipzig, the largest in Germany,the construction of the new railway station at Gorlitz, thecomplete building since the war of the palatial Hotel Astoria atLeipzig, also two gigantic new steel and concrete palaces in thesame city for the semi-annual fair, the erection of a newHamburg-America Line office building adjacent to the old one anddwarfing it.  The slaughter-house annexes, contracted for in daysof peace, continue their slow growth, although Berlin has nopresent need for such extension in these half-pound-of-meat-a-weektimes.The construction of the Nord-Sud Bahn of the underground railway,for linking up the north and south sections of Berlin has proceededright along, the women down in the pit with picks and shovels doingthe heavy work of navvies.  That department of the GermanGovernment whose duty it is to enlighten Neutrals is not too proudof the fact, surprisingly enough.  An American kinematographoperator, Mr. Edwards, of Mr. Hearst's papers, was desirous oftaking a film of these women navvies--heavy, sad creatures theyare.  The Government stepped in and suggested that, although theyhad no objection to a personally conducted and posed picture--inwhich the women would no doubt smile to order--they could notpermit the realities of this unwomanly task to be shown in the formof a truth-telling moving picture.German authorities are utilising every kind of woman.  The socialevil, against which the Bishop of London and others are agitatingin England, was effectively dealt with by the German authorities,not only for the sake of the health of the troops, but in theinterests of munitions.   Women of doubtful character were firsttold that if found in the neighbourhood of barracks or in cafesthey were liable to be arrested, and when so found were immediatelyremoved to their native places, and put into the nearest cartridgefilling or other shop.  The double effect has been an increasedoutput of munitions for the army and increased health for thesoldier, and such scenes as one may witness in Piccadilly or otherLondon streets at night have been effectively squelched by thestrong Prussian hand, with benefit to all concerned.I am not speaking of German morals in general, which are notorious.I merely state the practical way the Germans turn the women of thestreet into useful munition makers.The lot of the German woman has been much more difficult than thelot of her sister in the Allied countries, for upon her has fallenthe great and increasing burden of the struggle to get enough toeat for her household.  In practically all classes of Germany ithas been the custom of the man to come home from his work, whetherin a Government office, bank, or factory, for his midday meal,usually followed by an hour's sleep.The German man is often a greedy fellow as regards meals.  For himspecial food is always provided, and the wife and children sitround patiently watching him eat it.  He expects special foodto-day.  The soldier, of course, is getting it, and properly, butthe stay-at-homes, who are men over forty-five or lads undernineteen, still get the best of such food as can be got.Exceptions to the nineteen to forty-five rule are very few indeed.National work in Germany means war work pure and simple, and nowthe women are treated exactly as the men in this respect, exceptthat they will not be sent to the front.In January, 1917, Germany at length began formally to organise thewomen of the country to help in the war.  Each of the six chiefarmy "commands" throughout the Empire now has a woman attached toit as Directress of the "Division for Women's Service." Hitherto,as in England, war work by women has been entirely voluntary.  ThePatriotic Auxiliary Service (Mass Levy) Law is not compulsory sofar as female labour is concerned.  German women, however, havingproclaimed that they regard themselves liable for national serviceunder the spirit if not the letter of the law, it has finally beendecided to mobilise their services on a more systematic basis thanin the past.None of the countless revolutions in German life produced by thewar outstrips in historical importance this official linking up ofwomen with the military machine.  Equally striking is the fact thatthe directresses of Women's Service, who hold office in Berlin,Breslau, Magdeburg, Coblenz, Konigsberg, and Karlsruhe, are allfeminist leaders and promoters of the women's emancipationmovement.  The directress for the Mark of Brandenburg (theBerlin-Potsdam district) is an able Jewess named Dr. Alice Salomon,who is one of the pioneers of the German women's movement.  Themain object of the "Women's Service" Department is to organisefemale labour for munitions and other work from which men can beliberated for the fighting line.I have nothing but praise and admiration for the way in which theGerman women have thrown themselves into this struggle.  Believingimplicitly as they have been told--and with the exception of thelower classes, after more than two years of war, they believeeverything the Government tells them--that this war was carefullyprepared by "Sir Grey" (Lord Grey of Fallodon), "the man without aconscience," as he is called in Germany, they feel that they arehelping to fight a war for the defence of their homes and theirchildren, and the cynics at the German Foreign Office, whomanufacture their opinions for them, rub this in in sermons fromthe pastors, novels, newspaper articles, faked cinema films,garbled extracts from Allied newspapers, books, and bogusphotographs, Reichstag orations by Bethmann-Hollweg, and the restof it, not forgetting the all-important lectures by the professors,who are unceasing in their efforts all over Germany.To show how little the truth of the war is understood by the Germanwomen, I may mention an incident that occurred at the house ofpeople of the official class at which I was visiting one day.  Theeldest son, who was just back from the Somme trenches, sufferingfrom slight shell-shock, brought home a copy of a Londonillustrated paper, which had been thrown across the trenches by theEnglish.  In this photograph there was a picture of a longprocession of German prisoners captured by the English.  Thedaughter of the house, a well-read girl of nineteen, blazed up atthe sight of this photograph, and showed it to her mother, who wasequally surprised.  The son of the house remarked, "Surely you knowthe English have taken a great many prisoners?"His mother, realising her mistake, looked confused, and simplysaid, "I didn't think."  In other words, the obvious fact thatGermans were sometimes captured had never been pointed out to herby the Government, and most Germans are accustomed to think onlywhat they are officially told to think.While there are an increasing number of doubters among the Germanmales as to the accuracy of statements issued by the Government, inthe class with which I mostly came into contact in Germany, thewomen are blindfold and believe all they are told.  So strong, too,is the influence of Government propaganda on the people in Germanythat in a town where I met two English ladies married to Germans,they believed that Germany had Verdun in her grasp, had annihilatedthe British troops (mainly black) on the Somme, had defeated theBritish Fleet in the battle of Skagerrak (Jutland), and reduced thegreater part of the fortifications, docks, and munition factoriesof London to ruins by Zeppelins.Their anguish for the fate of their English relations was sincere,and they were intensely hopeful that Britain would accept any sortof terms of peace in order to prevent the invasion which somepeople in Germany still believe possible.At the beginning of the war the click of the knitting needle washeard everywhere; shop-girls knitted while waiting for customers,women knitted in trams and trains, at theatres, in churches, and,of course, in the home.  The knitting is ceasing now for the verypractical reason that the military authorities have commandeeredall the wool for the clothing of the soldiery.  A further reasonfor the stoppage of such needlework is the fact that women areengaged in countless forms of definite war work.Upon the whole it is beyond question that the German women are notstanding the losses as well as the British women.  I have beenhonoured in England by conversations with more than one lady whohas lost many dear ones.  The attitude is quieter here than inGermany, and is not followed by the peace talk which such eventsproduce in German households.What surprises me in England is the fact that the word "peace" ishardly ever mentioned anywhere, whereas in any German railway trainor tramcar the two dominant words are Friede (peace) and Essen(food).  The peace is always a German idea of peace--for theextreme grumblers do not talk freely in public--and the food talkis not always the result of the shortage, but of the greatdifficulty in getting what is to be obtained, together with theincreasing monotony of the diet.It must not be supposed, however, that the life of feminine Germanyis entirely a gloomy round of duty and suffering.  Among the womenof the poor, things are as bad as they can be.  They are gettinghigher wages than ever, but the food usury and the blockade robthem of the increase.The middle and upper classes still devote a good deal of time tothe feminine pursuits of shopping and dressing.  The outbreak ofwar hit the fashions at a curious moment.  Paris had just abandonedthe tight skirt, and a comical struggle took place between theGovernment and those women who desired to be correctly gowned.The Government said, "In order to avoid waste of material, you muststick to the tight skirt," and the amount of cloth allowed wascarefully prescribed.  Women's desire to be in the mode was,however, too powerful for even Prussianism.  Copies of Frenchfashion magazines were smuggled in from Paris through Switzerland,passed from dressmaker to dressmaker, and house to house, anddespite the military instructions and the leather shortage, wideskirts and high boots began to appear everywhere,This feminine ebullition was followed by an appeal from theGovernment to abandon all enemy example and to institute new Germanfashions of their own making.  Models were exhibited in shopwindows of what were called the "old and elegant Viennesefashions."  These, however, were found to be great consumers ofmaterial, and the women still continued to imitate Paris.The day before I left Berlin I heard an amusing conversation in theunderground railway between two women, one of whom was talkingabout her hat.  She told her friend that she found the picture ofthe hat in a smuggled fashion paper, and had it made at hermilliner's and she was obviously very pleased with her taste.The women in the munition factories, who number millions, wear aserviceable kind of uniform overall.The venom of the German women in regard to the war is quite incontrast to the feeling expressed by English women.  They have reada great deal about British and American women and they cordiallydetest them.  Their point of view is very difficult to explain.When I have told German women that in many States in my countrywomen have votes, their reply is, "How vulgar!"  Their attitudetowards the whole question of women's franchise is that it is aform of Anglo-Saxon lack of culture and lack of authority.The freedom accorded to English and American girls is entirelymisunderstood.  A Dutch girl who, in the presence of some Germanladies, expressed admiration for certain aspects of Englishfeminine life, was fiercely and venomously attacked by thatnever-failing weapon, the German woman's tongue.  The poor thing,who mildly expressed the view that hockey was a good game forgirls, and the fine complexions and elegant walk of English womenwere due to outdoor sports, was reduced almost to tears.The intolerance of German women is almost impossible to express.  Iknow a case of one young girl, a German-American, whose parentsreturned to Hamburg, who declined to repeat the ridiculous Germanformula, "Gott strafe England," and stuck to her point, with theresult that she was not invited to that circle again.To the cry "Gott strafe England" has been added "Gott strafeAmerika," the latter being as popular with the German women as theGerman men.  The pastors, professors, and the Press have told theGerman women that their husbands and sons and lovers are beingkilled by American shells.  A man who ought to know better, likePrince Rupert of Bavaria, made a public statement that half of theAllies' ammunition is American.  After the British and Frenchautumn offensive of 1915 the feeling against America on the part ofGerman women became so intense that the American flag had to bewithdrawn from the American hospital at Munich, although thathospital, supported by German-American funds, has done wonderfulwork for the German wounded.Arguments with German women about the war are absolutely futile.They follow the war very closely after their own method, andbelieve that any defeats, such as on the Somme or Verdun, aretactical rearrangements of positions, dictated by the wisdom of theGeneral Staff, and so long as no Allied troops are upon German soilso long will the German populace believe in the invincibility ofits army.  I am speaking always of the middle and upper classes,who are on the whole, but with increasing exceptions, as intenselypro-war as the lower classes are anti-war.The modern German Bible is the _Zeitung_ (the rough translation ofwhich is "newspaper") and German women are even more fanatical thanthe men, if possible, in their worship of it.On one occasion, when I candidly remarked that von Papen and Boy-Edcame back to the Fatherland for certain unbecoming acts, some ofwhich I enumerated, a Frau Hauptmann jumped to her feet and, afterthe customary brilliant manner of German argument, shrieked that Iwas a liar.  She declared that their _Zeitung_ had said nothingabout the charges I mentioned, therefore they, were not true.  Shefurthermore promised to report me to Colonel ------ at the_Kriegsministerium_ (War Office), and she kept her word.The neglect, and, in some cases refusal, to attend the Britishwounded by German nurses are a sign both of their own intensity offeeling in regard to the war and their entirely differentmentality.  Again and again I have heard German women say, "In theevent of a successful German invasion of England the women willaccompany the men, and teach the women of England that war is war."Their remarks in regard to the women of my own country are equallyoffensive.  Indeed, States that Germany regards as neutral, and whoare treated by the officially controlled German Press with acertain amount of respect, are loathed by German women.  Theirattitude is that all who are not on their side are their enemies.American women who are making shells for the British, French, andRussians are just as much the enemies of Germany as the Alliedsoldiers and sailors.  One argument often used is that to bestrictly neutral America should make no munitions at all, but itwould not be so bad, say the Germans, if half the Americanammunition went to Germany and half to the Allies.I lost my temper once by saying to one elderly red-faced Frau,"Since you have beaten the British at sea, why don't you send yourships to fetch it?"  "Our fleet," she said, "is too busy chokingthe British Fleet in its safe hiding places to afford time to go toAmerica.  You will see enough of our fleet one day, remember that!"Summing up this brief and very sketchy analysis of Germanfemininity in the war, I reiterate views expressed on previousvisits to Germany, that German women are not standing the anxietyof the war as well as those of France and Britain.They have done noble work for the Fatherland, but the grumblings ofthe lower third of the population are now such as have not beenheard since 1848.  German officials in the Press Department of theForeign Office try to explain the unrest away to foreigncorrespondents like myself, but many thinking Germans are surprisedand troubled by this unexpected manifestation on the part of thosewho for generations have been almost as docile and easily managedas children.CHAPTER XXTHE WAR SLAVES OF ESSENEssen, the noisiest town in the world, bulks largely in theimagination of the Entente Allies, but "Essen" is not merely onecity.  It is a centre or capital of a whole group of arsenal towns.Look at your map of Germany, and you will see how temptingly nearthey are to the Dutch frontier.  Look at the proximity of Hollandand Essen, and you will understand the Dutch fear of Germany.  Youwill grasp also the German fear, real as well as pretended, thatthe battle of the Somme may one day be accompanied by a thrust atthe real heart of Germany, which, is Westphalia--Westphalia withits coal and iron and millions of trained factory hands.I saw when in Germany extracts from speeches by British politiciansin which the bombing of Essen by air was advocated.  Perhaps thetask would have been easier if the bombing had come first and thespeeches afterwards.  Forewarned, forearmed; and Essen is now verymuch armed.All German railroads seem to lead to this war monster.  Attached toalmost every goods train in Germany you will see wagons marked"Essen--special train."  Wagons travel from the far ends of Austriaand into Switzerland, which is showing its strict neutrality bymaking munitions for both sides.On the occasion of my second visit to Essen during the war Iarrived at night.  It was before the time of the bombing speeches,and, though it was well into the hours when the world is asleep,the sky glowed red with a glare that could be seen for full thirtymiles.  My German companion glowed also, as he opened the carriagewindow and bade me join him in a peep at what we were coming to."This is the place where we make the stuff to blow the world topieces," he proudly boasted.  "If our enemies could only see thatthe war would be over."I suggested that Essen was not the only arsenal.  There were, forinstance, Woolwich, Glasgow, Newcastle, Creusot, and in my ownstrictly neutral country Bethlehem, Bridgeport, and one or twoother humble hamlets.  He brushed aside my remarks, "But we havealso here is this very region Dortmund, Bochum, Witten, Duisburg,Krefeld, Dusseldorf, Solingen, Elberfeld and Barmen."As we approached nearer, freight trains, military trains andpassenger trains were everywhere.  Officers and soldiers crowdedthe station platforms, and though it was night the activity ofthese Rhenish-Westphalian arsenal towns impressed me with thebelief that unless the British blockade can strictly excludeessentials, such as copper and nickel, especially from theirroaring factories, the war will be needlessly protracted.It is not necessary to be long in Rhineland and Westphalia torealise that a shortage in these and other essentials is much moredisturbing to the heads of these wonderful organisations than thefear of aerial bombs.On the occasion of my first war-time visit to Essen it would havebeen easy to have bombed it.  There is an old saying that ashoemaker's children are the worst shod, and the display ofanti-aircraft guns which has since manifested itself was thennon-existent.   The town was ablaze.  It is still ablaze, but thelighting has been cunningly arranged to deceive nocturnal visitors,and any aeroplanes approaching Essen at a height of twelve orfifteen thousand feet would find it hard to discover which wasEssen, and which Borbeck, and which was Steele.Mulheim is easily found, because it is close to the River Ruhr.  Wehad to halt a long time outside the station of Essen, so great wasthe pressure of traffic.  The cordon surrounding the entrance tothe city is some distance away, and having passed that safely I hadno fear of being again interrogated.I told the hotel manager that I was a travelling newspapercorrespondent, and should like to see as many as possible, of thewonders of his town.  After praise of his hostelry, which, as thesub-manager said, was too good for the Essenites, I set out on mytravels to see the sights of the city, foremost among them beingthe regulation statue of William I.It was easy to find Krupps, for I had only to turn my steps towardsthe lurid panorama in the sky.  As I came nearer, not only my senseof sight but my sense of hearing told me that Germany's greatarsenal was throbbing with unwonted life.  The crash and din ofmighty steam hammers and giant anvils, the flame and flash ofroaring blast furnaces, the rumbling of great railway truckstrundling raw and finished products in and out, chimneys of dizzyheight belching forth monster coils of Cimmerian smoke, seem totransport one from the prosaic valley of the Ruhr into thedeafening realm of Vulcan and Thor.  The impression of Krupps bynight is ineffaceable.  The very air exudes iron and energy.  Youcan almost imagine yourself in the midst of a thunderous artilleryduel.  You are at any rate in no doubt that the myriad of hands atwork behind those carefully guarded walls are even more vitalfactors in the war than the men in the firing line.  The blaze androar fill one with the overpowering sense of the Kaiser's limitlessresources for war-making.  For you must roll Sheffield andNewcastle-on-Tyne and Barrow-in-Furness into one clanging whole tovisualise Essen-on-the-Ruhr.In some way Essen is unlike any other town I have visited.  It hasits own internal network of railways, running to and from thevarious branches of Krupps, and as the trains pass across thestreets they naturally block the traffic for some minutes.  Theyare almost continuous and the pedestrians' progress is slow, but itis exciting, for it is here that one realises what it means to beat war with Germany.  If the resolution of the German people wereas rigid as the steel in the great cranes and rolling mills, theAllied task would be impossible.The brief noon-tide rush of the workpeople resembles our sixo'clock rush in America towards Brooklyn Bridge.  I can say no morethan that.  There is nothing like it in London.  The home-goingcrowd round the Bank of England does not compare with the Essencrowd, because the crowd at Essen is for a few minutes moreconcentrated.  Old and young, men and women, refugees and prisonersof several nationalities (I saw no British), Poles and Russianspredominating, grimy, worn, and weary, they pour out in a solidmass, and cover the tramcars like bees in swarming time.  Thepedestrians gradually break up into little companies, most of themgoing to Kronenberg and other model colonies founded by FrauKrupp--"Bertha," as she is affectionately called throughoutGermany.  The highest honour the Germans can bestow upon her is toname their 16-inch howitzer "Fat Bertha."  Frau Bertha Krupp, itmay be well to recall, was the heiress to the great Krupp fortune,and on her marriage in 1906 to Herr von Bohlen und Halbach, adiplomatist, he changed his name to Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.Though a private corporation with 12,500,000 pounds share capitalowned by the "Cannon Queen" and her family, it is to all intentsand purposes a Government Department just as Woolwich Arsenal is anadjunct of the British War Office.  In the past, as the elaboratecentenary (1910) memorial proudly recites, fifty-two Governmentsthroughout the world have bought Krupp guns, armour, shells, andwarships, with Germany by far the biggest customer.Out of the stupendous profits of war machines the Krupps have builtworkpeople's houses that, as regards material comfort, would not beeasy to excel.  These houses are provided with ingeniouscoal-saving stoves, that might well be copied elsewhere, for thoughEssen is in the coal centre of Germany, they are just as carefulabout coal as though it were imported from the other end of theworld.Frau Bertha and her husband (a simple and modest man, who is, I wasinformed, entirely in the hands of his specialists, and who has thewisdom to let well alone) have put up a big fight with Batocki, thefood dictator.  The semi-famine had not reached its height when Iwas in Essen, and the suffering was not great there.  Amunition-maker working in any of the Rhenish-Westphalian towns isregarded by Germans as a soldier.  As the war has proceeded he hasbeen subject to continuous combing out.The amount of food allowed to those engaged in these greatfactories and rolling mills is, I estimate, 33 per cent. more thanthat allowed to the rest of the civil population.  In all thenotices issued throughout Germany in regard to further foodrestrictions, there is appended the line, "This change is necessaryowing to the need for fully supplying your brothers in the army andthe munition works."Essen is a town that before the war had a population exceeding300,000.  A conservative estimate makes the figure to-day nearlyhalf a million.  The Krupp Company employ about 120,000.  Aprevalent illusion is that Krupps confine their war-time effortexclusively to making war material.  That is a mistake.  Aconsiderable part of Krupp's work is the manufacture of articleswhich can be exchanged for food and other products in neighbouringcountries, thus taking the place of gold.  At Lubeck, I saw thequays crowded with the products of Essen in the shape of steelgirders and other building machinery going to Sweden in exchangefor oil, lime from Gotland, iron ore, paper, wood, and foodproducts,A mining engineer of the great mines at Kiruna, Lapland, told methat he had just given an order for steam shovels from theWestphalian manufacturers, who are also sending into Holland knivesand scissors and other cutlery and tools.Germany's principal bargaining commodities with contiguous neutralnations are steel building materials, coal, and dye-stuffs.  Coaldug in Belgium by Belgian miners is a distinct asset for Germany,when she exchanges it for Swiss cattle, Dutch cheese, and Swedishwood.   When we consider that the great industrial combinations ofRhineland and Westphalia are not only reaping enormous munitionprofits, but supply the steel and coal which form the bulk ofGerman war-time exports, we can easily understand why some SocialDemocrats grew dissatisfied because the all-powerful NationalLiberals resisted a war profits tax for two years.  It isnoteworthy that several of the more outspoken German editors havebeen suspended for attacking these profiteers.I should qualify this statement of exports slightly by saying thatthey pertained up to November, 1916.  The effort to put more thanten million men into military uniform resulted not only in theslave-raids in Belgium but in a concentration in munition outputthat stopped further exports of steel products and coal on a largescale.We should always remember in this great war of machinery thatGermany secured a tremendous advantage at the expense of France atthe outset when she occupied the most important French iron regionof Longwy-Briey.  The Germans, as I previously observed, have beenworking the French mines to the utmost--indeed, they boast thatthey have installed improved machinery in them.  They have,furthermore, been importing ore steadily from Sweden, some of theSwedish ore, such as Dannemora, being the best in the world for themanufacture of tool steel--so important in munition work.Dusseldorf, probably the most attractive large manufacturing cityin the world, had planned an industrial exhibition for 1915 or1916, and the steel skeletons of many of the buildings had alreadybeen erected at the outbreak of war.  But the Germans immediatelyset to work to tear down the steel frames to use them for morepractical purposes.  "We were going to call it a _German Fair_,"said a native manufacturer to me early in the war; "but we can haveit later and call it a _World's Fair_, as the terms will besynonymous."Isolated near the Rhine is the immense reconstructed Zeppelin shedwhich British airmen in November, 1914, partly destroyed, togetherwith the nearly completed Zeppelin within it.  The daring exploitevidently work up the newly appointed anti-aircraft gunners, forthey subsequently annihilated two of their own machines approachingfrom the West.The badly paid war slaves of Essen are working the wholetwenty-four hours, seven days a week, in three shifts a day ofeight hours each, under strict martial law.  The town is a hotbedof extreme Social Democracy, and as a rule the Socialists ofWestphalia are almost as red as those of the manufacturingdistricts of Saxony.  But Socialists though they be, they are justas anti-British as the rest of Germany, and they like to send outtheir products with the familiar hall-mark of "Gott strafeEngland," or "Best wishes for King George."  It is the kind ofSocialism that wants more money, more votes, less work, but has noobjection to plenty of war.  It is a common-sense Socialism, whichknows that without war Essen might shrink to its pre-war dimensions.Essen is very jealous of the great Skoda works near Pilsen inAustria.  My hotel manager spoke with some acerbity of the amountof advertising the Austrian siege howitzers were receiving.  "Youcan accept my assurance," he said, "that the guns for thebombardment of Dover were made here, and not at the Skoda works, asthe Austrians claim."Every German in Essen seems to feel a personal pride in theimportance of the works to the Empire at the fateful hour.  The43-centimetre gun "which conquered Belgium"--as the native putsit--is almost deified.  Everybody struts about in the consciousnessthat he or she has had directly or indirectly something to do withthe murderous weapon which has wrought such death and glory inGermany's name.  "The Empire has the men, Essen has thearmour-plate, the torpedoes, the shells, the guns.  It is thecombination which must win."  That is the spirit in Kruppville.CHAPTER XXITOMMY IN GERMANYOne day the world will be flooded with some of the most dramatic,horrible, and romantic of narratives--the life-stories of theBritish soldiers captured in the early days of the war, their grossill-treatment, their escapes, and attempts at escape.  I claim tobe the only unofficial neutral with any large amount ofeye-witness, hand-to-hand knowledge of those poor men in Germany.One of the most difficult tasks I assumed during the war was thepersonal and unconducted investigation of British prisoners of war.The visitor is only allowed to talk with prisoners when visitingcamps under the supervision of a guide.  My tramps on foot all overGermany gave me valuable information on this as on other matters.My task was facilitated by the Germany policy of showing the hatedBritish captives to as many people as possible; thus the 30,000 menhave been scattered into at least 600 prison camps.  In thedepleted state of the German Army it is not easy to find efficientguards for so many establishments.  Prisoners are constantly beingmoved about.  They are conveyed ostentatiously and shown at railwaystations en route, where until recently they were allowed to bespat upon by the public, and were given coffee into which thepublic were allowed to spit.  These are but a few of the slightsand abominations heaped upon them.  Much of it is quite unprintable.Many a night did I lie awake in Berlin cogitating how to get intotouch with some of these men.  I learned something on a previousvisit in 1914, when I saw the British prisoners at one of thecamps.  At that time it was impossible to get into conversationwith them.  They were efficiently and continually guarded bycomparatively active soldiers.On this occasion I came across my first British prisoner quite byaccident, and, as so often happens in life, difficult problemssettle themselves automatically.  In nothing that I write shall Igive any indication of the whereabouts of the sixty prisoners withwhom I conversed privately, but there can be no harm in mymentioning the whereabouts of my public visit, which took place inone of the regular neutral "Cook's tours" of the prisoners inGermany.The strain of my work in so suspicious a place as Berlin, theconstant care required to guard one's expressions, and the anxietyas to whether one was being watched or not got on my nervessometimes, and one Sunday I determined to take a day off and gointo the country with another neutral friend.  There, by accident,I came across my first private specimen of Tommy in Germany.We were looking about for a decent Gasthaus in which to getsomething to eat when we saw a notice high up in large type on awall outside an old farmhouse building, which read:--  Jeder Verkehr der Zivilbevolkerung mit den  Kriegsgefangenen ist STRENG VERBOTEN,"Any intercourse of the civil population with the prisoners of waris strictly forbidden."These notices, which threaten the civilian population with heavypenalties if they exchange any words with the prisoners, arefamiliar all over Germany, but I did not expect to find them inthat small village.My neutral friend thought it would make a nice photograph if Iwould stand under the notice, which I did after a cautious surveyshowed that the coast was clear.As I did so a Russian came out of the barn and said, in rather badGerman, "Going to have your photograph taken?"  I replied, inGerman, "Yes."He heard me speaking English to my friend, and then, looking up anddown the street each way to see if we were being watched, headdressed me in English with a strong Cockney accent."You speak English, then?" I said."I am English," he replied.  "I'm an English prisoner.""Then what are you doing in a Russian uniform?""It is the only thing I could get when my own clothes wore out."Keeping a careful eye up and down the street, he told us his story.He was one of the old Expeditionary Force; was taken at Mons withfive bullet wounds in him, and, after a series of unpublishablehumiliations, had been drafted from camp to camp until he hadarrived at this little village, where, in view of the German policyof letting all the population, see an Englishman, he was therepresentative of his race in that community.  "The local M.P." hecalled himself, in his humorous way.Robinson Crusoe on his island was not more ignorant of the truthabout the great world than that man, for, while he had learnt a fewdaily expressions in German, he was unable to read it.  The onlyinformation he could gather was from the French, Belgian, andRussian prisoners with him, and some he got by bribing one of theLandsturm Guards with a little margarine or sugar out of his parcelfrom England.  He was full of the battle of Mons and how badly heand his comrades in Germany felt at the way they had been leftunsupported there.  None the less, though alone, with no Englishmanfor miles, living almost entirely on his parcels, absolutely cutoff from the real facts of the war, hearing little but lies, he wasas calmly confident of the ultimate victory of the Allies as I am.I asked him if he heard from home."Yes," he said, "now and then, but the folks tell me nothing and Ican tell them nothing.  If you get back to England you tell thepeople there not to believe a word that comes from Englishprisoners.  Those who write favourably do so because they have to.Every truthful letter is burned by the military censor.  Tell thepeople to arrange the parcels better and see that every man gets aparcel at least once a week--not send five parcels to one man andno parcels to some poor bloke like me who is alone.  How is the wargoing on, guv'nor?" he asked.  I gave him my views.  "I think it'sgoing badly for the Germans--not by what they tell me here or whatI gets in that awful _Continental Times_ paper, but from what Inotice in the people round about, and the officers who visit us.The people are not so abusive to the English as they used to be.The superior officers do not treat us like dogs, as they did, andas for the Landsturmers--well, look at old Heinrich here."At that moment a heavy, shabby old Landsturm soldier came round thecorner, and the Cockney prisoner treated him almost as though hewere a performing bear."You're all right, ain't you, Heiny, so long as I give you a bit ofsugar now and then?" he said to his decrepit old guardian in hisGerman gibberish.This state of affairs was a revelation to me, but I was soon tofind that if the British prisoners are weary of their captivitytheir old German guardians are much more weary of their task.These high-spirited British lads, whom two years of cruelty havenot cowed, are an intense puzzle to the German authorities."You see," remarked a very decent German official connected withthe military censorship department, "everyone of these Britishersis different.  Every one of them sticks up for what he calls his'rights': many of them decline to work on Sunday, and short oftaking them out on Sunday morning at the point of the bayonet wecannot get them to do it.  We have to be careful, too, with theseEnglishmen now.  As a man of the world, you will realise thatthough our general public here do not know that the English havecaptured many Germans lately, and the fact is never mentioned inthe _communiques_, we have had a hint from Headquarters that theBritish prisoners may one day balance ours, and that hardship forthese _verfluchte Englander_ may result in hardship for our men inEngland."That incident was long ago.  It is important to relate that sincethe beginning of the battle of the Somme there is, if I wascorrectly informed, a marked improvement in the condition ofEnglish prisoners all over Germany--not as regards food supplied bythe authorities, because the food squeeze naturally affects theprisoners as it does their guardians, but in other ways.In addition to the British capturing numbers of German hostages onthe Somme to hold against the treatment of their men in Germany, Ithink I may claim without undue pride that much good work has beendone by the American Ambassador and his staff of attaches, who workas sedulously on behalf of the prisoners as though those prisonershad been American.The German authorities hate and respect publicity and force inmatters not to their liking, and Mr. Gerard's fearlessness inreports of conditions and urgent pleas for improvement have been ofgreat service.  All the threats and bluster of Germany have failedto cow him.To continue my narrative of the Cockney soldier in Russian uniform.So many Englishmen are in Russian uniform, Belgian uniform, Frenchuniform, or a mix-up uniform that there is no possibility of myCockney Russian being recognised by the authorities, and thephotograph which my neutral friend took of him and me was takenunder the very eyes of his Landsturmer."Heiny," said the Russian Cockney, "is fed up with the war.  Aren'tyou, old Heiny?  During the last few weeks a fresh call for moremen has cleared the district of everything on two legs.  We havehad to work fourteen hours a day, and I wonder what my mates athome would think of 3 shillings pay for ten days' work?"I was able to comfort him by giving him some cigars, and a greatdeal of really true and good news about the war, all of which herepeated to Landsturmer Heinrich.  I suggested that this might beunwise.  "Not a bit of it," he said.  "Lots of these old Germansare only too anxious to hear bad news, because they think that badnews will bring the thing to a stop."How true that remark was I knew from my minute investigations.  Theincident was closed by the distant appearence of a _Feldwebel_(sergeant-major).  My Cockney vanished, and Heinrich patrolledonward.This particular incident is not typical of the life of a Britishprisoner in Germany, but it is indicative of the position many ofthe 30,000 prisoners have taken up by reason of their strongindividuality and extraordinary cheerfulness and confidence.  Myimpression of them is of alert, resourceful men (their escapes havebeen wonderful)--men who never know when they are beaten.  IfBritain has sufficient of these people she cannot possibly lose thewar.      *      *      *      *      *The world does not need reminders such as that of Wittenberg or ofsuch singularly accurate narratives as several in _Blackwood'sMagazine_ to know what _has_ happened to British prisoners inGermany.It is common knowledge throughout the German Empire that the mostloathsome tasks of the war in connection, with every camp or cageare given to the British.  They have had to clean the latrines ofnegro prisoners, and were in some cases forced to work withimplements which would make their task the more disgusting.  Oneman told me that his lunch was served to him where he was working,and when he protested he was told to eat it there, or go without.Conversations that I have had here in London about prisoners giveme the impression that the British public does not exactlyapprehend what a prisoner stands for in German eyes.First, he is a hostage.  If he be an officer his exact social valueis estimated by the authorities in Berlin, who have a complete cardindex of all their officer prisoners, showing to what Britishfamilies they belong and whether they have social or politicalconnections in Britain.  Thus when someone in England mistakenly,and before sufficient German prisoners were in their hands, treatedcertain submarine marauders differently from other prisoners, theGerman Government speedily referred to this card-index, picked outa number of officers with connections in the House of Lords andHouse of Commons, and treated them as convicts.The other German view of the prisoner is his cash value as alabourer.  I invite my readers to realise the enormous pecuniaryworth of the two million prisoner slaves now reclaiming swamps,tilling the soil, building roads and railways, and working infactories for their German taskmasters.The most numerous body of prisoners in Germany are the Russians.They are to be seen everywhere.  In some cases they have greaterfreedom than any other prisoners, and often, in isolated cases,travel unguarded by rail or tramway to and from their work.  Ifthey are not provided with good Russian uniforms, in which, ofcourse, they would not be able to escape, they are made conspicuousby a wide stripe down the trouser or on the back.  They are easy,docile, physically strong, and accustomed to a lower grade of foodthan any other prisoners, except the Serbs.The British, of course, are much the smallest number in Germany,but much the most highly prized for hate propaganda purposes."More difficult to manage," said one _Unteroffizier_ to me, "thanthe whole of the rest of our two million."  It is, indeed, a factthat the 30,000 British prisoners, though the worst treated, arethe gayest, most outspoken, and rebellious against tyranny of thewhole collection.There is, however, a brighter side to prison life in Germany, I amhappy to record.  A number of really excellent camps have beenarranged to which neutral visitors are taken.  When I told theGerman Foreign Office that I would like to see the good side ofprison life, I was given permission by the _Kriegsministerium_ (WarOffice) to visit the great camp at Soltau, with its 31,000 inmateswith Halil Halid Bey (formerly Turkish Consul in Berlin) and HerrMuller (interested in Germany's Far Eastern developments).Five hours away from Berlin, on the monotonous _Luneberger Heide_(Luneberg Heath), has sprung up this great town with the speed of aboom mining town in Colorado.On arrival at the little old town of Soltau we were met by amilitary automobile and driven out on a road made by the prisonersto the largest collection of huts I have ever seen.There is nothing wrong that I could detect in the camp, and Ishould say that the 300 British prisoners there are as well treatedas any in Germany.  The Commandant seems to be a good fellow.  Histask of ruling so great an assemblage of men is a large anddifficult one, rendered the easier by the good spirit engendered byhis tact and kindness.I had confirmation of my own views of him later, when I came acrossa Belgian who had escaped from Germany, and who had been in thiscamp.  He said:--"The little captain at Soltau was a good fellow,and if I am with the force that releases the prisoners there afterwe get into Germany, I will do my best to see that he gets extragood treatment."Our inspection occupied six hours.  Halil Halid Bey, who talksEnglish perfectly, and looks like an Irishman, was taken for anAmerican by the prisoners.  In fact, one Belgian, believing him tobe an American official, rushed up to him and with armsoutstretched pleaded: "Do you save poor Belgians, too, as well asBritish?"The physical comfort of the prisoners is well looked after in theneat and perfectly clean dormitories.  The men were packed ratherclosely, I thought, but not more than on board ship.One became almost dazed in passing through these miles of huts,arranged in blocks like the streets of an American town.We visited the hospital, which was as good as many civilianhospitals in other countries.  There I heard the first complaint,from a little red-headed Irishman, his voice wheezing with asthma,whose grievance was not against the camp itself, but against amedical order which had reversed, what he called his promise to besent to Switzerland.  He raised his voice without any fear, as ourlittle group, accompanied by the Commandant and the interpreter,went round, and I was allowed to speak to him freely.  I am not amedical man, but I should think his was a case for release.  Hislungs were obviously in a bad state.We were also accompanied by an English sergeant, one Saxton--amagnificent type of the old Army, so many of whom are eating outtheir days in Germany.  He spoke freely and frankly about thearrangements, and had no complaint to make except the food shortageand the quality of the food.The British section reminded one now and then of England.Portraits of wives, children, and sweethearts were over the beds;there was no lack of footballs, and the British and Belgians playfootball practically every day after the daily work of reclaimingthe land, erecting new huts, making new roads, and looking afterthe farms and market gardens has been accomplished.An attempt has been made to raise certain kinds of live stock, suchas pigs, poultry, and Belgian hares--a large kind of rabbit.  Therewere a few pet dogs about--one had been trained by a Belgian toperform tricks equal to any of those displayed at variety theatres.Apparently there is no lack of amusement.  I visited thecinematograph theatre, and the operator asked, "What would you liketo see--something funny?"  He showed us a rather familiar old film.The reels are those that have been passed out of service of theGerman moving picture shows.  In the large theatre, which wouldhold, I should think, seven hundred to a thousand people, there wasa good acrobatic act and the performing dog, to which I havereferred, with an orchestra of twenty-five instruments, almost allprisoners, but a couple of German Landsturmers helped out.  Theguarding of the prisoners is effected by plenty of barbed wire anda comparatively small number of oldish Landsturmers.A special cruelty of the Germans towards prisoners is the provisionof a lying newspaper in French for the Frenchmen, called the_Gazette des Ardennes_.  The _Gazette des Ardennes_ publishes everyimaginable kind of lie about the French and French Army, withgarbled quotations from English newspapers, and particularly _TheTimes_, calculated to disturb the relations of the French andEnglish prisoners in Germany.  For the British there is a paper inEnglish which is quite as bad, to which I have already referred,called the _Continental Times_, doled out three times a week.   The_Continental Times_ is, I regret to say, largely written byrenegade Englishmen in Berlin employed by the German Government,notably Aubrey Stanhope, who for well-known reasons was unable toenter England at the outbreak of war, and so remains and mustremain in Germany, where, for a very humble pittance, he conductsthis campaign against his own country.For the Russians a special prevaricating sheet, called the _RusskiVisnik_, is issued.  All these newspapers pretend to print theofficial French, British, and Russian communiques.For a long time the effect on the British prisoners was bad, butlittle by little events revealed to them that the _ContinentalTimes_, which makes a specialty of attacks on the English Press,was anti-British.The arrival of letters and parcels is, of course, the great eventfor the prisoners and, so far as the large camps are concerned, Ido not think that there are now any British prisoners unprovidedwith parcels.  It is the isolated and scattered men, moved oftenfrom place to place for exhibition purposes, who miss parcels.Soltau, although a model camp, is bleak and dreary and isolated.At the outset cases of typhus occurred there, and in a neat,secluded corner of the camp long lines of wooden crosses tell thetale of sadness.  The first cross marked a Russian from far-awayVilna, the next a Tommy from London.  East had met West in thebleak and silent graveyard on the heather.  Close to them slept asoldier from some obscure village in Normandy, and beside him lay aBelgian, whose life had been the penalty of his country'sdetermination to defend her neutrality.  Here in the heart ofGermany the Allies were united even in death.As I made the long journey back to Berlin I reflected with somecontent on the good things I had seen at Soltau, and I feltconvinced that the men in charge of the camp do everything withintheir power to make the life of the prisoners happy.  But as thetrain pounded along in the darkness I seemed to see a face beforeme which I could not banish.  It was the face of a Belgian,kneeling at the altar in the Catholic chapel, his eyes riveted onhis Saviour on the Cross, his whole being tense in ferventsupplication, his lips quivering in prayer.  My companions hadgone, but I was held spellbound, feeling "How long! How long!" wasthe anguish of his mind.  He must have been a man who had a homeand loved it, and his whole expression told unmistakably that hewas imploring for strength to hold out till the end in that dreary,cheerless region of brown and grey.His captors had given him a chapel, to be sure, but why was he inGermany at all?      *      *      *      *      *Soltau and other camps are satisfactory--but there are others, manyothers, such as unvisited punishment camps.  The average Britisherin confinement in Germany is under the care of an oldish guard,such as Heiny of the Landsturm, but the immediate authority isoften a man of the notorious _Unteroffizier_ type, whose cruelty tothe _German_ private is well known, and whose treatment of the mosthated enemy can be imagined.The petty forms of tyranny meted out to German soldiers such asmaking a man walk for hours up and down stairs in order to fill abath with a wineglass; making him shine and soil then again shineand soil hour after hour a pair of boots; making him chew andswallow his own socks have been described in suppressed Germanbooks.I believe that publicity, rigorous blockade and big shells are theonly arguments that have any effect on the Prussians at present.It is publicity and the fear of opinion of certain neutrals thathas produced such camps as Soltau.  It is difficult for thecomfortable sit-at-homes to visualise the condition of men who havebeen in the enemy atmosphere of hate for a long period.  All theBritish soldiers whom I met in Germany were captured in the earlypart of the war when their shell-less Army had to face machine-gunsand high explosives often with the shield of their own breasts anda rifle.Herded like cattle many of the wounded dying, they travelledeastwards to be subject to the insults and vilifications of theGerman population.  That they should retain their cheery confidencein surroundings and among a people so ferociously hostile soentirely un-British, so devoid of chivalry or sporting instinct, isa monument to the character of their race.CHAPTER XXIIHOW THE PRUSSIAN GUARD CAME HOME FROM THE SOMMEEarly in August, 1916, I was in Berlin.  The British and Frenchoffensive had commenced on July 1st.  Outwardly it appeared toattract very little notice on the part of Germany and I do notbelieve that it attracted sufficient attention even in the highestmilitary quarters.  It was considered to be Great Britain's final"bluff."  The great maps in the shop windows in every street and onthe walls in every German house showed no change, and still show nochange worth noticing.  "Maps speak," say the Germans.One hot evening in Berlin I met a young officer whom I had known ona previous visit to Germany, and who was home on ten days'furlough.  I noticed that he was ill or out of sorts, and he toldme that he had been unexpectedly called back to his regiment on theWestern front.  "How is that?" I said.  He made that curious andindescribable German gesture which shows discontent anddissatisfaction.  "These ------ English are putting every man theyhave got into a final and ridiculous attempt to make us listen topeace terms.  My leave is cut short, and I am off this evening."We had a glass of beer at the Bavaria Restaurant in theFriedrichstrasse."You have been in England, haven't you?" he inquired.  I told himthat I had been there last year.  "They seem to have more soldiersthan we thought," he said.  "They seem to be learning the business;my battalion has suffered terribly."Within the next day or two there were other rumours inBerlin--rumours quite unknown to the mass.  How and where I heardthese rumours it would be unfair to certain Germans, who wereextremely kind to me, to say, but it was suggested to me by afriend--a member of the Extreme Left of the Social DemocraticParty--that if I wanted to learn the truth I should go out toPotsdam and see the arrival of the wounded men of the famousPrussian Guard, who had, he said, had a terrible experience at thehands of the English at Contalmaison on July 10th.He drew me aside in the Tiergarten and told me, for he is, I amsure, a real German patriot, that the state of things in the Somme,if known throughout Germany, would effectively destroy thepretensions of the annexationist party, who believed that Germanyhas won the war and will hold Belgium and the conquered portion ofFrance and Poland.He told me to go out to Potsdam with caution, and he warned me thatI should have the utmost difficulty in getting anywhere near themilitary sidings of the railway station there.I asked another usually extremely well-informed friend if there wasanything particular happening in the war, and told him that Ithought of going to Potsdam, and he said, "What for?  There isnothing to be seen there--the same old drilling, drilling,drilling." So well are secrets kept in Germany.The 4th of August is the anniversary of what is known in Germany as"England's treachery"--the day that Britain entered the war in whatthe German Government tells the people is "a base and cowardlyattempt to try and beat her by starving innocent women andchildren."On that sunny and fresh morning I looked out of the railwaycarriage window some quarter of a mile before we arrived at Potsdamand saw numerous brown trains marked with the Ked Cross, trainsthat usually travel by night in Germany.There were a couple of officers of the Guard Cavalry in the samecarriage with me.  They also looked out.  "_Ach, noch 'mal_"("What, again?") discontentedly remarked the elder.  They were agloomy pair and they had reason to be.  The German public has begunto know a great deal about the wounded.  They do not yet know allthe facts, because wounded men are, as far as possible, hidden inGermany and never sent to Socialist centres unless it is absolutelyunavoidable.  The official figures which are increasing in anenormous ratio since the development of Britain's war machine, arefalsified by manipulation.And if easy proof be needed of the truth of my assertion I point tothe monstrous official misstatement involved in the announcementthat over ninety per cent. of German wounded return to the firingline!  Of the great crush of wounded at Potsdam I doubt whether anyappreciable portion of the serious cases will return to anythingexcept permanent invalidism.  They are suffering from shell wounds,not shrapnel, for the most part, I gathered.As our train emptied it was obvious that some great spectacle wasin progress.  The exit to the station became blocked with staringpeasant women returning from the early market in Berlin, their highfruit and vegetable baskets empty on their backs.  When Ieventually got through the crowd into the outer air and paused atthe top of the short flight of steps I beheld a scene that willnever pass from my memory.  Filmed and circulated in Germany itwould evoke inconceivable astonishment to this deluded nation andwould swell the malcontents, already a formidable mass, into aunited and dangerous army of angry, eye-opened dupes.  This is notthe mere expression of a neutral view, but is also the opinion of asober and patriotic German statesman.I saw the British wounded arrive from Neuve Chapelle at Boulogne; Isaw the Russian wounded in the retreat from the Bukovina; I saw theBelgian wounded in the Antwerp retreat, and the German wounded inEast Prussia, but the wounded of the Prussian Guard at Potsdamsurpassed in sadness anything I have witnessed in the last twobloody years.The British Neuve Chapelle wounded were, if not gay, many of themblithe and smiling--their bodies were hurt but their minds werecheerful; but the wounded of the Prussian Guard--the proudestmilitary force in the world--who had come back to their home towndecimated and humbled--these Guards formed the most amazingagglomeration of broken men I have ever encountered.  As to thenumbers of them, of these five Reserve regiments but few arebelieved to be unhurt.  Vast numbers were killed, and most of therest are back at Potsdam in the ever growing streets of hospitalsthat are being built on the Bornstadterfeld.One of the trains had just stopped.  The square was blocked withvehicles of every description.  I was surprised to find the greatGerman furniture vans, which by comparison with those used inEngland and the United States look almost like houses on wheels,were drawn up in rows with military precision.  As if these werenot enough, the whole of the wheeled traffic of Potsdam seemed tobe commandeered by the military for the lightly wounded--cabs,tradesmen's wagons, private carriages--everything on wheels except,of course, motor-cars, which are non-existent owing to the rubbershortage.  Endless tiers of stretchers lay along the low embankmentsloping up to the line.  Doctors, nurses, and bearers were waitingin quiet readiness.The passengers coming out of the station, including the women withthe tall baskets, stopped, but only for a moment.  They did nottarry, for the police, of which there will never be any dearth ifthe war lasts thirty years, motioned them on, a slight movement ofthe hand being sufficient.I was so absorbed that I failed to notice the big constable near meuntil he laid his heavy paw upon my shoulder and told me to moveon.  A schoolmaster and his wife, his _Rucksack_ full of lunch, whohad taken advantage of the glorious sunshine to get away fromBerlin to spend a day amidst the woods along the Havel, asked thepoliceman what the matter was.The reply was "_Nichts hier zu sehen_" ("Nothing to be seen here.Get along!").  The great "Hush! Hush!  Hush!" machinery of Germanywas at work.Determined not to be baffled, I moved out of the square into theshelter of a roadside tree, on the principle that a distant viewwould be better than none at all, but the police were on the alert,and a police lieutenant tackled me at once.  I decided to act onthe German military theory that attack is the best defence, and,stepping up to him, I stated, that I was a newspaper correspondent."Might I not see the wounded taken from the train?" I requested.He very courteously replied that I might not, unless I had aspecial pass for that purpose from the _Kriegsministerium_ inBerlin.I hit upon a plan.I regretfully sighed that I would go back to Berlin and get a pass,and retracing my steps to the station I bought a ticket.A soldier and an Unteroffizier were stationed near the box in whichstood the uniformed woman who punches tickets.The Unteroffizier looked at me sharply, "No train for an hour and ahalf," he said."That doesn't disturb me in the least when I have plenty to read,"I answered pleasantly, at the same time pointing to the bundle ofmorning papers which I carried, the _Norddeutsche AllgemeineZeitung_ of the Foreign Office, on the outside.I knew Potsdam thoroughly, and was perfectly familiar with everyfoot of the station.  I knew that there was a large window in thefirst and second-class dining-room which was even closer to theambulances in the square than were the exit steps.I did not go directly to the dining-room, but sat on one of thehigh-backed benches on the platform and began to read the papers.The Unteroffizier looked out and found me fairly buried in them.He returned a little later and saw me asleep--or thought he did.When he had gone I sauntered along the platform into thedining-room, to find it vacant save for a youthful waiter and abarmaid.  I walked straight to the window--where the light would bebetter for reading--and ordered bread and Edam cheese, tearing offa fifty gram amount from my Berlin bread ticket, which wasfortunately good in Potsdam.My position enabled me to look right out upon the square below, butrendered me inconspicuous from the street.By this time the wounded were being moved from the train.  Theslightly wounded were drawn up in double ranks, their clean whitearm- and head-bandages gleaming in the noonday light.  They stooddazed and dejected, looking on at the real work which was justbeginning--the removal of the severely wounded.Then it was that I learned the use of those mammoth furniture vans.Then it was I realised that these vans are part of Germany's plansby which her wounded are carried--I will not say secretly, but asunobtrusively as possible.  In some of the mammoths were puttwelve, into others fourteen; others held as many as twenty.The Prussian Guard had come home.  The steel corps of the army ofGermany had met near Contalmaison the light-hearted boys I had seendrilling in Hyde Park last year, and in a furious counter-attack,in which they had attempted to regain the village, had been wipedout.These were not merely wounded, but dejected wounded.  The wholeatmosphere of the scene was that of intense surprise anddepression.  Tradition going back to Frederick the Great, nearlytwo hundred years ago, had been smashed--by amateur soldiers.  Thecallow youth of sixteen who served my lunch was muttering somethingto the barmaid, who replied that he was lucky to be in a class thatwas not likely to be called up yet.The extreme cases were carried at a snail's pace by bearers, whoput their feet down as carefully as if they were testing very thinice, and who placed the comfortable spring stretchers in the veryfew vehicles which had rubber or imitation rubber tyres.  The workwas done with military precision and great celerity.  Theevacuation of this train was no sooner finished than another tookits place, and the same scene was repeated.  Presently the greatfurniture vans returned from having deposited their terrible loads,and were again filled.  One van was reserved for those who hadexpired on the journey, and it was full.This, then, was the battered remnant of the five Reserve regimentsof the Prussian Guard which had charged the British lines atContalmaison three weeks before in a desperate Germancounter-attack to wrest the village from the enemy, who had justoccupied it.  Each train discharged between six and seven hundredmaimed passengers.  Nor was this the last day of the influx.The Guard had its garrisons chiefly in Potsdam, but also partly inBerlin, and represents the physical flower of German manhood.  Onparade it was inspiring to look at, and no military officer in theworld ever doubted its prowess.  Nor has it failed in the war toshow splendid courage and fighting qualities.  English peoplesimply do not understand its prestige at home and among neutrals.The Guard is sent only where there is supreme work to be done.  Ifyou hear that it has been hurled into a charge you may rest assuredthat it is striving to gain something on which Germany sets thehighest price--for the life-blood of the Guard is the dearest thatshe can pay.In the battle of the Marne the active regiments of the Guardforming a link between the armies of von Bulow and von Hausen weredashed like spray on jagged cliffs when they surged in wave afterwave against the army of Foch at Sezanne and Fere Champenoise.Germany was willing to sacrifice those superb troops during theearly part of the battle because she knew that von Kluck had onlyto hold his army together, even though he did not advance, and theoverthrow of Foch would mean a Teuton wedge driven between Verdunand Paris.One year and ten months later she hurled the Guard Reserve atContalmaison because she was determined that this important link inthe chain of concrete and steel that coiled back and forth beforeBapaume-Peronne must remain unbroken.  The newly-formed lines ofBritain's sons bent but did not break under the shock.  They wereoutnumbered, but, like all the rest of the British that theback-from-the-front German soldiers have told me about, thesefought on and on, never thinking of surrender.I know from one of these that in a first onslaught the Guard lostheavily, but was reinforced and again advanced.  Another desperateencounter and the men from Potsdam withered in the hand-to-handcarnage.  The Germans could not hold what they had won back, andthe khaki succeeded the field grey at Contalmaison.The evacuation of the wounded occupied hours.  I purposely missedmy train, for I knew that I was probably the only foreign civilianto see the historic picture of the proudest soldiery of Prussiareturn to its garrison town from the greatest battle in history.Empty trains were pulled out of the way, to be succeeded by moretrains full of wounded, and again more.  Doctors and nurses wereattentive and always busy, and the stretcher-bearers moved back andforth until their faces grew red with exertion.But it was the visages of the men on the stretchers that riveted myattention.  I never saw so many men so completely exhausted.  Notone pair of lips relaxed into a smile, and not an eye lit up withthe glad recognition of former surroundings.It was not, however, the lines of suffering in those faces thatimpressed me, but that uncanny sameness of expression, anexpression of hopeless gloom so deep that it made me forget thatthe sun was shining from an unclouded sky.  The dejection of thepolice, of the soldier onlookers, of the walking wounded, and thoseupturned faces on the white pillows told as plainly as words couldever tell that the Guard had at last met a force superior tothemselves and their war machine.  They knew well that they werethe idol of their Fatherland, and that they had fought with everyounce of their great physical strength, backed by their longtraditions.  They had been vanquished by an army of mere sportsmen.My thoughts went back to Berlin and the uninformed scoffings at theBritish Army and its futile efforts to push back the troops ofRupprecht on the Somme.  Yet here on the actual outskirts of theGerman capital was a grim tribute to the machine that Great Britainhad built up under the protection of her Navy.In Berlin at that moment the afternoon editions were flutteringtheir daily headlines of victory to the crowds on the Linden andthe Friedrichstrasse, but here the mammoth vans were moving slowlythrough the streets of Potsdam.To the women who stood in the long lines waiting with the potatoand butter tickets for food on the other side of the old stonebridge that spans the Havel they were merely ordinary cumbersomefurniture wagons.How were they to know that these tumbrils contained the bloodystory of Contalmaison?CHAPTER XXIIIHOW GERMANY DENIESGermany, according to Reichstag statements, is spending millions ofpounds upon German propaganda throughout the universe.  The trendof that propaganda is:--1. To attempt to convince the neutral world that Germany cannot bebeaten; and2. Above all, to convince Great Britain (the chief enemy) thatGermany cannot be beaten.The only factors really feared by the Germans of the governingclass are the Western front and the blockade.I went into Germany determined to try to find out the truth, and totell the truth.  I had an added incentive to be thorough and workon original lines, since I was fortunate enough to securepossession of an official letter which advised those whom itconcerned to give no information of value to Americans in general.I also got accurate information that the Wilhelmstrasse had singledme out as one American in particular to whom nothing of value wasto be imparted.The German, with his cast-in-a-mould mind, does not understand thetrait developed among other peoples of seeing things forthemselves.  He is unacquainted with originality in human beings.He thinks a correspondent does not observe anything unless it ispointed out to him.Last summer, for example, one could learn in the Wilhelmstrassethat the potato crop was a glittering success.  By walking throughthe country and pulling up an occasional plant, also talking to thefarmers, I concluded that it was a dismal failure, which conclusionI announced in one of the first newspaper articles I wrote after Ihad left Germany.  Recent reports from that country show that I wasright, which increases my conviction that the _confidential tips_given by Germany's professional experts, who instruct neutralvisitors, do very well to make Germany's position seem better thanit actually is, but they seldom stand the acid test of history.Seeking to invent excuses is not peculiar to the Germans, but it ismore prevalent among them than among any other people that I know.In this one respect the German Government is a Government of thepeople.  Some of the diplomatic explanations which have emanatedfrom Berlin during the war have been weird in their absurdity andan insult to the intelligence of those to whom they were addressed.President Wilson did not accept the official lie concerning thesinking of the _Arabic_, in view of the positive proof againstGermany, and Germany backed down.  President Wilson did not acceptthe official lie concerning the sinking of the _Sussex_.Incomprehensible as it is to the Teutonic mind, he attached greaterweight to the first-hand evidence of reliable eye-witnesses, plusfragments of the torpedo which struck the vessel, than to thesacred words of the German Foreign Office, which had theimpertinence to base its case on a sketch, or alleged sketch,hastily made by a U-boat manipulator whose artistic temperamentshould have led him to Munich rather than to Kiel.  The crime andthe lie were so glaring that Germany once more backed down.Germany lied about the Dutch liner _Tubantia_.  As in the case ofthe _Sussex_, the evidence of the fragments of torpedo was soincontrovertible that Berlin had to admit that a German torpedosank the _Tubantia_.  Indeed, one fragment contained the number ofthe torpedo.  During my travels in the Fatherland at that time Ifound no doubt in the minds of those with whom I discussed thematter that a German submarine sank the vessel, though many were ofthe opinion that it was a mistake.The Wilhelmstrasse is tenacious, however, and we awoke one morningto read, what was probably its most remarkable excuse.  To be sure,a German torpedo sank the _Tubantia_, but it was not fired by theGermans.  The expert accountant who was in charge of the U-boatlearned upon consulting his books that he fired that torpedo onMarch 6.  It did not strike the _Tubantia_ until March 16.  So thatit had either been floating about aimlessly and had encountered theliner, or perhaps the cunning British had corraled it and made useof it.  At any rate, Berlin disclaimed all responsibility for itsacts subsequent to the day it parted company with the Germansubmarine.The path of the torpedo, however, had been observed from the bridgeof the Tubantia.I remarked to one of my well-informed confidants among the SocialDemocratic politicians that although it is perfectly true that arolling stone gathers no moss, it is equally true that a movingtorpedo leaves no wake."Yes," he said with a twinkle in his eye, "our Foreign Office iswell aware of that.  Have you not noticed the significance of thetwo dates, March 6, when the torpedo is said to have been fired,and March 16, when it struck?  Do you not see that our diplomatshave still one more loop-hole in case they are pressed?  Is it notclear that they could find a way out of their absurd explanation byshifting the responsibility to the man or the men who jotted downthe date and transferred it?  The question in my mind is: Who lostthe 1 from the 16?"Be that as it may, little Holland, enraged at the wantondestruction of one of her largest vessels, was not in a position toenforce her demands.  Therefore Germany did not back down--that is,not publicly.My description of the return of the Prussian Guard to Potsdamnaturally aroused the wrath of a Government which strivesincessantly, to hide so much from its own people and the outsideworld.Directly the article reached Germany the Government flashed awireless to America that no members of the _Potsdam_ Guard returnedto Potsdam from Contalmaison.  This is a typical German denialtrick.  I never mentioned the _Potsdam_ Guard.I had referred to the _Prussian_ Guard.If any reader of this chapter cares to look into the files ofEnglish newspapers at the time of the Contalmaison battle, for suchit was, they will find confirmation of my statements as to thepresence of the Prussian Guard in the English despatches publishedin the second week in July.The Contalmaison article has in whole or in part been circulated inthe United States, and also in the South-American Republics, andprobably in other neutral countries.  This has now called forth asemi-official detailed denial, which I print herewith.It is signed by the Head Staff Doctor at Potsdam, one Geronne, byname.  He divides his contradiction into ten clauses.  Each of thefirst nine contains an absolute untruth.The last is a mere comment on a well-known, German statesman, whotold me that as I was seeking the truth in Germany I had better goand find it at Potsdam.I wish to deal with the denials one by one, as each is a revelationof German psychology.  1. The hospital train,           This says "Hospital  which reached Potsdam on         train" (singular).  I  August 4, and was there          described hospital trains  unloaded, brought wounded        (plural).  It may be true  men from various troop           that one train did not  divisions.  There were no        contain any Prussian Guards.  Prussian Guards among them.      I did not happen to see                                   that train.  All the trains                                   that I saw unloaded Prussian                                   Guard Reserves.  2. No wounded man is             I have never said that  kept concealed in Germany.       any wounded man was  All are consigned to             kept concealed in Germany.  public hospitals or              I have pointed out  lazarets, where they may         that the whole system of  at any time be visited           the German placing of the  by their relatives and           wounded is to hide from  friends.                         the German population,                                   and especially in Social                                   Democrat districts, the                                   extent of their wounded.  3. Hospital trains travel        This is absolutely untrue.  by day as well as by night,      The number of wounded arriving  and, in accordance with          at the depots in Germany is  instructions, are unloaded       now so great that the trains  only in the daytime.  In         are obliged to be unloaded  case they reach their            whenever they arrive, by day  destination during the           or by night.  I have witnessed  night, the regulations           both.  provide that they are to  wait until the following  morning before unloading.  4. In order that the loading     The whole of this paragraph  or unloading of the vehicles     is a transparent distortion  which transport the wounded      of fact.  What happens at  to the lazarets may proceed      Potsdam and what happens  as rapidly as possible, it       everywhere else is that a  is necessary to keep the         cordon of police surrounds  surroundings of the train        the scene and, drives the  clear.  The wounded must         public by force in the usual  also be spared all annoyance     Prussian way, if necessary,  and curiosity on the part        from the scene.  I described  of the public.                   the method by which I                                   witnessed what was going on                                   at the railway station from                                   the railway station                                   refreshment room itself.  5. Dead men have never been      I saw the dead men removed.  unloaded from the lazaret  trains at Potsdam--therefore  there could have been none on  August 4, 1916.  The  principle of transporting  the wounded is based upon  the ability of the wounded  to bear transportation.  All those who suffer during  the journey are removed  to a hospital at the frontier.  6. The furniture vans            A transparent untruth  used for transporting            on the face of it.  If only  wounded to the hospitals         one train came into Potsdam  at Potsdam and other             why use furniture vans at  cities have proved a great       all?  The furniture vans  success.  These vans,            are used for purposes of  moreover, all bear the sign      concealment, and because  of the Red Cross, and may        the very large ambulance  easily be recognised as          supply always on duty at  hospital vehicles.               the great military                                   hospitals at Potsdam was                                   unequal to the task.  I saw                                   no Red Cross indications.  7. That men who are              My statement is that all  seriously wounded should         the German wounded at  give one an impression of        the present stage of the  weariness goes without           war, lightly or otherwise,  saying.  Lightly wounded         compare badly with the  men who travel from the          English and French  Somme to Boulogne may            wounded, whom I have  make a better appearance         seen.  They are utterly  than the seriously wounded       war weary and suffering  who have made the long           not so much from shell  journey from the West            shock as from surprise  front to Potsdam.                shock, the revelation of the                                   creation of a British                                   Army that had never                                   occurred to the German                                   soldiers.  8. As to the great "Hush!

First, the number of men of military age; second, thenumber of these that are indispensable in civil life; third, thenumber of casualties.  Concerning the last two there are greatdifferences of opinion among military critics in Allied and neutralcountries.  As regards the first there need be little difference,although I confess surprise at the number of people I have met whobelieve the grotesque myth that Germany has systematicallyconcealed her increase in population, and that instead of being anation of less than seventy millions she has really more than onehundred millions.It is safe to say that at the outbreak of war Germany was a nationof 68,000,000, of whom 33,500,000 were males.  Of these nearly14,000,000 were between 18 and 45; 350,000 men over 45 are alsowith the Colours.  The boys who were then 16 and 17 can now beadded, giving us a grand total of some 15,000,000.Normally Germany employed men of between 18 and 45 asfollows:--Mines, 600,000; metals, 800,000; transport, 650,000;agriculture, 3,000,000; clothing, food preparation, 1,000,000,making a total of 6,050,000.Up to this point there can be little difference of opinion.  Fromthis point on, however, I must, like others who deal with thesubject, make estimates upon data obtained.  During my last visitto Germany I systematically employed a rough check on the figuresderived through the usual channels.  Concentrated effort to obtainfirst-hand information in city, village, and countryside, north,east, south, and west, with eyes and ears open, and vocal organsconstantly used for purposes of interrogation, naturally yieldedconsiderable data when carried over a period of ten months.  Thechanges from my last visit and from peace time were also dulyobserved as were the differences between Germany and the othernations I had visited during the war.  Walking, of which I did acolossal amount, was most instructive, because it afforded me anopportunity to study conditions in the villages.  Discreetquestioning gave me accurate statistics in hundreds of these that Ivisited, and of many more hundreds that I asked about from peoplewhom I met on my travels.  For example, in Oberammergau, which hadat the beginning of the war 1,900 inhabitants, about 350 had beencalled to the Colours when I was there, and of these thirty-ninehad been killed.My investigations in the Fatherland convinced me that of the3,000,000 men between 18 and 45 formerly engaged in agriculture,considerably fewer than 100,000 continue to be thus occupied.  Thiswork is done by prisoners and women.  Mine and metal work have keptfrom 60 to 70 per cent. of their men of military age; buttransport, already cut somewhat, lost 25 per cent. of the remainderwhen Hindenburg assumed supreme command, which would reduce 650,000to about 300,000.  More than 90 per cent. of those engaged in thepreparation of food and the making of clothing have been called up.Thus of the 6,050,000 engaged in the occupations given above, about1,750,000 remain, which means that more than 4,000,000 have beencalled to the Colours.From building and allied trades at least 90 per cent. are inmilitary uniform.  Assuming that some 2,000,000 men of military ageare included in indispensable engineers, fishermen, chemists,physically unfit, and so forth, we conclude on this basis thatGermany can enrol in her Army and Navy more than 11,000,000 men.We may approach the subject from a somewhat different angle byconsidering what percentage of her total population Germany couldcall to the Colours under stress--and she is to-day under stress.Savage tribes have been known to put one-fifth under arms.  Anindustrial State such as Germany cannot go to this extreme.  Yet byusing every means within her power she makes a very close approachto it.  In practically every village of which I secured figures inSaxony, Bavaria, Posen, East Prussia, West Prussia, Pomerania,Mecklenburg, and Oldenburg, a fifth or nearly a fifth have beencalled up.  In some Silesian and Rhenish-Westphalian districts,however, not more than from a seventh to a tenth.  If we allow forall Germany a little less than one-sixth, we get 11,000,000.What are the factors which enable Germany to call this number or alittle more than this number to the Colours?  First, theorganisation of the women.  I have seen them even in the forges ofRhineland doing the work of strong men.  "The finest women in theworld, these Rhinelanders," as one manager put it.  "Just look atthat one lift that weight.  Few men could do better."  And his eyessparkled with enthusiasm.Second, and of tremendous importance, are the huge numbers ofprisoners in Germany, and her sensible determination to make themwork.  She has taken about one and two-third millions on the fieldof battle.  _There also happen to be in Germany nearly a millionother prisoners, buried alive, whose existence has apparentlyescaped the notice of the outside world_.  These are the Russiancivilians who were caught in the German trap when it snappedsuddenly tight in the summer of 1914.  Before the war 2,000,000Russians used to go to Germany at harvest time.  The war began atharvest time.  The number of these men, which from my ownfirst-hand investigations in the remote country districts Iestimate at nearly a million, would have escaped my notice also,had I not walked across Germany.Another important factor in the labour problem in Germany is theemployment of the Poles.  Not only are they employed on the land,but great colonies of them have grown up in Dusseldorf and otherindustrial centres.  I saw an order instructing the militarycommandants throughout Germany to warn the Poles, whose discontentwith the food conditions in Germany made them desire to returnhome, that conditions in Poland were much worse.  This, then, is anofficial German admission that there is starvation in Poland, for_much worse_ could mean nothing else.  Germany is keeping Poland asealed book, although I admit that she occasionally takes touriststo see the German-fostered university at Warsaw.  Just before Ileft Germany still another order was issued for the regulation ofneutral correspondents.  Under no circumstances were they to beallowed to talk with the natives in Poland.  From unimpeachableauthority I learned that the Poles were intensely discouraged atthe thoroughness with which the Prussians stripped the countryafter the last harvest, and that in some sections the people areactually dying of hunger.  Even in Warsaw, the death-rate in someneighbourhoods has increased from 700 to 800 per cent.  I waswitness to German rage when Viscount Grey stipulated that foodcould be sent there only if the natives were allowed to have theproduce of their own land.  Prussia wanted that produce, and shegot it.I mention these supplies here because the Poles who worked toproduce them must be included in German labour estimates just asmuch as though they had been working in Germany.Germany also adds to her man-power by utilising her wounded so faras possible.  Her efforts in this direction are praiseworthy, sincethey not only contribute to the welfare of the State, but benefitthe individual.  I have seen soldiers with one leg gone, or partsof both legs gone, doing a full day's work mending uniforms.  Theblind are taught typewriting, which enables them to earn anindependent living in Government employ.  In short, work is foundfor everybody who can do anything at all.In a previous chapter I have spoken of the organisation of thechildren, a factor which should not be left out of consideration.      *      *      *      *      *Having considered the assets, let us turn to the debits.The German casualty lists to the end of 1916 total 4,010,160, ofwhich 909,665 have been killed or died of wounds.  Myinvestigations in Germany lead me to put the German killed or diedof wounds at 1,200,000, and the total casualties at close to5,000,000.  If we assume that 50 per cent. of all wounded return tothe front and another 25 per cent. to service in the interior, wemust also consider in computation of man-power that the casualtylists do not include the vast numbers of invalided, and the sick,which almost balance those that return to the front.  This means,in short, that the net losses are nearly as great at any one timeas the gross losses.  Consequently, according to my estimates theremust be at least 4,500,000 Germans out of action at this moment.In a war of attrition it is the number of men definitely out ofaction which counts, for the German lines can be successfullybroken, and only successfully broken, when there are not enough mento hold them.  The Germans now have in the West probably about 130divisions.Hindenburg's levies in the late summer were so enormous that I amconvinced from what I saw in Germany that she has now called almosteverything possible to the Colours.  One of Hindenburg'sstipulations in taking command was that he should always have aforce of half a million to throw wherever he wished.  We have seenthe result in Rumania, and the men skimmed from the training unitsthen have been replaced by this last great levy from civilian life.Therefore, with something over 11,000,000 men called up, Germanyhas now 6,000,000, or a little more all told, many of whom are notat all suited for service at the front.Germany on the defensive at the Somme certainly lost at least600,000 men.  Attrition, to be sure, works both ways, but if theGermans are out-gunned this year in the West to the extent expectedtheir position must become untenable.  The deadly work of reducingGerman man-power continues even though the Allied line does notadvance.  I know of a section of the German front opposite theFrench last winter which for five months did not have an action ofsufficient importance to be mentioned by either side in theofficial reports, yet the Germans lost 10 per cent. of theireffectives in killed.The more munitions the Allies make Germany use, the more fat shemust use for this purpose, and the less she will have for the civilpopulation, with a consequent diminution of their output of work.Germany simply cannot burn the candle at both ends.CHAPTER XXVBERLIN'S EAST-ENDThe poor of Berlin live in the north and east of the city.  I haveseen Berlin's East-end change from the hilarious joy of the firstyear of the war to an ever-deepening gloom.  I have studiedconditions there long and carefully, but I feel that I can do nobetter than describe my last Saturday in that interesting quarterof the German capital.Late in the morning I left the Stettiner Bahnhof in the north andwalked eastward through the Invalidenstrasse.  There waspractically no meat in the butchers' shops, just the customarylines of empty hooks.  A long queue farther on attracted myattention and I crossed the street to see what the people werewaiting for.  A glance at the dark red carcases in the shop told methat this was horse-meat day for that district.The number of vacant shops of all descriptions was increasing.  Thesmall shoemaker and tailor were closing up.  The centralisation offood distribution is greater here than in the better-classdistricts, with the result that many small shopkeepers have beendriven out of business.  In parts of Lothringerstrasse a quarter ofthe shops were vacant, in other parts one-half.  The bakers' shopsare nearly empty except at morning and evening.  In fact, after mylong sojourn in blockaded Germany I still find myself after twomonths in England staring in amazement at the well-stocked shopwindows of every description.Shortly before noon I reached the _Zentral Viehund-Schlachthof (theslaughter-houses).  Through a great gateway poured women andchildren, each carrying some sort of a tin or dish full of stew.Some of the children were scarcely beyond the age of babyhood, andtheir faces showed unmistakable traces of toil.  The poor littlethings drudged hard enough in peace time, and in war they aremerely part of the big machine.The diminishing supply of cattle and pigs for killing has affordedan opportunity to convert a section of the slaughter-houses intoone of the great People's Kitchens.  Few eat there, however.  Justbefore noon and at noon the people come in thousands for the stew,which costs forty pfennigs (about 5 pence) a quart, and a quart issupposed to be enough for a meal and a half.I have been in the great Schlachthof kitchen, where I have eatenthe stew, and I have nothing but praise for the work being done.This kitchen, like the others I have visited, is the last word inneatness.  The labour-saving devices, such as electricpotato-parers, are of the most modern type.  In fact, the war isincreasing the demand for labour-saving machinery in Germany to atleast as great an extent as high wages have caused such a demand inAmerica.  Among the women who prepare the food and wait upon thepeople there is a noticeable spirit of co-operation and a pride inthe part they are playing to help the Fatherland _durchhalten_(hold out).  Should any of the stew remain unsold it is taken by awell-known restaurant in the Potsdamer Platz, which has a contractwith the municipal authorities.  Little was wasted in Germanybefore the war; nothing, absolutely nothing, is wasted to-day.As at the central slaughter-house, so in other districts the poorare served in thousands with standard stew.  The immense AlexanderMarket has been cleared of its booths and tables and serves morethan 30,000 people.  One director of this work told me that theBerlin authorities would supply nearly 400,000 people before theend of the winter.The occasional soldier met in the streets looked shabbier in theshabby surroundings of the East.  The German uniform, which onceevoked unstinted praise, is suffering sadly to-day owing to lack ofraw materials.  I was in a Social Democratic district, but the menin uniform who were home on leave were probably "good" SocialDemocrats, since it is notorious that the regular variety aredenied this privilege.The faces of the soldiers were like the rest of the faces I sawthat day.  There was not the least trace of the cheerful, confidentexpression of the days when all believed that the Kaiser's armieswould hammer their way to an early peace--"in three months," aspeople used to say during the first year and a quarter of the war.Verdun had been promised them as a certain key to early peace, andAdmiral Scheer was deified as the immortal who tore loose theBritish clutch from the German throat.  But Verdun and Jutlandfaded in succeeding months before the terrible first-hand evidencethat the constant diminution of food made life a struggle day afterday and week after week.  The news from Rumania, though good, wouldbring them no cheer until it was followed by plenty of food.In the vicinity of the Schlesischer Bahnhof occurred a triflingincident which gave me an opportunity to see the inside of a poorGerman home that day.  A soldier in faded field-grey, home onleave, asked me for a match.  During the conversation whichfollowed I said that I was an American, but to my surprise he didnot make the usual German reply that the war would have been endedlong ago if it had not been for American ammunition.  On thecontrary, he showed an interest in my country, as he had a brotherthere, and finally asked me if I would step into his home andexplain a few things to him with the aid of a map.Though I was in a district of poverty the room I entered wascommendably clean.  An old picture of William I. hung on one wall;opposite was Bismarck.  Over the low door was an unframed portraitof "unser Kaiser," while Hindenburg completed the collection.Wooden hearts, on which were printed the names Liege, Maubeuge, andAntwerp, recalled the days when German hearts were light and Germantongues were full of brag.A girl of ten entered the room.  She hated the war because she hadto rush every day at noon from school to the People's Kitchen tofetch the family stew.  In the afternoon she had to look after theyounger children while her mother stood in the long lines beforethe shops where food was sold.  The family were growing tired ofstew day after day.  They missed the good German sausage andunlimited amount of bread and butter.The mother looked in on her way to the street, basket under arm.She was tired, and was dulled by the daily routine of trying to getfood.  She talked bitterly about the war, but though she blamed theAgrarians for not doing their part to relieve the food situation,she expressed no animosity against her own Government.  The fatherhad been through Lodz in Hindenburg's two frontal assaults onWarsaw, where he had seen the slopes covered with forests ofcrosses marking the German dead, and his words were bitter, too,when he talked of his lost comrades.  And then, the depressingfeeling of returning from an army pursuing the mirage of victory tofind his family and every other family struggling in the meshes ofthat terrible and relentless blockade!It never had occurred to him that his Government might be in theleast responsible for the misery of his country.  Like the greatbulk of the German people he is firmly convinced that theFatherland has been fighting a war of defence from the verybeginning.  "To think that one nation, England, is responsible forall this suffering!" was the way that he put it.  He is a "good"Social Democrat.When I once more resumed my walk I saw the lines of people waitingfor food in every street.  Each time I turned a corner great blackmasses dominated the scene.  I paused at a line of more than threehundred waiting for potatoes.  Ten yards away not a sound could beheard.  The very silence added to the depression.  With facesanxious and drawn they stood four abreast, and moved with theorderliness of soldiers.  Not a sign of disturbance, and not apoliceman in sight.  Some women were mending socks; a few, standingon the edge of the closely packed column, pushed baby carriages asthey crawled hour after hour toward the narrow entrance of the shop.Every line was like the rest.  The absence of policemen isparticularly noteworthy, since they had to be present in the earlydays--a year ago--when the butter lines came into being.  Drasticmeasures were taken when the impatient women rioted.  Those daysare over.  The Government has taught the people a lesson.  Theywill wait hour after hour, docile and obedient henceforth, ifnecessary until they drop--make no mistake of that.But the authorities also learned a lesson.  "People think most ofrevolution when they are hungry," was what one leader said to me.On this Saturday of which I write not a potato was to be bought inthe West-end of Berlin, where the better classes live.  Berlin hadbeen without potatoes for nearly a week.  To-day they had arrived,and the first to come were sent to the East-end.  In the West-endthe people are filled with more unquestioning praise of everythingthe Government does; they applaud when their Kaiser confers anOrder upon their Crown Prince for something, not quite clear, whichhe is supposed to have accomplished at Verdun.  Therefore they canwait for potatoes until the more critical East-end is supplied.I went farther eastward through the Kottbuser district to theKottbuser Ufer on the canal, along which, a couple of hundredpeople waited in an orderly column without any guardian--anotherevidence of the success of the drastic measures of July and earlyAugust, when the demonstrations against the war were nipped in thebud.  These people were waiting for the free advertisement sheetsfrom the gaudily painted yellow Ullstein newspaper building acrossthe square.  They had to stand by the side of the canal because a_queue_ of several hundred people waiting for potatoes wound slowlybefore Ullstein's to the underground potato-shop next door.I had not heard a laugh or seen anybody smile all day, and whendarkness fell on the weary city I went to a cheap little beer-roomwhere several "bad," but really harmless Social Democrats used togather.  Among them was the inevitable one who had been to America,and I had become acquainted with them through him.  They talked inthe new strain of their type, that they might as well be under theBritish or French, as under their own Government.Their voices were low--a rare event where Germans gather at table.They did not plot, they merely grumbled incessantly.  The end ofthe war had definitely sunk below their horizon, and peace, notmerely steps to peace, was what they longed for.  There was thecustomary cursing of the Agrarians and the expressions of resolveto have a new order of freedom after the war, expressions which Ibelieve will not be realised unless Germany is compelled to acceptpeace by superior forces from without.I left the dreary room for the dreary streets, and turned towardsthe centre and West-end of Berlin, where the _cafe_ lights werebright and tinkling music made restricted menu-cards easier to bear.Suddenly the oppressive feeling of the East-end was dispelled bythe strains of military music drawing closer in a street near by.I hurried towards it, and saw a band marching at the head of twocompanies of wounded soldiers, their bandages showing white underthe bright street lights of Berlin.The men were returning to their hospital off the Prenzlauer Alleefrom a day's outing on the River Spree.  Scores of followersswelled to hundreds.  The troubles of the day were forgotten.  Eyesbrightened as the throng kept step with the martial music.  A rollof drum, a flare of brass, and the crowd, scattered voices atfirst, and then swelling in a grand crescendo, sang _Deutschlanduber Alles_.  To-morrow they would complain again of food shortageand sigh for peace, but tonight they would dream of victory.CHAPTER XXVIIN THE DEEPENING SHADOWA little, bent old woman, neat, shrivelled, with clear, healthy eyeand keen intelligence, was collecting acorns in the park outsidethe great Schloss, the residence of von Oppen, a relative of thePolice President of Berlin.I had walked long and was about to eat my picnic lunch, and stoppedand spoke with her.  We soon came to the one topic in Germany--thewar.  She was eighty-four years of age, she told me, and she workedfor twelve hours a day.  Her mother had seen Napoleon pass throughthe red-roofed village hard by.  She well remembered what shecalled "the Bismarck wars."  She was of the old generation, for shespoke of the Kaiser as "the King.""No," she said, "this war is not going like the Bismarck wars--notlike the three that happened in 1864, 1866, 1870, within sevenyears when I was a young woman."  She was referring, of course, toDenmark, Austria, and France.  "We have lost many in ourvillage--food is hard to get."  Here she pointed to the two thinslices of black bread which were to form her mid-day meal.  She didnot grumble at her twelve hours' day in the fields, which were inaddition to the work of her little house, but she wished that shecould have half an hour in which to read history.Her belief was that the war would be terminated by the Zeppelins."When our humane King really gives the word, the English ships andtowns will all be destroyed by our Zeppelins.  He is holding backhis great secret of destruction out of kindness."The remark of that simple, but intelligent old woman as to therestraint imposed by the Kaiser upon the Zeppelins constituted theuniversal belief of all Germany until the British doggedly built upan air service under the stress of necessity, which has brilliantlychecked the aerial carnival of frightfulness.  People in GreatBritain seem to have no conception of the great part the Zeppelinswere to play in the war, according to German imagination.  Thatsimple old peasant lady expressed the views that had been utteredto me by intelligent members of the Reichstag--bankers, merchants,men and women of all degrees.  The first destruction ofZeppelins--that by Lieutenant Warneford, and the bringing down ofLZ77 at Revigny, did not produce much disappointment.  The war wasgoing well in other directions.  But the further destruction ofZeppelins has had almost as much to do with the desire for peace,in the popular mind, as the discomfort and illness caused by foodshortage and the perpetual hammerings by the French and BritishArmies in the West.It should be realised that the Zeppelin has been a fetish of theGermans for the last ten years.  The Kaiser started the worship bypublicly kissing Count Zeppelin, and fervently exclaiming that hewas the greatest man of the century.  Thousands of pictures havebeen imagined of Zeppelins dropping bombs on Buckingham Palace, theBank of England, and the Grand Fleet.  For a long time, owing tothe hiding of the facts in England of the Zeppelin raids, even highGerman officials believed that immense damage had been done.  TheFrench acted more wisely.  They allowed full descriptions of theaeroplane and Zeppelin raids in France to be published, and theresult was discouraging to the Germans.  I remember studying theBritish Zeppelin communiques with Germans.  At that time the LondonAuthorities were constantly referring to these raids taking placein the "Eastern counties," when the returned Germans knew exactlywhere they had been.  The result was great encouragement.  Nothingdid more to depress the Germans than the humorous and true accountsof the Zeppelin raids which were eventually allowed to appear inthe English newspapers.The Germans have now facts as to the actual damage done in England.They know that the British public receive the Zeppelins withexcellent aircraft and gun-fire.   They know that anti-aircraftpreparations are likely to increase rather than decrease, andwhile, for the sake of saving the nation's "face," it will benecessary that Zeppelins be further used, the people who aredirecting the war know that, so far as land warfare is concerned,they are not a factor.There have been more mishaps than have been published; more woundedand damaged Zeppelins than the Germans have ever announced.  I wasinformed that the overhauling and repair of many Zeppelins after asuccessful or unsuccessful raid was a matter, not of days, but ofweeks.  There was great difficulty in obtaining crews.  Most ofthem are sailors, as are the officers.  There have been suppressedmutinies in connection with the manning of the Zeppelins.Count Zeppelin, who, up to a year ago, was a national hero, isalready regarded by a large section of the population as a failure.The very house servants who subscribed their pfennigs and marks inthe early days to help conduct his experiments now no longer speakof him with respect.  They have transferred their admiration toHindenburg and the submarines.The majority of Germans of all classes believe what they areofficially instructed to believe, no more, no less.  Theovermastering self-hypnotism which leads the present-day German tobelieve that black is white, if it adds to his self-satisfaction,is one of the most startling phenomena of history.  But what ofBallin, Heineken, von Gwinner, Gutmann, Thyssen, Rathenau, andother captains of industry and finance?  Some of them haveexpressed opinions in interviews, but what do they _really_ think?I am not going to indulge in any guesswork on this matter.  I amsimply going to disclose some important statements made at a secretmeeting attended by many of the business directors of the GermanEmpire.  The meeting was for the purpose of discussing actualconditions in a straightforward manner, therefore no member of thePress, German or foreign, was present.In striking contrast with custom when the war is discussed, nothingwas said of _Kultur_, of German innocence or enemy guilt, of anearly and victorious peace, of British warships hiding always insafety, or of the omniscience and infallibility of the SupremeMilitary Command.The little circle of Germans who have displayed such brilliantorganising ability in commerce and industry are practical men, wholook at the war and the days to follow the war in the cold light ofdebit and credit.  This being the case, the honest opinionsexpressed by Arthur von Gwinner, President of the Deutsche Bank,are worthy of serious consideration.  His chief points were:--1. The belief cherished by the mass of the nation that a CentralEurope Economic Alliance will amply compensate us for anyshortcomings elsewhere, and enable us to sit back and snap ourfingers at the rest of the world is too absurd to be entertained byserious men.  Our trade, import and export, with Austria-Hungarywas as great as it could be for many years to come, and it was onlya small part of our total trade.  After the war, as before, thebulk of our trade must be with countries now neutral or enemy, andwe must seriously consider how to hold and add to this trade in thefuture.2.  The solution of the labour problem will be vital in the work ofreconstruction.  We must make every provision in order to forgerapidly ahead immediately after the close of the war._No German, except for necessary reasons of State, should beallowed to leave the country for a number of years after the war_.3. Before the war 3,000,000 Russians came to us every year atharvest time.  These must continue to come.4. We have done wonderful work in scientific agriculture, but thelimit of productivity of the soil has undoubtedly been reached.5. Do not place too much hope in an early war between the UnitedStates and Japan.6. There is great rejoicing over the sinking of enemy ships.  Itshould also be remembered, however, that we are not paying anydividends at present.In the discussion which followed the statements of Herr von Gwinnerand from various channels of reliable information which I made useof in Germany, I found a serious view taken of these and othertopics, of which the great body of Germans are quite unaware.Take the labour problem, for example.  For years Germany hasrecognised the necessity of a rapid increase of population, if anation is to smash rivals in industry and war.  Not for a momentduring this struggle has Germany lost sight of this fact.  Manytimes have I heard in the Fatherland that the assurance of milk tochildren is not entirely for sentimental but also for practicalreasons.  Official attempts are being made at present to increasethe population in ways which cannot be discussed in this book."You get yourself born and the State does all the rest" was anaccurate analysis of Germany before the war; but the State looksafter everything now.When men go home on leave from the army, married or single, theyare instructed in their duty of doing their part to increase thepopulation so that Germany will have plenty of colonists for theBalkans, Turkey and Asia in the great economic development of thoseregions.  To impress this they argue that Germany and France hadnearly the same number of inhabitants in 1870.  "See the differenceto-day," says the German.  "This difference is one of the chiefcauses of our greatly superior strength."Working girls in Dresden have not only been encouraged but quietlyadvised to serve the State "by enabling Deutschland to achieve thehigh place in the world which God marked out for it, which can onlybe done if there are a sufficient number of Germans to make theirinfluence felt in the world."  They have been told not to worry,that the State will provide for the offspring.  In fact, societiesof godfathers and godmothers are growing all over Germany.  They donot necessarily have to bring up the child in their own home; theycan pay for its maintenance.  Thus the rich woman who does not careto have many children herself is made to feel in ultra-scientificGermany that she should help her poorer sister.The Germans treat the matter very lightly.  In Bremen, for example,where the quartering of Landsturmers (the oldest Germans called tomilitary service) among the people resulted in a large batch ofillegitimate children, I found it the custom, even in mixed societyof the higher circles, to refer to them jokingly as "youngLandsturmers."A serious consideration of what Germany, or any other belligerent,will do _after_ the war is usually of little value, as conditionsafter the war depend upon what is done _during_ the war.  Theamount of freedom which the German people attain in the next fewyears is in direct proportion to the amount of thrashingadministered to their country by the Allies.  Perhaps they willhave something to say about the frontier regulations of Germany;but assuming that the training of centuries will prevent theirhastily casting aside their docility, it is extremely probable thatfew, if any, Germans will be allowed to leave Germany during thefirst years of reconstruction.This will disappoint several million Germans.  Despite the snarlingrage displayed everywhere in the fatherland, except in diplomaticcircles, against the United States, I heard an ever-increasingnumber of malcontents declare that, immediately after the close ofwar, they would go to the States to escape the burden of taxation.One hears two words--_Friede_ (peace) and _Essen_(food)--constantly.   The third word I should add is _Steuern_(taxes).  It is all very well to sit by some neutral firesidereading Goethe or Schopenhauer, while listening to the_Meistersinger von Nurnberg_, or the "Melody in F," and lullyourself into the belief that the Germans are a race of idealists.This touch is used to a considerable extent in German propaganda.Any one familiar, however, with conditions in modern Germany knowsthat Germans are ultra-materialistic.I have heard them talk of the cost of the war from the verybeginning.  They gloated over the sweeping indemnities they wouldexact.  After they realised the possibilities of State-organisedscientific burglary in Belgium they were beside themselves injoyful anticipation of what Paris, London, and a score of othercities would yield.  When the war became a temporary stalemate, Iheard it said, particularly by army officers, that Germany wastaking no chances with the future, but was exacting indemnities nowfrom the occupied districts.  When taxes rose and food shortageincreased, the possibility that the Germans themselves would haveto pay some of their own costs of the war in various forms oftaxation determined a rapidly growing number to seek a way out byemigrating at the first opportunity.As Herr Ballin said, "The world will find us as strongly organisedfor peace as we were organised for war."  The labour problem,however, not only now, but for the days of reconstruction, isviewed very seriously, how seriously may be gathered from the factthat there is so much apprehension that Russia may refuse to allowher workers to go to Germany for some years after the war, thatnearly everyone at the secret conference mentioned above was infavour of making concessions at the peace conference, should Russiainsist.  Indeed one Rhinelander was of the opinion that it would beworth while giving up Courland to get an unlimited supply of labour.In the meantime the Germans have not been idle in other directions.Until Hindenburg called up his immense levies in the late summer,Germany exported steel building materials and coal to contiguousneutral countries, but she can no longer do this.  Nevertheless,she did make elaborate preparations to "dump" into Russia on acolossal scale immediately after the resumption of intercourse.Immense supplies of farming implements and other articles of steelhave been stored in the Rhineland, Westphalia, and Silesia, readyfor immediate shipment to Russia, thus enabling Germany to getahead of all rivals in this field.Germans also derive comfort from the fact that their ships will beready at once to carry cargoes and passengers, while so many ofthose of the Allies will be used for the transport of troops afterthe close of the war, and must then rent.With such plans for "getting the jump" on competitors it is onlynatural that I saw more and more irritability on the part of thefinancial men with each month of the war after last April.Von Gwinner's remark about the improbability of war between Japanand the United States in the near future would, if known to theGerman people, cause still another keen disappointment, since oneof their solaces has been the thought that they would soon have anopportunity of reaping a munition harvest themselves.When Germany tried to make a separate peace with Russia, Japan wasalso approached--how far, I do not know.  The Wilhelmstrasse stillmaintains a Japanese department, and any possible thread, howeverlight, which may be twisted from a Tokyo newspaper to show thatperhaps Japan may be won over, is pounced upon most eagerly.Germany, Japan, and Russia was the combination whispered in Berlinat the time of the unsuccessful attempt to separate the Allies.Absolute governments have certain advantages in war.  They havealso disadvantages.  When things are not running smoothly inGermany the Germans worry more than do the English when things arenot going well in England.  When the German leaders began todisagree as to the best methods to conduct the war, the effect uponthe people was demoralising.  Only their gullibility saved themfrom complete dismay, Month after month the great struggle raged,under the surface for the most part, but occasionally boiling over.Would it be to the best interests of Germany to go the limit withthe submarines or not?  Not once did I hear the subject discussedon ethical grounds.  Some remarks made to me by Doctor Stresemann,one of the powerful rational Liberals behind the mammoth industrialtrust in Germany, and the most violent apostle of frightfulness inthe Reichstag, aptly express the sentiment in favour ofunrestricted submarine warfare.  He and the rest of the men behindTirpitz had fought and lost in the three Committee assembliescalled to discuss U-boat policy in 1916.As the day set for the September meeting of the Reichstagapproached I noticed that Herr Stresemann was growing more and moreexcited.  "This war is lasting too long," he declared to me ingreat agitation.  "The Kaiser's most glaring fault is that oftrying to fight Great Britain with one foot in the grave ofchivalry.  If the Chancellor continues to sway him, we will wreckthe Chancellor at all costs.  The only way to win this war is topublish again, and this time enforce, the decree of February 4th,1915, warning all neutrals to keep out of the submarine zone.""But, according to the '_Sussex_ Ultimatum,' that will cause abreak with the United States," I said."We cannot let that deter us," he declared.  "Britain is thekeystone of our enemies.  If she falls they all fall.  We mustattack her where she is vulnerable.  _We must starve her out_.  Asfor America, we have little to fear from her.  In the first place,although she may break off diplomatic relations, she will not enterthe war if we are careful not to sink _her_ ships.  As Americanships play a small part in the carrying trade to England, we canthus refrain from sinking them--although we naturally should notproclaim this."In the second place, if America does declare war upon Germany, itwould have little effect.  The war will be over before she canorganise after the manner of Great Britain.  Herr Helfferich(former Minister of Finance and now Vive-Chancellor) feels that weshould do everything possible to keep America out, inasmuch asthereby we shall be in a better position to conclude commercialtreaties after the war.  Herr Helfferich exerted powerful influencein the meeting at Great Headquarters at the time of the SussexCrisis.  But our duty to ourselves is to win the war.  If we starveout England we win, no matter how many enemies we have.  If wefail, another enemy, even the United States, would not make ourdefeat more thorough.  We are justified, for our existence is atstake.  The only way we can escape defeat is by a successful U-boatwar against England.  That would change defeat into overwhelmingvictory.  I am absolutely confident; that is why the slow methodsof the Chancellor make me so angry.  It will take at least half ayear to bring England to her knees, and with our increasedprivations he may wait too long.  But we shall compel him; we shallcompel him."Herr Stresemann later requested me not to publish thesestatements--at least, not until a decision had been reached.  Idid, however, lay the matter before the American Embassy in Londonas soon as I arrived in England, since my investigations in Germanyleft no doubt in my mind that she would play two great cards--one,to work for peace through negotiation; the other, the lastdesperate recourse to the submarine.As I write (January 21st, 1917) I am convinced that it is only aquestion of time until Germany is reduced to this last desperateresort.  The men, who will decide that time will be Hindenburg andBatocki.  The successful siege of Germany is a stupendous thoughnot impossible task.On the other hand, the human system is a very elastic piece ofmechanism, and modern man, far from being the degenerate which someadmirers of cave-man hardihood have pictured him, is able toundergo a tremendous amount of privation.  Besieged cities havenearly always held out longer than the besiegers expected.  In thebesieged city the civilian population is for the most part a dragon the military, but in besieged Germany the civilian population,reinforced by slave labour from Belgium, France and Poland,continues working at high pressure in order to enable the militaryto keep the field.  Fat is the vital factor.  The more munitionsGermany heaps up the more fat she must use for this purpose, andthe less she will have for the civil population, with a consequentdiminution of their output of work.  Germany simply cannot burn thecandle at both ends.  It is my personal opinion that Verdun marksthe supreme culmination of German military offensive in the West,and the West is the decisive theatre of war.  If that isHindenburg's opinion, then he realises that another colossal Germanoffensive in the West would not bring a victorious peace.  Thereremains only the alternative of building up a defensive against thecoming Allied attacks--an alternative depending for its successupon sufficient food for the mass of the people.  Thus the U-boatdecision clearly rests upon the Chief of Staff and the FoodDictator, since their advice to the Imperial Chancellor and the AllHighest War Lord must be determinative.  When the day comes forGermany to proclaim to the world that she will sink at sight allships going to and from the ports of her enemies, that day will beone of the great moments of history.  Germany's last card will beon the table.  It will be war to the knife.  Either she will starveGreat Britain or Great Britain, will starve her.These are problems for the leaders, who have the further task ofkeeping the population hopeful on an alarmingly decreasing diet.Superficially, or until you want something to eat, or a ride in ataxicab, Berlin at night is gay.  But you somehow feel that thegaiety is forced.  London at first sight is appallingly gloomy isthe evening, and foreigners hardly care to leave their hotels.  ButI find that behind the gloom and the darkness there is plenty ofspontaneous merriment at the theatres and other places ofentertainment.  There is plenty of food, little peace talk, andquiet confidence.Across the North Sea, however, great efforts are made by the GermanGovernment to keep up the spirits of the people.  No publicentertainer need go to the war at all, and the opera is carried onexactly as in peace time, though I confess that my material soulfound it difficult to enjoy Tristan on a long and monotonous dietof sardines, potatoes, cheese and fresh-water fish--chiefly pikeand carp.  A humorous American friend used to laugh at thesituation--the brilliantly dressed house, officers in theirextremely handsome grey uniforms, ladies, some of them with toomany diamonds, and--very little to eat.At the slightest military gain the bells of victory peal wildly,and gay flags colour mile after mile of city streets, flags underwhich weary, silent women crawl in long lines to the shops wherefood is sold.  A bewildering spectacle is this crawling throughvictory after victory ever nearer to defeat.Early in the war a Norwegian packer, who had not had much demandfor his sardines in Germany, put the picture of Hindenhurg on thetins and christened them the "Hindenburg Sardines."  When hechanged the trade-mark the Germans bought them as fast as he couldsupply them--not because they were short of food at that time, butthrough the magic of a name.  To-day all that is changed.Norwegians no longer have to flatter the Germans, who are anxiousto buy anything in the way of food.  They flood Germany now withimpunity with sardines whose merits are extolled in the hatedEnglish language, sardines which had originally been intended forBritain or America, but which are now eagerly snapped up at fourand five times the peace price by people who invariably bid oneanother good-bye with "Gott strafe England."  I saw the gem of thecollection in a Friedrichstrasse window.  It was entitled: "OurAllies Brand," on a bright label which displayed the flags of GreatBritain, Prance, Russia, Italy, Belgium and Japan.In Germany you feel that the drama of the battlefield has changedto the drama of the larder.  Hope and despair succeed one anotherin the determination to hold out economically while soldier andsailor convince the world that Germany cannot be beaten.  Peoplelaugh at the blockade, sneer at the blockade and curse the blockadein the same breath.  A headline of victory, a mention of the army,the army they love, and they boast again.  Then a place in the foodline, or a seat at table, and they whine at the long war and rageagainst "British treachery."  Like a cork tossing on thewaves--such is the spirit of Germany.The majority struggle on in the distorted belief that Germany wasforced to defend herself from attack planned by Great Britain,while the minority are kept in check by armed patrols and"preventive arrest."The spirit of "all for the Fatherland" is yielding to the spirit ofself-preservation of the individual.  Everywhere one sees evidenceof this.  The cry of a little girl running out of a meat shop inFriedenau, an excellent quarter of Berlin, brought me in to find awoman, worn out with grief over the loss of her son and the longwaiting in the _queue_ for food, lying on the floor in asemi-conscious condition.  It is the custom to admit five or sixpeople at a time.  I was at first surprised that nobody in the lineoutside had stirred at the appeal of the child, but I need not haveexpected individual initiative even under the most extenuatingcircumstances from people so slavishly disciplined that they wouldstolidly wait their turn.  But the four women inside--why did theynot help the woman?  The spirit of self-preservation must be theanswer.  For them the main event of the day was to secure thehalf-pound of meat which would last them for a week.  They simplywould not be turned from that one objective until it was reached.And the soldiers passing through Berlin!  I saw some my lastafternoon in Berlin, loaded with their kit, marching silently downUnter den Linden to the troop trains, where a few relatives wouldtearfully bid them good-bye.  There was not a sound in theirranks--only the dull thud of their heavy marching boots.  Theydidn't sing nor even speak.  The passers-by buttoned their coatsmore tightly against the chill wind and hurried on their severalways, with never a thought or a look for the men in field-grey,moving, many of them for the last time, through the streets of thecapital.  The old man who angered the war-mad throng before the_Schloss_ on August 1st, 1914, with his discordant croak of "War isa serious business, young man," lives in the spirit of to-day.  Andhe did not have to go to the mountain!CHAPTER XXVIIACROSS THE NORTH SEAAfter my last exit from Germany into Holland I was confronted by anew problem.  I had found going to England very simple on myprevious war-time crossings.  Now, however, there were twoobstacles in my path--first, to secure permission to Board a vesselbound for England; secondly, to make the actual passage safely.The passport difficulty was the first to overcome.  The passportwith which I had come to Europe before the war, and which had beencovered with frontier _visees_, secret service permissions andmilitary permissions, from the Alps to the White Sea and from theThames to the Black Sea, had been cancelled in Washington at myrequest during my brief visit home in the autumn of 1915.  On mylast passport I had limited the countries which I intended to visitto Germany and Austria-Hungary.  I purposed adding to this list asI had done on my old passport, but subsequent American regulations,aimed at restricting travellers to one set of belligerents,prevented that.I was not only anxious to return to London to continue my work withLord Northcliffe on _The Times_ and the _Daily Mail_, but I wasencouraged by two American officials in Germany and Austria-Hungaryto write the truth about Germany--a feat quite impossible, as oneof them said to me, for a correspondent remaining in the zone ofthe Central Powers.  The official in Austria-Hungary had becomerighteously indignant at the sneering German remarks about how theycould "play with Washington in the U-boat question."  He asked meto learn all possible news of submarines.  The official in Germanyhad been impressed by my investigations among the men behindTirpitz, men who never for a moment ceased in their efforts to turnon frightfulness in full force.  When I mentioned the new Americanpassport regulations which would delay me getting to England, hesaid: "In Holland fix it with the British.  I hope you will do somegood with all this information, for you have the big scoop of theday.  Now is the time."I tried to "fix it" with the British authorities in Rotterdam, butas they did not know me my progress was slow for a few days.  ThenI went to Amsterdam to my old newspaper friend, Charles Tower,correspondent for the _Daily Mail_, a man of broad experience, andin close touch with affairs in Holland, a country which warjournalists have grown to look upon as an important link in thenews chain between Germany and England.  I realised that this movemight confirm the suspicions of von Kuhlmann's spies who were on mytrail.  However, the free air of Holland was making me a littleincautious, a little over-confident."There is the man who is following you," said Tower, as we steppedin the evening from his home on to the brightly lighted street andmade our way along the edge of the canals.  The tall,round-shouldered German shadowed us through the crowded streets tothe Amstel Hotel.  Then we shadowed him, while he telephoned forhelp which came in the form of a persistent Hollander, who insistedin sitting at the table next to us, although it had just beenvacated by diners and needed re-arranging, whereas many othertables were entirely free.That is a sample of the manner in which we were systematicallyspied upon.  In order to make arrangements it was necessary for usto travel together so that we could talk, as our time was limited.It was absolutely impossible for us to go into a restaurant or getinto a railway compartment without having a satellite at our elbow.They were very persistent and very thorough; but the system inHolland has the same glaring flaw that is common to the Germansystem everywhere--too much system and not sufficient cleverness inthe individual.Von Kuhlmann, the German Minister, certainly does not lack men.  Weencountered them everywhere.  Travelling first class gives one moreor less privacy in Holland, so that it was decidedly irritating tohave a listener make for our compartment, while adjoiningfirst-class compartments were entirely empty.  If the intrusionresulted in our going to another compartment, an ever-ready_Kamerad_ would quickly join us.In all countries Germany considers certain telephone connections tobe of great strategic importance.  It is practically impossible tobe connected with the British Consulate at Rotterdam, until the"interpreter" is put on.  Mr. Tower experiences the same annoyance.Indeed, the Germans are extremely attentive to him, Although heneeds only a small flat, since he lives alone, he has to protecthimself by hiring the floor above and the floor below, as theGermans are continually trying to get rooms as close to him aspossible.  The German Government has for years been pouring outmoney like water to conquer the world.  If I were a German taxpayerI should feel much like the man who discovers that the Florida landwhich some smooth-talking combination travelling book-agent andreal estate agent persuaded him to buy is several feet under water.Tower and the British authorities finally obtained permission forme to land in England, but they insisted that it would be worsethan useless for me to attempt to go on a Dutch steamer, as Ishould be taken off.  Within a week two of these steamers had beenconducted by the Germans to Zeebrugge.After I had left word that I wished to go at the first possibleopportunity, and had received some further instructions, Tower andI left for Rotterdam on our last train ride together in Holland.The little man with the book who sat beside us in the tram to theCentral station turned us over to a big man with whitish eyebrowsand reddish hair and moustache, who followed us into a second-classcompartment, which we had entered purposely, although we had boughtfirst-class tickets.  We then pretended to discover our mistake andchanged to a vacant first-class compartment.  Through some rareoversight there was no _Kamerad_ on hand, whereupon the man withthe reddish hair followed us with the patheticallyfeeble-explanation that he, too, had made the same mistake.When Tower and I had talked _ad nauseam_ on such fiercely neutralsubjects as Dutch cheese and Swiss scenery, I felt an impellingdesire to "get even" with the intruder, and began to complain toTower of the injustice of the British not allowing me to return toAmerica via England, which I wished to see for a few days.  He tookthe cue readily, and accused me of being "fed-up like all neutralcorrespondents in Berlin."  He frankly expressed his disgust at theenthusiasm which he declared that I had been showing for everythingGerman since I met him in Holland.  As the train pulled into theHague, where I prepared to leave him, he concluded by saying,"After all, you ought not to blame the British authorities forrefusing you permission to go to England.  I have done my best andhave failed; there is nothing more that I can do.  I did get oneconcession for you, however.  You will not be roughly handled orotherwise maltreated when your vessel touches at Falmouth."I had to make a serious effort to keep a straight face whileleaving the train with this last realistic touch of "Britishbrutality" ringing in my ears.  Tower, I might add, had voiced theextraordinary myth one hears in the Fatherland about the terriblemanner in which the British treat passengers on neutral steamerstouching at their ports.The man with the reddish hair followed me to the office of theHolland-America Line, where I made application for a reservation onthe boat which would sail in a week or ten days.  From there I wentto a small restaurant.  He seemed satisfied and left me, whereuponI followed him.  He hurried to the large Cafe Central, steppedstraight to a table in the front room, which is level with thestreet, and seated himself beside a thin, dark German of theintellectual type who appeared to be awaiting him.  From my seat inthe shadows of the higher room I watched with amusement theincreasingly puzzled expression on the face of the intellectualGerman while the man with the reddish hair unfolded his tale.  Whenthey parted my curiosity caused me to trail after the thin, darkman.  He went straight to the German Legation.For two days I nervously paced up and down the sands atScheveningen looking out upon the North Sea and waiting for thecall.  It came one short drizzly afternoon.  The Germans, ofcourse, knew the whereabouts of the vessel on which I should embarkfor England, though it is highly improbable that they knew thesailing time, and they did not know when I should go on it.I did everything possible to throw any possible spies off the trailas I made my way in the dark to a lonely wharf on the Maas Riverwhere I gave the password to a watchman who stepped out of a blackcorner near the massive gates which opened to the pier.I went aboard a little five hundred ton vessel with steam up, andstood near two other men on the narrow deck, where I watched inconsiderable awe the silent preparations to cast away.A man stepped out of the cabin.  "I presume, sir, that you are theAmerican journalist," he said.  He explained that he was thesteward.  From the bridge came the voice of the captain, "We cangive them only a few minutes more," he said.Two minutes of silence, broken only by the gentle throbbing of theengines.   Then from the blackness near the street gate came thesound of hurrying feet.  I could make out three stumbling figures,apparently urged along by a fourth.  "Who are they?" I asked thesteward."They must be the three Tommies who escaped from Germany.  Bravelads they are.  A couple more days and we'll have them hack inEngland.""A couple of days?" I exclaimed.  "Why, it's only eight hours tothe Thames estuary, isn't it?""Eight hours in peace time; and eight hours for Dutch boatsnow--when the Germany don't kidnap them away to Zeebrugge.  But thecourse to the Thames is not our course.  The old fourteen-hour tripto Hull often takes us forty now.  Every passage is different, too.It isn't only on the sea that the Germans try to bother us; theyalso keep after us when we are in port here.  Only yesterday theDutch inspectors did us a good turn by arresting five spiesmonkeying around the boat--three Germans and two Dutchmen."The little vessel was headed into the stream now, the three Tommieshad gone inside, followed a little later by the two men who were onthe deck when I arrived, men who talked French.  When the stewardleft I was alone on the deck.I watched the receding lights of Rotterdam till they flickered outin the distance.  The night was misty and too dark to make outanything on shore.  My thoughts went back to the last time, nearlya year before, when I had been on that river.  I saw it then, inflood of moonlight as I stepped on the boat deck of the giant liner_Rotterdam_.  The soft strains of a waltz floated up from the musicroom, adding enchantment to the windmills and low Dutch farmhousesstrung out below the level of the water.At that time my thoughts were full of my coming attempt to get intoGermany, a Germany which was smashing through Serbia, and alreadyplanning the colossal onslaught against Verdun, the onslaught whichshe hoped would put France out of the war.  I had got into Germany,but for a long time I had almost despaired of getting out; twice Ihad been turned back courteously but firmly from the frontiers,once when I tried to cross to Switzerland and again when I startedfor Denmark.  A reliable friend had told me that the Wilhelmstrassehad suspected me but could prove nothing against me.  The daybefore I felt Germany I was called to the Wilhelmstrasse, where Ireceived the interesting and somewhat surprising information thatthe greatest good that a correspondent could do in the world be touse his influence to bring the United States and Germany to abetter understanding.  I made neither comment nor promise.  I waswell aware that the same Wilhelmstrasse, while laying the wires foran attempt to have my country play Germany's game, was sedulouslycontinuing its propaganda of _Gott strafe Amerika_ among the Germanpeople.  As in the hatred sown against Great Britain hate againstAmerica was sown so that the Government would have a united Germanybehind them in case of war.I was at last out of Germany, but the lights of the Hook of Hollandreminded me that a field of German activity lay ahead--floatingmines, torpedoes, submarines, and swift destroyers operating fromOstend and Zeebrugge.  They are challenging British supremacy inthe southern part of the North Sea, through the waters of which wemust now feel our way.We were off the Hook running straight to the open sea.  The nervousfeeling of planning and delay of the last few days gave way now tothe exhilaration which comes of activity in danger.  If the Germansshould get us, the least that would happen to me would beinternment until the end of the war.  I was risking everything onthe skill and pluck of the man who paced the bridge above my head,and on the efficiency of the British patrol of the seas.The little steamer suddenly began to plunge and roll with the waveswashing her decks when I groped my way, hanging to the rail, to thesnug cabin where six men sat about the table.  The pallor of theirfaces made them appear wax-like in the yellow light of the smokingoil lamp which swung suspended overhead.  Three of them wereBritish, two were Belgian, and one was French, but there was acommon bond which drew them together in a comradeship whichtranscends all harriers of nationality, for they had escaped from acommon enemy.They welcomed me to the table.  It is surprising what a degree ofintimacy can spring up between seven men, all with historiesbehind, and all with the same hope of getting to England.  Theywere only beginning to find themselves, they were indeed stillgroping to pick up the threads of reality of a world from whichthey had been snatched two years before.The Englishman at my right, a corporal, had been taken prisonerwith a bullet in his foot at the retreat from Mons.  In the summerof 1916 he had been sent to a punishment work camp near Windau inCourland.  I had already heard unsavoury rumours of this camp whileI was in Germany, of men forced to toil until they dropped in theirtracks, of an Englishman shot simply because his guard was in badtemper.  But the most damning arraignment of Windau came from ayoung Saxon medical student, who told me that after he hadqualified, for a commission as second lieutenant he declined toaccept it.  This was such an unusual occurrence in a country wherethe army officer is a semi-deity that I was naturally curious toknow why."I am loyal to the Fatherland," the young Saxon said to me, "and Iam not afraid to die.  I was filled with enthusiasm to receive acommission, but all that enthusiasm died when I saw the way Russianprisoners were treated in East Prussia and at Windau.  I saw themstripped to the waist under orders from the camp officers, tied totrees and lashed until the blood flowed.  When I saw one prisoner,weak from underfeeding, cut with switches until he died in thepresence of a Berlin captain, my mind was made up.  My country hasgone too far in making the army officer supreme.  I now could seethe full significance of Zabern, a significance which I could notrealise at the time.  During the first part of the war I becameangry when outsiders called us barbarians; now I feel sad.  I donot blame them.  But it is our system that is at fault, and we mustcorrect it.  Therefore, although I am an insignificant individualand do not count, I shall, as I love my country, obey the dictatesof my conscience.  I will not be an officer in the German system."I thought of that sincere young student while the boat staggeredunder the onslaughts of heavy seas, and the corporal told of howtwelve hours' daily toil on the railway in Courland with rationsentirely inadequate for such work, finally put him on the sicklist, and he was sent back to Munster in western Germany.He was then sent into the fields with two companions--the two whowere in the group about the table--and with them he seized afavourable opportunity to escape.  His companions had tried onprevious occasions, each separately, but had been caught, sent backand put into dark cells and given only one meal a day for a longand weakening period.  That did not daunt them.  The Germansthought that men who had gone through that kind of punishment wouldnot try to escape again.  Yet as soon as their strength wasrestored through their food parcels from home they were off, but inan entirely different direction.I asked one of them, a little Welshman, where be got the waterproofrubber bag on the floor at his feet, in which were all his earthlybelongings.  "That used to be the old German farmer's tablecloth,"he said.To-day in Europe there are millions of civilians dressed inmilitary uniform, which fails to hide the fact that their main workof life is not that of the soldier.  But the three British soldierssitting under the smoky brass lamp were of a different sort.Twelve years of service had so indelibly stamped them as soldiersof the King that the make-shift clothing given them in Holland,could not conceal their calling.  Their faces were an unnaturalwhite from the terrible experiences which they had undergone, but,like the rest of the Old Army, they were always soldiers, everyinch of them.The two men whom, I had heard talking French on the deck wereBelgians.  The one had been a soldier at Liege, and had managed toscramble across a ditch after his three days' tramp to Holland,although the sentry's bullet whistled uncomfortably close.  He saidthat his strongest wish was to rejoin the Belgian army so that hemight do his part to avenge the death of seven civilian hostageswho had been shot before his eyes.The other Belgian was just over military age, but he wanted toreach England to volunteer.  His nerve and resource are certainlyall right.  He knew of the electrified wire along the Belgian-Dutchfrontier, so he brought two pieces of glass with him, and thus heldthe current of death away from his body while he wriggled throughto freedom.We talked until after midnight.  The French captain, formerly aninstructor of artillery at Saint Cyr--the West Point and theSandhurst of France--taken prisoner in the first autumn of the war,was the last to tell his story.At Torgau, Saxony, in the heart of Germany, be plunged into theElbe in the darkness of night, stemmed the swift waters, and onlanding, half-drowned, rose speedily and walked fast to avoid afatal chill.For twenty-nine days he struggled on towards liberty.  Nothing butthe tremendous impulse of the desire for freedom could have carriedhim on his own two feet across Germany, without money, throughcountless closely-policed villages and great cities, in a countrywhere everyone carries an identity book (with which, of course, hewas unprovided), without a friend or accomplice at any point of thejourney, with only a map torn from a railway time-table, and noother guides than the sun, moon, and stars and direction posts.  Iwill give the rest of the man's story in his own words."I came to the conclusion that my brain would not stand thecaptivity.  I knew some of the difficulties before me, but I doubtwhether I would have started if I had known them all.  I lived onunthreshed wheat and rye, apples, blackberries, bilberries,carrots, turnips and even raw potatoes.  I did not taste one morselof cooked food or anything stronger than water till I arrived inHolland.  I did not speak one word to any human being.  On twooccasions I marched more than thirty miles in the twenty-fourhours.  I slept always away from the roadside, and very often byday, and as far as possible from any inhabited house.  I am, as yousee, weak and thin, practically only muscle and bone, and duringthe last three days, while waiting in Holland for the boat, I havehad to eat carefully to avoid the illness that would almostcertainly follow repletion."After I had lain down for a few hours' sleep, I thought, as I hadoften thought during the past thirty months, that although this isa war of machinery there is plenty of the human element in it, too.People who tell only of the grim-drab aspect of the great strugglesometimes forget that romances just as fine as were ever spun byVictor Hugo happen around, them every day.At dawn I hung to the rail of the wildly tossing ship, looking atthe horizon from which the mists were clearing.  Two specks beganto grow into the long low black lines of destroyers.  Our mostanxious moment of the voyage had come.  We waited for the shot thatwould show them to be German."They're all right.  They're the escort!" came a voice on the windsthat swept over the bridge.They grew rapidly large, lashed the sea white as they tore alongone on each side of us, diving through the waves when they couldnot ride them.  When abreast of us they seemed almost to stop intheir own length, wheel and disappear in the distance.  Somehow theway they wheeled reminded me of the way the Cossacks used to pulltheir horses sharply at right angles when I saw them covering therearguard in the retreat through the Bukovina.The rough soldier at my side looked after them, with a mist in hiseyes that did not come from the sea.  "I'll be able to see my wifeagain," he said, more to the waves than to me.  "I didn't write,because I didn't want to raise any false hopes.  But this settlesit, we're certain to get home safe now.  I suppose I'll walk in andfind her packing my food parcel for Germany--the parcel that keptme alive, while some of them poor Russian chaps with nobody to sendthem parcels are going under every day."We ran close to two masts sticking up out of the water near themouth of the Humber, the mast of our sister ship, which had gonedown with all on board when she struck a mine.That is the sort of sight which makes some critics say, "What isthe matter with the British Navy?" Those critics forget to praisethe mine-sweepers that we saw all about, whose bravery, enduranceand noble spirit of self-sacrifice lead them to persevere in theirperilous work and enable a thousand ships to reach port to one thatgoes down.On that rough voyage across the North Sea, through the destroyerand armed motor launch patrol, maintained by men who workunflinchingly in the shadow of death, I felt once again the powerof the British Navy.  I cast my lot with that Navy when I leftHolland.  I know what its protection means, for I could not havecrossed on a neutral Dutch vessel.It is all very well to complain about a few raiders that manage inthirty months to pierce the British patrols, or the hurried dash ofswift destroyers into the Channel, but when you look from the whitechalk cliffs of the Kentish coast at hundreds of vessels passingsafely off the Downs, when you sail the Atlantic and theMediterranean and see only neutral and Allied ships carrying oncommerce, when you cross the Rhine and stand in food lines hourafter hour and day after day, where men and women who gloried inwar now whine at the hardships it brings, when you see a mightynation disintegrating in the shadow of starvation, and then pass toanother nation, which, though far less self-sustaining in food, hasplenty to eat, you simply have to realise that there are silentvictories which are often farther reaching than victories of_eclat_.CHAPTER XXVIIITHE LITTLE SHIPSI have been particularly impressed with two misconceptions whichhave existed, and to some extent still exist, not only in Germanybut in neutral countries.  The first is that England lacksvirility, is degenerate, has had her day of greatness; the second,that in the present war she is continuing what is alleged to havebeen her policy in the past, namely, pulling the strings andreaping the benefit while other nations do the fighting.  Throughpersonal investigation I find these contentions so thoroughlyrefuted that to develop the point would be to commence another bookinstead of finishing this one.As I write I can look from my desk in the Alexandra Hotel,Bridlington, on to the North Sea where it washes the "FrightfulnessCoast," for Bridlington lies between Hull and Scarborough.I see trawlers fishing and mine-sweeping whenever I raise my eyesfrom my writing.  Their crews know that they work in the shadow ofdeath in what they describe in the dock-side taverns as thegreatest sport in the world.  Praise of the big ships often causesus to forget the little ships.  I admire the one and reverence theother.  For if the men on the humbler craft could be intimidated,the doctrine of Frightfulness would be justified by victory.Intimidation is a favourite weapon of the people across the Rhine.I was among them when their airmen dropped bombs on Paris early inthe war.  "It is really humane," they said, "for it will frightenthe civilian population into imploring the military to yield to usto save them."  They thought the same of Zeppelin raids overEngland.  Intimidation was their guiding star in Belgium.  Thefirst I heard of the massacre of Louvain was from one of itsperpetrators.Intimidation was again their weapon in the case of Captain Fryatt."We planned it well," snarled a member of the Reichstag, incensedover my expression of disapproval, "Before we sent our ships tointercept the _Brussels_ we determined to capture him, try himquickly and execute him.  Since our submarines will win the war wemust protect them by all passible means.  You see, when the nextBritish captain thinks of ramming one of our submarines he willremember the fate of Captain Fryatt and think twice!"Once more Germany is attempting intimidation, and seeking to makeneutrals her ally in an attempt to starve Britain into defeat.  TheAmerican Ambassador is leaving Berlin, hundreds of neutral vesselshug havens of safety all over the world, but the women in Grimsbyand Hull still wave farewell to the little trawlers that slip downthe Humber to grapple with death.  Freighters, mine-sweepers,trawlers, and the rest of the unsung tollers of the sea continuetheir silent, all-important task.  They know that for them Germanyhas declared the law off, that they will be slaughtered at sight.They know also that despite the Grand Fleet and the armies inFrance, the Allies and their cause will go down in complete defeatif Germany succeeds in blocking the routes of commerce.  Theinsurmountable obstacle in her path is the simple, old-fashioneddogged courage of the average British seaman.The Germans have developed to an astounding degree the quality ofincorrectly diagnosing other peoples, due partly to the unboundedconceit engendered by their three wars of unification and theirrapid increase of prosperity.  Their mental food in recent yearshas been war, conquest, disparagement of others and glorificationof self.  They entered the struggle thinking only in army corps andsiege artillery.   Certain undefinable moral qualities, such as thelast-ditch spirit of the old British Army on the Yser, did not comewithin their scope of reckoning.British illusions of the early part of the war are gone.  Theaverage Briton fully appreciates Germany's gigantic strength, andhe coldly realises that as conditions are at present, his countrymust supply most of the driving force--men, guns, and shells--tobreak it.  He thinks of the awful cost in life, and the thoughtmakes him serious, but he is ready for any sacrifice.  He welcomeshelp from Allies and neutrals, but whether the help be great orsmall, he is willing and resolved to stand on his own feet, andcarry on to the end.  It is this spirit which makes Britainmagnificent to-day.When losses are brought home to the Germans they generally givevent to their feelings by hurling maledictions upon their enemies.The Briton, under similar circumstances, is usually remarkablyquiet, but, unlike the German, he is _individually_ moredetermined, in consequence of the loss, to see the thing through.Somehow the German always made me feel that his war determinationhad been organised for him.Organisation is the glory and the curse of Germany.  The Germansare by nature and training easily influenced, and as a mass theycan be led as readily in the right path as in the wrong.Common-sense administration and co-operation have made their citiesplaces of beauty, health, comfort and pleasure.  But when you stopfor a moment in your admiration of the streets, buildings, statues,bridges, in such a city as Munich and enter a crowded hall to sitamong people who listen with attention, obedience and delight to aprofessor venomously instructing them in their duty of "hating withthe whole heart and the whole mind," and convincing them that "onlythrough hate can the greatest obstacles be overcome," you begin tosuspect that something is wrong.It is part of the Prussian nature to push everything to extremes, atrait which has advantages and disadvantages.  It has resulted inbrilliant achievements in chemical and physical laboratories, andin gout, dyspepsia and flabbiness in eating establishments.  Avirtue carried too far becomes a vice.  In Germany patriotismbecomes jingoistic hatred and contempt for others, organisationbecomes the utilisation of servility, obedience becomes willingnessto do wrong at command.Americans and British are inclined to ascribe to the Germans theirown qualities.  In nothing is this more obvious than in the Englishidea that the fair treatment of Germans in England, will beget fairtreatment of the English in Germany.  The Prussians, who have manyOriental characteristics--and some of them, a good deal of Orientalappearance--think orientally and attribute fair, or what we callsportsmanlike, treatment to fright and a desire to curry favour.When Maubeuge fell I heard Germans of all classes boast of howtheir soldiers struck the British who offered to shake hands afterthey surrendered to the Germans.  Nearly two years later, duringthe Battle of the Somme, some Berlin papers copied from Londonpapers a report of how British soldiers presented arms to the groupof prisoners who had stubbornly defended Ovillers.  I called theattention of several German acquaintances to this as an evidence ofAnglo-Saxon sporting spirit, but I got practically the sameresponse in every case.  "Yes, they are beginning at last to seewhat we can do!" was the angry remark.The Germans have become more and more "Prussianised" in recentyears.  State worship had advanced so far that the German peopleentered the conflict in the perverted belief that the GermanGovernment had used every means to avert war.  It is a mistake,however, to suppose that the German people entered the warreluctantly.  They did not.  There was perfect unity in the joyfulthought of German invincibility, easy and complete victory, plentyof plunder, and such huge indemnities that the growing burden oftaxation would be thrown off their shoulders.A country where the innocent children are scientifically inoculatedwith the virus of hate, where force, and only force, is held to bethe determinant internationally of mine and thine, where the moralsof the farmyard, are preached from the professorial chair in orderto manufacture human cogs for the machine of militarism, is anundesirable and a dangerous neighbour and will continue so until itaccepts other standards.  A victorious Germany would not acceptother standards.That is why I look on the little ships with so much admiration thismorning.  They sail between Germany and victory, for if they couldbe intimidated Britain would be starved out.  Then the gospel that"only through hate can the greatest obstacles be overcome," wouldbe the corner-stone of the most powerful Empire of history.End of Project Gutenberg's The Land of Deepening Shadow, by D.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELLONLY AN IRISH BOYCHAPTER IANDY BURKE"John, saddle my horse, and bring him around to the door."The speaker was a boy of fifteen, handsomely dressed, and, to judgefrom his air and tone, a person of considerable consequence, in hisown opinion, at least. The person addressed was employed in the stableof his father, Colonel Anthony Preston, and so inferior in socialcondition that Master Godfrey always addressed him in imperious tones.John looked up and answered, respectfully:"Master Godfrey, your horse is sick of the disease, and your fatherleft orders that he wasn't to go out on no account.""It's my horse," said Godfrey; "I intend to take him out.""Maybe it's yours, but your father paid for him.""None of your impudence, John," answered Godfrey, angrily. "Am Imaster, or are you, I should like to know!""Neither, I'm thinking," said John, with a twinkle in his eye. "It'syour father that's the master.""I'm master of the horse, anyway, so saddle him at once.""The colonel would blame me," objected John."If you don't, I'll report you and get you dismissed.""I'll take the risk, Master Godfrey," said the servant,good-humoredly. "The colonel won't be so unreasonable as to send meaway for obeying his own orders."Here John was right, and Godfrey knew it, and this vexed him the more.He had an inordinate opinion of himself and his own consequence, andfelt humiliated at being disobeyed by a servant, without being able topunish him for his audacity. This feeling was increased by thepresence of a third party, who was standing just outside the fence.As this third party is our hero, I must take a separate paragraph todescribe him. He was about the age of Godfrey, possibly a littleshorter and stouter. He had a freckled face, full of good humor, butat the same time resolute and determined. He appeared to be one whohad a will of his own, but not inclined to interfere with others,though ready to stand up for his own rights. In dress he compared veryunfavorably with the young aristocrat, who was biting his lips withvexation. In fact, though he is my hero, his dress was far fromheroic. He had no vest, and his coat was ragged, as well as his pants.He had on a pair of shoes two or three times too large for him. Theyhad not been made to order, but had been given him by a gentleman ofnearly double his size, and fitted him too much. He wore a straw hat,for it was summer, but the brim was semi-detached, and a part of hisbrown hair found its way through it.Now Godfrey was just in the mood for picking a quarrel with somebody,and as there was no excuse for quarreling any further with John, hewas rather glad to pitch into the young stranger."Who are you?" he demanded, in his usual imperious tone, and with acontraction of the brow."Only an Irish boy!" answered the other, with a droll look and aslight brogue."Then what business have you leaning against my fence?" again demandedGodfrey, imperiously."Shure, I didn't know it was your fence.""Then you know now. Quit leaning against it.""Why should I, now? I don't hurt it, do I?""No matter--I told you to go away. We don't want any beggars here.""Shure, I don't see any," said the other boy, demurely."What are you but a beggar?""Shure, I'm a gintleman of indepindent fortune.""You look like it," said Godfrey, disdainfully. "Where do you keepit?""Here!" said the Irish boy, tapping a bundle which he carried over hisshoulder, wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief, with a stick thrustthrough beneath the knot."What's your name?""Andy Burke. What's yours?""I don't feel under any obligations to answer your questions," saidGodfrey, haughtily."Don't you? Then what made you ask me?""That's different. You are only an Irish boy.""And who are you?""I am the only son of Colonel Anthony Preston," returned Godfrey,impressively."Are you, now? I thought you was a royal duke, or maybe QueenVictoria's oldest boy.""Fellow, you are becoming impertinent.""Faith, I didn't mean it. You look so proud and gintale that it's jista mistake I made.""You knew that we had no dukes in America," said Godfrey,suspiciously."If we had, now, you'd be one of them," said Andy."Why? What makes you say so?""You're jist the picture of the Earl of Barleycorn's ildest son that Isaw before I left Ireland."Godfrey possessed so large a share of ridiculous pride that he feltpleased with the compliment, though he was not clear about itssincerity."Where do you live?" he asked, with a slight lowering of his tone."Where do I live? Shure, I don't live anywhere now, but I'm going tolive in the village. My mother came here a month ago.""Why didn't you come with her?""I was workin' with a farmer, but the work gave out and I came home.Maybe I'll find work here.""I think I know where your mother lives," said John, who had heard theconversation. "She lives up the road a mile or so, in a little housewith two rooms. It's where old Jake Barlow used to live.""Thank you, sir. I guess I'll be goin', then, as my mother'll beexpectin' me. Do you know if she's well?" and a look of anxiety cameover the boy's honest, good-natured face.The question was addressed to John, but of this Godfrey was not quitesure. He thought the inquiry was made of him, and his pride wastouched."What should I know of your mother, you beggar?" he said, with asneer. "I don't associate with such low people.""Do you mane my mother?" said Andy, quickly, and he, too, looked angryand threatening."Yes, I do. What are you going to do about it?" demanded Godfrey."You'd better take it back," said Andy, his good-humored face now darkwith passion."Do you think I am afraid of such a beggar as you?" sneered Godfrey."You appear to forget that you are speaking to a gentleman.""Shure, I didn't know it," returned Andy, hotly. "You're no gentlemanif you insult my mother, and if you'll come out here for a minute I'llgive you a bating.""John," said Godfrey, angrily, "will you drive that beggar away?"Now, John's sympathies were rather with Andy than with his youngmaster. He had no great admiration for Godfrey, having witnessedduring the year he had been in his father's employ too much of theboy's arrogance and selfishness to feel much attachment for him. Hadhe taken any part in the present quarrel, he would have preferredespousing the cause of the Irish boy; but that would not have beenpolite, and he therefore determined to preserve his neutrality."That ain't my business, Master Godfrey," he said. "You must fightyour own battles.""Go away from here," said Godfrey, imperiously advancing toward thatpart of the fence against which Andy Burke was leaning."Will you take back what you said agin' my mother?""No, I won't.""Then you're a blackguard, if you are a rich man's son."The blood rushed to Godfrey's face on the instant. This was a palpableinsult. What! he, a rich man's son, the only son and heir of ColonelAnthony Preston, with his broad acres and ample bank account--he to becalled a blackguard by a low Irish boy. His passion got the better ofhim, and he ran through the gate, his eyes flashing fire, bent onexterminating his impudent adversary.CHAPTER IIA SKIRMISHAndy Burke was not the boy to run away from an opponent of his ownsize and age. Neither did he propose to submit quietly to thethrashing which Godfrey designed to give him. He dropped his stick andbundle, and squared off scientifically at his aristocratic foe.Godfrey paused an instant before him."I'm going to give you a thrashing," he said; "the worst thrashing youever had.""Are you, now?" asked Andy, undismayed. "Come on, thin; I'm ready foryou.""You're an impudent young ruffian.""So are you."Godfrey's aristocratic blood boiled at this retort, and he struck outat Andy, but the latter knew what was coming, and, swift as a flash,warded it off, and fetched Godfrey a blow full upon his nose, whichstarted the blood. Now, the pain and the sight of the blood combinedfilled him with added fury, and he attempted to seize Andy around thewaist and throw him. But here again he was foiled. The young Irish boyevaded his grasp, and, seizing him in turn, by an adroit movement ofthe foot, tripped him up. Godfrey fell heavily on his back.Andy withdrew a little, and did not offer to hold him down, as Godfreywould have been sure to do under similar circumstances. "Have you gotenough?" he asked."That wasn't fair," exclaimed Godfrey, jumping up hastily, deeplymortified because he had been worsted in the presence of John, who,sooth to say, rather enjoyed his young master's overthrow.He rushed impetuously at Andy, but he was blinded by his ownimpetuosity, and his adversary, who kept cool and self-possessed, had,of course, the advantage. So the engagement terminated asbefore--Godfrey was stretched once more on the sidewalk. He was aboutto renew the assault, however, when there was an interruption. Thisinterruption came in the form of Colonel Preston himself, who wasreturning from a business meeting of citizens interested inestablishing a savings bank in the village."What's all this, Godfrey?" he called out, in a commanding tone.Godfrey knew that when his father spoke he must obey, and he thereforedesisted from the contemplated attack. He looked up at his father andsaid, sulkily:"I was punishing this Irish boy for his impertinence."John grinned a little at this way of putting it, and his father said:"It looked very much as if he were punishing you.""I didn't get fair hold," said Godfrey, sulkily."So he was impertinent, was he? What did he say?""He said I was no gentleman."Andy Burke listened attentively to what was said, but didn't attemptto justify himself as yet."I have sometimes had suspicions of that myself," said his father,quietly.Though Godfrey was an only son, his father was sensible enough to befully aware of his faults. If he was indulged, it was his mother, nothis father, that was in fault. Colonel Preston was a fair and justman, and had sensible views about home discipline; but he wasoverruled by his wife, whose character may be judged from the factthat her son closely resembled her. She was vain, haughty, and proudof putting on airs. She considered herself quite the finest lady inthe village, but condescended to associate with the wives of theminister, the doctor, and a few of the richer inhabitants, but evenwith them she took care to show that she regarded herself superior tothem all. She was, therefore, unpopular, as was her son among hiscompanions. However, these two stood by each other, and Mrs. Prestonwas sure to defend Godfrey in all he did, and complained because hisfather did not do the same."I didn't think you'd turn against me, and let a low boy insult me,"complained Godfrey."Why do you call him low?""Because he's only an Irish boy.""Some of our most distinguished men have been Irish boys or of Irishdescent. I don't think you have proved your point.""He's a beggar.""I'm not a beggar," exclaimed Andy, speaking for the first time. "Inever begged a penny in all my life.""Look at his rags," said Godfrey, scornfully."You would be in rags, too, if you had to buy your own clothes. Ithink I should respect you very much more under the circumstances,"returned his father."The colonel's a-givin' it to him," thought John, with a grin."'Twon't do the young master any harm.""What is your name?" inquired Colonel Preston, turning now to ourhero, as his son seemed to have no more to say."Andy Burke.""Do you live here?""I've just come to town, sir. My mother lives here.""Where does she live?""I don't know, sir, just. He knows," pointing out John."I calcerlate his mother lives in old Jake Barlow's house," said John."Oh, the Widow Burke. Yes, I know. I believe Mrs. Preston employs hersometimes. Well, Andy, if that's your name, how is it that I catch youfighting with my son? That is not very creditable, unless you havegood cause.""He called my mother a low woman," said Andy, "and then he run up andhit me.""Did you do that, Godfrey?""He was putting on too many airs. He talked as if he was my equal.""He appears to be more than your equal in strength," said his father."Well, was that all?""It was about all.""Then I think he did perfectly right, and I hope you'll profit by thelesson you have received.""He is a gentleman," thought Andy. "He ain't hard on a boy becausehe's poor."Colonel Preston went into the house, but Godfrey lingered behind amoment. He wanted to have a parting shot at his adversary. He couldfight with words, if not with blows."Look here!" he said, imperiously; "don't let me see you round hereagain.""Why not?""I don't want to see you.""Then you can look the other way," said Andy, independently."This is my house.""I thought it was your father's.""That's the same thing. You'd better stay at home with your mother.""Thank you," said Andy; "you're very kind. May I come along the roadsometimes?""If you do, walk on the other side."Andy laughed. He was no longer provoked, but amused."Then, by the same token, you'd better not come by my mother's house,"he said, good-humoredly."I don't want to come near your miserable shanty," said Godfrey,disdainfully."You may come, if you keep on the other side of the road," said Andy,slyly.Godfrey was getting disgusted; for in the war of words, as well as ofblows, his ragged opponent seemed to be getting the better of him. Heturned on his heel and entered the house. He was sure of one who wouldsympathize with him in his dislike and contempt for Andy--this was, ofcourse, his mother. Besides, he had another idea. He knew that Mrs.Burke had been employed by his mother, occasionally, to assist in thehouse. It occurred to him that it would be a fine piece of revenge toinduce her to dispense hereafter with the poor woman's services. Benton accomplishing this creditable retaliation, he left his youngopponent master of the field."I must be goin'," said Andy, as he picked up his bundle and suspendedit from his stick. "Will I find the house where my mother lives,easy?"The question was, of course, addressed to John, who had just turned togo to the stable."You can't miss it," answered John. "It's a mile up the road, stands alittle way back. There's a few hills of potatoes in the front yard.How long since you saw your mother?""It's three months.""Does she know you are coming to-day?""No. I would have wrote to her, but my fingers isn't very ready withthe pen.""Nor mine either," said John. "I'd rather take a licking any time thanwrite a letter. Come round and see us some time.""The boy'll lick me," said Andy, laughing."I guess you can manage him."Andy smiled, for it was his own conviction, also. With his bundle onhis shoulder he trudged on, light of heart, for he was about to seehis mother and sister, both of whom he warmly loved.CHAPTER IIIANDY AND HIS MOTHERThe house in which the Widow Burke and her daughter lived was a veryhumble one. It had not been painted for many years, and the originalcoat had worn off, leaving it dark and time-stained. But when Mrs.Burke came to town, a short time before, it was the only dwelling shecould hire that was held at a rent within her means. So she and Mary,who was now eleven years old, had moved in their scanty furniture andmade it look as much like a home as possible.Mrs. Burke had not always been as poor as now. She was the daughter ofan Irish tradesman, and had received quite a good education. In duetime she married a small farmer, who was considered to be in faircircumstances, but there came a bad year, and misfortunes of variouskinds came together. The last and heaviest of all was fever, whichprostrated her husband on a bed of sickness. Though his wife watchedover him night and day with all the devotion of love, it was all of noavail. He died, and she found herself left with about a hundredpounds--after his debts were paid. She was advised to go to Americawith her two children, and did so. That was five years before. Theyhad lived in various places--but the little sum she had left over,after the passage of the three was paid, had long since melted away,and she was forced to get a living as she could.Since she had come to Crampton, leaving Andy at work for a farmer inthe place where they had last lived, she had obtained what sewing shecould from the families in the village, and had besides obtained achance to help about the ironing at Colonel Preston's. Washing was toohard for her, for her strength was not great.At the time of our introduction she was engaged in making a shirt, oneof half a dozen which she had engaged to make for Dr. Plympton, thevillage doctor. She had no idea that Andy was so near, having heardnothing of his having left his place, but it was of him she wasspeaking."I wish I could see Andy," she sighed, looking up from her work."So do I, mother.""The sight of him would do my eyes good, he's such a lively lad, Andyis--always in good spirits.""Shure, he's got a good heart, mother dear. It wouldn't be so lonelylike if he was here.""I would send for him if there was anything to do, Mary; but we are sopoor that we must all of us stay where we can get work.""When do you go to Colonel Preston's, mother? Is it to-morrow?""Yes, my dear.""I'm always lonely when you are away.""Perhaps you would come with me, Mary, dear. Mrs. Preston wouldn'tobject, I'm thinkin'.""If Andy was at home I wouldn't feel so lonely."While she was speaking Andy himself had crept under the window, andheard her words. He was planning a surprise, but waited for the lastmoment to announce himself. He waited to hear what reply his motherwould say."I think we'll see him soon, Mary, dear.""What makes you say so, mother?""I don't know. I've got a feeling in my bones that we'll soon meet.The blessed saints grant that it may be so.""Your bones are right this time, mother," said a merry voice.And Andy, popping up from his stooping position, showed himself at thewindow.There was a simultaneous scream from Mary and her mother."Is it you, Andy?" exclaimed Mary."It isn't nobody else," said Andy, rather ungrammatically."Come in, Andy, my darling--come in, and tell me if you are well,"said his mother, dropping the shirt on which she was at work, andrising to her feet."I'll be with you in a jiffy," said Andy.And, with a light leap, he cleared the window sill, and stood in thepresence of his mother and sister, who vied with each other in huggingthe returned prodigal."You'll choke me, Sister Mary," said Andy, good-humoredly. "Maybe youthink I'm your beau.""Don't speak to her of beaux, and she only eleven years old," said hismother. "But you haven't told us why you came.""Faith, mother, it was because the work gave out, and I thought I'dpack my trunk and come and see you and Mary. That's all.""We are glad to see you, Andy, dear, but," continued his mother,taking a survey of her son's appearance for the first time, "you'relookin' like a beggar, with your clothes all in rags."Andy laughed."Faith, it's about so, mother. There was no one to mend 'em for me,and I'm more used to the hoe than the needle.""I will sew up some of the holes when you're gone to bed, Andy. Areyou sure you're well, lad?""Well, mother? Jist wait till you see me atin', mother. You'll thinkI've got a healthy appetite.""I never thought, Andy. The poor lad must be hungry. Mary, see whatthere is in the closet.""There's nothing but some bread, mother," said Mary.Indeed bread and potatoes were the main living of the mother anddaughter, adopted because they were cheap. They seldom ventured on theextravagance of meat, and that was one reason, doubtless, for Mrs.Burke's want of strength and sometimes feeling faint and dizzy whileworking at her needle."Is there no meat in the house, Mary?""Not a bit, mother.""Then go and see if there's an egg outside."The widow kept a few hens, having a henhouse in one corner of the backyard. The eggs she usually sold, but Andy was at home now, and neededsomething hearty, so they must be more extravagant than usual.Mary went out, and quickly returned with a couple of eggs."Here they are, mother, two of them. The black hen was settin' onthem, but I drove her away, and you can hear her cackling. Shure, Andyneeds them more than she does.""Will you have them boiled or fried, Andy?" asked his mother."Any way, mother. I'm hungry enough to ate 'em raw. It's hungry workwalkin' ten miles wid a bundle on your back, let alone the fightin'.""Fighting!" exclaimed Mrs. Burke, pausing in drawing out the table."Fightin', Andy?" chimed in Mary, in chorus."Yes, mother," said Andy."And who did you fight with?" asked the widow, anxiously."With a boy that feels as big as a king; maybe bigger.""What's his name?""I heard his father call him Godfrey.""What, Godfrey Preston?" exclaimed Mrs. Burke in something likeconsternation."Yes, that's the name. He lives in a big house a mile up the road.""What made you fight with him, Andy?" inquired his mother, anxiously."He began it.""What could he have against you? He didn't know you.""He thought as I only was an Irish boy he could insult me, and call menames, but I was too much for him.""I hope you didn't hurt him?""I throwed him twice, mother, but then his father came up and that puta stop to the fight.""And what did his father say?""He took my part, mother, when he found out how it was, and scoldedhis son. Shure, he's a gentleman.""Yes, Colonel Preston is a gentleman.""And that's where he isn't like his son, I'm thinkin'.""No. Godfrey isn't like his father. It's his mother he favors.""Faith, and I don't call it favoring," said Andy. Is the old lady asugly and big-feelin' as the son?""She's rather a hard woman, Andy. I go up to work there one day everyweek.""Do you, mother?" said Andy, not wholly pleased to hear that hismother was employed by the mother of his young enemy."Yes, Andy.""What is it you do?""I help about the ironing. To-morrow's my day for going there.""I wish you could stay at home, and not go out to work, mother," saidAndy, soberly. "You don't look strong, mother, dear. I'm afraid you'renot well.""Oh, yes, Andy, I am quite well. I shall be better, too, now that youare at home. I missed you very much. It seemed lonely without you.""I must find out some way to earn money, mother," said Andy. "I'myoung and strong, and I ought to support you.""You can help me, Andy," said Mrs. Burke, cheerfully.She took up the shirt and resumed her sewing."I'm afraid you're too steady at the work, mother," said Andy."I shall be ironing to-morrow. It's a change from sewing, Andy. Mary,it's time to take off the eggs."Andy was soon partaking of the frugal meal set before him. He enjoyedit, simple as it was, and left not a particle of the egg or a crumb ofthe bread.CHAPTER IVMRS. PRESTONWhenever Godfrey Preston had any difficulty with his father, he alwayswent to his mother, and from her, right or wrong, he was sure toobtain sympathy. So in the present instance, failing to receive fromhis father that moral support to which he deemed himself entitled, onentering the house he sought out his mother.Mrs. Preston, who was rather a spare lady, with thin lips and a sharp,hatchet-like face, was in her own room. She looked up as Godfreyentered."Well, Godfrey, what's the matter?" she asked, seeing on her son'sface an unmistakable expression of discontent."Matter enough, mother. Father's always against me.""I know it. He appears to forget that you are his son. What is itnow?""He came up just as I was thrashing a boy down in the yard.""What boy?""Nobody you know, mother. It was only an Irish boy.""What was your reason for punishing him?" asked Mrs. Preston, adoptingGodfrey's version of the affair."He was impudent to me. He was leaning against the fence, and Iordered him away. He was a ragged boy, with a bundle on a stick. Ofcourse, when he wouldn't move, I went out and thrashed him.""Was your father there?""He came up in the midst of it, and, instead of taking my part, hetook the part of the Irish boy.""I don't see how Mr. Preston can be so unfair," said his wife. "It ishis duty to stand by his family.""I felt ashamed to have him scold me before the impudent boy. Ofcourse, he enjoyed it, and I suppose he will think he can be impudentto me again.""No doubt. I will speak to your father about it. He really shouldn'tbe so inconsiderate. But what is that stain on your coat, Godfrey? Ishould think you had been down on your back on the ground.""Oh," said Godfrey, rather embarrassed, "I happened to slip as I waswrestling with the fellow, and fell on my back. However, I was upagain directly and gave it to him, I can tell you. If father hadn'tstopped me I'd have laid him out," he continued, in a swaggering tone.It will be seen that Godfrey did not always confine himself to thetruth. Indeed, he found it rather hard at all times to admit eitherthat he had been in the wrong or had been worsted. Even if his mothersometimes suspected that his accounts were a trifle distorted, sheforbore to question their accuracy. Mother and son had a sort of tacitcompact by which they stood by each other, and made common causeagainst Colonel Preston."Don't you know the boy? Doesn't he live in the neighborhood?" askedMrs. Preston, after a pause."He's just come into the town, but I'll tell you who he is. He's theson of that woman that comes to work for you once a week.""Mrs. Burke?""Yes; he told me that his name was Andy Burke.""He ought to know his place too well to be impudent to one in yourposition.""So I think.""I shall speak to Mrs. Burke about her son's bad behavior.""I wish you'd discharge her. That's a good way to punish the boy.""I shouldn't object to doing that, Godfrey, but Mrs. Burke is acapital hand at ironing shirts. Yours and your father's never lookedso nice as they have since she has been here."Godfrey looked a little discontented. Being essentially mean, hethought it would be an excellent plan to strike the son through themother."You might threaten her, mother, a little. Tell her to make her boybehave himself, or you'll discharge her.""I will certainly speak to her on the subject, Godfrey."At the table Mrs. Preston introduced the subject of Godfrey's wrongs."I am surprised, Mr. Preston, that you took part against Godfrey whenhe was rudely assaulted this morning.""I thought Godfrey in the wrong, my dear. That was my reason.""You generally appear to think your own son in the wrong. You areready to take part with any stranger against him," said Mrs. Preston,in a complaining manner."I don't think you are quite right just there," said her husband,good-humoredly. "I must say, however, that Godfrey generally is in thewrong.""You are very unjust to him.""I don't mean to be. I would be glad to praise him, but he is sooverbearing to those whom he considers his inferiors, that I amfrequently ashamed of his manner of treating others.""The boy has some reason to feel proud. He must maintain hisposition.""What is his position?""I don't think you need to ask. As our son he is entitled to a degreeof consideration.""He will receive consideration enough if he deserves it, but this is arepublic, and all are supposed to be on an equality."Mrs. Preston tossed her head."That's well enough to say, but don't you consider yourself above aman that goes round sawing wood for a living?""At any rate I would treat him with courtesy. Because I am richer, andhave a better education, it is no reason why I should treat him withcontempt.""Then I don't share your sentiments," said Mrs. Preston. "I amthankful that I know my position better. I mean to uphold the dignityof the family, and I hope my son will do the same."Colonel Preston shrugged his shoulders as his wife swept from theroom. He knew of old her sentiments on this subject, and he was awarethat she was not likely to become a convert to his more democraticideas."I am afraid she will spoil Godfrey," he thought. "The boy is gettingintolerable. I am glad this Irish boy gave him a lesson. He seems afine-spirited lad. I will help him if I can.""Ellen," said Mrs. Preston the next morning, "when Mrs. Burke comeslet me know.""Yes, ma'am.""She's come," announced Ellen, half an hour later.Mrs. Preston rose from her seat and went into the laundry."Good-morning, Mrs. Preston," said Mrs. Burke."Good-morning," returned the other, stiffly. "Mrs. Burke, I hear thatyour son behaved very badly to my Godfrey yesterday.""It isn't like Andy, ma'am," said the mother, quietly. "He's a good,well-behaved lad.""Godfrey tells me that he made a brutal assault upon him, quiteforgetting his superior position.""Are you sure Master Godfrey didn't strike him first?" asked themother."Even if he had, your son shouldn't have struck back.""Why not?" asked Mrs. Burke, her eyes flashing with spirit, meek asshe generally was."Because it was improper," said Mrs. Preston, decisively."I don't see that, ma'am. Andy isn't the boy to stand still and bestruck.""Do I understand," said Mrs. Preston, in a freezing tone, "that youuphold your son in his atrocious conduct?""Yes, ma'am. I stand up for Andy, for he's a good boy, and if hestruck Master Godfrey it was because he was struck first.""That is enough," said Mrs. Preston, angrily. "I shall not requireyour services after to-day, Mrs. Burke.""Just as you like, ma'am," said Mrs. Burke, with quiet pride, but shethought, with a sinking heart, of the gap which this would make in herscanty income.CHAPTER VA PROFITABLE JOBAfter finishing her work at Colonel Preston's Mrs. Burke went home.She did not see Mrs. Preston again, for the latter sent her the moneyfor her services by Ellen."Mrs. Preston says you're not to come next week," said Ellen."She told me so herself this morning. She is angry because I took thepart of my boy against Master Godfrey.""Godfrey's the hatefulest boy I ever see," said Ellen, whose grammarwas a little defective. "He's always putting on airs.""He struck my Andy, and Andy struck him back.""I'm glad he did," said Ellen, emphatically. "I hope he'll do itagain.""I don't want the boys to fight. Andy's a peaceable lad; and he'll bequiet if he's let alone. But he's just like his poor father, and hewon't let anybody trample on him.""That's where he's right," said Ellen. "I'm sorry you're not comingagain, Mrs. Burke.""So am I, Ellen, for I need the money, but I'll stand by my boy.""You iron real beautiful. I've heard Mrs. Preston say so often. Shewon't get nobody that'll suit her so well.""If you hear of anybody else that wants help, Ellen, will you sendthem to me?"This Ellen faithfully promised, and Mrs. Burke went home, sorry tohave lost her engagement, but not sorry to have stood up for Andy, ofwhom she was proud.Andy was at home when she returned. He had found enough to do at hometo occupy him so far. The next day he meant to go out in search ofemployment. When his mother got back she found him cutting some brushwhich he had obtained from the neighboring woods."There, mother," he said, pointing to a considerable pile, "you'llhave enough sticks to last you a good while.""Thank you, Andy, dear. That'll save Mary and me a good deal oftrouble."There was nothing in her words, but something in her tone, which ledAndy to ask:"What's the matter, mother? Has anything happened?""I've got through working for Mrs. Preston, Andy.""Got through? For to-day, you mean?""No; I'm not going to work there again.""Why not?""She complained of you, Andy.""What did she say, mother?" asked our hero, listening with attention."She said you ought not to have struck Godfrey.""Did you tell her he struck me first?""Yes, I did.""And what did she say, thin?""She said that you ought not to have struck him back.""And what did you say, mother?""I said my Andy wasn't the boy to stand still and let anybody beathim.""Good for you, mother! Bully for you! That's where you hit the nail onthe head. And what did the ould lady say then?""She told me I needn't come there again to work.""I'm glad you're not goin', mother. I don't want you to work for thelikes of her. Let her do her own ironin', the ould spalpeen!"In general, Andy's speech was tolerably clear of the brogue, butwhenever he became a little excited, as at present, it was moremarked. He was more angry at the slight to his mother than he wouldhave been at anything, however contemptuous, said to himself. He hadthat chivalrous feeling of respect for his mother which every boy ofhis age ought to have, more especially if that mother is a widow."But, Andy, I'm very sorry for the money I'll lose.""How much is it, mother?""Seventy-five cents.""I'll make it up, mother.""I know you will if you can, Andy; but work is hard to get, and thepay is small.""You might go back and tell Mrs. Preston that I'm a dirty spalpeen,and maybe she'd take you back, mother.""I wouldn't slander my own boy like that if she'd take me back twentytimes.""That's the way to talk, mother," said Andy, well pleased. "Don't yoube afeared--we'll get along somehow. More by token, here's threedollars I brought home with me yisterday."Andy pulled out from his pocket six silver half-dollars, and offeredthem to his mother."Where did you get them, Andy?" she asked, in surprise."Where did I get them? One way and another, by overwork. We won'tstarve while them last, will we?"Andy's cheerful tone had its effect upon his mother."Perhaps you're right, Andy," she said, smiling. "At any rate we won'tcry till it's time.""To-morrow I'll go out and see if I can find work.""Suppose you don't find it, Andy?" suggested his sister."Then I'll take in washing," said Andy, laughing. "It's an iligantwasher I'd make, wouldn't I now?""Nobody'd hire you more than once, Andy."By and by they had supper. If they had been alone they would have gotalong on bread and tea; but "Andy needs meat, for he's a growing boy,"said his mother.And so Mary was dispatched to the butcher's for a pound and a half ofbeefsteak, which made the meal considerably more attractive. Mrs.Burke felt that it was extravagant, particularly just as her incomewas diminished, but she couldn't bear to stint Andy. At first she wasnot going to eat, herself, meaning to save a part for Andy'sbreakfast; but our hero found her out, and declared he wouldn't eat abit if his mother did not eat, too. So she was forced to take hershare, and it did her good, for no one can keep up a decent share ofstrength on bread and tea alone.The next morning Andy went out in search of work. He had no verydefinite idea where to go, or to whom to apply, but he concluded toput in an application anywhere he could.He paused in front of the house of Deacon Jones, a hard-fisted oldfarmer, whose reputation for parsimony was well known throughout thevillage, but of this Andy, being a newcomer, was ignorant."Wouldn't you like to hire a good strong boy?" he asked, entering theyard.The deacon looked up."Ever worked on a farm?""Yes.""Can you milk?""Yes.""Where did you work?""In Carver.""What's your name?""Andy Burke.""Where do you live?""With my mother, Mrs. Burke, a little way down the road.""I know--the Widder Burke.""Have you got any work for me?""Wait a minute, I'll see."The deacon brought out an old scythe from the barn, and felt of theedge. There was not much danger in so doing, for it was as dull as ahoe."This scythe needs sharpening," he said. "Come and turn thegrindstone.""Well, here's a job, anyhow," thought Andy. "Wonder what he'll giveme."He sat down and began to turn the grindstone. The deacon bore onheavily, and this made it hard turning. His arms ached, and theperspiration stood on his brow. It was certainly pretty hard work, butthen he must be prepared for that, and after all he was earning moneyfor his mother. Still the time did seem long. The scythe was sointolerably dull that it took a long time to make any impression uponit."Kinder hard turnin', ain't it?" said the deacon."Yes," said Andy."This scythe ain't been sharpened for ever so long. It's as dull as ahoe."However, time and patience work wonders, and at length the deacon,after a careful inspection of the blade of the scythe, released Andyfrom his toil of an hour and a half, with the remark:"I reckon that'll do."He put the scythe in its place and came out.Andy lingered respectfully for the remuneration of his labor."He ought to give me a quarter," he thought. But the deacon showed nodisposition to pay him, and Andy became impatient."I guess I'll be goin'," he said."All right. I ain't got anything more for you to do," said the deacon."I'll take my pay now," said Andy, desperately."Pay? What for?" inquired the deacon, innocently."For turning the grindstone.""You don't mean ter say you expect anything for that?" said the deaconin a tone of surprise."Yes I do," said Andy. "I can't work an hour and a half for nothing.""I didn't expect to pay for such a trifle," said the old man, fumblingin his pocket.Finally he brought out two cents, one of the kind popularly known asbung-towns, which are not generally recognized as true currency."There," said he in an injured tone. "I'll pay you, though I didn'tthink you'd charge anything for any little help like that."Andy looked at the proffered compensation with mingled astonishmentand disgust."Never mind," he said. "You can keep it. You need it more'n I do, I'mthinkin'!""Don't you want it?" asked the deacon, surprised."No, I don't. I'm a poor boy, but I don't work an hour and a half fortwo cents, one of 'em bad. I'd rather take no pay at all.""That's a cur'us boy," said the deacon, slowly sliding the penniesback into his pocket. "I calc'late he expected more just for a littlejob like that. Does he think I'm made of money?"As Andy went out of the yard, the idea dawned upon the deacon that hehad saved two cents, and his face was luminous with satisfaction.CHAPTER VITHE TWO OLD MAIDS"He's the meanest man I ever saw," thought Andy. "Does he think I workon nothing a year, and find myself? Divil a bit of work will I do forhim agin, if I know it." But better luck was in store for Andy.Quarter of a mile farther on, in a two-story house, old-fashioned butneat, lived two maiden ladies of very uncertain age, Misses Priscillaand Sophia Grant. I am not aware that any relationship existed betweenthem and our distinguished ex-President. Nevertheless, they were ofvery respectable family and connections, and of independent property,owning bank stock which brought them in an annual income of abouttwelve hundred dollars, in addition to the house they occupied, andhalf a dozen acres of land thereunto pertaining. Now, this was not acolossal fortune, but in a country place like Crampton it made themladies of large property.Priscilla was the elder of the two, and general manager. Sophiacontented herself with being the echo of her stronger-minded sister,and was very apt to assent to her remarks, either by repeating them,or by saying: "Just so." She was a mild, inoffensive creature, butvery charitable and amiable, and so little given to opposition thatthere was always the greatest harmony between them. They kept agardener and out-of-door servant of all work, who cultivated the land,sawed and split their wood, ran of errands, and made himself generallyuseful. He had one drawback, unfortunately. He would occasionallyindulge to excess in certain fiery alcoholic compounds sold at thevillage tavern, and, as natural consequence, get drunk. He had usuallythe good sense to keep out of the way while under the influence ofliquor, and hitherto the good ladies had borne with and retained himin their employ.But a crisis had arrived. That morning he had come for orders whileinebriated, and in his drunken folly had actually gone so far as tocall Miss Priscilla darling and offer to kiss her.Miss Priscilla was, of course, horrified, and so expressed herself."Law, Sophia," she said, "I came near fainting away. The idea of hisoffering to kiss me.""Just so," said Sophia."So presuming.""Just so.""Of course, I couldn't think of employing him any longer.""Couldn't think of it.""He might have asked to kiss me again.""Just so.""Or you!""Just so," said Sophia, in some excitement of manner."The neighbors would talk.""Just so.""So I told him that I was very sorry, but it would be necessary forhim to find work somewhere else.""But who will do our work?" inquired Sophia, with a rare, originalsuggestion."We must get somebody else.""So we must," acquiesced Sophia, as if she had suddenly received lighton a very dark subject."But I don't know who we can get.""Just so."At that moment there was a knock at the door. Priscilla answered it inperson. They kept no domestic servant, only a gardener."I've brought the load of wood you ordered, ma'am," said the teamster."Where shall I put it?""In the backyard. John--no, John has left us. I will show you,myself."She put on a cape-bonnet and indicated the place in the yard where shewanted the wood dumped.Then she returned to the house."It's very awkward that John should have acted so," she said, in atone of annoyance. "I don't know who is to saw and split that wood.""We couldn't do it," said Sophia, with another original suggestion."Of course not. That would be perfectly absurd.""Just so.""I don't believe there is enough wood sawed and split to last throughthe day.""We must have some split.""Of course. But I really don't know of anyone in the neighborhood thatwe could get.""John.""John has gone away. You know why.""Perhaps he wouldn't kiss us if we told him not to," suggested Sophia."I am afraid you are a goose," said Priscilla, composedly."Just so," slipped out of Sophia's mouth from force of habit, but hersister was so used to hearing it that she took no particular notice ofit on the present occasion.It was just at this time that Andy, released from his severe andunrequited labor for Deacon Jones, came by. He saw the wood beingunloaded in the back yard, and an idea struck him."Maybe I can get the chance of sawin' and splittin' that wood. I'lltry, anyway. I wonder who lives there?"He immediately opened the front gate, and marching up to the frontdoor, knocked vigorously."There's somebody at the door," said Sophia."Perhaps it's John come back," said Priscilla. "I am afraid of goingto open it. He might want to kiss me again.""I'll go," said Sophia, rising with unwonted alacrity."He might want to kiss you.""I'll tell him not to.""We'll both go," said Priscilla, decisively.Accordingly, the two sisters, for mutual protection, both went to thedoor, and opened it guardedly. Their courage returned when they sawthat it was only a boy."What do you want?" asked Priscilla."Just so," chimed in Sophia."You've got a load of wood in the back yard," commenced Andy."Just so," said Sophia."Do you want it sawed and split?""Just so," answered the younger sister, brightening up."Can you do it?" inquired Priscilla."Try me and see," answered Andy."You're not a man.""Just so," chimed in her sister."Faith, and I soon will be," said Andy. "I can saw and split wood aswell as any man you ever saw.""What is your name?""Andy Burke.""Are you a--Hibernian?" inquired Priscilla."I don't know what you mane by that same," said Andy, perplexed."To what nation do you belong?""Oh, that's what you want, ma'am. I'm only an Irish boy.""And you say your name is Burke?""Yes, ma'am.""Are you related to Burke, the great orator? He was an Irishman, Ibelieve.""Just so," said Sophia."He was my great-grandfather, ma'am," answered Andy, who had neverheard of the eminent orator, but thought the claim would improve hischances of obtaining the job of sawing and splitting wood."Your great-grandfather!" exclaimed Priscilla, in astonishment."Really, this is most extraordinary. And you are poor?""If I wasn't I wouldn't be goin' round sawin' wood, ma'am.""Just so," said Sophia."To think that the grandson of the great Burke should come to us foremployment," said Priscilla, who was in some respects easily taken in."I think we must hire him, Sophia.""Just so.""Perhaps he could take John's place altogether.""Just so.""I must find out whether he understands gardening.""Just so."Andy stood by, waiting patiently for the decision, and hoping that itmight be favorable. Of course, it was wrong for him to tell a lie, buthe thought his engagement depended upon it, and, although a very goodboy in the main, he was not altogether perfect, as my readers aredestined to find out.CHAPTER VIIANDY OBTAINS A PLACE"Do you understand the care of a garden?" asked Miss Priscilla."Yes," answered Andy, promptly."Then you are used to agricultural labor?""I've been workin' on a farm all summer.""Our man has just left us, and we must hire somebody else.""Just so," chimed in Sophia."And if you are competent----""Just so.""Try me," said Andy."I really think we'd better, Sophia," said Priscilla, turning to hersister."Just so.""We'll try you for a week. What compensation do you require?""Is it wages you mane?"Of course, Sophia was the speaker."How much did you give the man you had before me?" asked Andy,shrewdly."Twenty-five dollars a month and board.""That'll suit me," said Andy, audaciously.At the farmer's for whom he had been working he had received board anda dollar a week."But you are a boy. Men folks get more than boys.""I'll do as much work as he did any day," said Andy, stoutly."I really don't know what to say. I think we'll give you five dollarsthe first week, and then we will decide about the future.""Just so," said Sophia."I'm to eat here?" inquired Andy."Yes, you will make your home here. We will put you in John's room.""When shall I begin?""We shall need some wood split at once.""All right, ma'am; but it's dinner time. I'll just go home and get abite to keep up my strength.""You can have your dinner here. It will be ready in half an hour.""Just so.""All right," said Andy; "I'm agreeable.""Do you live in the village?""I do now. My mother lives up the road a bit.""Very well. Go and split some wood, and we'll call you in to dinner.You'll find the ax and the saw in the shed."Andy found the articles referred to, and straight-way went to work. Hewas really a "smart boy to work," as the phrase is, and he went towork with a will. He was greatly elated at having secured soprofitable a job. He meant to give satisfaction, so as to keep it.Five dollars a week and board seemed to him a magnificent income, andcompared very favorably with his wages at Farmer Belknap's, where hehad been working all summer."It's lucky I came here," he said to himself, as he plied the sawenergetically; "but what queer old ladies they are, especially the onethat's always sayin' 'just so.' If I'd tell her I'd got fifty-sevengrand-children I'll bet she'd say, 'Just so.'"Miss Sophia was looking out of the back window to see how their new"man" worked. Occasionally Priscilla, as she was setting the table,glanced out of the window in passing."He takes hold as if he knew how," she observed."Just so," responded her sister."I think he works faster than John.""Just so.""It's very strange that he should be the great-grandson of the greatBurke.""Just so.""And that he should be sawing wood for us, too.""Just so.""I think we must be kind to him, sister.""Just so. He won't try to kiss you, Priscilla," said Sophia, with asudden thought."You are a goose, sister," said Priscilla."Just so," assented the other, from force of habit.In due time dinner was ready, and Andy was summoned from the woodpile.He was in nowise sorry for the summons. He had a hearty appetite atall times, and just now it was increased by his unrequited labor inturning the grindstone for Deacon Jones, as well as by the half-hourhe had spent at his new task.The Misses Grant did their own work, as I have before observed. Theywere excellent cooks, and the dinner now upon the table, though plain,was very savory and inviting. Andy's eyes fairly danced withsatisfaction as they rested on the roast beef and vegetables, whichemitted an odor of a highly satisfactory character. At the farmer'swhere he had last worked, the table had been plentifully supplied, butthe cooking was very rudimentary."Sit down, Andrew," said Miss Priscilla. "I think that is your name.""They call me 'Andy,' ma'am.""That means Andrew. Shall I give you some meat?""Thank you, ma'am.""Will you have it rare or well done?""Well done, ma'am. I have it rare enough, anyhow.""Sophia, Andrew has made a joke," said Priscilla, with a decoroussmile."Just so, Priscilla," and Sophia smiled also."I suppose your family has been reduced to poverty, Andrew, or youwould not be seeking employment of this character?""True for you, ma'am," said Andy, with his mouth full."How was your family property lost?""Faith, ma'am, by speculation," said Andy, hazarding a guess."That is very sad. Sophia, we must never speculate.""Just so, Priscilla.""Or we might lose all our money.""And have to saw wood for a living," said Sophia, with anotherbrilliant idea.Andy was so amused at the picture thus suggested that he came nearchoking, but recovered himself, after a violent attack of coughing."I am afraid, Sophia, we should scarcely make a living in that way,"said Priscilla, with a smile."Just so," acquiesced her sister."How long have you been in this country, Andrew?""Six years, ma'am."Andy kept at work industriously. His appetite proved to be quite equalto the emergency, but his evident enjoyment of the dinner onlygratified the ladies, who, though eccentric, were kind-hearted, andnot in the least mean."What will I do, ma'am?" asked our hero."You may go on sawing wood."So Andy resumed work, and worked faithfully during the afternoon. Bythis time there was a large pile of wood ready for the stove.At half-past four Miss Priscilla appeared at the door."Andrew," she said."Yes, ma'am.""Do you feel tired?""A little, ma'am.""Does your mother know where you are?""No, ma'am.""Would you like to go home and tell her?""Yes, ma'am, I would.""You can go now or after supper, as you prefer.""Then I'll go now.""But remember, we want you to come back and sleep here. We do not feelsafe without a man in the house."Andy felt rather flattered at being referred to as a man."I'll be back any time you name, ma'am," he said."Then be here at nine o'clock.""Very well, ma'am."Andy put on his coat and hurried home. He wanted to tell his motherand Mary the good news about his engagement at such unexpected goodwages.Mrs. Burke looked up inquiringly as he entered the house."Where have you been, Andy?" she asked. "I thought I had lost you.""You don't lose me so easy, mother. Shure, I've been at work.""At work?""Yes--I've got a place.""What, already? You are lucky, Andy.""You'll think so, mother. How much do you think I get besides board,mind?""A dollar a week?""What do you say to three dollars?""You're a lucky boy, Andy. I'm glad for you.""What do you say to five dollars a week, mother?" asked Andy, inexultation."You're jokin' now, Andy," said his sister. "I don't believe you'vegot a place at all.""I have, thin, and it's five dollars a week I'm to get. Ask the ouldmaids I'm workin' for.""The Miss Grants?""I expect so. They're mighty queer old ladies. One of 'm is alwayssayin' 'just so.'""That is Miss Sophia Grant.""Just so," said Andy, mimicking her."You mustn't do that, Andy. Then it's them you're workin' for?""Yes, and they're mighty kind. I'm goin' back to sleep there to-night.They want a man to purtect them."Mary laughed."Do you call yourself a man, Andy? What could you do if a burglartried to get in?""I'd give him what Paddy did the drum," said Andy."Supper is ready," announced his mother.It was a cheerful meal. Andy had done much better than his motherexpected, and it seemed likely that they would get along in spite ofher being discharged by Mrs. Preston.CHAPTER VIIITHE MIDNIGHT ALARM"It's time for me to be goin' back," said Andy, as the clock indicatedtwenty minutes to nine."I wish you could sleep at home, Andy," said his mother."They want me to purtect them," said our hero, with a littleimportance. "I'll pack my clothes in a handkerchief.""I've got a little carpetbag," said his mother. "That looks morerespectable. When you have earned enough money, you must have a newsuit of clothes.""How much will they cost, mother?""I think we can get a cheap suit for fifteen or twenty dollars. Whenyou have got the money, we will call on the tailor and see.""Shure, I'll feel like a gentleman with a suit like that.""Mary, go and get the carpetbag. I've packed Andy's clothes all readyfor him."Mary soon reappeared with the carpetbag, and Andy set out on hisreturn.Presently, as the clock struck nine, he knocked at the door of theMisses Grant. The elder opened the door for him."You are punctual, Andrew," she said, approvingly."Yes, ma'am.""Are those your clothes?" pointing to the bag he carried."What few I've got, ma'am. I'm goin' to buy some more when I've gotmoney enough.""That is right. We want you to look respectable.""Just so," remarked Sophia, who felt that it was time for her tospeak.Then a brilliant idea seized her."If he was a girl, we could give him some of our dresses.""But he isn't," said matter-of-fact Priscilla."Or if we were men," continued Sophia, with another brilliant idea."But we are not.""Just so," assented her sister, now brought to the end of hersuggestions.By this time Andy was in the house, holding his cap in one hand, andhis carpetbag in the other."Do you feel tired?" asked Priscilla."Yes, ma'am.""Then, perhaps you would like to go to bed?""I would, if it's just the same to you, ma'am.""Very well, follow me, and I will show you your room. Sophia, perhapsyou had better come, too."They went up the front stairs. The house proper had two rooms on thelower floor, and the two chambers over them. But there was, besides,an extension behind, used as a kitchen, and over this was the roomwhich had been used by John, the former servant."This is your room, Andrew," said Miss Priscilla. "Sophia, will youlift the latch?"The door being opened, revealed a small chamber, with the ceilingpartly sloping. There were two windows. It was very plainly furnished,but looked very comfortable. Andy glanced about him with a look ofsatisfaction. It was considerably more attractive than the bed in theattic which he had occupied at the house of the farmer for whom he hadlast worked."We've put the feather bed at the bottom, as it's summer," said MissPriscilla."All right, ma'am.""There's one thing you've forgotten, Priscilla," suggested Sophia."What is that?""The gun.""Oh, yes. I am glad you reminded me of it. Andrew, can you fire off agun?""Yes, ma'am," said Andrew, glibly.He had never done it, but he had seen a gun fired, and always wantedto make a trial himself."As you are the only menfolks in the house, we should expect you tofire at any robbers that tried to enter the house.""Do you expect any, ma'am?" asked Andy, eagerly."No; but some might come. Of course, we cannot fire guns--it would beimproper, as we are ladies.""Just so," interrupted Sophia."So we shall leave that to you. Do you think you would dare to?""Would I dare, is it?" asked Andy. "Shure, I'd be glad of the chance.""I see you are brave. I'll show you the gun now."She went to the closet in the corner of the room, and pointed out abig, unwieldy musket to Andy. It was in the corner."Is it loaded, ma'am?" he asked."Yes; it has been loaded for a year or more. John never had occasionto use it, and I hope you won't. If any robber should come," added thekind-hearted spinster, "perhaps you had better only shoot him in thearm, and not kill him.""Just as you say, ma'am.""I believe that is all I have to say. Sophia, shall we go to our ownroom?""Just so."So the two maidens withdrew, and Andy was left to his own reflections.He undressed himself quickly, and deposited himself in the bed, whichproved to be very comfortable.He went to bed, but there was one thing that prevented his going tosleep. This was the gun. He had never even had one in his hand, andnow there was one at his absolute disposal. It made him feel a senseof his importance to feel that, upon him, young as he was, devolvedthe duty of defending the house and its occupants from burglary."And why not? Shure, I'm 'most a man," reflected Andy. "I can shootoff a gun as well as anybody. I wonder will robbers come to-night!"thought Andy.He rather wished they would, so that he might have an excuse forfiring the gun. However, of this there seemed very little chance, forhad not Miss Priscilla said that it had been loaded for more than ayear, and during all that time John had never had occasion to use it?This seemed rather discouraging."I wonder would they let me go out gunning with it?" thought Andy.Somehow or other, he could not get his mind off the gun, and, after alapse of an hour, he was as wide awake as ever.Meanwhile, Priscilla and Sophia were both asleep, not being interestedin the gun.Finally it occurred to Andy that he would get up and look at the gun.He wanted to make sure that he understood how to fire it. It wasimportant that he should do so, he reasoned to himself, for might nota burglar come that very night? Then, suppose he was unable to firethe gun, and in consequence of his ignorance, both he and the twoladies should be murdered in their beds. Of course, this was not to bethought of, so Andy got out of bed, and, finding a match, lit thecandle and put it on the bureau, or chest of drawers, as they calledit in the country.Then he stepped softly to the closet and took out the gun."Murder! how heavy it is!" thought Andy. "I didn't think it was halfas heavy. There must be a pound of bullets inside. Now," he said tohimself, "suppose a big thafe was to poke his dirty head in at thewinder and say, 'Give me all your money, or I'll break your head'--I'dput up with the gun and point at him this way."Here Andy brought the gun into position with some difficulty and puthis finger near the trigger."And I'd say," continued Andy, rehearsing his part, "'Jump down, youthafe, or I'll put a bullet through your head.'"At that unlucky moment his finger accidentally pulled the trigger, andinstantly there was a tremendous report, the noise being increased bythe shattering of the window panes by the bullet.Probably the charge was too heavy, for the gun "kicked," and Andy, tohis astonishment, found himself lying flat on his back on the floor,with the gun lying beside him."Oh, murder!" ejaculated the bewildered boy, "is it dead I am? Shure,the divil's in the gun. What will the ould wimmen say? They'll thinkit's bloody burglars gettin' into the house. Shure, I'll slip on mypants, for they'll be coming to see what's happened."He picked himself up, and slipped on his pants. He had scarcely gotthem on when the trembling voice of Miss Priscilla was heard at thedoor.CHAPTER IXWHAT FOLLOWEDThe report of the gun, as may be supposed, had aroused both the ladiesfrom their sleep."Did you hear it?" ejaculated Miss Priscilla, clutching her sister bythe arm."Just so," muttered Sophia, in bewilderment. "It's the gun.""Burglars!" exclaimed Sophia, in alarm."I am afraid so. What shall we do?""Run away," suggested Sophia."No, we must not leave the boy to be murdered.""Perhaps he has shot them?" said Sophia, with a gleam of hope."At any rate, it is our duty to go and see what has happened.""I'm afraid," whimpered Sophia, covering up her head."Then you can stay here," said the more courageous Priscilla. "I willgo.""And leave me alone?""I must.""I'll go too, then," said Sophia, her teeth chattering with fear.So they crept out of bed, and throwing shawls over their shoulders,advanced into the entry, trembling with excitement and fear."If we should find Andy weltering in his gore?" suggested Priscilla."Don't say such horrid things, or I shall scream," said her sister.Then came the tremulous knock mentioned at the close of the lastchapter.Andy opened the door in person, and met the gaze of the two MissGrants, Sophia almost ready to drop with fright."Do you see any gore, Priscilla?" she asked, tremulously."Are you hurt, Andrew?" asked the elder sister."No, ma'am.""Did you fire the gun?""Yes, ma'am.""What made you? Did any burglars try to get in?""Not exactly, ma'am," said Andy; "but I thought there might be some.""Did you see any?""Not exactly," said Andy, a little embarrassed; "but I heard a noise.""Just so," said Sophia."Why didn't you wait till they appeared at the window, Andrew?""Because, ma'am, they would fire at me first. I wanted to scare 'emaway.""Perhaps you were right. You don't see any traces of them outside, doyou?""You can look for yourself, ma'am."The two ladies went to the window, which as already explained, hadsuffered from the discharge, and peered out timidly, but, of course,saw no burglars."Are you sure there were any burglars, Andrew?" asked Priscilla."No, ma'am, I couldn't swear to it.""Well, no harm has been done.""Except breakin' the winder, ma'am.""Never mind; we will have that mended to-morrow.""Were you afraid, Andrew?" asked Miss Sophia."Not a bit," answered Andy, valiantly. "I ain't afraid of burglars, aslong as I have a gun. I'm a match for 'em.""How brave he is!" exclaimed the timid lady. "We might have beenkilled in our beds. I'm glad we hired him, Priscilla.""As there is nothing more to do, we had better go to bed.""Just so.""That's a bully way to get out of a scrape," said Andy to himself, asthe ladies filed out of his chamber. "I expected they'd scold me.Plague take the old gun--it kicks as bad as a mule. Oh, Andy, you're alucky boy to get off so well."The next day Andy obtained permission to take out the gun in theafternoon when his chores were done."I want to get used to it, ma'am," he said. "It kicked last night.""Dear me, did it?" asked Sophia. "I didn't know guns kicked. What dothey kick with? They haven't got any legs."Andy explained as well as he could what he meant by the gun's kicking,and said it was because it had not been used for a good while, andneeded to be taken out."It needs exercise, just like horses, ma'am," he said."That is singular, Andrew," said Priscilla."Just so," observed her sister."It's a fact, ma'am," said Andy. "It gets skittish, just likehorses--but if I take it out sometimes, it'll be all right.""Very well, you may take it, only be careful.""Oh, I'll be careful, ma'am," said Andy, with alacrity."Now, I'll have some fun," he said to himself.He found a supply of powder and some shot in the closet, and proceededto appropriate them."Come back in time for supper, Andrew," said Miss Priscilla."Yes, ma'am, I'm always on hand at meal times," answered our hero."That's because he's hungry," said Sophia, brilliantly."You're right, ma'am," said Andy; "my stomach always tells me whenit's supper time.""It's as good as a watch," said Priscilla, smiling."And a good deal cheaper," observed Sophia, with another brilliantidea.Andy started up the road with his gun over his shoulder. It was hisintention after going a little distance to strike into the fields, andmake for some woods not far away, where he thought there would be agood chance for birds or squirrels. He hadn't gone many steps beforehe encountered Godfrey Preston, his antagonist of three days previous.Now, Godfrey hadn't seen or heard anything of Andy since that day. Hehad learned from his mother with great satisfaction that she haddischarged Mrs. Burke from her employment, as this, he imagined, wouldtrouble Andy. But of Andy himself he knew nothing, and was not awarethat he had already secured a place. When he saw our hero comingalong, his curiosity led him to stop and find out, if he could, wherehe was going with the gun he carried on his shoulder, and where heobtained it. So he looked intently at Andy, waiting for him to speak,but Andy preferred to leave that to him."Whose gun is that?" asked Godfrey, in the tone of one who wasentitled to ask the question."Shure, it belongs to the owner," said Andy, with a smile."Of course, I know that," said Godfrey, impatiently. "I'm not quite afool.""Not quite," repeated Andy, emphasizing the last word in a way whichmade Godfrey color."What do you mean?" he said."What do I mane? It was only your words I repeated.""Then, don't trouble yourself to repeat them--do you hear?""Thank you; I won't.""You didn't tell me whose gun that is.""No, I didn't.""Very likely you stole it," said Godfrey, provoked."Maybe you'll go and tell the owner.""How can I when you haven't told me whose it is?""No more I did," said Andy with apparent innocence."Where are you going with it?""Goin' out shootin'.""So I supposed.""Did you, now? Then what made you ask?" returned Andy."You are an impudent fellow," said Godfrey, provoked."I never am impudent to gentlemen," said Andy, pointedly."Do you mean to say that I am not a gentleman?" demanded the other,angrily."Suit yourself," said Andy, coolly."You're only an Irish boy.""Shure, I knew that before. Why can't you tell me some news? I'm anIrish boy and I'm proud of the same. I'll never go back on ouldIreland.""The Irish are a low set.""Are they now? Maybe you never heard of Burke, the great orator.""What of him?""Shure, he was an Irishman; and isn't my name Andy Burke, and wasn'the my great-grandfather?""He must be proud of his great-grandson," said Godfrey, sarcastically."I never axed him, but no doubt you're right. But it's time I wasgoin', or I shan't get any birds. Would you like to come with me?""No, I am particular about the company I keep.""I'm not, or I wouldn't have invited you," said Andy, who was ratherquicker witted than his opponent."I should like to know where he got that gun," said Godfrey tohimself, following with his eyes the retreating figure of our hero. "Iam sure that isn't his gun. Ten to one he stole it from somebody."But Godfrey's curiosity was not destined to be gratified thatafternoon, as it might have been if he had seen Andy turning into theyard of the Misses Grant two hours afterward. He had not shotanything, but he had got used to firing the gun, and was not likely tobe caught again in any such adventure as that recorded in the lastchapter.CHAPTER XANDY'S DEBUT AT SCHOOLThe first of September came, and with it came the opening of the fallschools. On the first day, when Andy, at work in the yard, saw theboys and the girls go by with their books, he felt a longing to go,too. He knew very well that his education had been very muchneglected, and that he knew less of books than a boy of his age oughtto do."I wish I could go to school this term," he said to himself; "but it'sno use wishin'. Mother needs my wages, and I must keep on workin'."The same thought had come to the Misses Grant. Andy had been in theiremploy now for six weeks, and by his unfailing good humor andreadiness to oblige, had won their favor. They felt interested in hisprogress, and, at the same moment that the thought referred to passedthough Andy's mind, Miss Priscilla said to her sister:"The fall school begins to-day. There's Godfrey Preston just passedwith some books under his arm.""Just so.""I suppose Andrew would like to be going to school with other boys ofhis age.""Just so.""Don't you think we could spare him to go half the day?""Just so," said Sophia, with alacrity."There isn't so much work to do now as there was in the summer, and hecould do his chores early in the morning. He could go to school in theforenoon and work in the afternoon.""Just so, Priscilla. Shall we give him less wages?""No, I think not. He needs the money to give his mother.""Call him in and tell him," suggested Sophia."It will do at dinner time.""Just so."When the dinner was over, and Andy rose from the table, Miss Priscillaintroduced the subject."Are you a good scholar, Andrew?""I'm a mighty poor one, ma'am.""Did you ever study much?""No, ma'am, I've had to work ever since I was so high," indicating apoint about two feet from the ground."Dear me," said Sophia, "you must have been very small.""Yes, ma'am, I was very small of my size.""I've been thinking, Andrew, that perhaps we could spare you half theday, so that you could go to school in the forenoon--you could learnsomething in three hours--should you like it?""Would I like it, ma'am? Wouldn't I, though? I don't want to grow up apoor, ignorant crathur, hardly able to read and write.""Then you can go to school to-morrow, and ask the teacher if he willtake you for half the day. You can get up early, and get your choresdone before school.""Oh, yes, ma'am, I can do that easy.""I think we have some schoolbooks in the house. Some years ago we hada nephew stay with us, and go to school. I think his books are stillin the closet.""Thank you, ma'am. It'll save me buyin', and I haven't got any moneyto spare.""We shall give you the same wages, Andrew, though you will work less.""Thank you, ma'am. You're very kind.""Try to improve your time in school, as becomes the great-grandson ofsuch a distinguished orator.""I'll try, ma'am," said Andy, looking a little queer at this allusionto the great Edmund Burke. In fact, he was ashamed of having deceivedthe kind old ladies, but didn't like now to own up to the deceptionlest they should lose confidence in him. But he determined hereafterto speak the truth, and not resort to deception.The next morning, at twenty minutes of nine, Andy left the houseprovided with books, and joyfully took his way to the schoolhouse,which was a quarter of a mile distant. As he ascended the small hillon which it stood, he attracted the attention of a group of boys whohad already arrived. Among them was his old adversary, GodfreyPreston."Is that Irish boy coming to school?" he said in a tone of disgust."What? Andy Burke? I hope so," said Charles Fleming, "he's a goodfellow.""He's only an Irish boy," said Godfrey, with a sneer."And I am only an American boy," said Charles, good-humoredly."You can associate with him if you want to; I shan't," said Godfrey."That's where I agree with you, Godfrey," said Ben Travers, who madehimself rather a toady of Godfrey's.Andy had now come up, so that Charles Fleming did not reply, butcalled out, cordially:"Are you coming to school, Andy?""Yes," said Andy."I'm glad of it.""Thank you," said Andy. "What's the matter with them fellows," asGodfrey and Bill Travers walked off haughtily, tossing their heads.Charles Fleming laughed."They don't think we are good enough for their company," he said."I'm not anxious for it," said Andy. "I like yours better.""I didn't think you could get away from work to come to school. Areyou working for Miss Grant now?""Yes, but she lets me come to school half the day. She's a bully ouldlady.""Well, half a loaf's better than no bread. Will you sit with me? I'vegot no one at my desk. Say yes.""It's just what I'd like, Charlie, but maybe Godfrey Preston wants tosit with me. I wouldn't like to disappoint him," said Andy, with slyhumor."Sit with me till he invites you, then.""That'll be a long day."They went into the schoolhouse, and Andy deposited his books in thedesk next to Charlie Fleming's. He couldn't have wished for a betteror more agreeable companion. Charlie was the son of Dr. Fleming, thevillage physician, and was a general favorite in the town on accountof his sunny, attractive manner. But, with all his affability, he wasindependent and resolute, if need be. He was one of the leaders of theschool. Godfrey aspired also to be a leader, and was to some extent onaccount of his father's wealth and high standing, for, as we haveseen, Colonel Preston was not like his son. Still, it is doubtfulwhether anyone was much attached to Godfrey. He was too selfish indisposition, and offensively consequential in manner, to inspiredevoted friendship. Ben Travers, however, flattered him, and followedhim about, simply because he was the son of a rich man. Such casesoccur sometimes among American schoolboys, but generally they are toodemocratic and sensible to attach importance to social distinctions inthe schoolroom, or in the playground.When the teacher--a certain Ebenezer Stone, a man of thirty orupward--entered, Andy went up to him and asked permission to attendschool a part of the time. As there had been such cases in formerterms, no objection was offered by the teacher, and Andy went back tohis seat, a regularly admitted member of the school.It was found necessary to put him in a low class to begin with. He wasnaturally bright, but, as we know, his opportunities of learning hadbeen very limited, and he could not be expected to know much. But Andywas old enough now to understand the worth of knowledge, and hedevoted himself so earnestly to study that in the course of threeweeks he was promoted to a higher class. This, however, isanticipating.When recess came, the scholars poured out upon the playround. CharlesFleming and Godfrey Preston happened to pass out side by side."I see you've taken that Irish boy to sit with you," he said."You mean Andy Burke? Yes, I invited him to be my desk-fellow.""I congratulate you on your high-toned and aristocratic associate,"observed Godfrey, sarcastically."Thank you. I am glad to have him with me.""I wouldn't condescend to take him into my seat.""Nor do I. There isn't any condescension about it.""He works for a living.""So does my father, and so does yours. Are you going to cut yourfather's acquaintance for that reason?""My father could live without work.""He doesn't choose to, and that's where he shows his good sense.""It's a different kind of work from sawing and splitting wood, andsuch low labor.""It strikes me, Godfrey, that you ought to have been born somewhereelse than in America. In this country labor is considered honorable.You ought to be living under a monarchy.""I don't believe in associating with inferiors.""I don't look upon Andy Burke as my inferior," said Charlie. "He ispoor, to be sure, but he is a good fellow, and helps support hismother and sister, as I would do in his place.""Charlie Fleming," was heard from the playground, "come and choose upfor baseball."Without waiting for an answer, Charlie ran to the field alongside theschoolhouse, where the game was to take place.CHAPTER XIA GAME OF BALL"Come here," said Conrad Fletcher; "come here, Charlie, and choose upfor a game. We must make haste, or recess will be over.""All right, Conrad."The first choice devolved upon Conrad. He chose Ephraim Pinkham, notedas a catcher."I take Elmer Rhodes," said Charlie."John Parker," said Conrad."Henry Strauss.""Godfrey Preston," was Conrad's next choice."Can you play, Andy?" asked Charlie."Yes," said Andy."Then, I take you.""I've a good mind to resign," said Godfrey, in a low voice, to BenTravers. "I don't fancy playing with that Irish boy."However, he was too fond of playing to give up his place,notwithstanding his antipathy to Andy.Charlie Fleming's side went in first, and Charlie himself went to thebat. The pitcher was Godfrey. He was really a fair pitcher, andconsidered himself very superior. Charlie finally succeeded in hittingthe ball, but rather feebly, and narrowly escaped losing his firstbase. He saved it, however.Next at the bat was Elmer Rhodes. He hit one or two fouls, but not afair ball. Finally he was put out on three strikes; meanwhile,however, Charlie Fleming got round to third base. Henry Strausssucceeded in striking the ball, but it was caught by center field,rapidly sent to first base, before Henry could reach it, then thrownto the catcher in time to prevent Charlie Fleming from getting in. Heran half-way to home base, but seeing his danger, ran back to thirdbase. Next Andy took the bat."Knock me in, Andy," called out Charlie Fleming."All right" said Andy, quietly."Not if I can prevent it," said Godfrey to himself, and he determinedby sending poor balls, to get our hero out on three strikes. The firstball, therefore, he sent about six feet to the right of the batter.Andy stood in position, but, of course, was far too wise to attempthitting any such ball. The next ball went several feet above his head.Of this, too, he took no notice. The third would have hit him if hehad not dodged."Why don't you knock at the balls?" asked Godfrey."I will, when you give better ones," said Andy, coolly."I don't believe you know how to bat," said Godfrey, with a sneer."I don't believe you know how to pitch," returned Andy."How's that?" sending another ball whizzing by his left ear."I want them waist-high," said Andy. "My waist is about two feet lowerthan my ears."Godfrey now resolved to put in a ball waist-high, but so swiftly thatAndy could not hit it; but he had never seen Andy play. Our hero had awonderfully quick eye and steady hand, and struck the ball with suchforce to left field, that not only Charlie Fleming got in, withoutdifficulty, but Andy himself made a home run."That's a splendid hit," exclaimed Charlie, with enthusiasm. "I didn'tthink you could play so well.""I've played before to-day," said Andy, composedly. "I told you Iwould get you in, and I meant what I said."Godfrey looked chagrined at the result. He meant to demonstrate thatAndy was no player, but had only contributed to his brilliant success;for, had he not sent in so swift a ball, the knock would not have beenso forcible.As there were but six on a side, two outs were considered all out."Who will catch?" asked Charlie Fleming; "I want to pitch.""I will," said Andy."All right! If you can catch as you can bat, we'll cut down theirscore."Andy soon showed that he was no novice at catching. He rarely let aball pass him. When Godfrey's turn came to bat, one was already out,and Andy determined to put Godfrey out if it was a possible thing. Onestrike had been called, when Godfrey struck a foul which was almostimpossible to catch. But now Andy ran, made a bound into the air, andcaught it--a very brilliant piece of play, by which Godfrey and hisside were put out. The boys on both sides applauded, for it was apiece of brilliant fielding which not one of them was capable of. Thatis, all applauded but Godfrey. He threw down his bat spitefully, andsaid to Fleming:"You didn't give me good balls.""I gave you much better than you gave Andy," said Charlie."That's so!" chimed in two other boys."I won't play any more," said Godfrey.Just then the bell rang, so that the game was brought to a close. Andyreceived the compliments of the boys on his brilliant playing. Hereceived them modestly, and admitted that he probably couldn't makesuch a catch again. It was very disagreeable to Godfrey to hear Andypraised. He was rather proud of his ball-playing, and he saw that Andywas altogether his superior, at any rate in the opinion of the boys.However, he ingeniously contrived to mingle a compliment with a sneer."You're more used to baseball than to books," he said."True for you," said Andy."You're a head taller than any of the boys in your class.""I know that," said Andy. "I haven't been to school as much as you.""I should be ashamed if I didn't know more.""So you ought," said Andy, "for you've been to school all your life. Ihope to know more soon.""Anyway, you can play ball," said Charlie Fleming."I'd rather be a good scholar.""I'll help you, if you want any help.""Thank you, Charlie."They had now entered the schoolroom, and Andy took up his book andstudied hard. He was determined to rise to a higher class as soon aspossible, for it was not agreeable to him to reflect that he was theoldest and largest boy in his present class."Very well," said the teacher, when his recitation was over. "If youcontinue to recite in this way, you will soon be promoted.""I'll do my best, sir," said Andy, who listened to these words withpleasure."I wish you were coming in the afternoon, too, Andy," said his friend,Charlie Fleming, as they walked home together."So do I, Charlie, but I must work for my mother.""That's right, Andy; I'd do the same in your place. I haven't suchfoolish ideas about work as Godfrey Preston.""He ain't very fond of me," said Andy, laughing."No; nor of anybody else. He only likes Godfrey Preston.""We got into a fight the first day I ever saw him.""What was it about?""He called my mother names, and hit me. So I knocked him flat.""You served him right. He's disgustingly conceited. Nobody likes him.""Ben Travers goes around with him all the time.""Ben likes him because he is rich. If he should lose his property,you'd see how soon he would leave him. That isn't a friend worthhaving.""I've got one consolation," said Andy, laughing; "nobody likes me formy money.""But someone likes you for yourself, Andy," said Charlie."Who?""Myself, to be sure.""And I like you as much, Charlie," said Andy, warmly. "You're tentimes as good a fellow as Godfrey.""I hope so," said Charlie. "That isn't saying very much, Andy."So the friendship was cemented, nor did it end there. Charlie spoke ofAndy's good qualities at home, and some time afterward Andy wassurprised by an invitation to spend the evening at Dr. Fleming's. Hefelt a little bashful, but finally went--nor was he at all sorry forso doing. The whole family was a delightful one, and Andy was welcomedas a warm friend of Charlie's, and, in the pleasant atmosphere of thedoctor's fireside, he quite forgot that there was one who looked downupon him as an inferior being.Dr. Fleming had himself been a poor boy. By a lucky chance--orProvidence, rather--he had been put in the way of obtaining aneducation, and he was not disposed now, in his prosperity, to forgethis days of early struggle.Andy found that, in spite of the three hours taken up at school, hewas able to do all that was required of him by the Misses Grant. Theywere glad to hear of his success at school, and continued to pay himfive dollars a week for his services. This money he regularly carriedto his mother, after paying for the new clothes, of which he stood somuch in need.CHAPTER XIIA LITTLE DIFFICULTYIt has already been said that Godfrey Preston was a conceited andarrogant boy. He had a very high idea of his own importance, andexpected that others would acknowledge it; but he was not altogethersuccessful. He would like to have had Andy Burke look up to him as amember of a superior class, and in that case might have condescendedto patronize him, as a chieftain might in the case of a humbleretainer. But Andy didn't want to be patronized by Godfrey. He nevershowed by his manner that he felt beneath him socially, and thisgreatly vexed Godfrey."His mother used to iron at our house," he said to Ben Travers oneday; "but my mother discharged her. I don't see why the boys treat himas an equal. I won't, for my part.""Of course, he isn't your equal," said the subservient Ben. "That's agood joke.""He acts as if he was," said Godfrey, discontentedly."It's only his impudence.""You are right," said Godfrey, rather liking this explanation. "He isone of the most impudent boys I know. I wish my father would send meto a fashionable school, where I shouldn't meet such fellows. That'sthe worst of these public schools--you meet all sorts of persons inthem.""Of course you do.""I suppose this Burke will be a hod-carrier, or something of thatkind, when he is a man.""While you are a member of Congress.""Very likely," said Godfrey, loftily; "and he will claim that he wasan old schoolmate of mine. It is disgusting.""Of course it is. However, we needn't notice him.""I don't mean to."But in the course of the next week there was an occurrence whichcompelled Godfrey to "notice" his detested schoolfellow.Among the scholars was a very pleasant boy of twelve, named AlfredParker. He was the son of a poor widow, and was universally liked forhis amiable and obliging disposition. One morning, before school, hewas engaged in some game which required him to run. He accidentallyran against Godfrey, who was just coming up the hill, withconsiderable force. Now, it was very evident that it was whollyunintentional; but Godfrey was greatly incensed."What do you mean by that, you little scamp?" he exclaimed, furiously."Excuse me, Godfrey; I didn't mean to run into you.""That don't go down.""Indeed, I didn't. I didn't see you.""I can't help it. You ought to have been more careful. Take that, tomake you more careful."As he said this, he seized him by the collar, and, tripping him, laidhim flat on his back."For shame, Godfrey!" said another boy standing by; but as it was asmall boy, Godfrey only answered:"If you say that again, I'll serve you the same way."Alfred tried to get up, but Godfrey put his knee on his breast."Let me up, Godfrey," said Alfred, piteously. "I can't breathe. Youhurt me.""I'll teach you to run into me," said the bully."I didn't mean to.""I want to make sure of your not doing it again.""Do let me up," said Alfred.In return, Godfrey only pressed more heavily, and the little fellowbegan to cry. But help was near at hand. Andy Burke happened to comeup the hill just then, and saw what was going on. He had a naturalchivalry that prompted him always to take the weaker side. But besidesthis, he liked Alfred for his good qualities, and disliked Godfrey forhis bad ones. He did not hesitate a moment, therefore, but ran up,and, seizing Godfrey by the collar with a powerful grasp, jerked himon his back in the twinkling of an eye. Then, completely turning thetables, he put his knee on Godfrey's breast, and said:"Now, you know how it is yourself. How do you like it?""Let me up," demanded Godfrey, furiously."That's what Alfred asked you to do," said Andy, coolly. "Why didn'tyou do it?""Because I didn't choose," answered the prostrate boy, almost foamingat the mouth with rage and humiliation."Then I don't choose to let you up.""You shall suffer for this," said Godfrey, struggling, but in vain."Not from your hands. Oh, you needn't try so hard to get up. I canhold you here all day if I choose.""You're a low Irish boy!""You're lower than I am just now," said Andy."Let me up.""Why didn't you let Alfred up?""He ran against me.""Did he mean to?""No, I didn't, Andy," said Alfred, who was standing near. "I toldGodfrey so, but he threw me over, and pressed on my breast so hardthat it hurt me.""In this way," said Andy, increasing the pressure on his prostrateenemy.Godfrey renewed his struggles, but in vain."Please let him up now, Andy," said Alfred, generously."If he'll promise not to touch you any more, I will.""I won't promise," said Godfrey. "I won't promise anything to a lowbeggar.""Then you must feel the low beggar's knee," said Andy."You wouldn't have got me down if I had been looking. You got theadvantage of me.""Did I? Well, then, I'll give you a chance."Andy rose to his feet, and Godfrey, relieved from the pressure, arose,too. No sooner was he up than he flew like an enraged tiger at ourhero, but Andy was quite his equal in strength, and, being cool, hadthe advantage.The result was that in a few seconds he found himself once more on hisback."You see," said Andy, "it isn't safe for you to attack me. I won'tkeep you down any longer, but if you touch Alfred again, I'll give yousomething worse."Godfrey arose from the ground, and shook his fist at Andy."I'll make you remember this," he said."I want you to remember it yourself," said Andy.Godfrey didn't answer, but made his way to the schoolroom, sullenly."Thank you, Andy," said Alfred, gratefully, "for saving me fromGodfrey. He hurt me a good deal.""He's a brute," said Andy, warmly. "Don't be afraid of him, Alfred,but come and tell me if he touches you again. I'll give him somethinghe won't like.""You must be very strong, Andy," said the little boy, admiringly. "Youknocked him over just as easy."Andy laughed."Did you ever know an Irish boy that couldn't fight?" he asked. "I'mbetter with my fists than with my brains, Alfred.""That's because you never went to school much. You're getting on fast,Andy.""I'm tryin', Alfred," he said. "It's a shame for a big boy like me notto know as much as a little boy like you.""You'll soon get ahead of me, Andy."Meanwhile Godfrey had taken his place in school, feeling far fromcomfortable. He was outraged by the thought that Andy, whom heregarded as so much beneath him, should have had the audacity to throwhim down, and put his knees on his breast. It made him grind his teethwhen he thought of it. What should he do about it? He wanted to berevenged in some way, and he meant to be.Finally he decided to report Andy to the teacher, and, if possible,induce him to punish him."The teacher knows that my father's a man of influence," he said tohimself. "He will believe me before that ragamuffin. If he don't, I'lltry to get him turned away."When, therefore, the bell rang for recess, and the rest of thescholars hurried to the playground, Godfrey lingered behind. He waitedtill all the boys were gone, and then went up to the teacher."Well, Godfrey, what is it?" asked the master."Mr. Stone, I want to make a complaint against Andrew Burke," saidGodfrey."What has he done?""He is a brute," said Godfrey, in an excited manner. "He dared to comeup behind my back before school began, and knock me down. Then he puthis knee on my chest, and wouldn't let me up.""What made him do it?""He knows I don't like him, and am not willing to associate with him.""Was that all the reason?" asked the teacher, keenly."I suppose so," said Godfrey."I was not aware that Andy Burke was quarrelsome," said the teacher."He behaves well in school.""Because he knows he must.""Very well; I will inquire into the matter after recess."Godfrey went back to his seat, triumphant. He didn't doubt that hisenemy would be severely punished.CHAPTER XIIIGODFREY'S REBELLIONHaving made his complaint, Godfrey waited impatiently for the recessto close, in order that he might see retribution fall upon the head ofAndy. He had not long to wait. Meanwhile, however, he was missed inthe playground."Where's Godfrey?" asked one of the boys."He don't want to come out. He got a licking from Andy Burke.""I ain't much sorry. It'll cure him of some of his airs.""I don't know about that. It comes natural to him to put on airs.""If anybody has insulted Godfrey," remarked Ben Travers, his toady,"he had better look out for himself.""Do you hear that, Andy? Ben Travers says you must look out foryourself.""Who's goin' to punish me?" asked Andy. "If it's Ben, let him comeon."But Ben showed no disposition to "come on." He could talk andthreaten, but when words were to be succeeded by blows he never was onhand. In fact he was a coward, and ought to have kept quiet, but it isjust that class that are usually most noisy.Andy had no idea that Godfrey would complain to the teacher in amatter where he was so clearly in the wrong, nor would he if he hadnot relied upon his father's position to carry him through."Mr. Stone is a poor man," he thought, "and he won't dare to take thepart of a low Irish boy against the only son and heir of ColonelPreston. He knows on which side his bread is buttered, and he won't besuch a fool as to offend my father."While he said this he knew that it was very doubtful whether hisfather would espouse his cause, but then Mr. Stone would probablysuppose he would, which would answer the same purpose on the presentoccasion.When Andy re-entered the schoolroom with the rest of the boys at thetermination of recess, he saw Godfrey in his seat. The latter dartedat him a glance of malicious triumph.When the noise of entering was over, Mr. Stone said:"Andrew Burke, come forward!"Considerably surprised, Andy came forward, and looked up with a modestself-possession into the teacher's face."A complaint has been entered against you, Andrew," Mr. Stone began."What is it, sir?" asked Andy."You are charged by Godfrey Preston with violently assaulting andthrowing him down, just before school commenced. Is this true?""Yes, sir," answered Andy, promptly."You are charged with kneeling down upon him, and preventing hisgetting up.""That is true," said Andy, quite composedly."I am surprised that you should have acted in this manner," said Mr.Stone. "I did not think you quarrelsome or a bully.""I hope I am not," said Andy. "Did Godfrey tell you why I knocked himover?""He said it was because he would not associate with you."Andy laughed."I hope you'll excuse my laughing, sir," he said, respectfully; "butI'd rather associate with any of the boys than with Godfrey. I likehim least of all.""Then, that is the reason you attacked him, is it?""No, sir.""Then, what was it?""If you don't mind, sir, I'd like to have you ask Alfred Parker.""Alfred Parker," called out the teacher, "come forward."Alfred obeyed."Do you know why Andrew attacked Godfrey Preston?""Yes, sir; it was on my account.""On your account! Explain.""This morning, before school, I was playing with another boy, andaccidentally ran into Godfrey. He got mad, and threw me overviolently. Then he pressed his knee on my breast till I could hardlybreathe. I begged him to let me up, but he would not, though he knewthat it was only an accident. While I was lying on the ground, AndyBurke came up. He no sooner saw me than he ran up, and threw Godfreyoff, and got on him in the same manner, and I think he served himright."As he uttered these last words, Godfrey scowled ominously, but Andy'sface brightened up. He was glad that Alfred was brave enough to speakup for him."This alters the case considerably," said the teacher. "Is there anyother boy who witnessed the affair, and can substantiate what has beensaid? If so, let him raise his hand."Herman Reynolds raised his hand."Well, Herman, what do you know about it? Were you present?""Yes, sir, I was. It was just as Alfred said it was.""What have you to say, Godfrey?" asked Mr. Stone, sternly."I don't mean to be insulted by an Irish boy," said Godfrey,haughtily."Remember where you are, sir, and speak in a more becoming manner. Didyou attack Alfred Parker, as he says?""He had no business to run into me.""Answer my question.""Yes, I did.""And did you kneel on his breast?""Yes.""Oblige me by saying, 'Yes, sir.'""Yes, sir," said Godfrey, reluctantly."Why do you complain, then, of being treated in a similar manner byAndrew?""He has no business to touch me.""If he had not interfered when he saw you maltreating his youngschoolfellow, I should have been ashamed of him," said the teacher.This so far chimed in with the sentiment of the boys that they almostinvoluntarily applauded; and one boy, arising, exclaimed:"Three cheers for the teacher!"The three cheers were given with a will, and, though they were,strictly speaking, out of order, Mr. Stone was a sensible man, and theonly notice he took of it was to say:"Thank you, boys. I am glad to find that you agree with me on thispoint, and that your sympathies are with the weak and oppressed.Godfrey Preston, your complaint is dismissed. I advise you to ceaseacting the part of a bully, or you may get another similar lesson.Andrew, when you exert your strength, I hope it will always be in asjust a cause. You may take your seat, and you also, Alfred."The boys would have applauded again, but Mr. Stone said, waving hishand:"Once is enough, boys. Time is precious, and we must now go on withour lessons. First class in arithmetic."Godfrey had been equally surprised and angry at the turn that affairshad taken. He was boiling with indignation, and nervously moved aboutin his seat. After a slight pause, having apparently taken hisdetermination, he took his cap, and walked toward the door.Mr. Stone's attention was drawn to him."Where are you going, Godfrey?" he demanded, quickly."Home," said Godfrey."You will wait till the end of school.""I would rather not, sir.""It makes no difference what you would rather do, or rather not do.Are you sick?""No, sir.""Then you have no good cause for leaving, and I shall not permit youto do so.""I have been insulted, sir, and I don't wish to stay.""By whom?" demanded the teacher, sharply.Godfrey would like to have said, "By you," but he saw the teacher'skeen eye fixed upon him, and he didn't dare to do it. He hesitated."By whom?" repeated Mr. Stone."By Andrew Burke.""That is no good reason for your leaving school, or would not be, ifit were true, but it is not. He has only meted out to you the samepunishment you undertook to inflict upon a smaller boy. Take yourseat.""My father will take me away from school," said Godfrey, angrily."We shall none of us mourn for your absence. Take your seat."This last remark of the teacher still further incensed Godfrey, andled him temporarily to forget himself. Though he had been bidden totake his seat, he resolved to leave the schoolroom, and made a rushfor the door. But Mr. Stone was there before him. He seized Godfrey bythe collar and dragged him, shaking him as he proceeded, to his seat,on which he placed him with some emphasis."That is the way I treat rebels," he said. "You forget yourself,Preston. The next time you make up your mind to resist my commands,count in advance on a much severer lesson."Godfrey was pale with passion, and his hands twitched convulsively. Heonly wished he had Mr. Stone in his power for five minutes. He wouldtreat him worse than he did Alfred Parker. But a boy in a passion isnot a very pleasant spectacle. It is enough to say that Godfrey wascompelled to stay in school for the remainder of the forenoon. As soonas he could get away, he ran home, determined to enlist his mother inhis cause.CHAPTER XIVMR. STONE IS CALLED TO ACCOUNTAt home Godfrey gave a highly colored narrative of the outrageousmanner in which he had been abused, for so he chose to represent it.He gave this account to his mother, for his father was not at home.Indeed, he was absent for a day or two in a distant city.Mrs. Preston was indignant."It is an outrage, Godfrey," she said, compressing her thin lips. "Howdid Mr. Stone dare to treat you in this way?""I was surprised, myself," said Godfrey."Had he no more respect for your father's prominent position?""It looks as if he didn't.""He is evidently unfit to keep the school. I shall try to persuadeyour father to have him turned away.""I wish he might be," said Godfrey. "It would teach him to treat mewith proper respect. Anybody would think that Irish boy was the son ofthe most important man in town."Both Godfrey and his mother appeared to take it for granted that ateacher should treat his pupils according to their social position.This is certainly very far from proper, as all my youthful readerswill, I hope, agree."I don't want to go back to school this afternoon, mother," saidGodfrey."I don't wonder," said his mother. "I will tell you what I will do. Iwill send a letter to Mr. Stone by you, asking him to call here thisevening. I will then take occasion to express my opinion of hisconduct.""That's good, mother," said Godfrey, joyfully.He knew that his mother had a sharp tongue, and he longed to hear hismother "give it" to the teacher whom he hated."Then, you think I had better go to school this afternoon?""Yes, with the note. If Mr. Stone does not apologize, you need not goto-morrow. I will go upstairs and write it at once."The note was quickly written, and, putting it carefully in his insidepocket, Godfrey went to school. As he entered the schoolroom hestepped up to the desk and handed the note to Mr. Stone."Here is a note from my mother," he said, superciliously."Very well," said the teacher, taking it gravely.As it was not quite time to summon the pupils, he opened it at once.This was what he read:    "MR. STONE: Sir--My son Godfrey informs me that you have    treated him in a very unjust manner, for which I find it    impossible to account. I shall be glad if you can find time    to call at my house this evening, in order that I may hear    from your lips an explanation of the occurrence. Yours, in    haste,                                       "Lucinda Preston.""Preston," said Mr. Stone, after reading this note, "you may say toyour mother that I will call this evening."He did not appear in the least disturbed by the contents of the notehe had received from the richest and--in her own eyes--the mostimportant lady in the village. In fact, he had a large share ofself-respect and independence, and was not likely to submit tobrowbeating from anyone. He tried to be just in his treatment of thescholars under his charge, and if he ever failed, it was frommisunderstanding or ignorance, not from design. In the presentinstance he felt that he had done right, and resolved to maintain thejustice of his conduct.Nothing of importance occurred in the afternoon. Godfrey was veryquiet and orderly. He felt that he could afford to wait. Withmalicious joy, he looked forward to the scolding Mr. Stone was to getfrom his mother."He won't dare to talk to her," he said to himself. "I hope she'llmake him apologize to me. He ought to do it before the school."Evidently Godfrey had a very inadequate idea of the teacher's pluck,if he thought such a thing possible.School was dismissed, and Godfrey went home. He dropped a hint to BenTravers, that his mother was going "to haul Mr. Stone over the coals,"as he expressed it."Are you going to be there?" asked Ben, when Godfrey had finished."Yes," said Godfrey. "It'll be my turn then.""Perhaps Mr. Stone will have something to say," said Ben, doubtfully."He won't dare to," said Godfrey, confidently. "He knows my fathercould get him kicked out of school.""He's rather spunky, the master is," said Ben, who, toady as he was,understood the character of Mr. Stone considerably better than Godfreydid."I'll tell you all about it to-morrow morning," said Godfrey."All right.""I expect he'll apologize to me for what he did.""Maybe he will," answered Ben, but he thought it highly improbable."Did you give my note to Mr. Stone?" asked his mother."Yes.""What did he say?""He said he'd come around.""How did he appear?""He looked a little nervous," said Godfrey, speaking not according tofacts, but according to his wishes."I thought so," said Mrs. Preston, with a look of satisfaction. "Hewill find that he has made a mistake in treating you so outrageously.""Give it to him right and left, mother," said Godfrey, with more forcethan elegance."You might express yourself more properly, my son," said Mrs. Preston."I shall endeavor to impress upon his mind the impropriety of hisconduct."At half-past seven, Mr. Stone rang the bell at Mrs. Preston's door,and was ushered in without delay."Good-evening, Mrs. Preston," he said, bowing. "Your son brought me anote this afternoon, requesting me to call. I have complied with yourrequest.""Be seated, Mr. Stone," said the lady frigidly, not offering her hand."Thank you," said the teacher, with equal ceremony, and did asinvited."I suppose you can guess the object of my request," said Mrs. Preston."I think you stated it in your note.""I desire an explanation of the manner in which you treated my sonthis forenoon, Mr. Stone.""Pardon me, madam; your son is in the room.""Well, sir?""I decline discussing the matter before him.""I cannot understand why you should object to his presence.""I am his teacher, and he is subject to my authority. You apparentlydesire to find fault with the manner in which I have exercised thatauthority. It is improper that the discussion upon this point shouldtake place before him.""May I stay in the room, mother?" asked Godfrey, who was alarmed lesthe should miss the spectacle of Mr. Stone's humiliation."I really don't see why not," returned his mother."Madam," said Mr. Stone, rising, "I will bid you good-evening.""What, sir; before we have spoken on the subject?""I distinctly decline to speak before your son, for the reasonsalready given.""This is very singular, sir. However, I will humor your whims.Godfrey, you may leave the room.""Can't I stay?""I am compelled to send you out."Godfrey went out, though with a very ill grace."Now, madam," said the teacher, "I have no objection to telling youthat I first reprimanded your son for brutal treatment of a youngerschoolmate, and then forcibly carried him back to his seat, when heendeavored to leave the schoolroom without my permission."It was Mrs. Preston's turn to be surprised. She had expected tooverawe the teacher, and instead of that found him firmly andindependently defending his course."Mr. Stone," she said, "my son tells me that you praised an Irish boyin your school for a violent and brutal assault which he made uponhim.""I did not praise him for that. I praised him for promptly interferingto prevent Godfrey from abusing a boy smaller and younger thanhimself.""Godfrey had good cause for punishing the boy you refer to. He actedin self-defense.""He has doubtless misrepresented the affair to you, madam, as he didto me.""You take this Andrew Burke's word against his?""I form my judgment upon the testimony of an eyewitness, and from whatI know of your son's character.""From your own statement, this low Irish boy----""To whom do you refer, madam?""To the Irish boy.""I have yet to learn that he is low.""Do you mean to compare him with my son?""In wealth, no. Otherwise, you mustn't blame me for saying that I holdhim entirely equal in respectability, and in some important points hissuperior.""Really, sir, your language is most extraordinary."At this moment there was an interruption. Godfrey had been listeningat the keyhole, but finding that difficult, had opened the doorslightly, but in his interest managed to stumble against it. The doorflew open, and he fell forward upon his knees on the carpet of thesitting-room.CHAPTER XVMRS. PRESTON'S DISCOMFITUREGodfrey rose to his feet, red with mortification. His mother lookeddisconcerted. Mr. Stone said nothing, but glanced significantly fromGodfrey to Mrs. Preston."What is the matter, Godfrey?" she asked, rather sharply."It was an accident," said Godfrey, rather sheepishly."You can go out and shut the door, and take care not to let such anaccident happen again. For some unknown reason, Mr. Stone prefers thatyou should not be present, and, therefore, you must go."For once, Godfrey found nothing to say, but withdrew in silence."You appear to have formed a prejudice against Godfrey, Mr. Stone,"said Mrs. Preston."I may have formed an unfavorable judgment of him on some points,"said the teacher. "I judge of him by his conduct.""To say that Andrew Burke is his superior is insulting to him and hisfamily, as well as ludicrous.""I beg pardon, Mrs. Preston, but I must dissent from both yourstatements. Andrew Burke possesses some excellent qualities in whichGodfrey is deficient.""He is a poor working boy.""He is none the worse for that.""He should remember his position, and treat my son with properrespect.""I venture to say that Godfrey will receive all the respect to whichhe is entitled. May I ask if you expect him to be treated withdeference, because his father is richer than those of the other boys?""It seems to me only proper.""Do you expect me to treat him any better on that account?""I think my son's social position should command respect.""Then, Mrs. Preston, I entirely disagree with you," said Mr. Stone,firmly. "As a teacher, I have nothing whatever to do with the socialposition of the children who come to me as pupils. From me a poor boywill receive the same instruction, and the same treatment precisely asthe son of rich parents. If he behaves as he should, he will alwaysfind in me a friend, as well as a teacher. Your son Godfrey shall haveno just complaint to make of my treatment. I will give him credit forgood conduct and faithful study, but no more than to Andrew Burke, orto any other pupil under the same circumstances.""Mr. Stone, I am surprised at your singular style of talking. You wishto do away with all social distinctions.""I certainly do, madam, in my schoolroom, at least. There must besocial differences, I am aware. We cannot all be equally rich orhonored, but whatever may be the world's rule, I mean to maintainstrict impartiality in my schoolroom.""Will you require Andy Burke to apologize to Godfrey?""Why should I?""For his violent assault upon him.""Certainly not. He was justified in his conduct.""If my son was doing wrong, the Irish boy, instead of interfering,should have waited till you came, and then reported the matter toyou.""And, meanwhile, stood by and seen Alfred Parker inhumanly treated?""I presume the matter has been greatly exaggerated.""I do not, madam.""Do I understand that you decline to make reparation to my son?""Reparation for what?""For the manner in which he has been treated.""I must have talked to little purpose, if I have not made it clearthat your son has only received his deserts. Of course, he is entitledto no reparation, as you term it.""Then, Mr. Stone," said Mrs. Preston, her thin lips compressed withindignation, "since Godfrey cannot meet with fair treatment, I shallbe compelled to withdraw him from your school.""That must be as you please, madam," said the teacher, quite unmovedby the threatened withdrawal of his richest pupil."I shall report to Colonel Preston your treatment of his son.""I have no objection, madam.""You are pursuing a very unwise course in alienating your wealthiestpatrons.""I have no patrons, madam," said Mr. Stone, proudly. "I returnfaithful service for the moderate wages I receive, and the obligation,if there is any, is on the part of those whose children I instruct.""Really," thought Mrs. Preston, "this man is very independent for apoor teacher."She resolved upon another shot, not in the best of taste."You must not be surprised, Mr. Stone," she said, "if the schooltrustees refuse to employ you again.""You mistake me utterly," said the teacher, with dignity, "if yousuppose that any such threat or consideration will make me swerve frommy duty. However, though I did not propose to mention it, I will statethat this is the last term I shall teach in this village. I have beenengaged at double the salary in a neighboring city."Mrs. Preston was disappointed to hear this. It was certainly vexatiousthat the man who had treated her son with so little consideration, whohad actually taken the part of a working boy against him, should bepromoted to a better situation. She had thought to make him feel thathe was in her power, but she now saw that her anticipations were notto be realized.As she did not speak, Mr. Stone considered the interview closed, androse."Good-evening, Mrs. Preston," he said."Good-evening, sir," she responded, coldly.He bowed and withdrew.When Godfrey, who was not far off, though he had not thought it bestto play the part of eavesdropper again, heard the door close, hehurried into the room."Well, mother, what did he say?" he inquired, eagerly."He obstinately refused to make any reparation to you.""Did you tell him what you thought of his treatment of me?" saidGodfrey, rather surprised that his mother's remonstrance had producedno greater effect."Yes, I expressed my opinion very plainly. I must say that he's a veryimpudent man. The idea of a poor teacher putting on such airs!"continued Mrs. Preston, tossing her head."What did he say?""That that Irish boy was superior to you.""I'd like to knock him over," said Godfrey, wrathfully.Mrs. Preston was a lady, and it is not to be supposed that she shouldjoin in her son's wish. Still, it did not occur to her that she shouldmourn very much if Mr. Stone met with a reverse. She would like to seehis pride humbled, not reflecting that her own was greater and lessjustifiable."You ought to have told him that he would lose his school," saidGodfrey. "That would have frightened him, for he is a poor man, anddepends on the money he gets for teaching.""He is not going to teach here after this term.""Good! Did he tell you that?""Yes.""He is afraid of me, after all.""You are mistaken, Godfrey. He is offered considerably higher pay inanother place."Godfrey's countenance fell. It was as disagreeable to him as to hismother to learn that Mr. Stone was to be promoted in his profession."Shall I have to go to school again, mother?" he asked, after a pause."No," said Mrs. Preston, with energy. "Upon that I have determined.While Mr. Stone is teacher, you shall not go back. I will take care tolet it be known in the neighborhood why I keep you at home. I hope thenext teacher will be a man who understands the respect due to socialposition. I don't care to have you put on an equality with such boysas Andrew Burke. He is no fit associate for you.""That is what I think, mother," said Godfrey. "The low beggar! I'dlike to come up with him. Perhaps, I shall have a chance some day."When Colonel Preston returned home, the whole story was told to him;but, colored though it was, he guessed how matters actually stood, andwas far from becoming his son's partisan. He privately went to Mr.Stone and obtained his version of the affair."You did right, Mr. Stone," he said, at the end. "If my son chooses toact the bully, he must take the consequences. Mrs. Preston does notlook upon it in the same light, and insists upon my taking Godfreyfrom school. For the sake of peace, I must do so, but you must notconstrue it as showing any disapproval on my part of your course inthe matter.""Thank you, Colonel Preston," said the teacher, warmly. "I can onlyregret Mrs. Preston's displeasure. Your approval I highly value, andit will encourage me in the path of duty."CHAPTER XVITHE CHRISTMAS PRESENTGodfrey didn't return to school at all. He fancied that it would bemore aristocratic to go to a boarding school, and, his motherconcurring in this view, he was entered as a scholar at the MelvilleAcademy, situated in Melville, twelve miles distant. Once a fortnighthe came home to spend the Sunday. On these occasions he flourishedabout with a tiny cane, and put on more airs than ever. No one missedhim much, outside of his own family. Andy found the schoolconsiderably more agreeable after his departure.We will now suppose twelve months to have passed. During this timeAndy has grown considerably, and is now quite a stout boy. He hasimproved also in education. The Misses Grant, taking a kind interestin his progress, managed to spare him half the day in succeedingterms, so that he continued to attend school. Knowing that he had butthree hours to learn, when the others had six, he was all the morediligent, and was quite up to the average standard for boys of hisage. The fact is, Andy was an observing boy, and he realized thateducation was essential to success in life. Mr. Stone, before goingaway, talked with him on this subject and gave him some advice, whichAndy determined to follow.As may be inferred from what I have said, Andy was still working forthe Misses Grant. He had grown accustomed to their ways, and succeededin giving them perfect satisfaction, and accomplished quite as muchwork as John, his predecessor, though the latter was a man.As Christmas approached, Miss Priscilla said one day to her sister:"Don't you think, Sophia, it would be well to give Andrew a Christmaspresent?""Just so," returned Sophia, approvingly."He has been very faithful and obliging all the time he has been withus.""Just so.""I have been thinking what would be a good thing to give him.""A pair of spectacles," suggested Sophia, rather absent-mindedly."Sophia, you are a goose.""Just so," acquiesced her sister, meekly."Such a gift would be very inappropriate.""Just so.""A pair of boots," was the next suggestion."That would be better. Boots would be very useful, but I think itwould be well to give him something that would contribute to hisamusement. Of course, we must consult his taste, and not out own. Weare not boys.""Just so," said Sophia, promptly. "And he is not a lady," she added,enlarging upon the idea."Of course not. Now, the question is, what do boys like?""Just so," said Sophia, but this admission did not throw much lightupon the character of the present to be bought.Just then Andy himself helped them to a decision. He entered, cap inhand, and said:"If you can spare me, Miss Grant, I would like to go skating on thepond.""Have you a pair of skates, Andrew?""No, ma'am," said Andy; "but one of the boys will lend me a pair.""Yes, Andrew; you can go, if you will be home early.""Yes, ma'am--thank you."As he went out, Miss Priscilla said:"I have it.""What?" asked Sophia, alarmed."I mean that I have found out what to give to Andrew.""What is it?""A pair of skates.""Just so," said Sophia. "He will like them.""So I think. Suppose we go to the store while he is away, and buy hima pair.""Won't he need to try them on?" asked her sister."No," said Priscilla. "They don't need to fit as exactly as boots."So the two sisters made their way to the village store, and asked tolook at their stock of skates."Are you going to skate, Miss Priscilla?" asked the shopkeeper,jocosely."No; they are for Sophia," answered Priscilla, who could jokeoccasionally."Oh, Priscilla," answered the matter-of-fact Sophia, "you didn't tellme about that. I am sure I could not skate. You said they were forAndrew.""Sophia, you are a goose.""Just so.""It was only a joke.""Just so."The ladies, who never did things by halves, selected the best pair inthe store, and paid for them. When Andy had returned from skating,Priscilla said: "How did you like the skating, Andrew?""It was bully," said Andrew, enthusiastically."Whose skates did you borrow?""Alfred Parker's. They were too small for me, but I made them do.""I should suppose you would like to have a pair of your own.""So I should, but I can't afford to buy a pair, just yet."I'll tell you what I want to do, and maybe you'll help me aboutbuyin' it.""What is it, Andrew?""You know Christmas is comin', ma'am, and I want to buy my mother anice dress for a Christmas present--not a calico one, but a thick onefor winter.""Alpaca or de laine?""I expect so; I don't know the name of what I want, but you do. Howmuch would it cost?""I think you could get a good de laine for fifty cents a yard. I sawsome at the store this afternoon.""And about how many yards would be wanted, ma'am?""About twelve, I should think.""Then it would be six dollars.""Just so," said Sophia, who thought it about time she took part in theconversation."I've got the money, ma'am, and I'll give it to you, if you and MissSophia will be kind enough to buy it for me.""To be sure we will, Andrew," said Priscilla, kindly. "I am glad youare such a good son.""Just so, Andrew.""You see," said Andy, "mother won't buy anything for herself. Shealways wants to buy things for Mary and me. She wants us to bewell-dressed, but she goes with the same old clothes. So I want her tohave a new dress.""You want her to have it at Christmas, then?""Yes, ma'am, if it won't be too much trouble.""That is in two days. To-morrow, Sophia and I will buy the dress.""Thank you. Here's the money," and Andy counted out six dollars inbills, of which Miss Priscilla took charge.The next day they fulfilled their commission, and purchased a finedress pattern at the village store. It cost rather more than sixdollars, but this they paid out of their own pockets, and did notreport to Andy. Just after supper, as he was about to go home to spendChristmas Eve, they placed the bundle in his hands."Isn't it beautiful!" he exclaimed, with delight. "Won't mother beglad to get it?""She'll think she has a good son, Andrew.""Shure, I ought to be good to her, for she's a jewel of a mother.""That is right, Andrew. I always like to hear a boy speak well of hismother. It is a great pleasure to a mother to have a good son.""Shure, ma'am," said Andy, with more kindness of heart thandiscretion, "I hope you'll have one yourself.""Just so," said Sophia, with the forced habit upon her."Sophia, you are a goose!" said Priscilla, blushing a little."Just so, Priscilla.""We are too old to marry, Andrew," said Priscilla; "but we thank youfor your wish.""Shure, ma'am, you are only in the prime of life.""Just so," said Sophia, brightening up."I shall be sixty next spring. That can hardly be in the prime oflife.""I was readin' of a lady that got married at seventy-nine, ma'am.""Just so," said Sophia, eagerly.Miss Priscilla did not care to pursue the subject."We have thought of you," she continued, "and, as you have been veryobliging, we have bought you a Christmas present. Here it is."Andy no sooner saw the skates than his face brightened up with themost evident satisfaction."It's just what I wanted," he said, joyfully. "They're regularbeauties! I'm ever so much obliged to you.""Sophia wanted to get you a pair of spectacles, but I thought thesewould suit you better."Andy went off into a fit of laughter at the idea, in which both theladies joined him. Then, after thanking them again, he hurried home,hardly knowing which gave him greater pleasure, his own present, orhis mother's.I will not stop to describe Andy's Christmas, for this is only aretrospect, but carry my reader forward to the next September, whenAndy met with an adventure, which eventually had a considerable effectupon his fortunes.CHAPTER XVIIINTRODUCES AN ADVENTURERColonel Preston, as I have already said, was a rich man. He owned noreal estate in the town of Crampton, except the house in which helived. His property was chiefly in stocks of different kinds. Includedin these was a considerable amount of stock in a woolen manufacturingestablishment, situated in Melville, some twelve miles distant.Dividends upon these were paid semi-annually, on the first of Apriland October. It was the custom of Colonel Preston at these dates todrive over to Melville, receive his dividends, and then drive backagain.Now, unfortunately for the welfare of the community, there are somepersons who, unwilling to make a living by honest industry, prefer topossess themselves unlawfully of means to maintain their unprofitablelives. Among them was a certain black-whiskered individual, who,finding himself too well known in New York, had sought the country,ready for any stroke of business which might offer in his particularline. Chance led his steps to Melville, where he put up at the villageinn. He began at once to institute inquiries, the answers to whichmight serve his purpose, and to avert suspicion, casually mentionedthat he was a capitalist, and thought of settling down in the town. Ashe was well dressed, and had a plausible manner, this statement wasnot doubted.Among other things, he made inquiries in regard to the manufactory,what dividends it paid, and when. Expressing himself desirous ofpurchasing some stock, he inquired the names of the principal ownersof the stock. First among them was mentioned Colonel Preston."Perhaps he might sell some stocks," suggested the landlord."Where can I see him?" asked James Fairfax, for this was the nameassumed by the adventurer."You can see him here," answered the landlord, "in a day or two. Hewill be here the first of the month to receive his dividends.""Will he stop with you?""Probably. He generally dines with me when he comes over.""Will you introduce me?""With pleasure."Mr. Fairfax appeared to hear this with satisfaction, and said that hewould make Colonel Preston an offer for a part of his stock."Most of my property is invested in real estate in New York," he said;"but I should like to have some manufacturing stock; and, from whatyou tell me, I think favorably of the Melville Mills.""We should be glad to have you settle down among us," said thelandlord."I shall probably do so," said Fairfax. "I am very much pleased withyour town and people."In due time Colonel Preston drove over. As usual, he put up at thehotel."Colonel," said the landlord, "there's a gentleman stopping with mewho desires an introduction to you.""Indeed! What is his name?""James Fairfax.""Is he from this neighborhood?""No; from the city of New York.""I shall be happy to make his acquaintance," said the colonel,courteously; "but it must be after I return from the mills. I shall bethere a couple of hours, probably. We are to have a directorialmeeting.""I will tell him."Colonel Preston attended the directors' meeting, and also collectedhis dividend, amounting to eight hundred dollars. These, in eightone-hundred-dollar bills, he put in his pocketbook, and returned tothe hotel for dinner."Dinner is not quite ready, colonel," said the landlord. "It will beready in fifteen minutes.""Where is the gentleman who wished to be introduced to me?" askedColonel Preston, who thought it would save time to be introduced now."I will speak to him."He went directly to a dark-complexioned man with black whiskers, andeyes that were rather sinister in appearance. The eyes oftenest betraythe real character of a man, where all other signs fail. But ColonelPreston was not a keen observer, nor was he skilled in physiognomy,and, judging of Mr. Fairfax by his manner merely, was rather pleasedwith him."You will pardon my obtruding myself upon you, Colonel Preston," saidthe stranger, with great ease of manner."I am happy to make your acquaintance, sir.""I am a stranger in this neighborhood. The city of New York is myhome. I have been led here by the recommendations of friends who knewthat I desired to locate myself in the country.""How do you like Melville?""Very much--so much, that I may settle down here. But, ColonelPreston, I am a man of business, and if I am to be here, I want somelocal interest--some stake in the town itself.""Quite natural, sir.""You are a business man yourself, and will understand me. Now, to cometo the point, I find you have a manufactory here--a woolenmanufactory, which I am given to understand is prosperous andprofitable.""You are correctly informed, Mr. Fairfax. It is paying twelve percent. dividends, and has done so for several years.""That is excellent. It is a better rate than I get for most of my cityinvestments.""I also have city investments--bank stocks, and horse-railroad stocks,but, as you say, my mill stock pays me better than the majority ofthese.""You are a large owner of the mill stock; are you not, ColonelPreston?""Yes, sir; the largest, I believe.""So I am informed. Would you be willing to part with any of it?""I have never thought of doing so. I am afraid I could not replace itwith any other that would be satisfactory.""I don't blame you, of course, but it occurred to me that, having aconsiderable amount, you might be willing to sell.""I generally hold on to good stock when I get possession of it.Indeed, I would buy more, if there were any in the market.""He must have surplus funds," thought the adventurer. "I must see if Ican't manage to get some into my possession."Here the landlord appeared, and announced that dinner was ready."You dine here, then?" said Fairfax."Yes; it will take me two hours to reach home, so I am obliged to dinehere.""We shall dine together, it seems. I am glad of it, as at present Ihappen to be the only permanent guest at the hotel. May I ask whereyou live?""In Crampton.""I have heard favorably of it, and have been intending to come overand see the place, but the fact is, I am used only to the city, andyour country roads are so blind, that I have been afraid of losing myway.""Won't you ride over with me this afternoon, Mr. Fairfax? I can'tbring you back, but you are quite welcome to a seat in my chaise oneway."The eyes of the adventurer sparkled at the invitation. Colonel Prestonhad fallen into the trap he had laid for him, but he thought it bestnot to accept too eagerly."You are certainly very kind, Colonel Preston," he answered, withaffected hesitation, "but I am afraid I shall be troubling you toomuch.""No trouble whatever," said Colonel Preston, heartily. "It is a lonelyride, and I shall be glad of a companion.""A lonely ride, is it?" thought Fairfax. "All the better for mypurpose. It shall not be my fault if I do not come back with mypockets well lined. The dividends you have just collected will bebetter in my pockets than in yours."This was what he thought, but he said:"Then I will accept with pleasure. I suppose I can easily engagesomeone to bring me back to Melville?""Oh, yes; we have a livery stable, where you can easily obtain a horseand driver."The dinner proceeded, and Fairfax made himself unusually social andagreeable, so that Colonel Preston congratulated himself on theprospect of beguiling the loneliness of the way in such pleasantcompany. Fairfax spoke of stocks with such apparent knowledge that thecolonel imagined him to be a gentleman of large property. It is notsurprising that he was deceived, for the adventurer really understoodthe subject of which he spoke, having been for several years a clerkin a broker's counting-room in Wall Street. The loss of his situationwas occasioned by his abstraction of some securities, part of which hehad disposed of before he was detected. He was, in consequence, triedand sentenced to three years' imprisonment. At the end of this periodhe was released, with no further taste for an honest life, and hadsince allied himself to the class who thrive by preying upon thecommunity.This was the man whom Colonel Preston proposed to take as hiscompanion on his otherwise lonely ride home.CHAPTER XVIIIRIDING WITH A HIGHWAYMAN"Get into the chaise, Mr. Fairfax," said Colonel Preston."Thank you," said the adventurer, and accepted the invitation."Now we are off," said the colonel, as he took the reins, and touchedthe horse lightly with the whip."Is the road a pleasant one?" inquired Fairfax."The latter part is rather lonely. For a mile it runs through thewoods--still, on a summer day, that is rather pleasant than otherwise.In the evening, it is not so agreeable.""No, I suppose not," said Fairfax, rather absently.Colonel Preston would have been startled could he have read thethoughts that were passing through the mind of his companion. Could hehave known his sinister designs, he would scarcely have sat at hisside, chatting so easily and indifferently."I will postpone my plan till we get to that part of the road hespeaks of," thought Fairfax. "It would not do for me to beinterrupted.""I suppose it is quite safe traveling anywhere on the road," remarkedthe adventurer."Oh, yes," said Colonel Preston, with a laugh. "Thieves and highwayrobbers do not pay us the compliment of visiting our neighborhood.They keep in the large cities, or in places that will better rewardtheir efforts.""Precisely," said Fairfax; "I am glad to hear it, for I carry aconsiderable amount of money about me.""So do I, to-day. This is the day for payment of mill dividends, andas I have occasion to use the money, I did not deposit it.""Good," said Fairfax, to himself. "That is what I wanted to find out."Aloud he said:"Oh, well, there are two of us, so it would be a bold highwayman thatwould venture to attack us. Do you carry a pistol?""Not I," said Colonel Preston. "I don't like the idea of carryingfirearms about with me. They might go off by mistake. I was reading ina daily paper, recently, of a case where a man accidentally shot hisson with the pistol he was in the habit of carrying about with him.""There is that disadvantage, to be sure," said Fairfax. "So, he has nopistol. He is quite in my power," he said to himself. "It's a goodthing to know.""By the way," he asked, merely to keep up the conversation, "are you afamily man, Colonel Preston?""Yes, sir; I have a wife, and a son of fifteen.""You have the advantage of me in that respect. I have always beendevoted to business, and have had no time for matrimony.""Time enough yet, Mr. Fairfax.""Oh, yes, I suppose so.""If you are going to settle down in our neighborhood, I can introduceyou to some of our marriageable young ladies," said Colonel Preston,pleasantly."Thank you," said Fairfax; in the same tone. "I may avail myself ofyour offer.""Won't you take supper at my home this evening?" said the colonel,hospitably. "I shall be glad to introduce Mrs. Preston. My son is atboarding school, so I shall not be able to let you see him.""Have you but one child, then?""But one. His absence leaves us alone."Godfrey's absence would have been lamented more by his father, had hischaracter and disposition been different. But he was so arrogant andoverbearing in his manners, and so selfish, that his father hoped thatassociation with other boys would cure him in part of theseobjectionable traits. At home, he was so much indulged by his mother,who could see no fault in him, as long as he did not oppose her, thatthere was little chance of amendment.So they rode on, conversing on various topics, but their conversationwas not of sufficient importance for me to report. At length theyentered on a portion of the road lined on either side by a naturalforest. Fairfax looked about him."I suppose, Colonel Preston, these are the woods you referred to?""Yes, sir.""How far do they extend?""About a mile."They had traversed about half a mile, when Fairfax said:"If you don't object, Colonel Preston, I will step out a moment.There's a tree with a peculiar leaf. I would like to examine it nearerto.""Certainly, Mr. Fairfax," said the colonel, though he wondered whattree it could be, for he saw no tree of an unusual character.The chaise stopped and Fairfax jumped off. But he seemed to haveforgotten the object of dismounting. Instead of examining the foliageof a tree, he stepped to the horse's head, and seized him by thebridle."What are you going to do, Mr. Fairfax?" asked Colonel Preston, insurprise.By this time Fairfax had withdrawn a pistol from his inside pocket,and deliberately pointed it at his companion."Good heavens! Mr. Fairfax, what do you mean?""Colonel Preston," said the adventurer, "I want all the money you haveabout you. I know you have a considerable sum, for you have yourselfacknowledged it.""Why," exclaimed Colonel Preston, startled, "this is highway robbery.""Precisely!" said Fairfax, bowing mockingly. "You have had the honorof riding with a highwayman. Will you be good enough to give me themoney at once? I am in haste.""Surely, this is a joke, Mr. Fairfax. I have heard of such practicaljokes before. You are testing my courage. I am not in the leastfrightened. Jump in the chaise again, and we will proceed.""That's a very kind way of putting it," said Fairfax, coolly; "but notcorrect. I am no counterfeit, but the genuine article. Fairfax is notmy name. I won't tell you what it is, for it might be inconvenient."No man can look with equanimity upon the prospect of losing money, andColonel Preston may be excused for not wishing to part with his eighthundred dollars. But how could he escape? He had no pistol, andFairfax held the horse's bridle in a strong grasp. If he could onlyparley with him till some carriage should come up, he might save hismoney. It seemed the only way, and he resolved to try it."Mr. Fairfax," he said, "if you are really what you represent, I hopeyou will consider the natural end of such a career. Turn, I entreatyou, to a more honest course of life.""That may come some time," said Fairfax; "but at present mynecessities are too great. Oblige me by producing your pocketbook.""I will give you one hundred dollars, and keep the matter a secretfrom all. That will be better than to expose yourself to the penaltyof the law.""Colonel Preston, a hundred dollars will not satisfy me. You haveeight hundred dollars with you, and I shall not leave this spot tillit is transferred to my possession.""If I refuse?""You will subject me to the unpleasant alternative of blowing yourbrains out," said the other, coolly."You surely would not be guilty of such a crime, Mr. Fairfax?" saidColonel Preston, with a shudder."I would rather not. I have no desire to take your life, but I musthave that money. If you prefer to keep your money, you will compel meto the act. You'll gain nothing, for in that case I shall takeboth--your life first, and your money afterward.""And this is the man with whom I dined, and with whom, a few momentssince, I was conversing freely!" thought Colonel Preston.The adventurer became impatient."Colonel Preston," he said, abruptly, "produce that money instantly,or I will fire."There was no alternative. With reluctant hand the colonel drew out hispocketbook, and was about to hand it with its contents to thehighwayman, when there was a sudden crash in the bushes behindFairfax, his pistol was dashed from his hand, and our young hero, AndyBurke, with resolute face, stood with his gun leveled at him. Allhappened so quickly that both Colonel Preston and Fairfax were takenby surprise, and the latter, still retaining his hold upon the bridle,stared at the young hero, who had so intrepidly come between him andhis intended victim.With an oath he stopped, and was about to pick up the pistol which hadfallen from his hands, but was arrested by the quick, decisive tonesof Andy:"Let that pistol alone! If you pick it up, I will shoot you on thespot."CHAPTER XIXBAFFLED A ROBBERFairfax paused at Andy's threat. He was only a boy, it is true, but helooked cool and resolute, and the gun, which was pointed at him,looked positively dangerous. But was he to be thwarted in the verymoment of his triumph, by a boy? He could not endure it."Young man," he said, "this is dangerous business for you. If youdon't make yourself scarce, you won't be likely to return at all.""I'll take the risk," said Andy, coolly."Confound him! I thought he'd be frightened," said Fairfax to himself."I don't want to kill you," he said, with a further attempt tointimidate Andy."I don't mean to let you," said our hero, quietly."You are no match for me.""With a gun I am.""I don't believe it is loaded.""If you try to pick up that pistol, I'll convince you; by the powers,I will," said Andy, energetically."What is to prevent my taking away the gun from you?""Faith," returned Andy, quaintly, "you'll take the powder and ballfirst, I'm thinkin'."Fairfax thought so, too, and that was one reason why he concluded notto try it.It was certainly a provoking position for him.There lay the pistol on the ground, just at his feet; yet, if he triedto pick it up, the boy would put a bullet through him. It wasfurthermore provoking to reflect that, had he not stopped to parleywith Colonel Preston, he might have secured the money, which he somuch desired, before Andy had come up. There was one other resource.He had tried bullying, and without success. He would try cajoling andtemptation."Look here, boy," he said, "I am a desperate man. I would as leavemurder you as not.""Thank you," said Andy. "But I'd rather not have it done.""I don't want to hurt you, as I said before, but you mustn't interferewith me.""Then you mustn't interfere with the colonel.""I must have the money in his pocketbook.""Must you? Maybe, I'll have something to say, to that.""He has eight hundred dollars with him.""Did he tell you?""No matter; I know. If you won't interfere with me, I'll give you twohundred of it.""Thank you for nothing, then," said Andy, independently. "I'm only apoor Irish boy, but I ain't a thafe, and never mane to be.""Bravo, Andy!" said Colonel Preston, who had awaited with a littleanxiety the result of the offer.Fairfax stooped suddenly, but before he could get hold of the pistol,Andy struck him on the head with the gun-barrel, causing him to rollover, while, in a quick and adroit movement, he himself got hold ofthe pistol before Fairfax had recovered from the crack on his head."Now," said Andy, triumphantly, with the gun over his shoulder, andpresenting the pistol, "lave here mighty quick, or I'll shoot ye.""Give me back the pistol, then," said the discomfited ruffian."I guess not," said Andy."It's my property.""I don't know that. Maybe you took it from some thraveler.""Give it to me, and I'll go off peaceably.""I won't take no robber's word," said Andy. "Are you goin'?""Give me the pistol. Fire it off, if you like.""That you may load it again. You don't catch a weasel asleep,"answered Andy, shrewdly. "I've a great mind to make you march into thevillage, and give you up to the perlice."This suggestion was by no means pleasant for the highwayman,particularly as he reflected that Andy had shown himself a resoluteboy, and doubly armed as he now was, it was quite within his power tocarry out his threat."Don't fire after me," he said."I never attack an inimy in the rare," said Andy, who always indulgedin the brogue more than usual under exciting circumstances.I make this explanation, as the reader may have noticed a differencein his dialect at different times."We shall meet again, boy!" said Fairfax, menacingly, turning at thedistance of a few feet."Thank you, sir. You needn't thrubble yourself," said Andy, "I ain'tanxious to mate you.""When we do meet, you'll know it," said the other."Maybe I will. Go along wid ye!" said Andy, pointing the pistol athim."Don't shoot," said Fairfax, hastily, and he quickened his pace to getout of the way of a dangerous companion.Andy laughed as the highwayman disappeared in the distance."I thought he wouldn't wait long," he said."Andy," said Colonel Preston, warmly, "you have behaved like a hero.""I'm only an Irish boy," said Andy, laughing. "Shure, they don't makeheroes of such as I.""I don't care whether you are Irish or Dutch. You are a hero for allthat.""Shure, sir, it's lucky I was round whin that spalpeen wanted to robyou.""How did you happen to be out with a gun this afternoon?""I got my work all done, and Miss Grant said I might go out shootin'if I wanted. Shure, I didn't expect it 'ud been robbers I would beafther shootin'.""You came up just in the nick of time. Weren't you afraid?""I didn't stop to think of that when I saw that big blackguardp'intin' his pistol at you. I thought I'd have a hand in it myself.""Jump into the chaise, Andy, and ride home with me.""What, wid the gun?""To be sure. We won't leave the gun. That has done us too good servicealready to-day.""I've made something out of it, anyway," said Andy, displaying thepistol, which was silver-mounted, and altogether a very pretty weapon."It's a regular beauty," he said, with admiration."It will be better in your hands than in the real owner's," saidColonel Preston.By this time Andy was in the chaise, rapidly nearing the village."If you hadn't come up just as you did, Andy, I should have beenpoorer by eight hundred dollars.""That's a big pile of money," said Andy, who, as we know, was not inthe habit of having large sums of money in his own possession."It is considerably more than I would like to lose," said ColonelPreston, to whom it was of less importance than to Andy."I wonder will I ever have so much money?" thought Andy."Now, I'll tell you what I think it only right to do, Andy," pursuedthe colonel.Andy listened attentively."I am going to make you a present of some money, as an acknowledgmentof the service you have done me.""I don't want anything, Colonel Preston," said Andy. "I didn't helpyou for the money.""I know you didn't, my lad," said the colonel, "but I mean to give itto you all the same."He took out his pocketbook, but Andy made one more remonstrance."I don't think I ought to take it, sir, thankin' you all the same.""Then I will give you one hundred dollars for your mother. You can'trefuse it for her."Andy's eyes danced with delight. He knew how much good this moneywould do his mother, and relieve her from the necessity of working sohard as she was now compelled to do."Thank you, sir," he said. "It'll make my mother's heart glad, andsave her from the hard work.""Here is the money, Andy," said the colonel, handing his youngcompanion a roll of bills.Again Andy poured out warm protestations of gratitude for themunificent gift, with which Colonel Preston was well pleased."I believe you are a good boy, Andy," he said. "It is a good sign whena boy thinks so much of his mother.""I'd be ashamed not to, sir," said Andy.They soon reached the village. Andy got down at the Misses Grant'sgate, and was soon astonishing the simple ladies by a narrative of hisencounter with the highwayman."Do you think he'll come here?" asked Sophia, in alarm. "If he shouldcome when Andy was away----""You could fire the gun yourself, Sophia.""I should be frightened to death.""Then he couldn't kill you afterward.""Just so," answered Sophia, a little bewildered."Were you shot, Andrew?" she asked, a minute afterward."If I was, I didn't feel it," said Andy, jocosely.Andy's heroic achievement made him still more valued by the MissesGrant, and they rejoiced in the handsome gift he had received from thecolonel, and readily gave him permission to carry it to his motherafter supper.CHAPTER XXHOW THE NEWS WAS RECEIVEDIt is always pleasant to carry good news, and Andy hastened withjoyful feet to his mother's humble dwelling."Why, Andy, you're out of breath. What's happened?" asked Mrs. Burke."I was afraid of bein' robbed," said Andy."The robber wouldn't get much that would steal from you, Andy.""I don't know that, mother. I ain't so poor as you think. Look there,now!"Here he displayed the roll of bills. There were twenty fives, whichmade quite a thick roll."Where did you get so much, Andy?" asked his sister Mary."How much is it?" asked his mother."A hundred dollars," answered Andy, proudly."A hundred dollars!" repeated his mother, with apprehension. "Oh,Andy, I hope you haven't been stealing?""Did you ever know me to stale, mother?" said Andy."No, but I thought you might be tempted. Whose money is it?""It's yours, mother.""Mine!" exclaimed Mrs. Burke, in astonishment. "You're joking now,Andy.""No, I'm not. It's yours.""Where did it come from, then?""Colonel Preston sent it to you as a present.""I am afraid you are not tellin' me the truth, Andy," said his mother,doubtfully. "Why should he send me so much money?""Listen, and I'll tell you, mother, and you'll see it's the truth I'vebeen tellin'."Thereupon he told the story of his adventure with the highwayman andhow he had saved Colonel Preston from being robbed.His mother listened with pride, for though Andy spoke modestly, shecould see that he had acted in a brave and manly way, and it made herproud of him."So the colonel," Andy concluded, "wanted to give me a hundreddollars, but I didn't like to take it myself. But when he said hewould give it to you, I couldn't say anything ag'inst that. So here itis, mother, and I hope you'll spend some of it on yourself.""I don't feel as if it belonged to me, Andy. It was you that he meantit for.""Keep it, mother, and it'll do to use when we nade it.""I don't like to keep so much money in the house, Andy. We might berobbed.""You can put part of it in the savings bank, mother."This course was adopted, and Andy himself carried eighty dollars, anddeposited it in a savings bank in Melville, a few days afterward.Meanwhile Colonel Preston told the story of Andy's prowess, at home.But Mrs. Preston was prejudiced against Andy, and listened coldly."It seems to me, Colonel Preston," she said, "you are makingaltogether too much of that Irish boy. He puts on enough airs to makeone sick already.""I never observed it, my dear," said the colonel, mildly."Everyone else does. He thought himself on a level with our Godfrey.""He is Godfrey's superior in some respects.""Oh, well, if you are going to exalt him above your own flesh andblood, I won't stay and listen to you.""You disturb yourself unnecessarily, my dear. I have no intention ofadopting him in place of my son. But he has done me a great servicethis after-noon, and displayed a coolness and courage very unusual ina boy of his age. But for him, I should be eight hundred dollarspoorer.""Oh, well, you can give him fifty cents, and he will be well paid forhis services, as you call them.""Fifty cents!" repeated her husband."Well, a dollar, if you like.""I have given him a hundred dollars.""A hundred dollars!" almost screamed Mrs. Preston, who was a very meanwoman. "Are you insane?""Not that I am aware of, my dear.""It is perfectly preposterous to give such a sum to such a boy.""I ought to say that I gave it to him for his mother. He was notwilling to accept it for himself.""That's a likely story," said Mrs. Preston, incredulously. "He onlywants to make a favorable impression upon you--perhaps to get more outof you.""You misjudge him, my dear.""I know he is an artful, intriguing young rascal. You give him ahundred dollars, yet you refused to give Godfrey ten dollars lastweek.""For a very good reason. He has a liberal allowance, and must keepwithin it. He did not need the money he asked for.""Yet you lavish a hundred dollars on this boy.""I felt justified in doing so. Which was better, to give him that sum,or to lose eight hundred?""I don't like the boy, and I never shall. I suppose he will bestrutting around, boasting of his great achievement. If he had a gunit was nothing to do.""I suspect Godfrey would hardly have ventured upon it," said thecolonel, smiling."Oh, of course, Godfrey is vastly inferior to the Irish boy!" remarkedMrs. Preston, ironically. "You admire the family so much that Isuppose if I were taken away, you would marry his mother and establishher in my place.""If you have any such apprehensions, my dear, your best course is tooutlive her. That will effectually prevent my marrying her, and Ipledge you my word that, while you are alive, I shall not think ofeloping with her.""It is very well to jest about it," said Mrs. Preston, tossing herhead."I am precisely of your opinion, my dear. As you observe, that isprecisely what I am doing."So the interview terminated. It was very provoking to Mrs. Prestonthat her husband should have given away a hundred dollars to AndyBurke's mother, but the thing was done, and could not be undone.However, she wrote an account of the affair to Godfrey, who, she knew,would sympathize fully with her view of the case. I give some extractsfrom her letter:"Your father seems perfectly infatuated with that low Irish boy. Ofcourse, I allude to Andy Burke. He has gone so far as to give him ahundred dollars. Yesterday, in riding home from Melville, with eighthundred dollars in his pocketbook, he says he was stopped by ahighwayman, who demanded his money or his life. Very singularly, Andycame up just in the nick of time with a gun, and made a great show ofinterfering, and finally drove the man away, as your father reports.He is full of praise of Andy, and, as I said, gave him a hundreddollars, when two or three would have been quite enough, even had therescue been real. But of this I have my doubts. It is very strangethat the boy should have been on the spot just at the right time,still more strange that a full-grown man should have been frightenedaway by a boy of fifteen. In fact, I think it is what they call a'put-up job.' I think the robber and Andy were confederates, and thatthe whole thing was cut and dried, that the man should make theattack, and Andy should appear and frighten him away, for the sake ofa reward which I dare say the two have shared together. This is what Ithink about the matter. I haven't said so to your father, because heis so infatuated with the Irish boy that it would only make him angry,but I have no doubt that you will agree with me. [It may be said herethat Godfrey eagerly adopted his mother's view, and was equallyprovoked at his father's liberality to his young enemy.] Your fathersays he won't give you the ten dollars you asked for. He can lavish ahundred dollars on Andy, but he has no money to give his own son. Butsooner or later that boy will be come up with--sooner or later he willshow himself in his true colors, and your father will be obliged toconfess that he has been deceived. It puts me out of patience when Ithink of him."We shall expect you home on Friday afternoon of next week, as usual."Andy was quite unconscious of the large space which he occupied in thethoughts of Mrs. Preston and Godfrey, and of the extent to which hetroubled them. He went on, trying to do his duty, and succeeding fullyin satisfying the Misses Grant, who had come to feel a strong interestin his welfare.Three weeks later, Sophia Grant, who had been to the village store onan errand, returned home, looking greatly alarmed."What is the matter, Sophia?" asked her sister. "You look as if youhad seen a ghost.""Just so, Priscilla," she said; "no, I don't mean that, but we may allbe ghosts in a short time.""What do you mean?""Smallpox is in town!""Who's got it?""Colonel Preston; and his wife won't stay in the house. She is packingup to go off, and I expect the poor man'll die all by himself, unlesssomebody goes and takes care of him, and then it'll spread, and we'llall die of it."This was certainly startling intelligence. Andy pitied the colonel,who had always treated him well. It occurred to him that his motherhad passed through an attack of smallpox in her youth, and could takecare of the colonel without danger. He resolved to consult her aboutit at once.CHAPTER XXIA MODEL WIFEColonel Preston, returning from a trip to Boston, in which, probably,he had been unconsciously exposed to the terrible disease referred to,was taken sick, and his wife, wholly unsuspicious of her husband'smalady, sent for the doctor.The latter examined his patient and, on leaving the sick-chamber,beckoned Mrs. Preston to follow him."What is the matter with him, doctor?" asked Mrs. Preston. Thephysician looked grave."I regret to say, Mrs. Preston, that he has the smallpox.""The smallpox!" almost shrieked Mrs. Preston. "Oh! what will become ofme?"Dr. Townley was rather disgusted to find her first thought was aboutherself, not about her stricken husband."It's catching, isn't it, doctor?" she asked, in great agitation."I am sorry to say that it is, madam.""Do you think I will take it?""I cannot take it upon myself to say.""And I was in the same room with him," wailed Mrs. Preston, "and neverknew the awful danger! Oh, I wouldn't have the smallpox for thisworld! If I didn't die, I should be all marked up for life.""You haven't much beauty to spoil," thought the doctor; but thisthought he prudently kept to himself."I must leave the house at once. I will go to my brother's house tillhe has recovered," said Mrs. Preston, in agitation."What!" exclaimed the doctor, in surprise, "and leave your husbandalone!""I can't take care of him--you must see that I can't," said Mrs.Preston, fretfully. "I can't expose my life without doing him anygood.""I expose myself every time I visit him," said the doctor. "I neverhad the smallpox. Have you been vaccinated?""Yes, I believe so--I'm sure I don't know. But people sometimes takethe smallpox even after they have been vaccinated. I should be sofrightened that I could do no good.""Then," said the doctor, gravely, "you have decided to leave yourhusband?""Yes, doctor, I must. It is my duty--to my boy," answered Mrs.Preston, catching at this excuse with eagerness. "I must live for him,you know. Of course, if I could do any good, it would be different.But what would Godfrey do if both his father and mother should die?"She looked up into his face, hoping that he would express approval ofher intentions; but the doctor was too honest for this. In truth, hewas disgusted with the woman's selfishness, and would like to havesaid so; but this politeness forbade. At any rate, he was not going tobe trapped into any approval of her selfish and cowardlydetermination."What do you wish to be done, Mrs. Preston?" he asked. "Of course,your husband must be taken care of.""Hire a nurse, doctor. A nurse will do much more good than I could.She will know just what to do. Most of them have had the smallpox. Itis really much better for my husband that it should be so. Of course,you can pay high wages--anything she asks," added Mrs. Preston, whosegreat fear made her, for once in her life, liberal."I suppose that will be the best thing to do. You wish me, then, toengage a nurse?""Yes, doctor, if you will be so kind.""When do you go away?""At once. I shall pack up my clothes immediately. On the whole, Ithink I will go to the town where Godfrey is at school, and boardthere for the present. I must see him, and prevent him from cominghome.""You will go into your husband's chamber and bid him good-by?""No; I cannot think of it. It would only be useless exposure.""What will he think?""Explain it to him, doctor. Tell him that I hope he will get well verysoon, and that I feel it my duty to go away now on Godfrey's account.I am sure he will see that it is my duty.""I wonder what excuse she would have if she had no son for a pretext?"thought the doctor."Well," he said, "I will do as you request.""See that he has the best of care. Get him two nurses, if you thinkbest. Don't spare expense.""What extraordinary liberality in Mrs. Preston," thought thephysician.He went back into the chamber of his patient."Doctor," said Colonel Preston, "you didn't tell me what was thematter with me. Am I seriously sick?""I am sorry to say that you are.""Dangerously?""Not necessarily. You have the smallpox.""Have I?" said the patient, thoughtfully."It's an awkward thing to tell him that his wife is going to leavehim," the doctor said to himself. "However, it must be done.""Have you told my wife, doctor?""I just told her.""What does she say?""She is very much startled, and (now for it), thinks, under thecircumstances, she ought not to run the risk of taking care of you onaccount of Godfrey.""Perhaps she is right," said Colonel Preston, slowly.He was not surprised to hear it, but it gave him a pang, nevertheless."She wants me to engage a nurse for you.""Yes, that will be necessary."There was a pause."When is she going?" he asked, a little later."As soon as possible. She is going to board near the school whereGodfrey is placed.""Shall I see her?""She thinks it best not to risk coming into the chamber, lest sheshould carry the infection to Godfrey.""I suppose that is only prudent," returned the sick man, but in hisheart he wished that his wife had shown less prudence, and a littlemore feeling for him."Have you thought of any nurse?" he asked."I have thought of the widow Burke.""She might not dare to come.""She has had the disease. I know this from a few slight marks stillleft on her face. Of course, you would be willing to pay a liberalprice?""Any price," said Colonel Preston, energetically. "It is a servicewhich, I assure you, I shall not soon forget.""I must see her at once, for your wife will leave directly.""Pray, do so," said Colonel Preston. "Tell my wife," he said, after apause, "that I hope soon to have recovered, so that it may be safe forher to come back."There was a subdued bitterness in his voice, which the doctordetected, and did not wonder at. He gave the message, as requested."I am sure I hope so, Dr. Townley," said Mrs. Preston. "I shall betortured with anxiety. I hope you will write me daily how my poorhusband is getting along?""Perhaps the paper might carry the infection," said the doctor,testing the real extent of her solicitude."I didn't think of that," answered Mrs. Preston, hastily. "On thewhole, you needn't write, then. It might communicate the disease toGodfrey.""She finds Godfrey very useful," the doctor thought."I will bear my anxiety as I can," she continued. "Have you thought ofanyone for a nurse?""I have thought of Mrs. Burke.""She is poor, and will come if you offer her a good price. Try to gether.""I think she will come. I must go at once, for your husband needsimmediate attention.""Get her to come at once, Dr. Townley! Oh, do! My husband may wantsomething, and I can't go into the room. My duty to my dear, only sonwill not permit me. I hope Mr. Preston understands my motives in goingaway?""I presume he does," said the doctor, rather equivocally."Tell him how great a sacrifice it is for me to leave his bedside. Itis a terrible trial for me, but my duty to my son makes itimperative."The doctor bowed.He drove at once to the humble dwelling of Mrs. Burke.His errand was briefly explained."Can you come?" he asked. "I am authorized to offer you ten dollars aweek for the time you spend there.""I would come in a minute, doctor, but what shall I do with Mary?""She shall stay at my house. I will gladly take charge of her.""You are very kind, doctor. I wouldn't want to expose her, but I don'tmind myself. I don't think I am in danger, for I've had the smallpoxalready.""Can you be ready in five minutes? Tell Mary to pack up her things,and go to my house at once. We'll take good care of her."In less than an hour Mrs. Burke was installed at the bedside of thesick man as his nurse. As she entered the house, Mrs. Preston left it,bound for the railway depot."I'm so glad you're here," she said, greeting the widow Burke withunwonted cordiality. "I am sure you will take the best care of myhusband. I have told the doctor to pay you whatever you ask.""I'll do my best, Mrs. Preston, but not for the money," answered Mrs.Burke. "Your husband shall get well, if good care can cure him.""I've no doubt of it; but the carriage is here, and I must go. Tell myhusband how sorry I am to leave him."So Mrs. Preston went away, leaving a stranger to fulfill her ownduties at the bedside of her husband.Thus it happened that, when Andy came home, he found his motheralready gone, and his sister on the point of starting for the doctor'shouse. His idea had already been carried out.CHAPTER XXIICOLONEL PRESTON'S RECOVERYFour weeks afterward, we will introduce the reader into the bedchamberof Colonel Preston. His sickness has been severe. At times recoverywas doubtful, but Mrs. Burke has proved a careful and devoted nurse,intelligent and faithful enough to carry out the directions of thephysician."How do you feel this morning, Colonel Preston?" asked the doctor, whohad just entered the chamber."Better, doctor. I feel quite an appetite.""You are looking better--decidedly better. The disease has spent itsforce, and retreated from the field.""It is to you that the credit belongs, Dr. Townley.""Only in part. The greater share belongs to your faithful nurse, Mrs.Burke.""I shall not soon forget my obligations to her," said the sick man,significantly."Now, Colonel Preston," said Mrs. Burke, "you are making too much ofwhat little I have done.""That is impossible, Mrs. Burke. It is to your good nursing and thedoctor's skill that I owe my life, and I hardly know to which themost.""To the doctor, sir. I only followed out his directions.""At the expense of your own health. You show the effects of yourlong-continued care.""It won't take long to pick up," said Mrs. Burke, cheerfully."Is the danger of contagion over, doctor?" asked the patient."Quite so.""Then, would it not be well to write to Mrs. Preston? Not that I meanto give up my good nurse just yet; that is, if she is willing tostay.""I will stay as long as you need me, sir.""That is well; but Mrs. Preston may wish to return, now that there'sno further danger.""I will write to her at once.""Thank you."The following letter was dispatched to Mrs. Preston:    "MRS. PRESTON:--    "Dear Madam: It gives me great pleasure to inform you that    your husband is so far recovered that there is no danger now    of infection. You can return with safety, and he will,    doubtless, be glad to see you. He has been very ill,    indeed--in danger of his life; but, thanks to the devotion of    Mrs. Burke, who has proved an admirable nurse, he is now on    the high road to recovery. Yours respectfully,                                       "John Townley.""I think that will bring her," said the doctor.But he reckoned without his host.The next day he received the following letter, on scented paper:    "MY DEAR DOCTOR TOWNLEY: You cannot think how rejoiced I am    to receive the tidings of my husband's convalescence. I have    been so tortured with anxiety during the last four weeks! You    cannot think how wretchedly anxious I have been. I could not    have endured to stay away from his bedside but that my duty    imperatively required it. I have lost flesh, and my anxiety    has worn upon me. Now, how gladly will I resume my place at    the bedside of my husband, restored by your skill. I am glad    the nurse has proved faithful. It was a good chance for her,    for she shall be liberally paid, and no doubt the money will    be welcome. But don't you think it might be more prudent for    me to defer my return until next week? It will be safer, I    think, and I owe it to my boy to be very careful. You know,    the contagion may still exist. It is hard for me to remain    longer away, when I would fain fly to the bedside of Mr.    Preston, but I feel that it is best. Say to him, with my    love, that he may expect me next week. Accept my thanks for    your attention to him. I shall never forget it; and believe    me to be, my dear doctor, your obliged                                       "Lucinda Preston."Dr. Townley threw down this letter with deep disgust."Was ever any woman more disgustingly selfish?" he exclaimed. "Herhusband might have died, so far as she was concerned."Of course, he had to show this letter to Colonel Preston.The latter read it, with grave face, and the doctor thought he heard asigh."My wife is very prudent," he said, with a touch of bitterness in hisvoice."She will be here next week," said the doctor, having nothing else toanswer."I think she will run no risk then," said the sick man, cynically.But Mrs. Preston did not return in a week. It was a full week and ahalf before she arrived at her own house.The doctor was just coming out of the front door."How is my husband?" she asked."Not far from well. He is still weak, of course.""And are you sure," she said, anxiously, "that there is no danger ofinfection?""Not the slightest, madam," said Dr. Townley, coldly."I am so glad I can see him once more. You cannot imagine," sheexclaimed, clasping her hands, "how much I have suffered in mysuspense!"The doctor remained cool and unmoved. He didn't feel that he couldrespond fittingly, being absolutely incredulous.Mrs. Preston saw it, and was nettled. She knew that she was ahypocrite, but did not like to have the doctor, by his silence, implyhis own conviction of it."Mine has been a hard position," she continued."Your husband has not had an easy time," said the doctor,significantly."But he has had good care--Mrs. Burke was a good nurse?""Admirable.""She must be paid well.""I offered her ten dollars a week.""Humph!" said Mrs. Preston, doubtfully, in whose eyes five dollarswould have been liberal compensation. "It has been a good chance forher.""It is far from adequate," said the doctor, disgusted. "Money cannotpay for such service as hers, not to speak of the risk she ran, forcases have been known of persons being twice attacked by the disease.""You don't think my husband will have a relapse?" asked Mrs. Preston,with fresh alarm."Not if he has the same care for a short time longer.""He shall have it. She must stay. Of course her duties are lighternow, and six dollars a week for the remainder of the time will beenough--don't you think so?""No, I don't," said the doctor, bluntly; "and, moreover, I am quitesure your husband will not consent to reducing the wages of one whosefaithful care has saved his life.""Oh, well, you know best," said Mrs. Preston, slowly. "I am quitewilling that she should be well paid."Mrs. Preston went upstairs, and entered her husband's chamber."Oh, my dear husband!" she exclaimed, theatrically, hurrying acrossthe room, with affected emotion. "I am so glad to find you so muchbetter!""I am glad to see you back, Lucinda," said Colonel Preston; but hespoke coldly, and without the slightest affectation of sentimentaljoy. "I have passed through a good deal since you left me.""And so have I!" exclaimed his wife. "Oh, how my heart has been rentwith anxiety, as I thought of you lying sick, while duty kept me fromyour side.""Is Godfrey well?" asked her husband, taking no notice of her lastspeech."Yes, poor boy! He sends his love, and is so anxious to see you.""Let him come next Friday afternoon," said the sick man, who doubtedthis statement, yet wanted to believe it true."He shall. I will write to him at once."So Mrs. Preston resumed her place in the house; but from that timethere was a something she could not understand in her husband'smanner. He was graver than formerly, and sometimes she saw himwatching her intently, and, after a little, turn away, with a sigh.He had found her out in all her intense selfishness and want offeeling, and he could never again regard her as formerly, even thoughshe tried hard at times, by a show of affection, to cover up herheartless neglect.CHAPTER XXIIIMRS. BURKE HAS GOOD FORTUNEMrs. Burke remained a week longer to nurse Colonel Preston. At the endof this time Mr. Preston thought he was well enough to dispense with anurse, and accordingly she prepared to take leave."I shall always remember your kind service, Mrs. Burke," said thecolonel, warmly."It was only my duty, sir," said the widow, modestly."Not all would have done their duty so faithfully.""I am glad to see you well again," said the widow."Not more than I am to get well, I assure you," said he. "Whenever youare in any trouble, come to me."With these words, he placed in her hands an envelope, which, as sheunderstood, contained the compensation for her services. She thankedhim, and took her departure.Mrs. Preston was curious to know how much her husband paid the nurse,and asked the question."A hundred dollars," he replied."A hundred dollars!" she repeated, in a tone which implieddisapproval. "I thought she agreed to come for ten dollars a week.""So she did.""She has not been here ten weeks; only about six.""That is true, but she has richly earned all I gave her.""Ten dollars a week I consider very handsome remuneration to one inher position in life," said Mrs. Preston, pointedly."Lucinda, but for her attention I probably should not have livedthrough this sickness. Do you think a hundred dollars so much to payfor your husband's life?""You exaggerate the value of her services," said his wife."Dr. Townley says the same thing that I do.""You are both infatuated with that woman," said Mrs. Preston,impatiently."We only do her justice.""Oh, well, have it your own way. But I should have only paid her whatI agreed to. It is a great windfall for her.""She deserves it."Mrs. Preston said no more at this time, for she found her husband too"infatuated," as she termed it, to agree with her. She did, however,open the subject to Godfrey when he came home, and he adopted her viewof the case."She and her low son are trying to get all they can out of father," hesaid. "It's just like them.""I wish I could make your father see it," said Mrs. Preston, "but heseems prepossessed in her favor.""If he can give a hundred dollars to her, he can give me a littleextra money; I'm going to ask him."So he did the same evening."Will you give me ten dollars, father?" he asked."What for?""Oh, for various things. I need it.""I give you an allowance of three dollars a week.""I have a good many expenses.""That will meet all your reasonable expenses. I was far from having asmuch money as that when I was of your age.""I don't see why you won't give me the money," said Godfrey,discontentedly."I don't think you need it.""You are generous enough to others.""To whom do you refer?""You give plenty of money to that Irish boy and his mother.""They have both rendered me great services. The boy saved me frombeing robbed. The mother, in all probability, saved me from falling avictim to smallpox. But that has nothing to do with your affairs. Itis scarcely proper for a boy like you to criticise his father's way ofdisposing of his money.""I confess I think Godfrey is right in commenting upon yourextraordinary liberality to the Burkes," observed Mrs. Preston."Lucinda," said her husband, gravely, "when my own wife deserted mysick bed, leaving me to wrestle alone with a terrible and dangerousdisease, I was fortunate enough to find in Mrs. Burke a devoted nurse.The money I have paid her is no adequate compensation, nor is it allthat I intend to do for her."There was a part of this speech that startled Mrs. Preston. Neverbefore had her husband complained of her desertion of him in hissickness, and she hoped that he had been imposed upon by the excusewhich she gave of saving herself for Godfrey. Now she saw that in thisshe had not been altogether successful, and she regretted havingreferred to Mrs. Burke, and so brought this reproach upon herself. Shefelt it necessary to say something in extenuation."It was because I wanted to live for Godfrey," she said, with aflushed face. "Nothing but that would have taken me away from you atsuch a time. It was a great trial to me," she continued, putting upher handkerchief to eyes that were perfectly dry."We will say no more about it," said Colonel Preston, gravely. "Ishall not refer to it, unless you undervalue my obligations to Mrs.Burke."Mrs. Preston thought it best not to reply, but on one thing that herhusband had said, she commented to Godfrey."Your father speaks of giving more money to Mrs. Burke. I suppose weshall not know anything about it if he does.""Perhaps he will leave her some money in his will," said Godfrey."Very likely. If he does, there is such a thing as contesting awill--that is, if he gives her much."Mrs. Preston was right. Her husband did intend to give his devotednurse something in his will, but of that more anon. There was onething which he did at once, and that was to buy the cottage which Mrs.Burke occupied, from the heir, a non-resident. Mrs. Burke didn't learnthis until she went to pay her rent to the storekeeper, who had actedas agent for the owner."I have nothing to do with the house any longer, Mrs. Burke," he said."Then who shall I pay rent to?" said Mrs. Burke."To Colonel Preston, who has recently bought the house."Mrs. Burke, therefore, called at the house of the colonel.Mr. and Mrs. Preston were sitting together when the servant announcedthat she wished to speak to him."You seem to have a good deal of business with Mrs. Burke," said hiswife, in a very unpleasant tone."None that I care to conceal," he said, smiling. "Show Mrs. Burke inhere, Jane," he continued, addressing the servant."Good-morning, Mrs. Burke," he said, pleasantly."Good-morning," said Mrs. Preston, coldly."Good-morning, sir, I'm glad to see you looking so much better.""Oh, yes, I am feeling pretty well now.""I didn't find out till just now, Colonel Preston, that you were mylandlord."Here Mrs. Preston pricked up her ears, for it was news to her also, asher husband had not mentioned his recent purchase."Yes, I thought I would buy the house, as it was in the market.""I have come to pay my rent. I have been in the habit of payingfifteen dollars a quarter.""I won't be a hard landlord," said Colonel Preston. "You are welcometo live in the house, if it suits you, free of all rent.""This is too much kindness," said Mrs. Burke, quite overwhelmed by theunexpected liberality.Mrs. Preston thought so, too, but could not well say anything."There's been kindness on both sides, Mrs. Burke. Put up your money, Idon't want it, but I have no doubt you will find use for it. Buyyourself a new dress.""Thank you, Colonel Preston. You are very generous, and I am verygrateful," said the widow."I have something to be grateful for also, Mrs. Burke. If you want anyrepairs, just let me know, and they shall be attended to.""Thank you, sir, but the house is very comfortable."She soon took her leave."When did you buy that house, Colonel Preston?" asked his wife."A month since.""You didn't say anything about it to me.""Nor to anyone else, except those with whom I did the business."Mrs. Preston would like to have said more, but she did not think itexpedient, remembering what she had brought upon herself before.CHAPTER XXIVANDY'S JOURNEYToward the first of April of the succeeding year, Miss Sophia Granttook a severe cold, not serious, indeed, but such as to make itprudent for her to remain indoors. This occasioned a littlederangement of her sister's plans; for both sisters were in the habit,about the first of April and of October, of taking a journey toBoston--partly for a change, and partly because at these times certainbanks in which they owned stock declared dividends, which they tookthe opportunity to collect. But this spring it seemed doubtful if theycould go. Yet they wanted the money--a part of it, at least."Send Andrew," suggested Miss Sophia, after her sister had stated thedifficulty.In general Miss Priscilla did not approve Sophia's suggestions, butthis struck her more favorably."I don't know but we might," she said, slowly. "He is a boy to betrusted.""Just so.""And I think he is a smart boy.""Just so.""He can take care of himself. You remember how he saved ColonelPreston from the robber?""Just so.""Then, on the other hand, he has never been to Boston.""He could ask.""I don't suppose there would be any particular difficulty. I couldgive him all the necessary directions.""Just so.""I'll propose it to him."So, after supper, as Andy was going out into the woodshed for anarmful of wood, Miss Priscilla stopped him."Were you ever in Boston, Andy?" asked she."No, ma'am.""I wish you had been.""Why, ma'am?""Because I should like to send you there on some business.""I'll go, ma'am," said Andy, eagerly.Like most boys of his age, no proposition could have been moreagreeable."Do you think you could find your way there, and around the city?""No fear of that, ma'am," said Andy, confidently."We generally go ourselves, as you know, but my sister is sick, and Idon't like to leave her.""Of course not, ma'am," said Andy, quite approving any plan thatopened the way for a journey to him."We own bank stock, and on the first of April they pay us dividends.Now, if we send you, do you think you can get to the bank, get themoney, and bring it back safe?""I'll do it for you, ma'am," said Andy."Well, I'll think of it between now and next week. If we send you atall, you must start next Monday.""I'll go any day, ma'am," said Andy, "any day you name."Miss Priscilla finally decided to send Andrew, but cautioned himagainst saying anything about it, except to his own family.On Monday morning, just before the morning train was to start, Andrewappeared on the platform of the modest village depot with a smallcarpetbag in his hand, lent him by the Misses Grant."Give me a ticket to Boston," said he to the station master.Godfrey Preston, who was about to return to his boarding school, hadjust purchased a ticket, and overheard this. He didn't much care tospeak to Andy, but his curiosity overcame his pride."Are you going to Boston?" he asked."Yes," said Andy."What are you going for?""Important business.""Has Miss Grant turned you off?""She didn't say anything about it this morning. Why, do you want totake my place?""Do you think I'd stoop to be a hired boy?" said Godfrey, haughtily."You wouldn't need to stoop," said Andy; "you ain't any too tall."Godfrey winced at this. He was not tall of his age, and he wanted tobe. Andy had been growing faster than he, and was now, though scarcelyas old, quite two inches taller."It makes no difference about being tall," he rejoined. "I am agentleman, and don't have to work for a living like you do.""What are you going to be when you grow up?""A lawyer.""Then won't you work for money?""Of course.""Then you'll be a hired man, and work for a living.""That's very different. When are you coming back?""When I've finished my business.""How soon will that be?""I can't tell yet.""Humph! I shouldn't wonder if you were running away.""Don't you tell anybody," said Andy, in a bantering tone."Where did you get the money to pay for your ticket?""What would you give to know?""You are impudent," said Godfrey, his cheek flushing."So are your questions," said Andy."I dare say you stole it.""Look here, Godfrey Preston," said Andy, roused to indignation by thisinsinuation, "you'd better not say that again, if you know what's bestfor yourself."He advanced a step with a threatening look, and Godfrey instinctivelyreceded."That comes of my speaking to my inferior," he said."You can't do that.""What do you mean?""I don't know anybody that's inferior to you."Godfrey turned on his heel wrathfully, muttering something about a"low beggar," which Andy, not hearing, did not resent.The whistle of the locomotive was heard, and the cars came along.With high anticipation of pleasure, Andy got aboard. He had before hima journey of close upon a hundred miles, and he wished it had beenlonger. He had never been much of a traveler, and the scenes whichwere to greet his eyes were all novel. He had heard a good deal ofBoston also, and he wanted to see it.Besides the money which Miss Grant had given him to defray hisexpenses, he had with him ten dollars of his own. Since his mother hadreceived the two donations from Colonel Preston she made Andy keephalf his wages for his own use. These were now seven dollars a week,so he kept three and a half, and of this sum was able to lay up abouthalf. So he had a supply of money in his trunk, of which he had takenwith him ten dollars."Maybe I'll see something I want to buy in the city," he said tohimself.I don't mean to dwell upon the journey. There is nothing very excitingin a railway trip, even of a hundred miles, nowadays, unless, indeed,the cars run off the track, or over the embankment, and then it isaltogether too exciting to be agreeable. For the sake of my younghero, whom I really begin to like, though he was "only an Irish boy,"I am glad to say that nothing of that sort took place; but in goodtime--about the time when the clock on the Old South steeple indicatednoon--Andy's train drove into the Boston & Maine Railway depot,fronting on Haymarket Square."Inquire your way to Washington Street."That was the first direction that Andy had received from MissPriscilla, and that was what our hero did first.The question was addressed to a very civil young man, who politelygave Andy the necessary directions. So, in a short time, he reachedWashington Street by way of Court Street.The next thing was to inquire the way to the Merchants' Bank, thatbeing the one in which the ladies owned the largest amount of stock."Where is the Merchants' Bank?" asked Andy of a boy, whoseblacking-box denoted his occupation."I'll show you, mister," said the boy. "Come along." His young guide,instead of taking him to the bank, took him to the side door of thecourt-house, and said:"Go in there."It was a massive stone building, and Andy, not suspecting that he wasbeing fooled, went in. Wandering at random, he found his way into aroom, where a trial was going on. That opened his eyes."He cheated me," thought Andy. "Maybe I'll get even with him."He retraced his steps, and again found himself in the street. Hisfraudulent young guide, with a grin on a face not over clean, wasawaiting his appearance.CHAPTER XXVTHE MERCHANT FROM PORTLAND"Look here, young chap," said Andy, "what made you tell me that wasthe Merchants' Bank?""Isn't it?" asked the bootblack, with a grin."It's the bank where you'll be wanted some time. Shouldn't wonder ifthey'd make a mistake and lock you up instead of your money.""Have you got any money in the Merchants' Bank?" asked the other."I'm goin' to see if they won't give me some. If you hadn't cheatedme, maybe I'd have invited you to dine with me at my hotel.""Where are you stoppin'?" asked the street boy, not quite knowing howmuch of Andy's story to believe."At the most fashionable hotel.""Parker's?""You're good at guessin'. Perhaps you'd like to dine there?""I don't know as they'd let me in," said the boy, doubtfully; "butI'll show you where there's a nice eatin' house, where they don'tcharge half so much.""'Twouldn't be fashionable enough for me. I shall have to dine alone.See what comes of tryin' to fool your grandfather."Andy went on, leaving the boy in doubt whether his jest had reallylost him a dinner.Andy didn't go to the Parker House, however. His expenses were to bepaid by the Misses Grant, and he felt that it wouldn't be right to beextravagant at their expense."I shall come across an eatin' house presently," he said to himself.Not far off he found one with the bill of fare exposed outside, withthe prices. Andy examined it, and found that it was not an expensiveplace. He really felt hungry after his morning's ride, and determined,before he attended to his business, to get dinner. He accordinglyentered, and seated himself at one of the tables. A waiter came up andawaited his commands."What'll you have?" he asked."Bring me a plate of roast beef, and a cup of coffee," said Andy, "andbe quick about it, for I haven't eaten anything for three weeks.""Then I don't think one plate will be enough for you," said thewaiter, laughing."It'll do to begin on," said Andy.The order was quickly filled, and Andy set to work energetically.It is strange how we run across acquaintances when we least expect it.Andy had no idea that he knew anybody in the eating house, andtherefore didn't look around, feeling no special interest in thecompany. Yet there was one present who recognized him as soon as heentered, and watched him with strong interest. The interest was notfriendly, however, as might be inferred from the scowl with which hesurveyed him. This will not be a matter of surprise to the reader whenI say that the observer was no other than Fairfax, whose attempt torob Colonel Preston had been defeated by Andy.He recognized the boy at once, both from his appearance and his voice,and deep feelings of resentment ran in his breast. To be foiled wasdisagreeable enough, but to be foiled by a boy was most humiliating,and he had vowed revenge, if ever an opportunity occurred. For thisreason he felt exultant when he saw his enemy walking into the eatinghouse."I'll follow him," he said to himself, "and it'll go hard if I don'tget even with him for that trick he played on me."But how did it happen that Andy did not recognize Fairfax?For two reasons: First, because the adventurer was sitting behind him,and our hero faced the front of the room. Next, had he seen him, itwas doubtful if he would have recognized a man whom he was far fromexpecting to see. For Fairfax was skilled in disguises, and no longerwas the black-whiskered individual that we formerly knew him. Frommotives of prudence, he had shaved off his black hair and whiskers,and now appeared in a red wig, and whiskers of the same hue. If any ofmy readers would like to know how effectual this disguise is, let themtry it, and I will guarantee that they won't know themselves when theycome to look at their likeness in the mirror.After disposing of what he had ordered, Andy also ordered a plate ofapple dumpling, which he ate with great satisfaction."I wouldn't mind eatin' here every day," he thought. "Maybe I'll be inbusiness here some day myself, and then I'll come here and dine."Fairfax was through with his dinner, but waited till Andy arose. Hethen arose and followed him to the desk, where both paid at the sametime. He was careless of recognition, for he felt confident in hisdisguise."Now," thought Andy, "I must go to the bank."But he didn't know where the bank was. So, when he got into thestreet, he asked a gentleman whom he met: "Sir, can you direct me tothe Merchants' Bank?""It is in State Street," said the gentleman. "I am going past it, soif you will come along with me, I will show you.""Thank you, sir," said our hero, politely."Merchants' Bank!" said Fairfax to himself, beginning to feelinterested. "I wonder what he's going there for? Perhaps I can raise alittle money, besides having my revenge."He had an added inducement now in following our hero.When Andy went into the bank, Fairfax followed him. He was in the roomwhen Andy received the dividends, and, with sparkling eyes, he sawthat it was, a thick roll of bills, representing, no doubt, aconsiderable sum of money."That money must be mine," he said to himself. "It can't be the boy's.He must have been sent by some other person. The loss will get himinto trouble. Very likely he will be considered a thief. That wouldjust suit me."Andy was careful, however. He put the money into a pocketbook, or,rather, wallet, with which he had been supplied by the Misses Grant,put it in his inside pocket, and then buttoned his coat up tight. Hewas determined not to lose anything by carelessness.But this was not his last business visit. There was another bank inthe same street where it was necessary for him to call and receivedividends. Again Fairfax followed him, and again he saw Andy receive aconsiderable sum of money."There's fat pickings here," thought Fairfax. "Now, I must manage, insome way, to relieve him of that money. There's altogether too muchfor a youngster like him. Shouldn't wonder if the money belonged tothat man I tried to rob. If so, all the better."In this conjecture, as we know, Fairfax was mistaken. However, it madecomparatively little difference to him whose money it was, as long asthere was a chance of his getting it into his possession. The factwas, that his finances were not in a very flourishing condition justat present. He could have done better to follow some honest andrespectable business, and avoid all the dishonest shifts andinfractions of law to which he was compelled to resort, but he hadstarted wrong, and it was difficult to persuade him that even now itwould have been much better for him to amend his life and ways. Inthis state of affairs he thought it a great piece of good luck that heshould have fallen in with a boy in charge of a large sum of money,whom, from his youth and inexperience, he would have less trouble inrobbing than an older person.Andy had already decided how he would spend the afternoon. He hadheard a good deal about the Boston Museum, its large collection ofcuriosities, and the plays that were performed there. One of thepleasantest anticipations he had was of a visit to this place, theparadise of country people. Now that his business was concluded, hedetermined to go there at once. But first he must inquire the way.Turning around, he saw Fairfax without recognizing him."Can you direct me to the Boston Museum?" he asked."Certainly, with pleasure," said Fairfax, with alacrity. "In fact, Iam going there myself. I suppose you are going to the afternoonperformance?""Yes, sir.""Have you ever been there?""No; but I have heard a good deal about it. I don't live in the city.""Nor do I," said Fairfax. "I am a merchant of Portland, Maine. I havecome to the city to buy my winter stock of goods. As I only come twicea year, I generally try to enjoy myself a little while I am here. Doyou stay in the city overnight?""Yes," said Andy."So do I. Here is the Museum."They had reached the Museum, which, as some of my readers are aware,is situated in Tremont Street."We go up these stairs," said Fairfax. "If you don't object, we willtake seats together.""I shall be glad to have company," said Andy, politely.Reserved seats adjoining were furnished, and the adventurer and hisintended victim entered the Museum.CHAPTER XXVISPINNING THE WEBThere was a short interval before the play commenced. This Andyimproved by examining the large stock of curiosities which have beengathered from all parts of the world for the gratification ofvisitors. Fairfax kept at his side, and spoke freely of all they saw.There was something about him which seemed to Andy strangely familiar.Was it in his features, or in his voice? He could not tell. The redwhig and whiskers misled him. Andy finally set it down as a merechance resemblance to someone whom he had met formerly, and dismissedit from his mind.At length the increasing crowds pouring into the lecture-room remindedthem that the play was about to begin."Shall we go in and take our seats?" said Fairfax.Andy assented, and they were speedily in their seats.I do not propose to speak of the play. It was a novelty to Andy to seea dramatic representation, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Fairfax wasmore accustomed to such things, but pretended to be equallyinterested, feeling that in this way he could ingratiate himselfbetter into Andy's confidence.At last it was over, and they went out of the building."How did you like it?" asked Fairfax."Tiptop," said Andy, promptly. "Don't you think so?""Capital," answered Fairfax, with simulated delight. "I am glad I hadcompany. I don't enjoy anything half as well alone. By the way, wheredo you pass the night?""At some hotel--I don't know which.""Suppose you go to the Adams House. I've got to stop overnightsomewhere, and it might be pleasanter going in company.""Where is the Adams House?""On Washington Street, not very far off--ten or fifteen minutes'walk.""If it's a good place, I'm willing.""It is an excellent hotel, and moderate in price. We might go up therenow, and engage a room, and then spend the evening where we like.""Very well," said Andy.They soon reached the Adams House--a neat, unpretending hotel--andentered. They walked up to the desk, and Fairfax spoke to the clerk."Can you give us a room?""Certainly. Enter your names.""Shall we room together?" asked Fairfax, calmly.Now Andy, though he had had no objection to going to the theater withhis present companion, did not care to take a room with a stranger, ofwhom he knew nothing. He might be a very respectable man, but somehow,Andy did not know why, there was something in his manner whichinspired a little repulsion. Besides, he remembered that he hadconsiderable money with him, and that consideration alone rendered itimprudent for him to put himself in the power of a companion. So hesaid, a little awkwardly:"I think we'd better take separate rooms.""Very well," said Fairfax, in a tone of indifference, though he reallyfelt very much disappointed. "I thought it might have been a littlemore sociable to be together."Andy did not take the hint, except so far as to say:"We can take rooms alongside of each other.""I can give you adjoining rooms, if you desire," said the clerk.Fairfax here entered his name in the hotel register as "NathanielMarvin, Portland, Maine," while Andy put down his real address. Hiscompanion's was, of course, fictitious. He did not venture to give thename of Fairfax, as that might be recognized by Andy as that of thehighwayman, with whose little plans he had interfered.A servant was called, and they went up to their rooms, which, as theclerk had promised, were found to be adjoining. They were preciselyalike."Very comfortable, Mr. Burke," said Fairfax, in a tone of apparentsatisfaction. "I think we shall have a comfortable night.""I guess so," said Andy."Are you going to stay here now?""No; I'm going to wash my face, and then take a walk around. I want tosee something of the city.""I think I'll lie down awhile; I feel tired. Perhaps we shall meetlater. If not, I shall see you in the morning.""All right," said Andy.In a few minutes he went out.CHAPTER XXVIITHE DROP GAMEFairfax had an object in remaining behind. He wanted to see if therewas any way for him to get into Andy's room during the night, that hemight rob him in his sleep. To his great satisfaction, he found thatthere was a door between the two rooms, for the accommodation ofpersons in the same party, who wished to be in adjoining apartments.It was, however, locked, but Fairfax was not unprepared for such anemergency. He took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and tried them,one after another, in the lock. There was one that would very nearlyfit. For this again, Fairfax was prepared. He took from the samepocket a file, and began patiently to file away the key till it shouldfit. He tried it several times before he found that it fitted. But atlast success crowned his efforts. The door opened.His eyes danced with exultation, as he saw this."I might as well be in the same room," he said, to himself. "Now, youyoung rascal, I shall take your money, and be revenged upon you at thesame time."He carefully locked the door, and then, feeling that he had done allthat was necessary to do at present, went downstairs, and took supper.Andy was out, and did not see him.Meanwhile, our young hero was out seeing the sights. He walked upWashington Street, and at Boylston Street turned and reached TremontStreet, when he saw the Common before him. It looked pleasant, andAndy crossed the street, and entered. He walked wherever fancy led,and then found himself, after a while, in a comparatively secludedpart. Here he met with an adventure, which I must describe.Rather a shabby-looking individual in front of him suddenly stoopedand picked up a pocketbook, which appeared to be well filled withmoney. He looked up, and met Andy's eyes fixed upon it. This was whathe wanted."Here's a pocketbook," he said. "Somebody must have dropped it."Andy was interested."It seems to have considerable money in it," said the finder."Open it, and see," said Andy."I hain't time. I have got to leave the city by the next train. Imean, I haven't time to advertise it, and get the reward which theowner will be sure to offer. Are you going to stay in the city long?""I'm going out to-morrow.""I must go. I wish I knew what to do."He seemed to be plunged into anxious thought."I'll tell you what I'll do," he said, as if a bright idea hadsuddenly struck him. "You take the pocketbook, and advertise it. Ifthe owner is found, he will give you a reward. If not, the whole willbelong to you.""All right," said Andy. "Hand it over.""Of course," said the other, "I shall expect something myself, as Iwas the one to find it.""I'll give you half.""But I shall be out of the city. I'll tell you what give me tendollars, and I'll make it over to you.""That's rather steep," said Andy."Heft it. There must be a lot of money inside.""I'm afraid the reward might be less than ten dollars," said Andy."Well, I'm in a great hurry--give me five."It is possible that Andy, who was not acquainted with the "drop game,"might have agreed to this, but a policeman hove in sight, and theshabby individual scuttled away without further ceremony, leaving Andya little surprised, with the pocketbook in his hand."What's he in such a hurry for?" thought our hero.He opened the pocketbook, and a light flashed upon him, as heperceived that there was no money inside, but was stuffed with rollsof paper."He wanted to swindle me," thought Andy. "It's lucky I didn't pay himfive dollars. Anyway, I'll keep it. The pocketbook is worthsomething."He put it in his pocket, without taking the trouble to remove thecontents.CHAPTER XXVIIITHE GUEST OF TWO HOTELSAndy wandered about till nine o'clock, determined to see as much ofthe city as possible in the limited time which he had at his disposal;but at last he became tired, and returned to the hotel. Fairfax wasseated in the reading-room. He looked up as Andy entered."Have you been looking around the city?" he asked."Yes," said Andy; "I wanted to improve my time.""I suppose, as this is your first visit, you see a good deal that isnew?""It's all new," said Andy. "I feel tired, walking around so much.""No doubt. Are you going to bed now?""I guess I'll turn in.""I shan't go up quite yet. I have been staying here quietly, and Idon't feel tired. I shall go up in the course of an hour or two.""Good-night, then," said Andy."Good-night. I hope you'll sleep sound," said Fairfax, who wascertainly entirely sincere in this wish, as the success of his plansdepended on the soundness of our hero's repose.Andy went upstairs, and lighted the gas in his bedroom. He noticed thedoor communicating with the next one, and tried it, but found it to belocked."That's all right," said Andy. "Nobody can get in that way."He locked the principal door, and bolted it, also, which seemed tomake him perfectly secure."Now," thought he, after undressing, "where shall I put the money?"This was an important question, as he had between five hundred and athousand dollars belonging to the Misses Grant, of which it was hisduty to take even more care than if it belonged to himself."I guess I'll put it under the bolster," he reflected, "covering it upwith the sheet. Nobody can get in, that I can see, but it is best tobe careful."In emptying his pockets, he came across the pocketbook, with its shamcontents, of which mention has already been made."I'll leave that in my pocket," he said to himself, with a smile. "I'mnot afraid of losing that. By the powers, it wouldn't be much of aprize to the man that took it; I'm sure of that."He laid his clothes on a chair, in the middle of the room, and jumpedinto bed, when he soon sank into a deep sleep.Meanwhile, Fairfax remained below in the reading-room. He was not atall sleepy, as he had told Andy, and his mind was full of the schemeof robbery, which appeared so promising. He was glad Andy had retiredso early, as he would be asleep sooner, and this would make thingsfavorable for his entering his young companion's chamber. It was hisintention, after he had secured the "plunder"--to adopt a Westernphrase--to come downstairs and leave the hotel, not to return, asotherwise, as soon as Andy should discover his loss, the door betweenthe two rooms would, naturally, point to him as the thief.He didn't go up to his room till half-past ten. This was an hour and ahalf later than Andy retired, and would give him a chance to get fastasleep."He must be asleep now," he thought.On reaching the corridor on which both of the chambers were situated,he stood a moment before Andy's door, and listened. It was not oftenthat our young hero was guilty of snoring, but to-night he was weary,and had begun to indulge in this nocturnal disturbance. The soundswhich he heard were very satisfactory to Fairfax."The boy's fast asleep," he muttered. "I'll go into his room, and makequick work of it. Fairfax, you're in luck, for once. Fortune has takena turn."Softly he opened the door of his own room, and entered. He lit thegas, and then, going to the door of communication between the tworooms, he listened again. There was no cessation of the sounds whichhe had heard from the outside. He determined to make the attempt atonce. Taking the proper key from his pocket, he fitted it into thelock, and, turning it, the door opened, and he stepped into theadjoining apartment. It was dark, for Andy had extinguished the gas ongoing to bed, but the gas from his own room made it sufficiently lightfor his purpose. He at once caught sight of Andy's clothes lying onthe chair, where he had placed them. He glanced cautiously at ourhero, as he lay extended upon the bed, with one arm flung out, but hesaw no reason for alarm. Quickly he glided to the chair with noiselessstep (he had removed his boots, by way of precaution), and thrust hishand into the pocket of the coat. It came in contact with the falsepocketbook, which seemed bulky and full of money. Fairfax neverdoubted that it was the right one, and quickly thrust it into his ownpocket. Just then Andy moved a little in bed, and Fairfax retreated,hastily, through the door, closing it after him."Now, the sooner I get out of this hotel, the better!" he thought."The boy may wake and discover his loss. It isn't likely, but it mayhappen. At any rate it's very much better to be on the safe side."He did not stop to examine the prize which he had secured. He had nodoubt whatever that it contained the money he was after. To stop tocount it might involve him in peril. He, therefore, put on his boots,and glided out of the chamber and downstairs.To the clerk who was at the desk he said, as he surrendered his key:"How late do you keep open? Till after midnight?""Certainly," was the reply."All right. I may be out till late."He left the key, and went out into the street. He hailed a passing carin Tremont Street, and rode for some distance. In Court Street he goton board a Charlestown car, and in half an hour found himself in thecity everywhere known by the granite shaft that commemorates thebattle of Bunker Hill. He made his way to a hotel, where he took aroom, entering here under the name of James Simmons, Portsmouth, NewHampshire. Anxious to examine his prize, he desired to be shown atonce to a chamber. He followed the servant who conducted him withimpatient steps. The stolen money was burning in his pocket. He wantedto know how much he had, and was more than half resolved to take anearly train the next morning for the West, where he thought he shouldbe secure from discovery."Is there anything wanted, sir?" asked the servant, lingering at thedoor."No, no," said Fairfax, impatiently. "It's all right.""Might be a little more polite," muttered the snubbed servant, as hewent downstairs."Now for it!" exclaimed Fairfax, exultingly. "Now, let me see how muchI have got."He drew the pocketbook from his pocket, and opened it. His heart gavea quick thump, and he turned ashy pale, as his glance rested upon theworthless roll of brown paper with which it had been stuffed."Curse the boy!" he cried, in fierce and bitter disappointment. "Hehas fooled me, after all! Why didn't I stop long enough to open thepocketbook before I came away? Blind, stupid fool that I was! I am asbadly off as before--nay, worse, for I have exposed myself tosuspicion, and haven't got a penny to show for it."I will not dwell upon his bitter self-reproaches, and, above all, theintense mortification he felt at having been so completely fooled by aboy, whom he had despised as verdant and inexperienced in the ways ofthe, world--to think that success had been in his grasp, and he hadmissed it, after all, was certainly disagreeable enough. It occurredto him that he might go back to the Adams House even now, and repairhis blunder. It was not likely that Andy was awake yet. He was veryweary, and boys of his age were likely, unless disturbed, to sleepthrough the night. He might retrieve his error, and no one would bethe wiser."I'll do it," he said, at length.He went downstairs, and left the hotel without the knowledge of theclerk. Jumping into the horse-cars, he returned to Boston, and enteredthe Adams House about half-past twelve o'clock. He claimed his key atthe desk, and went upstairs to his room. He had scarcely lit the gas,however, when a knock was heard at the door. Opening itunsuspiciously, he turned pale, as he recognized the clerk, in companywith an officer of the law."What's wanted?" he faltered."You are wanted," was the brief reply."What for?" he gasped."You are charged with entering the adjoining room, and stealing apocketbook from the boy who sleeps there.""It's a lie!" he said, but his tone was nervous."You must submit to a search," said the officer."Do you mean to insult me?" demanded Fairfax, assuming an air ofoutraged virtue."Not at all. I am only giving you a chance to clear yourself fromsuspicion.""I am a respectable merchant from Portland. I was never so insulted inmy life," said Fairfax."If the charge proves groundless, I will make you an ample apology,"said the officer.Fairfax was compelled to submit to the search. He cursed his stupidityin not throwing away the worthless pocketbook, but this he hadneglected to do, and, of course, it was very significant evidenceagainst him. Not only was this found, but the variety of keys alreadyreferred to."You carry a great many keys," said the officer."It isn't a crime to carry keys, is it?" demanded Fairfax, sullenly."Not if no improper use is made of them. I suspect that one of themwill open the door into the next chamber."The keys were tried, and one did open the door. As the light flashedinto the room, Andy got up."Come here, young man," said the officer. "Can you identify thatpocketbook?""I can," said Andy."Is it yours?""When I went to bed, it was in the pocket of my coat, lying on thatchair.""It is certainly a wonderful pocketbook. I have just found it in thatgentleman's pocket."Fairfax's eyes were bent malignantly upon Andy. A light flashed uponhim. Now, he recognized him."I know you," he said. "You are the man that stopped Colonel Preston,and tried to rob him.""You lie, curse you!" exclaimed Fairfax, springing forward, and tryingto throw himself upon Andy. But he was not quick enough. The officerhad interposed, and seized him by the collar."Not so fast, Mr. Marvin, or whatever your name is. We don't allow anysuch games as that. Sit down till I want you."The baffled adventurer was jerked into a chair, from which hecontinued to eye Andy savagely."What's that affair you were talking about, young man?" asked theofficer.Andy briefly related his adventure with Fairfax on a former occasion."I'll trouble you to come with me, Mr. Marvin, or Fairfax," said theofficer. "There's another hotel where lodgings are provided for suchas you."Resistance was useless, and the detected thief, though his name wasregistered at two hotels, was compelled to occupy a less agreeableroom at the station-house. How he was detected will be explained inthe next chapter.CHAPTER XXIXA STARTLING EVENTSometimes, the mere presence of a person in the room is sufficient tointerrupt even sound repose. At all events, whether it was theentrance of Fairfax, acting in some mysterious way upon Andy, or thelight that streamed into the room, his slumber was disturbed, and hiseyes opened just as the adventurer was retiring, with his supposedbooty.Our hero did not immediately take in the situation. He was naturally alittle bewildered, being just aroused from sleep, but in a short timethe real state of the case dawned upon him."By the powers!" he said to himself, "it's that man that went to themuseum with me! He saw my money, and he came in for it! I'll get upand see."Quietly and noiselessly he got out of bed, and, going to the chair,felt in his pockets, and so discovered the loss of the stuffedpocketbook.Andy wanted to laugh, but forbore, lest the sound should be heard inthe next room."It's a good joke on the dirty thafe!" said Andy, to himself. "He'swelcome to all the money, he's got--it won't carry him far, I'mthinkin'."Prudence suggested another thought. When Fairfax found out theworthlessness of his booty, would he not come back and search for thereal treasure?"If he does, I'll fight him," thought Andy.Still, he knew the conflict would be unequal, since the other wasconsiderably his superior in strength. However, Andy determined that,come what might, he would defend his trust, "or perish in theattempt." But, while he was coming to this determination, he heard thedoor of the adjoining chamber open softly, and then he could hearsteps along the corridor. Evidently, the thief had not found out theactual character of his booty, but was going off under the impressionthat it was valuable."Maybe he'll come back," thought Andy. "I guess I'd better go down andgive notice at the desk. Then, if he comes back, he'll get into hotwater."He hastily dressed himself, and, locking his door, went downstairs.First, however, he removed the money from under his pillow, and put itinto his pocket. He found the clerk at the desk."Has the man that came in with me gone out?" asked Andy."Mr. Marvin?""Yes.""He went out about five minutes ago.""Did he say anything about coming back?""He said it would be late when he returned. He asked me if we keptopen after twelve. Did you want to find him?""I should like to have the police find him," said Andy."How is that?" asked the clerk, surprised."He has robbed me.""Did you leave your door unlocked?""No; but there was a door between our rooms. He opened it, and stole apocketbook from the pocket of my coat.""While you were asleep?""Yes; but I awoke just in time to see him go through the door.""How much money was there in it?""That's the joke of it," said Andy, laughing; "there was no money atall, only some folds of paper. He got hold of the wrong pocketbook."Thereupon, he told the story of the "drop game," of which he came nearbeing a victim, and what a useful turn the bogus treasure had donehim."There's the right pocketbook," he said, in conclusion. "I wish youwould take care of it for me till to-morrow. The money isn't mine, andI don't want to run any more risk with it.""I'll lock it up in the safe for you," said the clerk. "Is theremuch?""Several hundred dollars.""You were very fortunate in escaping as you did," said the clerk."True for you," said Andy. "He may come back when he finds out how hehas been fooled.""If he does, I'll call a policeman. We'll make short work with him."The reader has already heard how Fairfax (or Marvin) did return, andhow he met with a reception he had not calculated upon. Andy wasinformed in the morning that it would be necessary for him to appearas a witness against him in order to secure his conviction. This hedid the next day, but the judge delayed sentence, on being informedthat the accused was charged with a more serious offense, that ofstopping a traveler on the highway. His trial on this count must comebefore a higher court, and he was remanded to prison till his case wascalled in the calendar. Andy was informed that he would be summoned asa witness in that case also, as well as Colonel Preston, and answeredthat he would be ready when called upon.We will so far anticipate events as to say that the testimony of Andyand the colonel was considered conclusive by the court, and, on thestrength of it, Mr. Fairfax, alias Marvin, was sentenced to severalyears' imprisonment at hard labor.Andy met with no further adventures in his present visit, but had thesatisfaction of delivering the money he had been sent to collect toMiss Priscilla Grant.Now, advancing our story some three months, we come to an afternoonwhen Miss Sophia Grant, returning from a walk, with visible marks ofexcitement, rushed, breathless and panting, into her sister'spresence."What's the matter, Sophia?" asked Priscilla."Such an awful thing!" she gasped."What is it?""You won't believe it.""Tell me at once what it is!""It seems so sudden!""Good heavens! Sophia, why do you tantalize me so?""Just so!" gasped Sophia."If you don't tell me, I'll shake you!""Colonel Preston's dead--dropped dead in the store ten minutes ago. Iwas there, and saw him."This startling intelligence was only too true. Suddenly, without aninstant's warning, the colonel had been summoned from life--succumbingto a fit of apoplexy. This event, of course, made a great sensation inthe village, but it is of most interest to us as it affects thefortunes of our young hero.CHAPTER XXXCOLONEL PRESTON'S WILLMrs. Preston was a cold woman, and was far from being a devoted wife.She was too selfish for that supreme love which some women bestow upontheir husbands. Still, when Colonel Preston's lifeless form wasbrought into the house, she did experience a violent shock. To havethe companion of nearly twenty years so unexpectedly taken away mightwell touch the most callous, and so, for a few minutes, Mrs. Prestonforgot herself and thought of her husband.But this was not for long. The thought of her own selfish interestscame back, and in the midst of her apparent grief the question forceditself upon her consideration, "Did my husband make a will?"Of course, she did not give utterance to this query. She knew what wasexpected of her, and she was prudent enough to keep up appearancesbefore the neighbors, who poured into the house to offer theirsympathy. She received them with her cambric handkerchief pressed toher eyes, from which, by dint of effort, she succeeded in squeezing afew formal tears, and, while her bosom appeared to heave with emotion,she was mentally calculating how much Colonel Preston had probablyleft."Shan't I stay with you, my dear Mrs. Preston?" said worthy Mrs.Cameron, in a tone full of warm interest and sympathy."Thank you," said Mrs. Preston, in a low voice; "you are very kind,but I would rather be left alone.""But it must be so sad for you to be alone in your sorrow," said herneighbor."No. I can bear sorrow better alone," said the newly made widow."Perhaps I am peculiar, but I would prefer it.""If you really wish it," said the other, reluctantly."Yes, I wish it. Thank you for your kind offer, but I know my ownfeelings, and the presence of others would only increase my pain."This was what she said to others who made the same offer. It did notexcite great surprise, for Mrs. Preston had never leaned upon anyonefor sympathy, nor was she ready with her sympathy when others were introuble. She was self-poised and self-contained, and, in fact, forthis reason was not popular with her neighbors. Still, in this herdistress they were ready to forget all this and extend the samecordial sympathy which they would have done in other cases. There wasbut one person whose company she did crave at this time and this washer son, Godfrey. So, when Alfred Turner offered to go for him thenext morning, she accepted his offer with thanks.At last she was left alone. The servant had gone to bed, and there wasno one but herself and her dead husband in the lower part of thehouse. She no longer sat with her handkerchief pressed before hereyes. Her face wore its usual look of calm composure. She was busilythinking, not of her husband's fate, but of her own future."Did he leave a will? And, if so, how much did he leave me?" shethought.If there was a will, it was probably in the house, and Mrs. Prestondetermined to find it, if possible."Of course, all ought to come to me and Godfrey," she soliloquized. "Idon't think it is right to leave money to charitable institutions aslong as a wife and child are living. Fortunately, my husband had nobrothers or sisters, or perhaps he would have divided the property. Ifthere is no will, I shall have my thirds, and shall have the controlof Godfrey's property till he comes of age. I think I will go toBoston to live. My friend, Mrs. Boynton, has a very pleasant house onWorcester Street. I should like to settle down somewhere near her. Idon't know how much Mr. Preston was worth, but I am sure we shall haveenough for that. I always wanted to live in the city. This village isintolerably stupid, and so are the people. I shall be glad to getaway."Could the good women, whose kind hearts had prompted them to proffertheir sympathy, have heard these words they would not have been likelyto obtrude any more on the hard, cold woman who held them in such lowestimation.Mrs. Preston took the lamp in her hand, and began to explore herhusband's desk. She had often thought of doing so, but, as his deathwas not supposed to be so near, she had not thought that there was anyimmediate cause of doing so. Besides, it had almost been her beliefthat he had made no will. Now she began to open drawers and untieparcels of papers, but it was some time before she came to what shesought. At length, however, her diligence was rewarded. In the middleof a pile of papers, she found one labeled on the outside:                            MY WILL.Her heart beat as she opened it, and, though there was no need, for itwas now past ten o'clock, and there was not likely to be a caller atthat late hour, she looked cautiously about her, and even peered outof the window into the darkness, but could find no one whoseobservation she might fear.I am not about to recite at length the items in the will, whichcovered a page of foolscap. It is enough to quote two items, whichMrs. Preston read with anger and dissatisfaction. They are as follows:    "Item.--To my young friend, Andy Burke, son of the widow    Burke, of this village, in consideration of a valuable    service rendered to me on one occasion, and as a mark of my    regard and interest, I give and bequeath the sum of five    thousand dollars; and to his mother, as a token of gratitude    for her faithful nursing when I was dangerously sick with the    smallpox, I give and bequeath, free of all incumbrance, the    cottage in which she at present resides.    "Item.--To the town I give five thousand dollars, the    interest to be annually appropriated to the purchase of books    for a public library, for the benefit of all the citizens,    provided the town will provide some suitable place in which    to keep them."All the balance of the property was left to his wife and son, in equalproportions, his wife to be the guardian of Godfrey till he shouldhave attained his majority. As Colonel Preston was well known to berich, this seemed to be an adequate provision, but Mrs. Preston didnot look upon it in that light. On the contrary, she was deeplyincensed at the two legacies of which mention has been made above."Was ever anything more absurd than to waste five thousand dollars anda house upon that Irish boy and his mother?" she said to herself. "Idon't suppose it was so much my husband's fault. That artful woman gotaround him, and wheedled him into it. I know now why she was sowilling to come here and take care of him when he was sick. She wantedto wheedle him into leaving money to her low-lived boy. She is anartful and designing hussy, and I should like to tell her so to herface."The cold and usually impassible woman was deeply excited. Her selfishnature made her grudge any of her husband's estate to others, except,indeed, to Godfrey, who was the only person she cared for. As shethought over the unjust disposition, as she regarded it, which herhusband had made of his property, a red spot glowed in her usuallypale cheek.Then it was another grievance that money should have been left to thetown."What claim had the town on my husband," she thought, "that he shouldgive it five thousand dollars? In doing it, he was robbing Godfrey andme. It was wrong. He had no right to do it. What do I care for thesepeople? They are a set of common farmers and mechanics, with whom Icondescend to associate because I have no one else here, except theminister's and the doctor's family, to speak to. Soon I shall be inthe city, and then I don't care if I never set eyes on any of themagain. In Boston I can find suitable society."The more Mrs. Preston thought of it, the more she felt aggravated bythe thought that so large a share of her husband's property was to goto others. She fixed her eyes thoughtfully on the document which sheheld in her hand, and a strong temptation came to her."If this should disappear," she said to herself, "the money would beall mine and Godfrey's, and no one would be the wiser. That Irish boyand his mother would stay where they belonged, and my Godfrey wouldhave his own. Why should I not burn it? It would only be just."Deluding herself by this false view, she persuaded herself that it wasright to suppress the will. With steady hand she held it to the flameof the lamp, and watched it as it was slowly consumed. Then, gatheringup the fragments, she threw them away."It is all ours now," she whispered, triumphantly, as she prepared togo to bed. "It was lucky I found the will."CHAPTER XXXIMRS. PRESTON'S INTENTIONSGodfrey returned home on the day after his father's death. He hadnever witnessed death before, and it frightened him, for the time,into propriety. He exhibited none of the stormy and impetuous griefwhich a warm-hearted and affectionate boy would have been likely toexhibit. It was not in his nature.When he and his mother were left alone, he showed his resemblance toher, by asking:"Do you know how much property father left?""I don't know. He never told me about his affairs as he ought. I thinkhe must have left near a hundred thousand dollars."Godfrey's eyes sparkled."That's a pile of money," he said. "It goes to me, don't it?""To us," said Mrs. Preston."A woman doesn't need so much money as a man," said Godfrey,selfishly."You are not a man yet," said his mother, dryly. "Your father may haveleft a will. In that case, he may have left a part of his property toothers.""Do you think he has?" inquired Godfrey, in alarm."I don't think any will will be found," said his mother, quietly. "Henever spoke to me of making one.""Of course not. That wouldn't be fair, would it?""It is fitting that the property should all go to us.""When shall I get mine?""When you are twenty-one.""That's a long time to wait," said Godfrey, grumblingly."You are only a boy yet. I shall probably be your guardian.""I hope you'll give me a larger allowance than father did.""I will.""Must I go back to boarding school? I don't want to.""If I go to Boston to live, as I think I shall, I will take you withme, and you can go to school there.""That'll be jolly," said Godfrey, his eyes sparkling withanticipation. "I've got tired of this miserable town.""So have I," said his mother. "We shall have more privileges inBoston.""I can go to the theater as often as I please there, can't I?""We will see about that.""How soon shall we move to the city?""As soon as business will allow. I must settle up your father'saffairs here.""Can't I go beforehand?""Would you leave me alone?" asked his mother, with a little touch ofwounded affection, for she did feel attached to her son. He was theonly one, indeed, for whom she felt any affection."You won't miss me, mother. It'll be awfully stupid here, and you knowyou'll be coming to the city as soon as you get through with thebusiness."Mrs. Preston was disappointed, but she should not have been surprised.Her only son reflected her own selfishness."It would not look well for you to go to the theater just at thepresent," she said."Why not?""So soon after your father's death."Godfrey said nothing, but looked discontented. It was early to thinkof amusement, while his father lay yet unburied in the next room. Heleft the room, whistling. He could not gainsay his mother'sobjections, but he thought it hard luck.A funeral in a country village is a public occasion. Friends andneighbors are expected to be present without invitation. Among thosewho assembled at the house were Mrs. Burke and Andy. They felt trulysorry for the death of Colonel Preston, who had been a friend to both.Mrs. Preston saw them enter, and, notwithstanding the solemnity of theoccasion, the thought intruded: "They're after the legacy, but theywill be disappointed. I've taken good care of that."Godfrey saw them, also, and his thought was a characteristic one:"What business has that Irish boy at my father's funeral? He ought toknow better than to poke himself in where he is not wanted."Even Godfrey, however, had the decency to let this thought remainunspoken. The services proceeded, and among those who followed on footin the funeral procession were Andy and his mother. It never occurredto them that they were intruding. They wanted to show respect for thememory of one who had been a friend to them.On the day after the funeral Squire Tisdale called at the house,invited by Mrs. Preston. The squire had a smattering of law, and oftenacted as executor in settling estates."I invited you to come here, Squire Tisdale," said Mrs. Preston, "tospeak about my affairs. Of course, it is very trying to me to think ofbusiness so soon after the death of my dear husband"--here shepressed her handkerchief to her tearless eyes--"but I feel it to be myduty to myself and my boy.""Of course," said the squire, soothingly. "We can't give way to ourfeelings, however much we want to.""That is my feeling," said Mrs. Preston, whose manner was wonderfullycool and collected, considering the grief which she desired to have itthought she experienced for her husband."Did Colonel Preston leave a will?" asked the squire."I don't think he did. He never mentioned making one to me. Did youever hear of his making any?""I can't say that I ever did. I suppose it will be best to search.""Won't it be more proper for you to make the search, Squire Tisdale?"said the widow. "I am an interested party.""Suppose we search together. You can tell me where your husband kepthis private papers.""Certainly. He kept them in his desk. I locked it as soon as he died;but here is the key. If there is a will, it is probably there.""Very probably. We shall soon ascertain, then."Squire Tisdale took the key, and Mrs. Preston led the way to her latehusband's desk. A momentary fear seized her."What if there was an earlier will, or two copies of the last?" shethought. "I ought to have made sure by looking over the other papers."But it was too late now. Besides, it seemed very improbable that thereshould be another will. Had there been an earlier one, it would,doubtless, have been destroyed on the drafting of the one she hadfound. She reassured herself, therefore, and awaited with tranquillitythe result of the search.The search was careful and thorough. Mrs. Preston desired that itshould be so. Knowing the wrong she had done to Andy and his mother,as well as the town, she was unnecessarily anxious to appear perfectlyfair, and assured Squire Tisdale that, had there been a will, itsprovisions should have been carried out to the letter."There is no will here," said the squire, after a careful search."I did not expect you would find one," said the widow; "but it wasnecessary to make sure.""Is there any other place where your husband kept papers?""We will look in the drawers and trunks," said Mrs. Preston; "but Idon't think any will be found."None was found."Can I do anything more for you, Mrs. Preston?" asked the squire."I should like your advice, Squire Tisdale. I am not used to business,and I would like the aid of your experience.""Willingly," said the squire, who felt flattered."As my husband left no will, I suppose the estate goes to my son andmyself?""Undoubtedly.""How ought I to proceed?""You should apply for letters of administration, which will enable youto settle up the property.""Will you help me to take the necessary steps?""Certainly.""I should like to settle the estate as rapidly as possible, as Iintend to remove to Boston.""Indeed? We shall be sorry to lose you. Can you not content yourselfhere?""Everything will remind me of my poor husband," said Mrs. Preston,with another application of the handkerchief to her still tearlesseyes.Squire Tisdale was impressed with the idea that she had more feelingthan he had thought."I didn't think of that," he said, sympathetically. "No doubt you areright."Mrs. Preston lost no time in applying for letters of administration."As soon as I get them," she said to herself, "I will lose no time inejecting that Irishwoman from the house my husband bought for her.I'll make her pay rent, too, for the time she has been in it."CHAPTER XXXIIMRS. PRESTON'S REVENGEAndy Burke was passing the house of Mrs. Preston, within a month afterColonel Preston's death, when Godfrey, who had not gone back toboarding school, showed himself at the front door."Come here!" said Godfrey, in an imperious tone.Andy turned his head, and paused."Who are you talking to?" he asked."To you, to be sure.""What's wanted?""My mother wants to see you.""All right; I'll come in.""You can go around to the back door," said Godfrey, who seemed to findpleasure in making himself disagreeable."I know I can, but I don't mean to," said Andy, walking up to thefront entrance, where Godfrey was standing."The back door is good enough for you," said the other, offensively."I shouldn't mind going to it if you hadn't asked me," said Andy."Just move away, will you?"Godfrey did not stir."Very well," said Andy, turning; "tell your mother you would not letme in.""Come in, if you want to," said Godfrey, at length, moving aside."I don't care much about it. I only came to oblige your mother.""Maybe you won't like what she has to say," said Godfrey, with adisagreeable smile."I'll soon know," said Andy.He entered the house, and Godfrey called upstairs: "Mother, the Burkeboy is here.""I'll be down directly," was the answer. "He can sit down."Andy sat down on a chair in the hall, not receiving an invitation toenter the sitting-room, and waited for Mrs. Preston to appear. Hewondered a little what she wanted with him, but thought it likely thatshe had some errand or service in which she wished to employ him. Hedid not know the extent of her dislike for him and his mother.After a while Mrs. Preston came downstairs. She was dressed in black,but showed no other mark of sorrow for the loss of her husband.Indeed, she was looking in better health than usual."You can come into the sitting-room," she said, coldly.Andy followed her, and so did Godfrey, who felt a malicious pleasurein hearing what he knew beforehand his mother intended to say."I believe your name is Andrew?" she commenced."Yes, ma'am.""Your mother occupies a house belonging to my late husband.""Yes, ma'am," answered Andy, who now began to guess at the object ofthe interview."I find, by examining my husband's papers, that she has paid no rentfor the last six months.""That's true," said Andy. "She offered to pay it, but Colonel Prestontold her he didn't want no rent from her. He said she could have itfor nothing.""That's a likely story," said Godfrey, with a sneer."It's a true story," said Andy, in a firm voice, steadily eying hisyoung antagonist."This may be true, or it may not be true," said Mrs. Preston, coldly."If true, I suppose my husband gave your mother a paper of some kind,agreeing to let her have the house rent-free.""She hasn't got any paper," said Andy."I thought not," said Godfrey, sneering. "You forgot to write herone.""Be quiet, Godfrey," said his mother. "I prefer to manage this mattermyself. Then, your mother has no paper to show in proof of what youassert?""No, ma'am. The colonel didn't think it was necessary. He just told mymother, when she first came with the rent, that she needn't troubleherself to come again on that errand. He said that she had nursed himwhen he was sick with the smallpox, and he'd never forget it, and thathe'd bought the house expressly for her.""I am aware that your mother nursed my husband in his sickness," saidMrs. Preston, coldly. "I also know that my husband paid her veryhandsomely for her services.""That's true, ma'am," said Andy. "He was a fine, generous man, thecolonel was, and I'll always say it.""There really seems no reason why, in addition to this compensation,your mother should receive a present of her rent. How much rent didshe pay before my husband bought the house?""Fifteen dollars a quarter.""Then she has not paid rent for six months. I find she owes myhusband's estate thirty dollars.""Colonel Preston told her she wasn't to pay it.""How do I know that?""My mother says it, and she wouldn't tell a lie," said Andy,indignantly."I have nothing to say as to that," said Mrs. Preston. "I am nowmanaging the estate, and the question rests with me. I decide thatyour mother has been sufficiently paid for her services, and I shallclaim rent for the last six months."Andy was silent for a moment. Then he spoke:"It may be so, Mrs. Preston. I'll speak to the doctor, and I'll do ashe says.""I don't know what the doctor has to do with the matter," said Mrs.Preston, haughtily."He wants to get an excuse for not paying," said Godfrey, with asneer."Mind your business," said Andy, excusably provoked."Do you hear that, mother?" said Godfrey. "Are you going to let thatbeggar insult me before your very face?""You have spoken very improperly to my son," said Mrs. Preston."He spoke very improperly to me at first," said Andy, sturdily."You do not appear to understand the respect due to me," said Mrs.Preston, with emphasis."If I've treated you disrespectfully, I'm sorry," said Andy; "butGodfrey mustn't insult me, and call me names.""We have had enough of this," said Mrs. Preston. "I have only torepeat that your mother is indebted to me for six months' rent--thirtydollars--which I desire she will pay as soon as possible. One thingmore: I must request her to find another home, as I have other plansfor the house she occupies.""You're not goin' to turn her out of her house, sure?" said Andy, insome dismay."It is not her house," said Mrs. Preston; though it occurred to herthat it might have been, if she had not suppressed the will. But, ofcourse, Andy knew nothing of this, nor did he suspect anything, sinceneither he nor his mother had the faintest idea of being remembered inColonel Preston's will, kind though he had been to them both in hislife."I know it isn't," said Andy; "but she's got used to it. I don't knowany other place we can get.""That is your lookout," said Mrs. Preston. "I have no doubt you canget in somewhere. As I said, the house is mine, and I have other viewsfor it.""Can't we stay till the end of the quarter, ma'am?""No; I wish to finish my business here as soon as possible, and thenshall go to Boston.""How long can we stay, then?""Till the first of the month.""That's only three days.""It is long enough to find another place. That is all I have to say,"and Mrs. Preston turned to go.Andy rose, and followed her, without a word. He saw that it would beof no use to appeal for more time. Her tone was so firm and determinedthat there evidently was no moving her."What will we do?" thought Andy, as he walked slowly and silentlyalong the road.He felt the need of consulting somebody older and more experiencedthan himself. Just in the nick of time he met Dr. Townley, in whosefriendship he felt confidence."Can you stop a minute, Dr. Townley?" he said. "I want to speak to youabout something.""I can spare two minutes, if you like, Andy," said the doctor,smiling.Andy explained the case."It is quite true," said the doctor. "Colonel Preston intended yourmother to pay no rent--he told me so himself; but, as your mother hasno written proof, I suppose you will have to pay it. Shall I lend youthe money?""No need, doctor. We've got money enough for that. But we must moveout in three days. Where shall we go?""I'll tell you. I own the small house occupied by Grant Melton. Hesets out for the West to-morrow, with his family. I'll let it to yourmother for the same rent she's been paying.""Thank you," said Andy, gratefully. "It's better than the house we'vebeen living in. It's a good change.""Perhaps you won't like me for a landlord so well as Mrs. Preston,"said the doctor, smiling."I'll risk it," said Andy.Two days afterward the transfer was made. Mrs. Preston wasdisappointed, and Godfrey still more so, to find their malice had donethe widow Burke no harm.By advice of the doctor, Andy deferred paying the thirty dollarsclaimed as rent, availing himself of the twelve months allowed for thepayment of debts due the estate of one deceased."If it was anybody else, I'd pay at once," said Andy; "but Mrs.Preston has treated us so meanly that I don't mean to hurry."The delay made Mrs. Preston angry, but she was advised that it wasquite legal.CHAPTER XXXIIIANDY LOSES HIS PLACEAndy and his mother moved into Dr. Townley's cottage. It was rather animprovement upon the house in which they had lived hitherto, but,then, there was this great difference: For the one they had no rent topay, but for the other they paid fifty dollars rent. Dr. Townley wouldgladly have charged nothing, but he was a comparatively poor man, andcould not afford to be as generous as his heart would have dictated.He had a fair income, being skillful and in good practice, but he hada son in college, and his expenses were a considerable drain upon hisfather's purse. Still, with the money saved, and Andy's weeklyearnings, the Burkes were able to live very comfortably and still paythe rent. But a real misfortune was in store for Andy.Miss Sophia Grant was taken sick with lung fever. The sickness lastedfor some weeks, and left her considerably debilitated."What do you think of Sophia, Dr. Townley?" asked Priscilla,anxiously. "She remains weak, and she has a bad cough. I am feelingalarmed about her.""I'll tell you what I think, Miss Priscilla," said the doctor, "thoughI am sorry to do it. The fact is, the air here is altogether toobracing for your sister. She will have to go to some inland town,where the east winds are not felt.""Then I must go, too," said Miss Priscilla. "We have lived togetherfrom girlhood, and we cannot be separated.""I supposed you would be unwilling to leave her, so I am afraid wemust make up our minds to lose you both.""Do you think, doctor, that Sophia will, by and by, be strong enoughto return here?""I am afraid not. The effects of lung fever are always felt for a longtime. She will improve, no doubt, but a return to this harsh airwould, I fear, bring back her old trouble.""I asked because I wanted to know whether it would be best to keepthis place. After what you have told me, I shall try to sell it.""I am truly sorry, Miss Priscilla.""So am I, Dr. Townley. I don't expect any place will seem so much likehome as this.""Have you any particular place that you think of going to?""Yes; I have a niece married in a small town near Syracuse, New YorkState. They don't have east winds there. I'll get Priscilla (she'snamed after me) to hunt up a cottage that we can live in, and moveright out there. I suppose we'd better go soon?""Better go at once. Weak lungs must be humored.""Then I'll write to Priscilla to get me a boarding house, and we'llstart next week."There was one person whom this removal was likely to affect seriously,and this was our young hero."I hope Andy'll be able to get a place," said Priscilla, after she hadcommunicated the doctor's orders to her sister."Just so, Priscilla. He's a good boy.""I will give him a good recommendation.""Just so. Does he know it?""No. I will call him in and tell him, so that he can be looking outfor another position.""Just so."Andy answered the call of Miss Priscilla. He had been sawing wood, andthere was sawdust in his sleeves."How long have you been with us, Andy?" asked his mistress."Over a year, ma'am.""I wish I could keep you for a year to come.""Can't you?" asked Andy, startled."No, Andy.""What's the matter, Miss Priscilla? Have I done anything wrong?""No, Andy. We are both of us quite satisfied with you.""You haven't lost any money, ma'am, have you? I'll work for less, ifyou can't afford to pay as much as you've been paying.""Thank you, Andy, but it isn't that. My sister's lungs are weak, andDr. Townley has ordered her to move to a less exposed place. We aregoing to move away from the town.""I'm sorry," said Andy, and he was, for other reasons than because hewas about to lose a good place."We shall miss you, Andy.""Just so," chimed in Miss Sophia, with a cough."You see how weak my sister's lungs are. It's on her account we aregoing.""Shan't you come back again, ma'am?""No, Andy. The doctor says it will never be safe for us to do so. Ihope you will get a good place.""I hope so, ma'am; but you needn't think of that.""We are prepared to give you a good recommendation. We feel perfectlysatisfied with you in every way.""Just so," said Sophia."Thank you, ma'am, and you, too, Miss Sophia. I've tried to do my dutyfaithfully by you.""And you have, Andy.""How soon do you go, ma'am?""Next week, if we can get away. The doctor says we can't get away toosoon. So you had better be looking around, to see if you can get aplace somewhere.""I will, ma'am; but I'll stay with you till the last day. You'll needme to pack up for you.""Yes, we shall. To-morrow I'll write you the recommendation.""Thank you, ma'am."Andy did not sleep as much as usual that night. His wages were themain support of his mother and sister, and he could think of no otherplace in the village where he was likely to be employed. He had alittle money saved up, but he didn't like the idea of spending it.Besides, it would not last long."I wish Dr. Townley wanted a boy," thought Andy. "I'd rather work forthe doctor than for anybody else in the village. He's a nice man, andhe cares just as much for poor folks as he does for rich folks. I amsure he likes me better than he does Godfrey Preston."But Dr. Townley already had a boy, whom he did not like to turn off.Nor could he have afforded to pay Andy as high wages as he hadreceived from the Misses Grant. There really seemed to be no vacantplace in the village for our young hero to fill, and, of course, thistroubled him.Next week the Misses Grant got away from the village. They gave Andyas a present an old-fashioned silver watch, about the size and shapeof a turnip. Andy was glad to get it, old-fashioned as it was, and hethanked them warmly.The day afterward he was walking slowly along the village street, whenhe came upon Godfrey Preston strutting along, with an air ofimportance. He and his mother had removed to Boston, but they werevisiting the town on a little business."Hello, there!" said Godfrey, halting."Hello!" said Andy."You've lost your place, haven't you?" asked Godfrey, with a sneer."Yes.""How are you going to live?""By eating, I expect," answered Andy, shortly."If you can get anything to eat, you mean?""We got enough so far.""Perhaps you won't have, long. You may have to go to the poorhouse.""When I do, I shall find you there.""What do you mean?" demanded Godfrey, angrily."I mean I shan't go there till you do.""You're proud for a beggar.""I'm more of a gentleman than you are.""I'd thrash you, only I won't demean myself by doing it.""That's lucky, or you might get thrashed yourself.""You're only an Irish boy.""I'm proud of that same. You won't find me go back on my country."Godfrey walked away. Somehow, he could never get the better of Andy."I hope I'll see you begging in rags, some day," he thought tohimself.But boys like Andy are not often reduced to such a point.CHAPTER XXXIVTHE WILL AT LASTThe next three months passed very unsatisfactorily for Andy. In asmall country town like that in which he lived there was littleopportunity for a boy, however industrious, to earn money. The farmersgenerally had sons of their own, or were already provided withassistants, and there was no manufacturing establishment in thevillage to furnish employment to those who didn't like agriculture.Andy had some idea of learning the carpenter trade, there being acarpenter who was willing to take an apprentice, but, unfortunately,he was unwilling to pay any wages for the first year--only boardingthe apprentice--and our hero felt, for his mother's sake, that itwould not do to make such an engagement.When the three months were over, the stock of money which Andy and hismother had saved up was almost gone. In fact, he had not enough leftto pay the next quarter's rent to Dr. Townley.Things were in this unsatisfactory state, when something happened thathad a material effect upon Andy's fortunes, and, as my readers will beglad to know, for their improvement.To explain what it was, I must go back to a period shortly beforeColonel's Preston's death. One day he met the doctor in the street,and stopped to speak to him."Dr. Townley," he said, "I have a favor to ask of you.""I shall be very glad to serve you, Colonel Preston," said the doctor.Thereupon Colonel Preston drew from his inside pocket a sealedenvelope of large size."I want you to take charge of this for me," he said."Certainly," said the doctor, in some surprise."Please read what I have written upon the envelope."The doctor, his attention called to the envelope, read, inscribed inlarge, distinct characters:"Not to be opened till six months after my death.""I see you want an explanation," said the colonel. "Here it is--thepaper contained in this envelope is an important one. I won't tell youwhat it is. When you come to open it, it will explain itself.""But, colonel, you are likely to live as long as I. In that case, Ican't follow your directions.""Of course, we can't tell the duration of our lives. Still, I thinkyou will outlive me. If not, I shall reclaim the paper. Meanwhile, Ishall be glad to have you take charge of it for me.""Of course I will. It is a slight favor to ask.""It may prove important. By the way, there is no need of tellinganyone, unless, perchance, your wife. I don't want to force you tokeep anything secret from her. Mrs. Townley, I know, may be dependedupon.""I think she may. Well, Colonel Preston, set your mind at rest. I willtake care of the paper."When Colonel Preston died, not long afterward, the doctor naturallythought of the paper, and, as no will was left, it occurred to himthat this might be a will; but, in that case, he couldn't understandwhy he should have been enjoined to keep it six months before openingit. On the whole, he concluded that it was not a will.Seated at the supper table, about this time, Mrs. Townley said,suddenly:"Henry, how long is it since Colonel Preston died?""Let me see," said the doctor, thoughtfully. "It is--yes, it is sixmonths to-morrow.""Then it is time for you to open that envelope he gave into yourcharge.""So it is. My dear, your feminine curiosity inspired that thought,"said the doctor, smiling."Perhaps you are right. I own I am a little inquisitive in thematter.""I am glad you mentioned it. I have so much on my mind that I shouldhave let the day pass, and I should be sorry not to fulfill to theletter the promise I made to my friend.""Have you any suspicion as to the nature of the document?""I thought it might be a will; but, if so, I can't understand why adelay of six months should have been interposed.""Colonel Preston may have had his reasons. Possibly he did not fullytrust his wife's attention to his requests.""It may be so. I am afraid his married life was not altogetherharmonious. Mrs. Preston always struck me as a very selfish woman.""No doubt of that.""She evidently regarded herself as superior to the rest of us.""In that respect Godfrey is like her. He is a self-conceited,disagreeable young jackanapes. I wouldn't give much for his chances ofhonorable distinction in life. I'll tell you of a boy who will, in myopinion, beat him in the race of life.""Who is that?""Andy Burke.""Andy is a good boy, but I am afraid the family is doing poorly now.""So I fear. The, fact is, there doesn't appear to be much opening fora lad like Andy in this village.""I hear that Mr. Graves, the storekeeper, who is getting old, wants toget a boy, or young man, with a small capital to take an interest inhis business, and, eventually, succeed him.""That would be a good chance for Andy, if he had the small capital;but he probably hasn't ten dollars in the world.""That's a pity.""If I were a capitalist, I wouldn't mind starting him myself; but asyou, my dear, are my most precious property, and are not readilyconvertible into cash, I don't quite see my way to do anything toassist him.""I didn't think of you, Henry. Country doctors are not likely to getrich. But I thought Colonel Preston, who seemed to take an interest inthe boy, might do something for him.""If he had lived, he might have done so--probably he would. But Mrs.Preston and Godfrey hate the Burkes like poison, for no good reasonthat I know of, and there is no chance of help from that quarter.""I should think not."The next day, Dr. Townley, immediately after breakfast, drew theenvelope already referred to from among his private papers, and,breaking the seal, opened it.To his surprise and excitement, he discovered that the inclosure wasthe last will and testament of his deceased friend. Accompanying itwas the following note:    "MY DEAR FRIEND, DR. TOWNLEY: This is the duplicate of a will    executed recently, and expresses my well-considered wishes as    to the disposition of my property. The original will may have    been found and executed before you open this envelope. In    that case, of course, this will be of no value, and you can    destroy it. But I am aware that valuable papers are liable to    loss or injury, and, therefore, I deem it prudent to place    this duplicate in your possession, that, if the other be    lost, you may see it carried into execution. I have named you    my executor, and am sure, out of regard to me, you will    accept the trust, and fulfill it to the best of your ability.    I have always felt the utmost confidence in your friendship,    and this will account for my troubling you on the present    occasion.                                  "Your friend,                                       "Anthony Preston."From this letter Dr. Townley turned to the perusal of the will. Thecontents filled him with equal surprise and pleasure."Five thousand dollars to Andy Burke!" he repeated. "That is capital!It will start the boy in life, and with his good habits it will makehim sure of a competence by and by. With half of it he can buy aninterest in Graves' store, and the balance will, if well invested,give him a handsome addition to his income. Then there's the bequestfor the town library--a capital idea, that! It will do a great deal tomake the town attractive, and be a powerful agency for refining andeducating the people."Just then Mrs. Townley, who knew what her husband was about, came intothe room."Well, Henry," she said, "is the paper important?""I should say it was. It is Colonel Preston's last will andtestatment.""Is it possible? How does he leave his property?""He leaves five thousand dollars for a town library.""Does he remember Andy Burke?""He leaves him five thousand dollars, and gives his mother the housethey used to live in.""That's splendid! But what will Mrs. Preston say?""Well, that remains to be seen," said the doctor, laughing.CHAPTER XXXVMRS. PRESTON IS UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISEDDr. Townley thought it best to consult with the town authorities as tothe course to be pursued, since, as it appeared, the town wasinterested in the will. It was decided that the doctor and Mr. Graves,who was the Chairman of the Selectmen, should go to Boston the nextday and inform Mrs. Preston of the discovery of the will. Until afterthis interview it was deemed best not to mention the matter to Andy orhis mother.Mrs. Preston was established in a showy house at the South End. Atlast she was living as she desired to do. She went to the theater andthe opera, and was thinking whether she could afford to set up acarriage. Godfrey she had placed at a private school, and was anxiousto have him prepare for admission to Harvard College, but in this hopeshe seemed destined to be disappointed. Godfrey wanted to see life andenjoy himself, and had no intention of submitting to the drudgery ofhard study."Godfrey," said his mother one morning, "I have received a letter fromyour teacher, complaining that you don't work.""I'm not going to work myself to death," answered Godfrey."I don't expect you to hurt yourself with work, but I want you to goto college.""Oh, well, I'll get in somehow.""Don't you want to stand well as a scholar?" she asked."I leave that to the poor fellows that have got to work for a living.I am rich.""You may lose your money.""I don't mean to.""Suppose you do?""Then I will go to work.""I should like to have you graduate well at college and then studylaw. You might get into Congress," said his mother."I guess I'll know enough for that," said Godfrey, carelessly. "I wantto have a good time."That was not the worst of it, however. He extorted from his mother alarge allowance, which he spent at bars and billiard saloons, and oneday was brought home drunk by a schoolfellow."Oh, Godfrey, how can you do so?" exclaimed the selfish woman, foronce fairly alarmed on another's account."Hush up, old woman!" hiccoughed Godfrey.Mrs. Preston was mortified to think this should be said to her beforeGodfrey's schoolmate."He does not know what he is saying," she said, apologetically."Yes, I do," persisted Godfrey. "I'm a--a gen'leman's son. I don'twant you to interfere with gen'leman's son."He was put to bed, and awoke the next morning with a splittingheadache. It was the morning of the day which the doctor and Mr.Graves had chosen to call on Mrs. Preston. She was preparing to goout, when a servant came upstairs to announce that two gentlemen werein the parlor, and wanted to see her."Two gentlemen! What do they look like, Nancy?""One of 'em looks like he was from the country, mum."This referred to Mr. Graves, who did have a rustic look. The doctorwould readily have passed for a Bostonian."Did they give their names?""No, mum.""I will go down directly. I suppose they won't stay long."Mrs. Preston sailed into the parlor with the air of a city lady, asshe proudly imagined, but stopped short in some surprise when sherecognized her visitors. Of course, she did not suspect the nature oftheir business.Dr. Townley arose as she entered."Good-morning, Mrs. Preston," he said. "I hope I find you well?""I am quite well," said Mrs. Preston, coldly, for she had never likedthe doctor. She had an unpleasant feeling that he understood her, andwas not among her admirers. "Good-morning, Mr. Graves. You come to thecity occasionally?""I don't often get time to come up, but the doctor thought I ought tocome.""Indeed! I am sorry to say that I am just going out.""I must ask you to defer going till we have communicated ourbusiness," said the doctor."Business?" repeated Mrs. Preston, seating herself in some surprise."Yes--business of importance. In short, your husband's will has cometo light.""My husband's will!" exclaimed Mrs. Preston. "I thought----"She checked herself suddenly. She was about to say, "I thought I haddestroyed it," and that would have let the cat out of the bag with avengeance."You thought that he left no will," said the doctor, finishing thesentence for her. "He really left two----""Two!""That's it--he executed two--exactly alike. One he left in my hands.""That is a likely story!" said Mrs. Preston, excitedly. "If that isthe case, why, I ask, have we heard nothing of this before?""Because it was contained in an envelope, which I was requested not toopen for six months after his decease. The time having expired----""May I ask what are the provisions of this pretended will?" demandedMrs. Preston, in visible excitement."Mrs. Preston," said the doctor, with dignity, "you appear to forgetthat you are addressing a gentleman. I am above fabricating a will, asyou seem to insinuate. As to the provisions, it leaves five thousanddollars to the town for the establishment of a public library, andfive thousand dollars to Andy Burke, besides the small house in whichshe used to live to the widow Burke."The worst had come. In spite of her criminal act, she must lose theten thousand dollars; and, worst of all, those whom she hated anddespised were to profit by her loss."This is simply outrageous, Dr. Townley," she said."You are speaking of your husband's will, Mrs. Preston.""I don't believe he made it.""There can be no doubt of it. Mr. Graves has examined it, and he andmyself are so familiar with the handwriting of your husband that wehave no hesitation in pronouncing the will genuine.""Colonel Preston must have been insane if he really made such a will.""I was his medical adviser," said Dr. Townley, quietly, "and I neverdetected the least sign of an unsound mind.""The fact of robbing his wife and child to enrich an Irishwoman andher son is proof enough of his insanity.""Pardon me, madam, but such bequests are made every day. Outside oftheir legacies your husband left ample fortune, and there is no dangerof your being impoverished.""Did you bring the will with you?""No. I did not feel like incurring the risk.""I shall contest the will," said Mrs. Preston, passionately."I would not advise you to. The proof of its genuineness isoverwhelming. I suppose you never saw the other will?"Mrs. Preston, at this unexpected question, in spite of her strongnerves, turned pale, and faltered:"Of course not," she said, after a slight pause."Your husband asserts positively in a note to me that he made one,"said the doctor, bending his eyes searchingly upon her, for hesuspected the truth, and that it was distrust of his wife that ledColonel Preston to take the precaution he had done. "Its disappearanceis mysterious.""What do you mean?" cried Mrs. Preston, sharply, and not altogetherwithout alarm."I meant only to express my surprise.""If your business is over, I will go out.""I have only this to say, that, being named in the will as executor, Ishall take immediate measures to have the will admitted to probate.Should you make up your mind to contest it, you can give me due noticethrough your legal adviser. In that case," he added, significantly,"the question of the disappearance of the other will will come up.""I will consult my lawyer," said Mrs. Preston.Though she said this, her determination was already made. "Consciencemakes cowards of us all," and the doctor's last hint alarmed her somuch that she decided to make no opposition to the setting up of thewill. But it was a bitter pill to swallow."Graves," said Dr. Townley, as he left the house, "that womandestroyed the other will.""Do you think so?" asked Mr. Graves, startled."I feel sure of it. Let me predict also that she will not contest thiswill. She is afraid to."And the doctor was right.CHAPTER XXXVIALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELLAndy was quite unconscious of the good fortune which had come to him.Though a manly and stout-hearted boy, he was, in fact, gettingdiscouraged. He was willing and anxious to work, but there seemed tobe no work for him to do. He would have left home some time since totry his fortune elsewhere, but for the entreaties of his mother, whodidn't like to lose him.In the morning after Dr. Townley's visit to Boston, our hero knockedat the doctor's front door."Is Dr. Townley at home?" he asked."Yes, Andy," said the doctor, who overheard the inquiry. "Come rightin. You're just the boy I want to see."Andy entered, twirling his hat awkwardly in his hand."Good-morning, Andy," said the doctor, cordially. "Take a seat.""Thank you, sir," said Andy, but did not sit down."What is the matter? You are looking rather blue this morning.""Faith, doctor, and that's the way I feel entirely.""You're not sick, are you? Let me feel your pulse.""No, I'm not sick, but it's discouraged I am.""Why should a stout boy in good health be discouraged?""I can't get any work to do, and I'm afraid we'll all starve.""It strikes me," said the doctor, fixing his eyes on Andy, enjoyingthe effect of his intended announcement, "that I wouldn't talk ofstarving, if I were as rich as you are, Andy.""As rich as me?" echoed Andy. "Shure, doctor, you're jokin'.""Not at all.""Why, I haven't got but seventy-five cents in the world.""Now it's you that are joking, Andy.""I wish I was," sighed Andy."Why, I had it on good authority that you were worth five thousanddollars."Andy stared in earnest."I see you're laughin' at me, doctor," he said, suspecting that Dr.Townley was making game of him."No, I am not. I am in earnest.""Who told you such a big falsehood as that, now?" asked our hero,bewildered."Perhaps I dreamed that somebody told me Colonel Preston had left youfive thousand dollars in his will.""Are you jokin'? Is it true?" asked Andy, eagerly, something in thedoctor's face telling him that he really meant what he said."Maybe I dreamed, too, that the colonel left your mother the house sheused to live in.""Is it true, doctor? Tell me, quick!" said Andy, trembling withexcitement."Yes, my boy, it's all true, and I'm glad to be the first tocongratulate you on your good fortune."He held out his hand, which our hero seized, and then, unable torepress his exultation, threw up his cap to the ceiling and indulgedin an extempore dance, the doctor meanwhile looking on with benevolentgratification."Excuse me, doctor; I couldn't help it," he panted."It's all right, Andy. Are you discouraged now?""Divil a bit, doctor. It's wild I am with joy.""And you don't think of starving yet, eh, Andy?""I'll wait a bit. But why didn't I know before?""Sit down, and I'll tell you all about it."So Andy heard the account, which need not be repeated."Now," continued the doctor, "I'll tell you what plan I have for you.Mr. Graves wants to take a boy into his store who will buy an interestin the business and become his partner. He thinks well of you, and iswilling to take you. What do you say?""I'll do whatever you think best, doctor.""Then I think this is a good opening for you. Mr. Graves wants toretire from business before long. Probably by the time you aretwenty-one he will leave everything in your hands. You will be paidweekly wages and perhaps be entitled to a portion of the profits--morethan enough to support you all comfortably. What do you say? Shall wehave a new firm in the village?                       "GRAVES & BURKE."Andy's eyes sparkled with proud anticipation. It was so far above anydream he had ever formed."It's what I'd like above all things," he said. "Oh, what will mothersay? I must go and tell her.""Go, by all means, Andy, and when you have told her, come back, andI'll go over with you to Mr. Graves' store, and we'll talk over thearrangements with him."Mrs. Burke's delight at her own success and that of Andy may beimagined. She, too, had been getting despondent, and it seemed almostlike a fairy tale to find herself the owner of a house, and her boylikely to be taken into partnership with the principal trader in thevillage. She invoked blessings on the memory of Colonel Preston,through whose large-hearted generosity this had come to pass, butcould not help speculating on what Mrs. Preston would say. Sheunderstood very well that she would be very angry.Mrs. Preston did not dispute the will. She might have done so, but forher fear that her own criminal act would be brought to light. Godfrey,who was even more disturbed than she was at the success of "that lowIrish boy," begged her to do it, but in this case she did not yield tohis entreaties. She had never dared to take him into confidencerespecting her destruction of the other will.While we are upon this subject, we may as well trace out the futurecareer of Mrs. Preston. Some years later she was induced, by theexpectation of aiding her social standing, to marry an adventurer whoappeared to be doing a flourishing business as a State Street broker.By spurious representations, he managed to get hold of her property,and to be appointed Godfrey's guardian. The result may be foreseen. Hemanaged to spend or waste the whole and when Godfrey was twenty-one,he and his mother were penniless. Andy, who was now solerepresentative of the firm of Graves & Burke, and in receipt of anexcellent income, heard of the misfortunes of his old enemy, and outof regard to the memory of his old benefactor voluntarily offered Mrs.Preston an allowance of five hundred dollars. It cost her pride agreat deal to accept this favor from the boy she had looked down uponas "only an Irish boy," but her necessity was greater than her pride,and she saw no other way of escaping the poorhouse. So sheungraciously accepted. But Andy did not care for thanks. He felt thathe was doing his duty, and he asked no other reward than thatconsciousness. Mrs. Preston was allowed to make her home, rent free,in Mrs. Burke's old house, Andy having built a better and morecommodious one, in which he had installed his mother as mistress. Mrs.Preston grew old fast, in appearance, and fretted without ceasing forthe fortune and position which she had lost. Her husband left her, andhas not since been heard of. As for Godfrey, Andy secured him apassage to California, where he led a disreputable life. There is arumor that he was killed in a drunken brawl at Sacramento not longsince, but I have not been able to learn whether this is true or not.His loss of fortune had something to do with his going to the bad, butI am afraid, with his character and tendencies, that neither inprosperity nor in adversity would he have built up a good character,or led an honorable career. His course had been, in all respects, fardifferent from that of our hero, who, already prosperous, seems likelyto go on adding to his wealth, and growing in the esteem of the bestportion of the community. His success, aided, indeed, by good fortune,has served to demonstrate the favorable effects of honesty, industry,and good principles, upon individual success. He is not the first, norwill he be the last, to achieve prosperity and the respect of thecommunity, though beginning life as "only an Irish boy."THE ENDTranscriber's comments:Spelling has been left as in the original book.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.

He has sailed in a shipalmost all over the world. Such a host of stories as he can tell!Why, I do believe if he could find little boys and girls to talk to,he would begin in the morning as soon as he had got through hisbreakfast, and do nothing but tell stories about what he has seen,until it was time to go to bed at night. I don't know but he wouldwant to stop once or twice to eat. Jack loves a good dinner as wellas anybody.Jack is the one that you see in the picture, with his pea-jacket on,and a book in his hand. He is in a ship, telling his stories now tothat boy sitting on a coil of rope. See, the boy is looking right atthe old man, hearing all he says. I wonder what Jack is talking aboutnow. He must be telling one of his best stories, I guess; for the boylifts his head up, as much as to say, "Dear me! who ever heard ofsuch a thing!"Jack is a good man. He is not like a great many sailors that I haveseen. He does not use bad words. He never drinks rum, or any thing ofthe kind. Sailors are apt to swear; but Jack Mason never swears. Heis a Christian: he loves to pray and read his Bible. The book which heholds in his hand, as he is talking to that boy, is a Bible. He oftenhas a Bible in his jacket pocket, when he is on board of his ship; andonce in a while he stops telling stories about what he has seen, andreads some of the stories in that good book.When I was a little boy, Jack fell from the high mast of the ship, andhurt himself so badly that he had to stay at home a long time afterthat. Poor fellow! he did not like to be shut up in the house. It washard work for him. But he could not go out, until his hip got well.When he was able to sit up in a chair, I used to go and see him, andhear him tell his stories. I did not go every day, because my motherthought I had better not go every day. But I went as often as shewould let me go, and staid as long as she would let me stay.Jack was always glad to see me, and glad to tell me stories. I wasalways glad to hear his stories. Some sailors, who have spent a greatdeal of time on board of a ship, and have seen a great many places,are not good men. They do not always tell the truth. So, when theytell stories about what they saw where they went, we do not knowwhether to believe them or not. But Jack Mason was a good man, and Iknew he would not tell me what was not true.Shall I tell you some of the stories that this good old sailor told mewhen he had to stay at home, because he had broken his hip? I think Ican remember some worth telling again."O yes, Mr. Thinker, tell us all the stories the old sailor told you.""No, I cannot do that. I cannot remember them all.""Well, tell us all you do remember.""I will see about it. I will tell you some of them, at any rate. Letme see, what story shall I tell first? Shall I tell you his storyabout what he saw once, when he sailed a great way north? I guess Iwill."[Illustration]JACK MASON'S VISIT TO THE NORTH SEA.If you should go a great way north, you would find it very cold. Thefurther you go north, the colder it is. I went so far that way onetime, that I got almost frozen. The ship I sailed in came close toan iceberg once, and we all thought for a while that the ship wouldstrike the iceberg. If it had struck, it would have been broken allin pieces, and we should have been drowned or frozen, every one of us.God was kind and good to us, though. The wind was blowing very hard,and right toward the iceberg. But just as we had got almost up to it,the wind changed, and blew us away from it.But I forgot that you do not know what an iceberg is. It is a greathill of ice. In the North Sea, these ice-hills are often as high asyour church, and sometimes a great deal higher. These hills of iceare floating along the water there, and when it is foggy or dark, thesailors cannot always see them. So sometimes the ship strikes them,and is dashed to pieces. Sometimes it gets between two of theseice-hills, and gets crushed, as if it was a little boat. Then the menin the ship have to get out, and jump upon one of the ice-hills. Butthey are pretty likely to be frozen to death then.[Illustration: The Indians.]THE INDIANS.In that cold country I saw some Indians. They were dressed in skins.I never saw such dirty-looking men and women before in all my life,and I have never seen any such since. They had never seen a shipbefore, I should think. I thought they did not know much more thanthe white bears. Why, they would sell almost all the clothes they hadon, if we would give them a few pieces of glass, or a nail or two.One of the women who came to the ship had a little girl about fouryears old, and she said she would give us that girl, if we would lether have a tin pan which she saw.These Indians tie their children on their backs, when they have towalk a great way. They licked the oil on the outside of our lamps,just as a dog or a cat would have done. Oh, what dirty people! Theyeat their meat raw. We killed a seal one day, and our captain gave itto one of the young women. She took it, and bit it into pieces withher teeth. Then she passed it round to the rest of the Indians, andthey all helped eat it.[Illustration]THE WHITE BEARS.There are a great many white bears in that country. Sometimes you cansee two or three of them sitting on one of these ice-hills. How theyever got there, I am sure I cannot tell. I guess they went out on theice only a little way from the shore, to get something which they sawwas good to eat; and while they were on the ice, it started off, andthey could not get to the shore again.One of the men who sailed in the same ship with me, told me a storyabout a white bear, which made me laugh for an hour after I heard it.He said he was in a small boat with another sailor once, about a mileaway from the ship. I forget what they went out in the boat for, but Isuppose the captain of the ship sent them out for something. They wererowing along in the boat, and they came close to an iceberg. They sawsomething alive on the iceberg, but they could not make out what itwas: they did not know but it was a man. But they came a little nearerto the great ice-hill, and they soon found out what sort of a thingthere was on it. _Splash_ something went into the water; and in aminute a great white bear jumped into the boat, as wet as a drownedrat.Well, the sailors thought they had got to die, sure enough. What couldthey do? The first thing that they thought of, was to try to kill thebear with their oars. But they soon gave that up. They saw that thebear was too large and strong to be killed in that way. The next thingthey thought of doing, was to jump into the water. But they knew theywould die if they did that. What should they do? "I wonder which of usthe old fellow will take first," one of the men said to the other.Each of them had his oar ready, so that when the bear made a spring atthem, he would get his ears boxed pretty sharply. That was all theycould do.Well, the bear did not seem to be at all in a hurry. The first thinghe did, after he got into the boat, was to shake himself as hard as hecould, to get the water out of his coat. After that, he walked slowlyto one end of the boat, just as if he was quite at home there, and laydown upon a coat which one of the men had brought along, and went tosleep.The sailors saw then that all they had to do was to row the bear tothe shore. So they went to work. When they got to the ship, thecaptain and all the sailors laughed a good deal, you may be sure. Theshore was not far off. The sailors rowed until the boat touched theshore, and the bear got out, and walked slowly away. He did not somuch as thank the men for the ride he had been taking. But the menwere glad to get rid of him, thanks or no thanks.[Illustration]CATCHING WHALES.I went in a whale-ship once. I was gone from home that time more thanthree years. When we came back, we had our large ship all full of oiland whalebone. We got the oil and the whalebone out of the whaleswhich we had caught. Whales, you know, are very large fish. Theysometimes get two or three hundred barrels of oil from one singlewhale.I never shall forget what a long chase I had with a whale once. ShallI tell you about it, little friend? There was a man in the ship whowas looking out for whales. In a whale-ship there is always one manwho gets up as high as he can, and keeps a bright look-out all roundfor whales. Whales do not stay under water all the time. The trout,and the shad, and the eel, and most other kinds of fish can stay underwater all the time. They cannot live out of the water only a fewminutes, and I suppose they feel almost as bad out of the water as wedo in it. But the whale wants to come up to the top of the water. Hewants to come up to breathe. Well, all at once, the man who waslooking out the day I speak of, when I had such a run, sung out asloud as he could, "There she blows!" We all knew what that meant. Thatis what they always say when they see a whale. It means, "There is awhale come up to breathe." This whale was a great way off. I shouldthink he was a mile from the ship.Well, the captain told some of us to get into a boat, and to go outafter the whale. We did so. The boats are always kept ready, and ittakes only a minute to let the boat down, and start off. We rowed asfast as we could, until we came up near where the whale was lying.Oh, what a large whale! As soon as the boat got near enough, one manthrew two harpoons at the whale, and they both stuck fast in hisflesh. A harpoon is a long and sharp iron, made like a spear, so thatwhen it strikes the whale, it goes in deep, and you cannot pull itout. The harpoon is fastened to a long rope, and the rope is tied tothe boat.As soon as the whale felt these irons in his side, he began to run.I never knew before that a whale could swim so fast. It took him onlya very little while to run out with all the loose rope; and our boatwent through the water pretty fast, you may be sure. I was afraid thewhale would take it into his head to dive down towards the bottom. Ifhe had gone down, we should have gone with him, unless we could havecut the rope. But he did not go down. Away we went, as fast as if wehad been on a railroad. He was all the time taking us further from theship. "Well," we thought, "what is going to become of us!" The whaledid not seem to care any thing about that. I suppose he thought thatwas our look-out, and not his.But the fellow got tired out by and by. He had bled so much, that hebegan to grow faint. At last he went so slow, that we rowed up to him,and stabbed him with a long knife. He died pretty soon after that,and we got more than two hundred barrels of oil out of him.Catching whales seems a cruel business to you. It is a cruel business.I never liked it. But somebody must do it. The butcher who killsoxen, and sheep, and calves, has to be cruel. But we must havebutchers. We must have people to kill whales, though you never willcatch me chasing after a whale again, as long as my name is JackMason.Whales do not always run like the one I have told you about. Sometimesthey fight. After they are struck with the harpoon, they lift theirtail, or _fluke_, as they call it, and strike the boat so hard as todash it in pieces. Then the poor sailors have to swim to the ship ifthey can. If they cannot, and if there is no other boat near them thatthey can get into, they must drown.I once saw a whale that had been struck with a harpoon come up closeto the ship, and give it such a blow with his fluke, that he tore thecopper off at a great rate, and broke a thick plank in half a dozenpieces.[Illustration][Illustration: The Indian, with his bow and arrows.]MORE INDIANS.When I went in the whale-ship, I saw another tribe of Indians, thatwere very different from those I told you of before. They knew morethan those Indians. They used bows and arrows; and you would have beenpleased to see how they would hit a mark a great way off, with theirarrows.One of them, who had a name so long that I will not try to speak it,used to come every day to our ship, when we were lying near the shore.He liked pieces of glass, and nails and tin, and things of that kind,quite as well as the other Indians I told you of. He had seen whitemen before, so he was not at all afraid of us. I suppose that almostall the white men he had seen before used rum and tobacco. He askedall our sailors for these two things, and kept asking every day. I amsorry to say that some of the men gave him some rum once in a while,and one day he drank so much that he got drunk. Poor man! He was notso much to blame, I think, as the bad sailors that gave him the rum.What do you think about it?This man would dive in the water further than anybody I ever sawbefore or since. Some of the sailors used to throw pieces of tin intovery deep water, and tell him he might have them if he would dive andbring them up. He was so fond of such things, that he would alwaysgladly dive to get them.I once saw him dive for an old worn-out knife. The water was very deepwhere it was thrown. It was so deep that none of us thought he wouldget it. He went down, and staid a long, long time. We thought he neverwould come up again. The sailor that threw the knife into the waterbegan to be sorry he had done it, because he thought the poor Indianwas drowned. But, by and by, he came up again, with the knife in hismouth. He had been hunting after the knife on the bottom of the sea.These Indians had boats which were made of the bark of trees. Theywere so light, that an Indian could carry one of them on his shoulder.The man who used to come to the ship so often, brought his littlegirl with him one day. She was not more than six or seven years old.She had never seen any white men before, and at first she was afraidof us all. But when she saw that the white folks would not hurt herany more than the Indians would, she liked us very well, and wanted tostay with us all the time. The captain showed her his watch, and shelooked at it a long time. She thought she had never seen so strange athing before. "Is it alive?" she asked her father. He could not tellwhether it was alive or not, any more than the little girl could.The captain liked the little girl very well. He wanted to take herhome with him. So he asked her father if his little girl might go agreat way off, where the white men lived. The Indians could not talklike us. They could talk, but they did not use the same words. Thecaptain made out to tell the Indian what he wanted, by using signs,just as he would have done if he had been talking with a deaf and dumbman. And what do you think the father of that little girl said, whenhe knew that the captain wanted to take the girl home with him? Ifanybody should ask your father if he would let you go away and nevercome back again, you can tell what your father would say. He wouldsay, "No, I cannot spare my dear little child."[Illustration]But the Indian said, "Yes, give me some money, and you can take mylittle girl, and carry her away with you. I have got more girls in myhouse." The little Indian girl wanted to go with us, so the captaingave her father some money, and when the ship sailed, he took heralong with him. But the poor Indian girl did not live till our shipgot home. She was taken very sick, and died. We all felt very badwhen she left us. We had taught her a great many things. She couldread a little. She knew all her letters, and could spell out such easywords as there are in your little primers and picture books. She didnot know any thing about God, and Christ, and heaven, before she cameto the ship. But some of us told her about them. She was glad to hearabout them. Oh, how her bright eyes did sparkle when she heard thatChrist came into the world, and died for such little girls as she! Howhappy it made her, to think that He loved her! By and by, she used topray every night, when she went to bed. I taught her to say that sweetlittle prayer which you know so well, and love so well:  Now I lay me down to sleep,  I pray the Lord my soul to keep:  If I should die before I wake,  I pray the Lord my soul to take.Oh, I was very sorry when our little Anna died! We called her Anna.She had another name at home, but we liked Anna better than we didher old name. I was very sorry when she died, and we were all sorry.[Illustration: The Fishermen.]THE LITTLE SAILOR BOY.The story I told you about the Indian girl makes me think of a littleboy that we once had in our ship. He was a very good boy. The captainliked him very much. He was not the captain's child. But the captainused to say that he loved little George as much as if he was his child.The reason the captain loved him, and the reason everybody loved him,was because he was so kind and so good natured, and because he alwaysdid just as he was told to do.I must tell you how George first came to live with us in the ship. Wewere once a great many hundred miles off, and the wind blew veryhard. It blew so hard that we could not sail where we wanted to go,and by and by the ship went upon a bank of sand. There we had to staya good while. We could not get away. Nobody was drowned. We ought tohave been very thankful for that. I hope we were thankful. While wewere lying on the sand bank, the waves dashed against the ship sohard, that we were afraid it would break in pieces. We did not knowwhat to do. Some of us thought we might as well jump into the water,and try to swim to the shore. But the captain said that we shouldcertainly get drowned if we tried to do that.You wonder why we did not get into our boat, and row to the shore. Weshould have done so if we had not lost our boat. But we had no boat.The waves had dashed against it, and tore it away from the place wherewe kept it, so that we could not get it again.But when we thought we must all be lost, we saw a boat coming towardthe ship. Some fishermen had seen us, and were so kind that they cameto us in their boat, so that we could get to the shore. Oh, how gladwe were when we saw them coming! But the waves were so high, that fora good while we thought it would sink before it got to us. The men hadvery hard work to row the boat. The wind blew very hard at one time,and the little boat was blown back again almost to the shore. But theytried again, and after a long time they got to the ship. Then some ofus got into the boat, and the men rowed us to the shore. After that,the boat went back to the ship again, and got the rest of the men.But I have not told the best of the story yet. When we all got intothe house, where it was warm, we told the fishermen that they werevery good to come and help us get away from the ship. We thanked themvery much. And then they told us that we must not thank them; and theypointed to a little boy about as old as you are, I guess. "There,"they said, "that little boy is the one to thank. We should not havegone, if it had not been for him. We were afraid the waves would dashover the boat, and that we should be drowned. We did not dare to go.But this good boy said, 'Do go! oh, do go! The poor men in the shipwill get drowned, if you do not go. I will go if my father will letme. I do not think father's boat will get lost. God will not let usdrown, if we go and try to save the men.'" Well, the boy said so much,that the fishermen told him they would go, and they did go.This little boy's name was George, and this is the one that I told youwe all liked so well. The captain was so pleased with him, that heasked his father to let the little boy come and sail in his ship. Hisfather said he wished his boy to be a sailor, and the boy wanted to bea sailor, too; and that if the captain would be kind to him, littleGeorge might go. So he went, and he was the very best boy I ever sawin my life. He used to talk to the sailors; and when they did wrong,when they said bad words, he would tell them it was naughty, and Godwould not love them if they did so. The sailors did not get angry withhim, because they all saw that little George was good and kind, andthat he wanted to do them good. I know of a good many sailors whostopped swearing, because little George told them, in his kind way,that he could not bear to hear them swear, and that God would not lovethem if they did so.[Illustration][Illustration: Rocks in the Sea.]THE WRECK.The captain of this ship--the same one that loved little George sowell--was drowned not long after that. My little friends, I cannothelp crying when I think that this good captain, who used to be sokind to the sailors, was lost at sea. I was not in the ship at thetime. I was in another ship. I got sick of catching whales, so I didnot want to go in a whale-ship any more.The ship in which this captain was sailing was very near the shore,and there were some high rocks that stood quite down to the edge ofthe water. It was foggy at the time. The captain did not know thatthe ship was so near the rocks, because he could not see through thefog. The wind blew very hard, and blew the ship upon the rocks. Ina minute the ship broke in pieces, and all but two or three of themen who were in it were lost. The captain was lost among the rest.So was little George. When the storm was over, and the wind stoppedblowing, that dear boy was found on the shore, dead. There was a smileon his face, just such a smile as he used to have when he was living.There was a little Bible in his pocket. It was all wet with salt water.But there was some writing on one of the leaves which anybody couldread. It said, "This book was given to little George by his dearmother."[Illustration: The Pyramids and the Sphynx.]THE PYRAMIDS.I once went to a place called Egypt. There I saw a great many strangethings. The pyramids are wonderful enough. Did you ever hear aboutthem? They are made of stone, and are very large. I should think itwould take a great many years to make one of them, if there were ahundred men at work all the time. They must have been built a verylong time. I hardly know how long, but it was a great while beforeChrist was born.I went to the top of the largest pyramid, and went all over it. It wasone of the strangest things I ever saw. Some people think that thepyramids were built to bury kings in, when they died. If they werenot built for that, I am sure I cannot tell what they were built for.There is another odd thing in that country, not far from the pyramids.It is called a _Sphinx_. I know you will say that the name must beas odd as the thing is itself. Well, it _is_ odd, sure enough. TheSphinx is a very large rock, made to look just like a lion with aman's head. It is as large as the house I live in. There is nothingbut the head out of the ground. It was all out of the ground once,when it was first made, but the sand has now covered up that partwhich looks like a lion.A great while ago, people used to call such things as these _gods_.They used to pray to the Sphinx, just as if it was a god--just as ifit could hear anybody pray, the same as God does.[Illustration]THE WHIRLPOOL.You have seen little whirlpools in the brook, I suppose. I once sawa very large one, a great deal larger than any you ever saw in thebrook. It was in the North Sea. This whirlpool does mischiefsometimes. When vessels happen to get on the edge of it, they beginto go round and round, all the time coming near the middle of thewhirlpool. When the captain of the vessel knows that he is in thewhirlpool, he can get his vessel out, if it has just begun to goround. But after it has been in a while, he cannot get out. The vesselkeeps going round and round. The people on board hear the roar of thewhirlpool. It is too late to get away. By and by, the water draws thevessel down. It is dashed to pieces, and all who were in it are lost!I have known little boys and girls get into a whirlpool, too; adifferent kind of a whirlpool, to be sure, but a great deal worse thanthis one in the North Sea. I mean the whirlpool of _sin_. When theyfirst began to be wicked--when they first began to go round in thewhirlpool--they went round very slowly. They could very easily havegot out then, if they had tried, and if they had prayed to God to helpthem. But they did not try. So they kept growing worse and worse. Theywent round swifter and swifter. By and by, they got so far into thewhirlpool that they could not get out. It was too late. They werelost--dashed to pieces on the rocks, in the whirlpool of sin!Little boy! little girl! take care that you do not venture even to theedge of this whirlpool. Give your heart to God, while you are young,and pray to him to keep you from sin, and to lead you to heaven.End of Project Gutenberg's Jack Mason, The Old Sailor, by Theodore Thinker*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JACK MASON, THE OLD SAILOR ******** This file should be named 11105.txt or 11105.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/1/0/11105/Produced by The Internet Archive Children's Library, AndreaBall and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations(1 to 5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for anyparticular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donationmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.

Instruction in this art cannotbe given at a lecture with any profit to my pupils or satisfaction tomyself. One cannot learn by simply seeing a person carve a few times. Asmuch as any other art, it requires study; and success is not attainablewithout much practice. There are certain rules which should bethoroughly understood; if followed faithfully in daily practice, theywill help more than mere observation.This manual is not offered as a guide for special occasions, companydinners, etc., nor for those whose experience renders it unnecessary, orwhose means allow them to employ one skilled in the art. But it isearnestly hoped that the suggestions here offered will aid those whodesire, at their own table in everyday home life, to acquire that easeand perfection of manner which, however suddenly it may be confrontedwith obstacles, will be equal to every occasion.Printed rules for carving are usually accompanied with cuts showing theposition of the joint or fowl on the platter, and having linesindicating the method of cutting. But this will not be attempted in thismanual, as such illustrations seldom prove helpful; for the actual thingbefore us bears faint resemblance to the pictures, which give us onlythe surface, with no hint of what may be inside.It is comparatively a slight matter to carve a solid mass of lean meat.It is the bones, tough gristle, and tendons, that interfere with theeasy progress of the knife. To expect any one to carve well without anyconception of the internal structure of what may be placed before him isas absurd as to expect one to amputate a limb successfully who has noknowledge of human anatomy.Some notion of the relative position of bones, joints, fat, tough andtender muscles, is the first requisite to good carving. All agree thatskill in carving may be acquired by practice; and so it may. Any one candivide a joint if he cut and hack at it long enough, and so learn aftera time just where to make the right cut. But a more satisfactory way isto make a careful study before the material is cooked, and thus learnthe exact position of every joint, bone, and muscle. Become familiarwith a shoulder or a leg of mutton; locate the joints by moving thebones in the joints, or by cutting it into sections, some time when itis to be used for a stew. Or remove the bone in the leg by scraping themeat away at either end. Learn to distinguish the different cuts ofmeat. The best way to learn about carving poultry and game is to cutthem up for a stew or fricassee, provided care be taken not to chopthem, but to disjoint them skilfully.Then, when you attempt to carve, do the best you can every time. Neverallow yourself to be careless about it, even should the only spectatorsbe your wife and children. But do not make your first effort in the artat a company dinner. Every lady should learn the art. There is no reasonwhy she may not excel in it, as she has every opportunity to study thejoint or fowl before cooking. Strength is not required, so much asneatness and care. A firm, steady hand, a cool, collected manner, andconfidence in one's ability will help greatly. Children also should betaught this accomplishment, and should be taught it as soon as they canhandle a knife safely. If parents would allow the children to sharetheir duties at the daily family table, and occasionally when company ispresent, a graceful manner would soon be acquired. When called upon topreside over their own homes there would less frequently be heard theapology, "Father always carved at home, and I have had no practice." Theonly recollection that I now have of a dinner at a friend's some yearsago is the easy and skilful way a young son of my hostess presided atthe head of the table, while the father occupied the place of guest atthe mother's right hand.One must learn first of all to carve neatly, without scattering crumbsor splashing gravy over the cloth or platter; also to cut straight,uniform slices. This may seem an easy matter; but do we often seepressed beef, tongue, or even bread cut as it should be? Be careful todivide the material in such a manner that each person may be servedequally well. Have you never received all flank, or a hard dry wing,while another guest had all tenderloin, or the second joint? After alittle experience you can easily distinguish between the choice portionsand the inferior. Lay each portion on the plate with the browned or bestside up. Keep it compact, not mussy; and serve a good portion of meat,not a bone with hardly any meat on it. After all are served, the portionon the platter should not be left jagged, rough, and sprawling, butshould look inviting enough to tempt one to desire a second portion.Care should be taken to carve in such a way as to get the best effect. Anice joint is often made less inviting from having been cut with thegrain, while meat of rather poor quality is made more tender andpalatable if divided across the grain. Where the whole of the joint isnot required, learn to carve economically, that it may be left in goodshape for another dinner.After you have learned to do the simplest work neatly and gracefully,much painstaking will be necessary in acquiring the power to accomplishwith elegance the more difficult tasks. For to reach the highest degreeof excellence in the art, one must be able to carve the most difficultjoint with perfect skill and ease.But after all this study and a great amount of practice failure oftenhappens, and blame is laid upon the carver which really belongs to someother person,--the butcher, the cook, the table-girl, or the guest. Notall men who sell meat know or practice the best way of cutting up meat.Much may be done by the butcher and by the cook to facilitate the workof the carver. These helps will be noticed more particularly under thehead of special dishes.An essential aid to easy carving, and one often overlooked, is that theplatter be large enough to hold not merely the joint or fowl whilewhole, but also the several portions as they are detached.The joint should be placed in the middle of the platter, in the positionindicated under special directions. There should be sufficient space oneither side for the portions of meat as they are carved; that is, spaceon the bottom, none of the slices being allowed to hang over the edge ofthe dish. If necessary, provide an extra dish. The persistency withwhich some housekeepers cling to a small dish for fear the meat willlook lost on a larger one often makes successful carving impossible.The platter should be placed near the carver, that he may easily reachany part of the joint.The cook should see that all skewers, strings, etc., be removed beforesending the meat or fish to the table. It is extremely awkward to findone's knife impeded by a bit of twine.The carver may stand or sit, as suits his convenience. Anything that isdone easily is generally done gracefully, but when one works at adisadvantage awkwardness is always the result.A very important matter is the condition of the knife. It should have ahandle easy to grasp, a long, thin, sharp, pointed blade, and be of asize adapted to the article to be carved and to the person using it. Alady or a child will prefer a small knife. Be as particular to have theknife sharp as to have it bright and clean; and always sharpen it beforeannouncing the dinner.
