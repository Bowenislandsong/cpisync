mparative isolation. Indeed, at this period, Margaret was in spiritand in thought preeminently a Transcendentalist.[Footnote A: This was a transitional arrangement only.]IX.CREDO.       *       *       *       *       *In regard to Transcendentalism again, there was reason to rejoicein having found a friend, so firm to keep her own ground, while soliberal to comprehend another's stand-point, as was Margaret. Sheknew, not only theoretically, but practically, how endless are thediversities of human character and of Divine discipline, and shereverenced fellow-spirits too sincerely ever to wish to warp them toher will, or to repress their normal development. She was stern butin one claim, that each should be faithful to apparent leadings of theTruth; and could avow widest differences of conviction without feelingthat love was thereby chilled, or the hand withheld from cordialaid. Especially did she render service by enabling one,--through herblended insight, candor, and clearness of understanding,--to see inbright reflection his own mental state.It would be doing injustice to a person like Margaret, always moreenthusiastic than philosophical, to attribute to her anything like asystem of theology; for, hopeful, reverent, aspiring, and free fromscepticism, she felt too profoundly the vastness of the universe andof destiny ever to presume that with her span rule she could measurethe Infinite. Yet the tendency of her thoughts can readily be tracedin the following passages from note-books and letters:--    'When others say to me, and not without apparent ground, that    "the Outward Church is a folly which keeps men from enjoying    the communion of the Church Invisible, and that in the desire    to be helped by, and to help others, men lose sight of the    only sufficient help, which they might find by faithful    solitary intentness of spirit," I answer it is true, and the    present deadness and emptiness summon us to turn our thoughts    in that direction. Being now without any positive form of    religion, any unattractive symbols, or mysterious rites, we    are in the less danger of stopping at surfaces, of accepting    a mediator instead of the Father, a sacrament instead of the    Holy Ghost. And when I see how little there is to impede    and bewilder us, I cannot but accept,--should it be for many    years,--the forlornness, the want of fit expression, the    darkness as to what is to be expressed, even that characterize    our time.    'But I do not, therefore, as some of our friends do, believe    that it will always be so, and that the church is tottering to    its grave, never to rise again. The church was the growth of    human nature, and it is so still. It is but one result of the    impulse which makes two friends clasp one another's hands,    look into one another's eyes at sight of beauty, or the    utterance of a feeling of piety. So soon as the Spirit has    mourned and sought, and waited long enough to open new depths,    and has found something to express, there will again be    a Cultus, a Church. The very people, who say that none is    needed, make one at once. They talk with, they write to one    another. They listen to music, they sustain themselves with    the poets; they like that one voice should tell the thoughts    of several minds, one gesture proclaim that the same life is    at the same moment in many breasts.    'I am myself most happy in my lonely Sundays, and do not feel    the need of any social worship, as I have not for several    years, which I have passed in the same way. Sunday is to me    priceless as a day of peace and solitary reflection. To all    who will, it may be true, that, as Herbert says:--      "Sundays the pillars are      On which Heaven's palace arched lies;      The other days fill up the space      And hollow room with vanities;"    and yet in no wise "vanities," when filtered by the Sunday    crucible. After much troubling of the waters of my life, a    radiant thought of the meaning and beauty of earthly existence    will descend like a healing angel. The stillness permits me    to hear a pure tone from the One in All. But often I am not    alone. The many now, whose hearts, panting for truth and    love, have been made known to me, whose lives flow in the same    direction as mine, and are enlightened by the same star, are    with me. I am in church, the church invisible, undefiled by    inadequate expression. Our communion is perfect; it is that    of a common aspiration; and where two or three are gathered    together in one region, whether in the flesh or the spirit,    He will grant their request. Other communion would be a    happiness,--to break together the bread of mutual thought, to    drink the wine of loving life,--but it is not necessary.    'Yet I cannot but feel that the crowd of men whose pursuits    are not intellectual, who are not brought by their daily walk    into converse with sages and poets, who win their bread from    an earth whose mysteries are not open to them, whose worldly    intercourse is more likely to stifle than to encourage the    sparks of love and faith in their breasts, need on that    day quickening more than repose. The church is now rather a    lecture-room than a place of worship; it should be a school    for mutual instruction. I must rejoice when any one, who lays    spiritual things to heart, feels the call rather to mingle    with men, than to retire and seek by himself.    'You speak of men going up to worship by "households," &c.    Were the actual family the intellectual family, this might be;    but as social life now is, how can it? Do we not constantly    see the child, born in the flesh to one father, choose in the    spirit another? No doubt this is wrong, since the sign does    not stand for the thing signified, but it is one feature of    the time. How will it end? Can families worship together till    it does end?       *       *       *       *       *    'I have let myself be cheated out of my Sunday, by going to    hear Mr. ----. As he began by reading the first chapter    of Isaiah, and the fourth of John's Epistle, I made mental    comments with pure delight. "Bring no more vain oblations."    "Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." "We    know that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because he hath    given us of the Spirit." Then pealed the organ, full of    solemn assurance. But straightway uprose the preacher to deny    mysteries, to deny the second birth, to deny influx, and to    renounce the sovereign gift of insight, for the sake of what    he deemed a "_rational_" exercise of will. As he spoke I could    not choose but deny him all through, and could scarce refrain    from rising to expound, in the light of my own faith, the    words of those wiser Jews which had been read. Was it not a    sin to exchange friendly greeting as we parted, and yet tell    him no word of what was in my mind?    'Still I saw why he looked at things as he did. The old    religionists did talk about "grace, conversion," and the like,    technically, without striving to enter into the idea, till    they quite lost sight of it. Undervaluing the intellect, they    became slaves of a sect, instead of organs of the Spirit. This    Unitarianism has had its place. There was a time for asserting    "the dignity of human nature," and for explaining total    depravity into temporary inadequacy,--a time to say that the    truths of _essence_, if simplified at all in statement from    their infinite variety of existence, should be spoken of as    One, rather than Three, though that number, if they would only    let it reproduce itself simply, is of highest significance.    Yet the time seems now to have come for reinterpreting the old    dogmas. For one I would now preach the Holy Ghost as zealously    as they have been preaching Man, and faith instead of the    understanding, and mysticism instead &c. But why go on? It    certainly is by no means useless to preach. In my experience    of the divine gifts of solitude, I had forgotten what might    be done in this other way. That crowd of upturned faces,    with their look of unintelligent complacency! Give tears and    groans, rather, if there be a mixture of physical excitement    and bigotry. Mr. ---- is heard because, though he has not    entered into the secret of piety, he wishes to be heard,    and with a good purpose,--can make a forcible statement, and    kindle himself with his own thoughts. How many persons must    there be who cannot worship alone, since they are content with    so little! Can none wake the spark that will melt them, till    they take beautiful forms? Were one to come now, who could    purge us with fire, how would these masses glow and be    clarified!    'Mr. ---- made a good suggestion:--"Such things could not be    said in the open air." Let men preach for the open air, and    speak now thunder and lightning, now dew and rustling leaves.    Yet must the preacher have the thought of his day before he    can be its voice. None have it yet; but some of our friends,    perhaps, are nearer than the religious world at large, because    neither ready to dogmatize, as if they had got it, nor content    to stop short with mere impressions and presumptuous hopes. I    feel that a great truth is coming. Sometimes it seems as if    we should have it among us in a day. Many steps of the Temple    have been ascended, steps of purest alabaster, and of shining    jasper, also of rough-brick, and slippery moss-grown stone. We    shall reach what we long for, since we trust and do not fear,    for our God knows not fear, only reverence, and his plan is    All in All.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Who can expect to utter an absolutely pure and clear tone on    these high subjects? Our earthly atmosphere is too gross to    permit it. Yet, a severe statement has rather an undue charm    for me, as I have a nature of great emotion, which loves free    abandonment. I am ready to welcome a descending Moses, come    to turn all men from idolatries. For my priests have been very    generally of the Pagan greatness, revering nature and seeking    excellence, but in the path of progress, not of renunciation.    The lyric inspirations of the poet come very differently on    the ear from the "still, small voice." They are, in fact, all    one revelation; but one must be at the centre to interpret it.    To that centre I have again and again been drawn, but my large    natural life has been, as yet, but partially transfused with    spiritual consciousness. I shun a premature narrowness, and    bide my time. But I am drawn to look at natures who take a    different way, because they seem to complete my being for me.    They, too, tolerate me in my many phases for the same reason,    probably. It pleased me to see, in one of the figures by which    the Gnostics illustrated the progress of man, that Severity    corresponded to Magnificence.'       *       *       *       *       *    'In my quiet retreat, I read Xenophon, and became more    acquainted with his Socrates. I had before known only    the Socrates of Plato, one much more to my mind. Socrates    conformed to the Greek Church, and it is evident with a    sincere reverence, because it was the growth of the _national_    mind. He thought best to stand on its platform, and to    illustrate, though with keen truth, by received forms. This    was his right way, as his influence was naturally private, for    individuals who could in some degree respond to the teachings    of his daemon; he knew the multitude would not understand him.    But it was the other way that Jesus took, preaching in the    fields, and plucking ears of corn on the Sabbath.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Is it my defect of spiritual experience, that while that    weight of sagacity, which is the iron to the dart of genius,    is needful to satisfy me, the undertone of another and a    deeper knowledge does not please, does not command me? Even in    Handel's Messiah, I am half incredulous, half impatient,    when the sadness of the second part comes to check, before    it interprets, the promise of the first; and the strain, "Was    ever sorrow like to his sorrow," is not for me, as I have    been, as I am. Yet Handel was worthy to speak of Christ. The    great chorus, "Since by man came death, by man came also the    resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in    Christ shall all be made alive," if understood in the    large sense of every man his own Saviour, and Jesus only    representative of the way all must walk to accomplish our    destiny, is indeed a worthy gospel.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Ever since ---- told me how his feelings had changed towards    Jesus, I have wished much to write some sort of a Credo, out    of my present state, but have had no time till last night. I    have not satisfied myself in the least, and have written    very hastily, yet, though not full enough to be true, this    statement is nowhere false to me.    * * * 'Whatever has been permitted by the law of being, must    be for good, and only in time not good. We trust, and are led    forward by experience. Light gives experience of outward life,    faith of inward life, and then we discern, however faintly,    the necessary harmony of the two. The moment we have broken    through an obstruction, not accidentally, but by the aid of    faith, we begin to interpret the Universe, and to apprehend    why evil is permitted. Evil is obstruction; Good is    accomplishment.    'It would seem that the Divine Being designs through man    to express distinctly what the other forms of nature only    intimate, and that wherever man remains imbedded in nature,    whether from sensuality, or because he is not yet awakened to    consciousness, the purpose of the whole remains unfulfilled.    Hence our displeasure when Man is not in a sense above    Nature. Yet, when he is not so closely bound with all other    manifestations, as duly to express their Spirit, we are also    displeased. He must be at once the highest form of Nature, and    conscious of the meaning she has been striving successively to    unfold through those below him. Centuries pass; whole races    of men are expended in the effort to produce one that shall    realize this Ideal, and publish Spirit in the human form. Here    and there is a degree of success. Life enough is lived through    a man, to justify the great difficulties attendant on the    existence of mankind. And then throughout all realms of    thought vibrates the affirmation, "This is my beloved Son, in    whom I am well pleased."    'I do not mean to lay an undue stress upon the position and    office of man merely because I am of his race, and understand    best the scope of his destiny. The history of the earth, the    motions of the heavenly bodies, suggest already modes of being    higher than ours, and which fulfil more deeply the office of    interpretation. But I do suppose man's life to be the rivet in    one series of the great chain, and that all higher existences    are analogous to his. Music suggests their mode of being, and,    when carried up on its strong wings, we foresee how the    next step in the soul's ascension shall interpret man to the    universe, as he now interprets those forms beneath himself. * *    'The law of Spirit is identical, whether displaying itself as    genius, or as piety, but its modes of expression are distinct    dialects. All souls desire to become the fathers of souls, as    citizens, legislators, poets, artists, sages, saints; and,    so far as they are true to the law of their incorruptible    essence, they are all Anointed, all Emanuel, all Messiah; but    they are all brutes and devils so far as subjected to the law    of corruptible existence.    'As wherever there is a tendency a form is gradually evolved,    as its Type,--so is it the law of each class and order of    human thoughts to produce a form which shall be the visible    representation of its aim and strivings, and stand before it    as its King. This effort to produce a kingly type it was, that    clothed itself with power as Brahma or Osiris, that gave laws    as Confucius or Moses, that embodied music and eloquence in    the Apollo. This it was that incarnated itself, at one time as    Plato, at another as Michel Angelo, at another as Luther, &c.    Ever seeking, it has produced Ideal after Ideal of the beauty,    into which mankind is capable of being developed; and one    of the highest, in some respects the very highest, of these    kingly types, was the life of Jesus of Nazareth.    'Few believe more in his history than myself, and it is very    dear to me. I believe, in my own way, in the long preparation    of ages for his coming, and the truth of prophecy that    announced him. I see a necessity, in the character of Jesus,    why Abraham should have been the founder of his nation, Moses    its lawgiver, and David its king and poet. I believe in the    genesis of the patriarchs, as given in the Old Testament. I    believe in the prophets,--that they foreknew not only what    their nation longed for, but what the development of universal    Man requires,--a Redeemer, an Atoner, a Lamb of God, taking    away the sins of the world. I believe that Jesus came when the    time was ripe, and that he was peculiarly a messenger and Son    of God. I have nothing to say in denial of the story of his    birth; whatever the actual circumstances were, he was born of    a Virgin, and the tale expresses a truth of the soul. I have    no objection to the miracles, except where they do not    happen to please one's feelings. Why should not a spirit,    so consecrate and intent, develop new laws, and make matter    plastic? I can imagine him walking the waves, without any    violation of my usual habits of thought. He could not remain    in the tomb, they say; certainly not,--death is impossible to    such a being. He remained upon earth; most true, and all who    have met him since on the way, have felt their hearts burn    within them. He ascended to heaven; surely, how could it be    otherwise?    'Would I could express with some depth what I feel as to    religion in my very soul; it would be a clear note of calm    assurance. But for the present this must suffice with regard    to Christ. I am grateful here, as everywhere, when Spirit    bears fruit in fulness; it attests the justice of aspiration,    it kindles faith, it rebukes sloth, it enlightens resolve.    But so does a beautiful infant. Christ's life is only one    modification of the universal harmony. I will not loathe    sects, persuasions, systems, though I cannot abide in them one    moment, for I see that by most men they are still needed. To    them their banners, their tents; let them be Fire-worshippers,    Platonists, Christians; let them live in the shadow of past    revelations. But, oh, Father of our souls, the One, let me    seek Thee! I would seek Thee in these forms, and in proportion    as they reveal Thee, they teach me to go beyond themselves.    I would learn from them all, looking only to Thee! But let me    set no limits from the past, to my own soul, or to any soul.    'Ages may not produce one worthy to loose the shoes of    the Prophet of Nazareth; yet there will surely be another    manifestation of that Word which was in the beginning. And all    future manifestations will come, like Christianity, "not to    destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfil." The very    greatness of this manifestation demands a greater. As an    Abraham called for a Moses, and a Moses for a David, so does    Christ for another Ideal. We want a life more complete and    various than that of Christ. We have had a Messiah to teach    and reconcile; let us now have a Man to live out all the    symbolical forms of human life, with the calm beauty of a    Greek God, with the deep consciousness of a Moses, with the    holy love and purity of Jesus.'X.SELF-SOVEREIGNTY.       *       *       *       *       *To one studying the signs of the times, it was quite instructive towatch the moods of a mind so sensitive as Margaret's; for her delicatemeter indicated in advance each coming change in the air-currents ofthought. But I was chiefly interested in the processes whereby she wasgaining harmony and unity. The more one studied her, the more plainlyhe saw that her peculiar power was the result of fresh, fervent,exhaustless, and indomitable affections. The emotive force in her,indeed, was immense in volume, and most various in tendency; and itwas wonderful to observe the outward equability of one inwardly soimpassioned.This was, in fact, the first problem to be solved in gainingreal knowledge of her commanding character: "How did a person,by constitution so impetuous, become so habitually serene?"In temperament Margaret seemed a Bacchante,[A] prompt for wildexcitement, and fearless to tread by night the mountain forest, withsong and dance of delirious mirth; yet constantly she wore the laurelin token of purification, and, with water from fresh fountains,cleansed the statue of Minerva. Stagnancy and torpor were intolerableto her free and elastic impulses; a brilliant fancy threw over eachplace and incident Arcadian splendor; and eager desire, with energeticpurposes, filled her with the consciousness of large latent life:and yet the lower instincts were duly subordinated to the higher, anddignified self-control ordered her deportment. Somehow, according tothe doctrine of the wise Jacob Boehme, the fierce, hungry fire hadmet in embrace the meek, cool water, and was bringing to birththe pleasant light-flame of love. The transformation, though notperfected, was fairly begun.Partly I could see how this change had been wrought. Ill health, pain,disappointment, care, had tamed her spirits. A wide range throughthe romantic literature of ancient and modern times had exaltedwhile expending her passions. In the world of imagination, she haddischarged the stormful energy which would have been destructive inactual life. And in thought she had bound herself to the mast whilesailing past the Sirens. Through sympathy, also, from childhood, withthe tragi-comedy of many lives around her, she had gained experienceof the laws and limitations of providential order. Gradually, too, shehad risen to higher planes of hope, whence opened wider prospects ofdestiny and duty. More than all, by that attraction of oppositeswhich a strong will is most apt to feel, she had sought, as chosencompanions, persons of scrupulous reserve, of modest coolness,and severe elevation of view. Finally, she had been taught, by adiscipline specially fitted to her dispositions, to trust the leadingsof the Divine Spirit. The result was, that at this period Margaret hadbecome a Mystic. Her prisoned emotions found the freedom they pinedfor in contemplation of nature's exquisite harmonies,--in poeticregards of the glory that enspheres human existence, when seen as awhole from beyond the clouds,--and above all in exultant consciousnessof life ever influent from the All-Living.A few passages from, her papers will best illustrate this proneness torapture.    'My tendency is, I presume, rather to a great natural than    to a deep religious life. But though others may be more    conscientious and delicate, few have so steady a faith in    Divine Love. I may be arrogant and impetuous, but I am never    harsh and morbid. May there not be a mediation, rather than a    conflict, between piety and genius? Greek and Jew, Italian and    Saxon, are surely but leaves on one stern, at last.'       *       *       *       *       *    'I am in danger of giving myself up to experiences till    they so steep me in ideal passion that the desired goal is    forgotten in the rich present. Yet I think I am learning how    to use life more wisely.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Forgive me, beautiful ones, who earlier learned the harmony    of your beings,--with whom eye, voice, and hand are already    true to the soul! Forgive me still some "lispings and    stammerings of the passionate age." Teach me,--me, also,--to    utter my paean in its full sweetness. These long lines are    radii from one centre; aid me to fill the circumference. Then    each moment, each act, shall be true. The pupil has found the    carbuncle,[B] but knows not yet how to use it day by day. But    "though his companions wondered at the pupil, the master loved    him." He loves me, my friends. Do ye trust me. Wash the tears    and black stains from the records of my life by the benignity    of a true glance; make each discord harmony, by striking    again the key-note; forget the imperfect interviews, burn the    imperfect letters, till at last the full song bursts forth,    the key-stone is given from heaven to the arch, the past is    all pardoned and atoned for, and we live forever in the Now.'    * *       *       *       *       *       *    'Henceforth I hope I shall not write letters thus full of    childish feeling; for in feeling I am indeed a child, and the    least of children. Soon I must return into the Intellect, for    _there_ in sight, at least, I am a man, and could write the    words very calmly and in steadfast flow. But, lately, the    intellect has been so subordinated to the soul, that I am    not free to enter the Basilikon, and plead and hear till I am    called. But let me not stay too long in this Sicilian valley,    gathering my flowers, for "night cometh."'       *       *       *       *       *    'The other evening, while hearing the Creation, in the music    of "There shoots the healing plant," I felt what I would ever    feel for suffering souls.

Yes; even so would I ever see man. I will wait, and never    despair, through all the dull years.'       *       *       *       *       *    'I am "too fiery." Even so.

What    majesty! what depth! what tearful sweetness! what victory!    This was truly a fire upon an altar. There are a succession    of soaring passages, near the end of the third movement, which    touch me most deeply. Though soaring, they hold on with a    stress which almost breaks the chains of matter to the hearer.    O, how refreshing, after polemics and philosophy, to soar thus    on strong wings! Yes, Father, I will wander in dark ways with    the crowd, since thou seest best for me to be tied down.    But only in thy free ether do I know myself. When I read    Beethoven's life, I said, "I will never repine." When I heard    this symphony, I said, "I will triumph."       *       *       *       *       *    'To-day I have finished the life of Raphael, by Quatremere de    Quincy, which has so long engaged me.

If noble    growths are always slow, others may ripen far worthier fruit    than is permitted to my tropical heats and tornadoes. Let me    clasp the cross on my breast, as I have done a thousand times    before.'      'Let me but gather from the earth one full-grown fragrant flower;      Within my bosom let it bloom through, its one blooming hour;      Within my bosom let it die, and to its latest breath      My own shall answer, "Having lived, I shrink not now from death."      It is this niggard halfness that turns my heart to stone;      'T is the cup seen, not tasted, that makes the infant moan.      For once let me press firm my lips upon the moment's brow,      For once let me distinctly feel I am all happy now,      And bliss shall seal a blessing upon that moment's brow.'    'I was in a state of celestial happiness, which lasted a great    while. For months I was all radiant with faith, and love,    and life. I began to be myself. Night and day were equally    beautiful, and the lowest and highest equally holy. Before, it    had seemed as if the Divine only gleamed upon me; but then it    poured into and through me a tide of light. I have passed down    from the rosy mountain, now; but I do not forget its pure air,    nor how the storms looked as they rolled beneath my feet. I    have received my assurance, and if the shadows should lie upon    me for a century, they could never make me forgetful of the    true hour. Patiently I bide my time.'The last passage describes a peculiar illumination, to which Margaretoften referred as the period when her earthly being culminated, andwhen, in the noon-tide of loving enthusiasm, she felt wholly at onewith God, with Man, and the Universe. It was ever after, to her,an earnest that she was of the Elect. In a letter to one of herconfidential female friends, she thus fondly looks back to thisexperience on the mount of transfiguration:--    'You know how, when the leadings of my life found their    interpretation, I longed to share my joy with those I prized    most; for I felt that if they could but understand the past we    should meet entirely. They received me, some more, some less,    according to the degree of intimacy between our natures. But    now I have done with the past, and again move forward. The    path looks more difficult, but I am better able to bear its    trials. We shall have much communion, even if not in the    deepest places. I feel no need of isolation, but only of    temperance in thought and speech, that the essence may not    evaporate in words, but grow plenteous within. The Life will    give me to my own. I am not yet so worthy to love as some    others are, because my manifold nature is not yet harmonized    enough to be faithful, and I begin, to see how much it was the    want of a pure music in me that has made the good doubt me.    Yet have I been true to the best light I had, and if I am so    now much will be given.    'During my last weeks of solitude I was very happy, and all    that had troubled me became clearer. The angel was not weary    of waiting for Gunhilde, till she had unravelled her mesh of    thought, and seeds of mercy, of purification, were planted    in the breast. Whatever the past has been, I feel that I have    always been reading on and on, and that the Soul of all souls    has been patient in love to mine. New assurances were given    me, that if I would be faithful and humble, there was no    experience that would not tell its heavenly errand. If    shadows have fallen, already they give way to a fairer if more    tempered light; and for the present I am so happy that the    spirit kneels.    'Life, is richly worth living, with its continual revelations    of mighty woe, yet infinite hope: and I take it to my breast.    Amid these scenes of beauty, all that is little, foreign,    unworthy, vanishes like a dream. So shall it be some time    amidst the Everlasting Beauty, when true joy shall begin and    never cease.'Filled thus as Margaret was with ecstasy, she was yet more thanwilling,--even glad,--to bear her share in the universal sorrow. Wellshe knew that pain must be proportioned to the fineness and fervor ofher organization; that the very keenness of her sensibility exposedher to constant disappointment or disgust; that no friend, howeverfaithful, could meet the demands of desires so eager, of sympathiesso absorbing. Contrasted with her radiant visions, how dreary lookedactual existence; how galling was the friction of petty hindrances;how heavy the yoke of drudging care! Even success seemed failure,when measured by her conscious aim; and experience had brought out toconsciousness excesses and defects, which humbled pride while shamingself-confidence. But suffering as she did with all the intensity of sopassionate a nature, Margaret still welcomed the searching discipline.'It is only when Persephone returns from lower earth that she wedsDyonysos, and passes from central sadness into glowing joy,' shewrites. And again: 'I have no belief in beautiful lives; we are bornto be mutilated; and the blood must flow till in every vein its placeis supplied by the Divine ichor.' And she reiterates: 'The method ofProvidence with me is evidently that of "cross-biassing," as Herberthath it. In a word, to her own conscience and to intimate friends sheavowed, without reserve, that there was in her 'much rude matter thatneeded to be spiritualized.' Comment would but weaken the pathos ofthe following passages, in which so plainly appears a once wilfultemper striving, with child-like faith, to obey:--    'I have been a chosen one; the lesson of renunciation was    early, fully taught, and the heart of stone quite broken    through. The Great Spirit wished to leave me no refuge but    itself. Convictions have been given, enough to guide me many    years if I am steadfast. How deeply, how gratefully I feel    this blessing, as the fabric of others' hopes are shivering    round me. Peace will not always flow thus softly in my life;    but, O, our Father! how many hours has He consecrated to    Himself. How often has the Spirit chosen the time, when no ray    came from without, to descend upon the orphan life!'       *       *       *       *       *    'A humbler, tenderer spirit! Yes, I long for it. But how to    gain it? I see no way but prayerfully to bend myself to meet    the hour. Let friends be patient with me, and pardon some    faint-heartedness. The buds will shiver in the cold air when    the sheaths drop. It will not be so long. The word "Patience"    has been spoken; it shall be my talisman. A nobler courage    will be given, with gentleness and humility. My conviction is    clear that all my troubles are needed, and that one who has    had so much light thrown upon the path, has no excuse for    faltering steps.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Could we command enthusiasm; had we an interest with the gods    which would light up those sacred fires at will, we should be    even seraphic in our influences. But life, if not a complete    waste of wearisome hours, must be checkered with them; and I    find that just those very times, when I feel all glowing and    radiant in the happiness of receiving and giving out again the    divine fluid, are preludes to hours of languor, weariness, and    paltry doubt, born of---            "The secret soul's mistrust      To find her fair ethereal wings        Weighed down by vile, degraded dust."    'To this, all who have chosen or been chosen to a life of    thought must submit. Yet I rejoice in my heritage. Should I    venture to complain? Perhaps, if I were to reckon up the hours    of bodily pain, those passed in society with which I could    not coalesce, those of ineffectual endeavor to penetrate the    secrets of nature and of art, or, worse still, to reproduce    the beautiful in some way for myself, I should find they    far outnumbered those of delightful sensation, of full and    soothing thought, of gratified tastes and affections, and of    proud hope. Yet these last, if few, how lovely, how rich in    presage! None, who have known them, can in their worst estate    fail to hope that they may be again upborne to higher, purer    blue.'       *       *       *       *       *    'As I was steeped in the divine tenth book of the Republic,    came ----'s letter, in which he so insultingly retracts his    engagements. I finished the book obstinately, but could get    little good of it; then went to ask comfort of the descending    sun in the woods and fields. What a comment it was on the    disparity between my pursuits and my situation to receive    such a letter while reading that book! However, I will not let    life's mean perplexities blur from my eye the page of Plato;    nor, if natural tears must be dropt, murmur at a lot, which,    with all its bitterness, has given time and opportunity to    cherish an even passionate love for Truth and Beauty.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Black Friday it has been, and my heart is well nigh wearied    out. Shall I never be able to act and live with persons of    views high as my own? or, at least, with some steadiness of    feeling for me to calculate upon? Ah, me! what woes within and    without; what assaults of folly; what mean distresses; and,    oh, what wounds from cherished hands! Were ye the persons who    should stab thus? Had I, too, the Roman right to fold my    robe about me decently, and breathe the last sigh! The last!    Horrible, indeed, should sobs, deep as these, be drawn to all    eternity. But no; life could not hold out for more than one    lease of sorrow. This anguish, however, will be wearied out,    as I know by experience, alas! of how many such hours.'       *       *       *       *       *    'I am reminded to-day of the autumn hours at Jamaica Plain,    where, after arranging everything for others that they wanted    of me, I found myself, at last, alone in my still home, where    everything, for once, reflected my feelings. It was so still,    the air seemed full of spirits. How happy I was! with what    sweet and solemn happiness! All things had tended to a crisis    in me, and I was in a higher state, mentally and spiritually,    than I ever was before or shall be again, till death shall    introduce me to a new sphere. I purposed to spend the winter    in study and self-collection, and to write constantly. I    thought I should thus be induced to embody in beautiful    forms all that lay in my mind, and that life would ripen into    genius. But a very little while these fair hopes bloomed; and,    since I was checked then, I do never expect to blossom forth    on earth, and all postponements come naturally. At that time    it seemed as if angels left me. Yet, now, I think they still    are near. Renunciation appears to be entire, and I quite    content; yet, probably, 't is no such thing, and that work is    to be done over and over again.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Do you believe our prayers avail for one another? and that    happiness is good for the soul? Pray, then, for me, that I may    have a little peace,--some green and flowery spot, 'mid which    my thoughts may rest; yet not upon fallacy, but only upon    something genuine. I am deeply homesick, yet where is that    home? If not on earth, why should we look to heaven? I would    fain truly live wherever I must abide, and bear with full    energy on my lot, whatever it is. He, who alone knoweth,    will affirm that. I have tried to work whole-hearted from an    earnest faith. Yet my hand is often languid, and my heart is    slow. I would be gone; but whither? I know not; if I cannot    make this spot of ground yield the corn and roses, famine must    be my lot forever and ever, surely.'       *       *       *       *       *    'I remember how at a similar time of perplexity, when there    were none to counsel, hardly one to sympathize, and when the    conflicting wishes of so many whom I loved pressed the aching    heart on every side, after months of groping and fruitless    thought, the merest trifle precipitated the whole mass; all    became clear as crystal, and I saw of what use the tedious    preparation had been, by the deep content I felt in the    result.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Beethoven! Tasso! It is well to think of you! What sufferings    from baseness, from coldness! How rare and momentary were the    flashes of joy, of confidence and tenderness, in these noblest    lives! Yet could not their genius be repressed. The Eternal    Justice lives. O, Father, teach the spirit the meaning of    sorrow, and light up the generous fires of love and hope and    faith, without which I cannot live!'       *       *       *       *       *    'What signifies it that Thou dost always give me to drink more    deeply of the inner fountains? And why do I seek a reason for    these repulsions and strange arrangements of my mortal lot,    when I always gain from them a deeper love for all men, and a    deeper trust in Thee? Wonderful are thy ways! But lead me the    darkest and the coldest as Thou wilt.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Please, good Genius of my life, to make me very patient,    resolute, gentle, while no less ardent; and after having tried    me well, please present, at the end of some thousand years    or so, a sphere of congenial and consecutive labors; of    heart-felt, heart-filling wishes carried out into life on    the instant; of aims obviously, inevitably proportioned to my    highest nature. Sometime, in God's good time, let me live as    swift and earnest as a flash of the eye. Meanwhile, let me    gather force slowly, and drift along lazily, like yonder    cloud, and be content to end in a few tears at last.'       *       *       *       *       *    'To-night I lay on the sofa, and saw how the flame shot up    from beneath, through the mass of coal that had been    piled above. It shot up in wild beautiful jets, and then    unexpectedly sank again, and all was black, unsightly and    forlorn. And thus, I thought, is it with my life at present.    Yet if the fire beneath persists and conquers, that black dead    mass will become all radiant, life-giving, fit for the altar    or the domestic hearth. Yes, and it shall be so.'       *       *       *       *       *    'My tendency at present is to the deepest privacy. Where can I    hide till I am given to myself? Yet I love the others more and    more. When they are with me I must give them the best from    my scrip. I see their infirmities, and would fain heal them,    forgetful of my own! But am I left one moment alone, then, a    poor wandering pilgrim, but no saint, I would seek the shrine,    and would therein die to the world. Then if from the poor    relics some miracles might be wrought, that should be for my    fellows. Yet some of the saints were able to work in their    generation, for they had renounced all!'       *       *       *       *       *    'Forget, if you can, all of petulant or overstrained that may    have displeased you in me, and commend me in your prayers to    my best self. When, in the solitude of the spirit, comes upon    you some air from the distance, a breath of aspiration, of    faith, of pure tenderness, then believe that the Power which    has guided me so faithfully, emboldens my thoughts to frame a    prayer for you.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Beneath all pain inflicted by Nature, be not only serene, but    more; let it avail thee in prayer. Put up, at the moment of    greatest suffering, a prayer; not for thy own escape, but    for the enfranchisement of some being dear to thee, and the    Sovereign Spirit will accept thy ransom.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Strive, strive, my soul, to be innocent; yes! beneficent.    Does any man wound thee? not only forgive, but Work into thy    thought intelligence of the kind of pain, that thou mayest    never inflict it on another spirit. Then its work is done; it    will never search thy whole nature again. O, love much, and be    forgiven!'       *       *       *       *       *    'No! we cannot leave society while one clod remains unpervaded    by divine life. We cannot live and grow in consecrated earth,    alone. Let us rather learn to stand up like the Holy Father,    and with extended arms bless the whole world.'       *       *       *       *       *    'It will be happiness indeed, if, on passing this first stage,    we are permitted, in some degree, to alleviate the ills of    those we love,--to lead them on a little way; to aid them when    they call. Often it seems to me, it would be sweet to feel    that I had certainly conferred one benefit. All my poor little    schemes for others are apparently blighted, and now, as ever,    I am referred to the Secular year for the interpretation of my    moments.'In one of Margaret's manuscripts is found this beautifulsymbol:--'There is a species of Cactus, from whose outer bark, iftorn by an ignorant person, there exudes a poisonous liquid; but thenatives, who know the plant, strike to the core, and there find asweet, refreshing juice, that renews their strength.' Surely thepreceding extracts prove that she was learning how to draw life-givingvirtue from the very heart of evil. No superficial experience ofsorrow embittered her with angry despair; but through profoundacceptance, she sought to imbibe, from every ill, peace, purity andgentleness.       *       *       *       *       *The two fiery trials through which she had been made to pass, andthrough which she was yet to pass again and again,--obstruction tothe development of her genius, and loneliness of heart,--were the veryfurnace needed to burn the dross from her gold, till it could fitlyimage the Heavenly Refiner. By inherited traits, and indiscreettreatment, self-love had early become so excessive that only severestdiscipline could transmute it to disinterestedness. Pity for her ownmisfortunes had, indeed, taught her to curb her youthful scornfor mediocrity, and filled her with considerateness and delicatesensibility. Constant experience, too, of the wonderful modes wherebyher fate was shaped by overruling mercy, had chastened her love ofpersonal sway, and her passion for a commanding career; andMargaret could humble herself,--did often humble herself,--with anall-resigning contrition, that was most touching to witness in onenaturally so haughty. Of this the following letter to a valued friendgives illustration:--    'I ought, I know, to have laid aside my own cares and griefs,    been on the alert for intelligence that would gratify you,    and written letters such as would have been of use and given    pleasure to my wise, tender, ever faithful friend. But no; I    first intruded on your happiness with my sorrowful epistles,    and then, because you did not seem to understand my position,    with sullen petulance I resolved to write no more. Nay, worse;    I tried to harden my heart against you, and felt, "If you    cannot be all, you shall be nothing."    'It was a bad omen that I lost the locket you gave me, which    I had constantly worn. Had that been daily before my eyes,    to remind me of all your worth,--of the generosity with which    you, a ripe and wise character, received me to the privileges    of equal friendship; of the sincerity with which you reproved    and the love with which you pardoned my faults; of how much    you taught me, and bore with from me,--it would have softened    the flint of my heart, and I should have relaxed from my    isolation.    'How shall I apologize for feelings which I now recognize as    having been so cold, so bitter and unjust? I can only say    I have suffered greatly, till the tone of my spirits seems    destroyed. Since I have been at leisure to realize how very    ill I have been, under what constant pain and many annoyances    I have kept myself upright, and how, if I have not done    my work, I have learned my lesson to the end, I should be    inclined to excuse myself for every fault, except this neglect    and ingratitude against friends. Yet, if you can forgive, I    will try to forgive myself, and I do think I shall never so    deeply sin again.'Yet, though thus frank to own to herself and to her peers her errors,Margaret cherished a trust in her powers, a confidence in her destiny,and an ideal of her being, place and influence, so lofty as to beextravagant. In the morning-hour and mountain-air of aspiration, hershadow moved before her, of gigantic size, upon the snow-white vapor.In accordance with her earnest charge, 'Be true as Truth to me,' Icould not but expose this propensity to self-delusion; and her answeris her best explanation and defence:--    'I protest against your applying to me, even in your    most transient thought, such an epithet as "determined    exaggeration." Exaggeration, if you will; but not determined.    No; I would have all open to the light, and would let my    boughs be pruned, when they grow rank and unfruitful, even if    I felt the knife to the quick of my being. Very fain would I    have a rational modesty, without self-distrust; and may    the knowledge of my failures leaven my soul, and check its    intemperance. If you saw me wholly, you would not, I think,    feel as you do; for you would recognize the force, that    regulates my life and tempers the ardor with an eventual    calmness. You would see, too, that the more I take my flight    in poetical enthusiasm, the stronger materials I bring back    for my nest. Certainly I am nowise yet an angel; but neither    am I an utterly weak woman, and far less a cold intellect.    God is rarely afar off. Exquisite nature is all around. Life    affords vicissitudes enough to try the energies of the human    will. I can pray, I can act, I can learn, I can constantly    immerse myself in the Divine Beauty. But I also need to    love my fellow-men, and to meet the responsive glance of my    spiritual kindred.'Again, she says:--    'I like to hear you express your sense of my defects. The    word "arrogance" does not, indeed, appear to me to be just;    probably because I do not understand what you mean. But in due    time I doubtless shall; for so repeatedly have you used it,    that it must stand for something real in my large and rich,    yet irregular and unclarified nature. But though I like to    hear you, as I say, and think somehow your reproof does me    good, by myself, I return to my native bias, and feel as if    there was plenty of room in the universe for my faults, and    as if I could not spend time in thinking of them, when so    many things interest me more. I have no defiance or coldness,    however, as to these spiritual facts which I do not know;    but I must follow my own law, and bide my time, even if, like    Oedipus, I should return a criminal, blind and outcast, to    ask aid from the gods. Such possibilities, I confess, give    me great awe; for I have more sense than most, of the tragic    depths that may open suddenly in the life. Yet, believing in    God, anguish cannot be despair, nor guilt perdition. I feel    sure that I have never wilfully chosen, and that my life has    been docile to such truth as was shown it. In an environment    like mine, what may have seemed too lofty or ambitious in    my character was absolutely needed to keep the heart from    breaking and enthusiasm from extinction.'Such Egoism as this, though lacking the angel grace ofunconsciousness, has a stoical grandeur that commands respect. Indeed,in all that Margaret spoke, wrote, or did, no cynic could detect thetaint of meanness. Her elation came not from opium fumes of vanity,inhaled in close chambers of conceit, but from the stimulus ofsunshine, fresh breezes, and swift movement upon the winged steed ofpoesy. Her existence was bright with romantic interest to herself.There was an amplitude and elevation in her aim, which were worthy, asshe felt, of human honor and of heavenly aid; and she was buoyed upby a courageous good-will, amidst all evils, that she knew would havebeen recognized as heroic in the chivalric times, when "every morningbrought a noble chance." Neither was her self-regard of an engrossingtemper. On the contrary, the sense of personal dignity taught herthe worth of the lowliest human being, and her intense desire forharmonious conditions quickened a boundless compassion for thesqualid, downcast, and drudging multitude. She aspired to live inmajestic fulness of benignant and joyful activity, leaving a track oflight with every footstep; and, like the radiant Iduna, bearing toman the golden apples of immortality, she would have made each meetingwith her fellows rich with some boon that should never fade, butbrighten in bloom forever.This characteristic self-esteem determined the quality of Margaret'sinfluence, which was singularly penetrating, and most beneficent wheremost deeply and continuously felt. Chance acquaintance with her, likea breath from the tropics, might have prematurely burst the buds offeeling in sensitive hearts, leaving after blight and barrenness.Natures, small in compass and of fragile substance, might have beendistorted and shattered by attempts to mould themselves on her grandmodel. And in her seeming unchartered impulses,--whose latent law washonorable integrity,--eccentric spirits might have found encouragementfor capricious license. Her morbid subjectivity, too, might, bycontagion, have affected others with undue self-consciousness.And, finally, even intimate friends might have been tempted, byher flattering love, to exaggerate their own importance, until theyrecognized that her regard for them was but one niche in a Pantheonat whose every shrine she offered incense. But these ill effects weresuperficial accidents. The peculiarity of her power was to make allwho were in concert with her feel the miracle of existence. She livedherself with such concentrated force in the moments, that she wasalways effulgent with thought and affection,--with conscience,courage, resource, decision, a penetrating and forecasting wisdom.Hence, to associates, her presence seemed to touch even common scenesand drudging cares with splendor, as when, through the scud ofa rain-storm, sunbeams break from serene blue openings, crowningfamiliar things with sudden glory. By manifold sympathies, yet centralunity, she seemed in herself to be a goodly company, and her wordsand deeds imparted the virtue of a collective life. So tender was heraffection, that, like a guardian genius, she made her friends' soulsher own, and identified herself with their fortunes; and yet, so pureand high withal was her justice, that, in her recognition of theirpast success and present claims, there came a summons for freshendeavor after the perfect. The very thought of her roused manlinessto emulate the vigorous freedom, with which one was assured, thatwherever placed she was that instant acting; and the mere mentionof her name was an inspiration of magnanimity, and faithfulness, andtruth.  '"Sincere has been their striving; great their love,"'is a sufficient apology for any life,' wrote Margaret; and howpreeminently were these words descriptive of herself. Hers was indeed  "The equal temper of heroic hearts,  Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will,  To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."This indomitable aspiration found utterance in the following verses,on  'SUB ROSA CRUX.  'In times of old, as we are told,      When men more childlike at the feet    Of Jesus sat than now,  A chivalry was known, more bold  Than ours, and yet of stricter vow,      And worship more complete.  'Knights of the Rosy Cross! they bore  Its weight within the breast, but wore    Without the sign, in glistening ruby bright.  The gall and vinegar they drank alone,  But to the world at large would only own    The wine of faith, sparkling with rosy light.  'They knew the secret of the sacred oil,    Which, poured upon the prophet's head,      Could keep him wise and pure for aye,  Apart from all that might distract or soil;    With this their lamps they fed,  Which burn in their sepulchral shrines,      Unfading night and day.    'The pass-word now is lost  To that initiation full and free;    Daily we pay the cost  Of our slow schooling for divine degree.    We know no means to feed an undying lamp,    Our lights go out in every wind and damp.    'We wear the cross of Ebony and Gold,  Upon a dark back-ground a form of light,    A heavenly hope within a bosom cold,  A starry promise in a frequent night;    And oft the dying lamp must trim again,    For we are conscious, thoughtful, striving men.  'Yet be we faithful to this present trust,  Clasp to a heart resigned this faithful Must;      Though deepest dark our efforts should enfold,      Unwearied mine to find the vein of gold;  Forget not oft to waft the prayer on high;--  The rosy dawn again shall fill the sky.  'And by that lovely light all truth revealed,--  The cherished forms, which sad distrust concealed,      Transfigured, yet the same, will round us stand,      The kindred angels of a faithful band;  Ruby and ebon cross then cast aside,  No lamp more needed, for the night has died.  '"Be to the best thou knowest ever true,"    Is all the creed.  Then be thy talisman of rosy hue,    Or fenced with thorns, that wearing, thou must bleed,  Or, gentle pledge of love's prophetic view,    The faithful steps it will securely lead.  'Happy are all who reach that distant shore,    And bathe in heavenly day;  Happiest are those who high the banner bore,    To marshal others on the way,  Or waited for them, fainting and way-worn,    By burthens overborne.'[Footnote A: This sentence was written before I was aware thatMargaret, as will be seen hereafter, had used the same symbol todescribe Madame Sand. The first impulse, of course, when I discoveredthis coincidence, was to strike out the above passage; yet, on secondthought, I have retained it, as indicating an actual resemblancebetween these two grand women. In Margaret, however, the benedictionof their noble-hearted sister, Elizabeth Barrett, had already beenfulfilled; for she to "woman's claim" had ever joined"the angel-graceOf a pure genius sanctified from blame."][Footnote B: Novalis.]NEW YORK.JOURNALS, LETTERS, &c.       *       *       *       *       *  "How much, preventing God, how much.

But I have never stopped yet    in fulfilling what I have undertaken, and hope I shall not be    compelled to now. How farcical seems the preparation needed to    gain a few moments' life; yet just so the plant works all the    year round for a few days' flower.'But in brighter mood she says, again:--    'I congratulate myself that I persisted, against every    persuasion, in doing all I could last winter; for now I am and    shall be free from debt, and I look on the position of debtor    with a dread worthy of some respectable Dutch burgomaster.    My little plans for others, too, have succeeded; our small    household is well arranged, and all goes smoothly as a    wheel turns round. Mother, moreover, has learned not to    be over-anxious when I suffer, so that I am not obliged to    suppress my feelings when it is best to yield to them. Thus,    having more calmness, I feel often that a sweet serenity is    breathed through every trifling duty. I am truly grateful for    being enabled to fulfil obligations which to some might seem    humble, but which to me are sacred.'And in mid-summer comes this pleasant picture:--    'Every day, I rose and attended to the many little calls which    are always on me, and which have been more of late. Then,    about eleven, I would sit down to write, at my window, close    to which is the apple-tree, lately full of blossoms, and now    of yellow birds. Opposite me was Del Sarto's Madonna; behind    me Silenus, holding in his arms the infant Pan. I felt very    content with my pen, my daily bouquet, and my yellow birds.    About five I would go out and walk till dark; then would    arrive my proofs, like crabbed old guardians, coming to tea    every night. So passed each day. The 23d of May, my birth-day,    about one o'clock, I wrote the last line of my little book;[A]    then I went to Mount Auburn, and walked gently among the    graves.'As the brothers had now left college, and had entered or were enteringupon professional and commercial life, while the sister was married,and the mother felt calls to visit in turn her scattered children, itwas determined to break up the "Home." 'As a family,' Margaret writes,    'we are henceforth to be parted. But though for months I had    been preparing for this separation, the last moments were very    sad. Such tears are childish tears, I know, and belie a deeper    wisdom. It is foolish in me to be so anxious about my family.    As I went along, it seemed as if all I did was for God's sake;    but if it had been, could I now thus fear? My relations to    them are altogether fair, so far as they go. As to their being    no more to me than others of my kind, there is surely a mystic    thrill betwixt children of one mother, which can never cease    to be felt till the soul is quite born anew. The earthly    family is the scaffold whereby we build the spiritual one. The    glimpses we here obtain of what such relations should be are    to me an earnest that the family is of Divine Order, and not a    mere school of preparation. And in the state of perfect being    which we call Heaven, I am assured that family ties will    attain to that glorified beauty of harmonious adaptation,    which stellar groups in the pure blue typify.'Margaret's admirable fidelity, as daughter and sister,--amidst herincessant literary pursuits, and her far-reaching friendships,--can bejustly appreciated by those only who were in her confidence; but fromthe following slight sketches generous hearts can readily infer whatwas the quality of her home-affections.    'Mother writes from Canton that my dear old grandmother is    dead. I regret that you never saw her. She was a picture of    primitive piety, as she sat holding the "Saint's Rest" in her    hand, with her bowed, trembling figure, and her emphatic nods,    and her sweet blue eyes. They were bright to the last, though    she was ninety. It is a great loss to mother, who felt a large    place warmed in her heart by the fond and grateful love of    this aged parent.'    'We cannot be sufficiently grateful for our mother,--so so    fair a blossom of the white amaranth; truly to us a mother    in this, that we can venerate her piety. Our relations to her    have known no jar. Nothing vulgar has sullied them; and in    this respect life has been truly domesticated. Indeed, when I    compare my lot with others, it seems to have had a more than    usual likeness to home; for relations have been as noble    as sincerity could make them, and there has been a frequent    breath of refined affection, with its sweet courtesies. Mother    thanks God in her prayers for "all the acts of mutual love    which have been permitted;" and looking back, I see that these    have really been many. I do not recognize this, as the days    pass, for to my desires life would be such a flower-chain of    symbols, that what is done seems very scanty, and the thread    shows too much.    'She has just brought me a little bouquet. Her flowers have    suffered greatly by my neglect, when I would be engrossed    by other things in her absences. But, not to be disgusted or    deterred, whenever she can glean one pretty enough, she brings    it to me. Here is the bouquet,--a very delicate rose, with its    half-blown bud, heliotrope, geranium, lady-pea, heart's-ease;    all sweet-scented flowers! Moved by their beauty, I wrote a    short note, to which this is the reply. Just like herself![B]    '"I should not love my flowers if they did not put forth all    the strength they have, in gratitude for your preserving care,    last winter, and your wasted feelings over the unavoidable    effects of the frost, that came so unexpectedly to nip their    budding beauties. I appreciate all you have done, knowing    at what cost any plant must be nourished by one who sows in    fields more precious than those opened, in early life, to my    culture. One must have grown up with flowers, and found joy    and sweetness in them, amidst disagreeable occupations, to    take delight in their whole existence as I do. They have long    had power to bring me into harmony with the Creator, and to    soothe almost any irritation. Therefore I understand your love    for these beautiful things, and it gives me real pleasure to    procure them for you.    '"You have done everything that the most affectionate and    loving daughter could, under all circumstances. My faith in    your generous desire to increase my happiness is founded on    the knowledge I have gained of your disposition, through your    whole life. I should ask your sympathy and aid, whenever it    could be available, knowing that you would give it first to    me. Waste no thought on neglected duties. I know of none.    Let us pursue our appointed paths, aiding each other in rough    places; and if I live to need the being led by the hand,    I always feel that you will perform this office wisely and    tenderly. We shall ever have perfect peace between us. Yours,    in all love."'Margaret adds:--    'It has been, and still is, hard for me to give up the thought    of serenity, and freedom from toil and care, for mother,    in the evening of a day which has been all one work of    disinterested love. But I am now confident that she will learn    from every trial its lesson; and if I cannot be her protector,    I can be at least her counsellor and soother.'From the less private parts of Margaret's correspondence with theyounger members of the family, some passages may be selected, asattesting her quick and penetrating sympathy, her strict truth,and influential wisdom. They may be fitly prefaced by these few butemphatic words from a letter of one of her brothers:--    "I was much impressed, during my childhood, at Groton, with    an incident that first disclosed to me the tenderness of    Margaret's character. I had always viewed her as a being    of different nature from myself, to whose altitudes of    intellectual life I had no thought of ascending. She had been    absent during the winter, and on her return asked me for some    account of my experiences. Supposing that she could not enter    into such insignificant details, I was not frank or warm in    my confidence, though I gave no reason for my reserve; and the    matter had passed from my mind, when our mother told me that    Margaret had shed tears, because I seemed to heed so little    her sisterly sympathy. 'Tears from one so learned,' thought I,    'for the sake of one so inferior!' Afterwards, my heart opened    to her, as to no earthly friend.    "The characteristic trait of Margaret, to which all    her talents and acquirements were subordinate, was    sympathy,--universal sympathy. She had that large intelligence    and magnanimity which enabled her to comprehend the struggles    and triumphs of every form of character. Loving all about her,    whether rich or poor, rude or cultivated, as equally formed    after a Divine Original, with an equal birth-right of immortal    growth, she regarded rather their aspirations than their    accomplishments. And this was the source of her marvellous    influence. Those who had never thought of their own destiny,    nor put faith in their own faculties, found in her society not    so much a display of her gifts, as surprising discoveries of    their own. She revealed to them the truth, that all can be    noble by fidelity to the highest self. She appreciated, with    delicate tenderness, each one's peculiar trials, and, while    never attempting to make the unhappy feel that their miseries    were unreal, she pointed out the compensations of their    lot, and taught them how to live above misfortune. She had    consolation and advice for every one in trouble, and wrote    long letters to many friends, at the expense not only of    precious time, but of physical pain.    "When now, with the experience of a man, I look back upon her    wise guardianship over our childhood, her indefatigable labors    for our education, her constant supervision in our family    affairs, her minute instructions as to the management of    multifarious details, her painful conscientiousness in every    duty; and then reflect on her native inaptitude and even    disgust for practical affairs, on her sacrifice,--in the    very flower of her genius,--of her favorite pursuits, on her    incessant drudgery and waste of health, on her patient    bearing of burdens, and courageous conflict with difficult    circumstances, her character stands before me as heroic."It was to this brother that Margaret wrote as follows:--    'It is a great pleasure to me to give you this book; both that    I have a brother whom I think worthy to value it, and that    I can give him something worthy to be valued more and more    through all his life. Whatever height we may attain in    knowledge, whatever facility in the expression of thoughts,    will only enable us to do more justice to what is drawn    from so deep a source of faith and intellect, and arrayed,    oftentimes, in the fairest hues of nature. Yet it may not be    well for a young mind to dwell too near one tuned to so high    a pitch as this writer, lest, by trying to come into concord    with him, the natural tones be overstrained, and the strings    weakened by untimely pressure. Do not attempt, therefore, to    read this book through, but keep it with you, and when the    spirit is fresh and earnest turn to it. It is full of the    tide-marks of great thoughts, but these can be understood    by one only who has gained, by experience, some knowledge of    these tides. The ancient sages knew how to greet a brother who    had consecrated his life to thought, and was never disturbed    from his purpose by a lower aim. But it is only to those    perfected in purity that Pythagoras can show a golden thigh.    'One word as to your late readings. They came in a timely way    to admonish you, amidst mere disciplines, as to the future    uses of such disciplines. But systems of philosophy are mere    pictures to him, who has not yet learned how to systematize.    From an inward opening of your nature these knowledges must    begin to be evolved, ere you can apprehend aught beyond    their beauty, as revealed in the mind of another. Study in a    reverent and patient spirit, blessing the day that leads you    the least step onward. Do not ride hobbies. Do not hasten    to conclusions. Be not coldly sceptical towards any thinker,    neither credulous of his views. A man, whose mind is full of    error, may give us the genial sense of truth, as a tropical    sun, while it rears crocodiles, yet ripens the wine of the    palm-tree.    'To turn again to my Ancients: while they believed in    self-reliance with a force little known in our day, they    dreaded no pains of initiation, but fitted themselves for    intelligent recognition of the truths on which our being is    based, by slow gradations of travel, study, speech, silence,    bravery, and patience. That so it may be with you, dear ----,    hopes your sister and friend.'A few extracts from family letters written at different times, andunder various conditions, may be added.    'I read with great interest the papers you left with me. The    picture and the emotions suggested are genuine. The youthful    figure, no doubt, stands portress at the gate of Infinite    Beauty; yet I would say to one I loved as I do you, do not    waste these emotions, nor the occasions which excite them.    There is danger of prodigality,--of lavishing the best    treasures of the breast on objects that cannot be the    permanent ones. It is true, that whatever thought is awakened    in the mind becomes truly ours; but it is a great happiness    to owe these influences to a cause so proportioned to our    strength as to grow with it. I say this merely because I    fear that the virginity of heart which I believe essential    to feeling a real love, in all its force and purity, may    be endangered by too careless excursions into the realms of    fancy.'       *       *       *       *       *    'It is told us, we should pray, "lead us not into temptation;"    and I agree. Yet I think it cannot be, that, with a good    disposition, and the means you have had to form your mind and    discern a higher standard, your conduct or happiness can be    so dependent on circumstances, as you seem to think. I never    advised your taking a course which would blunt your finer    powers and I do not believe that winning the means of    pecuniary independence need do so. I have not found that it    does, in my own case, placed at much greater disadvantage than    you are. I have never considered, either, that there was    any misfortune in your lot. Health, good abilities, and a    well-placed youth, form a union of advantages possessed by    few, and which leaves you little excuse for fault or failure.    And so to your better genius and the instruction of the One    Wise, I commend you.'       *       *       *       *       *    'It gave me great pleasure to get your last letter, for these    little impromptu effusions are the genuine letters. I rejoice    that man and nature seem harmonious to you, and that the heart    beats in unison with the voices of Spring. May all that is    manly, sincere, and pure, in your wishes, be realized! Obliged    to live myself without the sanctuary of the central relations,    yet feeling I must still not despair, nor fail to profit by    the precious gifts of life, while "leaning upon our Father's    hand," I still rejoice, if any one can, in the true temper,    and with well-founded hopes, secure a greater completeness of    earthly existence. This fortune is as likely to be yours, as    any one's I know. It seems to me dangerous, however, to meddle    with the future. I never lay my hand on it to grasp it with    impunity.'       *       *       *       *       *    'Of late I have often thought of you with strong yearnings of    affection and desire to see you. It would seem to me, also,    that I had not devoted myself to you enough, if I were not    conscious that by any more attention to the absent than I have    paid, I should have missed the needed instructions from the    present. And I feel that any bond of true value will endure    necessary neglect.'       *       *       *       *       *    'There is almost too much of bitter mixed in the cup of life.    You say religion is a mere sentiment with you, and that if    you are disappointed in your first, your very first hopes and    plans, you do not know whether you shall be able to act well.    I do not myself see how a reflecting soul can endure the    passage through life, except by confidence in a Power that    must at last order all things right, and the resolution that    it shall not be our own fault if we are not happy,--that we    will resolutely deserve to be happy. There are many bright    glimpses in life, many still hours; much worthy toil, some    deep and noble joys; but, then, there are so many, and such    long, intervals, when we are kept from all we want, and must    perish but for such thoughts.'       *       *       *       *       *    'You need not fear, dear ----, my doing anything to chill    you. I am only too glad of the pure happiness you so sweetly    describe. I well understand what you say of its invigorating    you for every enterprise. I was always sure it would be so    with me,--that resigned, I could do well, but happy I could    do excellently. Happiness must, with the well-born, expand    the generous affections towards all men, and invigorate one to    deserve what the gods have given.'Margaret's charities and courtesies were not limited to her kindred.She fell, at once, into agreeable relations with her domestics,became their confidant, teacher, and helper, studied their characters,consulted their convenience, warned them of their dangers orweaknesses, and rejoiced to gratify their worthy tastes; and, inreturn, no lady could receive, from servants, more punctual or heartyattendance. She knew how to command and how to persuade, and hersympathy was perfect. They felt the power of her mind, her hardydirectness, prompt judgment, decision and fertility of resource, andliked to aid one who knew so well her own wants. 'Around my path,' shewrites,    'how much humble love continually flows. These every-day and    lowly friends never forget my wishes, never censure my    whims, make no demands on me, and load me with gifts and    uncomplaining service. Though sometimes forgetful of their    claims, I try to make it up when we do meet, and I trust give    little pain as I pass along this world.'Even in extreme cases of debasement she found more to admire than tocontemn, and won the confidence of the fallen by manifesting her realrespect. "There was in my family," writes a friend, "a very handsomeyoung girl, who had been vicious in her habits, and so enamored ofone of her lovers, that when he deserted her, she attempted to drownherself. She was rescued, and some good people were eager to reformher life. While she was engaged in housework for us, Margaret saw her,and one day asked ---- if she could not help her. ---- replied: 'No!for should I begin to talk with her, I should show my consciousness ofher history so much as to be painful.' Margaret was very indignant atthis weakness. Said she,    'This girl is taken away, you know, from all her objects of    interest, and must feel her life vacant and dreary. Her mind    should be employed; she should be made to feel her powers.'It was plain that if Margaret had been near her, she would havedevoted herself at once to her education and reestablishment."About the time of breaking up their home, Margaret thus expressed, toone of her brothers, her hopes and plans.    'You wish, dear ----, that I was not obliged to toil and spin,    but could live, for a while, like the lilies. I wish so,    too, for life has fatigued me, my strength is little, and the    present state of my mind demands repose and refreshment,    that it may ripen some fruit worthy of the long and deep    experiences through which I have passed. I do not regret that    I have shared the labors and cares of the suffering million,    and have acquired a feeling sense of the conditions under    which the Divine has appointed the development of the human.    Yet, if our family affairs could now be so arranged, that I    might be tolerably tranquil for the next six or eight years,    I should go out of life better satisfied with the page I have    turned in it, than I shall if I must still toil on. A noble    career is yet before me, if I can be unimpeded by cares. I    have given almost all my young energies to personal relations;    but, at present, I feel inclined to impel the general stream    of thought. Let my nearest friends also wish that I should now    take share in more public life.'[Footnote A: Summer on the Lakes.][Footnote B: The editor must offer as excuse for printing, withoutpermission asked, this note, found carefully preserved amongMargaret's papers, that he knew no other way of so truly indicatingthe relation between mother and daughter. This lily is eloquent of thevalley where it grew. W.H.C.]THE HIGHLANDS.Seeking thus, at once, expansion and rest in new employments, Margaretdetermined, in the autumn of 1844, to accept a liberal offer ofMessrs. Greeley and McElrath, to become a constant contributor to theNew York Tribune. But before entering upon her new duties, she foundrelaxation, for a few weeks, amid the grand scenery of the Hudson. InOctober, she writes from Fishkill Landing:--    'Can I find words to tell you how I enjoy being here,    encircled by the majestic beauty of these mountains? I felt    regret, indeed, in bidding farewell to Boston, so many    marks of affection were shown me at the last, and so many    friendships, true if imperfect, were left behind. But now I am    glad to feel enfranchized in the society of Nature. I have a    well-ordered, quiet house to dwell in, with nobody's humors    to consult but my own. From my windows I see over the tops of    variegated trees the river, with its purple heights beyond,    and a few moments' walk brings me to the lovely shore, where    sails are gliding continually by, and the huge steamers sweep    past with echoing tread, and a train of waves, whose rush    relieves the monotone of the ripples. In the country behind us    are mountain-paths, and lonely glens, with gurgling streams,    and many-voiced water-falls. And over all are spread the    gorgeous hues of autumn.'And again:--    '"From the brain of the purple mountain" flows forth cheer    to my somewhat weary mind. I feel refreshed amid these bolder    shapes of nature. Mere gentle and winning landscapes are not    enough. How I wish my birth had been cast among the sources    of the streams, where the voice of hidden torrents is heard    by night, and the eagle soars, and the thunder resounds in    prolonged peals, and wide blue shadows fall like brooding    wings across the valleys! Amid such scenes, I expand and feel    at home. All the fine days I spend among the mountain passes,    along the mountain brooks, or beside the stately river. I    enjoy just the tranquil happiness I need in communion with    this fair grandeur.'And, again:--    'The boldness, sweetness, and variety here, are just what    I like. I could pass the autumn in watching the exquisite    changes of light and shade on the heights across the river.    How idle to pretend that one could live and write as well amid    fallow flat fields! This majesty, this calm splendor, could    not but exhilarate the mind, and make it nobly free and    plastic.'These few weeks among the Highlands,--spent mostly in the open air,under October's golden sunshine, the slumberous softness of the Indiansummer, or the brilliant, breezy skies of November,--were an importantera for Margaret. She had--                      "lost the dream of Doing              And the other dream of Done;                The first spring in the pursuing,              The first pride in the Begun,  First recoil from incompleteness in the face of what is won."But she was striving, also, to use her own words, 'to be patient tothe very depths of the heart, to expect no hasty realizations, not tomake her own plan her law of life, but to learn the law and plan ofGod.' She adds, however:--    'What heaven it must be to have the happy sense of    accomplishing something, and to feel the glow of action    without exhausted weariness! Surely the race would have worn    itself out by corrosion, if men in all ages had suffered, as    we now do, from the consciousness of an unattained Ideal.'Extracts from journals will best reveal her state of mind.    'I have a dim consciousness of what the terrible experiences    must be by which the free poetic element is harmonized with    the spirit of religion. In their essence and their end these    are one, but rarely in actual existence. I would keep what    was pure and noble in my old native freedom, with that    consciousness of falling below the best convictions which now    binds me to the basest of mankind, and find some new truth    that shall reconcile and unite them. Once it seemed to    me, that my heart was so capable of goodness, my mind of    clearness, that all should acknowledge and claim me as a    friend. But now I see that these impulses were prophetic of a    yet distant period. The "intensity" of passion, which so often    unfits me for life, or, rather, for _life here_, is to    be moderated, not into dulness or languor, but a gentler,    steadier energy.'    'The stateliest, strongest vessel must sometimes be brought    into port to rent. If she will not submit to be fastened to    the dock, stripped of her rigging, and scrutinized by unwashed    artificers, she may spring a leak when riding most proudly    on the subject wave. Norway fir nor English oak can resist    forever the insidious assaults of the seemingly conquered    ocean. The man who clears the barnacles from the keel is more    essential than he who hoists the pennant on the lofty mast.'       *       *       *       *       *    'A week of more suffering than I have had for a long    time,--from Sunday to Sunday,--headache night and day! And not    only there has been no respite, but it has been fixed in one    spot--between the eyebrows!--what does that promise?--till it    grew real torture. Then it has been depressing to be able to    do so little, when there was so much I had at heart to do.    It seems that the black and white guardians, depicted on the    Etrurian monuments, and in many a legend, are always fighting    for my life. Whenever I have any cherished purpose, either    outward obstacles swarm around, which the hand that would be    drawing beautiful lines must be always busy in brushing away,    or comes this great vulture, and fastens his iron talons on    the brain.    'But at such times the soul rises up, like some fair child in    whom sleep has been mistaken for death, a living flower in    the dark tomb. He casts aside his shrouds and bands, rosy and    fresh from the long trance, undismayed, not seeing how to get    out, yet sure there is a way.    'I think the black jailer laughs now, hoping that while I    want to show that Woman can have the free, full action of    intellect, he will prove in my own self that she has not    physical force to bear it. Indeed, I am too poor an example,    and do wish I was bodily strong and fair. Yet, I will not be    turned from the deeper convictions.'    'Driven from home to home, as a Renouncer, I gain the poetry    of each. Keys of gold, silver, iron, lead, are in my casket.    Though no one loves me as I would be loved, I yet love many    well enough to see into their eventual beauty. Meanwhile, I    have no fetters, and when one perceives how others are bound    in false relations, this surely should be regarded as a    privilege. And so varied have been my sympathies, that this    isolation will not, I trust, make me cold, ignorant, nor    partial. My history presents much superficial, temporary    tragedy. The Woman in me kneels and weeps in tender rapture;    the Man in me rushes forth, but only to be baffled. Yet the    time will come, when, from the union of this tragic king and    queen, shall be born a radiant sovereign self.'       *       *       *       *       *    'I have quite a desire to try my powers in a narrative poem;    but my head teems with plans, of which there will be time    for very few only to take form. Milton, it is said, made    for himself a list of a hundred subjects for dramas, and the    recorder of the fact seems to think this many. I think it very    few, so filled is life with innumerable themes.'       *       *       *       *       *    '_Sunday Evening._--I have employed some hours of the day,    with great satisfaction, in copying the Poet's Dreams from the    Pentameron of Landor. I do not often have time for such slow,    pleasing labor. I have thus imprinted the words in my mind, so    that they will often recur in their original beauty.    'I have added three sonnets of Petrarca, all written after the    death of Laura. They are among his noblest, all pertinent to    the subject, and giving three aspects of that one mood. The    last lines of the last sonnet are a fit motto for Boccaccio's    dream.    'In copying both together, I find the prose of the Englishman    worthy of the verse of the Italian. It is a happiness to see    such marble beauty in the halls of a contemporary.    'How fine it is to see the terms "onesto," "gentile," used in    their original sense and force.             'Soft, solemn day!      Where earth and heaven together seem to meet,        I have been blest to greet      From human thought a kindred sway;        In thought these stood        So near the simple Good,      That what we nobleness and honor call,      They viewed as honesty, the common dower of all.'Margaret was reading, in these weeks, the Four Books of Confucius,the Desatir, some of Taylor's translations from the Greek, a work onScandinavian Mythology, Moehler's Symbolism, Fourier's Noveau MondeIndustriel, and Landor's Pentameron,--but she says, in her journal,    'No book is good enough to read in the open air, among these    mountains; even the best seem partial, civic, limiting,    instead of being, as man's voice should be, a tone higher than    nature's.'And again:--    'This morning came ----'s letter, announcing Sterling's    death:--      '"Weep for Dedalus all that is fairest."    'The news was very sad: Sterling did so earnestly wish to do    a man's work, and had done so small a portion of his own. This    made me feel how fast my years are flitting by, and nothing    done. Yet these few beautiful days of leisure I cannot resolve    to give at all to work. I want absolute rest, to let the mind    lie fallow, to keep my whole nature open to the influx of    truth.'At this very time, however, she was longing to write with full freedomand power. 'Formerly,' she says,    'the pen did not seem to me an instrument capable of    expressing the spirit of a life like mine. An enchanter's    mirror, on which, with a word, could be made to rise all    apparitions of the universe, grouped in new relations; a magic    ring, that could transport the wearer, himself invisible, into    each region of grandeur or beauty; a divining-rod, to tell    where lie the secret fountains of refreshment; a wand, to    invoke elemental spirits;--only such as these seemed fit to    embody one's thought with sufficient swiftness and force. In    earlier years I aspired to wield the sceptre or the lyre; for    I loved with wise design and irresistible command to mould    many to one purpose, and it seemed all that man could desire    to breathe in music and speak in words, the harmonies of the    universe. But the golden lyre was not given to my hand, and I    am but the prophecy of a poet. Let me use, then, the slow pen.    I will make no formal vow to the long-scorned Muse; I assume    no garland; I dare not even dedicate myself as a novice; I    can promise neither patience nor energy:--but I will court    excellence, so far as an humble heart and open eye can merit    it, and, if I may gradually grow to some degree of worthiness    in this mode of expression, I shall be grateful.'WOMAN.It was on "Woman in the Nineteenth Century" that Margaret was nowtesting her power as a writer. 'I have finished the pamphlet,' shewrites, 'though the last day it kept spinning out beneath my hand.After taking a long walk, early one most exhilarating morning, I satdown to work, and did not give it the last stroke till near nine inthe evening. Then I felt a delightful glow, as if I had put a gooddeal of my true life in it, and as if, should I go away now, themeasure of my foot-print would be left on the earth.'A few extracts from her manuscripts upon this subject may be ofinterest, as indicating the spirit and aim with which she wrote:--    'To those of us who hate emphasis and exaggeration, who    believe that whatever is good of its kind is good, who shrink    from love of excitement and love of sway, who, while ready for    duties of many kinds, dislike pledges and bonds to any,--this    talk about "Woman's Sphere," "Woman's Mission," and all such    phrases as mark the present consciousness of an impending    transition from old conventions to greater freedom, are most    repulsive. And it demands some valor to lift one's head amidst    the shower of public squibs, private sneers, anger, scorn,    derision, called out by the demand that women should be put on    a par with their brethren, legally and politically; that they    should hold property not by permission but by right, and that    they should take an active part in all great movements. But    though, with Mignon, we are prompted to characterize heaven as    the place where       "Sie fragen nicht nach Mann nie Weib,"    yet it is plain that we must face this agitation; and beyond    the dull clouds overhead hangs in the horizon Venus, as    morning-star, no less fair, though of more melting beauty,    than the glorious Jupiter, who shares with her the watch.       *       *       *       *       *    'The full, free expression of feeling must be rare, for this    book of Bettina Brentano's to produce such an effect. Men who    have lived in the society of women all their days, seem never    before to have dreamed of their nature; they are filled with    wonderment and delight at these revelations, and because    they see the woman, fancy her a genius. But in truth her    inspiration is nowise extraordinary; and I have letters from    various friends, lying unnoticed in my portfolio, which are    quite as beautiful. For one, I think that these veins of gold    should pass in secret through the earth, inaccessible to all    who will not take the trouble to mine for them. I do not like    Bettina for publishing her heart, and am ready to repeat to    her Serlo's reproof to Aurelia.'       *       *       *       *       *    'How terrible must be the tragedy of a woman who awakes to    find that she has given herself wholly to a person for whom    she is not eternally fitted! I cannot look on marriage as on    the other experiments of life: it is the one grand type that    should be kept forever sacred. There are two kinds of love    experienced by high and rich souls. The first seeks, according    to Plato's myth, another half, as being not entire in itself,    but needing a kindred nature to unlock its secret chambers    of emotion, and to act with quickening influence on all its    powers, by full harmony of senses, affections, intellect,    will; the second is purely ideal, beholding in its object    divine perfection, and delighting in it only in degree as    it symbolizes the essential good. But why is not this love    steadily directed to the Central Spirit, since in no form,    however suggestive in beauty, can God be fully revealed?    Love's delusion is owing to one of man's most godlike    qualities,--the earnestness with which he would concentrate    his whole being, and thus experience the Now of the I Am.    Yet the noblest are not long deluded; they love really the    Infinite Beauty, though they may still keep before them a    human form, as the Isis, who promises hereafter a seat at the    golden tables. How high is Michel Angelo's love, for instance,    compared with Petrarch's! Petrarch longs, languishes; and    it is only after the death of Laura that his muse puts on    celestial plumage. But Michel always soars; his love is a    stairway to the heavens.       *       *       *       *       *    'Might not we women do something in regard to this Texas    Annexation project? I have never felt that I had any call to    take part in public affairs before; but this is a great    moral question, and we have an obvious right to express our    convictions. I should like to convene meetings of the women    everywhere, and take our stand.       *       *       *       *       *    'Had Christendom but been true to its standard, while    accommodating its modes of operation to the calls of    successive times, woman would now have not only equal _power_    with man,--for of that omnipotent nature will never permit    her to be defrauded,--but a _chartered_ power, too fully    recognized to be abused. Indeed, all that is wanting is, that    man should prove his own freedom by making her free. Let    him abandon conventional restriction, as a vestige of that    Oriental barbarity which confined woman to a seraglio. Let    him trust her entirely, and give her every privilege already    acquired for himself,--elective franchise, tenure of property,    liberty to speak in public assemblies, &c.    'Nature has pointed out her ordinary sphere by the    circumstances of her physical existence. She cannot wander    far. If here and there the gods send their missives through    women, as through men, let them speak without remonstrance.    In no age have men been able wholly to hinder them. A Deborah    must always be a spiritual mother in Israel; a Corinna may    be excluded from the Olympic games, yet all men will hear her    song, and a Pindar sit at her feet. It is man's fault that    there ever were Aspasias and Ninons. These exquisite forms    were intended for the shrines of virtue.    'Neither need men fear to lose their domestic deities. Woman    is born for love, and it is impossible to turn her from    seeking it. Men should deserve her love as an inheritance,    rather than seize and guard it like a prey. Were they noble,    they would strive rather not to be loved too much, and to turn    her from idolatry to the true, the only Love. Then, children    of one Father, they could not err, nor misconceive one    another.    'Society is now so complex, that it is no longer possible to    educate woman merely as woman; the tasks which come to her    hand are so various, and so large a proportion of women are    thrown entirely upon their own resources. I admit that this    is not their state of perfect development; but it seems as    if heaven, having so long issued its edict in poetry and    religion, without securing intelligent obedience, now    commanded the world in prose, to take a high and rational    view. The lesson reads to me thus:--    'Sex, like rank, wealth, beauty, or talent, is but an accident    of birth. As you would not educate a soul to be an aristocrat,    so do not to be a woman. A general regard to her usual sphere    is dictated in the economy of nature. You need never enforce    these provisions rigorously. Achilles had long plied the    distaff as a princess, yet, at first sight of a sword, he    seized it. So with woman, one hour of love would teach her    more of her proper relations, than all your formulas and    conventions. Express your views, men, of what you _seek_ in    woman: thus best do you give them laws. Learn, women, what you    should _demand_ of men: thus only can they become themselves.    Turn both from the contemplation of what is merely phenomenal    in your existence, to your permanent life as souls. Man, do    not prescribe how the Divine shall display itself in woman.    Woman, do not expect to see all of God in man. Fellow-pilgrims    and helpmeets are ye, Apollo and Diana, twins of one heavenly    birth, both beneficent, and both armed. Man, fear not to yield    to woman's hand both the quiver and the lyre; for if her urn    be filled with light, she will use both to the glory of    God. There is but one doctrine for ye both, and that is the    doctrine of the SOUL.Thus, in communion with the serene loveliness of mother-earth, andinspired with memories of Isis and Ceres, of Minerva and Freia, andall the commanding forms beneath which earlier ages symbolized theirsense of the Divine Spirit in woman, Margaret cherished visions of thefuture, and responded with full heart to the poet's prophecy:--  "Then comes the statelier Eden back to men;  Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm;  Then springs the crowning race of human-kind."It was but after the usual order of our discordant life,--wherePurgatory lies so nigh to Paradise,--that she should thence besummoned to pass a Sunday with the prisoners at Sing-Sing. This wasthe period when, in fulfilment of the sagacious and humane counsels ofJudge Edmonds, a system of kind discipline, combined with education,was in practice at that penitentiary, and when the female departmentwas under the matronly charge of Mrs. E.W. Farnum, aided by Mrs.Johnson, Miss Bruce, and other ladies, who all united sisterlysympathy with energetic firmness. Margaret thus describes herimpressions:--    'We arrived on Saturday evening, in such resplendent    moonlight, that we might have mistaken the prison for a    palace, had we not known but too well what those massive walls    contained.    'Sunday morning we attended service in the chapel of the male    convicts. They listened with earnest attention, and many were    moved to tears. I never felt such sympathy with an audience    as when, at the words "Men and brethren," that sea of faces,    marked with the scars of every ill, were upturned, and the    shell of brutality burst apart at the touch of love. I    knew that at least heavenly truth would not be kept out by    self-complacence and dependence on good appearances.    'After twelve at noon, all are confined in their cells, that    the keepers may have rest from their weekly fatigue. But I was    allowed to have some of the women out to talk with, and the    interview was very pleasant. They showed the natural aptitude    of the sex for refinement. These women were among the    so-called worst, and all from the lowest haunts of vice. Yet    nothing could have been more decorous than their conduct,    while it was also frank; and they showed a sensibility    and sense of propriety, which would not have disgraced any    society. All passed, indeed, much as in one of my Boston    classes. I told them I was writing about Woman; and, as my    path had been a favored one, I wanted to gain information from    those who had been tempted and afflicted. They seemed to    reply in the same spirit in which I asked. Several, however,    expressed a wish to see me alone, as they could then say    _all_, which they could not bear to before one another. I    shall go there again, and take time for this. It is very    gratifying to see the influence these few months of gentle and    intelligent treatment have had upon these women; indeed, it is    wonderful.'So much were her sympathies awakened by this visit, that she rejoicedin the opportunity, soon after offered, of passing Christmas withthese outcasts, and gladly consented to address the women in theirchapel. "There was," says one present, "a most touching tenderness,blended with dignity, in her air and tone, as, seated in the desk, shelooked round upon her fallen sisters, and begun: 'To me the pleasantoffice has been given, of 'wishing you a happy Christmas.' Asimultaneous movement of obeisance rippled over the audience, witha murmured 'Thank you;' and a smile was spread upon those sadcountenances, like sunrise sparkling on a pool." A few words from thisdiscourse,--which was extemporaneous, but of which she afterward madean imperfect record,--will show the temper in which she spoke:--    'I have passed other Christmas days happily, but never felt    as now, how fitting it is that this festival should come among    the snows and chills of winter; for, to many of you, I    trust, it is the birth-day of a higher life, when the sun of    good-will is beginning to return, and the evergreen of hope    gives promise of the eternal year. * * *    'Some months ago, we were told of the riot, the license, and    defying spirit which made this place so wretched, and the    conduct of some now here was such that the world said:--"Women    once lost are far worse than abandoned men, and cannot be    restored." But, no! It is not so! I know my sex better. It is    because women have so much feeling, and such a rooted respect    for purity, that they seem so shameless and insolent, when    they feel that they have erred and that others think ill of    them. They know that even the worst of men would like to see    women pure as angels, and when they meet man's look of scorn,    the desperate passion that rises is a perverted pride, which    might have been their guardian angel. Might have been! Rather    let me say, which may be; for the great improvement so rapidly    wrought here gives us all warm hopes. * * *    'Be not in haste to leave these walls. Yesterday, one of you,    who was praised, replied, that "if she did well she hoped that    efforts would be made to have her pardoned." I can feel the    monotony and dreariness of your confinement, but I entreat    you to believe that for many of you it would be the greatest    misfortune to be taken from here too soon. You know, better    than I can, the temptations that await you in the world; and    you must now perceive how dark is the gulf of sin and sorrow,    towards which they would hurry you. Here, you have friends    indeed; friends to your better selves; able and ready to    help you. Born of unfortunate marriages, inheriting dangerous    inclinations, neglected in childhood, with bad habits and bad    associates, as certainly must be the case with some of you,    how terrible will be the struggle when you leave this shelter!    O, be sure that you are fitted to triumph over evil, before    you again expose yourselves to it! And, instead of wasting    your time and strength in vain wishes, use this opportunity to    prepare yourselves for a better course of life, when you are    set free. * * *    'When I was here before, I was grieved by hearing several of    you say, "I will tell you what you wish to know, if I can be    alone with you; but not before the other prisoners; for, if    they know my past faults, they will taunt me with them." O,    never do that! To taunt the fallen is the part of a fiend. And    you! you were meant by Heaven to become angels of sympathy and    love. It says in the Scripture: "Their angels do always behold    in heaven the face of my Father." So was it with you in your    childhood; so is it now. Your angels stand forever there to    intercede for you; and to you they call to be gentle and good.    Nothing can so grieve and discourage those heavenly friends as    when you mock the suffering. It was one of the highest praises    of Jesus, "The bruised reed he will not break." Remember that,    and never insult, where you cannot aid, a companion. * * *    'Let me warn you earnestly against acting insincerely, and    appearing to wish to do right for the sake of approbation    I know you must prize the good opinion of your friendly    protectors; but do not buy it at the cost of truth. Try to be,    not to seem. Only so far as you earnestly wish to do right for    the sake of right, can you gain a principle that will sustain    you hereafter; and that is what we wish, not fair appearances    now. A career can never be happy that begins with falsehood.    Be inwardly, outwardly true; then you will never be weakened    or hardened by the consciousness of playing a part; and if,    hereafter, the unfeeling or thoughtless give you pain, or    take the dreadful risk of pushing back a soul emerging    from darkness, you will feel the strong support of a good    conscience. * * *    'And never be discouraged; never despond; never say, "It is    too late." Fear not, even if you relapse again and again. Many    of you have much to contend with. Some may be so faulty, by    temperament or habit, that they can never on this earth lead a    wholly fair and harmonious life, however much they strive.    Yet do what you can. If in one act,--for one day,--you can do    right, let that live like a point of light in your memory; for    if you have done well once you can again. If you fall, do    not lie grovelling; but rise upon your feet once more, and    struggle bravely on. And if aroused conscience makes you    suffer keenly, have patience to bear it. God will not let you    suffer more than you need to fit you for his grace. At the    very moment of your utmost pain, persist to seek his aid, and    it will be given abundantly. Cultivate this spirit of prayer.    I do not mean agitation and excitement, but a deep desire for    truth, purity, and goodness, and you will daily learn how near    He is to every one of 'us.''These fragments, from a hasty report transcribed when the impressionsof the hour had grown faint, give but a shadow of the broad goodsense, hearty fellow-feeling, and pathetic hopefulness, which made soeffective her truly womanly appeal.This intercourse with the most unfortunate of her sex, and a desireto learn more of the causes of their degradation, and of the meansof restoring them, led Margaret, immediately on reaching New York, tovisit the various benevolent institutions, and especially the prisonson Blackwell's Island. And it was while walking among the beds of thelazar-house,--mis-called "hospital,"--which then, to the disgraceof the city, was the cess-pool of its social filth, that an incidentoccurred, as touching as it was surprising to herself. A woman waspointed out who bore a very bad character, as hardened, sulky, andimpenetrable. She was in bad health and rapidly failing. Margaretrequested to be left alone with her; and to her question, 'Are you'willing to die?' the woman answered, "Yes;" adding, with her usualbitterness, "not on religious grounds, though." 'That is well,--tounderstand yourself,' was Margaret's rejoinder. She then began totalk with her about her health, and her few comforts, until theconversation deepened in interest. At length, as Margaret rose togo, she said: 'Is there not anything I can do 'for you?' The womanreplied: "I should be glad if you will pray with me."The condition of these wretched beings was brought the more home toher heart, as the buildings were directly in sight from Mr. Greeley'shouse, at Turtle Bay, where Margaret, on her arrival, went to reside.'Seven hundred females,' she writes,    'are now confined in the Penitentiary opposite this point.    We can pass over in a boat in a few minutes. I mean to visit,    talk, and read with them. I have always felt great interest in    those women who are trampled in the mud to gratify the brute    appetites of men, and wished that I might be brought naturally    into contact with them. Now I am.'THE TRIBUNE AND HORACE GREELEY.It was early in December of 1844 that Margaret took up her abodewith Mr. and Mrs. Greeley, in a spacious old wooden mansion, somewhatruinous, but delightfully situated on the East River, which she thusdescribes:--    'This place is, to me, entirely charming; it is so completely    in the country, and all around is so bold and free. It is two    miles or more from the thickly settled parts of New York, but    omnibuses and cars give me constant access to the city, and,    while I can readily see what and whom I will, I can command    time and retirement. Stopping on the Haarlem road, you enter    a lane nearly a quarter of a mile long, and going by a small    brook and pond that locks in the place, and ascending a    slightly rising ground, get sight of the house, which,    old-fashioned and of mellow tint, fronts on a flower-garden    filled with shrubs, large vines, and trim box borders. On    both sides of the house are beautiful trees, standing fair,    full-grown, and clear. Passing through a wide hall, you come    out upon a piazza, stretching the whole length of the house,    where one can walk in all weathers; and thence by a step or    two, on a lawn, with picturesque masses of rocks, shrubs    and trees, overlooking the East River. Gravel paths lead, by    several turns, down the steep bank to the water's edge, where    round the rocky point a small bay curves, in which boats are    lying. And, owing to the currents, and the set of the tide,    the sails glide sidelong, seeming to greet the house as    they sweep by. The beauty here, seen by moonlight, is truly    transporting. I enjoy it greatly, and the _genius loci_    receives me as to a home.'Here Margaret remained for a year and more, writing regularly for theTribune. And how high an estimate this prolonged and near acquaintanceled her to form for its Editor, will appear from a few passages in herletters:--    'Mr. Greeley is a man of genuine excellence, honorable,    benevolent, and of an uncorrupted disposition. He is    sagacious, and, in his way, of even great abilities. In modes    of life and manner he is a man of the people, and of the    American people.' And again:--Mr. Greeley is in many ways    very interesting for me to know. He teaches me things, which    my own influence on those, who have hitherto approached me,    has prevented me from learning. In our business and friendly    relations, we are on terms of solid good-will and mutual    respect. With the exception of my own mother, I think him the    most disinterestedly generous person I have ever known.'And later she writes:--    'You have heard that the Tribune Office was burned to the    ground. For a day I thought it must make a difference, but it    has served only to increase my admiration for Mr. Greeley's    smiling courage. He has really a strong character.'On the other side, Mr. Greeley thus records his recollections of hisfriend:--    "My first acquaintance with Margaret Fuller was made through    the pages of 'The Dial.' The lofty range and rare ability    of that work, and its un-American richness of culture and    ripeness of thought, naturally filled the 'fit audience,    though few,' with a high estimate of those who were known    as its conductors and principal writers. Yet I do not now    remember that any article, which strongly impressed me, was    recognized as from the pen of its female editor, prior to the    appearance of 'The Great Lawsuit,' afterwards matured into the    volume more distinctively, yet not quite accurately, entitled    'Woman in the Nineteenth Century.' I think this can hardly    have failed to make a deep impression on the mind of every    thoughtful reader, as the production of an original, vigorous,    and earnest mind. 'Summer on the Lakes,' which appeared some    time after that essay, though before its expansion into    a book, struck me as less ambitious in its aim, but more    graceful and delicate in its execution; and as one of the    clearest and most graphic delineations, ever given, of the    Great Lakes, of the Prairies, and of the receding    barbarism, and the rapidly advancing, but rude, repulsive    semi-civilization, which were contending with most unequal    forces for the possession of those rich lands. I still    consider 'Summer on the Lakes' unequalled, especially in its    pictures of the Prairies and of the sunnier aspects of Pioneer    life.    "Yet, it was the suggestion of Mrs. Greeley,--who had spent    some weeks of successive seasons in or near Boston, and who    had there made the personal acquaintance of Miss Fuller, and    formed a very high estimate and warm attachment for her,--that    induced me, in the autumn of 1844, to offer her terms, which    were accepted, for her assistance in the literary department    of the Tribune. A home in my family was included in the    stipulation. I was myself barely acquainted with her, when she    thus came to reside with us, and I did not fully appreciate    her nobler qualities for some months afterward. Though we    were members of the same household, we scarcely met save at    breakfast; and my time and thoughts were absorbed in duties    and cares, which left me little leisure or inclination for the    amenities of social intercourse. Fortune seemed to delight    in placing us two in relations of friendly antagonism,--or    rather, to develop all possible contrasts in our ideas and    social habits. She was naturally inclined to luxury and a good    appearance before the world. My pride, if I had any, delighted    in bare walls and rugged fare. She was addicted to strong tea    and coffee, both which I rejected and contemned, even in the    most homoeopathic dilutions: while, my general health being    sound, and hers sadly impaired, I could not fail to find in    her dietetic habits the causes of her almost habitual illness;    and once, while we were still barely acquainted, when she    came to the breakfast-table with a very severe headache, I was    tempted to attribute it to her strong potations of the Chinese    leaf the night before. She told me quite frankly that she    'declined being lectured on the food or beverage she saw fit    to take;' which was but reasonable in one who had arrived    at her maturity of intellect and fixedness of habits. So    the subject was thenceforth tacitly avoided between us; but,    though words were suppressed, looks and involuntary gestures    could not so well be; and an utter divergency of views on this    and kindred themes created a perceptible distance between us.    "Her earlier contributions to the Tribune were not her best,    and I did not at first prize her aid so highly as I afterwards    learned to do. She wrote always freshly, vigorously, but not    always clearly; for her full and intimate acquaintance with    continental literature, especially German, seemed to have    marred her felicity and readiness of expression in her mother    tongue. While I never met another woman who conversed more    freely or lucidly, the attempt to commit her thoughts to paper    seemed to induce a singular embarrassment and hesitation. She    could write only when in the vein; and this needed often to be    waited for through several days, while the occasion sometimes    required an immediate utterance. The new book must be reviewed    before other journals had thoroughly dissected and discussed    it, else the ablest critique would command no general    attention, and perhaps be, by the greater number, unread. That    the writer should wait the flow of inspiration, or at least    the recurrence of elasticity of spirits and relative health of    body, will not seem unreasonable to the general reader; but    to the inveterate hack-horse of the daily press, accustomed to    write at any time, on any subject, and with a rapidity    limited only by the physical ability to form the requisite    pen-strokes, the notion of waiting for a brighter day, or a    happier frame of mind, appears fantastic and absurd. He would    as soon think of waiting for a change in the moon. Hence,    while I realized that her contributions evinced rare    intellectual wealth and force, I did not value them as I    should have done had they been written more fluently and    promptly. They often seemed to make their appearance 'a day    after the fair.'    "One other point of tacit antagonism between us may as well be    noted. Margaret was always a most earnest, devoted champion    of the Emancipation of Women, from their past and present    condition of inferiority, to an independence on Men. She    demanded for them the fullest recognition of Social and    Political Equality with the rougher sex; the freest access to    all stations, professions, employments, which are open to any.    To this demand I heartily acceded. It seemed to me, however,    that her clear perceptions of abstract right were often    overborne, in practice, by the influence of education and    habit; that while she demanded absolute equality for Woman,    she exacted a deference and courtesy from men to women, _as_    women, which was entirely inconsistent with that requirement.    In my view, the equalizing theory can be enforced only by    ignoring the habitual discrimination of men and women, as    forming separate _classes_, and regarding all alike as simply    _persons_,--as human beings. So long as a lady shall deem    herself in need of some gentleman's arm to conduct her    properly out of a dining or ball-room,--so long as she shall    consider it dangerous or unbecoming to walk half a mile alone    by night,--I cannot see how the 'Woman's Rights' theory    is ever to be anything more than a logically defensible    abstraction. In this view Margaret did not at all concur,    and the diversity was the incitement to much perfectly    good-natured, but nevertheless sharpish sparring between us.    Whenever she said or did anything implying the usual demand    of Woman on the courtesy and protection of Manhood, I was apt,    before complying, to look her in the face and exclaim with    marked emphasis,--quoting from her 'Woman in the Nineteenth    Century,'--'LET THEM BE SEA-CAPTAINS IF THEY WILL!' Of course,    this was given and received as raillery, but it did not tend    to ripen our intimacy or quicken my esteem into admiration.    Though no unkind word ever passed between us, nor any approach    to one, yet we two dwelt for months under the same roof, as    scarcely more than acquaintances, meeting once a day at a    common board, and having certain business relations with    each other. Personally, I regarded her rather as my wife's    cherished friend than as my own, possessing many lofty    qualities and some prominent weaknesses, and a good deal    spoiled by the unmeasured flattery of her little circle of    inordinate admirers. For myself, burning no incense on any    human shrine, I half-consciously resolved to 'keep my eye beam    clear,' and escape the fascination which she seemed to exert    over the eminent and cultivated persons, mainly women, who    came to our out-of-the-way dwelling to visit her, and who    seemed generally to regard her with a strangely Oriental    adoration.    "But as time wore on, and I became inevitably better and    better acquainted with her, I found myself drawn, almost    irresistibly, into the general current. I found that her    faults and weaknesses were all superficial and obvious to the    most casual, if undazzled, observer. They rather dwindled than    expanded upon a fuller knowledge; or rather, took on new and    brighter aspects in the light of her radiant and lofty soul. I    learned to know her as a most fearless and unselfish champion    of Truth and Human Good at all hazards, ready to be their    standard-bearer through danger and obloquy, and, if need be,    their martyr. I think few have more keenly appreciated    the material goods of life,--Rank, Riches, Power, Luxury,    Enjoyment; but I know none who would have more cheerfully    surrendered them all, if the well-being of our Race could    thereby have been promoted. I have never met another in whom    the inspiring hope of Immortality was so strengthened into    profoundest conviction. She did not _believe_ in our future    and unending existence,--she _knew_ it, and lived ever in the    broad glare of its morning twilight. With a limited income    and liberal wants, she was yet generous beyond the bounds of    reason. Had the gold of California been all her own, she would    have disbursed nine tenths of it in eager and well-directed    efforts to stay, or at least diminish, the flood of human    misery. And it is but fair to state, that the liberality she    evinced was fully paralleled by the liberality she experienced    at the hands of others. Had she needed thousands, and made    her wants known, she had friends who would have cheerfully    supplied her. I think few persons, in their pecuniary    dealings, have experienced and evinced more of the better    qualities of human nature than Margaret Fuller. She seemed to    inspire those who approached her with that generosity which    was a part of her nature.    "Of her writings I do not purpose to speak critically. I think    most of her contributions to the Tribune, while she remained    with us, were characterized by a directness, terseness,    and practicality, which are wanting in some of her earlier    productions. Good judges have confirmed my own opinion, that,    while her essays in the Dial are more elaborate and ambitious,    her reviews in the Tribune are far better adapted to win the    favor and sway the judgment of the great majority of readers.    But, one characteristic of her writings I feel bound to    commend,--their absolute truthfulness. She never asked how    this would sound, nor whether that would do, nor what would be    the effect of saying anything; but simply, 'Is it the truth?    Is it such as the public should know?' And if her judgment    answered, 'Yes,' she uttered it; no matter what turmoil it    might excite, nor what odium it might draw down on her    own head. Perfect conscientiousness was an unfailing    characteristic of her literary efforts. Even the severest    of her critiques,--that on Longfellow's Poems,--for which    an impulse in personal pique has been alleged, I happen with    certainty to know had no such origin. When I first handed her    the book to review, she excused herself, assigning the wide    divergence of her views of Poetry from those of the author and    his school, as her reason. She thus induced me to attempt the    task of reviewing it myself. But day after day sped by, and    I could find no hour that was not absolutely required for    the performance of some duty that _would not_ be put off, nor    turned over to another. At length I carried the book back to    her in utter despair of ever finding an hour in which even to    look through it; and, at my renewed and earnest request, she    reluctantly undertook its discussion. The statement of these    facts is but an act of justice to her memory.    "Profoundly religious,--though her creed was, at once, very    broad and very short, with a genuine love for inferiors in    social position, whom she was habitually studying, by her    counsel and teachings, to elevate and improve,--she won    the confidence and affection of those who attracted her, by    unbounded sympathy and trust. She probably knew the cherished    secrets of more hearts than any one else, because she freely    imparted her own. With a full share both of intellectual and    of family pride, she preeminently recognized and responded to    the essential brotherhood of all human kind, and needed but to    know that a fellow-being required her counsel or assistance,    to render her, riot merely willing, but eager to impart it.    Loving ease, luxury, and the world's good opinion, she stood    ready to renounce them all, at the call of pity or of duty.    I think no one, not radically averse to the whole system of    domestic servitude, would have treated servants, of whatever    class, with such uniform and thoughtful consideration,--a    regard which wholly merged their factitious condition in their    antecedent and permanent humanity. I think few servants ever    lived weeks with her, who were not dignified and lastingly    benefited by her influence and her counsels. They might be    at first repelled, by what seemed her too stately manner and    exacting disposition, but they soon learned to esteem and love    her.    "I have known few women, and scarcely another maiden, who had    the heart and the courage to speak with such frank compassion,    in mixed circles, of the most degraded and outcast portion of    the sex. The contemplation of their treatment, especially    by the guilty authors of their ruin, moved her to a calm and    mournful indignation, which she did not attempt to suppress    nor control. Others were willing to pity and deplore; Margaret    was more inclined to vindicate and to redeem. She did not    hesitate to avow that on meeting some of these abused, unhappy    sisters, she had been surprised to find them scarcely fallen    morally below the ordinary standard of Womanhood,--realizing    and loathing their debasement; anxious to escape it; and only    repelled by the sad consciousness that for them sympathy and    society remained only so long as they should persist in    the ways of pollution. Those who have read her 'Woman,' may    remember some daring comparisons therein suggested between    these Pariahs of society and large classes of their    respectable sisters; and that was no fitful expression,--no    sudden outbreak,--but impelled by her most deliberate    convictions. I think, if she had been born to large fortune, a    house of refuge for all female outcasts desiring to return to    the ways of Virtue, would have been one of her most cherished    and first realized conceptions.    "Her love of children was one of her most prominent    characteristics. The pleasure she enjoyed in their society    was fully counterpoised by that she imparted. To them she was    never lofty, nor reserved, nor mystical; for no one had ever    a more perfect faculty for entering into their sports, their    feelings, their enjoyments. She could narrate almost any    story in language level to their capacities, and in a manner    calculated to bring out their hearty and often boisterously    expressed delight. She possessed marvellous powers of    observation and imitation or mimicry; and, had she been    attracted to the stage, would have been the first actress    America has produced, whether in tragedy or comedy. Her    faculty of mimicking was not needed to commend her to the    hearts of children, but it had its effect in increasing the    fascinations of her genial nature and heartfelt joy in their    society. To amuse and instruct them was an achievement for    which she would readily forego any personal object; and her    intuitive perception of the toys, games, stories, rhymes,    &c., best adapted to arrest and enchain their attention, was    unsurpassed. Between her and my only child, then living, who    was eight months old when she came to us, and something over    two years when she sailed for Europe, tendrils of affection    gradually intertwined themselves, which I trust Death has not    severed, but rather multiplied and strengthened. She became    his teacher, playmate, and monitor; and he requited her with a    prodigality of love and admiration.    "I shall not soon forget their meeting in my office, after    some weeks' separation, just before she left us forever. His    mother had brought him in from the country and left him asleep    on my sofa, while she was absent making purchases, and he had    rolled off and hurt himself in the fall, waking with the shock    in a phrensy of anger, just before Margaret, hearing of his    arrival, rushed into the office to find him. I was vainly    attempting to soothe him as she entered; but he was running    from one end to the other of the office, crying passionately,    and refusing to be pacified. She hastened to him, in perfect    confidence that her endearments would calm the current of his    feelings,--that the sound of her well-remembered voice would    banish all thought of his pain,--and that another moment would    see him restored to gentleness; but, half-wakened, he did not    heed her, and probably did not even realize who it was that    caught him repeatedly in her arms and tenderly insisted that    he should restrain himself. At last she desisted in    despair; and, with the bitter tears streaming down her face,    observed:--'Pickie, many friends have treated me unkindly,    but no one had ever the power to cut me to the heart, as you    have!' Being thus let alone, he soon came to himself, and    their mutual delight in the meeting was rather heightened by    the momentary estrangement.    "They had one more meeting; their last on earth! 'Aunty    Margaret' was to embark for Europe on a certain day, and    'Pickie' was brought into the city to bid her farewell.    They met this time also at my office, and together we thence    repaired to the ferry-boat, on which she was returning to her    residence in Brooklyn to complete her preparations for the    voyage. There they took a tender and affecting leave of each    other. But soon his mother called at the office, on her way to    the departing ship, and we were easily persuaded to accompany    her thither, and say farewell once more, to the manifest    satisfaction of both Margaret and the youngest of her devoted    friends. Thus they parted, never to meet again in time. She    sent him messages and presents repeatedly from Europe; and he,    when somewhat older, dictated a letter in return, which was    joyfully received and acknowledged. When the mother of our    great-souled friend spent some days with us nearly two years    afterward, 'Pickie' talked to her often and lovingly of 'Aunty    Margaret,' proposing that they two should 'take a boat and go    over and see her,'--for, to his infantile conception, the low    coast of Long Island, visible just across the East River,    was that Europe to which she had sailed, and where she was    unaccountably detained so long. Alas! a far longer and more    adventurous journey was required to reunite those loving    souls! The 12th of July, 1849, saw him stricken down, from    health to death, by the relentless cholera; and my letter,    announcing that calamity, drew from her a burst of passionate    sorrow, such as hardly any bereavement but the loss of a    very near relative could have impelled. Another year had just    ended, when a calamity, equally sudden, bereft a wide circle    of her likewise, with her husband and infant son. Little did I    fear, when I bade her a confident Good-by, on the deck of her    outward-bound ship, that the sea would close over her earthly    remains, ere we should meet again; far less that the light    of my eyes and the cynosure of my hopes, who then bade her    a tenderer and sadder farewell, would precede her on the dim    pathway to that 'Father's house,' whence is no returning! Ah,    well! God is above all, and gracious alike in what he conceals    and what he discloses;--benignant and bounteous, as well when    he reclaims as when he bestows. In a few years, at farthest,    our loved and lost ones will welcome us to their home."Favorably as Mr. Greeley speaks of Margaret's articles in the Tribune,it is yet true that she never brought her full power to bear uponthem; partly because she was too much exhausted by previous over-work,partly because it hindered her free action to aim at popular effect.Her own estimate of them is thus expressed:--    'I go on very moderately, for my strength is not great, and    I am connected with one who is anxious that I should not    overtask it. Body and mind, I have long required rest and    mere amusement, and now obey Nature as much as I can. If    she pleases to restore me to an energetic state, she will    by-and-by; if not, I can only hope this world will not turn    me out of doors too abruptly. I value my present position very    much, as enabling me to speak effectually some right words to    a large circle; and, while I can do so, am content.'Again she says,--    'I am pleased with your sympathy about the Tribune, for I    do not find much among my old friends. They think I ought to    produce something excellent, while I am satisfied to aid    in the great work of popular education. I never regarded    literature merely as a collection of exquisite products, but    rather as a means of mutual interpretation. Feeling that many    are reached and in some degree helped, the thoughts of every    day seem worth noting, though in a form that does not inspire    me.'The most valuable of her contributions, according to her own judgment,were the Criticisms on Contemporary Authors in Europe and America. Afew of these were revised in the spring of 1846, and, in connectionwith some of her best articles selected from the Dial, WesternMessenger, American Monthly, &c., appeared in two volumes of Wiley andPutnam's Library of American Books, under the title of PAPERS ON ARTAND LITERATURE.SOCIETY.Heralded by her reputation, as a scholar, writer, and talker, andbrought continually before the public by her articles in the Tribune,Margaret found a circle of acquaintance opening before her, as wide,various, and rich, as time and inclination permitted her to know.Persons sought her in her country retreat, attracted alike by idlecuriosity, desire for aid, and respectful sympathy. She visited freelyin several interesting families in New York and Brooklyn: occasionallyaccepted invitations to evening parties, and often met, at thesomewhat celebrated _soirees_ of Miss Lynch, the assembled authors,artists, critics, wits, and _dilettanti_ of New York. As wasinevitable, also, for one of such powerful magnetic influence, liberalsoul and broad judgment, she once again became, as elsewhere she hadbeen, a confidant and counsellor of the tempted and troubled; and hergeniality, lively conversation, and ever fresh love, gave her a homein many hearts. But the subdued tone of her spirits at this period ledher to prefer seclusion.Of her own social habits she writes:--    'It is not well to keep entirely apart from the stream of    common life; so, though I never go out when busy, nor keep    late hours, I find it pleasanter and better to enter somewhat    into society. I thus meet with many entertaining acquaintance,    and some friends. I can never, indeed, expect, in America, or    in this world, to form relations with nobler persons than I    have already known; nor can I put my heart into these new ties    as into the old ones, though probably it would still respond    to commanding excellence. But my present circle satisfies    my wants. As to what is called "good society," I am wholly    indifferent. I know several women, whom I like very much,    and yet more men. I hear good music, which answers my social    desires better than any other intercourse can; and I love    four or five interesting children, in whom I always find more    genuine sympathy than in their elders.'Of the impression produced by Margaret on those who were but slightlyacquainted with her, some notion may be formed from the followingsketch:--    "In general society, she commanded respect rather than    admiration All persons were curious to see her, and in full    rooms her fine head and spiritual expression at once marked    her out from the crowd; but the most were repelled by what    seemed conceit, pedantry, and a harsh spirit of criticism,    while, on her part, she appeared to regard those around her    as frivolous, superficial, and conventional. Indeed, I must    frankly confess, that we did not meet in pleasant relations,    except now and then, when the lifting of a veil, as it were,    revealed for a moment the true life of each. Yet I was fond of    looking at her from a distance, and defending her when silly    people were inclined to cavil at her want of feminine graces.    Then I would say, 'I would like to be an artist now, that I    might paint, not the care-worn countenance and the uneasy air    of one seemingly out of harmony with the scene about her, but    the soul that sometimes looks out from under those large lids.    Michel Angelo would have made her a Sibyl.' I remember I was    surprised to find her height no greater; for her writings had    always given me an impression of magnitude. Thus I studied    though I avoided her, admitting, the while, proudly and    joyously, that she was a woman to reverence. A trifling    incident, however, gave me the key to much in her character,    of which, before, I had not dreamed. It was one evening, after    a Valentine party, where Frances Osgood, Margaret Fuller, and    other literary ladies, had attracted some attention, that,    as we were in the dressing-room preparing to go home, I    heard Margaret sigh deeply. Surprised and moved, I said,    'Why?'--'Alone, as usual,' was her pathetic answer, followed    by a few sweet, womanly remarks, touching as they were    beautiful. Often, after, I found myself recalling her look and    tone, with tears in my eyes; for before I had regarded her as    a being cold, and abstracted, if not scornful."Cold, abstracted, and scornful! About this very time it was thatMargaret wrote in her journal:--    'Father, let me not injure my fellows during this period of    repression. I feel that when we meet my tones are not so sweet    as I would have them. O, let me not wound! I, who know so well    how wounds can burn and ache, should not inflict them. Let my    touch be light and gentle. Let me keep myself uninvaded, but    let me not fail to be kind and tender, when need is. Yet I    would not assume an overstrained poetic magnanimity. Help    me to do just right, and no more. O, make truth profound and    simple in me!'Again:--    'The heart bleeds,--faith almost gives way, to see man's    seventy years of chrysalis. Is it not too long? Enthusiasm    must struggle fiercely to burn clear amid these fogs. In what    little, low, dark cells of care and prejudice, without    one soaring thought or melodious fancy, do poor    mortals--well-intentioned enough, and with religious    aspiration too--forever creep. And yet the sun sets to-day as    gloriously bright as ever it did on the temples of Athens, and    the evening star rises as heavenly pure as it rose on the    eye of Dante. O, Father! help me to free my fellows from the    conventional bonds whereby their sight is holden. By purity    and freedom let me teach them justice.'And yet again:--    'There comes a consciousness that I have no real hold on    life,--no real, permanent connection with any soul. I seem a    wandering Intelligence, driven from spot to spot, that I may    learn all secrets, and fulfil a circle of knowledge. This    thought envelopes me as a cold atmosphere. I 'do not see how I    shall go through this destiny. I can, if it is mine; but I do    not feel that I can.'Casual observers mistook Margaret's lofty idealism for personal pride;but thus speaks one who really knew her:--"You come like one of thegreat powers of nature, harmonizing with all beauty of the soul orof the earth. You cannot be discordant with anything that is true anddeep. I thank God for the noble privilege of being recognized by solarge, tender, and radiant a soul as thine."EUROPE.LETTERS        "I go to prove my soul.  I see my way, as birds their trackless way.  In some time, God's good time, I shall arrive  He guides me and the bird. In his good time!"  BROWNING.  "One, who, if He be called upon to face  Some awful moment, to which Heaven has joined  Great issues, good or bad for human kind,  Is happy as a lover, and attired  With sudden brightness, like a man inspired;  And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law  In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw."

In the spring of 1846, her valued friends, Marcus Spring andlady, of New York, had decided to make a tour in Europe, with theirson, and they invited Miss Fuller to accompany them. An arrangementwas soon made on such terms as she could accept, and the party sailedfrom Boston in the "Cambria," on the first of August. The followingnarrative is made up of letters addressed by her to variouscorrespondents. Some extracts, describing distinguished persons whomshe saw, have been borrowed from her letters to the New York Tribune.]TO MRS. MARGARET FULLER._Liverpool, Aug_. 16, 1846.My dear Mother:--The last two days at sea passed well enough, as a number of agreeablepersons were introduced to me, and there were several whom I knewbefore. I enjoyed nothing on the sea; the excessively bracing air soaffected me that I could not bear to look at it. The sight of landdelighted me. The tall crags, with their breakers and circlingsea-birds; then the green fields, how glad! We had a very fine day tocome ashore, and made the shortest passage ever known. The stewardesssaid, "Any one who complained this time tempted the Almighty." I didnot complain, but I could hardly have borne another day. I had noappetite; but am now making up for all deficiencies, and feel alreadya renovation beginning from the voyage; and, still more, from freedomand entire change of scene.We came here Wednesday, at noon; next day we went to Manchester; thefollowing day to Chester; returning here Saturday evening.On Sunday we went to hear James Martineau; were introduced to him,and other leading persons. The next day and evening I passed in thesociety of very pleasant people, who have made every exertion to giveme the means of seeing and learning; but they have used up all mystrength.LONDON.TO C.S.As soon as I reached England, I found how right we were in supposingthere was elsewhere a greater range of interesting character among themen, than with us. I do not find, indeed, any so valuable as three orfour among the most marked we have known; but many that are stronglyindividual, and have a fund of hidden life.In Westmoreland, I knew, and have since been seeing in London, a man,such as would interest you a good deal; Mr. Atkinson. He is sometimescalled the "prince of the English mesmerisers;" and he has the fineinstinctive nature you may suppose from that. He is a man of aboutthirty; in the fulness of his powers; tall, and finely formed, witha head for Leonardo to paint; mild and composed, but powerful andsagacious; he does not think, but perceives and acts. He is intimatewith artists, having studied architecture himself as a profession; buthas some fortune on which he lives. Sometimes stationary and actingin the affairs of other men; sometimes wandering about the world andlearning; he seems bound by no tie, yet looks as if he had relativesin every place.I saw, also, a man,--an artist,--severe and antique in his spirit; heseemed burdened by the sorrows of aspiration; yet very calm, as securein the justice of fate. What he does is bad, but full of a greatdesire. His name is David Scott. I saw another,--a pupil of De laRoche,--very handsome, and full of a voluptuous enjoyment of nature:him I liked a little in a different way.By far the most beauteous person I have seen is Joseph Mazzini. If youever see Saunders' "People's Journal," you can read articles by himthat will give you some notion of his mind, especially one on hisfriends, headed "Italian Martyrs." He is one in whom holiness haspurified, but somewhat dwarfed the man.       *       *       *       *       *Our visit to Mr. Wordsworth was fortunate. He is seventy-six; but hisis a florid, fair old age. He walked with us to all his haunts aboutthe house. Its situation is beautiful, and the "Rydalian Laurels" aremagnificent. Still, I saw abodes among the hills that I should havepreferred for Wordsworth; more wild and still more romantic. The freshand lovely Rydal Mount seems merely the retirement of a gentleman,rather than the haunt of a poet. He showed his benignity ofdisposition in several little things, especially in his attentions toa young boy we had with us. This boy had left the circus, exhibitingits feats of horsemanship, in Ambleside, "for that day only," at hisown desire to see Wordsworth; and I feared he would be dissatisfied,as I know I should have been at his age, if, when called to seea poet, I had found no Apollo flaming with youthful glory,laurel-crowned, and lyre in hand; but, instead, a reverend old manclothed in black, and walking with cautious step along the levelgarden-path. However, he was not disappointed; and Wordsworth, in histurn, seemed to feel and prize a congenial nature in this child.Taking us into the house, he showed us the picture of his sister,repeating with much expression some lines of hers, and those so famousof his about her, beginning "Five years," &c.; also, his own picture,by Inman, of whom he spoke with esteem. I had asked to see a picturein that room, which has been described in one of the finest of hislater poems. A hundred times had I wished to see this picture, yetwhen seen was not disappointed by it. The light was unfavorable, butit had a light of its own,--        "whose mild gleam  Of beauty never ceases to enrich  The common light."Mr. Wordsworth is fond of the hollyhock; a partiality scarcelydeserved by the flower, but which marks the simplicity of his tastes.He had made a long avenue of them, of all colors, from the crimsonbrown to rose, straw-color, and white, and pleased himself with havingmade proselytes to a liking for them, among his neighbors.I never have seen such magnificent fuchsias as at Ambleside, and therewas one to be seen in every cottage-yard. They are no longer hereunder the shelter of the green-house, as with us, and as they used tobe in England. The plant, from its grace and finished elegance, beinga great favorite of mine, I should like to see it as frequently and ofas luxuriant growth at home, and asked their mode of culture, whichI here mark down for the benefit of all who may be interested. Makea bed of bog-earth and sand; put down slips of the fuchsia, and givethem a great deal of water; this is all they need. People leave themout here in winter, but perhaps they would not bear the cold of ourJanuaries.Mr. Wordsworth spoke with more liberality than we expected of therecent measures about the Corn-laws, saying that "the principlewas certainly right, though whether existing interests had been ascarefully attended to as was right, he was not prepared to say," &c.His neighbors were pleased to hear of his speaking thus mildly, andhailed it as a sign that he was opening his mind to more light onthese subjects. They lament that his habits of seclusion keep himignorant of the real wants of England and the world. Living in thisregion, which is cultivated by small proprietors, where there islittle poverty, vice, or misery, he hears not the voice which cries soloudly from other parts of England, and will not be stilled by sweet,poetic suasion, or philosophy, for it is the cry of men in the jaws ofdestruction.It was pleasant to find the reverence inspired by this great and puremind warmest near home. Our landlady, in heaping praises upon him,added, constantly, "and Mrs. Wordsworth, too." "Do the people here,"said I, "value Mr. Wordsworth most because he is a celebrated writer?""Truly, madam," said she, "I think it is because he is so kind aneighbor."    "True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home."EDINBURGH.----DE QUINCEY.At Edinburgh we were in the wrong season, and many persons we mostwished to see were absent. We had, however, the good fortune to findDr. Andrew Combe, who received us with great kindness. I was impressedwith great and affectionate respect, by the benign and even temper ofhis mind, his extensive and accurate knowledge, accompanied by a largeand intelligent liberality. Of our country he spoke very wisely andhopefully.       *       *       *       *       *I had the satisfaction, not easily attainable now, of seeing DeQuincey for some hours, and in the mood of conversation. As onebelonging to the Wordsworth and Coleridge constellation (he, too,is now seventy years of age), the thoughts and knowledge of Mr. DeQuincey lie in the past, and oftentimes he spoke of matters now becometrite to one of a later culture. But to all that fell from his lips,his eloquence, subtle and forcible as the wind, full and gentlyfalling as the evening dew, lent a peculiar charm. He is an admirablenarrator; not rapid, but gliding along like a rivulet through a greenmeadow, giving and taking a thousand little beauties not absolutelyrequired to give his story due relief, but each, in itself, a separateboon.I admired, too, his urbanity; so opposite to the rapid, slang,Vivian-Greyish style, current in the literary conversation of theday. "Sixty years since," men had time to do things better and moregracefully.CHALMERS.With Dr. Chalmers we passed a couple of hours. He is old now, butstill full of vigor and fire. We had an opportunity of hearing afine burst of indignant eloquence from him. "I shall blush to my verybones," said he, "if the _Chaarrch_" (sound these two _rrs_ withas much burr as possible, and you will get an idea of his mode ofpronouncing that unweariable word,) "if the Chaarrch yield to thestorm." He alluded to the outcry now raised by the Abolitionistsagainst the Free Church, whose motto is, "Send back the money;" i.e.,the money taken from the American slaveholders. Dr. C. felt, thatif they did not yield from conviction, they must not to assault.His manner in speaking of this gave me a hint of the nature of hiseloquence. He seldom preaches now.       *       *       *       *       *A Scottish gentleman told me the following story:--Burns, still onlyin the dawn of his celebrity, was invited to dine with one of theneighboring so-called gentry, unhappily quite void of true gentleblood. On arriving, he found his plate set in the servants' room.After dinner, he was invited into a room where guests were assembled,and, a chair being placed for him at the lower end of the board, aglass of wine was offered, and he was requested to sing one of hissongs for the entertainment, of the company. He drank off the wine,and thundered forth in reply his grand song "For a' that and a' that,"and having finished his prophecy and prayer, nature's nobleman lefthis churlish entertainers to hide their heads in the home they haddisgraced.A NIGHT ON BEN LOMOND.At Inversnaid, we took a boat to go down Loch Lomond, to the littleinn of Rowardennan, from which the ascent is made of Ben Lomond. Wefound a day of ten thousand, for our purpose; but, unhappily, a largeparty had come with the sun, and engaged all the horses, so that if wewent, it must be on foot. This was something of an enterprise for me,as the ascent is four miles, and toward the summit quite fatiguing.However, in the pride of newly-gained health and strength, I wasready, and set forth with Mr. S. alone. We took no guide, and thepeople of the house did not advise us to take one, as they ought.On reaching the peak, the sight was one of beauty and grandeur such asimagination never painted. You see around you no plain ground, but onevery side constellations, or groups of hills, exquisitely dressed inthe soft purple of the heather, amid which gleam the lakes, like eyesthat tell the secrets of the earth, and drink in those of the heavens.Peak beyond peak caught from the shifting light all the colors ofthe prism, and, on the furthest, angel companies seemed hovering inglorious white robes.About four o'clock we began our descent. Near the summit, the tracesof the path are not distinct, and I said to Mr. S., after a while,that we had lost it. He said he thought that was of no consequence;we could find our way down. I said I thought it was, as the ground wasfull of springs that were bridged over in the pathway. He accordinglywent to look for it, and I stood still, because I was so tired I didnot like to waste any labor.Soon he called to me that he had found it, and I followed in thedirection where he seemed to be. But I mistook, overshot it, and sawhim no more. In about ten minutes I became alarmed, and called himmany times. It seems, he on his side shouted also, but the brow ofsome hill was between us, and we neither saw nor heard one another. Ithen thought I would make the best of my way down, and I shouldfind him when I arrived. But, in doing so, I found the justice of myapprehension about the springs, so soon as I got to the foot of thehills; for I would sink up to my knees in bog, and must go up thehills again, seeking better crossing places. Thus I lost much time.Nevertheless, in the twilight, I saw, at last, the lake, and the innof Rowardennan on its shore.Between me and it, lay, direct, a high heathery hill, which Iafterwards found is called "The Tongue," because hemmed in on threesides by a water-course. It looked as if, could I only get to thebottom of that, I should be on comparatively level ground. Ithen attempted to descend in the water-course, but, finding thatimpracticable, climbed on the hill again, and let myself down by theheather, for it was very steep, and full of deep holes. With greatfatigue, I got to the bottom, but when I was about to cross thewater-course there, I felt afraid, it looked so deep in the dimtwilight. I got down as far as I could by the root of a tree, andthrew down a stone. It sounded very hollow, and I was afraid to jump.The shepherds told me afterwards, if I had, I should probably havekilled myself, it was so deep, and the bed of the torrent full ofsharp stones.I then tried to ascend the hill again, for there was no other way toget off it; but soon sank down utterly exhausted. When able to get upagain, and look about me, it was completely dark. I saw, far below me,a light, that looked about as big as a pin's head, that I knew to befrom the inn at Rowardennan, but heard no sound except the rush of thewaterfall, and the sighing of the night wind.For the first few minutes after I perceived I had come to my night'slodging, such as it was, the circumstance looked appalling. I was verylightly clad, my feet and dress were very wet, I had only a littleshawl to throw round me, and the cold autumn wind had already come,and the night mist was to fall on me, all fevered and exhausted as Iwas. I thought I should not live through the night, or, if I did, Imust be an invalid henceforward. I could not even keep myself warm bywalking, for, now it was dark, it would be too dangerous to stir. Myonly chance, however, lay in motion, and my only help in myself; andso convinced was I of this, that I did keep in motion the whole ofthat long night, imprisoned as I was on such a little perch of thatgreat mountain.For about two hours, I saw the stars, and very cheery andcompanionable they looked; but then the mist fell, and I saw nothingmore, except such apparitions as visited Ossian, on the hill-side,when he went out by night, and struck the bosky shield, and called tohim the spirits of the heroes, and the white-armed maids, with theirblue eyes of grief. To me, too, came those visionary shapes. Floatingslowly and gracefully, their white robes would unfurl from the greatbody of mist in which they had been engaged, and come upon me with akiss pervasively cold as that of death. Then the moon rose. I couldnot see her, but her silver light filled the mist. Now I knew it wastwo o'clock, and that, having weathered out so much of the night, Imight the rest; and the hours hardly seemed long to me more.It may give an idea of the extent of the mountain, that, though Icalled, every now and then, with all my force, in case by chance someaid might be near, and though no less than twenty men, with theirdogs, were looking for me, I never heard a sound, except the rush ofthe waterfall and the sighing of the night wind, and once or twicethe startling of the grouse in the heather. It was sublime indeed,--anever-to-be-forgotten presentation of stern, serene realities. At lastcame the signs of day,--the gradual clearing and breaking up; somefaint sounds from I know not what; the little flies, too, arose fromtheir bed amid the purple heather, and bit me. Truly they were verywelcome to do so. But what was my disappointment to find the mist sothick, that I could see neither lake nor inn, nor anything to guideme. I had to go by guess, and, as it happened, my Yankee method servedme well. I ascended the hill, crossed the torrent, in the waterfall,first drinking some of the water, which was as good at that time asambrosia. I crossed in that place, because the waterfall made steps,as it were, to the next hill. To be sure, they were covered withwater, but I was already entirely wet with the mist, so that itdid not matter. I kept on scrambling, as it happened, in the rightdirection, till, about seven, some of the shepherds found me. Themoment they came, all my feverish strength departed, and they carriedme home, where my arrival relieved my friends of distress far greaterthan I had undergone; for I had my grand solitude, my Ossianicvisions, and the pleasure of sustaining myself; while they had onlydoubt, amounting to anguish, and a fruitless search through the night.Entirely contrary to my forebodings, I only suffered for this a fewdays, and was able to take a parting look at my prison, as I wentdown the lake, with feelings of complacency. It was a majestic-lookinghill, that Tongue, with the deep ravines on either side, and therichest robe of heather I have anywhere seen.Mr. S. gave all the men who were looking for me a dinner in thebarn, and he and Mrs. S. ministered to them; and they talked ofBurns,--really the national writer, and known by them, apparently,as none other is,--and of hair-breadth 'scapes by flood and fell.Afterwards they were all brought up to see me, and it was gratifyingto note the good breeding and good feeling with which they deportedthemselves. Indeed, this adventure created quite an intimate feelingbetween us and the people there. I had been much pleased before,in attending one of their dances, at the genuine independence andpoliteness of their conduct. They were willing to dance their Highlandflings and strathspeys, for our amusement, and did it as naturally andas freely as they would have offered the stranger the best chair.JOANNA BAILLIE.--HOWITTS.--SMITH.I have mentioned with satisfaction seeing some persons who illustratedthe past dynasty in the progress of thought here: Wordsworth, Dr.Chalmers, De Quincey, Andrew Combe. With a still higher pleasure,because to one of my own sex, whom I have honored almost above any,I went to pay my court to Joanna Baillie. I found on her brow, not,indeed, a coronal of gold; but a serenity and strength undimmed andunbroken by the weight of more than fourscore years, or by the scantyappreciation which her thoughts have received. We found her in herlittle calm retreat, at Hampstead, surrounded by marks of love andreverence from distinguished and excellent friends. Near her was thesister, older than herself, yet still sprightly and full of activekindness, whose character and their mutual relations she has, in oneof her last poems, indicated with such a happy mixture of sagacity,humor, and tender pathos, and with so absolute a truth of outline.       *       *       *       *       *Mary and William Howitt are the main support of the People's Journal.I saw them several times at their cheerful and elegant home. In MaryHowitt, I found the same engaging traits of character we are ledto expect from her books for children. At their house, I becameacquainted with Dr. Southwood Smith, the well-known philanthropist.He is at present engaged in the construction of good tenements,calculated to improve the condition of the working people.TO R.W.E._Paris, Nov. 16, 1846._--I meant to write on my arrival in London, sixweeks ago; but as it was not what is technically called "the season,"I thought I had best send all my letters of introduction at once, thatI might glean what few good people I could. But more than I expectedwere in town. These introduced others, and in three days I was engagedin such a crowd of acquaintance, that I had hardly time to dress, andnone to sleep, during all the weeks I was in London.I enjoyed the time extremely. I find myself much in my element inEuropean society. It does not, indeed, come up to my ideal, but somany of the encumbrances are cleared away that used to weary me inAmerica, that I can enjoy a freer play of faculty, and feel, if notlike a bird in the air, at least as easy as a fish in water.In Edinburgh, I met Dr. Brown. He is still quite a young man, but witha high ambition, and, I should think, commensurate powers. But all isyet in the bud with him. He has a friend, David Scott, a painter,full of imagination, and very earnest in his views of art. I had somepleasant hours with them, and the last night which they and I passedwith De Quincey, a real grand _conversazione_, quite in the Landorstyle, which lasted, in full harmony, some hours.CARLYLE.Of the people I saw in London, you will wish me to speak first of theCarlyles. Mr. C. came to see me at once, and appointed an evening tobe passed at their house. That first time, I was delighted with him.He was in a very sweet humor,--full of wit and pathos, without beingoverbearing or oppressive. I was quite carried away with the rich flowof his discourse; and the hearty, noble earnestness of his personalbeing brought back the charm which once was upon his writing, before Iwearied of it. I admired his Scotch, his way of singing his great fullsentences, so that each one was like the stanza of a narrative ballad.He let me talk, now and then, enough to free my lungs and change myposition, so that I did not get tired. That evening, he talked of thepresent state of things in England, giving light, witty sketchesof the men of the day, fanatics and others, and some sweet, homelystories he told of things he had known of the Scotch peasantry. Of youhe spoke with hearty kindness; and he told, with beautiful feeling, astory of some poor farmer, or artisan, in the country, who on Sundaylays aside the cark and care of that dirty English world, and sitsreading the Essays, and looking upon the sea.I left him that night, intending to go out very often to theirhouse. I assure you there never was anything so witty as Carlyle'sdescription of ---- ----. It was enough to kill one with laughing.I, on my side, contributed a story to his fund of anecdote on thissubject, and it was fully appreciated. Carlyle is worth a thousand ofyou for that;--he is not ashamed to laugh, when he is amused, but goeson in a cordial human fashion.The second time, Mr. C. had a dinner-party, at which was a witty,French, flippant sort of man, author of a History of Philosophy, andnow writing a Life of Goethe, a task for which he must be as unfit asirreligion and sparkling shallowness can make him. But he told storiesadmirably, and was allowed sometimes to interrupt Carlyle a little,of which one was glad, for, that night, he was in his more acridmood; and, though much more brilliant than on the former evening,grew wearisome to me, who disclaimed and rejected almost everything hesaid.For a couple of hours, he was talking about poetry, and the wholeharangue was one eloquent proclamation of the defects in his own mind.Tennyson wrote in verse because the schoolmasters had taught him thatit was great to do so, and had thus, unfortunately, been turned fromthe true path for a man. Burns had, in like manner, been turned fromhis vocation. Shakspeare had not had the good sense to see thatit would have been better to write straight on in prose;--and suchnonsense, which, though amusing enough at first, he ran to death aftera while. The most amusing part is always when he comes back to somerefrain, as in the French Revolution of the _sea-green_. In thisinstance, it was Petrarch and _Laura_, the last word pronounced withhis ineffable sarcasm of drawl. Although he said this overfifty times, I could not ever help laughing when _Laura_ wouldcome,--Carlyle running his chin out, when he spoke it, and his eyesglancing till they looked like the eyes and beak of a bird of prey.Poor Laura! Lucky for her that her poet had already got her safelycanonized beyond the reach of this Teufelsdrockh vulture.The worst of hearing Carlyle is that you cannot interrupt him. Iunderstand the habit and power of haranguing have increased very muchupon him, so that you are a perfect prisoner when he has once got holdof you. To interrupt him is a physical impossibility. If you get achance to remonstrate for a moment, he raises his voice and bearsyou down. True, he does you no injustice, and, with his admirablepenetration, sees the disclaimer in your mind, so that you are notmorally delinquent; but it is not pleasant to be unable to utter it.The latter part of the evening, however, he paid us for this, by aseries of sketches, in his finest style of railing and raillery, ofmodern French literature, not one of them, perhaps, perfectly just,but all drawn with the finest, boldest strokes, and, from his point ofview, masterly. All were depreciating, except that of Beranger. Of himhe spoke with perfect justice, because with hearty sympathy.I had, afterward, some talk with Mrs. C., whom hitherto I had only_seen_, for who can speak while her husband is there? I like her verymuch;--she is full of grace, sweetness, and talent. Her eyes are sadand charming. * * *After this, they went to stay at Lord Ashburton's, and I only sawthem once more, when they came to pass an evening with us. Unluckily,Mazzini was with us, whose society, when he was there alone, I enjoyedmore than any. He is a beauteous and pure music; also, he is a dearfriend of Mrs. C.; but his being there gave the conversation a turn to"progress" and ideal subjects, and C. was fluent in invectives onall our "rose-water imbecilities." We all felt distant from him, andMazzini, after some vain efforts to remonstrate, became very sad. Mrs.C. said to me, "These are but opinions to Carlyle; but to Mazzini, whohas given his all, and helped bring his friends to the scaffold, inpursuit of such subjects, it is a matter of life and death."All Carlyle's talk, that evening, was a defence of mereforce,--success the test of right;--if people would not behave well,put collars round their necks;--find a hero, and let them be hisslaves, &c. It was very Titanic, and anti-celestial. I wish the lastevening had been more melodious. However, I bid Carlyle farewell withfeelings of the warmest friendship and admiration. We cannot feelotherwise to a great and noble nature, whether it harmonize with ourown or not. I never appreciated the work he has done for his agetill I saw England. I could not. You must stand in the shadow of thatmountain of shams, to know how hard it is to cast light across it.Honor to Carlyle! _Hoch!_ Although in the wine with which we drinkthis health, I, for one, must mingle the despised "rose-water."And now, having to your eye shown the defects of my own mind, in thesketch of another, I will pass on more lowly,--more willing to beimperfect,--since Fate permits such noble creatures, after all, tobe only this or that. It is much if one is not only a crow ormagpie;--Carlyle is only a lion. Some time we may, all in full, beintelligent and humanly fair.CARLYLE, AGAIN._Paris, Dec, 1846._--Accustomed to the infinite wit and exuberantrichness of his writings, his talk is still an amazement anda splendor scarcely to be faced with steady eyes. He does notconverse;--only harangues. It is the usual misfortune of such markedmen,--happily not one invariable or inevitable,--that they cannotallow other minds room to breathe, and show themselves in theiratmosphere, and thus miss the refreshment and instruction which thegreatest never cease to need from the experience of the humblest.Carlyle allows no one a chance, but bears down all opposition, notonly by his wit and onset of words, resistless in their sharpness asso many bayonets, but by actual physical superiority,--raising hisvoice, and rushing on his opponent with a torrent of sound. This isnot in the least from unwillingness to allow freedom to others. On thecontrary, no man would more enjoy a manly resistance to his thought.But it is the habit of a mind accustomed to follow out its ownimpulse, as the hawk its prey, and which knows not how to stop inthe chase. Carlyle, indeed, is arrogant and overbearing; but in hisarrogance there is no littleness,--no self-love. It is the heroicarrogance of some old Scandinavian conqueror;--it is his nature, andthe untamable energy that has given him power to crush the dragons.You do not love him, perhaps, nor revere; and perhaps, also, he wouldonly laugh at you if you did; but you like him heartily, and like tosee him the powerful smith, the Siegfried, melting all the old ironin his furnace till it glows to a sunset red, and burns you, if yousenselessly go too near. He seems, to me, quite isolated,--lonely asthe desert,--yet never was a man more fitted to prize a man, could hefind one to match his mood. He finds them, but only in the past.He sings, rather than talks. He pours upon you a kind of satirical,heroical, critical poem, with regular cadences, and generally, nearthe beginning, hits upon some singular epithet, which serves as a_refrain_ when his song is full, or with which, as with a knittingneedle, he catches up the stitches, if he has chanced, now and then,to let fall a row. For the higher kinds of poetry he has no sense,and his talk on that subject is delightfully and gorgeously absurd. Hesometimes stops a minute to laugh at it himself, then begins anew withfresh vigor; for all the spirits he is driving before him seem to himas Fata Morgana, ugly masks, in fact, if he can but make them turnabout; but he laughs that they seem to others such dainty Ariels.His talk, like his books, is full of pictures; his critical strokesmasterly. Allow for his point of view, and his survey is admirable.He is a large subject. I cannot speak more or wiselier of him now, norneeds it;--his works are true, to blame and praise him,--the Siegfriedof England,--great and powerful, if not quite invulnerable, and of amight rather to destroy evil, than legislate for good.Of Dr. Wilkinson I saw a good deal, and found him a substantialperson,--a sane, strong, and well-exercised mind,--but in the lastdegree unpoetical in its structure. He is very simple, natural, andgood; excellent to see, though one cannot go far with him; and hewould be worth more in writing, if he could get time to write, than inpersonal intercourse. He may yet find time;--he is scarcely more thanthirty. Dr. W. wished to introduce me to Mr. Clissold, but I had nottime; shall find it, if in London again. Tennyson was not in town.Browning has just married Miss Barrett, and gone to Italy. I may meetthem there. Bailey is helping his father with a newspaper! His wifeand child (Philip Festus by name) came to see me. I am to make them avisit on my return. Marston I saw several times, and found him fullof talent. That is all I want to say at present;--he is a delicatenature, that can only be known in its own way and time. I went to seehis "Patrician's Daughter." It is an admirable play for the stage. Atthe house of W.J. Fox, I saw first himself, an eloquent man, of greatpractical ability, then Cooper, (of the "Purgatory of Suicides,") andothers.My poor selection of miscellanies has been courteously greeted inthe London journals. Openings were made for me to write, had I butleisure; it is for that I look to a second stay in London, sinceseveral topics came before me on which I wished to write and publish_there_.       *       *       *       *       *I became acquainted with a gentleman who is intimate with all theEnglish artists, especially Stanfield and Turner, but was only able togo to his house once, at this time. Pictures I found but little timefor, yet enough to feel what they are now to be to me. I was only atthe Dulwich and National Galleries and Hampton Court. Also, have seenthe Vandykes, at Warwick; but all the precious private collectionsI was obliged to leave untouched, except one of Turner's, to which Igave a day. For the British Museum, I had only one day, which I spentin the Greek and Egyptian Rooms, unable even to look at the vastcollections of drawings, &c. But if I live there a few months, I shallgo often. O, were life but longer, and my strength greater! Ever I ambewildered by the riches of existence, had I but more time to openthe oysters, and get out the pearls. Yet some are mine, if only for anecklace or rosary.PARIS.TO HER MOTHER._Paris, Dec. 26, 1846._--In Paris I have been obliged to give agreat deal of time to French, in order to gain the power of speaking,without which I might as usefully be in a well as here. That hasprevented my doing nearly as much as I would. Could I remain sixmonths in this great focus of civilized life, the time would be alltoo short for my desires and needs.My Essay on American Literature has been translated into French, andpublished in "La Revue Independante," one of the leading journals ofParis; only, with that delight at manufacturing names for which theFrench are proverbial, they put, instead of _Margaret_, _Elizabeth_.Write to ----, that aunt Elizabeth has appeared unexpectedly beforethe French public! She will not enjoy her honors long, as a futurenumber, which is to contain a notice of "Woman in the NineteenthCentury," will rectify the mistake.I have been asked, also, to remain in correspondence with La RevueIndependante, after my return to the United States, which will be verypleasant and advantageous to me.I have some French acquaintance, and begin to take pleasure in them,now that we can hold intercourse more easily. Among others, a MadamePauline Roland I find an interesting woman. She is an intimate friendof Beranger and of Pierre Leroux.We occupy a charming suite of apartments, Hotel Rougement, BoulevardPoissoniere. It is a new hotel, and has not the arched gateways andgloomy court-yard of the old mansions. My room, though small, is verypretty, with the thick, flowered carpet and marble slabs; the Frenchclock, with Cupid, of course, over the fireplace, in which burns abright little wood fire; the canopy bedstead, and inevitable largemirror; the curtains, too, are thick and rich, the closet, &c.,excellent, the attendance good. But for all this, one pays dear. We donot find that one can live _pleasantly_ at Paris for little money; andwe prefer to economize by a briefer stay, if at all.TO E.H._Paris, Jan. 18, 1847,_ and _Naples, March 17, 1847._--You wished tohear of George Sand, or, as they say in Paris, "Madame Sand." I findthat all we had heard of her was true in the outline; I had supposedit might be exaggerated. She had every reason to leave her husband,--astupid, brutal man, who insulted and neglected her. He afterwards gaveup their child to her for a sum of money. But the love for which sheleft him lasted not well, and she has had a series of lovers, and Iam told has one now, with whom she lives on the footing of combinedmeans, independent friendship! But she takes rank in society like aman, for the weight of her thoughts, and has just given her daughterin marriage. Her son is a grown-up young man, an artist. Many womenvisit her, and esteem it an honor. Even an American here, and withthe feelings of our country on such subjects, Mrs. ----, thinks of herwith high esteem. She has broken with La Mennais, of whom she was oncea disciple.I observed to Dr. Francois, who is an intimate of hers, and loves andadmires her, that it did not seem a good sign that she breaks with herfriends. He said it was not so with her early friends; that she haschosen to buy a chateau in the region where she passed her childhood,and that the people there love and have always loved her dearly. Sheis now at the chateau, and, I begin to fear, will not come to townbefore I go. Since I came, I have read two charming stories recentlywritten by her. Another longer one she has just sold to _La Presse_for fifteen thousand francs. She does not receive nearly as muchfor her writings as Balzac, Dumas, or Sue. She has a much greaterinfluence than they, but a less circulation.She stays at the chateau, because the poor people there were sufferingso much, and she could help them. She has subscribed _twenty thousandfrancs_ for their relief, in the scarcity of the winter. It is a greatdeal to earn by one's pen: a novel of several volumes sold for onlyfifteen thousand francs, as I mentioned before. * * *At last, however, she came; and I went to see her at her house,Place d'Orleans. I found it a handsome modern residence. She had notanswered my letter, written about a week before, and I felt a littleanxious lest she should not receive me; for she is too much the markof impertinent curiosity, as well as too busy, to be easily accessibleto strangers. I am by no means timid, but I have suffered, for thefirst time in France, some of the torments of _mauvaise honte_, enoughto see what they must be to many.It is the custom to go and call on those to whom you bring letters,and push yourself upon their notice; thus you must go quite ignorantwhether they are disposed to be cordial. My name is always murderedby the foreign servants who announce me. I speak very bad French;only lately have I had sufficient command of it to infuse some of mynatural spirit in my discourse. This has been a great trial to me,who am eloquent and free in my own tongue, to be forced to feel mythoughts struggling in vain for utterance.The servant who admitted me was in the picturesque costume of apeasant, and, as Madame Sand afterward told me, her god-daughter,whom she had brought from her province. She announced me as "_MadameSalere,_" and returned into the ante-room to tell me. "_Madame saysshe does not know you_" I began to think I was doomed to a rebuff,among the crowd who deserve it. However, to make assurance sure, Isaid, "Ask if she has not received a letter from me." As I spoke,Madame S. opened the door, and stood looking at me an instant. Oureyes met. I never shall forget her look at that moment. The doorwaymade a frame for her figure; she is large, but well-formed. She wasdressed in a robe of dark violet silk, with a black mantle on hershoulders, her beautiful hair dressed with the greatest taste, herwhole appearance and attitude, in its simple and lady-like dignity,presenting an almost ludicrous contrast to the vulgar caricature ideaof George Sand. Her face is a very little like the portraits, butmuch finer; the upper part of the forehead and eyes are beautiful,the lower, strong and masculine, expressive of a hardy temperament andstrong passions, but not in the least coarse; the complexion olive,and the air of the whole head Spanish, (as, indeed, she was born atMadrid, and is only on one side of French blood.) All these detailsI saw at a glance; but what fixed my attention was the expression of_goodness_, nobleness, and power, that pervaded the whole,--the trulyhuman heart and nature that shone in the eyes. As our eyes met, shesaid, "_C'est vous_" and held out her hand. I took it, and went intoher little study; we sat down a moment, then I said, "_Il me fait debien de vous voir_" and I am sure I said it with my whole heart, forit made me very happy to see such a woman, so large and so developeda character, and everything that _is_ good in it so _really_ good. Iloved, shall always love her.She looked away, and said, "_Ah! vous m'avez ecrit une lettrecharmante_" This was all the preliminary of our talk, which then wenton as if we had always known one another. She told me, before I wentaway, that she was going that very day to write to me; that whenthe servant announced me she did not recognize the name, but aftera minute it struck her that it might be _La dame Americaine,_ asthe foreigners very commonly call me, for they find my name hardto remember. She was very much pressed for time, as she was thenpreparing copy for the printer, and, having just returned, there weremany applications to see her, but she wanted me to stay then, saying,"It is better to throw things aside, and seize the present moment." Istaid a good part of the day, and was very glad afterwards, for I didnot see her again uninterrupted. Another day I was there, and sawher in her circle. Her daughter and another lady were present, and anumber of gentlemen. Her position there was of an intellectual womanand good friend,--the same as my own in the circle of my acquaintanceas distinguished from my intimates. Her daughter is just about tobe married. It is said, there is no congeniality between her and hermother; but for her son she seems to have much love, and he loves andadmires her extremely. I understand he has a good and free character,without conspicuous talent.Her way of talking is just like her writing,--lively, picturesque,with an undertone of deep feeling, and the same skill in striking thenail on the head every now and then with a blow.We did not talk at all of personal or private matters. I saw, as onesees in her writings, the want of an independent, interior life, butI did not feel it as a fault, there is so much in her of her kind.I heartily enjoyed the sense of so rich, so prolific, so ardent agenius. I liked the woman in her, too, very much; I never liked awoman better.For the rest I do not care to write about it much, for I cannot, inthe room and time I have to spend, express my thoughts as I would; butas near as I can express the sum total, it is this. S---- and otherswho admire her, are anxious to make a fancy picture of her, andrepresent her as a Helena (in the Seven Chords of the Lyre); all whosemistakes are the fault of the present state of society. But to me thetruth seems to be this. She has that purity in her soul, for sheknows well how to love and prize its beauty; but she herself isquite another sort of person. She needs no defence, but only to beunderstood, for she has bravely acted out her nature, and always withgood intentions. She might have loved one man permanently, if shecould have found one contemporary with her who could interest andcommand her throughout her range; but there was hardly a possibilityof that, for such a person. Thus she has naturally changed theobjects of her affection, and several times. Also, there may have beensomething of the Bacchante in her life, and of the love of night andstorm, and the free raptures amid which roamed on the mountain-topsthe followers of Cybele, the great goddess, the great mother. But shewas never coarse, never gross, and I am sure her generous heart hasnot failed to draw some rich drops from every kind of wine-press. Whenshe has done with an intimacy, she likes to break it off suddenly, andthis has happened often, both with men and women. Many calumnies uponher are traceable to this cause.I forgot to mention, that, while talking, she _does_ smoke all thetime her little cigarette. This is now a common practice among ladiesabroad, but I believe originated with her.For the rest, she holds her place in the literary and social worldof France like a man, and seems full of energy and courage in it. Isuppose she has suffered much, but she has also enjoyed and done much,and her expression is one of calmness and happiness. I was sorry tosee her _exploitant_ her talent so carelessly. She does too much, andthis cannot last forever; but "Teverino" and the "Mare au Diable,"which she has lately published, are as original, as masterly in truth,and as free in invention, as anything she has done.Afterwards I saw Chopin, not with her, although he lives with her, andhas for the last twelve years. I went to see him in his room with oneof his friends. He is always ill, and as frail as a snow-drop, but anexquisite genius. He played to me, and I liked his talking scarcelyless. Madame S. loved Liszt before him; she has thus been intimatewith the two opposite sides of the musical world. Mickiewicz says,"Chopin talks with spirit, and gives us the Ariel view of theuniverse. Liszt is the eloquent _tribune_ to the world of men, alittle vulgar and showy certainly, but I like the tribune best." It issaid here, that Madame S. has long had only a friendship for Chopin,who, perhaps, on his side prefers to be a lover, and a jealous lover;but she does not leave him, because he needs her care so much, whensick and suffering. About all this, I do not know; you cannot knowmuch about anything in France, except what you see with your two eyes.Lying is ingrained in "_la grande nation_" as they so plainly show noless in literature than life.RACHEL.In France the theatre is living; you see something really good, andgood throughout. Not one touch of that stage-strut and vulgar bombastof tone, which the English actor fancies indispensable to scenicillusion, is tolerated here. For the first time in my life, I sawsomething represented in a style uniformly good, and should have foundsufficient proof, if I had needed any, that all men will prefer whatis good to what is bad, if only a fair opportunity for choicebe allowed. When I came here, my first thought was to go and seeMademoiselle Rachel. I was sure that in her I should find a truegenius. I went to see her seven or eight times, always in parts thatrequired great force of soul, and purity of taste, even to conceivethem, and only once had reason to find fault with her. On one singleoccasion, I saw her violate the harmony of the character, to produceeffect at a particular moment; but, almost invariably, I found hera true artist, worthy Greece, and worthy at many moments to have herconceptions immortalized in marble.Her range even in high tragedy is limited. She can only express thedarker passions, and grief in its most desolate aspects. Nature hasnot gifted her with those softer and more flowery attributes, thatlend to pathos its utmost tenderness. She does not melt to tears, orcalm or elevate the heart by the presence of that tragic beauty thatneeds all the assaults of fate to make it show its immortal sweetness.Her noblest aspect is when sometimes she expresses truth in somesevere shape, and rises, simple and austere, above the mixed elementsaround her. On the dark side, she is very great in hatred and revenge.I admired her more in Phedre than in any other part in which Isaw her; the guilty love inspired by the hatred of a goddess wasexpressed, in all its symptoms, with a force and terrible naturalness,that almost suffocated the beholder. After she had taken the poison,the exhaustion and paralysis of the system,--the sad, cold, calmsubmission to Fate,--were still more grand.I had heard so much about the power of her eye in one fixed look, andthe expression she could concentrate in a single word, that the utmostresults could only satisfy my expectations. It is, indeed, somethingmagnificent to see the dark cloud give out such sparks, each one fitto deal a separate death; but it was not that I admired most in her.It was the grandeur, truth, and depth of her conception of each part,and the sustained purity with which she represented it.The French language from her lips is a divine dialect; it is strippedof its national and personal peculiarities, and becomes what anylanguage must, moulded by such a genius, the pure music of the heartand soul. I never could remember her tone in speaking any word; itwas too perfect; you had received the thought quite direct. Yet, hadI never heard her speak a word, my mind would be filled by herattitudes. Nothing more graceful can be conceived, nor could thegenius of sculpture surpass her management of the antique drapery.She has no beauty, except in the intellectual severity of her outline,and she bears marks of race, that will grow stronger every year,and make her ugly at last. Still it will be a _grandiose_, gypsy,or rather Sibylline ugliness, well adapted to the expression of sometragic parts. Only it seems as if she could not live long; she expendsforce enough upon a part to furnish out a dozen common lives.TO R.W.E._Paris, Jan_. 18, 1847.--I can hardly tell you what a fever consumesme, from sense of the brevity of my time and opportunity. Here Icannot sleep at night, because I have been able to do so little inthe day. Constantly I try to calm my mind into content with smallachievements, but it is difficult. You will say, it is not so mightilyworth knowing, after all, this picture and natural history of Europe.Very true; but I am so constituted that it pains me to come away,having touched only the glass over the picture.I am assiduous daily at the Academy lectures, picture galleries,Chamber of Deputies,--last week, at the court and court ball. So faras my previous preparation enabled me, I get something from all thesebrilliant shows,--thoughts, images, fresh impulse. But I need,to initiate me into various little secrets of the place andtime,--necessary for me to look at things to my satisfaction,--somefriend, such as I do not find here. My steps have not been fortunatein Paris, as they were in England. No doubt, the person exists here,whose aid I want; indeed, I feel that it is so; but we do not meet,and the time draws near for me to depart.French people I find slippery, as they do not know exactly what tomake of me, the rather as I have not the command of their language._I_ see _them_, their brilliancy, grace, and variety, the thousandslight refinements of their speech and manner, but cannot meet themin their way. My French teacher says, I speak and act like an Italian,and I hope, in Italy, I shall find myself more at home.I had, the other day, the luck to be introduced to Beranger, who isthe only person beside George Sand I cared very particularly to seehere. I went to call on La Mennais, to whom I had a letter. I foundhim in a little study; his secretary was writing in a large roomthrough which I passed. With him was a somewhat citizen-looking, butvivacious elderly man, whom I was, at first, sorry to see, havingwished for half an hour's undisturbed visit to the Apostle ofDemocracy. But those feelings were quickly displaced by joy, when henamed to me the great national lyrist of France, the great Beranger.I had not expected to see him at all, for he is not to be seen in anyshow place; he lives in the hearts of the people, and needs no homagefrom their eyes. I was very happy, in that little study, in thepresence of these two men, whose influence has been so real andso great. Beranger has been much to me,--his wit, his pathos, andexquisite lyric grace. I have not received influence from La Mennais,but I see well what he has been, and is, to Europe.TO LA MENNAIS.Monsieur:--As my visit to you was cut short before I was quite satisfied, itwas my intention to seek you again immediately; although I felt somescruples at occupying your valuable time, when I express myself soimperfectly in your language. But I have been almost constantly illsince, and now am not sure of finding time to pay you my respectsbefore leaving Paris for Italy. In case this should be impossible, Itake the liberty to write, and to present you two little volumes ofmine. It is only as a tribute of respect. I regret that they do notcontain some pieces of mine which might be more interesting to you,as illustrative of the state of affairs in our country. Some such willfind their place in subsequent numbers. These, I hope, you will,if you do not read them, accept kindly as a salutation from ourhemisphere. Many there delight to know you as a great apostle ofthe ideas which are to be our life, if Heaven intends us a greatand permanent life. I count myself happy in having seen you, andin finding with you Beranger, the genuine poet, the genuine man ofFrance. I have felt all the enchantment of the lyre of Beranger;have paid my warmest homage to the truth and wisdom adorned with suchcharms, such wit and pathos. It was a great pleasure to see himself.If your leisure permits, Monsieur, I will ask a few lines in reply.I should like to keep some words from your hand, in case I should notlook upon you more here below; and am always, with gratitude for thelight you have shed on so many darkened spirits,Yours, most respectfully,MARGARET FULLER.       *       *       *       *       *_Paris, Jan_., 1847.--I missed hearing M. Guizot, (I am sorry for it,)in his speech on the Montpensier marriage. I saw the little Duchess,the innocent or ignorant topic of all this disturbance, when presentedat court. She went round the circle on the arm of the queen. Thoughonly fourteen, she looks twenty, but has something fresh, engaging,and girlish about her.I attended not only at the presentation, but at the ball given atthe Tuileries directly after. These are fine shows, as the suite ofapartments is very handsome, brilliantly lighted,--the French ladiessurpassing all others in the art of dress; indeed, it gave me muchpleasure to see them. Certainly there are many ugly ones; but they areso well dressed, and have such an air of graceful vivacity, thatthe general effect was of a flower-garden. As often happens, severalAmerican women were among the most distinguished for positive beauty;one from Philadelphia, who is by many persons considered the prettiestornament of the dress circle at the Italian opera, was especiallymarked by the attention of the king. However, these ladies, even ifhere a long time, do not attain the air and manner of Frenchwomen. The magnetic fluid that envelops them is less brilliant andexhilarating in its attractions.Among the crowd wandered Leverrier, in the costume of Academician,looking as if he had lost, not found, his planet. French _savants_ aremore generally men of the world, and even men of fashion, than thoseof other climates; but, in his case, he seemed not to find it easy toexchange the music of the spheres for the music of fiddles.Speaking of Leverrier leads to another of my disappointments. Iwent to the Sorbonne to hear him lecture, not dreaming that the oldpedantic and theological character of those halls was strictly kept upin these days of light. An old guardian of the inner temple seeing meapproach, had his speech all ready, and, manning the entrance, said,with a disdainful air, before we had time to utter a word, "Monsieurmay enter if he pleases, but madame must remain here" (_i.e._, inthe court-yard). After some exclamations of surprise, I found analternative in the Hotel de Clugny, where I passed an hour verydelightfully, while waiting for my companion.I was more fortunate in hearing Arago, and he justified all myexpectations. Clear, rapid, full, and equal, his discourse is worthyits celebrity, and I felt repaid for the four hours one is obliged tospend in going, in waiting, and in hearing, for the lecture begins athalf past one, and you must be there before twelve to get a seat, soconstant and animated is his popularity.I was present on one good occasion, at the Academy,--the day that M.Remusat was received there, in the place of Royer Collard. I lookeddown, from one of the tribunes, upon the flower of the celebrities ofFrance; that is to say, of the celebrities which are authentic, _commeil faut_. Among them were many marked faces, many fine heads; but,in reading the works of poets, we always fancy them about the age ofApollo himself, and I found with pain some of my favorites quite old,and very unlike the company on Parnassus, as represented by Raphael.Some, however, were venerable, even noble to behold.The poorer classes have suffered from hunger this winter. All signs ofthis are kept out of sight in Paris. A pamphlet called "The Voice ofFamine," stating facts, though in a tone of vulgar and exaggerateddeclamation, was suppressed as soon as published. While Louis Philippelives, the gases may not burst up to flame, but the need of radicalmeasures of reform is strongly felt in France; and the time will come,before long, when such will be imperatively demanded.FOURIER.The doctrines of Fourier are making progress, and wherever theyspread, the necessity of some practical application of the precepts ofChrist, in lieu of the mummeries of a worn-out ritual, cannot failto be felt. The more I see of the terrible ills which infest the bodypolitic of Europe, the more indignation I feel at the selfishnessor stupidity of those in my own country who oppose an examinationof these subjects,--such as is animated by the hope of prevention.Educated in an age of gross materialism, Fourier is tainted by itsfaults; in attempts to reorganize society, he commits the error ofmaking soul the result of health of body, instead of body the clothingof soul; but his heart was that of a genuine lover of his kind, of aphilanthropist in the sense of Jesus; his views are large and noble;his life was one of devout study on these subjects, and I should pitythe person who, after the briefest sojourn in Manchester and Lyons,the most superficial acquaintance with the population of London andParis, could seek to hinder a study of his thoughts, or be wanting inreverence for his purposes.ROUSSEAU.To the actually so-called Chamber of Deputies, I was indebted for asight of the manuscripts of Rousseau treasured in their library. I sawthem and touched them,--those manuscripts just as he has celebratedthem, written on the fine white paper, tied with ribbon. Yellow andfaded age has made them, yet at their touch I seemed to feel the fireof youth, immortally glowing, more and more expansive, with which hissoul has pervaded this century. He was the precursor of all we mostprize. True, his blood was mixed with madness, and the course of hisactual life made some _detours_ through villanous places; but hisspirit was intimate with the fundamental truths of human nature, andfraught with prophecy. There is none who has given birth to more lifefor this age; his gifts are yet untold; they are too present with us;but he who thinks really must often think with Rousseau, and learn himever more and more. Such is the method of genius,--to ripen fruit forthe crowd by those rays of whose heat they complain.TO R.W.E._Naples, March_ 15, 1847.--Mickiewicz, the Polish poet, firstintroduced the Essays to acquaintance in Paris. I did not meet himanywhere, and, as I heard a great deal of him which charmed me, I senthim your poems, and asked him to come and see me. He came, and Ifound in him the man I had long wished to see, with the intellect andpassions in due proportion for a full and healthy human being, with asoul constantly inspiring. Unhappily, it was a very short time beforeI came away. How much time had I wasted on others which I might havegiven to this real and important relation.After hearing music from Chopin and Neukomm, I quitted Paris on the25th February, and came, _via_ Chalons, Lyons, Avignon, (where I wadedthrough melting snow to Laura's tomb,) Arles, to Marseilles; thence,by steamer, to Genoa, Leghorn, and Pisa. Seen through a cutting wind,the marble palaces, the gardens, the magnificent water-view of Genoa,failed to charm. Only at Naples have I found _my_ Italy. BetweenLeghorn and Naples, our boat was run into by another, and we only justescaped being drowned.ROME._Rome, May_, 1847.--Of the fragments of the great time, I have nowseen nearly all that are treasured up here. I have as yet nothing ofconsequence to say of them. Others have often given good hints asto how they _look_. As to what they _are_, it can only be known byapproximating to the state of soul out of which they grew. They aremany and precious; yet is there not so much of high excellence asI looked for. They will not float the heart on a boundless sea offeeling, like the starry night on our Western Prairies. Yet I lovemuch to see the galleries of marbles, even where there are not manyseparately admirable, amid the cypresses and ilexes of Roman villas;and a picture that is good at all, looks best in one of these oldpalaces. I have heard owls hoot in the Colosseum by moonlight, andthey spoke more to the purpose than I ever heard any other voice onthat subject. I have seen all the pomps of Holy Week in St. Peter's,and found them less imposing than an habitual acquaintance with thechurch itself, with processions of monks and nuns stealing in, now andthen, or the swell of vespers from some side chapel. The ceremonies ofthe church have been numerous and splendid, during our stay, and theyborrow unusual interest from the love and expectation inspired by thepresent pontiff. He is a man of noble and good aspect, who has set hisheart on doing something solid for the benefit of man. A week ortwo ago, the Cardinal Secretary published a circular, invitingthe departments to measures which would give the people a sort ofrepresentative council. Nothing could seem more limited than thisimprovement, but it was a great measure for Rome. At night, theCorso was illuminated, and many thousands passed through it in atorch-bearing procession, on their way to the Quirinal, to thank thePope, upbearing a banner on which the edict was printed.TO W.H.C._Rome, May_ 7, 1847.--I write not to you about these countries, of thefamous people I see, of magnificent shows and places. All these thingsare only to me an illuminated margin on the text of my inward life.Earlier, they would have been more. Art is not important to me now.I like only what little I find that is transcendently good, and evenwith that feel very familiar and calm. I take interest in the stateof the people, their manners, the state of the race in them. I seethe future dawning; it is in important aspects Fourier's future. ButI like no Fourierites; they are terribly wearisome here in Europe; thetide of things does not wash through them as violently as with us, andthey have time to run in the tread-mill of system. Still, they servethis great future which I shall not live to see. I must be born again.TO R.W.E._Florence, June_ 20, 1847.--I have just come hither from Rome. Everyminute, day and night, there is something to be seen or done at Rome,which we cannot bear to lose. We lived on the Corso, and all nightlong, after the weather became fine, there was conversation or musicbefore my window. I never seemed really to sleep while there, and now,at Florence, where there is less to excite, and I live in a more quietquarter, I feel as if I needed to sleep all the time, and cannot restas I ought, there is so much to do.I now speak French fluently, though not correctly, yet well enoughto make my thoughts avail in the cultivated society here, where itis much spoken. But to know the common people, and to feel truly inItaly, I ought to speak and understand the spoken Italian well, andI am now cultivating this sedulously. If I remain, I shall have, formany reasons, advantages for observation and enjoyment, such as areseldom permitted to a foreigner.I forgot to mention one little thing rather interesting. At the_Miserere_ of the Sistine chapel, I sat beside Goethe's favoritedaughter-in-law, Ottilia, to whom I was introduced by Mrs. Jameson.TO R.F.F._Florence, July_ 1, 1847.--I do not wish to go through Germany ina hurried way, and am equally unsatisfied to fly through Italy; andshall, therefore, leaving my companions in Switzerland, take a servantto accompany me, and return hither, and hence to Rome for the autumn,perhaps the winter. I should always suffer the pain of Tantalusthinking of Rome, if I could not see it more thoroughly than I haveas yet even begun to; for it was all _outside_ the two months, justfinding out where objects were. I had only just begun to know them,when I was obliged to leave. The prospect of returning presents manycharms, but it leaves me alone in the midst of a strange land.I find myself happily situated here, in many respects. The MarchionessArconati Visconti, to whom I brought a letter from a friend of hersin France, has been good to me as a sister, and introduced me to manyinteresting acquaintance. The sculptors, Powers and Greenough, I haveseen much and well. Other acquaintance I possess, less known to fame,but not less attractive.Florence is not like Rome. At first, I could not bear the change; yet,for the study of the fine arts, it is a still richer place. Worlds ofthought have risen in my mind; some time you will have light from all.       *       *       *       *       *_Milan, Aug_. 9, 1847.--Passing from Florence, I came to Bologna. Awoman should love Bologna, for there has the intellect of woman beencherished. In their Certosa, they proudly show the monument to MatildaTambreni, late Greek professor there. In their anatomical hall, is thebust of a woman, professor of anatomy. In art, they have had Properziadi Rossi, Elisabetta Sirani, Lavinia Fontana, and delight to givetheir works a conspicuous place. In other cities, the men alone havetheir Casino dei Nobili, where they give balls and conversazioni.Here, women have one, and are the soul of society. In Milan, also, Isee, in the Ambrosian Library, the bust of a female mathematician.TO HER MOTHER._Lago di Garda, Aug_. 1, 1847.--Do not let what I have written disturbyou as to my health. I have rested now, and am as well as usual. Thisadvantage I derive from being alone, that, if I feel the need of it, Ican stop.I left Venice four days ago; have seen well Vicenza, Verona, Mantua,and am reposing, for two nights and a day, in this tranquil room whichoverlooks the beautiful Lake of Garda. The air is sweet and pure, andI hear no noise except the waves breaking on the shore.I think of you a great deal, especially when there are flowers.Florence was all flowers. I have many magnolias and jasmines. I alwayswish you could see them. The other day, on the island of San Lazaro,at the Armenian Convent, where Lord Byron used to go, I thought ofyou, seeing the garden full of immense oleanders in full bloom. Onesees them everywhere at Venice.TO HER TRAVELLING COMPANIONS AFTER PARTING._Milan, Aug_. 9, 1847.--I remained at Venice near a week after yourdeparture, to get strong and tranquil again. Saw all the pictures,if not enough, yet pretty well. My journey here was very profitable.Vicenza, Verona, Mantua, I saw really well, and much there is to see.Certainly I had learned more than ever in any previous ten days of myexistence, and have formed an idea of what is needed for the study ofart in these regions. But, at Brescia, I was taken ill with fever.I cannot tell you how much I was alarmed when it seemed to me itwas affecting my head. I had no medicine; nothing could I do exceptabstain entirely from food, and drink cold water. The second day, Ihad a bed made in a carriage, and came on here. I am now pretty well,only very weak.TO R.W.E._Milan, Aug. 10, 1847._--Since writing you from Florence, I havepassed the mountains; two full, rich days at Bologna; one at Ravenna;more than a fortnight at Venice, intoxicated with the place, and withVenetian art, only to be really felt and known in its birth-place.I have passed some hours at Vicenza, seeing mainly the Palladianstructures; a day at Verona,--a week had been better; seen Mantua,with great delight; several days in Lago di Garda,--truly happydays there; then, to Brescia, where I saw the Titians, the exquisiteRaphael, the Scavi, and the Brescian Hills. I could charm you bypictures, had I time.To-day, for the first time, I have seen Manzoni. Manzoni has spiritualefficacy in his looks; his eyes glow still with delicate tenderness,as when he first saw Lucia, or felt them fill at the image of FatherCristoforo. His manners are very engaging, frank, expansive; everyword betokens the habitual elevation of his thoughts; and (what youcare for so much) he says distinct, good things; but you must notexpect me to note them down. He lives in the house of his fathers, inthe simplest manner. He has taken the liberty to marry a new wife forhis own pleasure and companionship, and the people around him do notlike it, because she does not, to their fancy, make a good pendant tohim. But I liked her very well, and saw why he married her. They askedme to return often, if I pleased, and I mean to go once or twice, forManzoni seems to like to talk with me.       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, Oct., 1847._--Leaving Milan, I went on the Lago Maggiore, andafterward into Switzerland. Of this tour I shall not speak here; itwas a little romance by itself.Returning from Switzerland, I passed a fortnight on the Lake ofComo, and afterward visited Lugano. There is no exaggeration in theenthusiastic feeling with which artists and poets have viewed theseItalian lakes. The _"Titan"_ of Richter, the _"Wanderjahre"_ ofGoethe, the Elena of Taylor, the pictures of Turner, had not preparedme for the visions of beauty that daily entranced the eyes and heartin those regions. To our country, Nature has been most bounteous, butwe have nothing in the same class that can compare with these lakes,as seen under the Italian heaven. As to those persons who havepretended to discover that the effects of light and atmosphere wereno finer than they found in our own lake scenery, I can only saythat they must be exceedingly obtuse in organization,--a defect notuncommon among Americans.Nature seems to have labored to express her full heart in as many waysas possible, when she made these lakes, moulded and planted theirshores. Lago Maggiore is grandiose, resplendent in its beauty; theview of the Alps gives a sort of lyric exaltation to the scene. Lagodi Garda is so soft and fair on one side,--the ruins of ancientpalaces rise softly with the beauties of that shore; but at the otherend, amid the Tyrol, it is so sublime, so calm, so concentrated in itsmeaning! Como cannot be better described in generals than in the wordsof Taylor:--"Softly sublime, profusely fair"Lugano is more savage, more free in its beauty. I was on it in a highgale; there was little danger, just enough to exhilarate; its waterswild, and clouds blowing across its peaks. I like the boatmen on theselakes; they have strong and prompt character; of simple features,they are more honest and manly than Italian men are found in thethoroughfares; their talk is not so witty as that of the Venetiangondoliers, but picturesque, and what the French call _incisive._ Verytouching were some of their histories, as they told them to me, whilepausing sometimes on the lake. Grossi gives a true picture of sucha man in his family relations; the story may be found in "MarcoVisconti."On this lake, I met Lady Franklin, wife of the celebrated navigator.She has been in the United States, and showed equal penetration andcandor in remarks on what she had seen there. She gave me interestingparticulars as to the state of things in Van Diemen's Land, where shepassed seven years, when her husband was in authority there.TO C.S._Lake of Como, Aug_. 22, 1847.--Rome was much poisoned to me. But,after a time, its genius triumphed, and I became absorbed in itsproper life. Again I suffered from parting, and have since resolved toreturn, and pass at least a part of the winter there. People may writeand prate as they please of Rome, they cannot convey thus a portion ofits spirit. The whole heart must be yielded up to it. It is somethingreally transcendent, both spirit and body. Those last glorious nights,in which I wandered about amid the old walls and columns, or sat bythe fountains in the Piazza del Popolo, or by the river, were worth anage of pain,--only one hates pain in Italy.Tuscany I did not like as well. It is a great place to study thehistory of character and art. Indeed, there I did really begin tostudy, as well as gaze and feel. But I did not like it. Florence ismore in its spirit like Boston, than like an Italian city. I knewa good many Italians, but they were busy and intellectual, not likethose I had known before. But Florence is full of really good, greatpictures. There first I saw some of the great masters. Andrea delSarto, in particular, one sees only there, and he is worth much. Hiswife, whom he always paints, and for whom he was so infatuated, hassome bad qualities, and in what is good a certain wild nature or_diablerie_.Bologna is truly an Italian city, one in which I should like to live;full of hidden things, and its wonders of art are very grand. TheCaracci and their friends had vast force; not much depth, but enoughforce to occupy one a good while,--and Domenichino, when good at all,is very great.Venice was a dream of enchantment; _there_ was no disappointment.Art and life are one. There is one glow of joy, one deep shade ofpassionate melancholy; Giorgione, as a man, I care more for now thanany of the artists, though he had no ideas.In the first week, floating about in a gondola, I seemed to findmyself again.I was not always alone in Venice, but have come through the fertileplains of Lombardy, seen the lakes Garda and Maggiore, and a part ofSwitzerland, alone, except for occasional episodes of companionship,sometimes romantic enough.In Milan I stayed a while, and knew some radicals, young, andinterested in ideas. Here, on the lake, I have fallen into contactwith some of the higher society,--duchesses, marquises, and the like.My friend here is Madame Arconati, Marchioness Visconti. I haveformed connection with a fair and brilliant Polish lady, born PrincessRadzivill. It is rather pleasant to come a little on the traces ofthese famous histories; also, both these ladies take pleasure intelling me of spheres so unlike mine, and do it well.The life here on the lake is precisely what we once imagined as beingso pleasant. These people have charming villas and gardens on thelake, adorned with fine works of art. They go to see one another inboats. You can be all the time in a boat, if you like; if you wantmore excitement, or wild flowers, you climb the mountains. I have beenhere for some time, and shall stay a week longer. I have found softrepose here. Now, I am to return to Rome, seeing many things by theway.TO R.F.F._Florence, Sept_. 25, 1847.--I hope not to want a further remittancefor a long time. I shall not, if I can settle myself at Rome so asto avoid spoliation. That is very difficult in this country. I havesuffered from it already. The haste, the fatigue, the frequent illnessin travelling, have tormented me. At Rome I shall settle myself forfive months, and make arrangements to the best of my judgment, andwith counsel of experienced friends, and have some hope of economywhile there; but am not sure, as much more vigilance than I canpromise is needed against the treachery of servants and the cunning oflandlords.You are disappointed by my letter from Rome. But I did not feel equalthen to speaking of the things of Rome, and shall not, till betteracquaintance has steadied my mind. It is a matter of conscience withme not to make use of crude impressions, and what they call here"coffee-house intelligence," as travellers generally do. I preferskimming over the surface of things, till I feel solidly ready towrite.Milan I left with great regret, and hope to return. I knew there acircle of the aspiring youth, such as I have not in any other city.I formed many friendships, and learned a great deal. One of the youngmen, Guerrieri by name, (and of the famous Gonzaga family,) I reallylove. He has a noble soul, the quietest sensibility, and a brilliantand ardent, though not a great, mind. He is eight-and-twenty. Afterstudying medicine for the culture, he has taken law as his profession.His mind and that of Hicks, an artist of our country now here, alittle younger, are two that would interest you greatly. Guerrierispeaks no English; I speak French now as fluently as English, butincorrectly. To make use of it, I ought to have learned it earlier.Arriving here, Mr. Mozier, an American, who from a prosperous merchanthas turned sculptor, come hither to live, and promises much excellencein his profession, urged me so much to his house, that I came. Atfirst, I was ill from fatigue, and staid several days in bed; but hiswife took tender care of me, and the quiet of their house and regularsimple diet have restored me. As soon as I have seen a few thingshere, I shall go to Rome. On my way, I stopped at Parma,--saw theworks of Correggio and Parmegiano. I have now seen what Italy containsmost important of the great past; I begin to hope for her also agreat future,--the signs have improved so much since I came. I am mostfortunate to be here at this time.Interrupted, as always. How happy I should be if my abode at Romewould allow some chance for tranquil and continuous effort. But I darenot hope much, from the difficulty of making any domestic arrangementsthat can be relied on. The fruit of the moment is so precious, that Imust not complain. I learn much; but to do anything with what I learnis, under such circumstances, impossible. Besides, I am in great needof repose; I am almost inert from fatigue of body and spirit.TO E.H._Florence, Sept.,_ 1847.--I cannot even begin to speak of themagnificent scenes of nature, nor the works of art, that have raisedand filled my mind since I wrote from Naples. Now I begin to be inItaly! but I wish to drink deep of this cup before I speak my enamoredwords. Enough to say, Italy receives me as a long-lost child, and Ifeel myself at home here, and if I ever tell anything about it, youwill hear something real and domestic. Among strangers I wish most tospeak to you of my friend the Marchioness A. Visconti, a Milanese. Sheis a specimen of the really high-bred lady, such as I have not known.Without any physical beauty, the grace and harmony of her mannersproduce all the impression of beauty. She has also a mind strong,clear, precise, and much cultivated. She has a modest nobleness thatyou would dearly love. She is intimate with many of the first men. Sheseems to love me much, and to wish I should have whatever is hers. Itake great pleasure in her friendship.TO R.W.E._Rome, Oct_. 28, 1847.--I am happily settled for the winter, quite bymyself, in a neat, tranquil apartment in the Corso, where I see allthe motions of Rome,--in a house of loving Italians, who treat mewell, and do not interrupt me, except for service. I live alone, eatalone, walk alone, and enjoy unspeakably the stillness, after all therush and excitement of the past year.I shall make no acquaintance from whom I do not hope a good deal,as my time will be like pure gold to me this winter; and, just forhappiness, Rome itself is sufficient.To-day is the last of the October feasts of the Trasteverini. I havebeen, this afternoon, to see them dancing. This morning I was out,with half Rome, to see the Civic Guard manoeuvring in that great fieldnear the tomb of Cecilia Metella, which is full of ruins. The effectwas noble, as the band played the Bolognese march, and six thousandRomans passed in battle array amid these fragments of the great time.TO R.F.F._Rome, Oct_. 29, 1847.--I am trying to economize,--anxious to keepthe Roman expenses for six months within the limits of four hundreddollars. Rome is not as cheap a place as Florence, but then I wouldnot give a pin to live in Florence.We have just had glorious times with the October feasts, when all theRoman people were out. I am now truly happy here, quiet and familiar;no longer a staring, sight-seeing stranger, riding about finelydressed in a coach to see muses and sibyls. I see these forms now inthe natural manner, and am contented.Keep free from false ties; they are the curse of life. I find myselfso happy here, alone and free.TO M.S._Rome, Oct_. 1847.--I arrived in Rome again nearly a fortnight ago,and all mean things were forgotten in the joy that rushed over me likea flood. Now I saw the true Rome. I came with no false expectations,and I came to live in tranquil companionship, not in the restlessimpertinence of sight-seeing, so much more painful here than anywhereelse.I had made a good visit to Vicenza; a truly Italian town, with much tosee and study. But all other places faded away, now that I again sawSt. Peter's, and heard the music of the fountains.The Italian autumn is not as beautiful as I expected, neither in thevintage of Tuscany nor here. The country is really sere and brown; butthe weather is fine, and these October feasts are charming. Two days Ihave been at the Villa Borghese. There are races, balloons, and, aboveall, the private gardens open, and good music on the little lake.TO ----._Rome, morning of the 17th Nov_., 1847.--It seems great folly to sendthe enclosed letter. I have written it in my nightly fever. All dayI dissipate my thoughts on outward beauty. I have many thoughts,happiest moments, but as yet I do not have even this part in acongenial way. I go about in a coach with several people; but Englishand Americans are not at home here. Since I have experienced thedifferent atmosphere of the European mind, and been allied with it,nay, mingled in the bonds of love, I suffer more than ever from thatwhich is peculiarly American or English. I should like to cease fromhearing the language for a time. Perhaps I should return to it; butat present I am in a state of unnatural divorce from what I was mostallied to.There is a Polish countess here, who likes me much. She has been veryhandsome, still is, in the style of the full-blown rose. She is awidow, very rich, one of the emancipated women, naturally vivacious,and with talent. This woman _envies me_; she says, "How happy you are;so free, so serene, so attractive, so self-possessed!" I say not aword, but I do not look on myself as particularly enviable. A littlemoney would have made me much more so; a little money would haveenabled me to come here long ago, and find those that belong to me, orat least try my experiments; then my health would never have sunk, northe best years of my life been wasted in useless friction. Had I moneynow,--could I only remain, take a faithful servant, and live alone,and still see those I love when it is best, that would suit me. Itseems to me, very soon I shall be calmed, and begin to enjoy.TO HER MOTHER._Rome, Dec_. 16, 1847.--My life at Rome is thus far all I hoped.I have not been so well since I was a child, nor so happy ever, asduring the last six weeks. I wrote you about my home; it continuesgood, perfectly clean, food wholesome, service exact. For all this Ipay, but not immoderately. I think the sum total of my expenses here,for six months, will not exceed four hundred and fifty dollars.My _marchesa_, of whom I rent my rooms, is the greatest liar I everknew, and the most interested, heartless creature. But she thinks itfor her interest to please me, as she sees I have a good many personswho value me; and I have been able, without offending her, to make itunderstood that I do not wish her society. Thus I remain undisturbed.Every Monday evening, I receive my acquaintance. I give norefreshment, but only light the saloon, and decorate it with freshflowers, of which I have plenty still. How I wish _you_ could seethem!Among the frequent guests are known to you Mr. and Mrs. Cranch, Mr.and Mrs. Story. Mr. S. has finally given up law, for the artist'slife. His plans are not matured, but he passes the winter at Rome.On other evenings, I do not receive company, unless by appointment. Ispend them chiefly in writing or study. I have now around me the booksI need to know Italy and Rome. I study with delight, now that I canverify everything. The days are invariably fine, and each day I am outfrom eleven till five, exploring some new object of interest, often ata great distance.TO R.W.E._Rome, Dec_. 20, 1847.--Nothing less than two or three years, freefrom care and forced labor, would heal all my hurts, and renew mylife-blood at its source. Since Destiny will not grant me that, I hopeshe will not leave me long in the world, for I am tired of keepingmyself up in the water without corks, and without strength to swim.I should like to go to sleep, and be born again into a state where myyoung life should not be prematurely taxed.Italy has been glorious to me, and there have been hours in which Ireceived the full benefit of the vision. In Rome, I have known someblessed, quiet days, when I could yield myself to be soothed andinstructed by the great thoughts and memories of the place. But thosedays are swiftly passing. Soon I must begin to exert myself, forthere is this incubus of the future, and none to help me, if I am notprudent to face it. So ridiculous, too, this mortal coil,--such smallthings!I find how true was the lure that always drew me towards Europe. Itwas no false instinct that said I might here find an atmosphere todevelop me in ways I need. Had I only come ten years earlier! Nowmy life must be a failure, so much strength has been wasted onabstractions, which only came because I grew not in the right soil.However, it is a less failure than with most others, and not worththinking twice about. Heaven has room enough, and good chances instore, and I can live a great deal in the years that remain.TO R.W.E._Rome, Dec_. 20, 1847.--I don't know whether you take an interest inthe present state of things in Italy, but you would if you werehere. It is a fine time to see the people. As to the Pope, it is asdifficult here as elsewhere to put new wine into old bottles, andthere is something false as well as ludicrous in the spectacle of thepeople first driving their princes to do a little justice, and then_evviva-ing_ them at such a rate. This does not apply to the Pope; heis a real great heart, a generous man. The love for him is genuine,and I like to be within its influence. It was his heart that gave theimpulse, and this people has shown, to the shame of English and otherprejudice, how unspoiled they were at the core, how open, nay, howwondrous swift to answer a generous appeal!They are also gaining some education by the present freedom of thepress and of discussion. I should like to write a letter for England,giving my view of the present position of things here.       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, October_ 18, 1847.--In the spring, when I came to Rome, thepeople were in the intoxication of joy at the first serious measuresof reform taken by the Pope. I saw with pleasure their childlike joyand trust. Still doubts were always present whether this joy was notpremature. From the people themselves the help must come, and notfrom the princes. Rome, to resume her glory, must cease to be anecclesiastical capital. Whilst I sympathized with the warm love of thepeople, the adulation of leading writers, who were willing to takeall from the prince of the Church as a gift and a bounty, insteadof steadily implying that it was the right of the people, was veryrepulsive to me. Passing into Tuscany, I found the liberty of thepress just established. The Grand Duke, a well-intentioned, thoughdull, man, had dared to declare himself an Italian prince. I arrivedin Florence too late for the great fete of the 12th September,in honor of the grant of the National Guard, but the day was madememorable by the most generous feeling on all sides. Some days beforewere passed by reconciling all strifes, composing all differencesbetween cities, districts, and individuals. On that day they allembraced in sign of this; exchanged banners as a token that they wouldfight for one another.AMERICANS IN ITALY.The Americans took their share in this occasion, and Greenough,--oneof the few Americans who, living in Italy, takes the pains to knowwhether it is alive or dead, who penetrates beyond the cheats oftradesmen, and the cunning of a mob corrupted by centuries of slavery,to know the real mind, the vital blood of Italy,--took a leading part.I am sorry to say that a large portion of my countrymen here takethe same slothful and prejudiced view as the English, and, after manyyears' sojourn, betray entire ignorance of Italian literature andItalian life beyond what is attainable in a month's passage throughthe thoroughfares. However, they did show, this time, a becomingspirit, and erected the American Eagle where its cry ought to be heardfrom afar. Crawford, here in Rome, has had the just feeling to jointhe Guard, and it is a real sacrifice for an artist to spend timeon the exercises; but it well becomes the sculptor of Orpheus. Inreference to what I have said of many Americans in Italy, I will onlyadd that they talk about the corrupt and degenerate state of Italy asthey do about that of our slaves at home. They come ready trained tothat mode of reasoning which affirms, that, because men are degradedby bad institutions, they are not fit for better. I will only addsome words upon the happy augury I draw from the wise docility ofthe people. With what readiness they listened to wise counsel and thehopes of the Pope that they would give no advantage to his enemies ata time when they were so fevered by the knowledge that conspiracywas at work in their midst! That was a time of trial. On all theseoccasions of popular excitement their conduct is like music, in suchorder, and with such union of the melody of feeling with discretionwhere to stop; but what is wonderful is that they acted in the samemanner on that difficult occasion. The influence of the Pope here iswithout bounds; he can always calm the crowd at once. But in Tuscany,where they have no such one idol, they listened in the same way on avery trying occasion. The first announcement of the regulation for theTuscan National Guard terribly disappointed the people. They felt thatthe Grand Duke, after suffering them to demonstrate such trust and joyon this feast of the 12th, did not really trust, on his side; that hemeant to limit them all he could; they felt baffled, cheated; henceyoung men in anger tore down at once the symbols of satisfaction andrespect; but the leading men went among the people, begged them to becalm, and wait till a deputation had seen the Grand Duke. The peoplelistened at once to men who, they were sure, had at heart their bestgood--waited; the Grand Duke became convinced, and all ended withoutdisturbance. If the people continue to act thus, their hopes cannot bebaffled.The American in Europe would fain encourage the hearts of theselong-oppressed nations, now daring to hope for a new era, by recitingtriumphant testimony from the experience of his own country. But wemust stammer and blush when we speak of many things. I take pridehere, that I may really say the liberty of the press works well, andthat checks and balances naturally evolve from it, which suffice toits government. I may say, that the minds of our people are alert,and that talent has a free chance to rise. It is much. But dare Isay, that political ambition is not as darkly sullied as in othercountries? Dare I say, that men of most influence in political lifeare those who represent most virtue, or even intellectual power? CanI say, our social laws are generally better, or show a nobler insightinto the wants of man and woman? I do indeed say what I believe, thatvoluntary association for improvement in these particulars will be thegrand means for my nation to grow, and give a nobler harmony to thecoming age. Then there is this cancer of slavery, and this wicked warthat has grown out of it. How dare I speak of these things here? Ilisten to the same arguments against the emancipation of Italy, thatare used against the emancipation of our blacks; the same arguments infavor of the spoliation of Poland, as for the conquest of Mexico.How it pleases me here to think of the Abolitionists! I could neverendure to be with them at home; they were so tedious, often so narrow,always so rabid and exaggerated in their tone. But, after all, theyhad a high motive, something eternal in their desire and life; and, ifit was not the only thing worth thinking of, it was really somethingworth living and dying for, to free a great nation from such a blot,such a plague. God strengthen them, and make them wise to achievetheir purpose!I please myself, too, with remembering some ardent souls among theAmerican youth, who, I trust, will yet expand and help to give soul tothe huge, over-fed, too-hastily-grown-up body. May they be constant!"Were man but constant, he were perfect." It is to the youth that Hopeaddresses itself. But I dare not expect too much of them. I am notvery old; yet of those who, in life's morning, I saw touched bythe light of a high hope, many have seceded. Some have becomevoluptuaries; some mere family men, who think it is quite life enoughto win bread for half a dozen people, and treat them decently; othersare lost through indolence and vacillation. Yet some remain constant.  "I have witnessed many a shipwreck, yet still beat noble hearts."       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, January, 1848_.--As one becomes domesticated here, ancient andmodern Rome, at first so jumbled together, begin to separate. You seewhere objects and limits anciently were. When this happens, one feelsfirst truly at ease in Rome. Then the old kings, the consuls, thetribunes, the emperors, the warriors of eagle sight and remorselessbeak, return for us, and the toga-clad procession finds room to sweepacross the scene; the seven hills tower, the innumerable templesglitter, and the Via Sacra swarms with triumphal life once more.       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, Jan. 12, 1848._--In Rome, here, the new Council is inaugurated,and the elections have given tolerable satisfaction. Twenty-fourcarriages had been lent by the princes and nobles, at the request ofthe city, to convey the councillors. Each deputy was followed byhis target and banner. In the evening, there was a ball given at theArgentine. Lord Minto was there, Prince Corsini, now senator, theTorlonias, in uniform of the Civic Guard, Princess Torlonia, in asash of their colors given her by the Civic Guard, which she waved inanswer to their greetings. But the beautiful show of the evening wasthe _Trasteverini_ dancing the _Saltarello_ in their most beautifulcostume. I saw them thus to much greater advantage than ever before.Several were nobly handsome, and danced admirably. The _saltarello_enchants me; in this is really the Italian wine, the Italian sun.The Pope, in receiving the councillors, made a speech, intimating thathe meant only to improve, not to _reform_ and should keep things safelocked with the keys of St. Peter.I was happy the first two months of my stay here, seeing all the greatthings at my leisure. But now, after a month of continuous rain, Romeis no more Rome. The atmosphere is far worse than that of Paris. Itis impossible to walk in the thick mud. The ruins, and other greatobjects, always solemn, appear terribly gloomy, steeped in black rainand cloud; and my apartment, in a street of high houses, is dark allday. The bad weather may continue all this month and all next. If Icould use the time for work, I should not care; but this climate makesme so ill, I can do but little.TO C.S._Rome, Jan_. 12, 1848.--My time in Lombardy and Switzerland was aseries of beautiful pictures, dramatic episodes, not without someoriginal life in myself. When I wrote to you from Como, I had apeaceful season. I floated on the lake with my graceful Polishcountess, hearing her stories of heroic sorrow; or I walked in thedelicious gardens of the villas, with many another summer friend. Redbanners floated, children sang and shouted, the lakes of Venus andDiana glittered in the sun. The pretty girls of Bellaggio, with theircoral necklaces, brought flowers to the "American countess," and"hoped she would be as happy as she deserved." Whether this cautiouswish is fulfilled, I know not, but certainly I left all the glitter oflife behind at Como.My days at Milan were not unmarked. I have known some happy hours, butthey all lead to sorrow; and not only the cups of wine, but of milk,seem drugged with poison for me. It does not _seem_ to be my fault,this Destiny; I do not court these things,--they come. I am a poormagnet, with power to be wounded by the bodies I attract.Leaving Milan, I had a brilliant day in Parma. I had not knownCorreggio before; he deserves all his fame. I stood in the parlorof the Abbess, the person for whom all was done, and Paradise seemedopened by the nymph, upon her car of light, and the divine childrenpeeping through the vines. Sweet soul of love! I should weary of you,too; but it was glorious that day.I had another good day, too, crossing the Apennines. The youngcrescent moon rose in orange twilight, just as I reached the highestpeak. I was alone on foot; I heard no sound; I prayed.At Florence, I was very ill. For three weeks, my life hung upona thread. The effect of the Italian climate on my health is notfavorable. I feel as if I had received a great injury. I am tiredand woe-worn; often, in the bed, I wish I could weep my life away.However, they brought me gruel, I took it, and after a while rose upagain. In the time of the vintage, I went alone to Sienna. This is areal untouched Italian place. This excursion, and the grapes, restoredme at that time.When I arrived in Rome, I was at first intoxicated to be here. Theweather was beautiful, and many circumstances combined to place me ina kind of passive, childlike well-being. That is all over now, and,with this year, I enter upon a sphere of my destiny so difficult, thatI, at present, see no way out, except through the gate of death. Itis useless to write of it; you are at a distance and cannot helpme;--whether accident or angel will, I have no intimation. I have noreason to hope I shall not reap what I have sown, and do not. Yet howI shall endure it I cannot guess; it is all a dark, sad enigma. Thebeautiful forms of art charm no more, and a love, in which there isall fondness, but no help, flatters in vain. I am all alone; nobodyaround me sees any of this. My numerous friendly acquaintances aretroubled if they see me ill, and who so affectionate and kind as Mr.and Mrs. S.?TO MADAME ARCONATI._Rome, Jan_. 14, 1848.--What black and foolish calumnies are theseon Mazzini! It is as much for his interest as his honor to let thingstake their course, at present. To expect anything else, is to supposehim base. And on what act of his life dares any one found such aninsinuation? I do not wonder that you were annoyed at his mannerof addressing the Pope; but to me it seems that he speaks as heshould,--near God and beyond the tomb; not from power to power, butfrom soul to soul, without regard to temporal dignities. It must beadmitted that the etiquette, Most Holy Father, &c., jars with this.TO R.W.E._Rome, March_ 14, 1848.--Mickiewicz is with me here, and will remainsome time; it was he I wanted to see, more than any other person, ingoing back to Paris, and I have him much better here. France itselfI should like to see, but remain undecided, on account of my health,which has suffered so much, this winter, that I must make it thefirst object in moving for the summer. One physician thinks it will ofitself revive, when once the rains have passed, which have now lastedfrom 16th December to this day. At present, I am not able to leave thefire, or exert myself at all.       *       *       *       *       *In all the descriptions of the Roman Carnival, the fact has beenomitted of daily rain. I felt, indeed, ashamed to perceive it, when noone else seemed to, whilst the open windows caused me convulsive coughand headache. The carriages, with their cargoes of happy women dressedin their ball dresses and costumes, drove up and down, even in thepouring rain. The two handsome _contadine_, who serve me, took offtheir woollen gowns, and sat five hours at a time, in the street, inwhite cambric dresses, and straw hats turned up with roses. I neversaw anything like the merry good-humor of these people. I shouldalways be ashamed to complain of anything here. But I had alwayslooked forward to the Roman Carnival as a time when I could play too;and it even surpassed my expectations, with its exuberant gayety andinnocent frolic, but I was unable to take much part. The others threwflowers all day, and went to masked balls all night; but I went outonly once, in a carriage, and was more exhausted with the storm offlowers and sweet looks than I could be by a storm of hail. I wentto the German Artists' ball, where were some pretty costumes, andbeautiful music; and to the Italian masked ball, where interest liesin intrigue.I have scarcely gone to the galleries, damp and cold as tombs; or tothe mouldy old splendor of churches, where, by the way, they arejust wailing over the theft of St. Andrew's head, for the sake ofthe jewels. It is quite a new era for this population to plunder thechurches; but they are suffering terribly, and Pio's municipalitydoes, as yet, nothing.TO W.H.C._Rome, March 29, 1848._--I have been engrossed, stunned almost, by thepublic events that have succeeded one another with such rapidityand grandeur. It is a time such as I always dreamed of, and for longsecretly hoped to see. I rejoice to be in Europe at this time, andshall return possessed of a great history. Perhaps I shall be calledto act. At present, I know not where to go, what to do. War iseverywhere. I cannot leave Rome, and the men of Rome are marching outevery day into Lombardy. The citadel of Milan is in the hands of myfriends, Guerriere, &c., but there may be need to spill much blood yetin Italy. France and Germany are riot in such a state that I can gothere now. A glorious flame burns higher and higher in the heart ofthe nations.       *       *       *       *       *The rain was constant through the Roman winter, falling in torrentsfrom 16th December to 19th March. Now the Italian heavens wear againtheir deep blue, the sun is glorious, the melancholy lustres arestealing again over the Campagna, and hundreds of larks sing unweariedabove its ruins. Nature seems in sympathy with the great events thatare transpiring. How much has happened since I wrote!--the resistanceof Sicily, and the revolution of Naples; now the fall of LouisPhilippe; and Metternich is crushed in Austria. I saw the Austrianarms dragged through the streets here, and burned in the Piazza delPopolo. The Italians embraced one another, and cried, _miracolo,Providenza!_ the Tribune Ciccronachio fed the flame with fagots; AdamMickiewicz, the great poet of Poland, long exiled from his country,looked on; while Polish women brought little pieces that hadbeen scattered in the street, and threw into the flames. When thedouble-headed eagle was pulled down from the lofty portal of thePalazzo di Venezia, the people placed there, in its stead, one ofwhite and gold, inscribed with the name, ALTA ITALIA; and instantlythe news followed, that Milan, Venice, Modena, and Parma, were drivingout their tyrants. These news were received in Rome with indescribablerapture. Men danced, and women wept with joy along the street. Theyouths rushed to enrol themselves in regiments to go to the frontier.In the Colosseum, their names were received.       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, April 1, 1848._-Yesterday, on returning from Ostia, I find theofficial news, that the Viceroy Ranieri has capitulated at Verona;that Italy is free, independent, and one. I trust this will prove noApril foolery. It seems too good, too speedy a realization of hope.       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, April 30, 1848._--It is a time such as I always dreamed of; andthat fire burns in the hearts of men around me which can keep me warm.Have I something to do here? or am I only to cheer on the warriors,and after write the history of their deeds? The first is all I havedone yet, but many have blessed me for my sympathy, and blest me bythe action it impelled.My private fortunes are dark and tangled; my strength to govern them(perhaps that I am enervated by this climate) much diminished. I havethrown myself on God, and perhaps he will make my temporal state verytragical. I am more of a child than ever, and hate suffering more thanever, but suppose I shall live with it, if it must come.I did not get your letter, about having the rosary blessed for ----,before I left Rome, and now, I suppose, she would not wish it, as nonecan now attach any value to the blessing of Pius IX. Those who lovedhim can no longer defend him. It has become obvious, that thosefirst acts of his in the papacy were merely the result of a kindly,good-natured temperament; that he had not thought to understand theirbearing, nor force to abide by it. He seems quite destitute of moralcourage. He is not resolute either on the wrong or right side. First,he abandoned the liberal party; then, yielding to the will of thepeople, and uniting, in appearance, with a liberal ministry, he letthe cardinals betray it, and defeat the hopes of Italy. He criedpeace, peace! but had not a word of blame for the sanguinary acts ofthe King of Naples, a word of sympathy for the victims of Lombardy.Seizing the moment of dejection in the nation, he put in thisretrograde ministry; sanctioned their acts, daily more impudent: letthem neutralize the constitution he himself had given; and when thepeople slew his minister, and assaulted him in his own palace, heyielded anew; he dared not die, or even run the slight risk,--foronly by accident could he have perished. His person as a Pope is stillrespected, though his character as a man is despised. All the peoplecompare him with Pius VII. saying to the French, "Slay me if you will;I _cannot_ yield," and feel the difference.I was on Monte Cavallo yesterday. The common people were staring atthe broken windows and burnt door of the palace where they have sooften gone to receive a blessing, the children playing, "_SediaPapale. Morte ai Cardinali, e morte al Papa!_"The men of straw are going down in Italy everywhere; the real menrising into power. Montanelli, Guerazzi, Mazzini, are real men; theirinfluence is of character. Had we only been born a little later!Mazzini has returned from his seventeen years' exile, "to see what heforesaw." He has a mind far in advance of his times, and yet Mazzinisees not all.       *       *       *       *       *_Rome, May_ 7, 1848.--Good and loving hearts will be unprepared, andfor a time must suffer much from the final dereliction of Pius IX.to the cause of freedom. After the revolution opened in Lombardy,the troops of the line were sent thither; the volunteers rushed toaccompany them, the priests preached the war as a crusade, the Popeblessed the banners. The report that the Austrians had taken andhung as a brigand one of the Roman Civic Guard,--a well-known artistengaged in the war of Lombardy,--roused the people; and they went tothe Pope, to demand that he should declare war against the Austrians.The Pope summoned a consistory, and then declared in his speech thathe had only intended local reforms; that he regretted the misusethat had been made of his name; and wound up by lamenting the waras offensive to the spirit of religion. A momentary stupefaction,followed by a passion of indignation, in which the words _traitor_ and_imbecile_ were heard, received this astounding speech. The Pope wasbesieged with deputations, and, after two days' struggle, was obligedto place the power in the hands of persons most opposed to him, andnominally acquiesce in their proceedings.TO R.W.E. (_in London_)._Rome, May 19, 1848._--I should like to return with you, but I havemuch to do and learn in Europe yet. I am deeply interested in thispublic drama, and wish to see it _played out_. Methinks I have _mypart_ therein, either as actor or historian.I cannot marvel at your readiness to close the book of Europeansociety. The shifting scenes entertain poorly. The flux of thought andfeeling leaves some fertilizing soil; but for me, few indeed are thepersons I should wish to see again; nor do I care to push the inquiryfurther. The simplest and most retired life would now please me, onlyI would not like to be confined to it, in case I grew weary, andnow and then craved variety, for exhilaration. I want some scenesof natural beauty, and, imperfect as love is, I want human beings tolove, as I suffocate without. For intellectual stimulus, books wouldmainly supply it, when wanted.Why did you not try to be in Paris at the opening of the Assembly?There were elements worth scanning.TO R.F.F._Rome, May 20, 1848._--My health is much revived by the spring here,as gloriously beautiful as the winter was dreary. We know nothingof spring in our country. Here the soft and brilliant weather isunbroken, except now and then by a copious shower, which keepseverything fresh. The trees, the flowers, the bird-songs are inperfection. I have enjoyed greatly my walks in the villas, where thegrounds are of three or four miles in extent, and like free nature inthe wood-glades and still paths; while they have an added charm in themusic of their many fountains, and the soft gleam, here and there, ofsarcophagus or pillar.I have been a few days at Albano, and explored its beautiful environsalone, to much greater advantage than I could last year, in thecarriage with my friends.I went, also, to Frascati and Ostia, with an English family, who hada good carriage, and were kindly, intelligent people, who could notdisturb the Roman landscape.Now I am going into the country, where I can live very cheaply, evenkeeping a servant of my own, without which guard I should not venturealone into the unknown and wilder regions.I have been so disconcerted by my Roman winter, that I dare not plandecisively again. The enervating breath of Rome paralyzes my body, butI know and love her. The expression, "City of the Soul," designatesher, and her alone.TO MADAME ARCONATI._Rome, May 27, 1848._--This is my last day at Rome. I have beenpassing several days at Subiaco and Tivoli, and return again to thecountry to-morrow. These scenes of natural beauty have filled myheart, and increased, if possible, my desire that the people who havethis rich inheritance may no longer be deprived of its benefits by badinstitutions.The people of Subiaco are poor, though very industrious, andcultivating every inch of ground, with even English care andneatness;--so ignorant and uncultivated, while so finely and stronglymade by Nature. May God grant now, to this people, what they need!An illumination took place last night, in honor of the "IllustriousGioberti." He is received here with great triumph, his carriagefollowed with shouts of "_Viva Gioberti, morte ai Jesuiti!_" whichmust be pain to the many Jesuits, who, it is said, still lingerhere in disguise. His triumphs are shared by Mamiani and Orioli,self-trumpeted celebrities, self-constituted rulers of the Romanstates,--men of straw, to my mind, whom the fire already kindled willburn into a handful of ashes.I sit in my obscure corner, and watch the progress of events. It isthe position that pleases me best, and, I believe, the most favorableone. Everything confirms me in my radicalism; and, without any desireto hasten matters, indeed with surprise to see them rush so like atorrent, I seem to see them all tending to realize my own hopes.My health and spirits now much restored, I am beginning to set downsome of my impressions. I am going into the mountains, hoping there tofind pure, strengthening air, and tranquillity for so many days as toallow me to do something.TO R.F. F----._Rieti, July 1, 1848._--Italy is as beautiful as even I hoped, andI should wish to stay here several years, if I had a moderate fixedincome. One wants but little money here, and can have with it manyof the noblest enjoyments. I should have been very glad if fate wouldallow me a few years of congenial life, at the end of not a few ofstruggle and suffering. But I do not hope it; my fate will be the sameto the close,--beautiful gifts shown, and then withdrawn, or offeredon conditions that make acceptance impossible.TO MADAME ARCONATI._Corpus Domini, June_ 22, 1848.--I write such a great number ofletters, having not less than a hundred correspondents, that it seems,every day, as if I had just written to each. There is no one, surely,this side of the salt sea, with whom I wish more to keep up theinterchange of thought than with you.I believe, if you could know my heart as God knows it, and seethe causes that regulate my conduct, you would always love me. Butalready, in absence, I have lost, for the present, some of thosewho were dear to me, by failure of letters, or false report. Aftersorrowing much about a falsehood told me of a dearest friend, I foundhis letter at Torlonia's, which had been there ten months, and, dulyreceived, would have made all right. There is something fatal in mydestiny about correspondence.But I will say no more of this; only the loss of that letter to you,at such an unfortunate time,--just when I most wished to seem theloving and grateful friend I was,--made me fear it might be my destinyto lose you too. But if any cross event shall do me this ill turn onearth, we shall meet again in that clear state of intelligence whichmen call heaven.I see by the journals that you have not lost Montanelli. That noblemind is still spared to Italy. The Pope's heart is incapable oftreason; but he has fallen short of the office fate assigned him.I am no bigoted Republican, yet I think that form of government willeventually pervade the civilized world. Italy may not be ripe for ityet, but I doubt if she finds peace earlier; and this hasty annexationof Lombardy to the crown of Sardinia seems, to me, as well as I canjudge, an act unworthy and unwise. Base, indeed, the monarch, if itwas needed, and weak no less than base; for he was already too farengaged in the Italian cause to retire with honor or wisdom.I am here, in a lonely mountain home, writing the narrative of myEuropean experience. To this I devote great part of the day. Three orfour hours I pass in the open air, on donkey or on foot. When I haveexhausted this spot, perhaps I shall try another. Apply as I may, itwill take three months, at least, to finish my book. It grows upon me.TO R.W.E._Rieti, July_ 11, 1848.--Once I had resolution to face my difficultiesmyself, and try to give only what was pleasant to others; but now thatmy courage has fairly given way, and the fatigue of life is beyond mystrength, I do not prize myself, or expect others to prize me.Some years ago, I thought you very unjust, because you did not lendfull faith to my spiritual experiences; but I see you were quiteright. I thought I had tasted of the true elixir, and that the wantof daily bread, or the pangs of imprisonment, would never make me acomplaining beggar. A widow, I expected still to have the cruse fullfor others. Those were glorious hours, and angels certainly visitedme; but there must have been too much earth,--too much taint ofweakness and folly, so that baptism did not suffice. I know now thosesame things, but at present they are words, not living spells.I hear, at this moment, the clock of the Church del Purgatoriotelling noon in this mountain solitude. Snow yet lingers on thesemountain-tops, after forty days of hottest sunshine, last night brokenby a few clouds, prefatory to a thunder storm this morning. It hasbeen so hot here, that even the peasant in the field says, "_Non porropiu resistere_," and slumbers in the shade, rather than the sun. Ilove to see their patriarchal ways of guarding the sheep and tillingthe fields. They are a simple race. Remote from the corruptions offoreign travel, they do not ask for money, but smile upon and bless meas I pass,--for the Italians love me; they say I am so "_simpatica._"I never see any English or Americans, and now think wholly in Italian:only the surgeon who bled me, the other day, was proud to speak alittle French, which he had learned at Tunis! The ignorance of thispeople is amusing. I am to them a divine visitant,--an instructiveCeres,--telling them wonderful tales of foreign customs, and evenlegends of the lives of their own saints. They are people whom I couldlove and live with. Bread and grapes among them would suffice me.TO HER MOTHER._Rome, Nov_. 16, 1848.--* * * Of other circumstances which complicatemy position I cannot write. Were you here, I would confide in youfully, and have more than once, in the silence of the night, recitedto you those most strange and romantic chapters in the story of my sadlife. At one time when I thought I might die, I empowered a person,who has given me, as far as possible to him, the aid and sympathy ofa brother, to communicate them to you, on his return to the UnitedStates. But now I think we shall meet again, and I am sure you willalways love your daughter, and will know gladly that in all events shehas tried to aid and striven never to injure her fellows. In earlierdays, I dreamed of doing and being much, but now am content with theMagdalen to rest my plea hereon, "_She has loved much_."You, loved mother, keep me informed, as you have, of important facts,_especially_ the _worst_. The thought of you, the knowledge of yourangelic nature, is always one of my greatest supports. Happy those whohave such a mother! Myriad instances of selfishness and corruption ofheart cannot destroy the confidence in human nature.I am again in Rome, situated for the first time entirely to my mind.I have but one room, but large; and everything about the bed sogracefully and adroitly disposed that it makes a beautiful parlor, andof course I pay much less. I have the sun all day, and an excellentchimney. It is very high and has pure air, and the most beautiful viewall around imaginable. Add, that I am with the dearest, delightfulold couple one can imagine, quick, prompt, and kind, sensible andcontented. Having no children, they like to regard me and the Prussiansculptor, my neighbor, as such; yet are too delicate and too busy everto intrude. In the attic, dwells a priest, who insists on makingmy fire when Antonia is away. To be sure, he pays himself for histrouble, by asking a great many questions. The stories below areoccupied by a frightful Russian princess with moustaches, and afootman who ties her bonnet for her; and a fat English lady, with afine carriage, who gives all her money to the church, and has made forthe house a terrace of flowers that would delight you. Antonia hasher flowers in a humble balcony, her birds, and an immense blackcat; always addressed by both husband and wife as "Amoretto," (littlelove!)The house looks out on the Piazza Barberini, and I see both thatpalace and the Pope's. The scene to-day has been one of terribleinterest. The poor, weak Pope has fallen more and more under thedominion of the cardinals, till at last all truth was hidden from hiseyes. He had suffered the minister, Rossi, to go on, tightening thereins, and, because the people preserved a sullen silence, he thoughtthey would bear it. Yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies, illegallyprorogued, was opened anew. Rossi, after two or three most unpopularmeasures, had the imprudence to call the troops of the line to defendhim, instead of the National Guard. On the 14th, the Pope had investedhim with the privileges of a Roman citizen: (he had renounced hiscountry when an exile, and returned to it as ambassador of LouisPhilippe.) This position he enjoyed but one day. Yesterday, as hedescended from his carriage, to enter the Chamber, the crowdhowled and hissed; then pushed him, and, as he turned his head inconsequence, a sure hand stabbed him in the back. He said no word,but died almost instantly in the arms of a cardinal. The act wasundoubtedly the result of the combination of many, from the dexteritywith which it was accomplished, and the silence which ensued. Thosewho had not abetted beforehand seemed entirely to approve when done.The troops of the line, on whom he had relied, remained at theirposts, and looked coolly on. In the evening, they walked the streetswith the people, singing, "Happy the hand which rids the world of atyrant!" Had Rossi lived to enter the Chamber, he would have seen themost terrible and imposing mark of denunciation known in the historyof nations,--the whole house, without a single exception, seated onthe benches of opposition. The news of his death was received by thedeputies with the same cold silence as by the people. For me, I neverthought to have heard of a violent death with satisfaction, but thisact affected me as one of terrible justice.To-day, all the troops and the people united and went to the Quirinalto demand a change of measures. They found the Swiss Guard drawn out,and the Pope dared not show himself. They attempted to force the doorof his palace, to enter his presence, and the guard fired. I saw a manborne by wounded. The drum beat to call out the National Guard. Thecarriage of Prince Barberini has returned with its frightened inmatesand liveried retinue, and they have suddenly barred up the court-yardgate. Antonia, seeing it, observes, "Thank Heaven, we are poor, wehave nothing to fear!" This is the echo of a sentiment which will soonbe universal in Europe.Never feel any apprehensions for my safety from such causes. Thereare those who will protect me, if necessary, and, besides, I am on theconquering side. These events have, to me, the deepest interest. Thesedays are what I always longed for,--were I only free from privatecare! But, when the best and noblest want bread to give to the causeof liberty, I can just not demand _that_ of them; their blood theywould give me.You cannot conceive the enchantment of this place. So much I sufferedhere last January and February, I thought myself a little weaned; but,returning, my heart swelled even to tears with the cry of the poet:--  "O, Rome, _my_ country, city of the soul!"Those have not lived who have not seen Rome. Warned, however, by thelast winter, I dared not rent my lodgings for the year. I hope I amacclimated. I have been through what is called the grape-cure, muchmore charming, certainly, than the water-cure. At present I am verywell; but, alas! because I have gone to bed early, and done verylittle. I do not know if I can maintain any labor. As to my life, Ithink that it is not the will of Heaven it should terminate verysoon. I have had another strange escape. I had taken passage in thediligence to come to Rome; two rivers were to be passed,--the Turanoand the Tiber,--but passed by good bridges, and a road excellent whennot broken unexpectedly by torrents from the mountains. The diligencesets out between three and four in the morning, long before light.The director sent me word that the Marchioness Crispoldi had taken forherself and family a coach extraordinary, which would start twohours later, and that I could have a place in that, if I liked; so Iaccepted. The weather had been beautiful, but, on the eve of the dayfixed for my departure, the wind rose, and the rain fell in torrents.I observed that the river which passed my window was much swollen,and rushed with great violence. In the night, I heard its voice stillstronger, and felt glad I had not to set out in the dark. I rose withtwilight, and was expecting my carriage, and wondering at its delay,when I heard, that the great diligence, several miles below, hadbeen seized by a torrent; the horses were up to their necks in water,before any one dreamed of the danger. The postilion called on all thesaints, and threw himself into the water. The door of the diligencecould not be opened, and the passengers forced themselves, one afteranother, into the cold water,--dark too. Had I been there I had faredill; a pair of strong men were ill after it, though all escaped withlife.For several days, there was no going to Rome; but, at last, we setforth in two great diligences, with all the horses of the route. Formany miles, the mountains and ravines were covered with snow; I seemedto have returned to my own country and climate. Few miles passed,before the conductor injured his leg under the wheel, and I had thepain of seeing him suffer all the way, while "Blood of Jesus," "Soulsof Purgatory," was the mildest beginning of an answer to the jeers ofthe postilions upon his paleness. We stopped at a miserableosteria, in whose cellar we found a magnificent remain of Cyclopeanarchitecture,--as indeed in Italy one is paid at every step, fordiscomfort or danger, by some precious subject of thought. Weproceeded very slowly, and reached just at night a solitary littleinn, which marks the site of the ancient home of the Sabine virgins,snatched away to become the mothers of Rome. We were there salutedwith the news that the Tiber, also, had overflowed its banks, and itwas very doubtful if we could pass. But what else to do? There were noaccommodations in the house for thirty people, or even for three, andto sleep in the carriages, in that wet air of the marshes, was a morecertain danger than to attempt the passage. So we set forth; the moon,almost at the full, smiling sadly on the ancient grandeurs, then halfdraped in mist, then drawing over her face a thin white veil. As weapproached the Tiber, the towers and domes of Rome could be seen,like a cloud lying low on the horizon. The road and the meadows, alikeunder water, lay between us and it, one sheet of silver. The horsesentered; they behaved nobly; we proceeded, every moment uncertain ifthe water would not become deep; but the scene was beautiful, and Ienjoyed it highly. I have never yet felt afraid when really in thepresence of danger, though sometimes in its apprehension.At last we entered the gate; the diligence stopping to be examined, Iwalked to the gate of Villa Ludovisi, and saw its rich shrubberies ofmyrtle, and its statues so pale and eloquent in the moonlight.Is it not cruel that I cannot earn six hundred dollars a year, livinghere? I could live on that well, now I know Italy. Where I have been,this summer, a great basket of grapes sells for one cent!--delicioussalad, enough for three or four persons, one cent,--a pair ofchickens, fifteen cents. Foreigners cannot live so, but I could, nowthat I speak the language fluently, and know the price of everything.Everybody loves, and wants to serve me, and I cannot earn this pitifulsum to learn and do what I want.Of course, I wish to see America again; but in my own time, when I amready, and not to weep over hopes destroyed and projects unfulfilled.My dear friend, Madame Arconati, has shown me generous love;--a_contadina_, whom I have known this summer, hardly less. Every Sunday,she came in her holiday dress,--beautiful corset of red silk richlyembroidered, rich petticoat, nice shoes and stockings, and handsomecoral necklace, on one arm an immense basket of grapes, in the othera pair of live chickens, to be eaten by me for her sake, ("_per amoremio_,") and wanted no present, no reward; it was, as she said, "forthe honor and pleasure of her acquaintance." The old father of thefamily never met me but he took off his hat and said, "Madame, itis to me a _consolation_ to see you." Are there not sweet flowers ofaffection in life, glorious moments, great thoughts?--why must they beso dearly paid for?Many Americans have shown me great and thoughtful kindness, and nonemore so than W. S---- and his wife. They are now in Florence, butmay return. I do not know whether I shall stay here or not; shall beguided much by the state of my health.All is quieted now in Rome. Late at night the Pope had to yield, butnot till the door of his palace was half burnt, and his confessorkilled. This man, Parma, provoked his fate by firing on the peoplefrom a window. It seems the Pope never gave order to fire; his guardacted from a sudden impulse of their own. The new ministry chosen arelittle inclined to accept. It is almost impossible for any one to act,unless the Pope is stripped of his temporal power, and the hourfor that is not yet quite ripe; though they talk more and more ofproclaiming the Republic, and even of calling my friend Mazzini.If I came home at this moment, I should feel as if forced to leave myown house, my own people, and the hour which I had always longed for.If I do come in this way, all I can promise is to plague other peopleas little as possible. My own plans and desires will be postponed toanother world.Do not feel anxious about me. Some higher power leads me throughstrange, dark, thorny paths, broken at times by glades opening downinto prospects of sunny beauty, into which I am not permitted toenter. If God disposes for us, it is not for nothing. This I can say,my heart is in some respects better, it is kinder and more humble.Also, my mental acquisitions have certainly been great, howeverinadequate to my desires.TO M.S._Rome, Nov._ 23, 1848.--Mazzini has stood alone in Italy, on a sunnyheight, far above the stature of other men. He has fought a greatfight against folly, compromise, and treason; steadfast in hisconvictions, and of almost miraculous energy to sustain them, is he.He has foes; and at this moment, while he heads the insurrection inthe Valtellina, the Roman people murmur his name, and long to call himhere.How often rings in my ear the consolatory word of Koerner, after manystruggles, many undeceptions, "Though the million suffer shipwreck,yet noble hearts survive!"I grieve to say, the good-natured Pio has shown himself utterlyderelict, alike without resolution to abide by the good or the ill. Heis now abandoned and despised by both parties. The people do not trusthis word, for they know he shrinks from the danger, and shuts thedoor to pray quietly in his closet, whilst he knows the cardinals aremisusing his name to violate his pledges. The cardinals, chased fromRome, talk of electing an anti-Pope; because, when there was danger,he has always yielded to the people, and they say he has oversteppedhis prerogative, and broken his papal oath. No one abuses him, for itis felt that in a more private station he would have acted a kindlypart; but he has failed of so high a vocation, and balked so noble ahope, that no one respects him either. Who would have believed, a yearago, that the people would assail his palace? I was on Monte Cavalloyesterday, and saw the broken windows, the burnt doors, the wallsmarked by shot, just beneath the loggia, on which we have seen himgiving the benediction. But this would never have happened, if hisguard had not fired first on the people. It is true it was without hisorder, but, under a different man, the Swiss would never have dared toincur such a responsibility.Our old acquaintance, Sterbini, has risen to the ministry. He hasa certain influence, from his consistency and independence, but haslittle talent.Of me you wish to know; but there is little I can tell you at thisdistance. I have had happy hours, learned much, suffered much, andoutward things have not gone fortunately with me. I have had glorioushopes, but they are overclouded now, and the future looks darker thanever, indeed, quite impossible to my steps. I have no hope, unlessthat God will show me some way I do not know of now; but I do not wishto trouble you with more of this.TO W.S._Rome, Dec_. 9, 1848.--As to Florence itself, I do not like it, withthe exception of the galleries and churches, and Michel Angelo'smarbles. I do not like it, for the reason you _do_, because it seemslike home. It seems a kind of Boston to me,--the same good and thesame ill; I have had enough of both. But I have so many dear friendsin Boston, that I must always wish to go there sometimes; and thereare so many precious objects of study in Florence, that a stay ofseveral months could not fail to be full of interest. Still, thespring must be the time to be in Florence; there are so many charmingspots to visit in the environs, much nearer than those you go toin Rome, within scope of an afternoon's drive. I saw them only whenparched with sun and covered with dust. In the spring they must bevery beautiful.       *       *       *       *       *_December_, 1848.--I felt much what you wrote, "_if it were well withmy heart_." How seldom it is that a mortal is permitted to enjoy aparadisaical scene, unhaunted by some painful vision from the pastor the future! With me, too, dark clouds of care and sorrow havesometimes blotted out the sunshine. I have not lost from my side anonly sister, but have been severed from some visions still so dear,they looked almost like hopes. The future seems too difficult for me.I have been as happy as I could, and I feel that this summer, as last,had I been with my country folks, the picture of Italy would not havebeen so lively to me. Now I have been quite off the beaten track oftravel, have seen, thought, spoken, dreamed only what is Italian. Ihave learned much, received many strong and clear impressions. Whileamong the mountains, I was for a good while quite alone, except foroccasional chat with the contadine, who wanted to know if Pius IX. wasnot _un gran carbonaro!_--a reputation which he surely ought to haveforfeited by this time. About me they were disturbed: "_E sempre solasoletta_," they said, "_eh perche?_"Later, I made one of those accidental acquaintances, such as I havespoken of to you in my life of Lombardy, which may be called romantic:two brothers, elderly men, the last of a very noble family, formerlylords of many castles, still of more than one; both unmarried, men ofgreat polish and culture. None of the consequences ensued that wouldin romances: they did not any way adopt me, nor give me a casket ofdiamonds, nor any of their pictures, among which were originalsby several of the greatest masters, nor their rich cabinets, norminiatures on agate, nor carving in wood and ivory. They only showedme their things, and their family archives of more than a hundredvolumes, (containing most interesting documents about Poland, wherefour of their ancestors were nuncios,) manuscript letters from Tasso,and the like. With comments on these, and legendary lore enough tofurnish Cooper or Walter Scott with a thousand romances, they enrichedme; unhappily, I shall never have the strength or talent to make dueuse of it. I was sorry to leave them, for now I have recrossed thefrontier into the Roman States. I will not tell you where,--I knownot that I shall ever tell where,--these months have been passed. Thegreat Goethe hid thus in Italy; "Then," said he, "I did indeed feelalone,--when no former friend could form an _idea_ where I was." Whyshould not ---- and I enjoy this fantastic luxury of _incognito_ also,when we can so much more easily?I will not name the place, but I will describe it. The rooms arespacious and airy; the loggia of the sleeping room is rude, but itoverhangs a lovely little river, with its hedge of willows. Oppositeis a large and rich vineyard; on one side a ruined tower, on the otheran old casino, with its avenues of cypress, give human interest to thescene. A cleft amid the mountains full of light leads on the eye to asoft blue peak, very distant. At night the young moon trembles in theriver, and its soft murmur soothes me to sleep; it needs, for I havehad lately a bad attack upon the nerves, and been obliged to stopwriting for the present. I think I shall stay here some time, though Isuppose there are such sweet places all over Italy, if one only looksfor one's self. Poor, beautiful Italy! how she has been injured oflate! It is dreadful to see the incapacity and meanness of those towhom she had confided the care of her redemption.I have thus far passed this past month of fine weather mostdelightfully in revisiting my haunts of the autumn before. Then, too,I was uncommonly well and strong; it was the golden period of my Romanlife. The experience what long confinement may be expected after, fromthe winter rains, has decided me _never_ to make my hay when the sunshines: _i.e._, to give no fine day to books and pens.The places of interest I am nearest now are villas Albani andLudovisi, and Santa Agnese, St. Lorenzo, and the vineyards near PortaMaggiore. I have passed one day in a visit to Torre dei Schiaviand the neighborhood, and another on Monte Mario, both Rome and theCampagna-day golden in the mellowest lustre of the Italian sun. * * *But to you I may tell, that I always go with Ossoli, the mostcongenial companion I ever had for jaunts of this kind. We go out inthe morning, carrying the roast chestnuts from Rome; the bread andwine are found in some lonely little osteria; and so we dine; andreach Rome again, just in time to see it, from a little distance,gilded by the sunset.This moon having been so clear, and the air so warm, we have visited,on successive evenings, all the places we fancied: Monte Cavallo, nowso lonely and abandoned,--no lights there but moon and stars,--Trinitade' Monti, Santa Maria Maggiore, and the Forum. So now, if the rainmust come, or I be driven from Rome, I have all the images fair andfresh in my mind.About public events, why remain ignorant? Take a daily paper in thehouse. The Italian press has recovered from the effervescence ofchildish spirits;--you can now approximate to the truth from itsreports. There are many good papers now in Italy. Whatever representsthe Montanelli ministry is best for you. That gives the lead now. Isee good articles copied from the "Alba."TO MADAME ARCONATI._Rome, Feb. 5_, 1849.--I am so delighted to get your letter, that Imust answer on the instant. I try with all my force to march straightonwards,--to answer the claims of the day; to act out my feeling asseems right at the time, and not heed the consequences;--but in myaffections I am tender and weak; where I have really loved, a barrier,a break, causes me great suffering. I read in your letter that I amstill dear to you as you to me. I always felt, that if we had passedmore time together,--if the intimacy, for which there was ground inthe inner nature, had become consolidated,--no after differences ofopinion or conduct could have destroyed, though they might interruptits pleasure. But it was of few days' standing,--our interviews muchinterrupted. I felt as if I knew you much better than you could me,because I had occasion to see you amid your various and habitualrelations. I was afraid you might change, or become indifferent; now Ihope not.True, I have written, shall write, about the affairs of Italy, whatyou will much dislike, if ever you see it. I have done, may do,many things that would be very unpleasing to you; yet there _is_ acongeniality, I dare to say, pure, and strong, and good, at the bottomof the heart, far, far deeper than these differences, that wouldalways, on a real meeting, keep us friends. For me, I could never havebut one feeling towards you.Now, for the first time, I enjoy a full communion with the spirit ofRome. Last winter, I had here many friends; now all are dispersed,and sometimes I long to exchange thoughts with a friendly circle; butgenerally I am better content to live thus:--the impression made byall the records of genius around is more unbroken; I begin to be veryfamiliar with them. The sun shines always, when last winter it nevershone. I feel strong; I can go everywhere on foot. I pass whole daysabroad; sometimes I take a book, but seldom read it:--why should I,when every stone talks?In spring, I shall go often out of town. I have read "La RomeSouterraine" of Didier, and it makes me wish to see Ardea and Nettuno.Ostia is the only one of those desolate sites that I know yet. I studysometimes Niebuhr, and other books about Rome, but not to any greatprofit.In the circle of my friends, two have fallen. One a person of greatwisdom, strength, and calmness. She was ever to me a most tenderfriend, and one whose sympathy I highly valued. Like you by natureand education conservative, she was through thought liberal. With noexuberance or passionate impulsiveness herself, she knew how to allowfor these in others. The other was a woman of my years, of the mostprecious gifts in heart and genius. She had also beauty and fortune.She died at last of weariness and intellectual inanition. She never,to any of us, her friends, hinted her sufferings. But they wereobvious in her poems, which, with great dignity, expressed a resolutebut most mournful resignation.TO R.F.F._Rome, Feb_. 23, 1849.--It is something if one can get free foot-holdon the earth, so as not to be jostled out of hearing the music, ifthere should be any spirits in the air to make such.For my part, I have led rather too lonely a life of late. Before, itseemed as if too many voices of men startled away the inspirations;but having now lived eight months much alone, I doubt that good hascome of it, and think to return, and go with others for a little. Ihave realized in these last days the thought of Goethe,--"He who wouldin loneliness live, ah! he is soon alone. Each one loves, each onelives, and leaves him to his pain." I went away and hid, all summer.Not content with that, I said, on returning to Rome, I must be busyand receive people little. They have taken me at my word, and hardlyone comes to see me. Now, if I want play and prattle, I shall have torun after them. It is fair enough that we all, in turn, should be madeto feel our need of one another.Never was such a winter as this. Ten weeks now of unbroken sunshineand the mildest breezes. Of course, its price is to be paid. Thespring, usually divine here, with luxuriant foliage and multitudinousroses, will be all scorched and dusty. There is fear, too, of want offood for the poor Roman state.I pass my days in writing, walking, occasional visits to thegalleries. I read little, except the newspapers; these take up an houror two of the day. I own, my thoughts are quite fixed on the dailybulletin of men and things. I expect to write the history, but becauseit is so much in my heart. If you were here, I rather think you wouldbe impassive, like the two most esteemed Americans I see. They do notbelieve in the sentimental nations. Hungarians, Poles, Italians, aretoo demonstrative for them, too fiery, too impressible. They likebetter the loyal, slow-moving Germans: even the Russian, with hisdog's nose and gentlemanly servility, pleases them better than _my_people. There is an antagonism of race.TO E.S._Rome, June_ 6, 1849.--The help I needed was external, practical. Iknew myself all the difficulties and pains of my position; they werebeyond present relief; from sympathy I could struggle with them, buthad not life enough left, afterwards, to be a companion of any worth.To be with persons generous and refined, who would not pain; whowould sometimes lend a helping hand across the ditches of this strangeinsidious marsh, was all I could have now, and this you gave.On Sunday, from our loggia, I witnessed a terrible, a real battle. Itbegan at four in the morning: it lasted to the last gleam of light.The musket-fire was almost unintermitted; the roll of the cannon,especially from St. Angelo, most majestic. As all passed at Porta SanPancrazio and Villa Pamfili, I saw the smoke of every discharge, theflash of the bayonets; with a glass could see the men. Both French andItalians fought with the most obstinate valor. The French couldnot use their heavy cannon, being always driven away by the legionsGaribaldi and ----, when trying to find positions for them. The losson our side is about three hundred killed and wounded; theirs mustbe much greater. In one casino have been found seventy dead bodiesof theirs. I find the wounded men at the hospital in a transport ofindignation. The French soldiers fought so furiously, that they thinkthem false as their general, and cannot endure the remembrance oftheir visits, during the armistice, and talk of brotherhood. You willhave heard how all went:--how Lesseps, after appearing here fifteendays as _plenipotentiary_, signed a treaty not dishonorable to Rome;then Oudinot refused to ratify it, saying, _the plenipotentiaryhad surpassed his powers_: Lesseps runs back to Paris, and Oudinotattacks:--an affair alike infamous for the French from beginning toend. The cannonade on one side has continued day and night, (beingfull moon,) till this morning; they seeking to advance or take otherpositions, the Romans firing on them. The French throw rockets intothe town: one burst in the court-yard of the hospital, just as Iarrived there yesterday, agitating the poor sufferers very much; theysaid they did not want to die like mice in a trap.TO M.S._Rome, March_ 9, 1849.--Last night, Mazzini came to see me. You willhave heard how he was called to Italy, and received at Leghorn likea prince, as he is; unhappily, in fact, the only one, the only greatItalian. It is expected, that, if the republic lasts, he will bePresident. He has been made a Roman citizen, and elected to theAssembly; the labels bearing, in giant letters, "_Giuseppe Mazzini,cittadino Romano_," are yet up all over Rome. He entered by night, onfoot, to avoid demonstrations, no doubt, and enjoy the quiet of hisown thoughts, at so great a moment. The people went under his windowsthe next night, and called him out to speak; but I did not know aboutit. Last night, I heard a ring; then somebody speak my name; the voicestruck upon me at once. He looks more divine than ever, after allhis new, strange sufferings. He asked after all of you. He stayed twohours, and we talked, though rapidly, of everything. He hopes to comeoften, but the crisis is tremendous, and all will come on him; since,if any one can save Italy from her foes, inward and outward, it willbe he. But he is very doubtful whether this be possible; the foes aretoo many, too strong, too subtle. Yet Heaven helps sometimes. I onlygrieve I cannot aid him; freely would I give my life to aid him, onlybargaining for a quick death. I don't like slow torture. I fear thatit is in reserve for him, to survive defeat. True, he can never beutterly defeated; but to see Italy bleeding, prostrate once more, willbe very dreadful for him.He has sent me tickets, twice, to hear him speak in the Assembly. Itwas a fine, commanding voice. But, when he finished, he looked veryexhausted and melancholy. He looks as if the great battle he hadfought had been too much for his strength, and that he was onlysustained by the fire of the soul.All this I write to you, because you said, when I was suffering atleaving Mazzini,--"You will meet him in heaven." This I believe willbe, despite all my faults.[In April, 1849, Margaret was appointed, by the "Roman Commissionfor the succor of the wounded," to the charge of the hospital of the_Fate-Bene Fratetti_; the Princess Belgioioso having charge of the onealready opened. The following is a copy of the original letterfrom the Princess, which is written in English, announcing theappointment.]_Comitato di Soccorso Pei Feriti_,     }April 30, 1849.                        }Dear Miss Fuller:--You are named Regolatrice of the Hospital of the _Fate-Rene Fratelli_.Go there at twelve, if the alarm bell has not rung before. When youarrive there, you will receive all the women coming for the wounded,and give them your directions, so that you are sure to have a certainnumber of them night and day.May God help us.CHRISTINE TRIVULZE,of Belgioioso.Miss Fuller, Piazza Barberini, No. 60.TO R.W.E._Rome, June_ 10, 1849.--I received your letter amid the round ofcannonade and musketry. It was a terrible battle fought here from thefirst till the last light of day. I could see all its progress from mybalcony. The Italians fought like lions. It is a truly heroic spiritthat animates them. They make a stand here for honor and theirrights, with little ground for hope that they can resist, now they arebetrayed by France.Since the 30th April, I go almost daily to the hospitals, and,though I have suffered,--for I had no idea before, how terriblegunshot-wounds and wound-fever are,--yet I have taken pleasure, andgreat pleasure, in being with the men; there is scarcely one who isnot moved by a noble spirit. Many, especially among the Lombards,are the flower of the Italian youth. When they begin to get better, Icarry them books and flowers; they read, and we talk.The palace of the Pope, on the Quirinal, is now used forconvalescents. In those beautiful gardens, I walk with them,--one withhis sling, another with his crutch. The gardener plays off all hiswater-works for the defenders of the country, and gathers flowers forme, their friend.A day or two since, we sat in the Pope's little pavilion, where heused to give private audience. The sun was going gloriously down overMonte Mario, where gleamed the white tents of the French light-horseamong the trees. The cannonade was heard at intervals. Two bright-eyedboys sat at our feet, and gathered up eagerly every word said by theheroes of the day. It was a beautiful hour, stolen from the midst ofruin and sorrow; and tales were told as full of grace and pathos as inthe gardens of Boccaccio, only in a very different spirit,--with noblehope for man, with reverence for woman.The young ladies of the family, very young girls, were filled withenthusiasm for the suffering, wounded patriots, and they wished togo to the hospital to give their services. Excepting the threesuperintendents, none but married ladies were permitted to servethere, but their services were accepted. Their governess then wishedto go too, and, as she could speak several languages, she was admittedto the rooms of the wounded soldiers, to interpret for them, as thenurses knew nothing but Italian, and many of these poor men weresuffering, because they could not make their wishes known. Some areFrench, some German, and many Poles. Indeed, I am afraid it is tootrue that there were comparatively but few Romans among them. Thisyoung lady passed several nights there.Should I never return,--and sometimes I despair of doing so, it seemsso far off, so difficult, I am caught in such a net of ties here,--ifever you know of my life here, I think you will only wonder at theconstancy with which I have sustained myself; the degree of profit towhich, amid great difficulties, I have put the time, at least in theway of observation. Meanwhile, love me all you can; let me feel, that,amid the fearful agitations of the world, there are pure hands, withhealthful, even pulse, stretched out toward me, if I claim theirgrasp.I feel profoundly for Mazzini; at moments I am tempted to say, "Cursedwith every granted prayer,"--so cunning is the daemon. He is becomethe inspiring soul of his people. He saw Rome, to which all his hopesthrough life tended, for the first time as a Roman citizen, and tobecome in a few days its ruler. He has animated, he sustains her to aglorious effort, which, if it fails, this time, will not in the age.His country will be free. Yet to me it would be so dreadful to causeall this bloodshed, to dig the graves of such martyrs.Then Rome is being destroyed; her glorious oaks; her villas, haunts ofsacred beauty, that seemed the possession of the world forever,--thevilla of Raphael, the villa of Albani, home of Winkelmann, andthe best expression of the ideal of modern Rome, and so many othersanctuaries of beauty,--all must perish, lest a foe should level hismusket from their shelter. _I_ could not, could not!I know not, dear friend, whether I ever shall get home across thatgreat ocean, but here in Rome I shall no longer wish to live. O, Rome,_my_ country! could I imagine that the triumph of what I held dear wasto heap such desolation on thy head!Speaking of the republic, you say, do not I wish Italy had a greatman? Mazzini is a great man. In mind, a great poetic statesman; inheart, a lover; in action, decisive and full of resource as Caesar.Dearly I love Mazzini. He came in, just as I had finished the firstletter to you. His soft, radiant look makes melancholy music in mysoul; it consecrates my present life, that, like the Magdalen, I may,at the important hour, shed all the consecrated ointment on his head.There is one, Mazzini, who understands thee well; who knew thee noless when an object of popular fear, than now of idolatry; and who, ifthe pen be not held too feebly, will help posterity to know thee too.TO W.H.C._Rome, July_ 8, 1849.--I do not yet find myself tranquil and recruitedfrom the painful excitements of these last days. But, amid the ruinedhopes of Rome, the shameful oppressions she is beginning to suffer,amid these noble, bleeding martyrs, my brothers, I cannot fix mythoughts on anything else.I write that you may assure mother of my safety, which in the lastdays began to be seriously imperilled. Say, that as soon as I can findmeans of conveyance, without an expense too enormous, I shall go againinto the mountains. There I shall find pure, bracing air, and I hopestillness, for a time. Say, she need feel no anxiety, if she do nothear from me for some time. I may feel indisposed to write, as I donow; my heart is too full.Private hopes of mine are fallen with the hopes of Italy. I haveplayed for a new stake, and lost it. Life looks too difficult. Butfor the present I shall try to wave all thought of self and renew mystrength.After the attempt at revolution in France failed, could I haveinfluenced Mazzini, I should have prayed him to capitulate, and yet Ifeel that no honorable terms can be made with such a foe, and that theonly way is _never_ to yield; but the sound of the musketry, the sensethat men were perishing in a hopeless contest, had become too terriblefor my nerves. I did not see Mazzini, the last two weeks of therepublic. When the French entered, he walked about the streets, tosee how the people bore themselves, and then went to the house ofa friend. In the upper chamber of a poor house, with his life-longfriends,--the Modenas,--I found him. Modena, who abandoned not onlywhat other men hold dear,--home, fortune, peace,--but also endured,without the power of using the prime of his great artist-talent, aten years' exile in a foreign land; his wife every way worthy ofhim,--such a woman as I am not.Mazzini had suffered millions more than I could; he had borne hisfearful responsibility; he had let his dearest friends perish; he hadpassed all these nights without sleep; in two short months, he hadgrown old; all the vital juices seemed exhausted; his eyes were allblood-shot; his skin orange; flesh he had none; his hair was mixedwith white: his hand was painful to the touch; but he had neverflinched, never quailed; had protested in the last hour againstsurrender; sweet and calm, but full of a more fiery purpose than ever;in him I revered the hero, and owned myself not of that mould.You say truly, I shall come home humbler. God grant it may be entirelyhumble! In future, while more than ever deeply penetrated withprinciples, and the need of the martyr spirit to sustain them, I willever own that there are few worthy, and that I am one of the least.A silken glove might be as good a gauntlet as one of steel, but I,infirm of mood, turn sick even now as I think of the past.       *       *       *       *       *_July_, 1849.--I cannot tell you what I endured in leaving Rome;abandoning the wounded soldiers; knowing that there is no provisionmade for them, when they rise from the beds where they have beenthrown by a noble courage, where they have suffered with a noblepatience. Some of the poorer men, who rise bereft even of the rightarm,--one having lost both the right arm and the right leg,--I couldhave provided for with a small sum. Could I have sold my hair, orblood from my arm, I would have done it. Had any of the rich Americansremained in Rome, they would have given it to me; they helped nobly atfirst, in the service of the hospitals, when there was far less need;but they had all gone. What would I have given that I could havespoken to one of the Lawrences, or the Phillipses; they could andwould have saved the misery. These poor men are left helpless inthe power of a mean and vindictive foe. You felt so oppressed in theslave-states; imagine what I felt at seeing all the noblest youth, allthe genius of this dear land, again enslaved.TO W.H.C._Rieti, Aug_. 28, 1849.--You say, you are glad I have had this greatopportunity for carrying out my principles. Would it were so! I foundmyself inferior in courage and fortitude to the occasion. I knew nothow to bear the havoc and anguish incident to the struggle for theseprinciples. I rejoiced that it lay not with me to cut down the trees,to destroy the Elysian gardens, for the defence of Rome; I do not knowthat I could have done it. And the sight of these far nobler growths,the beautiful young men, mown down in their stately prime, became toomuch for me. I forget the great ideas, to sympathize with the poormothers, who had nursed their precious forms, only to see themall lopped and gashed. You say, I sustained them; often have theysustained my courage: one, kissing the pieces of bone that were sopainfully extracted from his arm, hanging them round his neck to beworn as the true relics of to-day; mementoes that he also had done andborne something for his country and the hopes of humanity. One fairyoung man, who is made a cripple for life, clasped my hand as he sawme crying over the spasms I could not relieve, and faintly cried,"Viva l'Italia." "Think only, _cara bona donna_" said a poor woundedsoldier, "that I can always wear my uniform on _festas_, just as it isnow, with the holes where the balls went through, for a memory." "Godis good; God knows," they often said to me, when I had not a word tocheer them.THE WIFE AND MOTHER.[A]Beneath the ruins of the Roman Republic, how many private fortuneswere buried! and among these victims was Margaret. In thatcatastrophe, were swallowed up hopes sacredly cherished by her throughweary months, at the risk of all she most prized.Soon after the entrance of the French, she wrote thus, to the residentEnvoy of the United States:My dear Mr. Cass,--I beg you to come and see me, and give me yourcounsel, and, if need be, your aid, to get away from Rome. From whatI hear this morning, I fear we may be once more shut up here; and Ishall die, to be again separated from what I hold most dear. Thereare, as yet, no horses on the way we want to go, or we should postimmediately.You may feel, like me, sad, in these last moments, to leave thisinjured Rome. So many noble hearts I abandon here, whose woes I haveknown! I feel, if I could not aid, I might soothe. But for my child, Iwould not go, till some men, now sick, know whether they shall live ordie.       *       *       *       *       *Her child! Where was he? In RIETI,--at the foot of the UmbrianApennines,--a day's journey to the north-east of Rome. ThitherMargaret escaped with her husband, and thence she wrote the followingletter:Dearest Mother,--I received your letter a few hours before leavingRome. Like all of yours, it refreshed me, and gave me as muchsatisfaction as anything could, at that sad time. Its spirit isof eternity, and befits an epoch when wickedness and perfidy soimpudently triumph, and the best blood of the generous and honorableis poured out like water, seemingly in vain.I cannot tell you what I suffered to abandon the wounded to the careof their mean foes; to see the young men, that were faithful to theirvows, hunted from their homes,--hunted like wild beasts; denied arefuge in every civilized land. Many of those I loved are sunk to thebottom of the sea, by Austrian cannon, or will be shot. Others are inpenury, grief, and exile. May God give due recompense for all that hasbeen endured!My mind still agitated, and my spirits worn out, I have not felt likewriting to any one. Yet the magnificent summer does not smile quitein vain for me. Much exercise in the open air, living much on milkand fruit, have recruited my health, and I am regaining the habit ofsleep, which a month of nightly cannonade in Rome had destroyed.       *       *       *       *       *Receiving, a few days since, a packet of letters from America, Iopened them with more feeling of hope and good cheer, than for a longtime past. The first words that met my eye were these, in the hand ofMr. Greeley:--"Ah, Margaret, the world grows dark with us! You grieve,for Rome is fallen;--I mourn, for Pickie is dead."I have shed rivers of tears over the inexpressibly affecting letterthus begun. One would think I might have become familiar enough withimages of death and destruction; yet somehow the image of Pickie'slittle dancing figure, lying, stiff and stark, between his parents,has made me weep more than all else. There was little hope he could dojustice to himself, or lead a happy life in so perplexed a world;but never was a character of richer capacity,--never a more charmingchild. To me he was most dear, and would always have been so. Had hebecome stained with earthly faults, I could never have forgotten whathe was when fresh from the soul's home, and what he was to me when mysoul pined for sympathy, pure and unalloyed.The three children I have seen who were fairest in my eyes, and gavemost promise of the future, were Waldo, Pickie, Hermann Clarke;--allnipped in the bud. Endless thoughts has this given me, and a resolveto seek the realization of all hopes and plans elsewhere, whichresolve will weigh with me as much as it can weigh before the silvercord is finally loosed. Till then, Earth, our mother, always findsstrange, unexpected ways to draw us back to her bosom,--to make usseek anew a nutriment which has never failed to cause us frequentsickness.       *       *       *       *       *This brings me to the main object of my present letter,--a pieceof intelligence about myself, which I had hoped I might be ableto communicate in such a way as to give you _pleasure_. That Icannot,--after suffering much in silence with that hope,--is like therest of my earthly destiny.The first moment, it may cause you a pang to know that your eldestchild might long ago have been addressed by another name than yours,and has a little son a year old.But, beloved mother, do not feel this long. I do assure you, that itwas only great love for you that kept me silent. I have abstained ahundred times, when your sympathy, your counsel, would have been mostprecious, from a wish not to harass you with anxiety. Even now I wouldabstain, but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for usto live publicly and permanently together; and we have no hope, inthe present state of Italian affairs, that we can do it at any betteradvantage, for several years, than now.My husband is a Roman, of a noble but now impoverished house. Hismother died when he was an infant, his father is dead since we met,leaving some property, but encumbered with debts, and in the presentstate of Rome hardly available, except by living there. He hasthree older brothers, all provided for in the Papal service,--one asSecretary of the Privy Chamber, the other two as members of the GuardNoble. A similar career would have been opened to him, but he embracedliberal principles, and, with the fall of the Republic, has lostall, as well as the favor of his family, who all sided with the Pope.Meanwhile, having been an officer in the Republican service, it wasbest for him to leave Rome. He has taken what little money he had,and we plan to live in Florence for the winter. If he or I can getthe means, we shall come together to the United States, in thesummer;--earlier we could not, on account of the child.He is not in any respect such a person as people in general wouldexpect to find with me. He had no instructor except an old priest,who entirely neglected his education; and of all that is containedin books he is absolutely ignorant, and he has no enthusiasm ofcharacter. On the other hand, he has excellent practical sense; hasbeen a judicious observer of all that passed before his eyes; has anice sense of duty, which, in its unfailing, minute activity, mayput most enthusiasts to shame; a very sweet temper, and great nativerefinement. His love for me has been unswerving and most tender. Ihave never suffered a pain that he could relieve. His devotion, whenI am ill, is to be compared only with yours. His delicacy in trifles,his sweet domestic graces, remind me of E----. In him I have found ahome, and one that interferes with no tie. Amid many ills andcares, we have had much joy together, in the sympathy with naturalbeauty,--with our child,--with all that is innocent and sweet.I do not know whether he will always love me so well, for I amthe elder, and the difference will become, in a few years, moreperceptible than now. But life is so uncertain, and it is so necessaryto take good things with their limitations, that I have not thought itworth while to calculate too curiously.However my other friends may feel, I am sure that _you_ will lovehim very much, and that he will love you no less. Could we all livetogether, on a moderate income, you would find peace with us. Heavengrant, that, on returning, I may gain means to effect this object.He, of course, can do nothing, while we are in the United States, butperhaps I can; and now that my health is better, I shall be able toexert myself, if sure that my child is watched by those who love him,and who are good and pure.       *       *       *       *       *What shall I say of my child? All might seem hyperbole, even to mydearest mother. In him I find satisfaction, for the first time, to thedeep wants of my heart. Yet, thinking of those other sweet ones fled,I must look upon him as a treasure only lent. He is a fair child, withblue eyes and light hair; very affectionate, graceful, and sportive.He was baptized, in the Roman Catholic Church, by the name of AngeloEugene Philip, for his father, grandfather, and my brother. Heinherits the title of marquis.Write the name of my child in your Bible, ANGELO OSSOLI, _bornSeptember_ 5, 1848. God grant he may live to see you, and may proveworthy of your love!More I do not feel strength to say. You can hardly guess how allattempt to express something about the great struggles and experiencesof my European life enfeebles me. When I get home,--if ever I do,--itwill be told without this fatigue and excitement. I trust there willbe a little repose, before entering anew on this wearisome conflict.I had addressed you twice,--once under the impression that I shouldnot survive the birth of my child; again during the siege of Rome, thefather and I being both in danger. I took Mrs. Story, and, when sheleft Rome, Mr. Cass, into my confidence. Both were kind as sisterand brother. Amid much pain and struggle, sweet, is the memory ofthe generous love I received from William and Emelyn Story, and theiruncle. They helped me gently through a most difficult period. Mr.Cass, also, who did not know me at all, has done everything possiblefor me.       *       *       *       *       *A letter to her sister fills out these portraits of her husband andchild.       *       *       *       *       *About Ossoli[B] I do not like to say much, as he is an exceedinglydelicate person. He is not precisely reserved, but it is not naturalto him to talk about the objects of strong affection. I am sure hewould not try to describe me to his sister, but would rather she wouldtake her own impression of me; and, as much as possible, I wish todo the same by him. I presume that, to many of my friends, he willbe nothing, and they will not understand that I should have life incommon with him. But I do not think he will care;--he has not theslightest tinge of self-love. He has, throughout our intercourse, beenused to my having many such ties. He has no wish to be anything topersons with whom he does not feel spontaneously bound, and when I amoccupied, is happy in himself. But some of my friends and my family,who will see him in the details of practical life, cannot fail toprize the purity and simple strength of his character; and, shouldhe continue to love me as he has done, his companionship will be aninestimable blessing to me. I say _if_, because all human affectionsare frail, and I have experienced too great revulsions in my own, notto know it. Yet I feel great confidence in the permanence of his love.It has been unblemished so far, under many trials; especially as Ihave been more desponding and unreasonable, in many ways, than I everwas before, and more so, I hope, than I ever shall be again. But atall such times, he never had a thought except to sustain and cheer me.He is capable of the sacred love,--the love passing that of woman. Heshowed it to his father, to Rome, to me. Now he loves his child in thesame way. I think he will be an excellent father, though he could notspeculate about it, nor, indeed, about anything.Our meeting was singular,--fateful, I may say. Very soon he offered mehis hand through life, but I never dreamed I should take it. I lovedhim, and felt very unhappy to leave him; but the connection seemed soevery way unfit, I did not hesitate a moment. He, however, thoughtI should return to him, as I did. I acted upon a strong impulse, andcould not analyze at all what passed in my mind. I neither rejoicenor grieve;--for bad or for good, I acted out my character Had I neverconnected myself with any one, my path was clear; now it is allhid; but, in that case, my development must have been partial. Asto marriage, I think the intercourse of heart and mind may be fullyenjoyed without entering into this partnership of daily life. Still,I do not find it burdensome. The friction that I have seen mar so muchthe domestic happiness of others does not occur with us, or, at least,has not occurred. Then, there is the pleasure of always being at handto help one another.Still, the great novelty, the immense gain, to me, is my relation withmy child. I thought the mother's heart lived in me before, but it didnot;--I knew nothing about it. Yet, before his birth, I dreaded it.I thought I should not survive: but if I did, and my child did, was Inot cruel to bring another into this terrible world? I could not, atthat time, get any other view. When he was born, that deep melancholychanged at once into rapture: but it did not last long. Then came theprudential motherhood. I grew a coward, a care-taker, not only for themorrow, but, impiously faithless, for twenty or thirty years ahead.It seemed very wicked to have brought the little tender thing intothe midst of cares and perplexities we had not feared in the leastfor ourselves. I imagined everything;--he was to be in danger ofevery enormity the Croats were then committing upon the infantsof Lombardy;--the house would be burned over his head; but, if heescaped, how were we to get money to buy his bibs and primers? Thenhis father was to be killed in the fighting, and I to die of my cough,&c. &c.During the siege of Rome, I could not see my little boy. What Iendured at that time, in various ways, not many would survive. In theburning sun, I went, every day, to wait, in the crowd, for lettersabout him. Often they did not come. I saw blood that had streamed onthe wall where Ossoli was. I have a piece of a bomb that burst closeto him. I sought solace in tending the suffering men; but when Ibeheld the beautiful fair young men bleeding to death, or mutilatedfor life, I felt the woe of all the mothers who had nursed each tothat full flower, to see them thus cut down. I felt the _consolation_,too,--for those youths died worthily. I was a Mater Dolorosa, and Iremembered that she who helped Angelino into the world came from thesign of the Mater Dolorosa. I thought, even if he lives, if he comesinto the world at this great troubled time, terrible with perplexedduties, it may be to die thus at twenty years, one of a glorioushecatomb, indeed, but still a sacrifice! It seemed then I was willinghe should die.       *       *       *       *       *Angelino's birth-place is thus sketched:My baby saw mountains when he first looked forward into the world.RIETI,--not only an old classic town of Italy, but one founded by whatare now called the Aborigines,--is a hive of very ancient dwellingswith red brown roofs, a citadel and several towers. It is in aplain, twelve miles in diameter one way, not much less the other, andentirely encircled with mountains of the noblest form. Casinos andhermitages gleam here and there on their lower slopes. This plain isalmost the richest in Italy, and full of vineyards. Rieti is near thefoot of the hills on one side, and the rapid Velino makes almost thecircuit of its walls, on its way to Terni. I had my apartment shut outfrom the family, on the bank of this river, and saw the mountains, asI lay on my restless couch. There was a piazza, too, or, as they callit here, a loggia, which hung over the river, where I walked most ofthe night, for I could not sleep at all in those months. In the wildautumn storms, the stream became a roaring torrent, constantly lit upby lightning flashes, and the sound of its rush was very sublime. Isee it yet, as it swept away on its dark green current the heaps ofburning straw which the children let down from the bridge. Oppositemy window was a vineyard, whose white and purple clusters were my foodfor three months. It was pretty to watch the vintage,--the asses andwagons loaded with this wealth of amber and rubies,--the naked boys,singing in the trees on which the vines are trained, as they cut thegrapes,--the nut-brown maids and matrons, in their red corsets andwhite head-clothes, receiving them below, while the babies and littlechildren were frolicking in the grass.In Rieti, the ancient Umbrians were married thus. In presence offriends, the man and maid received together the gifts of fire andwater; the bridegroom then conducted to his house the bride. At thedoor, he gave her the keys, and, entering, threw behind him nuts, as asign that he renounced all the frivolities of boyhood.I intend to write all that relates to the birth of Angelino, in alittle book, which I shall, I hope, show you sometime. I have begunit, and then stopped;--it seemed to me he would die. If he lives, Ishall finish it, before the details are at all faded in my mind. Rietiis a place where I should have liked to have him born, and where Ishould like to have him now,--but that the people are so wicked. Theyare the most ferocious and mercenary population of Italy. I did notknow this, when I went there, and merely expected to be solitary andquiet among poor people. But they looked on the "Marchioness" as anignorant _Inglese_, and they fancy all _Inglesi_ have wealth untold.Me they were bent on plundering in every way. They made me sufferterribly in the first days.[Footnote A: The first part of this chapter is edited by R.W.E.; theremainder by W.H.C.][Footnote B: Giovanni Angelo Ossoli.]THE PRIVATE MARRIAGE.The high-minded friend, spoken of with such grateful affection byMargaret, in her letter to her mother, thus gracefully narrates theromance of her marriage; and the narrative is a noble proof of theheroic disinterestedness with which, amidst her own engrossing trials,Margaret devoted herself to others. Mrs. Story writes as follows:--    "During the month of November, 1847, we arrived in Rome,    purposing to spend the winter there. At that time, Margaret    was living in the house of the Marchesa ----, in the Corso,    _Ultimo Piano_. Her rooms were pleasant and cheerful, with    a certain air of elegance and refinement, but they had not    a sunny exposure, that all-essential requisite for health,    during the damp Roman winter. Margaret suffered from ill    health this winter, and she afterwards attributed it mainly    to the fact, that she had not the sun. As soon as she heard of    our arrival, she stretched forth a friendly, cordial hand, and    greeted us most warmly. She gave us great assistance in our    search for convenient lodgings, and we were soon happily    established near her. Our intercourse was henceforth most    frequent and intimate, and knew no cloud nor coldness. Daily    we were much with her, and daily we felt more sensible of the    worth and value of our friend. To me she seemed so unlike what    I had thought her to be in America, that I continually said,    'How have I misjudged you,--you are not at all such a person    as I took you to be.' To this she replied, 'I am not the    same person, but in many respects another;--my life has new    channels now, and how thankful I am that I have been able to    come out into larger interests,--but, partly, you did not know    me at home in the true light.' It was true, that I had not    known her much personally, when in Boston; but through her    friends, who were mine also, I had learned to think of her    as a person on intellectual stilts, with a large share of    arrogance, and little sweetness of temper. How unlike to    this was she now!--so delicate, so simple, confiding, and    affectionate; with a true womanly heart and soul, sensitive    and generous, and, what was to me a still greater surprise,    possessed of so broad a charity, that she could cover with its    mantle the faults and defects of all about her.    "We soon became acquainted with the young Marquis Ossoli, and    met him frequently at Margaret's rooms. He appeared to be of    a reserved and gentle nature, with quiet, gentleman-like    manners, and there was something melancholy in the expression    of his face, which made one desire to know more of him. In    figure, he was tall, and of slender frame, with dark hair    and eyes; we judged that he was about thirty years of age,    possibly younger. Margaret spoke of him most frankly, and soon    told us the history of her first acquaintance with him, which,    as nearly as I can recall, was as follows:--    "She went to hear vespers, the evening of 'Holy Thursday,'    soon after her first coming to Rome, in the spring of 1847, at    St. Peter's. She proposed to her companions that some place    in the church should be designated, where, after the services,    they should meet,--she being inclined, as was her custom    always in St. Peter's, to wander alone among the different    chapels. When, at length, she saw that the crowd was    dispersing, she returned to the place assigned, but could not    find her party. In some perplexity, she walked about, with her    glass carefully examining each group. Presently, a young man    of gentlemanly address came up to her, and begged, if she were    seeking any one, that he might be permitted to assist her; and    together they continued the search through all parts of the    church. At last, it became evident, beyond a doubt, that her    party could no longer be there, and, as it was then quite    late, the crowd all gone, they went out into the piazza to    find a carriage, in which she might go home. In the piazza, in    front of St. Peter's, generally may be found many carriages;    but, owing to the delay they had made, there were then none,    and Margaret was compelled to walk, with her stranger friend,    the long distance between the Vatican and the Corso. At    this time, she had little command of the language for    conversational purposes, and their words were few, though    enough to create in each a desire for further knowledge and    acquaintance. At her door, they parted, and Margaret, finding    her friends already at home, related the adventure."This chance meeting at vesper service in St. Peter's prepared theway for many interviews; and it was before Margaret's departure forVenice, Milan, and Como, that Ossoli first offered her his hand, andwas refused. Mrs. Story continues:--    "After her return to Rome, they met again, and he became her    constant visitor; and as, in those days, Margaret watched with    intense interest the tide of political events, his mind was    also turned in the direction of liberty and better government.    Whether Ossoli, unassisted, would have been able to emancipate    himself from the influence of his family and early education,    both eminently conservative and narrow, may be a question; but    that he did throw off the shackles, and espouse the cause of    Roman liberty with warm zeal, is most certain. Margaret had    known Mazzini in London, had partaken of his schemes for the    future of his country, and was taking every pains to inform    herself in regard to the action of all parties, with a view    to write a history of the period. Ossoli brought her every    intelligence that might be of interest to her, and busied    himself in learning the views of both parties, that she might    be able to judge the matter impartially.    "Here I may say, that, in the estimation of most of those who    were in Italy at this time, the loss of Margaret's history    and notes is a great and irreparable one. No one could have    possessed so many avenues of direct information from both    sides. While she was the friend and correspondent of Mazzini,    and knew the springs of action of his party; through her    husband's family and connections, she knew the other view; so    that, whatever might be the value of her deductions, her facts    could not have been other than of highest worth. Together,    Margaret and Ossoli went to the meetings of either side; and    to her he carried all the flying reports of the day, such as    he had heard in the cafe, or through his friends.    "In a short time, we went to Naples, and Margaret, in the    course of a few months, to Aquila and Rieti. Meanwhile, we    heard from her often by letter, and wrote to urge her to join    us in our villa at Sorrento. During this summer, she wrote    constantly upon her history of the Italian movement, for which    she had collected materials through the past winter. We did    not again meet, until the following spring, March, 1849, when    we went from Florence back to Rome. Once more we were with    her, then, in most familiar every-day intercourse, and as at    this time a change of government had taken place,--the Pope    having gone to Molo di Gaeta.--we watched with her the great    movements of the day. Ossoli was now actively interested on    the liberal side; he was holding the office of captain in the    _Guardia Civica_, and enthusiastically looking forward to the    success of the new measures.    "During the spring of 1849, Mazzini came to Rome. He went at    once to see Margaret, and at her rooms met Ossoli. After this    interview with Mazzini, it was quite evident that they had    lost something of the faith and hopeful certainty with which    they had regarded the issue, for Mazzini had discovered    the want of singleness of purpose in the leaders of the    Provisional Government. Still zealously Margaret and Ossoli    aided in everything the progress of events; and when it was    certain that the French had landed forces at Civita Vecchia,    and would attack Rome, Ossoli took station with his men on the    walls of the Vatican gardens, where he remained faithfully    to the end of the attack. Margaret had, at the same time, the    entire charge of one of the hospitals, and was the assistant    of the Princess Belgioioso, in charge of '_dei Pellegrini_,'    where, during the first day, they received seventy wounded    men, French and Romans.    "Night and day, Margaret was occupied, and, with the princess,    so ordered and disposed the hospitals, that their conduct was    truly admirable. All the work was skilfully divided, so    that there was no confusion or hurry and, from the chaotic    condition in which these places had been left by the    priests,--who previously had charge of them,--they brought    them to a state of perfect regularity and discipline. Of money    they had very little, and they were obliged to give their time    and thoughts, in its place. From the Americans in Rome, they    raised a subscription for the aid of the wounded of either    party; but, besides this, they had scarcely any means to use.    I have walked through the wards with Margaret, and seen how    comforting was her presence to the poor suffering men. 'How    long will the Signora stay?' 'When will the Signora come    again?' they eagerly asked. For each one's peculiar tastes she    had a care: to one she carried books; to another she told the    news of the day; and listened to another's oft-repeated tale    of wrongs, as the best sympathy she could give. They raised    themselves up on their elbows, to get the last glimpse of her    as she was going away. There were some of the sturdy fellows    of Garibaldi's Legion there, and to them she listened, as they    spoke with delight of their chief, of his courage and    skill; for he seemed to have won the hearts of his men in a    remarkable manner.    "One incident I may as well narrate in this connection. It    happened, that, some time before the coming of the French,    while Margaret was travelling quite by herself, on her    return from a visit to her child, who was out at nurse in the    country, she rested for an hour or two at a little wayside    _osteria_. While there, she was startled by the _padrone_,    who, with great alarm, rushed into the room, and said, 'We    are quite lost! here is the Legion Garibaldi! These men always    pillage, and, if we do not give all up to them without pay,    they will kill us.' Margaret looked out upon the road, and    saw that it was quite true, that the legion was coming    thither with all speed. For a moment, she said, she felt    uncomfortably; for such was the exaggerated account of the    conduct of the men, that she thought it quite possible that    they would take her horses, and so leave her without the means    of proceeding on her journey. On they came, and she determined    to offer them a lunch at her own expense; having faith that    gentleness and courtesy was the best protection from injury.    Accordingly, as soon as they arrived, and rushed boisterously    into the _osteria_, she rose, and said to the _padrone_, 'Give    these good men wine and bread on my account; for, after their    ride, they must need refreshment.' Immediately, the noise and    confusion subsided; with respectful bows to her, they seated    themselves and partook of the lunch, giving her an account of    their journey. When she was ready to go, and her _vettura_ was    at the door, they waited upon her, took down the steps,    and assisted her with much gentleness and respectfulness of    manner, and she drove off, wondering how men with such natures    could have the reputation they had. And, so far as we could    gather, except in this instance, their conduct was of a most    disorderly kind.    "Again, on another occasion, she showed how great was her    power over rude men. This was when two _contadini_ at Rieti,    being in a violent quarrel, had rushed upon each other with    knives. Margaret was called by the women bystanders, as the    Signora who could most influence them to peace. She went    directly up to the men, whose rage was truly awful to behold,    and, stepping between them, commanded them to separate. They    parted, but with such a look of deadly revenge, that Margaret    felt her work was but half accomplished. She therefore sought    them out separately, and talked with each, urging forgiveness;    it was long, however, before she could see any change of    purpose, and only by repeated conversations was it, that she    brought about her desire, and saw them meet as friends. After    this, her reputation as peace-maker was great, and the women    in the neighborhood came to her with long tales of trouble,    urging her intervention. I have never known anything more    extraordinary than this influence of hers over the passion and    violence of the Italian character. Repeated instances come    to my mind, when a look from her has had more power to quiet    excitement, than any arguments and reasonings that could be    brought to bear upon the subject. Something quite superior and    apart from them, the people thought her, and yet knew her as    the gentle and considerate judge of their vices.    "I may also mention here, that Margaret's charities, according    to her means, were larger than those of any other whom I ever    knew. At one time, in Rome, while she lived upon the simplest,    slenderest fare, spending only some ten or twelve cents a day    for her dinner, she lent, unsolicited, her last fifty dollars    to an artist, who was then in need. That it would ever be    returned to her, she did not know; but the doubt did not    restrain the hand from giving. In this instance, it was soon    repaid her; but her charities were not always towards the most    deserving. Repeated instances of the false pretences, under    which demands for charity are made, were known to her after    she had given to unworthy objects; but no experience of this    sort ever checked her kindly impulse to give, and being once    deceived taught her no lesson of distrust. She ever listened    with ready ear to all who came to her in any form of distress.    Indeed, to use the language of another friend, 'the prevalent    impression at Rome, among all who knew her, was, that she was    a mild saint and a ministering angel.'    "I have, in order to bring in these instances of her influence    on those about her, deviated from my track. We return to the    life she led in Rome during the attack of the French, and her    charge of the hospitals, where she spent daily some seven or    eight hours, and, often, the entire night. Her feeble frame    was a good deal shaken by so uncommon a demand upon her    strength, while, at the same time, the anxiety of her mind was    intense. I well remember how exhausted and weary she was;    how pale and agitated she returned to us after her day's and    night's watching; how eagerly she asked for news of Ossoli,    and how seldom we had any to give her, for he was unable to    send her a word for two or three days at a time. Letters    from the country there were few or none, as the communication    between Rieti and Rome was cut off.    "After one such day, she called me to her bedside, and said    that I must consent, for her sake, to keep the SECRET she was    about to confide. Then she told me of her marriage; where her    child was, and where he was born; and gave me certain papers    and parchment documents which I was to keep; and, in the event    of her and her husband's death, I was to take the boy to her    mother in America, and confide him to her care, and that of    her friend, Mrs. ----.    "The papers thus given me, I had perfect liberty to read; but    after she had told me her story, I desired no confirmation of    this fact, beyond what her words had given. One or two of the    papers she opened, and we together read them. One was written    on parchment, in Latin, and was a certificate, given by the    priest who married them, saying that Angelo Eugene Ossoli was    the legal heir of whatever title and fortune should come to    his father. To this was affixed his seal, with those of the    other witnesses, and the Ossoli crest was drawn in full    upon the paper. There was also a book, in which Margaret had    written the history of her acquaintance and marriage with    Ossoli, and of the birth of her child. In giving that to    me, she said, 'If I do not survive to tell this myself to my    family, this book will be to them invaluable. Therefore keep    it for them. If I live, it will be of no use, for my word will    be all that they will ask.' I took the papers, and locked them    up. Never feeling any desire to look into them, I never did;    and as she gave them to me, I returned them to her, when I    left Rome for Switzerland.    "After this, she often spoke to me of the necessity there    had been, and still existed, for her keeping her marriage    a secret. At the time, I argued in favor of her making it    public, but subsequent events have shown me the wisdom of her    decision. The _explanation_ she gave me of the secret marriage    was this:    "They were married in December, soon after,--as I think,    though I am not positive,--the death of the old Marquis    Ossoli. The estate he had left was undivided, and the two    brothers, attached to the Papal household, were to be the    executors. This patrimony was not large, but, when fairly    divided, would bring to each a little property,--an income    sufficient, with economy, for life in Rome. Everyone knows,    that law is subject to ecclesiastical influence in Rome, and    that marriage with a Protestant would be destructive to all    prospects of favorable administration. And beside being    of another religious faith, there was, in this case, the    additional crime of having married a liberal,--one who had    publicly interested herself in radical views. Taking the two    facts together, there was good reason to suppose, that, if the    marriage were known, Ossoli must be a beggar, and a banished    man, under the then existing government; while, by waiting a    little, there was a chance,--a fair one, too,--of an honorable    post under the new government, whose formation every one was    anticipating. Leaving Rome, too, at that time, was deserting    the field wherein they might hope to work much good, and where    they felt that they were needed. Ossoli's brothers had    long before begun to look jealously upon him. Knowing his    acquaintance with Margaret, they feared the influence she    might exert over his mind in favor of liberal sentiments, and    had not hesitated to threaten him with the Papal displeasure.    Ossoli's education had been such, that it certainly argues an    uncommon elevation of character, that he remained so firm and    single in his political views, and was so indifferent to the    pecuniary advantages which his former position offered, since,    during many years, the Ossoli family had been high in favor    and in office, in Rome, and the same vista opened for his own    future, had he chosen to follow their lead. The Pope left    for Molo di Gaeta, and then came a suspension of all legal    procedure, so that the estate was never divided, before we    left Italy, and I do not know that it has ever been.    "Ossoli had the feeling, that, while his own sister and family    could not be informed of his marriage, no others should know    of it; and from day to day they hoped on for the favorable    change which should enable them to declare it. Their child was    born; and, for his sake, in order to defend him, as Margaret    said, from the stings of poverty, they were patient waiters    for the restored law of the land. Margaret felt that she    would, at any cost to herself, gladly secure for her child a    condition above want; and, although it was a severe trial,--as    her letters to us attest,--she resolved to wait, and hope,    and keep her secret. At the time when she took me into her    confidence, she was so full of anxiety and dread of some    shock, from which she might not recover, that it was    absolutely necessary to make it known to some friend. She    was living with us at the time, and she gave it to me. Most    sacredly, but timidly, did I keep her secret; for, all the    while, I was tormented with a desire to be of active service    to her, and I was incapacitated from any action by the    position in which I was placed.    "Ossoli's post was one of considerable danger, he being in one    of the most exposed places; and, as Margaret saw his wounded    and dying comrades, she felt that another shot might take him    from her, or bring him to her care in the hospital. Eagerly    she watched the carts, as they came up with their suffering    loads, dreading that her worst fears might be confirmed. No    argument of ours could persuade Ossoli to leave his post to    take food or rest. Sometimes we went to him, and carried a    concealed basket of provisions, but he shared it with so many    of his fellows, that his own portion must have been almost    nothing. Haggard, worn, and pale, he walked over the Vatican    grounds with us, pointing out, now here, now there, where some    poor fellow's blood sprinkled the wall; Margaret was with us,    and for a few moments they could have an anxious talk about    their child.    "To get to the child, or to send to him, was quite impossible,    and for days they were in complete ignorance about him. At    length, a letter came; and in it the nurse declared that    unless they should immediately send her, in advance-payment, a    certain sum of money, she would altogether abandon Angelo. It    seemed, at first, impossible to forward the money, the road    was so insecure, and the bearer of any parcel was so likely    to be seized by one party or the other, and to be treated as    a spy. But finally, after much consideration, the sum was sent    to the address of a physician, who had been charged with the    care of the child. I think it did reach its destination, and    for a while answered the purpose of keeping the wretched woman    faithful to her charge."AQUILA AND RIETI.Extracts from Margaret's and Ossoli's letters will guide us more intothe heart of this home-tragedy, so sanctified with holy hope, sweetlove, and patient heroism. They shall be introduced by a passage froma journal written many years before.    "My Child! O, Father, give me a bud on my tree of life, so scathed    by the lightning and bound by the frost! Surely a being born    wholly of my being, would not let me lie so still and cold in    lonely sadness. This is a new sorrow; for always, before, I have    wanted a superior or equal, but now it seems that only the feeling    of a parent for a child could exhaust the richness of one's soul.    All powerful Nature, how dost thou lead me into thy heart and    rebuke every factitious feeling, every thought of pride, which has    severed me from the Universe! How did I aspire to be a pure flame,    ever pointing upward on the altar! But these thoughts of    consecration, though true to the time, are false to the whole.    There needs no consecration to the wise heart for all is pervaded    by One Spirit, and the Soul of all existence is the Holy of    Holies. I thought ages would pass, before I had this parent    feeling, and then, that the desire would rise from my fulness of    being. But now it springs up in my poverty and sadness. I am well    aware that I ought not to be so happy. I do not deserve to be well    beloved in any way, far less as the mother by her child. I am too    rough and blurred an image of the Creator, to become a bestower of    life. Yet, if I refuse to be anything else than my highest self,    the true beauty will finally glow out in fulness."At what cost, were bought the blessings so long pined for! Early inthe summer of 1848, Margaret left Rome for Aquila, a small, old town,once a baronial residence, perched among the mountains of Abruzzi. Shethus sketches her retreat:--    "I am in the midst of a theatre of glorious, snow-crowned    mountains, whose pedestals are garlanded with the olive and    mulberry, and along whose sides run bridle-paths, fringed with    almond groves and vineyards. The valleys are yellow with saffron    flowers; the grain fields enamelled with the brilliant blue    corn-flower and red poppy. They are of intoxicating beauty, and    like nothing in America. The old genius of Europe has so mellowed    even the marbles here, that one cannot have the feeling of holy    virgin loneliness, as in the New World. The spirits of the dead    crowd me in most solitary places. Here and there, gleam churches    or shrines. The little town, much ruined, lies on the slope of a    hill, with the houses of the barons gone to decay, and unused    churches, over whose arched portals are faded frescoes, with the    open belfry, and stone wheel-windows, always so beautiful. Sweet    little paths lead away through the fields to convents,--one of    Passionists, another of Capuchins; and the draped figures of the    monks, pacing up and down the hills, look very peaceful. In the    churches still open, are pictures, not by great masters, but of    quiet, domestic style, which please me much, especially one of the    Virgin offering her breast to the child Jesus. There is often    sweet music in these churches; they are dressed with fresh    flowers, and the incense is not oppressive, so freely sweeps    through them the mountain breeze."Here Margaret remained but a month, while Ossoli was kept fast byhis guard duties in Rome. "_Addio, tutto caro_," she writes; "I shallreceive you with the greatest joy, when you can come. If it wereonly possible to be nearer to you! for, except the good air and thesecurity, this place does not please me." And again:--"How much Ilong to be near you! You write nothing of yourself, and this makes meanxious and sad. Dear and good! I pray for thee often, now that itis all I can do for thee. We must hope that Destiny will at lastgrow weary of persecuting. Ever thy affectionate." Meantime Ossoliwrites:--"Why do you not send me tidings of yourself, every post-day?since the post leaves Aquila three times a week. I send you journalsor letters every time the post leaves Rome. You should do the same.Take courage, and thus you will make me happier also; and you canthink how sad I must feel in not being near you, dearest, to care forall your wants."By the middle of July, Margaret could bear her loneliness no longer,and, passing the mountains, advanced to Rieti, within the frontier ofthe Papal States. Here Ossoli could sometimes visit her on a Sunday,by travelling in the night from Rome. "Do not fail to come," writesMargaret. "I shall have your coffee warm. You will arrive early, andI can see the diligence pass the bridge from my window." But nowthreatened a new trial, terrible under the circumstances, yet met withthe loving heroism that characterized all her conduct. The civic guardwas ordered to prepare for marching to Bologna. Under date of August17th, Ossoli writes:--"_Mia Cara!_ How deplorable is my state! I havesuffered a most severe struggle. If your condition were other than itis, I could resolve more easily; but, in the present moment, I cannotleave you! Ah, how cruel is Destiny! I understand well how much youwould sacrifice yourself for me, and am deeply grateful; but I cannotyet decide." Margaret is alone, without a single friend, and not onlyamong strangers, but surrounded by people so avaricious, cunning,and unscrupulous, that she has to be constantly on the watch to avoidbeing fleeced; she is very poor, and has no confidant, even in Rome,to consult with; she is ill, and fears death in the near crisis; yetthus, with true Roman greatness, she counsels her husband:--"It seems,indeed, a marvel how all things go contrary to us! That, just at thismoment, you should be called upon to go away. But do what is for yourhonor. If honor requires it, go. I will try to sustain myself. Ileave it to your judgment when to come,--if, indeed, you can ever comeagain! At least, we have had some hours of peace together, if nowit is all over. Adieu, love; I embrace thee always, and pray for thywelfare. Most affectionately, adieu."       *       *       *       *       *From this trial, however, she was spared. Pio Nono hesitated to sendthe civic guard to the north of Italy. Then Margaret writes:--"On ourown account, love, I shall be most grateful, if you are not obliged togo. But how unworthy, in the Pope! He seems now a man without a heart.And that traitor, Charles Albert! He will bear the curse of all futureages. Can you learn particulars from Milan? I feel sad for our poorfriends there; how much they must suffer! * * * I shall be much moretranquil to have you at my side, for it would be sad to die alone,without the touch of one dear hand. Still, I repeat what I said in mylast; if duty prevents you from coming, I will endeavor to takecare of myself." Again, two days later, she says:--"I feel, love, aprofound sympathy with you, but am not able to give perfectly wisecounsel. It seems to me, indeed, the worst possible moment to takeup arms, except in the cause of duty, of honor; for, with the Popeso cold, and his ministers so undecided, nothing can be well orsuccessfully done. If it is possible for you to wait for two or threeweeks, the public state will be determined,--as will also mine,--andyou can judge more calmly. Otherwise, it seems to me that I ought tosay nothing. Only, if you go, come here first. I must see you oncemore. Adieu, dear. Our misfortunes are many and unlooked for. Notoften does destiny demand a greater price for some happy moments. Yetnever do I repent of our affection; and for thee, if not for me, Ihope that life has still some good in store. Once again, adieu! MayGod give thee counsel and help, since they are not in the power of thyaffectionate Margherita."On the 5th of September, Ossoli was "at her side," and together, withglad and grateful hearts, they welcomed their boy; though the fatherwas compelled to return the next day to Rome. Even then, however, anew chapter of sorrows was opening. By indiscreet treatment, Margaretwas thrown into violent fever, and became unable to nurse her child.Her waiting maid, also, proved so treacherous, that she was forced todismiss her, and wished "never to set eyes on her more;" and thefamily, with whom she was living, displayed most detestable meanness.Thus helpless, ill, and solitary, she could not even now enjoy themother's privilege. Yet she writes cheerfully:--"My present nurse is avery good one, and I feel relieved. We must have courage but it is agreat care, alone and ignorant, to guard an infant in its first daysof life. He is very pretty for his age; and, without knowing what nameI intended giving him, the people in the house call him _Angiolino_,because he is so lovely." Again:--"He is so dear! It seems to me,among all disasters and difficulties, that if he lives and is well, hewill become a treasure for us two, that will compensate us foreverything." And yet again:--"This ---- is faithless, like the rest.Spite of all his promises, he will not bring the matter to inoculateNino, though, all about us, persons are dying with small-pox. I cannotsleep by night, and I weep by day, I am so disgusted; but you are toofar off to help me. The baby is more beautiful every hour. He is worthall the trouble he causes me,--poor child that I am,--alone here, andabused by everybody."Yet new struggles; new sorrows! Ossoli writes:--"Our affairs must be managed with the utmost caution imaginable, sincemy thought would be to keep the baby out of Rome for the sake ofgreater secrecy, if only we can find a good nurse who will take careof him like a mother." To which Margaret replies:--"He is always socharming, how can I ever, ever leave him! I wake in the night,--I lookat him. I think: Ah, it is impossible! He is so beautiful and good, Icould die for him!" Once more:--"In seeking rooms, do not pledge me toremain in Rome, for it seems to me, often, I cannot stay long withoutseeing the boy. He is so dear, and life seems so uncertain. It isnecessary that I should be in Rome a month, at least, to write, andalso to be near you. But I must be free to return here, if I feel tooanxious and suffering for him. O, love! how difficult is life! Butthou art good! If it were only possible to make thee happy!" And,finally, "Signora speaks very highly of ----, the nurse of Angelo,and says that her aunt is an excellent woman, and that the brothersare all good. Her conduct pleases me well. This consoles me a little,in the prospect of leaving my child, if that is necessary."So, early in November, Ossoli came for her, and they returnedtogether. In December, however, Margaret passed a week more with herdarling, making two fatiguing and perilous journeys, as snows hadfallen on the mountains, and the streams were much swollen by therains. And then, from the combined motives of being near her husband,watching and taking part in the impending struggle of liberalism,earning support by her pen, preparing her book, and avoidingsuspicion, she remained for three months in Rome. "How many nights Ihave passed," she writes, "entirely in contriving possible means, bywhich, through resolution and effort on my part, that one sacrificecould be avoided. But it was impossible. I could not take the nursefrom her family; I could not remove Angelo, without immense difficultyand risk. It is singular, how everything has worked to give me moreand more sorrow. Could I but have remained in peace, cherishing themessenger dove, I should have asked no more, but should have feltoverpaid for all the pains and bafflings of my sad and broken life."In March, she flies back to Rieti, and finds "our treasure in the bestof health, and plump, though small. When first I took him in my arms,he made no sound, but leaned his head against my bosom, and kept itthere, as if he would say, How could you leave me? They told me, thatall the day of my departure he would not be comforted, always lookingtoward the door. He has been a strangely precocious infant, I think,through sympathy with me, for I worked very hard before his birth,with the hope that all my spirit might be incarnated in him. Inthat regard, it may have been good for him to be with these moreinstinctively joyous natures. I see that he is more serene, is lesssensitive, than when with me, and sleeps better. The most solidhappiness I have known has been when he has gone to sleep in my arms.What cruel sacrifices have I made to guard my secret for the present,and to have the mode of disclosure at my own option! It will, indeed,be just like all the rest, if these sacrifices are made in vain."       *       *       *       *       *At Rieti, Margaret rested till the middle of April, when, returningonce more to Rome, she was, as we have seen, shut up within thebeleagured city.The siege ended, the anxious mother was free to seek her child oncemore, in his nest among the mountains. Her fears had been but tooprophetic. "Though the physician sent me reassuring letters," shewrites, "I yet often seemed to hear Angelino calling to me amid theroar of the cannon, and always his tone was of crying. And when Icame, I found mine own fast waning to the tomb! His nurse, lovely andinnocent as she appeared, had betrayed him, for lack of a few _scudi_!He was worn to a skeleton; his sweet, childish grace all gone!Everything I had endured seemed light to what I felt when I saw himtoo weak to smile, or lift his wasted little hand. Now, by incessantcare, we have brought him back,--who knows if that be a deed oflove?--into this hard world once more. But I could not let him go,unless I went with him; and I do hope that the cruel law of my lifewill, at least, not oblige us to be separated. When I saw his firstreturning smile,--that poor, wan, feeble smile!--and more than fourweeks we watched him night and day, before we saw it,--new resolutiondawned in my heart. I resolved to live, day by day, hour by hour, forhis dear sake. So, if he is only treasure lent,--if he too must go, assweet Waldo, Pickie, Hermann, did,--as all _my_ children do!--I shallat least have these days and hours with him."How intolerable was this last blow to one stretched so long on therack, is plain from Margaret's letters. "I shall never again," shewrites, "be perfectly, be religiously generous, so terribly do I needfor myself the love I have given to other sufferers. When you readthis, I hope your heart will be happy; for I still like to know thatothers are happy,--it consoles me." Again her agony wrung fromher these bitter words,--the bitterest she ever uttered,--words oftransient madness, yet most characteristic:--"Oh God! help me, isall my cry. Yet I have little faith in the Paternal love I need, soruthless or so negligent seems the government of this earth. I feelcalm, yet sternly, towards Fate. This last plot against me has beenso cruelly, cunningly wrought, that I shall never acquiesce. I submit,because useless resistance is degrading, but I demand an explanation.I see that it is probable I shall never receive one, while I livehere, and suppose I can bear the rest of the suspense, since I havecomprehended all its difficulties in the first moments. Meanwhile,I live day by day, though not on manna." But now comes a sweeter,gentler strain:--"I have been the object of great love from thenoble and the humble; I have felt it towards both. Yet I am _tiredout_,--tired of thinking and hoping,--tired of seeing men err andbleed. I take interest in some plans,--Socialism for instance,--butthe interest is shallow as the plans. These are needed, are evengood; but man will still blunder and weep, as he has done for so manythousand years. Coward and footsore, gladly would I creep into somegreen recess, where I might see a few not unfriendly faces, and wherenot more wretches should come than I could relieve. Yes! I am weary,and faith soars and sings no more. Nothing good of me is left exceptat the bottom of the heart, a melting tenderness:--'She loves much.'"CALM AFTER STORM.Morning rainbows usher in tempests, and certainly youth's romanticvisions had prefigured a stormy day of life for Margaret. But therewas yet to be a serene and glowing hour before the sun went down.Angelo grew strong and lively once more; rest and peace restored herelasticity of spirit, and extracts from various letters will show inwhat tranquil blessedness, the autumn and winter glided by. After afew weeks' residence at Rieti, the happy three journeyed on, by wayof Perugia, to Florence, where they arrived at the end of September.Thence, Margaret writes:--It was so pleasant at Perugia! The pure mountain air is such perfectelixir, the walks are so beautiful on every side, and there is so muchto excite generous and consoling feelings! I think the works of theUmbrian school are never well seen except in their home;--they sufferby comparison with works more rich in coloring, more genial, more fullof common life. The depth and tenderness of their expression is loston an observer stimulated to a point out of their range. Now, I canprize them. We went every morning to some church rich in pictures,returning at noon for breakfast. After breakfast, we went into thecountry, or to sit and read under the trees near San Pietro. Thus Iread Nicolo di' Lapi, a book unenlivened by a spark of genius, butinteresting, to me, as illustrative of Florence.Our little boy gained strength rapidly there;--every day he was ableto go out with us more. He is now full of life and gayety. We hope hewill live, and grow into a stout man yet.Our journey here was delightful;--it is the first time I have seenTuscany when the purple grape hangs garlanded from tree to tree. Wewere in the early days of the vintage: the fields were animated by menand women, some of the latter with such pretty little bare feet, andshy, soft eyes, under the round straw hat. They were beginning to cutthe vines, but had not done enough to spoil any of the beauty.Here, too, I feel better pleased than ever before. Florence seems socheerful and busy, after ruined Rome, I feel as if I could forget thedisasters of the day, for a while, in looking on the treasures sheinherits.       *       *       *       *       *To-day we have been out in the country, and found a little chapel,full of _contadine,_ their lovers waiting outside the door. Theylooked charming in their black veils,--the straw hat hanging on thearm,--with shy, glancing eyes, and cheeks pinched rosy by the cold;for it is cold here as in New England. On foot, we have explored agreat part of the environs; and till now I had no conception oftheir beauty. When here before, I took only the regular drives, asprescribed for all lady and gentlemen travellers. This evening wereturned by a path that led to the banks of the Arno. The Duomo, withthe snowy mountains, were glorious in the rosy tint and haze,just before sunset. What a difference it makes to come home to achild!--how it fills up all the gaps of life, just in the way that ismost consoling, most refreshing! Formerly, I used to feel sad at thathour; the day had not been nobly spent, I had not done my duty tomyself and others, and I felt so lonely! Now I never feel lonely; for,even if my little boy dies, our souls will remain eternally united.And I feel _infinite_ hope for him,--hope that he will serve Godand man more loyally than I have done; and, seeing how full he isof life,--how much he can afford to throw away,--I feel theinexhaustibleness of nature, and console myself for my ownincapacities.       *       *       *       *       *_Florence, Oct. 14, 1849._--Weary in spirit, with the deepdisappointments of the last year, I wish to dwell little on thesethings for the moment, but seek some consolation in the affections.My little boy is quite well now, and I often am happy in seeing howjoyous and full of activity he seems. Ossoli, too, feels happier here.The future is full of difficulties for us, but, having settled ourplans for the present, we shall set it aside while we may. "Sufficientfor the day is the evil thereof;" and if the good be not alwayssufficient, in our case it is; so let us say grace to our dinner ofherbs.       *       *       *       *       *_Florence, Nov. 7._--Dearest Mother,--Of all your endless acts andwords of love, never was any so dear to me as your last letter;--sogenerous, so sweet, so holy! What on earth is so precious as amother's love; and who has a mother like mine!I was thinking of you and my father, all that first day of October,wishing to write, only there was much to disturb me that day, as thepolice were threatening to send us away. It is only since I have hadmy own child that I have known how much I always failed to do what Imight have done for the happiness of you both; only since I haveseen so much of men and their trials, that I have learned to prize myfather as he deserved; only since I have had a heart daily and hourlytestifying to me its love, that I have understood, too late, what itwas for you to be deprived of it. It seems to me as if I had neversympathized with you as I ought, or tried to embellish and sustainyour life, as far as is possible, after such an irreparable wound.It will be sad for me to leave Italy, uncertain of return. Yet whenI think of you, beloved mother; of brothers and sisters, and manyfriends, I wish to come. Ossoli is perfectly willing. He leaves inRome a sister, whom he dearly loves. His aunt is dying now. He willgo among strangers; but to him, as to all the young Italians, Americaseems the land of liberty. He hopes, too, that a new revolution willfavor return, after a number of years, and that then he may findreally a home in Italy. All this is dark;--we can judge only for thepresent moment. The decision will rest with me, and I shall waittill the last moment, as I always do, that I may have all the reasonsbefore me.I thought, to-day, ah, if she could only be with us now! But who knowshow long this interval of peace will last? I have learned toprize such, as the halcyon prelude to the storm. It is now about afortnight, since the police gave us leave to stay, and we feel safein our little apartment. We have no servant except the nurse, withoccasional aid from the porter's wife, and now live comfortably so,tormented by no one, helping ourselves. In the evenings, we have alittle fire now;--the baby sits on his stool between us. He makes methink how I sat on mine, in the chaise, between you and father. He isexceedingly fond of flowers;--he has been enchanted, this evening, bythis splendid Gardenia, and these many crimson flowers that were givenme at Villa Correggi, where a friend took us in his carriage. It was aluxury, this ride, as we have entirely renounced the use of a carriagefor ourselves. How enchanted you would have been with that villa! Itseems now as if, with the certainty of a very limited income, we couldbe so happy! But I suppose, if we had it, one of us would die, or thebaby. Do not you die, my beloved mother;--let us together have somehalcyon moments, again, with God, with nature, with sweet childhood,with the remembrance of pure trust and good intent; away from perfidyand care, and the blight of noble designs.Ossoli wishes you were here, almost as much as I. When there isanything really lovely and tranquil, he often says, "Would not '_LaMadre_' like that?" He wept when he heard your letter. I never sawhim weep at any other time, except when his father died, and when theFrench entered Rome. He has, I think, even a more holy feeling abouta mother, from having lost his own, when very small. It has been alife-long want with him. He often shows me a little scar on his face,made by a jealous dog, when his mother was caressing him as an infant.He prizes that blemish much.       *       *       *       *       *_Florence, December_ 1, 1849.--I do not know what to write about thebaby, he changes so much,--has so many characters. He is like me inthat, for his father's character is simple and uniform, though notmonotonous, any more than are the flowers of spring flowers of thevalley. Angelino is now in the most perfect rosy health,--a very gay,impetuous, ardent, but sweet-tempered child. He seems to me to havenothing in common with his first babyhood, with its ecstatic smiles,its exquisite sensitiveness, and a distinction in the gesture andattitudes that struck everybody. His temperament is apparently changedby taking the milk of these robust women. He is now come to quite aknowing age,--fifteen months.In the morning, as soon as dressed, he signs to come into our room;then draws our curtain with his little dimpled hand, kisses me ratherviolently, pats my face, laughs, crows, shows his teeth, blows likethe bellows, stretches himself, and says "_bravo_." Then, having shownoff all his accomplishments, he expects, as a reward, to be tied inhis chair, and have his playthings. These engage him busily, but stillhe calls to us to sing and drum, to enliven the scene. Sometimes hesummons me to kiss his hand, and laughs very much at this. Enchantingis that baby-laugh, all dimples and glitter,--so strangely arch andinnocent! Then I wash and dress him. That is his great time. He makesit last as long as he can, insisting to dress and wash me the while,kicking, throwing the water about, and full of all manner of tricks,such as, I think, girls never dream of. Then comes his walk;--we havebeautiful walks here for him, protected by fine trees, always warm inmid-winter. The bands are playing in the distance, and children ofall ages are moving about, and sitting with their nurses. His walk andsleep give me about three hours in the middle of the day.I feel so refreshed by his young life, and Ossoli diffuses such apower and sweetness over every day, that I cannot endure to think yetof our future. Too much have we suffered already, trying to commandit. I do not feel force to make any effort yet. I suppose that verysoon now I must do something, and hope I shall feel able when the timecomes. My constitution seems making an effort to rally, by dint ofmuch sleep. I had slept so little, for a year and a half, and, afterthe birth of the child, I had such anxiety and anguish when separatedfrom him, that I was consumed as by nightly fever. The last twomonths at Rome would have destroyed almost any woman. Then, when Iwent to him, he was so ill, and I was constantly up with him at night,carrying him about. Now, for two months, we have been tranquil. Wehave resolved to enjoy being together as much as we can, in this briefinterval,--perhaps all we shall ever know of peace. It is very sad wehave no money, we could be so quietly happy a while. I rejoice inall Ossoli did; but the results, in this our earthly state, aredisastrous, especially as my strength is now so impaired. This much Ihope, in life or death, to be no more separated from Angelino.Last winter, I made the most vehement efforts at least to redeem thetime, hoping thus good for the future. But, of at least two volumeswritten at that time, no line seems of any worth. I had suffered muchconstraint,--much that was uncongenial, harassing, even torturing,before; but this kind of pain found me unprepared;--the position of amother separated from her only child is too frightfully unnatural.       *       *       *       *       *The Christmas holidays interest me now, through my child, as theynever did for myself. I like to go out to watch the young generationwho will be his contemporaries. On Monday, we went to the _Caseine_.After we had taken the drive, we sat down on a stone seat in the sunnywalk, to see the people pass;--the Grand Duke and his children;the elegant Austrian officers, who will be driven out of Italy whenAngelino is a man; Princess Demidoff; Harry Lorrequer; an absurd broodof fops; many lovely children; many little frisking dogs, with theirbells, &c. The sun shone brightly on the Arno; a barque moved gentlyby; all seemed good to the baby. He laid himself back in my arms,smiling, singing to himself, and dancing his feet. I hope he willretain some trace in his mind of the perpetual exhilarating picture ofItaly. It cannot but be important in its influence while yet a child,to walk in these stately gardens, full of sculpture, and hear theuntiring music of the fountains.Christmas-eve we went to the Annunziata, for midnight mass. Though theservice is not splendid here as in Rome, we yet enjoyed it;--sittingin one of the side chapels, at the foot of a monument, watchingthe rich crowds steal gently by, every eye gleaming, every gesturesoftened by the influence of the pealing choir, and the hundred silverlamps swinging their full light, in honor of the abused Emanuel.But far finest was it to pass through the Duomo. No one was there.Only the altars were lit up, and the priests, who were singing, couldnot be seen by the faint light. The vast solemnity of the interioris thus really felt. The hour was worthy of Brunelleschi. I hope hewalked there so. The Duomo is more divine than St. Peter's, and worthyof genius pure and unbroken. St. Peter's is, like Rome, a mixture ofsublimest heaven with corruptest earth. I adore the Duomo, though noplace can now be to me like St. Peter's, where has been passed thesplendidest part of my life. My feeling was always perfectly regal, onentering the piazza of St. Peter's. No spot on earth is worthier thesunlight;--on none does it fall so fondly.       *       *       *       *       *You ask me, how I employ myself here. I have been much engaged inwriting out my impressions, which will be of worth so far as correct.I am anxious only to do historical justice to facts and persons; butthere will not, so far as I am aware, be much thought, for I believeI have scarce expressed what lies deepest in my mind. I take no pains,but let the good genius guide my pen. I did long to lead a simple,natural life, _at home_, learning of my child, and writing only whenimperatively urged by the need of utterance; but when we were forcedto give up the hope of subsisting on a narrow independence, withouttie to the public, we gave up the peculiar beauty of our lives, and Istrive no more. I only hope to make good terms with the publishers.Then, I have been occupied somewhat in reading Louis Blanc's TenYears, Lamartine's Girondists, and other books of that class, whichthrow light on recent transactions.I go into society, too, somewhat, and see several delightful persons,in an intimate way. The Americans meet twice a week, at the house ofMessrs. Mozier and Chapman, and I am often present, on account ofthe friendly interest of those resident here. With our friends, theGreenoughs, I have twice gone to the opera. Then I see the Browningsoften, and love and admire them both, more and more, as I know thembetter. Mr. Browning enriches every hour I pass with him, and isa most cordial, true, and noble man. One of my most highly prizedItalian friends, also, Marchioness Arconati Visconti, of Milan, ispassing the winter here, and I see her almost every day.       *       *       *       *       *My love for Ossoli is most pure and tender, nor has any one, except mymother or little children, loved me so genuinely as he does. To some,I have been obliged to make myself known; others have loved me with amixture of fancy and enthusiasm, excited by my talent at embellishinglife. But Ossoli loves me from simple affinity;--he loves to bewith me, and to serve and soothe me. Life will probably be a severestruggle, but I hope I shall be able to live through all that isbefore us, and not neglect my child or his father. He has sufferedenough since we met;--it has ploughed furrows in his life. He hasdone all he could, and cannot blame himself. Our outward destiny looksdark, but we must brave it as we can. I trust we shall always feelmutual tenderness, and Ossoli has a simple, childlike piety, that willmake it easier for him.MARGARET AND HER PEERS.Pure and peaceful as was the joy of Margaret's Florence winter, it wasensured and perfected by the fidelity of friends, who hedged aroundwith honor the garden of her home. She had been called to pass througha most trying ordeal, and the verdict of her peers was heightenedesteem and love. With what dignified gratitude she accepted thiswell-earned proof of confidence, will appear from the followingextracts.TO MRS. E.S.Thus far, my friends have received news that must have been anunpleasant surprise to them, in a way that, _a moi_, does them greathonor. None have shown littleness or displeasure, at being denied myconfidence while they were giving their own. Many have expressed thewarmest sympathy, and only one has shown a disposition to transgressthe limit I myself had marked, and to ask questions. With her, Ithink, this was because she was annoyed by what people said, andwished to be able to answer them. I replied to her, that I hadcommunicated already all I intended, and should not go intodetail;--that when unkind things were said about me, she should letthem pass. Will you, dear E----, do the same? I am sure your affectionfor me will prompt you to add, that you feel confident whatever Ihave done has been in a good spirit, and not contrary to _my_ ideasof right. For the rest, you will not admit for me,--as I do not formyself,--the rights of the social inquisition of the United States toknow all the details of my affairs. If my mother is content; if Ossoliand I are content; if our child, when grown up, shall be content; thatis enough. You and I know enough of the United States to be sure thatmany persons there will blame whatever is peculiar. The lower-mindedpersons, everywhere, are sure to think that whatever is mysteriousmust be bad. But I think there will remain for me a sufficient numberof friends to keep my heart warm, and to help me earn my bread;--thatis all that is of any consequence. Ossoli seems to me more lovely andgood every day; our darling child is well now, and every day more gayand playful. For his sake I shall have courage; and hope some goodangel will show us the way out of our external difficulties.TO W.W.S.It was like you to receive with such kindness the news of my marriage.A less generous person would have been displeased, that, when we hadbeen drawn so together,--when we had talked so freely, and you hadshown towards me such sweet friendship,--I had not told you. Often didI long to do so, but I had, for reasons that seemed important, madea law to myself to keep this secret as rigidly as possible, up to acertain moment. That moment came. Its decisions were not such as I hadhoped; but it left me, at least, without that painful burden, whichI trust never to bear again. Nature keeps so many secrets, that Ihad supposed the moral writers exaggerated the dangers and plagues ofkeeping them; but they cannot exaggerate. All that can be said aboutmine is, that I at least acted out, with, to me, tragic thoroughness,"The wonder, a woman keeps a secret." As to my not telling _you_, Ican merely say, that I was keeping the information from my family anddearest friends at home; and, had you remained near me a very littlelater, you would have been the very first person to whom I should havespoken, as you would have been the first, on this side of the water,to whom I should have written, had I known where to address you. YetI hardly hoped for your sympathy, dear W----. I am very glad if Ihave it. May brotherly love ever be returned unto you in like measure.Ossoli desires his love and respect to be testified to you both.TO THE MARCHIONESS VISCONTI ARCONATI.Reading a book called "The Last Days of the Republic in Rome," I seethat my letter, giving my impressions of that period, may well haveseemed to you strangely partial. If we can meet as once we did,and compare notes in the same spirit of candor, while making mutualallowance for our different points of view, your testimony andopinions would be invaluable to me. But will you have patience with mydemocracy,--my revolutionary spirit? Believe that in thought I am moreradical than ever. The heart of Margaret you know,--it is always thesame. Mazzini is immortally dear to me--a thousand times deafer forall the trial I saw made of him in Rome;--dearer for all he suffered.Many of his brave friends perished there. We who, less worthy,survive, would fain make up for the loss, by our increased devotionto him, the purest, the most disinterested of patriots, the mostaffectionate of brothers. You will not love me less that I am true tohim.Then, again, how will it affect you to know that I have united mydestiny with that of an obscure young man,--younger than myself; aperson of no intellectual culture, and in whom, in short, you willsee no reason for my choosing; yet more, that this union is of longstanding; that we have with us our child, of a year old, and that itis only lately I acquainted my family with the fact?If you decide to meet with me as before, and wish to say somethingabout the matter to your friends, it will be true to declare thatthere have been pecuniary reasons for this concealment. But _toyou_, in confidence, I add, this is only half the truth; and I cannotexplain, or satisfy my dear friend further. I should wish to meether independent of all relations, but, as we live in the midst of"society," she would have to inquire for me now as Margaret Ossoli.That being done, I should like to say nothing more on the subject.However you may feel about all this, dear Madame Arconati, you willalways be the same in my eyes. I earnestly wish you may not feelestranged; but, if you do, I would prefer that you should act upon it.Let us meet as friends, or not at all. In all events, I remain everyours,MARGARET.TO THE MARCHIONESS VISCONTI ARCONATI.My loved friend,--I read your letter with greatest content. I did notknow but that there might seem something offensively strange in thecircumstances I mentioned to you. Goethe says, "There is nothing menpardon so little as singular conduct, for which no reason is given;"and, remembering this, I have been a little surprised at the evenincreased warmth of interest with which the little American society ofFlorence has received me, with the unexpected accessories of husbandand child,--asking no questions, and seemingly satisfied to find methus accompanied. With you, indeed, I thought it would be so, becauseyou are above the world; only, as you have always walked in the beatenpath, though with noble port, and feet undefiled, I thought you mightnot like your friends to be running about in these blind alleys. Itglads my heart, indeed, that you do not care for this, and that we maymeet in love.You speak of our children. Ah! dear friend, I do, indeed, feel weshall have deep sympathy there. I do not believe mine will be abrilliant child, and, indeed, I see nothing peculiar about him. Yet heis to me a source of ineffable joys,--far purer, deeper, than anythingI ever felt before,--like what Nature had sometimes given, but moreintimate, more sweet. He loves me very much; his little heart clingsto mine. I trust, if he lives, to sow there no seeds which are notgood, to be always growing better for his sake. Ossoli, too, will bea good father. He has very little of what is called intellectualdevelopment, but unspoiled instincts, affections pure and constant,and a quiet sense of duty, which, to me,--who have seen much of thegreat faults in characters of enthusiasm and genius,--seems of highestvalue.When you write by post, please direct "Marchesa Ossoli," as all theletters come to that address. I did not explain myself on that point.The fact is, it looks to me silly for a radical like me to be carryinga title; and yet, while Ossoli is in his native land, it seemsdisjoining myself from him, not to bear it. It is a sort of thing thatdoes not naturally belong to me, and, unsustained by fortune, is but a_souvenir_ even for Ossoli. Yet it has appeared to me, that for himto drop an inherited title would be, in some sort, to acquiesce inhis brothers' disclaiming him, and to abandon a right he may passivelywish to maintain for his child. How does it seem to you? I am notvery clear about it. If Ossoli should drop the title, it would bea suitable moment to do so on becoming an inhabitant of RepublicanAmerica.TO MRS. C.T.What you say of the meddling curiosity of people repels me, it is sodifferent here. When I made my appearance with a husband and a childof a year old, nobody did the least act to annoy me. All were mostcordial; none asked or implied questions. Yet there were not a few whomight justly have complained, that, when they were confiding to meall their affairs, and doing much to serve me, I had observed absolutesilence to them. Others might, for more than one reason, be displeasedat the choice I made. All have acted in the kindliest and most refinedmanner. An Italian lady, with whom I was intimate,--who might bequalified in the Court Journal, as one of the highest rank, sustainedby the most scrupulous decorum,--when I wrote, "Dear friend, I ammarried; I have a child. There are particulars, as to my reasons forkeeping this secret, I do not wish to tell. This is rather an oddaffair; will it make any difference in our relations?"--answered,"What difference can it make, except that I shall love you more, nowthat we can sympathize as mothers?" Her first visit here was to me:she adopted at once Ossoli and the child to her love.---- wrote me that ---- was a little hurt, at first, that I did nottell him, even in the trying days of Rome, but left him to hear it, ashe unluckily did, at the _table d'hote_ in Venice; but his secondand prevailing thought was regret that he had not known it, so as tosoothe and aid me,--to visit Ossoli at his post,--to go to the childin the country. Wholly in that spirit was the fine letter he wroteme, one of my treasures. The little American society have been mostcordial and attentive; one lady, who has been most intimate with me,dropped a tear over the difficulties before me, but she said, "Sinceyou have seen fit to take the step, all your friends have to do, now,is to make it as easy for you as they can."TO MRS. E.S.I am glad to have people favorably impressed, because I feel lazy andweak, unequal to the trouble of friction, or the pain of conquest.Still, I feel a good deal of contempt for those so easily disconcertedor reaessured. I was not a child; I had lived in the midst of that NewEngland society, in a way that entitled me to esteem, and a favorableinterpretation, where there was doubt about my motives or actions. Ipity those who are inclined to think ill, when they might as well haveinclined the other way. However, let them go; there are many in theworld who stand the test, enough to keep us from shivering to death. Iam, on the whole, fortunate in friends whom I can truly esteem, andin whom I know the kernel and substance of their being too well to bemisled by seemings.TO MRS. C.T.I had a letter from my mother, last summer, speaking of the fact, thatshe had never been present at the marriage of one of her children. Apang of remorse came as I read it, and I thought, if Angelino dies,[A]I will not give her the pain of knowing that I have kept this secretfrom her;--she shall hear of this connection, as if it were somethingnew. When I found he would live, I wrote to her and others. It halfkilled me to write those few letters, and yet, I know, many arewondering that I did not write more, and more particularly. My motherreceived my communication in the highest spirit. She said, she wassure a first object with me had been, now and always, to save herpain. She blessed us. She rejoiced that she should not die feelingthere was no one left to love me with the devotion she thought Ineeded. She expressed no regret at our poverty, but offered her feeblemeans. Her letter was a noble crown to her life of disinterested,purifying love.[Footnote A: This was when Margaret found Nino so ill at Rieti.]FLORENCE.The following notes respecting Margaret's residence in Florence werefurnished to the editors by Mr. W.H. Hurlbut.I passed about six weeks in the city of Florence, during the months ofMarch and April, 1850. During the whole of that time Madame Ossoli wasresiding in a house at the corner of the Via della Misericordia andthe Piazza Santa Maria Novella. This house is one of those large, wellbuilt modern houses that show strangely in the streets of the statelyTuscan city. But if her rooms were less characteristically Italian,they were the more comfortable, and, though small, had a quiet,home-like air. Her windows opened upon a fine view of the beautifulPiazza; for such was their position, that while the card-board facadeof the church of Sta. Maria Novella could only be seen at an angle,the exquisite Campanile rose fair and full against the sky. Sheenjoyed this most graceful tower very much, and, I think, preferred iteven to Giotto's noble work. Its quiet religious grace was grateful toher spirit, which seemed to be yearning for peace from the cares thathad so vexed and heated the world about her for a year past.I saw her frequently at these rooms, where, surrounded by her booksand papers, she used to devote her mornings to her literary labors.Once or twice I called in the morning, and found her quite immersedin manuscripts and journals. Her evenings were passed usually inthe society of her friends, at her own rooms, or at theirs. With thepleasant circle of Americans, then living in Florence, she was on thebest terms, and though she seemed always to bring with her her ownmost intimate society, and never to be quite free from the company ofbusy thoughts, and the cares to which her life had introduced her,she was always cheerful, and her remarkable powers of conversationsubserved on all occasions the kindliest, purposes of good-will insocial intercourse.The friends with whom she seemed to be on the terms of most sympathy,were an Italian lady, the Marchesa Arconati Visconti,[A]--theexquisite sweetness of whose voice interpreted, even to those who knewher only as a transient acquaintance, the harmony of her nature,--andsome English residents in Florence, among whom I need only name Mr.and Mrs. Browning, to satisfy the most anxious friends of MadameOssoli that the last months of her Italian life were cheered by allthe light that communion with gifted and noble natures could afford.The Marchesa Arconati used to persuade Madame Ossoli to occasionalexcursions with her into the environs of Florence, and she passed somedays of the beautiful spring weather at the villa of that lady.Her delight in nature seemed to be a source of great comfort andstrength to her. I shall not easily forget the account she gave me, onthe evening of one delicious Sunday in April, of a walk which she hadtaken with her husband in the afternoon of that day, to the hill ofSan Miniato. The amethystine beauty of the Apennines,--thecypress trees that sentinel the way up to the ancient and desertedchurch,--the church itself, standing high and lonely on its hill,begirt with the vine-clad, crumbling walls of Michel Angelo,--therepose of the dome-crowned city in the vale below,--seemed to havewrought their impression with peculiar force upon her mind thatafternoon. On their way home, they had entered the conventual churchthat stands half way up the hill, just as the vesper service wasbeginning, and she spoke of the simple spirit of devotion that filledthe place, and of the gentle wonder with which, to use her own words,the "peasant women turned their glances, the soft dark glances ofthe Tuscan peasant's eyes," upon the strangers, with a singularenthusiasm. She was in the habit of taking such walks with herhusband, and she never returned from one of them, I believe, withoutsome new impression of beauty and of lasting truth. While herjudgment, intense in its sincerity, tested, like an _aqua regia_, thevalue of all facts that came within her notice, her sympathiesseemed, by an instinctive and unerring action, to transmute all herexperiences instantly into permanent treasures.The economy of the house in which she lived afforded me occasionsfor observing the decisive power, both of control and of consolation,which she could exert over others. Her maid,--an impetuous girl ofRieti, a town which rivals Tivoli as a hot-bed of homicide,--wasconstantly involved in disputes with a young Jewess, who occupied thefloor above Madame Ossoli. On one occasion, this Jewess offered themaid a deliberate and unprovoked insult. The girl of Rieti, snatchingup a knife, ran up stairs to revenge herself after her nationalfashion. The porter's little daughter followed her and, runninginto Madame Ossoli's rooms, besought her interference. Madame Ossolireached the apartment of the Jewess, just in time to interpose betweenthat beetle-browed lady and her infuriated assailant. Those whoknow the insane license of spirit which distinguishes the Romanmountaineers, will understand that this was a position of no slighthazard. The Jewess aggravated the danger of the offence by theobstinate maliciousness of her aspect and words. Such, however, wasMadame Ossoli's entire self-possession and forbearance, that she wasable to hold her ground, and to remonstrate with this difficult pairof antagonists so effectually, as to bring the maid to penitent tears,and the Jewess to a confession of her injustice, and a promise offuture good behavior.The porter of the house, who lived in a dark cavernous hole on thefirst floor, was slowly dying of a consumption, the sufferings ofwhich were imbittered by the chill dampness of his abode. His hollowvoice and hacking cough, however, could not veil the grateful accentwith which he uttered any allusion to Madame Ossoli. He was so closea prisoner to his narrow, windowless chamber, that when I inquired forMadame Ossoli he was often obliged to call his little daughter, beforehe could tell me whether Madame was at home, or not; and he alwaystempered the official uniformity of the question with some wordof tenderness. Indeed, he rarely pronounced her name; sufficientlyindicating to the child whom it was that I was seeking, by theaffectionate epithet he used, "_Lita! e la cara Signora in casa_?"The composure and force of Madame Ossoli's character would, indeed,have given her a strong influence for good over any person with whomshe was brought into contact; but this influence must have been evenextraordinary over the impulsive and ill-disciplined children ofpassion and of sorrow, among whom she was thrown in Italy.Her husband related to me once, with a most reverent enthusiasm, somestories of the good she had done in Rieti, during her residence there.The Spanish troops were quartered in that town, and the dissipatedhabits of the officers, as well as the excesses of the soldiery, keptthe place in a constant irritation. Though overwhelmed with cares andanxieties, Madame Ossoli found time and collectedness of mind enoughto interest herself in the distresses of the towns-people, and to pourthe soothing oil of a wise sympathy upon their wounded and indignantfeelings. On one occasion, as the Marchese told me, she undoubtedlysaved the lives of a family in Rieti, by inducing them to pass overin silence an insult offered to one of them by an intoxicated Spanishsoldier,--and, on another, she interfered between two brothers,maddened by passion, and threatening to stain the family hearth withthe guilt of fratricide.[B]Such incidents, and the calm tenor of Madame Ossoli's confidenthopes.--the assured faith and unshaken bravery, with which she met andturned aside the complicated troubles, rising sometimes into absoluteperils, of their last year in Italy,--seemed to have inspired herhusband with a feeling of respect for her, amounting to reverence.This feeling, modifying the manifest tenderness with which he hungupon her every word and look, and sought to anticipate her simplestwishes, was luminously visible in the air and manner of hisaffectionate devotion to her.The frank and simple recognition of his wife's singular nobleness,which he always displayed, was the best evidence that his own naturewas of a fine and noble strain. And those who knew him best, are, Ibelieve, unanimous in testifying that his character did in no respectbelie the evidence borne by his manly and truthful countenance, toits warmth and its sincerity. He seemed quite absorbed in his wife andchild. I cannot remember ever to have found Madame Ossoli alone, onthose evenings when she remained at home. Her husband was always withher. The picture of their room rises clearly on my memory. A smallsquare room, sparingly, yet sufficiently furnished, with polishedfloor and frescoed ceiling,--and, drawn up closely before the cheerfulfire, an oval table, on which stood a monkish lamp of brass, withdepending chains that support quaint classic cups for the oliveoil. There, seated beside his wife, I was sure to find the Marchese,reading from some patriotic book, and dressed in the dark brown,red-corded coat of the Guardia Civica, which it was his melancholypleasure to wear at home. So long as the conversation could be carriedon in Italian, he used to remain, though he rarely joined in it to anyconsiderable degree; but if a number of English and American visitorscame in, he used to take his leave and go to the Cafe d'Italia,being very unwilling, as Madame Ossoli told me, to impose any seemingrestraint, by his presence, upon her friends, with whom he was unableto converse. For the same reason, he rarely remained with her atthe houses of her English or American friends, though he alwaysaccompanied her thither, and returned to escort her home.I conversed with him so little that I can hardly venture to make anyremarks on the impression which I received from his conversation,with regard to the character of his mind. Notwithstanding his generalreserve and curtness of speech, on two or three occasions he showedhimself to possess quite a quick and vivid fancy, and even a certainshare of humor. I have heard him tell stories remarkably well. Onetale, especially, which related to a dream he had in early life, abouta treasure concealed in his father's house, which was thrice repeated,and made so strong an impression on his mind as to induce him tobatter a certain panel in the library almost to pieces, in vain, butwhich received something like a confirmation from the fact, that aRoman attorney, who rented that and other rooms from the family, afterhis father's death, grew suddenly and unaccountably rich,--I rememberas being told with great felicity and vivacity of expression.His recollections of the trouble and the dangers through which hehad passed with his wife seemed to be overpoweringly painful. On oneoccasion, he began to tell me a story of their stay in the mountains:He had gone out to walk, and had unconsciously crossed theNeapolitan frontier. Suddenly meeting with a party of the Neapolitan_gendarmerie_, he was called to account for his trespass, and beingunable to produce any papers testifying to his loyalty, orthe legality of his existence, he was carried off, despite hisprotestations, and lodged for the night in a miserable guard-house,whence he-was taken, next morning, to the head-quarters of the officercommanding in the neighborhood. Here, matters might have gone badlywith him, but for the accident that he had upon his person a businessletter directed to himself as the Marchese Ossoli. A certain abbe, theregimental chaplain, having once spent some time in Rome, recognizedthe name as that of an officer in the Pope's Guardia Nobile,[C]whereupon, the Neapolitan officers not only ordered him to bereleased, but sent him back, with many apologies, in a carriage, andunder an armed escort, to the Roman territory. When he reached thispart of his story, and came to his meeting with Madame Ossoli,the remembrance of her terrible distress during the period of hisdetention so overcame him, that he was quite unable to go on.Towards their child he manifested an overflowing tenderness, and mostaffectionate care.Notwithstanding the intense contempt and hatred which Signore Ossoli,in common with all the Italian liberals, cherished towards theecclesiastical body, he seemed to be a very devout Catholic. He usedto attend regularly the vesper service, in some of the older andquieter churches of Florence; and, though I presume Madame Ossolinever accepted in any degree the Roman Catholic forms of faith, shefrequently accompanied him on these occasions. And I know that sheenjoyed the devotional influences of the church ritual, as performedin the cathedral, and at Santa Croce, especially during theEaster-week.Though condemned by her somewhat uncertain position at Florence,[D]as well as by the state of things in Tuscany at that time, to acomparative inaction, Madame Ossoli never seemed to lose in the leastthe warmth of her interest in the affairs of Italy, nor did she bateone jot of heart or hope for the future of that country. She was muchdepressed, however, I think, by the apparent apathy and prostrationof the Liberals in Tuscany; and the presence of the Austrian troops inFlorence was as painful and annoying to her, as it could have beento any Florentine patriot. When it was understood that PrinceLichtenstein had requested the Grand Duke to order a generalillumination in honor of the anniversary of the battle of Novara,Madame Ossoli, I recollect, was more moved, than I remember onany other occasion to have seen her. And she used to speak veryregretfully of the change which had come over the spirit of Florence,since her former residence there. Then all was gayety and hope. Bodiesof artisans, gathering recruits as they passed along, used to formthemselves into choral bands, as they returned from their work at theclose of the day, and filled the air with the chants of liberty. Now,all was a sombre and desolate silence.Her own various cares so occupied Madame Ossoli that she seemed to bevery much withdrawn from the world of art. During the whole time of mystay in Florence, I do not think she once visited either of the GrandDucal Galleries, and the only studio in which she seemed to feel anyvery strong interest, was that of Mademoiselle Favand, a lady whoseindependence of character, self-reliance, and courageous genius, couldhardly have failed to attract her congenial sympathies.But among all my remembrances of Madame Ossoli, there are none morebeautiful or more enduring than those which recall to me anotherperson, a young stranger, alone and in feeble health, who found, inher society, her sympathy, and her counsels, a constant atmosphere ofcomfort and of peace. Every morning, wild-flowers, freshly gathered,were laid upon her table by the grateful hands of this young man;every evening, beside her seat in her little room, his mild, pure facewas to be seen, bright with a quiet happiness, that must have boundhis heart by no weak ties to her with whose fate his own was soclosely to be linked.And the recollection of such benign and holy influences breathed uponthe human hearts of those who came within her sphere, will not, Itrust, be valueless to those friends, in whose love her memory isenshrined with more immortal honors than the world can give or takeaway.[Footnote A: Just before I left Florence, Madame Ossoli showed me asmall marble figure of a child, playing among flowers or vine leaves,which, she said, was a portrait of the child of Madame Arconati,presented to her by that lady. I mention this circumstance, because Ihave understood that a figure answering this description was recoveredfrom the wreck of the Elizabeth.][Footnote B: The circumstances of this story, perhaps, deserve tobe recorded. The brothers were two young men, the sons and thechief supports of Madame Ossoli's landlord at Rieti. They were bothmarried,--the younger one to a beautiful girl, who had brought him nodowry, and who, in the opinion of her husband's family, had not showna proper disposition to bear her share of the domestic burdens andduties. The bickerings and disputes which resulted from this stateof affairs, on one unlucky day, took the form of an open and violentquarrel. The younger son, who was absent from home when the conflictbegan, returned to find it at its height, and was received by his wifewith passionate tears, and by his relations with sharp recriminations.His brother, especially, took it upon himself to upbraid him, in thename of all his family, for bringing into their home-circle such afirebrand of discord. Charges and counter charges followed in rapidsuccession, and hasty words soon led to blows. From blows the appealto the knife was swiftly made, and when Madame Ossoli, attracted bythe unusual clamor, entered upon the scene of action, she found thatblood had been already drawn, and that the younger brother was onlyrestrained from following up the first assault by the united force ofall the females, who hung about him, while the older brother, graspinga heavy billet of wood, and pale with rage, stood awaiting hisantagonist. Passing through the group of weeping and terrified women,Madame Ossoli made her way up to the younger brother and, laying herhand upon his shoulder, asked him to put down his weapon and listen toher. It was in vain that he attempted to ignore her presence. Beforethe spell of her calm, firm, well-known voice, his fury melted away.She spoke to him again, and besought him to show himself a man, andto master his foolish and wicked rage. With a sudden impulse, he flunghis knife upon the ground, turned to Madame Ossoli, clasped and kissedher hand, and then running towards his brother, the two met in afraternal embrace, which brought the threatened tragedy to a joyfultermination.][Footnote C: It will be understood, that this officer was theMarchese's older brother, who still adheres to the Papal cause.][Footnote D: She believed herself to be, and I suppose reallywas, under the surveillance of the police during her residence inFlorence.]HOMEWARD.BY W.H.

PETRARCA.IX.HOMEWARDSPRING-TIME.Spring, bright prophet of God's eternal youth, herald forevereloquent of heaven's undying joy, has once more wrought its miracle ofresurrection on the vineyards and olive-groves of Tuscany, and touchedwith gently-wakening fingers the myrtle and the orange in the gardensof Florence. The Apennines have put aside their snowy winding-sheet,and their untroubled faces salute with rosy gleams of promise the newday, while flowers smile upward to the serene sky amid the grass andgrain fields, and fruit is swelling beneath the blossoms along theplains of Arno. "The Italian spring," writes Margaret, "is as good asParadise. Days come of glorious sunshine and gently-flowing airs, thatexpand the heart and uplift the whole nature. The birds are twitteringtheir first notes of love; the ground is enamelled with anemones,cowslips, and crocuses; every old wall and ruin puts on its festoonand garland; and the heavens stoop daily nearer, till the earth isfolded in an embrace of light, and her every pulse beats music.""This world is indeed a sad place, despite its sunshine, birds, andcrocuses. But I never felt as happy as now, when I always find theglad eyes of my little boy to welcome me. I feel the tie between himand me so real and deep-rooted, that even death shall not part us. Sosweet is this unimpassioned love, it knows no dark reactions, itdoes not idealize, and cannot be daunted by the faults of its object.Nothing but a child can take the worst bitterness out of life, andbreak the spell of loneliness. I shall not be alone in other worlds,whenever Eternity may call me."And now her face is turned homeward. "I am homesick," she had writtenyears before, "but where is that HOME?"OMENS.  "My heart is very tired,--my strength is low,--  My hands are full of blossoms plucked before,  Held dead within them till myself shall die."  ELIZABETH BARRETT.Many motives drew Margaret to her native land: heart-weariness at thereaction in Europe; desire of publishing to best advantage the bookwhereby she hoped at once to do justice to great principles and bravemen, and to earn bread for her dear ones and herself; and, above all,yearning to be again among her family and earliest associates. "Igo back," she writes, "prepared for difficulties; but it will be aconsolation to be with my mother, brothers, sister, and old friends,and I find it imperatively necessary to be in the United States, fora while at least, to make such arrangements with the printers as mayfree me from immediate care. I did think, at one time, of coming alonewith Angelino, and then writing for Ossoli to come later, or returningto Italy; knowing that it will be painful for him to go, and thatthere he must have many lonely hours. But he is separated from his oldemployments and natural companions, while no career is open for him atpresent. Then, I would not take his child away for several months; forhis heart is fixed upon him as fervently as mine. And, again, it wouldnot only be very strange and sad to be so long without his loveand care, but I should be continually solicitous about his welfare.Ossoli, indeed, cannot but feel solitary at first, and I am much moreanxious about his happiness than my own. Still, he will have our boy,and the love of my family, especially of my mother, to cheer him, andquiet communings with nature give him pleasure so simple and profound,that I hope he will make a new life for himself, in our unknowncountry, till changes favor our return to his own. I trust, that weshall find the means to come together, and to remain together."Considerations of economy determined them, spite of many misgivings,to take passage in a merchantman from Leghorn. "I am suffering," shewrites, "as never before, from the horrors of indecision. Happythe fowls of the air, who do not have to think so much about theirarrangements! The barque _Elizabeth_ will take us, and is said to bean uncommonly good vessel, nearly new, and well kept. We may be twomonths at sea, but to go by way of France would more than double theexpense. Yet, now that I am on the point of deciding to come in her,people daily dissuade me, saying that I have no conception of whata voyage of sixty or seventy days will be in point of fatigueand suffering; that the insecurity, compared with packet-ships orsteamers, is great; that the cabin, being on deck, will be terriblyexposed, in case of a gale, &c., &c. I am well aware of the pronenessof volunteer counsellors to frighten and excite one, and havegenerally disregarded them. But this time I feel a tremblingsolicitude on account of my child, and am doubtful, harassed, almostill." And again, under date of April 21, she says: "I had intended,if I went by way of France, to take the packet-ship _'Argo_,' fromHavre; and I had requested Mrs. ---- to procure and forward to me someof my effects left at Paris, in charge of Miss F----, when, takingup _Galignani_, my eye fell on these words: 'Died, 4th of April, MissF----; 'and, turning the page, I read, 'The wreck of the _Argo_,'--asomewhat singular combination! There were notices, also, of the lossof the fine English steamer _Adelaide_, and of the American packet_John Skiddy._ Safety is not to be secured, then, by the wisestforesight. I shall embark more composedly in our merchant-ship,praying fervently, indeed, that it may not be my lot to lose my boyat sea, either by unsolaced illness, or amid the howling waves; or, ifso, that Ossoli, Angelo, and I may go together, and that the anguishmay be brief."Their state-rooms were taken, their trunks packed, their preparationsfinished, they were just leaving Florence, when letters came, which,had they reached her a week earlier, would probably have induced themto remain in Italy. But Margaret had already by letter appointed arendezvous for the scattered members of her family in July; and shewould not break her engagements with the commander of the barque. Itwas destined that they were to sail,--to sail in the _Elizabeth_, tosail then. And, even in the hour of parting, clouds, whose tops weregolden in the sunshine, whose base was gloomy on the waters, beckonedthem onward. "Beware of the sea," had been a singular prophecy, givento Ossoli when a boy, by a fortune-teller, and this was the first shiphe had ever set his foot on. More than ordinary apprehensions of risk,too, hovered before Margaret. "I am absurdly fearful," she writes,"and various omens have combined to give me a dark feeling. I ambecome indeed a miserable coward, for the sake of Angelino. I fearheat and cold, fear the voyage, fear biting poverty. I hope I shallnot be forced to be as brave for him, as I have been for myself, andthat, if I succeed to rear him, he will be neither a weak nor a badman. But I love him too much! In case of mishap, however, I shallperish with my husband and my child, and we may be transferred tosome happier state." And again: "I feel perfectly willing to stay mythreescore years and ten, if it be thought I need so much tuition fromthis planet; but it seems to me that my future upon earth will soonclose. It may be terribly trying, but it will not be so very long,now. God will transplant the root, if he wills to rear it intofruit-bearing." And, finally: "I have a vague expectation of somecrisis,--I know not what. But it has long seemed, that, in the year1850, I should stand on a plateau in the ascent of life, where Ishould be allowed to pause for a while, and take more clear andcommanding views than ever before. Yet my life proceeds as regularlyas the fates of a Greek tragedy, and I can but accept the pages asthey turn." * *       *       *       *       *       *These were her parting words:--    "_Florence, May 14, 1850._--I will believe, I shall be welcome    with my treasures,--my husband and child. For me, I long so much    to see you! Should anything hinder our meeting upon earth, think    of your daughter, as one who always wished, at least, to do her    duty, and who always cherished you, according as her mind opened    to discover excellence.    "Give dear love, too, to my brothers; and first to my eldest,    faithful friend! Eugene; a sister's love to Ellen; love to my kind    and good aunts, and to my dear cousin. E.,--God bless them!    "I hope we shall be able to pass some time together yet, in this    world. But, if God decrees otherwise,--here and HEREAFTER,--my    dearest mother,    "Your loving child, MARGARET."THE VOYAGE.[A]The seventeenth of May, the day of sailing, came, and the _Elizabeth_lay waiting for her company. Yet, even then, dark presentimentsso overshadowed Margaret, that she passed one anxious hour more inhesitation, before she could resolve to go on board. But Captain Hastywas so fine a model of the New England seaman, strong-minded, prompt,calm, decided, courteous; Mrs. Hasty was so refined, gentle, andhospitable; both had already formed so warm an attachment for thelittle family, in their few interviews at Florence and Leghorn;Celeste Paolini, a young Italian girl, who had engaged to renderkindly services to Angelino, was so lady-like and pleasing; their onlyother fellow-passenger, Mr. Horace Sumner, of Boston, was so obligingand agreeable a friend; and the good ship herself looked so trim,substantial, and cheery, that it seemed weak and wrong to turn back.They embarked; and, for the first few days, all went prosperously,till fear was forgotten. Soft breezes sweep them tranquilly over thesmooth bosom of the Mediterranean; Angelino sits among his heaps oftoys, or listens to the seraphine, or leans his head with fondlinghands upon the white goat, who is now to be his foster-parent, or inthe captain's arms moves to and fro, gazing curiously at spars andrigging, or watches with delight the swelling canvass; while, underthe constant stars, above the unresting sea, Margaret and Ossolipace the deck of their small ocean-home, and think of storms leftbehind,--perhaps of coming tempests.But now Captain Hasty fell ill with fever, could hardly drag himselffrom his state-room to give necessary orders, and lay upon the bed orsofa, in fast-increased distress, though glad to bid Nino good-day, tokiss his cheek, and pat his hand. Still, the strong man grew weaker,till he could no longer draw from beneath the pillow his daily friend,the Bible, though his mind was yet clear to follow his wife's voice,as she read aloud the morning and evening chapter. But alas for thebrave, stout seaman! alas for the young wife, on almost her firstvoyage! alas for crew! alas for company! alas for the friends ofMargaret! The fever proved to be confluent small-pox, in the mostmalignant form. The good commander had received his release fromearthly duty. The _Elizabeth_ must lose her guardian. With calmcon-[Transcriber's note: A word appears to be missing here.]authorities refused permission for any one to land, and directed thatthe burial should be made at sea. As the news spread through the port,the ships dropped their flags half-mast, and at sunset, towed by theboat of a neighboring frigate, the crew of the _Elizabeth_ bore thebody of their late chief, wrapped in the flag of his nation, to itsrest in deep water. Golden twilight flooded the western sky, andshadows of high-piled clouds lay purple on the broad Atlantic. In thatcalm, summer sunset funeral, what eye foresaw the morning of horror,of which it was the sad forerunner?At Gibraltar, they were detained a week by adverse winds, but, on the9th of June, set sail again. The second day after, Angelino sickenedwith the dreadful malady, and soon became so ill, that his life wasdespaired of. His eyes were closed, his head and face swollen out ofshape, his body covered with eruption. Though inexperienced in thedisease, the parents wisely treated their boy with cooling drinks, andwet applications to the skin; under their incessant care, the feverabated, and, to their unspeakable joy, he rapidly recovered. Soberedand saddened, they could again hope, and enjoy the beauty of the calmsky and sea. Once more Nino laughs, as he splashes in his morningbath, and playfully prolongs the meal, which the careful father hasprepared with his own hand, or, if he has been angered, rests his headupon his mother's breast, while his palm is pressed against her cheek,as, bending down, she sings to him; once more, he sits among his toys,or fondles and plays with the white-haired goat, or walks up and downin the arms of the steward, who has a boy of just his age, at home,now waiting to embrace him; or among the sailors, with whom he is auniversal favorite, prattles in baby dialect as he tries to imitatetheir cry, to work the pumps, and pull the ropes. Ossoli and Sumner,meanwhile, exchange alternate lessons in Italian and English. AndMargaret, among her papers, gives the last touches to her book onItaly, or with words of hope and love comforts like a mother theheart-broken widow. Slowly, yet peacefully, pass the long summer days,the mellow moonlit nights; slowly, and with even flight, the goodElizabeth, under gentle airs from the tropics, bears them safelyonward. Four thousand miles of ocean lie behind; they are nearly home.THE WRECK.  "There are blind ways provided, the foredone  Heart-weary player in this pageant world  Drops out by, letting the main masque defile  By the conspicuous portal:--I am through,  Just through."  BROWNING.On Thursday, July 18th, at noon, the Elizabeth was off the Jerseycoast, somewhere between Cape May and Barnegat; and, as the weatherwas thick, with a fresh breeze blowing from the east of south,the officer in command, desirous to secure a good offing, stoodeast-north-east. His purpose was, when daylight showed the highlandsof Neversink, to take a pilot, and run before the wind past SandyHook. So confident, indeed, was he of safety, that he promised hispassengers to land them early in the morning at New York. With thishope, their trunks were packed, the preparations made to greet theirfriends, the last good-night was spoken, and with grateful heartsMargaret and Ossoli put Nino to rest, for the last time, as theythought, on ship-board,--for the last time, as it was to be, on earth!By nine o'clock, the breeze rose to a gale, which every hour increasedin violence, till at midnight it became a hurricane. Yet, as theElizabeth was new and strong, and as the commander, trusting to anoccasional cast of the lead, assured them that they were not nearingthe Jersey coast,--which alone he dreaded,--the passengers remained intheir state-rooms, and caught such uneasy sleep as the howling stormand tossing ship permitted. Utterly unconscious, they were, even then,amidst perils, whence only by promptest energy was it possible toescape. Though under close-reefed sails, their vessel was making wayfar more swiftly than any one on board had dreamed of; and for hours,with the combined force of currents and the tempest, had been drivingheadlong towards the sand-bars of Long Island. About four o'clock, onFriday morning, July 19th, she struck,--first draggingly, then hardand harder,--on Fire Island beach.The main and mizzen masts were at once cut away; but the heavy marblein her hold had broken through her bottom, and she bilged. Her bowheld fast, her stern swung round, she careened inland, her broadsidewas bared to the shock of the billows, and the waves made a clearbreach over her with every swell. The doom of the poor Elizabeth wassealed now, and no human power could save her. She lay at the mercy ofthe maddened ocean.At the first jar, the passengers, knowing but too well its fatalimport, sprang from their berths. Then came the cry of "Cut away,"followed by the crash of falling timbers, and the thunder of the seas,as they broke across the deck. In a moment more, the cabin skylightwas dashed in pieces by the breakers, and the spray, pouring down likea cataract, put out the lights, while the cabin door was wrenched fromits fastenings, and the waves swept in and out. One scream, one only,was heard from Margaret's state-room; and Sumner and Mrs. Hasty,meeting in the cabin, clasped hands, with these few but touchingwords: "We must die." "Let us die calmly, then." "I hope so, Mrs.Hasty." It was in the gray dusk, and amid the awful tumult, that thecompanions in misfortune met. The side of the cabin to the leeward hadalready settled under water; and furniture, trunks, and fragments ofthe skylight were floating to and fro; while the inclined position ofthe floor made it difficult to stand; and every sea, as it brokeover the bulwarks, splashed in through the open roof. The windwardcabin-walls, however, still yielded partial shelter, and against it,seated side by side, half leaning backwards, with feet braced uponthe long table, they awaited what next should come. At first. Nino,alarmed at the uproar, the darkness, and the rushing water, whileshivering with the wet, cried passionately; but soon his mother,wrapping him in such garments as were at hand and folding him to herbosom, sang him to sleep. Celeste too was in an agony of terror, tillOssoli, with soothing words and a long and fervent prayer, restoredher to self-control and trust. Then calmly they rested, side by side,exchanging kindly partings and sending messages to friends, if anyshould survive to be their bearer. Meanwhile, the boats having beenswamped or carried away, and the carpenter's tools washed overboard,the crew had retreated to the top-gallant forecastle; but, as thepassengers saw and heard nothing of them, they supposed that theofficers and crew had deserted the ship, and that they were leftalone. Thus passed three hours.At length, about seven, as there were signs that the cabin would soonbreak up, and any death seemed preferable to that of being crushedamong the ruins, Mrs. Hasty made her way to the door, and, lookingout at intervals between the seas as they swept across the vesselamidships, saw some one standing by the foremast. His face was towardthe shore. She screamed and beckoned, but her voice was lost amid theroar of the wind and breakers, and her gestures were unnoticed. Soon,however, Davis, the mate, through the door of the forecastle caughtsight of her, and, at once comprehending the danger, summoned the mento go to the rescue. At first none dared to risk with him the perilousattempt; but, cool and resolute, he set forth by himself, and nowholding to the bulwarks, now stooping as the waves combed over,he succeeded in reaching the cabin. Two sailors, emboldened by hisexample, followed. Preparations were instantly made to conduct thepassengers to the forecastle, which, as being more strongly built andlying further up the sands, was the least exposed part of the ship.Mrs. Hasty volunteered to go the first. With one hand clasped byDavis, while with the other each grasped the rail, they started, asailor moving close behind. But hardly had they taken three steps,when a sea broke loose her hold, and swept her into the hatch-way."Let me go," she cried, "your life is important to all on board."But cheerily, and with a smile,[B] he answered, "Not quite yet;" and,seizing in his teeth her long hair, as it floated past him, he caughtwith both hands at some near support, and, aided by the seaman, sether once again upon her feet. A few moments more of struggle broughtthem safely through. In turn, each of the passengers was helped thuslaboriously across the deck, though, as the broken rail and cordagehad at one place fallen in the way, the passage was dangerous anddifficult in the extreme. Angelino was borne in a canvas bag,slung round the neck of a sailor. Within the forecastle, which wascomparatively dry and sheltered, they now seated themselves, and,wrapped in the loose overcoats of the seamen, regained some warmth.Three times more, however, the mate made his way to the cabin; once,to save her late husband's watch, for Mrs. Hasty; again for somedoubloons, money-drafts, and rings in Margaret's desk; and, finally,to procure a bottle of wine and a drum of figs for their refreshment.It was after his last return, that Margaret said to Mrs. Hasty,"There still remains what, if I live, will be of more value to me thananything," referring, probably, to her manuscript on Italy; but itseemed too selfish to ask their brave preserver to run the risk again.There was opportunity now to learn their situation, and to discussthe chances of escape. At the distance of only a few hundred yards,appeared the shore,--a lonely waste of sand-hills, so far as couldbe seen through the spray and driving rain. But men had been earlyobserved, gazing at the wreck, and, later, a wagon had been drawnupon the beach. There was no sign of a life-boat, however, or of anyattempt at rescue; and, about nine o'clock, it was determined thatsome one should try to land by swimming, and, if possible, get help.Though it seemed almost sure death to trust one's self to the surf, asailor, with a life-preserver, jumped overboard, and, notwithstandinga current drifting him to leeward, was seen to reach the shore.A second, with the aid of a spar, followed in safety; and Sumner,encouraged by their success, sprang over also; but, either struck bysome piece of the wreck, or unable to combat with the waves, he sank.Another hour or more passed by; but though persons were busy gatheringinto carts whatever spoil was stranded, no life-boat yet appeared;and, after much deliberation, the plan was proposed,--and, as it wasthen understood, agreed to,--that the passengers should attempt toland, each seated upon a plank, and grasping handles of rope, whilea sailor swam behind. Here, too, Mrs. Hasty was the first to venture,under the guard of Davis. Once and again, during their passage, theplank was rolled wholly over, and once and again was righted, with itsbearer, by the dauntless steersman; and when, at length, tossed bythe surf upon the sands, the half-drowned woman still holding, as ina death-struggle, to the ropes, was about to be swept back by theundertow, he caught her in his arms, and, with the assistance of abystander, placed her high upon the beach. Thus twice in one day hadhe perilled his own life to save that of the widow of his captain,and even over that dismal tragedy his devotedness casts one gleam oflight.Now came Margaret's turn. But she steadily refused to be separatedfrom Ossoli and Angelo. On a raft with them, she would have boldlyencountered the surf, but alone she would not go. Probably, she hadappeared to assent to the plan for escaping upon planks, with the viewof inducing Mrs. Hasty to trust herself to the care of the best man onboard; very possibly, also, she had never learned the result of theirattempt, as, seated within the forecastle, she could not see thebeach. She knew, too, that if a life-boat could be sent, Davis was onewho would neglect no effort to expedite its coming. While she wasyet declining all persuasions, word was given from the deck, thatthe life-boat had finally appeared. For a moment, the news lighted upagain the flickering fire of hope. They might yet be saved,--be savedtogether! Alas! to the experienced eyes of the sailors it too soonbecame evident that there was no attempt to launch or man her. Thelast chance of aid from shore, then, was gone utterly. They must relyon their own strength, or perish. And if ever they were to escape,the time had come; for, at noon, the storm had somewhat lulled; butalready the tide had turned, and it was plain that the wreck could nothold together through another flood. In this emergency, the commandingofficer, who until now had remained at his post, once more appealedto Margaret to try to escape,--urging that the ship would inevitablybreak up soon; that it was mere suicide to remain longer; that he didnot feel free to sacrifice the lives of the crew, or to throw awayhis own; finally, that he would himself take Angelo, and that sailorsshould go with Celeste, Ossoli, and herself. But, as before, Margaretdecisively declared that she would not be parted from her husband orher child. The order was then given to "save themselves," and allbut four of the crew jumped over, several of whom, together with thecommander, reached shore alive, though severely bruised and wounded bythe drifting fragments. There is a sad consolation in believing that,if Margaret judged it to be impossible that the _three_ should escape,she in all probability was right. It required a most rare, combinationof courage, promptness and persistency, to do what Davis had donefor Mrs. Hasty. We may not conjecture the crowd of thoughts whichinfluenced the lovers, the parents, in this awful crisis; butdoubtless one wish was ever uppermost,--that, God willing, the lasthour might come for ALL, if it must come for _one_.It was now past three o'clock, and as, with the rising tide, the galeswelled once more to its former violence, the remnants of the barquefast yielded to the resistless waves. The cabin went by the board, theafter-parts broke up, and the stem settled out of sight. Soon, too,the forecastle was filled with water, and the helpless little bandwere driven to the deck, where they clustered round the foremast.Presently, even this frail support was loosened from the hull, androse and fell with every billow. It was plain to all that the finalmoment drew swiftly nigh. Of the four seamen who still stood by thepassengers, three were as efficient as any among the crew of theElizabeth. These were the steward, carpenter, and cook. The fourth wasan old sailor, who, broken down by hardships and sickness, was goinghome to die. These men were once again persuading Margaret, Ossoliand Celeste to try the planks, which they held ready in the lee ofthe ship, and the steward, by whom Nino was so much beloved, had justtaken the little fellow in his arms, with the pledge that he wouldsave him or die, when a sea struck the forecastle, and the foremastfell, carrying with it the deck, and all upon it. The steward andAngelino were washed upon the beach, both dead, though warm, sometwenty minutes after. The cook and carpenter were thrown far upon theforemast, and saved themselves by swimming. Celeste and Ossoli caughtfor a moment by the rigging, but the next wave swallowed them up.Margaret sank at once. When last seen, she had been seated at the footof the foremast, still clad in her white night-dress, with her hairfallen loose upon her shoulders. It was over,--that twelve hours'communion, face to face, with Death! It was over! and the prayer wasgranted, "that Ossoli, Angelo, and I, may go together, and that theanguish may be brief!"       *       *       *       *       *A passage from the journal of a friend of Margaret, whom the newsof the wreck drew at once to the scene, shall close this mournfulstory:--    "The hull of the Elizabeth, with the foremast still bound to    it by cordage, lies so near the shore, that it seems as if    a dozen oar-strokes would carry a boat alongside. And as one    looks at it glittering in the sunshine, and rocking gently in    the swell, it is hard to feel reconciled to our loss. Seven    resolute men might have saved every soul on board. I know how    different was the prospect on that awful morning, when the    most violent gale that had visited our coast for years, drove    the billows up to the very foot of the sand-hills, and when    the sea in foaming torrents swept across the beach into the    bay behind. Yet I cannot but reluctantly declare my judgment,    that this terrible tragedy is to be attributed, so far    as human agency is looked at, to our wretched system, or    _no-system_, of life-boats. The life-boat at Fire Island    light-house, three miles distant only, was not brought to the    beach till between twelve and one o'clock, more than eight    hours after the Elizabeth was stranded, and more than six    hours after the wreck could easily have been seen. When    the life-boat did finally come, the beachmen could not be    persuaded to launch or man her. And even the mortar, by which    a rope could and should have been thrown on board, was not    once fired. A single lesson like this might certainly suffice    to teach the government, insurance companies, and humane    societies, the urgent need, that to every life-boat should    be attached ORGANIZED CREWS, stimulated to do their work    faithfully, by ample pay for actual service, generous    salvage-fees for cargoes and persons, and a pension to    surviving friends where life is lost. * * *    "No trace has yet been found of Margaret's manuscript on    Italy, though the denials of the wreckers as to having seen    it, are not in the least to be depended on. For, greedy    after richer spoil, they might well have overlooked a mass of    written paper; and, even had they kept it, they would be slow    to give up what would so clearly prove their participation    in the heartless robbery, that is now exciting such universal    horror and indignation. Possibly it was washed away before    reaching the shore, as several of the trunks, it is said, were    open and empty, when thrown upon the beach. But it is sad to    think, that very possibly the brutal hands of pirates may have    tossed to the winds, or scattered on the sands, pages so rich    with experience and life. The only papers of value saved, were    the love-letters of Margaret and Ossoli.[C]    "It is a touching coincidence, that the only one of Margaret's    treasures which reached the shore, was the lifeless form of    Angelino. When the body, stripped of every rag by the waves,    was rescued from the surf, a sailor took it reverently in    his arms, and, wrapping it in his neckcloth, bore it to the    nearest house. There, when washed, and dressed in a child's    frock, found in Margaret's trunk, it was laid upon a bed; and    as the rescued seamen gathered round their late playfellow and    pet, there were few dry eyes in the circle. Several of them    mourned for Nino, as if he had been their own; and even the    callous wreckers were softened, for the moment, by a sight    so full of pathetic beauty. The next day, borne upon their    shoulders in a chest, which one of the sailors gave for a    coffin, it was buried in a hollow among the sand heaps. As I    stood beside the lonely little mound, it seemed that never    was seen a more affecting type of orphanage. Around, wiry    and stiff, were scanty spires of beach-grass; near by,    dwarf-cedars, blown flat by wintry winds, stood like grim    guardians; only at the grave-head a stunted wild-rose, wilted    and scraggy, was struggling for existence. Thoughts came    of the desolate childhood of many a little one in this hard    world; and there was joy in the assurance, that Angelo was    neither motherless nor fatherless, and that Margaret and    her husband were not childless in that New World, which so    suddenly they had entered together.    "To-morrow, Margaret's mother, sister, and brothers will    remove Nino's body to New England."       *       *       *       *       *Was this, then, thy welcome home? A howling hurricane, the pitilesssea, wreck on a sand-bar, an idle life-boat, beach-pirates, and notone friend! In those twelve hours of agony, did the last scene appearbut as the fitting close for a life of storms, where no safe havenwas ever in reach; where thy richest treasures were so often stranded;where even the dearest and nearest seemed always too far off, or justtoo late, to help.Ah, no! not so. The clouds were gloomy on the waters, truly; but theirtops were golden in the sun. It was in the Father's House that welcomeawaited thee.

Two strangers appear on the scene,and some have fancied that in the second they have again the first, whoreturns in a new guise. Why this should be we cannot tell; unless thereis a feeling that a man should not appear upon the scene, and thendisappear, leaving behind him no more substantial trace than a merebook; that he should return later on as husband or lover, to fill somemore important part than that of the mere stimulator of thought.Human life may be painted according to two methods. There is the stagemethod. According to that each character is duly marshalled at first,and ticketed; we know with an immutable certainty that at the rightcrises each one will reappear and act his part, and, when the curtainfalls, all will stand before it bowing. There is a sense of satisfactionin this, and of completeness. But there is another method--the method ofthe life we all lead. Here nothing can be prophesied. There is a strangecoming and going of feet. Men appear, act and re-act upon each other,and pass away. When the crisis comes the man who would fit it does notreturn. When the curtain falls no one is ready. When the footlights arebrightest they are blown out; and what the name of the play is no oneknows. If there sits a spectator who knows, he sits so high that theplayers in the gaslight cannot hear his breathing. Life may be paintedaccording to either method; but the methods are different. The canons ofcriticism that bear upon the one cut cruelly upon the other.It has been suggested by a kind critic that he would better have likedthe little book if it had been a history of wild adventure; of cattledriven into inaccessible kranzes by Bushmen; "of encounters withravening lions, and hair-breadth escapes." This could not be. Such worksare best written in Piccadilly or in the Strand: there the gifts of thecreative imagination, untrammelled by contact with any fact, may spreadtheir wings.But, should one sit down to paint the scenes among which he has grown,he will find that the facts creep in upon him. Those brilliant phasesand shapes which the imagination sees in far-off lands are not for himto portray. Sadly he must squeeze the colour from his brush, and dip itinto the gray pigments around him. He must paint what lies before him.R. Iron.     "We must see the first images which the external world casts     upon the dark mirror of his mind; or must hear the first     words which awaken the sleeping powers of thought, and stand     by his earliest efforts, if we would understand the     prejudices, the habits, and the passions that will rule his     life.  The entire man is, so to speak, to be found in the     cradle of the child."

Shadows From Child-Life.The Watch.The full African moon poured down its light from the blue sky into thewide, lonely plain. The dry, sandy earth, with its coating of stuntedkaroo bushes a few inches high, the low hills that skirted the plain,the milk-bushes with their long finger-like leaves, all were touched bya weird and an almost oppressive beauty as they lay in the white light.In one spot only was the solemn monotony of the plain broken. Near thecentre a small solitary kopje rose. Alone it lay there, a heap of roundironstones piled one upon another, as over some giant's grave. Here andthere a few tufts of grass or small succulent plants had sprung up amongits stones, and on the very summit a clump of prickly-pears lifted theirthorny arms, and reflected, as from mirrors, the moonlight on theirbroad fleshy leaves. At the foot of the kopje lay the homestead.First, the stone-walled sheep kraals and Kaffer huts; beyond them thedwelling-house--a square, red-brick building with thatched roof. Even onits bare red walls, and the wooden ladder that led up to the loft, themoonlight cast a kind of dreamy beauty, and quite etherealized the lowbrick wall that ran before the house, and which inclosed a bare patch ofsand and two straggling sunflowers. On the zinc roof of the great openwagon-house, on the roofs of the outbuildings that jutted from its side,the moonlight glinted with a quite peculiar brightness, till it seemedthat every rib in the metal was of burnished silver.Sleep ruled everywhere, and the homestead was not less quiet than thesolitary plain.In the farmhouse, on her great wooden bedstead, Tant Sannie, theBoer-woman, rolled heavily in her sleep.She had gone to bed, as she always did, in her clothes, and the nightwas warm and the room close, and she dreamed bad dreams. Not of theghosts and devils that so haunted her waking thoughts; not of her secondhusband the consumptive Englishman, whose grave lay away beyond theostrich-camps, nor of her first, the young Boer; but only of the sheep'strotters she had eaten for supper that night. She dreamed that one stuckfast in her throat, and she rolled her huge form from side to side, andsnorted horribly.In the next room, where the maid had forgotten to close the shutter, thewhite moonlight fell in in a flood, and made it light as day. There weretwo small beds against the wall. In one lay a yellow-haired child, witha low forehead and a face of freckles; but the loving moonlight hiddefects here as elsewhere, and showed only the innocent face of a childin its first sweet sleep.The figure in the companion bed belonged of right to the moonlight, forit was of quite elfin-like beauty. The child had dropped her coveron the floor, and the moonlight looked in at the naked little limbs.Presently she opened her eyes and looked at the moonlight that wasbathing her."Em!" she called to the sleeper in the other bed; but received noanswer. Then she drew the cover from the floor, turned her pillow, andpulling the sheet over her head, went to sleep again.Only in one of the outbuildings that jutted from the wagon-house therewas some one who was not asleep.The room was dark; door and shutter were closed; not a ray of lightentered anywhere. The German overseer, to whom the room belonged, laysleeping soundly on his bed in the corner, his great arms folded, andhis bushy grey and black beard rising and falling on his breast. But onein the room was not asleep. Two large eyes looked about in the darkness,and two small hands were smoothing the patchwork quilt. The boy, whoslept on a box under the window, had just awakened from his first sleep.He drew the quilt up to his chin, so that little peered above it but agreat head of silky black curls and the two black eyes. He staredabout in the darkness. Nothing was visible, not even the outline of oneworm-eaten rafter, nor of the deal table, on which lay the Bible fromwhich his father had read before they went to bed. No one could tellwhere the toolbox was, and where the fireplace. There was something veryimpressive to the child in the complete darkness.At the head of his father's bed hung a great silver hunting watch. Itticked loudly. The boy listened to it, and began mechanically to count.Tick--tick--one, two, three, four! He lost count presently, and onlylistened. Tick--tick--tick--tick!It never waited; it went on inexorably; and every time it ticked a mandied! He raised himself a little on his elbow and listened. He wished itwould leave off.How many times had it ticked since he came to lie down? A thousandtimes, a million times, perhaps.He tried to count again, and sat up to listen better."Dying, dying, dying!" said the watch; "dying, dying, dying!"He heard it distinctly. Where were they going to, all those people?He lay down quickly, and pulled the cover up over his head: butpresently the silky curls reappeared."Dying, dying, dying!" said the watch; "dying, dying, dying!"He thought of the words his father had read that evening--"For wide isthe gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction and manythere be which go in thereat.""Many, many, many!" said the watch."Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth untolife, and few there be that find it.""Few, few, few!" said the watch.The boy lay with his eyes wide open. He saw before him a long stream ofpeople, a great dark multitude, that moved in one direction; then theycame to the dark edge of the world and went over. He saw them passingon before him, and there was nothing that could stop them. He thought ofhow that stream had rolled on through all the long ages of the past--howthe old Greeks and Romans had gone over; the countless millions of Chinaand India, they were going over now. Since he had come to bed, how manyhad gone!And the watch said, "Eternity, eternity, eternity!""Stop them! stop them!" cried the child.And all the while the watch kept ticking on; just like God's will, thatnever changes or alters, you may do what you please.Great beads of perspiration stood on the boy's forehead. He climbed outof bed and lay with his face turned to the mud floor."Oh, God, God! save them!" he cried in agony. "Only some, only a few!Only for each moment I am praying here one!" He folded his little handsupon his head. "God! God! save them!"He grovelled on the floor.Oh, the long, long ages of the past, in which they had gone over! Oh,the long, long future, in which they would pass away! Oh, God! the long,long, long eternity, which has no end!The child wept, and crept closer to the ground.*****The Sacrifice.The farm by daylight was not as the farm by moonlight. The plain was aweary flat of loose red sand, sparsely covered by dry karoo bushes,that cracked beneath the tread like tinder, and showed the red eartheverywhere. Here and there a milk-bush lifted its pale-coloured rods,and in every direction the ants and beetles ran about in theblazing sand. The red walls of the farmhouse, the zinc roofs of theoutbuildings, the stone walls of the kraals, all reflected the fiercesunlight, till the eye ached and blenched. No tree or shrub was tobe seen far or near. The two sunflowers that stood before the door,out-stared by the sun, drooped their brazen faces to the sand; and thelittle cicada-like insects cried aloud among the stones of the kopje.The Boer-woman, seen by daylight, was even less lovely than when, inbed, she rolled and dreamed. She sat on a chair in the great front room,with her feet on a wooden stove, and wiped her flat face with the cornerof her apron, and drank coffee, and in Cape Dutch swore that thebeloved weather was damned. Less lovely, too, by daylight was the deadEnglishman's child, her little stepdaughter, upon whose freckles andlow, wrinkled forehead the sunlight had no mercy."Lyndall," the child said to her little orphan cousin, who sat with heron the floor threading beads, "how is it your beads never fall off yourneedle?""I try," said the little one gravely, moistening her tiny finger. "Thatis why."The overseer, seen by daylight, was a huge German, wearing a shabbysuit, and with a childish habit of rubbing his hands and nodding hishead prodigiously when pleased at anything. He stood out at the kraalsin the blazing sun, explaining to two Kaffer boys the approaching endof the world. The boys, as they cut the cakes of dung, winked at eachother, and worked as slowly as they possibly could; but the German neversaw it.Away, beyond the kopje, Waldo his son herded the ewes and lambs--asmall and dusty herd--powdered all over from head to foot with red sand,wearing a ragged coat and shoes of undressed leather, through whoseholes the toes looked out. His hat was too large, and had sunk down tohis eyes, concealing completely the silky black curls. It was a curioussmall figure. His flock gave him little trouble. It was too hot for themto move far; they gathered round every little milk-bush, as though theyhoped to find shade, and stood there motionless in clumps. He himselfcrept under a shelving rock that lay at the foot of the kopje, stretchedhimself on his stomach, and waved his dilapidated little shoes in theair.Soon, from the blue bag where he kept his dinner, he produced a fragmentof slate, an arithmetic, and a pencil. Proceeding to put down a sum withsolemn and earnest demeanour, he began to add it up aloud: "Six andtwo is eight--and four is twelve--and two is fourteen--and fouris eighteen." Here he paused. "And four is eighteen--and--four--is,eighteen." The last was very much drawled. Slowly the pencil slippedfrom his fingers, and the slate followed it into the sand. For a whilehe lay motionless, then began muttering to himself, folded his littlearms, laid his head down upon them, and might have been asleep, but forthe muttering sound that from time to time proceeded from him. A curiousold ewe came to sniff at him; but it was long before he raised his head.When he did, he looked at the far-off hills with his heavy eyes."Ye shall receive--ye shall receive--shall, shall, shall," he muttered.He sat up then. Slowly the dulness and heaviness melted from his face;it became radiant. Midday had come now, and the sun's rays were poureddown vertically; the earth throbbed before the eye.The boy stood up quickly, and cleared a small space from the busheswhich covered it. Looking carefully, he found twelve small stones ofsomewhat the same size; kneeling down, he arranged them carefully on thecleared space in a square pile, in shape like an altar. Then he walkedto the bag where his dinner was kept; in it was a mutton chop and alarge slice of brown bread. The boy took them out and turned the breadover in his hand, deeply considering it. Finally he threw it away andwalked to the altar with the meat, and laid it down on the stones. Closeby in the red sand he knelt down. Sure, never since the beginning of theworld was there so ragged and so small a priest. He took off his greathat and placed it solemnly on the ground, then closed his eyes andfolded his hands. He prayed aloud:"Oh, God, my Father, I have made Thee a sacrifice. I have only twopence,so I cannot buy a lamb. If the lambs were mine, I would give Thee one;but now I have only this meat; it is my dinner meat. Please, my Father,send fire down from heaven to burn it. Thou hast said, Whosoever shallsay unto this mountain, Be thou cast into the sea, nothing doubting, itshall be done. I ask for the sake of Jesus Christ. Amen."He knelt down with his face upon the ground, and he folded his handsupon his curls. The fierce sun poured down its heat upon his head andupon his altar. When he looked up he knew what he should see--the gloryof God! For fear his very heart stood still, his breath came heavily;he was half suffocated. He dared not look up. Then at last he raisedhimself. Above him was the quiet blue sky, about him the red earth;there were the clumps of silent ewes and his altar--that was all.He looked up--nothing broke the intense stillness of the blue overhead.He looked round in astonishment, then he bowed again, and this timelonger than before.When he raised himself the second time all was unaltered. Only the sunhad melted the fat of the little mutton chop, and it ran down upon thestones.Then, the third time he bowed himself. When at last he looked up, someants had come to the meat on the altar. He stood up and drove them away.Then he put his hat on his hot curls, and sat in the shade. He claspedhis hands about his knees. He sat to watch what would come to pass. Theglory of the Lord God Almighty! He knew he should see it."My dear God is trying me," he said; and he sat there through the fierceheat of the afternoon. Still he watched and waited when the sun began toslope, and when it neared the horizon and the sheep began to cast longshadows across the karoo, he still sat there. He hoped when the firstrays touched the hills till the sun dipped behind them and was gone.Then he called his ewes together, and broke down the altar, and threwthe meat far, far away into the field.He walked home behind his flock. His heart was heavy. He reasoned so:"God cannot lie. I had faith. No fire came. I am like Cain--I am notHis. He will not hear my prayer. God hates me."The boy's heart was heavy. When he reached the kraal gate the two girlsmet him."Come," said the yellow-haired Em, "let us play coop. There is stilltime before it gets quite dark. You, Waldo, go and hide on the kopje;Lyndall and I will shut eyes here, and we will not look."The girls hid their faces in the stone wall of the sheep-kraal, and theboy clambered half way up the kopje. He crouched down between two stonesand gave the call. Just then the milk-herd came walking out of thecow-kraal with two pails. He was an ill-looking Kaffer."Ah!" thought the boy, "perhaps he will die tonight, and go to hell! Imust pray for him, I must pray!"Then he thought--"Where am I going to?" and he prayed desperately."Ah! this is not right at all," little Em said, peeping between thestones, and finding him in a very curious posture. "What are you doingWaldo? It is not the play, you know. You should run out when we come tothe white stone. Ah, you do not play nicely.""I--I will play nicely now," said the boy, coming out and standingsheepishly before them; "I--I only forgot; I will play now.""He has been to sleep," said freckled Em."No," said beautiful little Lyndall, looking curiously at him: "he hasbeen crying."She never made a mistake.*****The Confession.One night, two years after, the boy sat alone on the kopje. He had creptsoftly from his father's room and come there. He often did, because,when he prayed or cried aloud, his father might awake and hear him; andnone knew his great sorrow, and none knew his grief, but he himself, andhe buried them deep in his heart.He turned up the brim of his great hat and looked at the moon, butmost at the leaves of the prickly pear that grew just before him. Theyglinted, and glinted, and glinted, just like his own heart--cold, sohard, and very wicked. His physical heart had pain also; it seemed fullof little bits of glass, that hurt. He had sat there for half an hour,and he dared not go back to the close house.He felt horribly lonely. There was not one thing so wicked as he inall the world, and he knew it. He folded his arms and began to cry--notaloud; he sobbed without making any sound, and his tears left scorchedmarks where they fell. He could not pray; he had prayed night and dayfor so many months; and tonight he could not pray. When he left offcrying, he held his aching head with his brown hands. If one might havegone up to him and touched him kindly; poor, ugly little thing! Perhapshis heart was almost broken.With his swollen eyes he sat there on a flat stone at the very top ofthe kopje; and the tree, with every one of its wicked leaves, blinked,and blinked, and blinked at him. Presently he began to cry again, andthen stopped his crying to look at it. He was quiet for a long while,then he knelt up slowly and bent forward. There was a secret he hadcarried in his heart for a year. He had not dared to look at it; he hadnot whispered it to himself, but for a year he had carried it. "I hateGod!" he said. The wind took the words and ran away with them, among thestones, and through the leaves of the prickly pear. He thought it diedaway half down the kopje. He had told it now!"I love Jesus Christ, but I hate God."The wind carried away that sound as it had done the first. Then he gotup and buttoned his old coat about him. He knew he was certainly lostnow; he did not care. If half the world were to be lost, why not hetoo? He would not pray for mercy any more. Better so--better to knowcertainly. It was ended now. Better so.He began scrambling down the sides of the kopje to go home.Better so! But oh, the loneliness, the agonized pain! for that night,and for nights on nights to come! The anguish that sleeps all day on theheart like a heavy worm, and wakes up at night to feed!There are some of us who in after years say to Fate, "Now deal us yourhardest blow, give us what you will; but let us never again suffer as wesuffered when we were children."The barb in the arrow of childhood's suffering is this: its intenseloneliness, its intense agony.Chapter 1.II. Plans and Bushman Paintings.At last came the year of the great drought, the year ofeighteen-sixty-two. From end to end of the land the earth cried forwater. Man and beast turned their eyes to the pitiless sky, that likethe roof of some brazen oven arched overhead. On the farm, day afterday, month after month, the water in the dams fell lower and lower; thesheep died in the fields; the cattle, scarcely able to crawl, totteredas they moved from spot to spot in search of food. Week after week,month after month, the sun looked down from the cloudless sky, till thekaroo-bushes were leafless sticks, broken into the earth, and the earthitself was naked and bare; and only the milk-bushes, like old hags,pointed their shrivelled fingers heavenward, praying for the rain thatnever came.*****It was on an afternoon of a long day in that thirsty summer, that on theside of the kopje furthest from the homestead the two girls sat. Theywere somewhat grown since the days when they played hide-and-seek there,but they were mere children still.Their dress was of dark, coarse stuff; their common blue pinaforesreached to their ankles, and on their feet they wore home-madevelschoen.They sat under a shelving rock, on the surface of which were stillvisible some old Bushman paintings, their red and black pigments havingbeen preserved through long years from wind and rain by the overhangingledge; grotesque oxen, elephants, rhinoceroses, and a one-horned beast,such as no man ever has seen or ever shall.The girls sat with their backs to the paintings. In their laps were afew fern and ice-plant leaves, which by dint of much searching they hadgathered under the rocks.Em took off her big brown kapje and began vigorously to fan her red facewith it; but her companion bent low over the leaves in her lap, and atlast took up an ice-plant leaf and fastened it on to the front of herblue pinafore with a pin."Diamonds must look as these drops do," she said, carefully bending overthe leaf, and crushing one crystal drop with her delicate little nail."When I," she said, "am grown up, I shall wear real diamonds, exactlylike these in my hair."Her companion opened her eyes and wrinkled her low forehead."Where will you find them, Lyndall? The stones are only crystals that wepicked up yesterday. Old Otto says so.""And you think that I am going to stay here always?"The lip trembled scornfully."Ah, no," said her companion. "I suppose some day we shall go somewhere;but now we are only twelve, and we cannot marry till we are seventeen.Four years, five--that is a long time to wait. And we might not havediamonds if we did marry.""And you think that I am going to stay here till then?""Well, where are you going?" asked her companion.The girl crushed an ice-plant leaf between her fingers."Tant Sannie is a miserable old woman," she said. "Your father marriedher when he was dying, because he thought she would take better care ofthe farm, and of us, than an English woman. He said we should be taughtand sent to school. Now she saves every farthing for herself, buys usnot even one old book. She does not ill-use us--why? Because she isafraid of your father's ghost. Only this morning she told her Hottentotthat she would have beaten you for breaking the plate, but that threenights ago she heard a rustling and a grunting behind the pantry door,and knew it was your father coming to spook her. She is a miserable oldwoman," said the girl, throwing the leaf from her; "but I intend to goto school.""And if she won't let you?""I shall make her.""How?"The child took not the slightest notice of the last question, and foldedher small arms across her knees."But why do you want to go, Lyndall?""There is nothing helps in this world," said the child slowly, "but tobe very wise, and to know everything--to be clever.""But I should not like to go to school!" persisted the small freckledface."And you do not need to. When you are seventeen this Boer-woman will go;you will have this farm and everything that is upon it for your own; butI," said Lyndall, "will have nothing. I must learn.""Oh, Lyndall! I will give you some of my sheep," said Em, with a suddenburst of pitying generosity."I do not want your sheep," said the girl slowly; "I want things of myown. When I am grown up," she added, the flush on her delicate featuresdeepening at every word, "there will be nothing that I do not know. Ishall be rich, very rich; and I shall wear not only for best, but everyday, a pure white silk, and little rose-buds, like the lady in TantSannie's bedroom, and my petticoats will be embroidered, not only at thebottom, but all through."The lady in Tant Sannie's bedroom was a gorgeous creature from afashion-sheet, which the Boer-woman, somewhere obtaining, had pasted upat the foot of her bed, to be profoundly admired by the children."It would be very nice," said Em; but it seemed a dream of quite tootranscendent a glory ever to be realized.At this instant there appeared at the foot of the kopje two figures--theone, a dog, white and sleek, one yellow ear hanging down over his lefteye; the other, his master, a lad of fourteen, and no other than the boyWaldo, grown into a heavy, slouching youth of fourteen. The dog mountedthe kopje quickly, his master followed slowly. He wore an aged jacketmuch too large for him, and rolled up at the wrists, and, as of old, apair of dilapidated velschoens and a felt hat. He stood before the twogirls at last."What have you been doing today?" asked Lyndall, lifting her eyes to hisface."Looking after ewes and lambs below the dam. Here!" he said, holding outhis hand awkwardly, "I brought them for you."There were a few green blades of tender grass."Where did you find them?""On the dam wall."She fastened them beside the leaf on her blue pinafore."They look nice there," said the boy, awkwardly rubbing his great handsand watching her."Yes; but the pinafore spoils it all; it is not pretty."He looked at it closely."Yes, the squares are ugly; but it looks nice upon you--beautiful."He now stood silent before them, his great hands hanging loosely ateither side."Some one has come today," he mumbled out suddenly, when the idea struckhim."Who?" asked both girls."An Englishman on foot.""What does he look like?" asked Em."I did not notice; but he has a very large nose," said the boy slowly."He asked the way to the house.""Didn't he tell you his name?""Yes--Bonaparte Blenkins.""Bonaparte!" said Em, "why that is like the reel Hottentot Hans plays onthe violin--     'Bonaparte, Bonaparte, my wife is sick;      In the middle of the week, but Sundays not,      I give her rice and beans for soup'--It is a funny name.""There was a living man called Bonaparte once," said she of the greateyes."Ah yes, I know," said Em--"the poor prophet whom the lions ate. I amalways so sorry for him."Her companion cast a quiet glance upon her."He was the greatest man who ever lived," she said, "the man I likebest.""And what did he do?" asked Em, conscious that she had made a mistake,and that her prophet was not the man."He was one man, only one," said her little companion slowly, "yet allthe people in the world feared him. He was not born great, he was commonas we are; yet he was master of the world at last. Once he was only alittle child, then he was a lieutenant, then he was a general, then hewas an emperor. When he said a thing to himself he never forgot it. Hewaited, and waited and waited, and it came at last.""He must have been very happy," said Em."I do not know," said Lyndall; "but he had what he said he would have,and that is better than being happy. He was their master, and all thepeople were white with fear of him. They joined together to fight him.He was one and they were many, and they got him down at last. Theywere like the wild cats when their teeth are fast in a great dog, likecowardly wild cats," said the child, "they would not let him go. Therewere many; he was only one. They sent him to an island on the sea, alonely island, and kept him there fast. He was one man, and they weremany, and they were terrified at him. It was glorious!" said the child."And what then?" said Em."Then he was alone there in that island with men to watch him always,"said her companion, slowly and quietly. "And in the long lonely nightshe used to lie awake and think of the things he had done in the olddays, and the things he would do if they let him go again. In the daywhen he walked near the shore it seemed to him that the sea all aroundhim was a cold chain about his body pressing him to death.""And then?" said Em, much interested."He died there in that island; he never got away.""It is rather a nice story," said Em; "but the end is sad.""It is a terrible, hateful ending," said the little teller of the story,leaning forward on her folded arms; "and the worst is, it is true. Ihave noticed," added the child very deliberately, "that it is only themade-up stories that end nicely; the true ones all end so."As she spoke the boy's dark, heavy eyes rested on her face."You have read it, have you not?"He nodded. "Yes; but the Brown history tells only what he did, not whathe thought.""It was in the Brown history that I read of him," said the girl; "but Iknow what he thought. Books do not tell everything.""No," said the boy, slowly drawing nearer to her and sitting down at herfeet. "What you want to know they never tell."Then the children fell into silence, till Doss, the dog, growing uneasyat its long continuance, sniffed at one and the other, and his masterbroke forth suddenly:"If they could talk, if they could tell us now!" he said, moving hishand out over the surrounding objects--"then we would know something.This kopje, if it could tell us how it came here! The 'PhysicalGeography' says," he went on most rapidly and confusedly, "that whatwere dry lands now were once lakes; and what I think is this--these lowhills were once the shores of a lake; this kopje is some of the stonesthat were at the bottom, rolled together by the water. But there isthis--How did the water come to make one heap here alone, in the centreof the plain?" It was a ponderous question; no one volunteered ananswer. "When I was little," said the boy, "I always looked at it andwondered, and I thought a great giant was buried under it. Now I knowthe water must have done it; but how? It is very wonderful. Did onelittle stone come first, and stop the others as they rolled?" said theboy with earnestness, in a low voice, more as speaking to himself thanto them."Oh, Waldo, God put the little kopje here," said Em with solemnity."But how did he put it here?""By wanting.""But how did the wanting bring it here?""Because it did."The last words were uttered with the air of one who produces a clinchingargument. What effect it had on the questioner was not evident, for hemade no reply, and turned away from her.Drawing closer to Lyndall's feet, he said after a while in a low voice:"Lyndall, has it never seemed to you that the stones were talking withyou? Sometimes," he added in a yet lower tone, "I lie under there withmy sheep, and it seems that the stones are really speaking--speaking ofthe old things, of the time when the strange fishes and animals livedthat are turned into stone now, and the lakes were here; and then of thetime when the little Bushmen lived here, so small and so ugly, and usedto sleep in the wild dog holes, and in the sloots, and eat snakes, andshot the bucks with their poisoned arrows. It was one of them, oneof these old wild Bushmen, that painted those," said the boy, noddingtoward the pictures--"one who was different from the rest. He did notknow why, but he wanted to make something beautiful--he wanted to makesomething, so he made these. He worked hard, very hard, to find thejuice to make the paint; and then he found this place where the rockshang over, and he painted them. To us they are only strange things, thatmake us laugh; but to him they were very beautiful."The children had turned round and looked at the pictures."He used to kneel here naked, painting, painting, painting; and hewondered at the things he made himself," said the boy, rising and movinghis hand in deep excitement. "Now the Boers have shot them all, so thatwe never see a little yellow face peeping out among the stones." Hepaused, a dreamy look coming over his face. "And the wild bucks havegone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, andonly the stones will lie on here, looking at everything like they looknow. I know that it is I who am thinking," the fellow added slowly, "butit seems as though it were they who are talking. Has it never seemed soto you, Lyndall?""No, it never seems so to me," she answered.The sun had dipped now below the hills, and the boy, suddenlyremembering the ewes and lambs, started to his feet."Let us also go to the house and see who has come," said Em, as the boyshuffled away to rejoin his flock, while Doss ran at his heels, snappingat the ends of the torn trousers as they fluttered in the wind.Chapter 1.III. I Was A Stranger, and Ye Took Me In.As the two girls rounded the side of the kopje, an unusual scenepresented itself. A large group was gathered at the back door of thehomestead.On the doorstep stood the Boer-woman, a hand on each hip, her facered and fiery, her head nodding fiercely. At her feet sat the yellowHottentot maid, her satellite, and around stood the black Kaffer maids,with blankets twisted round their half-naked figures. Two, who stampedmealies in a wooden block, held the great stampers in their hands, andstared stupidly at the object of attraction. It certainly was not tolook at the old German overseer, who stood in the centre of the group,that they had all gathered together. His salt-and-pepper suit, grizzlyblack beard, and grey eyes were as familiar to every one on the farmas the red gables of the homestead itself; but beside him stood thestranger, and on him all eyes were fixed. Ever and anon the newcomercast a glance over his pendulous red nose to the spot where theBoer-woman stood, and smiled faintly."I'm not a child," cried the Boer-woman, in low Cape Dutch, "and Iwasn't born yesterday. No, by the Lord, no! You can't take me in! Mymother didn't wean me on Monday. One wink of my eye and I see the wholething. I'll have no tramps sleeping on my farm," cried Tant Sannieblowing. "No, by the devil, no! not though he had sixty-times-six rednoses."There the German overseer mildly interposed that the man was not atramp, but a highly respectable individual, whose horse had died by anaccident three days before."Don't tell me," cried the Boer-woman; "the man isn't born that can takeme in. If he'd had money, wouldn't he have bought a horse? Men who walkare thieves, liars, murderers, Rome's priests, seducers! I see the devilin his nose!" cried Tant Sannie shaking her fist at him; "and to comewalking into the house of this Boer's child and shaking hands as thoughhe came on horseback! Oh, no, no!"The stranger took off his hat, a tall, battered chimneypot, anddisclosed a bald head, at the back of which was a little fringe ofcurled white hair, and he bowed to Tant Sannie."What does she remark, my friend?" he inquired, turning hiscrosswise-looking eyes on the old German.The German rubbed his old hands and hesitated."Ah--well--ah--the--Dutch--you know--do not like people who walk--inthis country--ah!""My dear friend," said the stranger, laying his hand on the German'sarm, "I should have bought myself another horse, but crossing, five daysago, a full river, I lost my purse--a purse with five hundred poundsin it. I spent five days on the bank of the river trying to findit--couldn't. Paid a Kaffer nine pounds to go in and look for it at therisk of his life--couldn't find it."The German would have translated this information, but the Boer-womangave no ear."No, no; he goes tonight. See how he looks at me--a poor unprotectedfemale! If he wrongs me, who is to do me right?" cried Tant Sannie."I think," said the German in an undertone, "if you didn't look at herquite so much it might be advisable. She--ah--she--might--imagine thatyou liked her too well,--in fact--ah--""Certainly, my dear friend, certainly," said the stranger. "I shall notlook at her."Saying this, he turned his nose full upon a small Kaffer of two yearsold. That small naked son of Ham became instantly so terrified that hefled to his mother's blanket for protection, howling horribly.Upon this the newcomer fixed his eyes pensively on the stamp-block,folding his hands on the head of his cane. His boots were broken, but hestill had the cane of a gentleman."You vagabonds se Engelschman!" said Tant Sannie, looking straight athim.This was a near approach to plain English; but the man contemplated theblock abstractedly, wholly unconscious that any antagonism was beingdisplayed toward him."You might not be a Scotchman or anything of that kind, might you?"suggested the German. "It is the English that she hates.""My dear friend," said the stranger, "I am Irish every inch ofme--father Irish, mother Irish. I've not a drop of English blood in myveins.""And you might not be married, might you?" persisted the German. "If youhad a wife and children, now? Dutch people do not like those who are notmarried.""Ah," said the stranger, looking tenderly at the block, "I have a dearwife and three sweet little children--two lovely girls and a noble boy."This information having been conveyed to the Boer-woman, she, after somefurther conversation, appeared slightly mollified; but remained firm toher conviction that the man's designs were evil."For, dear Lord!" she cried; "all Englishmen are ugly; but was thereever such a red-rag-nosed thing with broken boots and crooked eyesbefore? Take him to your room," she cried to the German; "but all thesin he does I lay at your door."The German having told him how matters were arranged, the stranger madea profound bow to Tant Sannie and followed his host, who led the way tohis own little room."I thought she would come to her better self soon," the German saidjoyously. "Tant Sannie is not wholly bad, far from it, far." Then seeinghis companion cast a furtive glance at him, which he mistook for one ofsurprise, he added quickly, "Ah, yes, yes; we are all a primitive peoplehere--not very lofty. We deal not in titles. Every one is Tante andOom--aunt and uncle. This may be my room," he said, opening the door."It is rough, the room is rough; not a palace--not quite. But it may bebetter than the fields, a little better!" he said, glancing round at hiscompanion. "Come in, come in. There is something to eat--a mouthful: notthe fare of emperors or kings; but we do not starve, not yet," hesaid, rubbing his hands together and looking round with a pleased,half-nervous smile on his old face."My friend, my dear friend," said the stranger, seizing him by the hand,"may the Lord bless you, the Lord bless and reward you--the God of thefatherless and the stranger. But for you I would this night have sleptin the fields, with the dews of heaven upon my head."Late that evening Lyndall came down to the cabin with the German'srations. Through the tiny square window the light streamed forth, andwithout knocking she raised the latch and entered. There was a fireburning on the hearth, and it cast its ruddy glow over the little dingyroom, with its worm-eaten rafters and mud floor, and broken whitewashedwalls. A curious little place, filled with all manner of articles. Nextto the fire was a great toolbox; beyond that the little bookshelf withits well-worn books; beyond that, in the corner, a heap of filled andempty grain-bags. From the rafters hung down straps, riems, old boots,bits of harness, and a string of onions. The bed was in another corner,covered by a patchwork quilt of faded red lions, and divided from therest of the room by a blue curtain, now drawn back. On the mantelshelfwas an endless assortment of little bags and stones; and on the wallhung a map of South Germany, with a red line drawn through it to showwhere the German had wandered. This place was the one home the girls hadknown for many a year. The house where Tant Sannie lived and ruled wasa place to sleep in, to eat in, not to be happy in. It was in vain shetold them they were grown too old to go there; every morning and eveningfound them there. Were there not too many golden memories hanging aboutthe old place for them to leave it?Long winter nights, when they had sat round the fire and roastedpotatoes, and asked riddles, and the old man had told of the littleGerman village, where, fifty years before, a little German boy hadplayed at snowballs, and had carried home the knitted stockings of alittle girl who afterward became Waldo's mother; did they not seem tosee the German peasant girls walking about with their wooden shoes andyellow, braided hair, and the little children eating their suppers outof little wooden bowls when the good mothers called them in to havetheir milk and potatoes?And were there not yet better times than these? Moonlight nights, whenthey romped about the door, with the old man, yet more a child than anyof them, and laughed, till the old roof of the wagon-house rang?Or, best of all, were there not warm, dark, starlight nights, when theysat together on the doorstep, holding each other's hands, singing Germanhymns, their voices rising clear in the still night air--till the Germanwould draw away his hand suddenly to wipe quickly a tear the childrenmust not see? Would they not sit looking up at the stars and talking ofthem--of the dear Southern Cross, red, fiery Mars, Orion, with his belt,and the Seven Mysterious Sisters--and fall to speculating over them?How old are they? Who dwelt in them? And the old German would saythat perhaps the souls we loved lived in them; there, in that littletwinkling point was perhaps the little girl whose stockings he hadcarried home; and the children would look up at it lovingly, and call it"Uncle Otto's star." Then they would fall to deeper speculations--ofthe times and seasons wherein the heavens shall be rolled together asa scroll, and the stars shall fall as a fig-tree casteth her untimelyfigs, and there shall be time no longer: "When the Son of man shallcome in His glory, and all His holy angels with Him." In lower and lowertones they would talk, till at last they fell into whispers; then theywould wish good night softly, and walk home hushed and quiet.Tonight, when Lyndall looked in, Waldo sat before the fire watching apot which simmered there, with his slate and pencil in his hand; hisfather sat at the table buried in the columns of a three-weeks-oldnewspaper; and the stranger lay stretched on the bed in the corner,fast asleep, his mouth open, his great limbs stretched out loosely,betokening much weariness. The girl put the rations down upon the table,snuffed the candle, and stood looking at the figure on the bed."Uncle Otto," she said presently, laying her hand down on the newspaper,and causing the old German to look up over his glasses, "how long didthat man say he had been walking?""Since this morning, poor fellow! A gentleman--not accustomed towalking--horse died--poor fellow!" said the German, pushing out his lipand glancing commiseratingly over his spectacles in the direction ofthe bed where the stranger lay, with his flabby double chin, and brokenboots through which the flesh shone."And do you believe him, Uncle Otto?""Believe him? why of course I do. He himself told me the story threetimes distinctly.""If," said the girl slowly, "he had walked for only one day his bootswould not have looked so; and if--""If!" said the German starting up in his chair, irritated that any oneshould doubt such irrefragable evidence--"if! Why, he told me himself!Look how he lies there," added the German pathetically, "worn out--poorfellow! We have something for him though," pointing with his forefingerover his shoulder to the saucepan that stood on the fire. "We are notcooks--not French cooks, not quite; but it's drinkable, drinkable, Ithink; better than nothing, I think," he added, nodding his head in ajocund manner that evinced his high estimation of the contents ofthe saucepan and his profound satisfaction therein. "Bish! bish! mychicken," he said, as Lyndall tapped her little foot up and down uponthe floor. "Bish! bish! my chicken, you will wake him."He moved the candle so that his own head might intervene between itand the sleeper's face; and, smoothing his newspaper, he adjusted hisspectacles to read.The child's grey-black eyes rested on the figure on the bed, then turnedto the German, then rested on the figure again."I think he is a liar. Good night, Uncle Otto," she said slowly, turningto the door.Long after she had gone the German folded his paper up methodically, andput it in his pocket.The stranger had not awakened to partake of the soup, and his son hadfallen asleep on the ground. Taking two white sheepskins from the heapof sacks in the corner, the old man doubled them up, and lifting theboy's head gently from the slate on which it rested, placed the skinsbeneath it."Poor lambie, poor lambie!" he said, tenderly patting the great roughbear-like head; "tired is he!"He threw an overcoat across the boy's feet, and lifted the saucepan fromthe fire. There was no place where the old man could comfortably liedown himself, so he resumed his seat. Opening a much-worn Bible, hebegan to read, and as he read pleasant thoughts and visions thronged onhim."I was a stranger, and ye took me in," he read.He turned again to the bed where the sleeper lay."I was a stranger."Very tenderly the old man looked at him. He saw not the bloated bodynor the evil face of the man; but, as it were, under deep disguise andfleshly concealment, the form that long years of dreaming had made veryreal to him. "Jesus, lover, and is it given to us, weak and sinful,frail and erring, to serve Thee, to take Thee in!" he said softly, as herose from his seat. Full of joy, he began to pace the little room. Nowand again as he walked he sang the lines of a German hymn, or mutteredbroken words of prayer. The little room was full of light. It appearedto the German that Christ was very near him, and that at almost anymoment the thin mist of earthly darkness that clouded his human eyesmight be withdrawn, and that made manifest of which the friends atEmmaus, beholding it, said, "It is the Lord!"Again, and yet again, through the long hours of that night, as theold man walked he looked up to the roof of his little room, with itsblackened rafters, and yet saw them not. His rough bearded face wasilluminated with a radiant gladness; and the night was not shorter tothe dreaming sleepers than to him whose waking dreams brought heavennear.So quickly the night fled, that he looked up with surprise when at fouro'clock the first grey streaks of summer dawn showed themselves throughthe little window. Then the old man turned to rake together the fewcoals that lay under the ashes, and his son, turning on the sheepskins,muttered sleepily to know if it were time to rise."Lie still, lie still! I would only make a fire," said the old man."Have you been up all night?" asked the boy."Yes; but it has been short, very short. Sleep again, my chicken; it isyet early."And he went out to fetch more fuel.Chapter 1.IV. Blessed is He That Believeth.Bonaparte Blenkins sat on the side of the bed. He had wonderfullyrevived since the day before, held his head high, talked in a fullsonorous voice, and ate greedily of all the viands offered him. At hisside was a basin of soup, from which he took a deep draught now andagain as he watched the fingers of the German, who sat on the mud floormending the bottom of a chair.Presently he looked out, where, in the afternoon sunshine, a fewhalf-grown ostriches might be seen wandering listlessly about, and thenhe looked in again at the little whitewashed room, and at Lyndall, whosat in the doorway looking at a book. Then he raised his chin and triedto adjust an imaginary shirt-collar. Finding none, he smoothed thelittle grey fringe at the back of his head, and began:"You are a student of history, I perceive, my friend, from the studyof these volumes that lie scattered about this apartment; this fact hasbeen made evident to me.""Well--a little--perhaps--it may be," said the German meekly."Being a student of history then," said Bonaparte, raising himselfloftily, "you will doubtless have heard of my great, of my celebratedkinsman, Napoleon Bonaparte?""Yes, yes," said the German, looking up."I, sir," said Bonaparte, "was born at this hour, on an April afternoon,three-and-fifty years ago. The nurse, sir--she was the same who attendedwhen the Duke of Sutherland was born--brought me to my mother. 'There isonly one name for this child,' she said: 'he has the nose of his greatkinsman;' and so Bonaparte Blenkins became my name--Bonaparte Blenkins.Yes, sir," said Bonaparte, "there is a stream on my maternal side thatconnects me with a stream on his maternal side."The German made a sound of astonishment."The connection," said Bonaparte, "is one which could not be easilycomprehended by one unaccustomed to the study of aristocratic pedigrees;but the connection is close.""Is it possible!" said the German, pausing in his work with muchinterest and astonishment. "Napoleon an Irishman!""Yes," said Bonaparte, "on the mother's side, and that is how we arerelated. There wasn't a man to beat him," said Bonaparte, stretchinghimself--"not a man except the Duke of Wellington. And it's a strangecoincidence," added Bonaparte, bending forward, "but he was a connectionof mine. His nephew, the Duke of Wellington's nephew, married a cousinof mine. She was a woman! See her at one of the court balls--ambersatin--daisies in her hair. Worth going a hundred miles to look at her!Often seen her there myself, sir!"The German moved the leather thongs in and out, and thought of thestrange vicissitudes of human life, which might bring the kinsman ofdukes and emperors to his humble room.Bonaparte appeared lost among old memories."Ah, that Duke of Wellington's nephew!" he broke forth suddenly; "many'sthe joke I've had with him. Often came to visit me at Bonaparte Hall.Grand place I had then--park, conservatory, servants. He had only onefault, that Duke of Wellington's nephew," said Bonaparte, observing thatthe German was deeply interested in every word, "He was a coward--whatyou might call a coward. You've never been in Russia, I suppose?" saidBonaparte, fixing his crosswise looking eyes on the German's face."No, no," said the old man humbly. "France, England, Germany, a littlein this country; it is all I have travelled.""I, my friend," said Bonaparte, "I have been in every country in theworld, and speak every civilised language, excepting only Dutch andGerman. I wrote a book of my travels--noteworthy incidents. Publishergot it--cheated me out of it. Great rascals those publishers! Uponone occasion the Duke of Wellington's nephew and I were travellingin Russia. All of a sudden one of the horses dropped down dead asa doornail. There we were--cold night--snow four feet thick--greatforest--one horse not being able to move the sledge--night comingon--wolves."'Spree!' says the Duke of Wellington's nephew."'Spree, do you call it? says I. 'Look out.'"There, sticking out under a bush, was nothing less than the nose of abear. The Duke of Wellington's nephew was up a tree like a shot; I stoodquietly on the ground, as cool as I am at this moment, loaded my gun,and climbed up the tree. There was only one bough."'Bon,' said the Duke of Wellington's nephew, 'you'd better sit infront.'"'All right,' said I; 'but keep your gun ready. There are more coming.'He'd got his face buried in my back."'How many are there?' said he."'Four,' said I."'How many are there now?' said he."'Eight,' said I."'How many are there now?' said he."'Ten,' said I."'Ten! ten!' said he; and down goes his gun."'Wallie,' I said, 'what have you done? We're dead men now.'"'Bon, my old fellow,' said he, 'I couldn't help it; my hands trembledso!'"'Wall,' I said, turning round and seizing his hand, 'Wallie, my dearlad, good-bye. I'm not afraid to die. My legs are long--they hangdown--the first bear that comes and I don't hit him, off goes my foot.When he takes it I shall give you my gun and go. You may yet be saved;but tell, oh, tell Mary Ann that I thought of her, that I prayed forher.'"'Good-bye, old fellow,' said he."'God bless you,' said I."By this time the bears were sitting in a circle all around the tree.Yes," said Bonaparte impressively, fixing his eyes on the German, "aregular, exact, circle. The marks of their tails were left in the snow,and I measured it afterward; a drawing-master couldn't have done itbetter. It was that saved me. If they'd rushed on me at once, poor oldBon would never have been here to tell this story. But they came on,sir, systematically, one by one. All the rest sat on their tails andwaited. The first fellow came up, and I shot him; the second fellow--Ishot him; the third--I shot him. At last the tenth came; he was thebiggest of all--the leader, you may say."'Wall,' I said, 'give me your hand. My fingers are stiff with the cold;there is only one bullet left. I shall miss him. While he is eating meyou get down and take your gun; and live, dear friend, live to rememberthe man who gave his life for you!' By that time the bear was at me. Ifelt his paw on my trousers."'Oh, Bonnie! Bonnie!' said the Duke of Wellington's nephew. But I justtook my gun and put the muzzle to the bear's ear--over he fell--dead!"Bonaparte Blenkins waited to observe what effect his story had made.Then he took out a dirty white handkerchief and stroked his forehead,and more especially his eyes."It always affects me to relate that adventure," he remarked, returningthe handkerchief to his pocket. "Ingratitude--base, vile ingratitude--isrecalled by it! That man, that man, who but for me would have perishedin the pathless wilds of Russia, that man in the hour of my adversityforsook me." The German looked up. "Yes," said Bonaparte, "I had money,I had lands; I said to my wife: 'There is Africa, a struggling country;they want capital; they want men of talent; they want men of ability toopen up that land. Let us go.'"I bought eight thousand pounds' worth of machinery--winnowing, plowing,reaping machines; I loaded a ship with them. Next steamer I cameout--wife, children, all. Got to the Cape. Where is the ship withthe things? Lost--gone to the bottom! And the box with the money?Lost--nothing saved!"My wife wrote to the Duke of Wellington's nephew; I didn't wish her to;she did it without my knowledge."What did the man whose life I saved do? Did he send me thirty thousandpounds? say, 'Bonaparte, my brother, here is a crumb?' No; he sent menothing."My wife said, 'Write.' I said, 'Mary Ann, NO. While these hands havepower to work, NO. While this frame has power to endure, NO. Never shallit be said that Bonaparte Blenkins asked of any man.'"The man's noble independence touched the German."Your case is hard; yes, that is hard," said the German, shaking hishead.Bonaparte took another draught of the soup, leaned back against thepillows, and sighed deeply."I think," he said after a while, rousing himself, "I shall now wanderin the benign air, and taste the gentle cool of evening. The stiffnesshovers over me yet; exercise is beneficial."So saying, he adjusted his hat carefully on the bald crown of his head,and moved to the door. After he had gone the German sighed again overhis work:"Ah, Lord! So it is! Ah!"He thought of the ingratitude of the world."Uncle Otto," said the child in the doorway, "did you ever hear of tenbears sitting on their tails in a circle?""Well, not of ten exactly: but bears do attack travellers every day. Itis nothing unheard of," said the German. "A man of such courage, too!Terrible experience that!""And how do we know that the story is true, Uncle Otto?"The German's ire was roused."That is what I do hate!" he cried. "Know that is true! How do you knowthat anything is true? Because you are told so. If we begin to questioneverything--proof, proof, proof, what will we have to believe left?How do you know the angel opened the prison door for Peter, except thatPeter said so? How do you know that God talked to Moses, except thatMoses wrote it? That is what I hate!"The girl knit her brows. Perhaps her thoughts made a longer journey thanthe German dreamed of; for, mark you, the old dream little how theirwords and lives are texts and studies to the generation that shallsucceed them. Not what we are taught, but what we see, makes us, and thechild gathers the food on which the adult feeds to the end.When the German looked up next there was a look of supreme satisfactionin the little mouth and the beautiful eyes."What dost see, chicken?" he asked.The child said nothing, and an agonizing shriek was borne on theafternoon breeze."Oh, God! my God! I am killed!" cried the voice of Bonaparte, as he,with wide open mouth and shaking flesh, fell into the room, followed bya half-grown ostrich, who put its head in at the door, opened its beakat him, and went away."Shut the door! shut the door! As you value my life, shut the door!"cried Bonaparte, sinking into a chair, his face blue and white, witha greenishness about the mouth. "Ah, my friend," he said tremulously,"eternity has looked me in the face! My life's thread hung upon a cord!The valley of the shadow of death!" said Bonaparte, seizing the German'sarm."Dear, dear, dear!" said the German, who had closed the lower half ofthe door, and stood much concerned beside the stranger, "you have had afright. I never knew so young a bird to chase before; but they will takedislikes to certain people. I sent a boy away once because a bird wouldchase him. Ah, dear, dear!""When I looked round," said Bonaparte, "the red and yawning cavity wasabove me, and the reprehensible paw raised to strike me. My nerves,"said Bonaparte, suddenly growing faint, "always delicate--highlystrung--are broken--broken! You could not give a little wine, a littlebrandy my friend?"The old German hurried away to the bookshelf, and took from behindthe books a small bottle, half of whose contents he poured into a cup.Bonaparte drained it eagerly."How do you feel now?" asked the German, looking at him with muchsympathy."A little, slightly, better."The German went out to pick up the battered chimneypot which had fallenbefore the door."I am sorry you got the fright. The birds are bad things till you knowthem," he said sympathetically, as he put the hat down."My friend," said Bonaparte, holding out his hand, "I forgive you; donot be disturbed. Whatever the consequences, I forgive you. I know, Ibelieve, it was with no ill-intent that you allowed me to go out. Giveme your hand. I have no ill-feeling; none!""You are very kind," said the German, taking the extended hand, andfeeling suddenly convinced that he was receiving magnanimous forgivenessfor some great injury, "you are very kind.""Don't mention it," said Bonaparte.He knocked out the crown of his caved-in old hat, placed it on the tablebefore him, leaned his elbows on the table and his face in his hands,and contemplated it."Ah, my old friend," he thus apostrophized the hat, "you have served melong, you have served me faithfully, but the last day has come. Nevermore shall you be borne upon the head of your master. Never more shallyou protect his brow from the burning rays of summer or the cuttingwinds of winter. Henceforth bare-headed must your master go. Good-bye,good-bye, old hat!"At the end of this affecting appeal the German rose. He went to thebox at the foot of his bed; out of it he took a black hat, which hadevidently been seldom worn and carefully preserved."It's not exactly what you may have been accustomed to," he saidnervously, putting it down beside the battered chimneypot, "but it mightbe of some use--a protection to the head, you know.""My friend," said Bonaparte, "you are not following my advice; you areallowing yourself to be reproached on my account. Do not make yourselfunhappy. No; I shall go bare-headed.""No, no, no!" cried the German energetically. "I have no use for thehat, none at all. It is shut up in the box.""Then I will take it, my friend. It is a comfort to one's own mind whenyou have unintentionally injured any one to make reparation. I know thefeeling. The hat may not be of that refined cut of which the old onewas, but it will serve, yes, it will serve. Thank you," said Bonaparte,adjusting it on his head, and then replacing it on the table. "I shalllie down now and take a little repose," he added; "I much fear myappetite for supper will be lost.""I hope not, I hope not," said the German, reseating himself at hiswork, and looking much concerned as Bonaparte stretched himself on thebed and turned the end of the patchwork quilt over his feet."You must not think to make your departure, not for many days," said theGerman presently. "Tant Sannie gives her consent, and--""My friend," said Bonaparte, closing his eyes sadly, "you are kind; butwere it not that tomorrow is the Sabbath, weak and trembling as I liehere, I would proceed on my way. I must seek work; idleness but for aday is painful. Work, labour--that is the secret of all true happiness!"He doubled the pillar under his head, and watched how the German drewthe leather thongs in and out.After a while Lyndall silently put her book on the shelf and wenthome, and the German stood up and began to mix some water and meal forroaster-cakes. As he stirred them with his hands he said:"I make always a double supply on Saturday night; the hands are thenfree as the thoughts for Sunday.""The blessed Sabbath!" said Bonaparte.There was a pause. Bonaparte twisted his eyes without moving his head,to see if supper were already on the fire."You must sorely miss the administration of the Lord's word in thisdesolate spot," added Bonaparte. "Oh, how love I Thine house, and theplace where Thine honour dwelleth!""Well, we do; yes," said the German; "but we do our best. We meettogether, and I--well, I say a few words, and perhaps they are notwholly lost, not quite.""Strange coincidence," said Bonaparte; "my plan always was the same.Was in the Free State once--solitary farm--one neighbour. Every SundayI called together friend and neighbour, child and servant, and said,'Rejoice with me, that we may serve the Lord,' and then I addressedthem. Ah, those were blessed times," said Bonaparte; "would they mightreturn."The German stirred at the cakes, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred.He could give the stranger his bed, and he could give the stranger hishat, and he could give the stranger his brandy; but his Sunday service!After a good while he said:"I might speak to Tant Sannie; I might arrange; you might take theservice in my place, if it--""My friend," said Bonaparte, "it would give me the profoundest felicity,the most unbounded satisfaction; but in these worn-out habiliments, inthese deteriorated garments, it would not be possible, it would not befitting that I should officiate in service of One whom, for respect, weshall not name. No, my friend, I will remain here; and, while you areassembling yourselves together in the presence of the Lord, I, in mysolitude, will think of and pray for you. No; I will remain here!"It was a touching picture--the solitary man there praying for them. TheGerman cleared his hands from the meal, and went to the chest from whichhe had taken the black hat. After a little careful feeling about, heproduced a black cloth coat, trousers, and waistcoat, which he laid onthe table, smiling knowingly. They were of new shining cloth, worn twicea year, when he went to the town to nachtmaal. He looked with greatpride at the coat as he unfolded it and held it up."It's not the latest fashion, perhaps, not a West End cut, not exactly;but it might do; it might serve at a push. Try it on, try it on!" hesaid, his old grey eyes twinkling with pride.Bonaparte stood up and tried on the coat. It fitted admirably; thewaistcoat could be made to button by ripping up the back, and thetrousers were perfect; but below were the ragged boots. The German wasnot disconcerted. Going to the beam where a pair of top-boots hung,he took them off, dusted them carefully, and put them down beforeBonaparte. The old eyes now fairly brimmed over with sparklingenjoyment."I have only worn them once. They might serve; they might be endured."Bonaparte drew them on and stood upright, his head almost touchingthe beams. The German looked at him with profound admiration. It waswonderful what a difference feathers made in the bird.Chapter 1.V. Sunday Services.Service No. I.The boy Waldo kissed the pages of his book and looked up. Far over theflat lay the kopje, a mere speck; the sheep wandered quietly from bushto bush; the stillness of the early Sunday rested everywhere, and theair was fresh.He looked down at his book. On its page a black insect crept. He liftedit off with his finger. Then he leaned on his elbow, watching itsquivering antennae and strange movements, smiling."Even you," he whispered, "shall not die. Even you He loves. Even you Hewill fold in His arms when He takes everything and makes it perfect andhappy."When the thing had gone he smoothed the leaves of his Bible somewhatcaressingly. The leaves of that book had dropped blood for him once;they had taken the brightness out of his childhood; from between themhad sprung the visions that had clung about him and made night horrible.Adder-like thoughts had lifted their heads, had shot out forked tonguesat him, asking mockingly strange, trivial questions that he could notanswer, miserable child:Why did the women in Mark see only one angel and the women in Luke two?Could a story be told in opposite ways and both ways be true? Could it?could it? Then again: Is there nothing always right, and nothing alwayswrong? Could Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite "put her hand to thenail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer?" and could the Spiritof the Lord chant paeans over her, loud paeans, high paeans, set in thebook of the Lord, and no voice cry out it was a mean and dastardly sinto lie, and kill the trusting in their sleep? Could the friend of Godmarry his own sister, and be beloved, and the man who does it today goesto hell, to hell? Was there nothing always right or always wrong?Those leaves had dropped blood for him once: they had made his heartheavy and cold; they had robbed his childhood of its gladness; now hisfingers moved over them caressingly."My father God knows, my father knows," he said; "we cannot understand;He knows." After a while he whispered, smiling--"I heard your voice thismorning when my eyes were not yet open, I felt you near me, my Father.Why do you love me so? His face was illuminated. In the last fourmonths the old question has gone from me. I know you are good; I knowyou love everything; I know, I know, I know! I could not have borne itany more, not any more." He laughed softly. "And all the while I was somiserable you were looking at me and loving me, and I never knew it.But I know it now. I feel it," said the boy, and he laughed low; "I feelit!" he laughed.After a while he began partly to sing, partly to chant the disconnectedverses of hymns, those which spoke his gladness, many times over. Thesheep with their senseless eyes turned to look at him as he sang.At last he lapsed into quiet. Then as the boy lay there staring at bushand sand, he saw a vision.He had crossed the river of Death, and walked on the other bank in theLord's land of Beulah. His feet sank into the dark grass, and he walkedalone. Then, far over the fields, he saw a figure coming across the darkgreen grass. At first he thought it must be one of the angels; but as itcame nearer he began to feel what it was. And it came closer, closer tohim, and then the voice said, "Come," and he knew surely Who it was. Heran to the dear feet and touched them with his hands; yes, he held themfast! He lay down beside them. When he looked up the face was over him,and the glorious eyes were loving him; and they two were there alonetogether.He laughed a deep laugh; then started up like one suddenly awakened fromsleep."Oh, God!" He cried, "I cannot wait; I cannot wait! I want to die; Iwant to see Him; I want to touch him. Let me die!" He folded his hands,trembling. "How can I wait so long--for long, long years perhaps? I wantto die--to see Him. I will die any death. Oh, let me come!"Weeping he bowed himself, and quivered from head to foot. After a longwhile he lifted his head."Yes; I will wait; I will wait. But not long; do not let it be verylong, Jesus King. I want you; oh, I want you--soon, soon!" He sat still,staring across the plain with his tearful eyes.Service No. II.In the front room of the farmhouse sat Tant Sannie in her elbow-chair.In her hand was her great brass-clasped hymn-book, round her neck was aclean white handkerchief, under her feet was a wooden stove. There toosat Em and Lyndall, in clean pinafores and new shoes. There too was thespruce Hottentot in a starched white kapje, and her husband on the otherside of the door, with his wool oiled and very much combed out, andstaring at his new leather boots. The Kaffer servants were not therebecause Tant Sannie held they were descended from apes, and needed nosalvation. But the rest were gathered for the Sunday service, and waitedthe officiator.Meanwhile Bonaparte and the German approached arm in arm--Bonaparteresplendent in the black cloth clothes, a spotless shirt, and a spotlesscollar; the German in the old salt-and-pepper, casting shy glances ofadmiration at his companion.At the front door Bonaparte removed his hat with much dignity, raisedhis shirt collar, and entered. To the centre table he walked, put hishat solemnly down by the big Bible, and bowed his head over it in silentprayer.The Boer-woman looked at the Hottentot, and the Hottentot looked at theBoer-woman.There was one thing on earth for which Tant Sannie had a profoundreverence, which exercised a subduing influence over her, which made herfor the time a better woman--that thing was new, shining black cloth. Itmade her think of the predikant; it made her think of the elders who satin the top pew of the church on Sundays, with the hair so nicely oiled,so holy and respectable, with their little swallow-tailed coats; it madeher think of heaven, where everything was so holy and respectable, andnobody wore tancord, and the littlest angel had a black-tailed coat. Shewished she hadn't called him a thief and a Roman Catholic. She hoped theGerman hadn't told him. She wondered where those clothes were when hecame in rags to her door. There was no doubt, he was a very respectableman, a gentleman.The German began to read a hymn. At the end of each line Bonapartegroaned, and twice at the end of every verse.The Boer-woman had often heard of persons groaning during prayers, toadd a certain poignancy and finish to them; old Jan Vanderlinde, hermother's brother, always did it after he was converted; and she wouldhave looked upon it as no especial sign of grace in any one; but togroan at hymn-time! She was startled. She wondered if he remembered thatshe shook her fist in his face. This was a man of God. They knelt downto pray. The Boer-woman weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, and couldnot kneel. She sat in her chair, and peeped between her crossed fingersat the stranger's back. She could not understand what he said; but hewas in earnest. He shook the chair by the back rail till it made quite alittle dust on the mud floor.When they rose from their knees Bonaparte solemnly seated himself inthe chair and opened the Bible. He blew his nose, pulled up his shirtcollar, smoothed the leaves, stroked down his capacious waistcoat, blewhis nose again, looked solemnly round the room, then began."All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire andbrimstone, which is the second death."Having read this portion of Scripture, Bonaparte paused impressively,and looked all round the room."I shall not, my dear friends," he said, "long detain you. Much ofour precious time has already fled blissfully from us in the voice ofthanksgiving and the tongue of praise. A few, a very few words are allI shall address to you, and may they be as a rod of iron dividing thebones from the marrow, and the marrow from the bones."In the first place: What is a liar?"The question was put so pointedly, and followed by a pause so profound,that even the Hottentot man left off looking at his boots and opened hiseyes, though he understood not a word."I repeat," said Bonaparte, "what is a liar?"The sensation was intense; the attention of the audience was riveted."Have you any of you ever seen a liar, my dear friends?" There was astill longer pause. "I hope not; I truly hope not. But I will tell youwhat a liar is. I knew a liar once--a little boy who lived in CapeTown, in Short Market Street. His mother and I sat together one day,discoursing about our souls."'Here, Sampson,' said his mother, 'go and buy sixpence of meiboss fromthe Malay round the corner.'"When he came back she said: 'How much have you got?'"'Five,' he said."He was afraid if he said six and a half she'd ask for some. And, myfriends, that was a lie. The half of a meiboss stuck in his throat andhe died and was buried. And where did the soul of that little liar goto, my friends? It went to the lake of fire and brimstone. This bringsme to the second point of my discourse."What is a lake of fire and brimstone? I will tell you, my friends,"said Bonaparte condescendingly. "The imagination unaided cannot conceiveit: but by the help of the Lord I will put it before your mind's eye."I was travelling in Italy once on a time; I came to a city called Rome,a vast city, and near it is a mountain which spits forth fire. Its nameis Etna. Now, there was a man in that city of Rome who had not the fearof God before his eyes, and he loved a woman. The woman died, and hewalked up that mountain spitting fire, and when he got to the top hethrew himself in at the hole that is there. The next day I went up.I was not afraid; the Lord preserves His servants. And in their handsshall they bear thee up, lest at any time thou fall into a volcano. Itwas dark night when I got there, but in the fear of the Lord I walked tothe edge of the yawning abyss, and looked in. That sight--that sight, myfriends, is impressed upon my most indelible memory. I looked down intothe lurid depths upon an incandescent lake, a melted fire, a seethingsea; the billows rolled from side to side, and on their fiery creststossed the white skeleton of the suicide. The heat had burnt the fleshfrom off the bones; they lay as a light cork upon the melted, fierywaves. One skeleton hand was raised upward, the finger pointing toheaven; the other, with outstretched finger, pointing downward, asthough it would say, 'I go below, but you, Bonaparte, may soar above.' Igazed; I stood entranced. At that instant there was a crack in the luridlake; it swelled, expanded, and the skeleton of the suicide disappeared,to be seen no more by mortal eye."Here again Bonaparte rested, and then continued:"The lake of melted stone rose in the crater, it swelled higher andhigher at the side, it streamed forth at the top. I had presence ofmind; near me was a rock; I stood upon it. The fiery torrent wasvomited out and streamed on either side of me. And through that long andterrible night I stood there alone upon that rock, the glowing,fiery lava on every hand--a monument of the long-suffering and tenderprovidence of the Lord, who spared me that I might this day testify inyour ears of Him."Now, my dear friends, let us deduce the lessons that are to be learntfrom this narrative."Firstly: let us never commit suicide. The man is a fool, my friends,that man is insane, my friends, who would leave this earth, my friends.Here are joys innumerable, such as it hath not entered into the heartof man to understand, my friends. Here are clothes, my friends; hereare beds, my friends; here is delicious food, my friends. Our preciousbodies were given us to love, to cherish. Oh, let us do so! Oh, let usnever hurt them; but care for and love them, my friends!"Every one was impressed, and Bonaparte proceeded:"Thirdly; let us not love too much. If that young man had not loved thatyoung woman, he would not have jumped into Mount Etna. The good men ofold never did so. Was Jeremiah ever in love, or Ezekiel, or Hosea, oreven any of the minor prophets? No. Then why should we be? Thousandsare rolling in that lake at this moment who would say, 'It was love thatbrought us here.' Oh, let us think always of our own souls first.     "'A charge to keep I have,         A God to glorify;       A never-dying soul to save,         And fit it for the sky.'"Oh, beloved friends, remember the little boy and the meiboss; rememberthe young girl and the young man; remember the lake, the fire, and thebrimstone; remember the suicide's skeleton on the pitchy billows ofMount Etna; remember the voice of warning that has this day sounded inyour ears; and what I say to you I say to all--watch! May the Lord addhis blessings!"Here the Bible closed with a tremendous thud. Tant Sannie loosened thewhite handkerchief about her neck and wiped her eyes, and the colouredgirl, seeing her do so, sniffled. The did not understand the discourse,which made it the more affecting.There hung over it that inscrutable charm which hovers forever for thehuman intellect over the incomprehensible and shadowy. When the lasthymn was sung the German conducted the officiator to Tant Sannie, whograciously extended her hand, and offered coffee and a seat on thesofa. Leaving him there, the German hurried away to see how the littleplum-pudding he had left at home was advancing; and Tant Sannie remarkedthat it was a hot day. Bonaparte gathered her meaning as she fannedherself with the end of her apron. He bowed low in acquiescence. A longsilence followed. Tant Sannie spoke again. Bonaparte gave her no ear;his eye was fixed on a small miniature on the opposite wall, whichrepresented Tant Sannie as she had appeared on the day before herconfirmation, fifteen years before, attired in green muslin. Suddenly hestarted to his feet, walked up to the picture, and took his stand beforeit. Long and wistfully he gazed into its features; it was easy to seethat he was deeply moved. With a sudden movement, as though no longerable to restrain himself, he seized the picture, loosened it fromits nail, and held it close to his eyes. At length, turning to theBoer-woman, he said, in a voice of deep emotion:"You will, I trust, dear madam, excuse this exhibition of my feelings;but this--this little picture recalls to me my first and best beloved,my dear departed wife, who is now a saint in heaven."Tant Sannie could not understand; but the Hottentot maid, who had takenher seat on the floor beside her mistress, translated the English intoDutch as far as she was able."Ah, my first, my beloved!" he added, looking tenderly down at thepicture. "Oh, the beloved, the beautiful lineaments! My angel wife! Thisis surely a sister of yours, madame?" he added, fixing his eyes on TantSannie.The Dutchwoman blushed, shook her head, and pointed to herself.Carefully, intently, Bonaparte looked from the picture in his hand toTant Sannie's features, and from the features back to the picture. Thenslowly a light broke over his countenance, he looked up, it becamea smile; he looked back at the miniature, his whole countenance waseffulgent."Ah, yes; I see it now," he cried, turning his delighted gaze on theBoer-woman; "eyes, mouth, nose, chin, the very expression!" he cried."How is it possible I did not notice it before?""Take another cup of coffee," said Tant Sannie. "Put some sugar in."Bonaparte hung the picture tenderly up, and was turning to take the cupfrom her hand, when the German appeared, to say that the pudding wasready and the meat on the table."He's a God-fearing man, and one who knows how to behave himself," saidthe Boer-woman as he went out at the door. "If he's ugly, did not theLord make him? And are we to laugh at the Lord's handiwork? It is betterto be ugly and good than pretty and bad; though of course it's nice whenone is both," said Tant Sannie, looking complacently at the picture onthe wall.In the afternoon the German and Bonaparte sat before the door of thecabin. Both smoked in complete silence--Bonaparte with a book in hishands and his eyes half closed; the German puffing vigorously, andglancing up now and again at the serene blue sky overhead."Supposing--you--you, in fact, made the remark to me," burst forth theGerman suddenly, "that you were looking for a situation."Bonaparte opened his mouth wide, and sent a stream of smoke through hislips."Now supposing," said the German--"merely supposing, of course--thatsome one, some one, in fact, should make an offer to you, say, to becomeschoolmaster on their farm and teach two children, two little girls,perhaps, and would give you forty pounds a year, would you accept it?Just supposing, of course.""Well, my dear friend," said Bonaparte, "that would depend oncircumstances. Money is no consideration with me. For my wife I havemade provision for the next year. My health is broken. Could I meet aplace where a gentleman would be treated as a gentleman I would acceptit, however small the remuneration. With me," said Bonaparte, "money isno consideration.""Well," said the German, when he had taken a whiff or two more from hispipe, "I think I shall go up and see Tant Sannie a little. I go up oftenon Sunday afternoon to have a general conversation, to see her, youknow. Nothing--nothing particular, you know."The old man put his book into his pocket, and walked up to the farmhousewith a peculiarly knowing and delighted expression of countenance."He doesn't suspect what I'm going to do," soliloquized the German;"hasn't the least idea. A nice surprise for him."The man whom he had left at his doorway winked at the retreating figurewith a wink that was not to be described.Chapter 1.VI. Bonaparte Blenkins Makes His Nest."Ah, what is the matter?" asked Waldo, stopping at the foot of theladder with a load of skins on his back that he was carrying up to theloft. Through the open door in the gable little Em was visible, herfeet dangling from the high bench on which she sat. The room, once astoreroom, had been divided by a row of mealie bags into two parts--theback being Bonaparte's bedroom, the front his schoolroom."Lyndall made him angry," said the girl tearfully; "and he has givenme the fourteenth of John to learn. He says he will teach me to behavemyself when Lyndall troubles him.""What did she do?" asked the boy."You see," said Em, hopelessly turning the leaves, "whenever he talksshe looks out at the door, as though she did not hear him. Todayshe asked him what the signs of the Zodiac were, and he said he wassurprised that she should ask him; it was not a fit and proper thing forlittle girls to talk about. Then she asked him who Copernicus was; andhe said he was one of the Emperors of Rome, who burned the Christians ina golden pig, and the worms ate him up while he was still alive. I don'tknow why," said Em plaintively, "but she just put her books under herarm and walked out; and she will never come to his school again, shesays, and she always does what she says. And now I must sit here everyday alone," said Em, the great tears dropping softly."Perhaps Tant Sannie will send him away," said the boy, in his mumblingway, trying to comfort her."No," said Em, shaking her head; "no. Last night when the littleHottentot maid was washing her feet, he told her he liked such feet, andthat fat women were so nice to him; and she said I must always put purecream in his coffee now. No; he'll never go away," said Em dolorously.The boy put down his skins and fumbled in his pocket, and produced asmall piece of paper containing something. He stuck it out toward her."There, take it for you," he said. This was by way of comfort.Em opened it and found a small bit of gum, a commodity prized by thechildren; but the great tears dropped down slowly on to it.Waldo was distressed. He had cried so much in his morsel of life thattears in another seemed to burn him."If," he said, stepping in awkwardly and standing by the table, "if youwill not cry I will tell you something--a secret.""What is that?" asked Em, instantly becoming decidedly better."You will tell it to no human being?""No."He bent nearer to her, and with deep solemnity said:"I have made a machine!"Em opened her eyes."Yes; a machine for shearing sheep. It is almost done," said the boy."There is only one thing that is not right yet; but it will be soon.When you think, and think, and think, all night and all day, it comes atlast," he added mysteriously."Where is it?""Here! I always carry it here," said the boy, putting his hand to hisbreast, where a bulging-out was visible. "This is a model. When it isdone they will have to make a large one.""Show it me."The boy shook his head."No, not till it is done. I cannot let any human being see it tillthen.""It is a beautiful secret," said Em; and the boy shuffled out to pick uphis skins.That evening father and son sat in the cabin eating their supper. Thefather sighed deeply sometimes. Perhaps he thought how long a time itwas since Bonaparte had visited the cabin; but his son was in that landin which sighs have no part. It is a question whether it were not betterto be the shabbiest of fools, and know the way up the little stairof imagination to the land of dreams, than the wisest of men, who seenothing that the eyes do not show, and feel nothing that the hands donot touch. The boy chewed his brown bread and drank his coffee; but intruth he saw only his machine finished--that last something found outand added. He saw it as it worked with beautiful smoothness; and overand above, as he chewed his bread and drank his coffee, there was thatdelightful consciousness of something bending over him and loving him.It would not have been better in one of the courts of heaven, where thewalls are set with rows of the King of Glory's amethysts and milk-whitepearls, than there, eating his supper in that little room.As they sat in silence there was a knock at the door. When it wasopened the small woolly head of a little nigger showed itself. She wasa messenger from Tant Sannie: the German was wanted at once at thehomestead. Putting on his hat with both hands, he hurried off. Thekitchen was in darkness, but in the pantry beyond Tant Sannie and hermaids were assembled.A Kaffer girl, who had been grinding pepper between two stones, knelton the floor, the lean Hottentot stood with a brass candlestick in herhand, and Tant Sannie, near the shelf, with a hand on each hip, wasevidently listening intently, as were her companions."What may be it?" cried the old German in astonishment. The room beyondthe pantry was the storeroom. Through the thin wooden partition therearose at that instant, evidently from some creature ensconced there, aprolonged and prodigious howl, followed by a succession of violent blowsagainst the partition wall.The German seized the churn-stick, and was about to rush round thehouse, when the Boer-woman impressively laid her hand upon his arm."That is his head," said Tant Sannie, "that is his head.""But what might it be?" asked the German, looking from one to the other,churn-stick in hand.A low hollow bellow prevented reply, and the voice of Bonaparte lifteditself on high."Mary-Ann! my angel! my wife!""Isn't it dreadful?" said Tant Sannie, as the blows were repeatedfiercely. "He has got a letter; his wife is dead. You must go andcomfort him," said Tant Sannie at last, "and I will go with you. Itwould not be the thing for me to go alone--me, who am only thirty-three,and he an unmarried man now," said Tant Sannie, blushing and smoothingout her apron.Upon this they all trudged round the house in company--the Hottentotmaid carrying the light, Tant Sannie and the German following, and theKaffer girl bringing up the rear."Oh," said Tant Sannie, "I see now it wasn't wickedness made him dowithout his wife so long--only necessity."At the door she motioned to the German to enter, and followed himclosely. On the stretcher behind the sacks Bonaparte lay on his face,his head pressed into a pillow, his legs kicking gently. The Boer-womansat down on a box at the foot of the bed. The German stood with foldedhands looking on."We must all die," said Tant Sannie at last; "it is the dear Lord'swill."Hearing her voice, Bonaparte turned himself on to his back."It's very hard," said Tant Sannie, "I know, for I've lost twohusbands."Bonaparte looked up into the German's face."Oh, what does she say? Speak to me words of comfort!"The German repeated Tant Sannie's remark."Ah, I--I also! Two dear, dear wives, whom I shall never see any more!"cried Bonaparte, flinging himself back upon the bed.He howled, till the tarantulas, who lived between the rafters and thezinc roof, felt the unusual vibration, and looked out with their wickedbright eyes, to see what was going on.Tant Sannie sighed, the Hottentot maid sighed, the Kaffer girl wholooked in at the door put her hand over her mouth and said "Mow-wah!""You must trust in the Lord," said Tant Sannie. "He can give you morethan you have lost.""I do, I do!" he cried; "but oh, I have no wife! I have no wife!"Tant Sannie was much affected, and came and stood near the bed."Ask him if he won't have a little pap--nice, fine, flour pap. There issome boiling on the kitchen fire."The German made the proposal, but the widower waved his hand."No, nothing shall pass my lips. I should be suffocated. No, no! Speaknot of food to me!""Pap, and a little brandy in," said Tant Sannie coaxingly.Bonaparte caught the word."Perhaps, perhaps--if I struggled with myself--for the sake of my dutiesI might imbibe a few drops," he said, looking with quivering lip up intothe German's face. "I must do my duty, must I not?"Tant Sannie gave the order, and the girl went for the pap."I know how it was when my first husband died. They could do nothingwith me," the Boer-woman said, "till I had eaten a sheep's trotter, andhoney, and a little roaster-cake. I know."Bonaparte sat up on the bed with his legs stretched out in front of him,and a hand on each knee, blubbering softly."Oh, she was a woman! You are very kind to try and comfort me, but shewas my wife. For a woman that is my wife I could live; for the womanthat is my wife I could die! For a woman that is my wife I could--Ah!that sweet word 'wife'; when will it rest upon my lips again?"When his feelings had subsided a little he raised the corners of histurned-down mouth, and spoke to the German with flabby lips."Do you think she understands me? Oh, tell her every word, that she mayknow I thank her."At that instant the girl reappeared with a basin of steaming gruel and ablack bottle.Tant Sannie poured some of its contents into the basin, stirred it well,and came to the bed."Oh, I can't, I can't! I shall die! I shall die!" said Bonaparte,putting his hands to his side."Come, just a little," said Tant Sannie coaxingly; "just a drop.""It's too thick, it's too thick. I should choke."Tant Sannie added from the contents of the bottle and held out aspoonful; Bonaparte opened his mouth like a little bird waiting for aworm, and held it open, as she dipped again and again into the pap."Ah, this will do your heart good," said Tant Sannie, in whose mind therelative functions of heart and stomach were exceedingly ill-defined.When the basin was emptied the violence of his grief was much assuaged;he looked at Tant Sannie with gentle tears."Tell him," said the Boer-woman, "that I hope he will sleep well, andthat the Lord will comfort him, as the Lord only can.""Bless you, dear friend, God bless you," said Bonaparte.When the door was safely shut on the German, the Hottentot, and theDutchwoman, he got off the bed and washed away the soap he had rubbed onhis eyelids."Bon," he said, slapping his leg, "you're the cutest lad I ever cameacross. If you don't turn out the old Hymns-and-prayers, and pummelthe Ragged coat, and get your arms round the fat one's waist and awedding-ring on her finger, then you are not Bonaparte. But you areBonaparte. Bon, you're a fine boy!"Making which pleasing reflection, he pulled off his trousers and gotinto bed cheerfully.Chapter 1.VII. He Sets His Trap."May I come in? I hope I do not disturb you, my dear friend," saidBonaparte, late one evening, putting his nose in at the cabin door,where the German and his son sat finishing their supper.It was now two months since he had been installed as schoolmaster inTant Sannie's household, and he had grown mighty and more mighty dayby day. He visited the cabin no more, sat close to Tant Sannie drinkingcoffee all the evening, and walked about loftily with his hands underthe coat-tails of the German's black cloth and failed to see even anigger who wished him a deferential good morning. It was therefore withno small surprise that the German perceived Bonaparte's red nose at thedoor."Walk in, walk in," he said joyfully. "Boy, boy, see if there is anycoffee left. Well, none. Make a fire. We have done supper, but--""My dear friend," said Bonaparte, taking off his hat, "I came notto sup, not for mere creature comforts, but for an hour of brotherlyintercourse with a kindred spirit. The press of business and the weightof thought, but they alone, may sometimes prevent me from sharing thesecrets of my bosom with him for whom I have so great a sympathy. Youperhaps wonder when I shall return the two pounds--""Oh, no, no! Make a fire, make a fire, boy. We will have a pot of hotcoffee presently," said the German, rubbing his hands and looking about,not knowing how best to show his pleasure at the unexpected visit.For three weeks the German's diffident "Good evening" had met with astately bow; the chin of Bonaparte lifting itself higher daily; and hisshadow had not darkened the cabin doorway since he came to borrow thetwo pounds. The German walked to the head of the bed and took down ablue bag that hung there. Blue bags were a speciality of the German's.He kept above fifty stowed away in different corners of his room--somefilled with curious stones, some with seeds that had been in hispossession fifteen years, some with rusty nails, buckles, and bits ofold harness--in all, a wonderful assortment, but highly prized."We have something here not so bad," said the German, smiling knowingly,as he dived his hand into the bag and took out a handful of almonds andraisins; "I buy these for my chickens. They increase in size, but theystill think the old man must have something nice for them. And the oldman--well, a big boy may have a sweet tooth sometimes, may he not? Ha,ha!" said the German, chuckling at his own joke, as he heaped the platewith almonds. "Here is a stone--two stones to crack them--no late patentimprovement--well, Adam's nut-cracker; ha, ha! But I think we shalldo. We will not leave them uncracked. We will consume a few withoutfashionable improvements."Here the German sat down on one side of the table, Bonaparte on theother; each one with a couple of flat stones before him, and the platebetween them."Do not be afraid," said the German, "do not be afraid. I do not forgetthe boy at the fire; I crack for him. The bag is full. Why, this isstrange," he said suddenly, cracking upon a large nut; "three kernels! Ihave not observed that before. This must be retained. This is valuable."He wrapped the nut gravely in paper, and put it carefully in hiswaistcoat pocket. "Valuable, very valuable!" he said, shaking his head."Ah, my friend," said Bonaparte, "what joy it is to be once more in yoursociety."The German's eyes glistened, and Bonaparte seized his hand and squeezedit warmly. They then proceeded to crack and eat. After a while Bonapartesaid, stuffing a handful of raisins into his mouth:"I was so deeply grieved, my dear friend, that you and Tant Sannie hadsome slight unpleasantness this evening.""Oh, no, no," said the German; "it is all right now. A few sheepmissing; but I make it good myself. I give my twelve sheep, and work inthe other eight.""It is rather hard that you should have to make good the lost sheep,"said Bonaparte; "it is no fault of yours.""Well," said the German, "this is the case. Last evening I count thesheep at the kraal--twenty are missing. I ask the herd; he tells me theyare with the other flock; he tells me so distinctly; how can I think helies? This afternoon I count the other flock. The sheep are not there. Icome back here: the herd is gone; the sheep are gone. But I cannot--no,I will not--believe he stole them," said the German, growing suddenlyexcited. "Some one else, but not he. I know that boy. I knew him threeyears. He is a good boy. I have seen him deeply affected on account ofhis soul. And she would send the police after him! I say I would rathermake the loss good myself. I will not have it; he has fled in fear.I know his heart. It was," said the German, with a little gentlehesitation, "under my words that he first felt his need of a Saviour."Bonaparte cracked some more almonds, then said, yawning, and more asthough he asked for the sake of having something to converse about thanfrom any interest he felt in the subject:"And what has become of the herd's wife?"The German was alight again in a moment."Yes; his wife. She has a child six days old, and Tant Sannie would turnher out into the fields this night. That," said the German rising, "thatis what I call cruelty--diabolical cruelty. My soul abhors that deed.The man that could do such a thing I could run him through with aknife!" said the German, his grey eyes flashing, and his bushy blackbeard adding to the murderous fury of his aspect. Then suddenlysubsiding, he said, "But all is now well; Tant Sannie gives her wordthat the maid shall remain for some days. I go to Oom Muller's tomorrowto learn if the sheep may not be there. If they are not, then I return.They are gone, that is all. I make it good.""Tant Sannie is a singular woman," said Bonaparte, taking the tobaccobag the German passed to him."Singular! Yes," said the German; "but her heart is on her right side.I have lived long years with her, and I may say, I have for her anaffection, which she returns. I may say," added the German with warmth,"I may say, that there is not one soul on this farm for whom I have notan affection.""Ah, my friend," said Bonaparte, "when the grace of God is in ourhearts, is it not with us all? Do we not love the very worm we treadupon, and as we tread upon it? Do we know distinctions of race, or ofsex, or of colour? No!     "'Love so amazing, so divine,       It fills my soul, my life, my all.'"After a time he sank into a less fervent mood, and remarked:"The coloured female who waits upon Tant Sannie appears to be of avirtuous disposition, an individual who--""Virtuous!" said the German; "I have confidence in her. There is that inher which is pure, that which is noble. The rich and high that walk thisearth with lofty eyelids might exchange with her."The German here got up to bring a coal for Bonaparte's pipe, and theysat together talking for a while. At length Bonaparte knocked the ashesout of his pipe."It is time that I took my departure, dear friend," he said; "but,before I do so, shall we not close this evening of sweet communion andbrotherly intercourse by a few words of prayer? Oh, how good and howpleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It islike the dew upon the mountains of Hermon; for there the Lord bestowed ablessing, even life for evermore.""Stay and drink some coffee," said the German."No, thank you, my friend; I have business that must be done tonight,"said Bonaparte. "Your dear son appears to have gone to sleep. He isgoing to take the wagon to the mill tomorrow! What a little man he is.""A fine boy."But though the boy nodded before the fire he was not asleep; and theyall knelt down to pray.When they rose from their knees Bonaparte extended his hand to Waldo,and patted him on the head."Good night, my lad," said he. "As you go to the mill tomorrow, we shallnot see you for some days. Good night! Good-bye! The Lord bless andguide you; and may He bring you back to us in safety and find us all asyou have left us!" He laid some emphasis on the last words. "And you,my dear friend," he added, turning with redoubled warmth to the German,"long, long shall I look back to this evening as a time of refreshingfrom the presence of the Lord, as an hour of blessed intercourse with abrother in Jesus. May such often return. The Lord bless you!" he added,with yet deeper fervour, "richly, richly."Then he opened the door and vanished out into the darkness."He, he, he!" laughed Bonaparte, as he stumbled over the stones. "Ifthere isn't the rarest lot of fools on this farm that ever God Almightystuck legs to. He, he, he! When the worms come out then the blackbirdsfeed. Ha, ha, ha!" Then he drew himself up; even when alone he liked topose with a certain dignity; it was second nature to him.He looked in at the kitchen door. The Hottentot maid who acted asinterpreter between Tant Sannie and himself was gone, and Tant Sannieherself was in bed."Never mind, Bon, my boy," he said, as he walked round to his own room,"tomorrow will do. He, he, he!"Chapter 1.VIII. He Catches the Old Bird.At four o'clock the next afternoon the German rode across the plain,returning from his search for the lost sheep. He rode slowly, for he hadbeen in the saddle since sunrise and was somewhat weary, and the heatof the afternoon made his horse sleepy as it picked its way slowly alongthe sandy road. Every now and then a great red spider would start outof the karoo on one side of the path and run across to the other, butnothing else broke the still monotony. Presently, behind one of thehighest of the milk-bushes that dotted the roadside, the German caughtsight of a Kaffer woman, seated there evidently for such shadow as themilk-bush might afford from the sloping rays of the sun.The German turned the horse's head out of the road. It was not his wayto pass a living creature without a word of greeting. Coming nearer, hefound it was no other than the wife of the absconding Kaffer herd. Shehad a baby tied on her back by a dirty strip of red blanket; anotherstrip hardly larger was twisted round her waist, for the rest her blackbody was naked. She was a sullen, ill-looking woman with lips hideouslyprotruding.The German questioned her as to how she came there. She muttered inbroken Dutch that she had been turned away. Had she done evil? She shookher head sullenly. Had she had food given her? She grunted a negative,and fanned the flies from her baby. Telling the woman to remain whereshe was, he turned his horse's head to the road and rode off at afurious pace."Hard-hearted! cruel! Oh, my God! Is this the way? Is this charity?""Yes, yes, yes," ejaculated the old man as he rode on; but, presently,his anger began to evaporate, his horse's pace slackened, and by thetime he had reached his own door he was nodding and smiling.Dismounting quickly, he went to the great chest where his provisionswere kept. Here he got out a little meal, a little mealies, a fewroaster-cakes. These he tied up in three blue handkerchiefs, and puttingthem into a sailcloth bag, he strung them over his shoulders. Then helooked circumspectly out at the door. It was very bad to be discoveredin the act of giving; it made him red up to the roots of his oldgrizzled hair. No one was about, however, so he rode off again. Besidethe milk-bush sat the Kaffer woman still--like Hagar, he thought, thrustout by her mistress in the wilderness to die. Telling her to loosen thehandkerchief from her head, he poured into it the contents of his bag.The woman tied it up in sullen silence."You must try and get to the next farm," said the German.The woman shook her head; she would sleep in the field.The German reflected. Kaffer women were accustomed to sleep in the openair; but then, the child was small, and after so hot a day the nightmight be chilly. That she would creep back to the huts at the homesteadwhen the darkness favoured her, the German's sagacity did not makeevident to him. He took off the old brown salt-and-pepper coat, and heldit out to her. The woman received it in silence, and laid it across herknee. "With that they will sleep warmly; not so bad. Ha, ha!" said theGerman. And he rode home, nodding his head in a manner that would havemade any other man dizzy."I wish he would not come back tonight," said Em, her face wet withtears."It will be just the same if he comes back tomorrow," said Lyndall.The two girls sat on the step of the cabin weeping for the German'sreturn. Lyndall shaded her eyes with her hand from the sunset light."There he comes," she said, "whistling 'Ach Jerusalem du schone' so loudI can hear him from here.""Perhaps he has found the sheep.""Found them!" said Lyndall. "He would whistle just so if he knew he hadto die tonight.""You look at the sunset, eh, chickens?" the German said, as he cameup at a smart canter. "Ah, yes, that is beautiful!" he added, as hedismounted, pausing for a moment with his hand on the saddle to lookat the evening sky, where the sun shot up long flaming streaks, betweenwhich and the eye thin yellow clouds floated. "Ei! you weep?" said theGerman, as the girls ran up to him.Before they had time to reply the voice of Tant Sannie was heard."You child, of the child, of the child of a Kaffer's dog, come here!"The German looked up. He thought the Dutchwoman, come out to coolherself in the yard, called to some misbehaving servant. The old manlooked round to see who it might be."You old vagabond of a praying German, are you deaf?"Tant Sannie stood before the steps of the kitchen; upon them sat thelean Hottentot, upon the highest stood Bonaparte Blenkins, both handsfolded under the tails of his coat, and his eyes fixed on the sunsetsky.The German dropped the saddle on the ground."Bish, bish, bish! what may this be?" he said, and walked toward thehouse. "Very strange!"The girls followed him: Em still weeping; Lyndall with her face ratherwhite and her eyes wide open."And I have the heart of a devil, did you say? You could run me throughwith a knife, could you?" cried the Dutchwoman. "I could not drive theKaffer maid away because I was afraid of you, was I? Oh, you miserablerag! I loved you, did I? I would have liked to marry you, would I? wouldI? WOULD I?" cried the Boer-woman; "you cat's tail, you dog's paw! Benear my house tomorrow morning when the sun rises," she gasped, "myKaffers will drag you through the sand. They would do it gladly, any ofthem, for a bit of tobacco, for all your prayings with them.""I am bewildered, I am bewildered," said the German, standing before herand raising his hand to his forehead; "I--I do not understand.""Ask him, ask him?" cried Tant Sannie, pointing to Bonaparte; "he knows.You thought he could not make me understand, but he did, he did, youold fool! I know enough English for that. You be here," shouted theDutchwoman, "when the morning star rises, and I will let my Kaffers takeyou out and drag you, till there is not one bone left in your old bodythat is not broken as fine as bobootie-meat, you old beggar! All yourrags are not worth that--they should be thrown out onto the ash-heap,"cried the Boer-woman; "but I will have them for my sheep. Not one rottenhoof of your old mare do you take with you; I will have her--all, allfor my sheep that you have lost, you godless thing!"The Boer-woman wiped the moisture from her mouth with the palm of herhand.The German turned to Bonaparte, who still stood on the step absorbed inthe beauty of the sunset."Do not address me; do not approach me, lost man," said Bonaparte, notmoving his eye nor lowering his chin. "There is a crime from which allnature revolts; there is a crime whose name is loathsome to the humanear--that crime is yours; that crime is ingratitude. This woman has beenyour benefactress; on her farm you have lived; after her sheep you havelooked; into her house you have been allowed to enter and hold Divineservice--an honour of which you were never worthy; and how have yourewarded her?--basely, basely, basely!""But it is all false, lies and falsehoods. I must, I will speak," saidthe German, suddenly looking round bewildered. "Do I dream? Are you mad?What may it be?""Go, dog," cried the Dutchwoman; "I would have been a rich woman thisday if it had not been for your laziness. Praying with the Kaffersbehind the kraal walls. Go, you Kaffer's dog!""But what then is the matter? What may have happened since I left?" saidthe German, turning to the Hottentot woman, who sat upon the step.She was his friend; she would tell him kindly the truth. The womananswered by a loud, ringing laugh."Give it him, old missis! Give it him!"It was so nice to see the white man who had been master hunted down. Thecoloured woman laughed, and threw a dozen mealie grains into her mouthto chew.All anger and excitement faded from the old man's face. He turned slowlyaway and walked down the little path to his cabin, with his shouldersbent; it was all dark before him. He stumbled over the threshold of hisown well-known door.Em, sobbing bitterly, would have followed him; but the Boer-womanprevented her by a flood of speech which convulsed the Hottentot, so lowwere its images."Come, Em," said Lyndall, lifting her small proud head, "let us go in.We will not stay to hear such language."She looked into the Boer-woman's eyes. Tant Sannie understood themeaning of the look if not the words. She waddled after them, and caughtEm by the arm. She had struck Lyndall once years before, and had neverdone it again, so she took Em."So you will defy me, too, will you, you Englishman's ugliness!" shecried, and with one hand she forced the child down, and held her headtightly against her knee; with the other she beat her first upon onecheek, and then upon the other.For one instant Lyndall looked on, then she laid her small fingers onthe Boer-woman's arm. With the exertion of half its strength Tant Sanniemight have flung the girl back upon the stones. It was not the powerof the slight fingers, tightly though they clinched her broad wrist--sotightly that at bedtime the marks were still there; but the Boer-womanlooked into the clear eyes and at the quivering white lips, and with ahalf-surprised curse relaxed her hold. The girl drew Em's arm throughher own."Move!" she said to Bonaparte, who stood in the door, and he, Bonapartethe invincible, in the hour of his triumph, moved to give her place.The Hottentot ceased to laugh, and an uncomfortable silence fell on allthe three in the doorway.Once in their room, Em sat down on the floor and wailed bitterly.Lyndall lay on the bed with her arm drawn across her eyes, very whiteand still."Hoo, hoo!" cried Em; "and they won't let him take the grey mare; andWaldo has gone to the mill. Hoo, hoo, and perhaps they won't let us goand say good-bye to him. Hoo, hoo, hoo!""I wish you would be quiet," said Lyndall without moving. "Does it giveyou such felicity to let Bonaparte know he is hurting you? We will askno one. It will be suppertime soon. Listen--and when you hear the clinkof the knives and forks we will go out and see him."Em suppressed her sobs and listened intently, kneeling at the door.Suddenly some one came to the window and put the shutter up."Who was that?" said Lyndall, starting."The girl, I suppose," said Em. "How early she is this evening!"But Lyndall sprang from the bed and seized the handle of the door,shaking it fiercely. The door was locked on the outside. She ground herteeth."What is the matter?" asked Em.The room was in perfect darkness now."Nothing," said Lyndall quietly; "only they have locked us in."She turned, and went back to bed again. But ere long Em heard a sound ofmovement. Lyndall had climbed up into the window, and with her fingersfelt the woodwork that surrounded the panes. Slipping down, the girlloosened the iron knob from the foot of the bedstead, and climbing upagain she broke with it every pane of glass in the window, beginning atthe top and ending at the bottom."What are you doing?" asked Em, who heard the falling fragments.Her companion made her no reply; but leaned on every little cross-bar,which cracked and gave way beneath her. Then she pressed with all herstrength against the shutter. She had thought the wooden buttons wouldgive way, but by the clinking sound she knew that the iron bar had beenput across. She was quite quiet for a time. Clambering down, she tookfrom the table a small one-bladed penknife, with which she began to peckat the hard wood of the shutter."What are you doing now?" asked Em, who had ceased crying in her wonder,and had drawn near."Trying to make a hole," was the short reply."Do you think you will be able to?""No; but I am trying."In an agony of suspense Em waited. For ten minutes Lyndall pecked. Thehole was three-eighths of an inch deep--then the blade sprung into tenpieces."What has happened now?" Em asked, blubbering afresh."Nothing," said Lyndall. "Bring me my nightgown, a piece of paper, andthe matches."Wondering, Em fumbled about till she found them."What are you going to do with them?" she whispered."Burn down the window.""But won't the whole house take fire and burn down too?""Yes.""But will it not be very wicked?""Yes, very. And I do not care."She arranged the nightgown carefully in the corner of the window, withthe chips of the frame about it. There was only one match in the box.She drew it carefully along the wall. For a moment it burnt up blue, andshowed the tiny face with its glistening eyes. She held it carefully tothe paper. For an instant it burnt up brightly, then flickered and wentout. She blew the spark, but it died also. Then she threw the paper onto the ground, trod on it, and went to her bed, and began to undress.Em rushed to the door, knocking against it wildly."Oh, Tant Sannie! Tant Sannie! Oh, let us out!" she cried. "Oh, Lyndall,what are we to do?"Lyndall wiped a drop of blood off the lip she had bitten."I am going to sleep," she said. "If you like to sit there and howl tillthe morning, do. Perhaps you will find that it helps; I never heard thathowling helped any one."Long after, when Em herself had gone to bed and was almost asleep,Lyndall came and stood at her bedside."Here," she said, slipping a little pot of powder into her hand; "rubsome on to your face. Does it not burn where she struck you?"Then she crept back to her own bed. Long, long after, when Em was reallyasleep, she lay still awake, and folded her hands on her little breast,and muttered--"When that day comes, and I am strong, I will hate everything that haspower, and help everything that is weak." And she bit her lip again.The German looked out at the cabin door for the last time that night.Then he paced the room slowly and sighed. Then he drew out pen andpaper, and sat down to write, rubbing his old grey eyes with hisknuckles before he began."My Chickens: You did not come to say good-bye to the old man. Mightyou? Ah, well, there is a land where they part no more, where saintsimmortal reign."I sit here alone, and I think of you. Will you forget the old man? Whenyou wake tomorrow he will be far away. The old horse is lazy, but he hashis stick to help him; that is three legs. He comes back one day withgold and diamonds. Will you welcome him? Well, we shall see. I go tomeet Waldo. He comes back with the wagon; then he follows me. Poor boy?God knows. There is a land where all things are made right, but thatland is not here."My little children, serve the Saviour; give your hearts to Him whileyou are yet young. Life is short."Nothing is mine, otherwise I would say, Lyndall, take my books, Em mystones. Now I say nothing. The things are mine: it is not righteous, Godknows? But I am silent. Let it be. But I feel it, I must say I feel it."Do not cry too much for the old man. He goes out to seek his fortune,and comes back with it in a bag, it may be."I love my children. Do they think of me? I am Old Otto, who goes out toseek his fortune."O.F."Having concluded this quaint production, he put it where the childrenwould find it the next morning, and proceeded to prepare his bundle. Henever thought of entering a protest against the loss of his goods; likea child, he submitted, and wept. He had been there eleven years, and itwas hard to go away. He spread open on the bed a blue handkerchief,and on it put one by one the things he thought most necessary andimportant--a little bag of curious seeds, which he meant to plant someday, an old German hymn-book, three misshapen stones that he greatlyvalued, a Bible, a shirt and two handkerchiefs; then there was room fornothing more. He tied up the bundle tightly and put it on a chair by hisbedside."That is not much; they cannot say I take much," he said, looking at it.He put his knotted stick beside it, his blue tobacco bag and his shortpipe, and then inspected his coats. He had two left--a moth-eatenovercoat and a black alpaca, out at the elbows. He decided for theovercoat; it was warm, certainly, but then he could carry it over hisarm and only put it on when he met some one along the road. It was morerespectable than the black alpaca.He hung the greatcoat over the back of the chair, and stuffed a hard bitof roaster-cake under the knot of the bundle, and then his preparationswere completed. The German stood contemplating them with muchsatisfaction. He had almost forgotten his sorrow at leaving in hispleasure at preparing. Suddenly he started; an expression of intensepain passed over his face. He drew back his left arm quickly, and thenpressed his right hand upon his breast."Ah, the sudden pang again," he said.His face was white, but it quickly regained its colour. Then the old manbusied himself in putting everything right."I will leave it neat. They shall not say I did not leave it neat," hesaid. Even the little bags of seeds on the mantelpiece he put in rowsand dusted. Then he undressed and got into bed. Under his pillow wasa little storybook. He drew it forth. To the old German a story wasno story. Its events were as real and as important to himself as thematters of his own life.He could not go away without knowing whether that wicked earl relentedand whether the baron married Emilina. So he adjusted his spectacles andbegan to read. Occasionally, as his feelings became too strongly moved,he ejaculated: "Ah, I thought so! That was a rogue! I saw it before! Iknew it from the beginning!" More than half an hour had passed when helooked up to the silver watch at the top of his bed."The march is long tomorrow; this will not do," he said, taking off hisspectacles and putting them carefully into the book to mark the place."This will be good reading as I walk along tomorrow," he added, as hestuffed the book into the pocket of the greatcoat; "very good reading."He nodded his head and lay down. He thought a little of his owntroubles, a good deal of the two little girls he was leaving, of theearl, of Emilina, of the baron; but he was soon asleep--sleeping aspeacefully as a little child, upon whose innocent soul sorrow and carecannot rest.It was very quiet in the room. The coals in the fireplace threw a dullred light across the floor upon the red lions on the quilt. Eleveno'clock came, and the room was very still.One o'clock came. The glimmer had died out, though the ashes were stillwarm, and the room was very dark. The grey mouse, who had his hole underthe toolbox, came out and sat on the sacks in the corner; then, growingbolder, the room was so dark, it climbed the chair at the bedside,nibbled at the roaster-cake, took one bite quickly at the candle, andthen sat on his haunches listening. It heard the even breathing of theold man, and the steps of the hungry Kaffer dog going his last roundin search of a bone or a skin that had been forgotten; and it heard thewhite hen call out as the wild cat ran away with one of her brood, andit heard the chicken cry. Then the grey mouse went back to its holeunder the toolbox, and the room was quiet. And two o'clock came. By thattime the night was grown dull and cloudy. The wild cat had gone to itshome on the kopje; the Kaffer dog had found a bone, and lay gnawing it.An intense quiet reigned everywhere. Only in her room the Boer-womantossed her great arms in her sleep; for she dreamed that a dark shadowwith outstretched wings fled slowly over her house, and she moaned andshivered. And the night was very still.But, quiet as all places were, there was a quite peculiar quiet in theGerman's room. Though you strained your ear most carefully you caught nosound of breathing.He was not gone, for the old coat still hung on the chair--the coatthat was to be put on when he met any one; and the bundle and stick wereready for tomorrow's long march. The old German himself lay there, hiswavy black hair just touched with grey thrown back upon the pillow.The old face was lying there alone in the dark, smiling like a littlechild's--oh, so peacefully. There is a stranger whose coming, they say,is worse than all the ills of life, from whose presence we flee awaytrembling; but he comes very tenderly sometimes. And it seemed almost asthough Death had known and loved the old man, so gently it touched him.And how could it deal hardly with him--the loving, simple, childlike oldman?So it smoothed out the wrinkles that were in the old forehead, and fixedthe passing smile, and sealed the eyes that they might not weep again;and then the short sleep of time was melted into the long, long sleep ofeternity."How has he grown so young in this one night?" they said when they foundhim in the morning.Yes, dear old man; to such as you time brings no age. You die with thepurity and innocence of your childhood upon you, though you die in yourgrey hairs.Chapter 1.IX. He Sees A Ghost.Bonaparte stood on the ash-heap. He espied across the plain a movingspeck and he chucked his coat-tails up and down in expectancy of ascene.The wagon came on slowly. Waldo laid curled among the sacks at theback of the wagon, the hand in his breast resting on the sheep-shearingmachine. It was finished now. The right thought had struck him theday before as he sat, half asleep, watching the water go over themill-wheel. He muttered to himself with half-closed eyes:"Tomorrow smooth the cogs--tighten the screws a little--show it tothem." Then after a pause--"Over the whole world--the whole world--mine,that I have made!" He pressed the little wheels and pulleys in hispocket till they cracked. Presently his muttering became louder--"Andfifty pounds--a black hat for my dadda--for Lyndall a blue silk,very light; and one purple like the earth-bells, and white shoes." Hemuttered on--"A box full, full of books. They shall tell me all, all,all," he added, moving his fingers desiringly: "why the crystals grow insuch beautiful shapes; why lightning runs to the iron; why black peopleare black; why the sunlight makes things warm. I shall read, read,read," he muttered slowly. Then came over him suddenly what he called"The presence of God"; a sense of a good, strong something folding himround. He smiled through his half-shut eyes. "Ah, Father, my own Father,it is so sweet to feel you, like the warm sunshine. The Bibles and bookscannot tell of you and all I feel you. They are mixed with men's words;but you--"His muttering sank into inaudible confusion, till, opening his eyeswide, it struck him that the brown plain he looked at was the old homefarm. For half an hour they had been riding in it, and he had not knownit. He roused the leader, who sat nodding on the front of the wagonin the early morning sunlight. They were within half a mile of thehomestead. It seemed to him that he had been gone from them all a year.He fancied he could see Lyndall standing on the brick wall to watch forhim; his father, passing from one house to the other, stopping to look.He called aloud to the oxen. For each one at home he had broughtsomething. For his father a piece of tobacco, bought at the shop by themill; for Em a thimble; for Lyndall a beautiful flower dug out bythe roots, at a place where they had outspanned; for Tant Sannie ahandkerchief. When they drew near the house he threw the whip tothe Kaffer leader, and sprung from the side of the wagon to run on.Bonaparte stopped him as he ran past the ash-heap."Good morning, my dear boy. Where are you running to so fast with yourrosy cheeks?"The boy looked up at him, glad even to see Bonaparte."I am going to the cabin," he said, out of breath."You won't find them in just now--not your good old father," saidBonaparte."Where is he?" asked the lad."There, beyond the camps," said Bonaparte, waving his hand oratoricallytoward the stone-walled ostrich-camps."What is he doing there?" asked the boy.Bonaparte patted him on the cheek kindly."We could not keep him any more, it was too hot. We've buried him,my boy," said Bonaparte, touching with his finger the boy's cheek. "Wecouldn't keep him any more. He, he, he!" laughed Bonaparte, as the boyfled away along the low stone wall, almost furtively, as one in fear.*****At five o'clock Bonaparte knelt before a box in the German's room. Hewas busily unpacking it.It had been agreed upon between Tant Sannie and himself, that now theGerman was gone he, Bonaparte, was to be no longer schoolmaster, butoverseer of the farm. In return for his past scholastic labours he hadexpressed himself willing to take possession of the dead man's goodsand room. Tant Sannie hardly liked the arrangement. She had a greatdeal more respect for the German dead than the German living, and wouldrather his goods had been allowed to descend peacefully to his son. Forshe was a firm believer in the chinks in the world above, where not onlyears, but eyes might be applied to see how things went on in this worldbelow. She never felt sure how far the spirit-world might overlap thisworld of sense, and, as a rule, prudently abstained from doing anythingwhich might offend unseen auditors. For this reason she abstained fromill-using the dead Englishman's daughter and niece, and for this reasonshe would rather the boy had had his father's goods. But it was hard torefuse Bonaparte anything when she and he sat so happily together in theevening drinking coffee, Bonaparte telling her in the broken Dutch hewas fast learning how he adored fat women, and what a splendid farmer hewas.So at five o'clock on this afternoon Bonaparte knelt in the German'sroom."Somewhere, here it is," he said, as he packed the old clothes carefullyout of the box, and, finding nothing, packed them in again. "Somewherein this room it is; and if it's here Bonaparte finds it," he repeated."You didn't stay here all these years without making a little pilesomewhere, my lamb. You weren't such a fool as you looked. Oh, no!" saidBonaparte.He now walked about the room, diving his fingers in everywhere: stickingthem into the great crevices in the wall and frightening out thespiders; rapping them against the old plaster till it cracked and fellin pieces; peering up the chimney, till the soot dropped on his baldhead and blackened it. He felt in little blue bags; he tried to raisethe hearth-stone; he shook each book, till the old leaves fell down inshowers on the floor.It was getting dark, and Bonaparte stood with his finger on his nosereflecting. Finally he walked to the door, behind which hung thetrousers and waistcoat the dead man had last worn. He had felt in them,but hurriedly, just after the funeral the day before; he would examinethem again. Sticking his fingers into the waistcoat pockets, he found inone corner a hole. Pressing his hand through it, between the lining andthe cloth, he presently came into contact with something. Bonaparte drewit forth--a small, square parcel, sewed up in sail-cloth. He gazed atit, squeezed it; it cracked, as though full of bank-notes. He put itquickly into his own waistcoat pocket, and peeped over the half-door tosee if there was any one coming. There was nothing to be seen but thelast rays of yellow sunset light, painting the karoo bushes in theplain, and shining on the ash-heap, where the fowls were pecking. Heturned and sat down on the nearest chair, and, taking out his pen-knife,ripped the parcel open. The first thing that fell was a shower of yellowfaded papers. Bonaparte opened them carefully one by one, and smoothedthem out on his knee. There was something very valuable to be hidden socarefully, though the German characters he could not decipher. When hecame to the last one, he felt there was something hard in it."You've got it, Bon, my boy! you've got it!" he cried, slapping his leghard. Edging nearer to the door, for the light was fading, he opened thepaper carefully. There was nothing inside but a plain gold wedding-ring."Better than nothing!" said Bonaparte, trying to put it on his littlefinger, which, however, proved too fat.He took it off and set it down on the table before him, and looked at itwith his crosswise eyes."When that auspicious hour, Sannie," he said, "shall have arrived, when,panting, I shall lead thee, lighted by Hymen's torch, to the connubialaltar, then upon thy fair amaranthine finger, my joyous bride, shallthis ring repose.     "Thy fair body, oh, my girl,      Shall Bonaparte possess;      His fingers in thy money-bags,      He therein, too, shall mess."Having given utterance to this flood of poesy, he sat lost in joyousreflection."He therein, too, shall mess," he repeated meditatively.At this instant, as Bonaparte swore, and swore truly to the end of hislife, a slow and distinct rap was given on the crown of his bald head.Bonaparte started and looked up. No riem or strap, hung down fromthe rafters above, and not a human creature was near the door. Itwas growing dark; he did not like it. He began to fold up the papersexpeditiously. He stretched out his hand for the ring. The ring wasgone! Gone, although no human creature had entered the room; gone,although no form had crossed the doorway. Gone!He would not sleep there, that was certain.He stuffed the papers into his pocket. As he did so, three slow anddistinct taps were given on the crown of his head. Bonaparte's jaw fell:each separate joint lost its power: he could not move; he dared notrise; his tongue lay loose in his mouth."Take all, take all!" he gurgled in his throat. "I--I do not want them.Take"--Here a resolute tug at the grey curls at the back of his head caused himto leap up, yelling wildly. Was he to sit still paralyzed, to be draggedaway bodily to the devil? With terrific shrieks he fled, casting noglance behind.*****When the dew was falling, and the evening was dark, a small figure movedtoward the gate of the furthest ostrich-camp, driving a bird before it.When the gate was opened and the bird driven in and the gate fastened,it turned away, but then suddenly paused near the stone wall."Is that you, Waldo?" said Lyndall, hearing a sound.The boy was sitting on the damp ground with his back to the wall. Hegave her no answer."Come," she said, bending over him, "I have been looking for you allday."He mumbled something."You have had nothing to eat. I have put some supper in your room. Youmust come home with me, Waldo."She took his hand, and the boy rose slowly.She made him take her arm, and twisted her small fingers among his."You must forget," she whispered. "Since it happened I walk, I talk,I never sit still. If we remember, we cannot bring back the dead." Sheknit her little fingers closer among his. "Forgetting is the best thing.He did watch it coming," she whispered presently. "That is the dreadfulthing, to see it coming!" She shuddered. "I want it to come so to metoo. Why do you think I was driving that bird?" she added quickly. "Thatwas Hans, the bird that hates Bonaparte. I let him out this afternoon; Ithought he would chase him and perhaps kill him."The boy showed no sign of interest."He did not catch him; but he put his head over the half-door of yourcabin and frightened him horribly. He was there, busy stealing yourthings. Perhaps he will leave them alone now; but I wish the bird hadtrodden on him."They said no more till they reached the door of the cabin."There is a candle and supper on the table. You must eat," she saidauthoritatively. "I cannot stay with you now, lest they find out aboutthe bird."He grasped her arm and brought his mouth close to her ear."There is no God!" he almost hissed; "no God; not anywhere!"She started."Not anywhere!"He ground it out between his teeth, and she felt his hot breath on hercheek."Waldo, you are mad," she said, drawing herself from him, instinctively.He loosened his grasp and turned away from her also.In truth, is it not life's way? We fight our little battles alone; youyours, I mine. We must not help or find help.When your life is most real, to me you are mad; when your agony isblackest, I look at you and wonder. Friendship is good, a strong stick;but when the hour comes to lean hard, it gives. In the day of theirbitterest need all souls are alone.Lyndall stood by him in the dark, pityingly, wonderingly. As he walkedto the door, she came after him."Eat your supper; it will do you good," she said.She rubbed her cheek against his shoulder and then ran away.In the front room the little woolly Kaffer girl was washing TantSannie's feet in a small tub, and Bonaparte, who sat on the woodensofa, was pulling off his shoes and stockings that his own feet mightbe washed also. There were three candles burning in the room, and he andTant Sannie sat close together, with the lean Hottentot not far off; forwhen ghosts are about much light is needed, there is great strengthin numbers. Bonaparte had completely recovered from the effects of hisfright in the afternoon, and the numerous doses of brandy that it hadbeen necessary to administer to him to effect his restoration had puthim into a singularly pleasant and amiable mood."That boy Waldo," said Bonaparte, rubbing his toes, "took himself offcoolly this morning as soon as the wagon came, and has not done a stiverof work all day. I'll not have that kind of thing now I'm master of thisfarm."The Hottentot maid translated."Ah, I expect he's sorry that his father's dead," said Tant Sannie."It's nature, you know. I cried the whole morning when my father died.One can always get another husband, but one can't get another father,"said Tant Sannie, casting a sidelong glance at Bonaparte.Bonaparte expressed a wish to give Waldo his orders for the next day'swork, and accordingly the little woolly-headed Kaffer was sent tocall him. After a considerable time the boy appeared, and stood in thedoorway.If they had dressed him in one of the swallow-tailed coats, and oiledhis hair till the drops fell from it, and it lay as smooth as an elder'son sacrament Sunday, there would still have been something unanointed inthe aspect of the fellow. As it was, standing there in his strange oldcostume, his head presenting much the appearance of having been deeplyrolled in sand, his eyelids swollen, the hair hanging over hisforehead, and a dogged sullenness on his features, he presented most theappearance of an ill-conditioned young buffalo."Beloved Lord," cried Tant Sannie, "how he looks! Come in, boy. Couldn'tyou come and say good-day to me? Don't you want some supper?"He said he wanted nothing, and turned his heavy eyes away from her."There's a ghost been seen in your father's room," said Tant Sannie. "Ifyou're afraid you can sleep in the kitchen.""I will sleep in our room," said the boy slowly."Well, you can go now," she said; "but be up early to take the sheep.The herd--""Yes, be up early, my boy," interrupted Bonaparte, smiling. "I am tobe master of this farm now; and we shall be good friends, I trust, verygood friends, if you try to do your duty, my dear boy."Waldo turned to go, and Bonaparte, looking benignly at the candle,stretched out one unstockinged foot, over which Waldo, looking atnothing in particular, fell with a heavy thud upon the floor."Dear me! I hope you are not hurt, my boy," said Bonaparte. "You'll havemany a harder thing than that though, before you've gone through life,"he added consolingly, as Waldo picked himself up.The lean Hottentot laughed till the room rang again; and Tant Sannietittered till her sides ached.When he had gone the little maid began to wash Bonaparte's feet."Oh, Lord, beloved Lord, how he did fall! I can't think of it," criedTant Sannie, and she laughed again. "I always did know he was not right;but this evening any one could see it," she added, wiping the tears ofmirth from her face. "His eyes are as wild as if the devil was in them.He never was like other children. The dear Lord knows, if he doesn'twalk alone for hours talking to himself. If you sit in the room withhim you can see his lips moving the whole time; and if you talk to himtwenty times he doesn't hear you. Daft-eyes; he's as mad as mad can be."This repetition of the word mad conveyed meaning to Bonaparte's mind. Heleft off paddling his toes in the water."Mad, mad? I know that kind of mad," said Bonaparte, "and I know thething to give for it. The front end of a little horsewhip, the tip! Nicething; takes it out," said Bonaparte.The Hottentot laughed, and translated."No more walking about and talking to themselves on this farm now," saidBonaparte; "no more minding of sheep and reading of books at the sametime. The point of a horsewhip is a little thing, but I think he'llhave a taste of it before long." Bonaparte rubbed his hands and lookedpleasantly across his nose; and then the three laughed together grimly.And Waldo in his cabin crouched in the dark in a corner, with his kneesdrawn up to his chin.Chapter 1.X. He Shows His Teeth.Doss sat among the karoo bushes, one yellow ear drawn over his wickedlittle eye, ready to flap away any adventurous fly that might settle onhis nose. Around him in the morning sunlight fed the sheep; behind himlay his master polishing his machine. He found much comfort in handlingit that morning. A dozen philosophical essays, or angelically atunedsongs for the consolation of the bereaved, could never have been to himwhat that little sheep-shearing machine was that day.After struggling to see the unseeable, growing drunk with the endeavourto span the infinite, and writhing before the inscrutable mystery, itis a renovating relief to turn to some simple, feelable, weighablesubstance; to something which has a smell and a colour, which may behandled and turned over this way and that. Whether there be or be nota hereafter, whether there be any use in calling aloud to the Unseenpower, whether there be an Unseen power to call to, whatever be the truenature of the "I" who call and of the objects around me, whatever beour meaning, our internal essence, our cause (and in a certain order ofminds death and the agony of loss inevitably awaken the wild desire,at other times smothered, to look into these things), whatever be thenature of that which lies beyond the unbroken wall which the limits ofthe human intellect build up on every hand, this thing is certain--aknife will cut wood, and one cogged wheel will turn another. This issure.Waldo found an immeasurable satisfaction in the handling of his machine;but Doss winked and blinked, and thought it all frightfully monotonousout there on the flat, and presently dropped asleep, sitting boltupright. Suddenly his eyes opened wide; something was coming from thedirection of the homestead. Winking his eyes and looking intently, heperceived it was the grey mare. Now Doss had wondered much of late whathad become of her master. Seeing she carried some one on her back, henow came to his own conclusion, and began to move his tail violently upand down. Presently he pricked up one ear and let the other hang; histail became motionless, and the expression of his mouth was one ofdecided disapproval bordering on scorn. He wrinkled his lips up on eachside into little lines.The sand was soft, and the grey mare came on so noiselessly that the boyheard nothing till Bonaparte dismounted. Then Doss got up and moved backa step. He did not approve of Bonaparte's appearance. His costume,in truth, was of a unique kind. It was a combination of the town andcountry. The tails of his black cloth coat were pinned up behind to keepthem from rubbing; he had on a pair of moleskin trousers and leathergaiters, and in his hand he carried a little whip of rhinoceros hide.Waldo started and looked up. Had there been a moment's time he wouldhave dug a hole in the sand with his hands and buried his treasure. Itwas only a toy of wood, but he loved it, as one of necessity loves whathas been born of him, whether of the flesh or spirit. When cold eyeshave looked at it, the feathers are rubbed off our butterfly's wingforever."What have you here, my lad?" said Bonaparte, standing by him, andpointing with the end of his whip to the medley of wheels and hinges.The boy muttered something inaudible, and half spread over the thing."But this seems to be a very ingenious little machine," said Bonaparte,seating himself on the antheap, and bending down over it with deepinterest. "What is it for, my lad?""Shearing sheep.""It is a very nice little machine," said Bonaparte. "How does it work,now? I have never seen anything so ingenious!"There was never a parent who heard deception in the voice that praisedhis child--his first-born. Here was one who liked the thing that hadbeen created in him. He forgot everything. He showed how the shearswould work with a little guidance, how the sheep would be held, and thewool fall into the trough. A flush burst over his face as he spoke."I tell you what, my lad," said Bonaparte emphatically, when theexplanation was finished, "we must get you a patent. Your fortune ismade. In three years' time there'll not be a farm in this colony whereit isn't working. You're a genius, that's what you are!" said Bonaparte,rising."If it were made larger," said the boy, raising his eyes, "it would workmore smoothly. Do you think there would be any one in this colony wouldbe able to make it?""I'm sure they could," said Bonaparte; "and if not, why I'll do my bestfor you. I'll send it to England. It must be done somehow. How long haveyou worked at it?""Nine months," said the boy."Oh, it is such a nice little machine," said Bonaparte, "one can't helpfeeling an interest in it. There is only one little improvement, onevery little improvement, I should like to make."Bonaparte put his foot on the machine and crushed it into the sand. Theboy looked up into his face."Looks better now," said Bonaparte, "doesn't it? If we can't have itmade in England we'll send it to America. Good-bye; ta-ta," he added."You're a great genius, a born genius, my dear boy, there's no doubtabout it."He mounted the grey mare and rode off. The dog watched his retreat withcynical satisfaction; but his master lay on the ground with his head onhis arms in the sand, and the little wheels and chips of wood lay onthe ground around him. The dog jumped on to his back and snapped at theblack curls, till, finding that no notice was taken, he walked off toplay with a black beetle. The beetle was hard at work trying to rollhome a great ball of dung it had been collecting all the morning: butDoss broke the ball, and ate the beetle's hind legs, and then bit offits head. And it was all play, and no one could tell what it had livedand worked for. A striving, and a striving, and an ending in nothing.Chapter 1.XI. He Snaps."I have found something in the loft," said Em to Waldo, who waslistlessly piling cakes of fuel on the kraal wall, a week after. "It isa box of books that belonged to my father. We thought Tant Sannie hadburnt them."The boy put down the cake he was raising and looked at her."I don't think they are very nice, not stories," she added, "but you cango and take any you like."So saying, she took up the plate in which she had brought his breakfast,and walked off to the house.After that the boy worked quickly. The pile of fuel Bonaparte hadordered him to pack was on the wall in half an hour. He then went tothrow salt on the skins laid out to dry. Finding the pot empty, he wentto the loft to refill it.Bonaparte Blenkins, whose door opened at the foot of the ladder, saw theboy go up, and stood in the doorway waiting for his return. He wantedhis boots blacked. Doss, finding he could not follow his master up theround bars, sat patiently at the foot of the ladder. Presently he lookedup longingly, but no one appeared. Then Bonaparte looked up also, andbegan to call; but there was no answer. What could the boy be doing? Theloft was an unknown land to Bonaparte. He had often wondered what wasup there; he liked to know what was in all locked-up places andout-of-the-way corners, but he was afraid to climb the ladder. SoBonaparte looked up, and in the name of all that was tantalizing,questioned what the boy did up there. The loft was used only as alumber-room. What could the fellow find up there to keep him so long?Could the Boer-woman have beheld Waldo at that instant, any lingeringdoubt which might have remained in her mind as to the boy's insanitywould instantly have vanished. For, having filled the salt-pot, heproceeded to look for the box of books among the rubbish that filled theloft. Under a pile of sacks he found it--a rough packing-case, nailedup, but with one loose plank. He lifted that, and saw the even backs ofa row of books. He knelt down before the box, and ran his hand along itsrough edges, as if to assure himself of its existence. He stuck his handin among the books, and pulled out two. He felt them, thrust his fingersin among the leaves, and crumpled them a little, as a lover feels thehair of his mistress. The fellow gloated over his treasure. He had hada dozen books in the course of his life; now here was a mine of themopened at his feet. After a while he began to read the titles, and nowand again opened a book and read a sentence; but he was too excited tocatch the meanings distinctly. At last he came to a dull, brown volume.He read the name, opened it in the centre, and where he opened beganto read. It was a chapter on property that he fell upon--Communism,Fourierism, St. Simonism, in a work on Political Economy. He read downone page and turned over to the next; he read down that without changinghis posture by an inch; he read the next, and the next, kneeling up allthe while with the book in his hand, and his lips parted.All he read he did not fully understand; the thoughts were new to him;but this was the fellow's startled joy in the book--the thoughts werehis, they belonged to him. He had never thought them before, but theywere his.He laughed silently and internally, with the still intensity oftriumphant joy.So, then, all thinking creatures did not send up the one cry--"As thou,dear Lord, has created things in the beginning, so are they now, soought they to be, so will they be, world without end; and it doesn'tconcern us what they are. Amen." There were men to whom not only kopjesand stones were calling out imperatively, "What are we, and how camewe here? Understand us, and know us;" but to whom even the old, oldrelations between man and man, and the customs of the ages called, andcould not be made still and forgotten.The boy's heavy body quivered with excitement. So he was not alone, notalone. He could not quite have told any one why he was so glad, andthis warmth had come to him. His cheeks were burning. No wonder thatBonaparte called in vain, and Doss put his paws on the ladder, andwhined till three-quarters of an hour had passed. At last the boy putthe book in his breast and buttoned it tightly to him. He took up thesalt pot, and went to the top of the ladder. Bonaparte, with his handsfolded under his coat-tails, looked up when he appeared, and accostedhim."You've been rather a long time up there, my lad," he said, as theboy descended with a tremulous haste, most unlike his ordinary slowmovements. "You didn't hear me calling, I suppose?"Bonaparte whisked the tails of his coat up and down as he looked at him.He, Bonaparte Blenkins, had eyes which were very far-seeing. He lookedat the pot. It was rather a small pot to have taken three-quarters ofan hour in the filling. He looked at the face. It was flushed. And yet,Tant Sannie kept no wine--he had not been drinking; his eyes werewide open and bright--he had not been sleeping; there was no girl upthere--he had not been making love. Bonaparte looked at him sagaciously.What would account for the marvellous change in the boy coming down theladder from the boy going up the ladder? One thing there was. Did notTant Sannie keep in the loft bultongs, and nice smoked sausages? Theremust be something nice to eat up there! Aha! that was it!Bonaparte was so interested in carrying out this chain of inductivereasoning that he quite forgot to have his boots blacked.He watched the boy shuffle off with the salt-pot under his arm; thenhe stood in his doorway and raised his eyes to the quiet blue sky, andaudibly propounded this riddle to himself:"What is the connection between the naked back of a certain boy with agreatcoat on and a salt-pot under his arm, and the tip of a horsewhip?Answer: No connection at present, but there will be soon."Bonaparte was so pleased with this sally of his wit that he chuckled alittle and went to lie down on his bed.There was bread-baking that afternoon, and there was a fire lightedin the brick oven behind the house, and Tant Sannie had left the greatwooden-elbowed chair in which she passed her life, and waddled out tolook at it. Not far off was Waldo, who, having thrown a pail of foodinto the pigsty, now leaned over the sod wall looking at the pigs. Halfof the sty was dry, but the lower half was a pool of mud, on the edge ofwhich the mother sow lay with closed eyes, her ten little ones sucking;the father pig, knee-deep in the mud, stood running his snout into arotten pumpkin and wriggling his curled tail.Waldo wondered dreamily as he stared why they were pleasant to look at.Taken singly they were not beautiful; taken together they were. Wasit not because there was a certain harmony about them? The old sow wassuited to the little pigs, and the little pigs to their mother, theold boar to the rotten pumpkin, and all to the mud. They suggested thethought of nothing that should be added, of nothing that should betaken away. And, he wondered on vaguely, was not that the secret of allbeauty, that you who look on-- So he stood dreaming, and leaned furtherand further over the sod wall, and looked at the pigs.All this time Bonaparte Blenkins was sloping down from the house in anaimless sort of way; but he kept one eye fixed on the pigsty, and eachgyration brought him nearer to it. Waldo stood like a thing asleep whenBonaparte came close up to him.In old days, when a small boy, playing in an Irish street-gutter, he,Bonaparte, had been familiarly known among his comrades under the titleof Tripping Ben; this, from the rare ease and dexterity with which,by merely projecting his foot, he could precipitate any unfortunatecompanion on to the crown of his head. Years had elapsed, and TrippingBen had become Bonaparte; but the old gift was in him still. He cameclose to the pigsty. All the defunct memories of his boyhood returned onhim in a flood, as, with an adroit movement, he inserted his leg betweenWaldo and the wall and sent him over into the pigsty.The little pigs were startled at the strange intruder, and ran behindtheir mother, who sniffed at him. Tant Sannie smote her hands togetherand laughed; but Bonaparte was far from joining her. Lost in reverie, hegazed at the distant horizon.The sudden reversal of head and feet had thrown out the volume thatWaldo carried in his breast. Bonaparte picked it up and began to inspectit, as the boy climbed slowly over the wall. He would have walked offsullenly, but he wanted his book, and he waited until it should be givenhim."Ha!" said Bonaparte, raising his eyes from the leaves of the book whichhe was examining, "I hope your coat has not been injured; it is of anelegant cut. An heirloom, I presume, from your paternal grandfather? Itlooks nice now.""Oh, Lord! oh! Lord!" cried Tant Sannie, laughing and holding her sides;"how the child looks--as though he thought the mud would never wash off.Oh, Lord, I shall die! You, Bonaparte, are the funniest man I ever saw."Bonaparte Blenkins was now carefully inspecting the volume he had pickedup. Among the subjects on which the darkness of his understanding hadbeen enlightened during his youth, Political Economy had not been one.He was not, therefore, very clear as to what the nature of the bookmight be; and as the name of the writer, J.S. Mill, might, for anythinghe knew to the contrary, have belonged to a venerable member of theBritish and Foreign Bible Society, it by no means threw light upon thequestion. He was not in any way sure that Political Economy had nothingto do with the cheapest way of procuring clothing for the army and navy,which would be certainly both a political and economical subject.But Bonaparte soon came to a conclusion as to the nature of the bookand its contents, by the application of a simple rule now largelyacted upon, but which, becoming universal, would save much thought andvaluable time. It is of marvellous simplicity, of infinite utility, ofuniversal applicability. It may easily be committed to memory and runsthus:Whenever you come into contact with any book, person, or opinion ofwhich you absolutely comprehend nothing, declare that book, person oropinion to be immoral. Bespatter it, vituperate against it, stronglyinsist that any man or woman harbouring it is a fool or a knave, orboth. Carefully abstain from studying it. Do all that in you lies toannihilate that book, person, or opinion.Acting on this rule, so wide in its comprehensiveness, so beautifullysimple in its working, Bonaparte approached Tant Sannie with the book inhis hand. Waldo came a step nearer, eyeing it like a dog whose young hasfallen into evil hands."This book," said Bonaparte, "is not a fit and proper study for a youngand immature mind."Tant Sannie did not understand a word, and said:"What?""This book," said Bonaparte, bringing down his finger with energy on thecover, "this book is sleg, sleg, Davel, Davel!"Tant Sannie perceived from the gravity of his countenance that it was nolaughing matter. From the words "sleg" and "Davel" she understood thatthe book was evil, and had some connection with the prince who pulls thewires of evil over the whole earth."Where did you get this book?" she asked, turning her twinkling littleeyes on Waldo. "I wish that my legs may be as thin as an Englishman's ifit isn't one of your father's. He had more sins than all the Kaffers inKafferland, for all that he pretended to be so good all those years, andto live without a wife because he was thinking of the one that was dead!As though ten dead wives could make up for one fat one with arms andlegs!" cried Tant Sannie, snorting."It was not my father's book," said the boy savagely. "I got it fromyour loft.""My loft! my book! How dare you?" cried Tant Sannie."It was Em's father's. She gave it me," he muttered more sullenly."Give it here. What is the name of it? What is it about?" she asked,putting her finger upon the title.Bonaparte understood."Political Economy," he said slowly."Dear Lord!" said Tant Sannie, "cannot one hear from the very soundwhat an ungodly book it is! One can hardly say the name. Haven't we gotcurses enough on this farm?" cried Tant Sannie, eloquently; "my bestimported Merino ram dying of nobody knows what, and the short-horn cowcasting her two calves, and the sheep eaten up with the scab and thedrought? And is this a time to bring ungodly things about the place, tocall down the vengeance of Almighty God to punish us more? Didn't theminister tell me when I was confirmed not to read any book except myBible and hymn-book, that the devil was in all the rest? And I neverhave read any other book," said Tant Sannie with virtuous energy, "and Inever will!"Waldo saw that the fate of his book was sealed, and turned sullenly onhis heel."So you will not stay to hear what I say!" cried Tant Sannie. "There,take your Polity-gollity-gominy, your devil's book!" she cried, flingingthe book at his head with much energy.It merely touched his forehead on one side and fell to the ground."Go on," she cried; "I know you are going to talk to yourself. Peoplewho talk to themselves always talk to the devil. Go and tell him allabout it. Go, go! run!" cried Tant Sannie.But the boy neither quickened nor slackened his pace, and passedsullenly round the back of the wagon-house.Books have been thrown at other heads before and since that summerafternoon, by hands more white and delicate than those of theBoer-woman; but whether the result of the process has been in any casewholly satisfactory, may be questioned. We love that with a peculiartenderness, we treasure it with a peculiar care, it has for us quitea fictitious value, for which we have suffered. If we may not carry itanywhere else we will carry it in our hearts, and always to the end.Bonaparte Blenkins went to pick up the volume, now loosened from itscover, while Tant Sannie pushed the stumps of wood further into theoven. Bonaparte came close to her, tapped the book knowingly, nodded,and looked at the fire. Tant Sannie comprehended, and, taking the volumefrom his hand, threw it into the back of the oven. It lay upon the heapof coals, smoked, flared, and blazed, and the "Political Economy" was nomore--gone out of existence, like many another poor heretic of flesh andblood.Bonaparte grinned, and to watch the process brought his face so nearthe oven door that the white hair on his eyebrows got singed. He theninquired if there were any more in the loft.Learning that there were, he made signs indicative of taking up armfulsand flinging them into the fire. But Tant Sannie was dubious. Thedeceased Englishman had left all his personal effects specially to hischild. It was all very well for Bonaparte to talk of burning the books.He had had his hair spiritually pulled, and she had no wish to repeathis experience.She shook her head. Bonaparte was displeased. But then a happy thoughtoccurred to him. He suggested that the key of the loft should henceforthbe put into his own safe care and keeping--no one gaining possession ofit without his permission. To this Tant Sannie readily assented, and thetwo walked lovingly to the house to look for it.Chapter 1.XII. He Bites.Bonaparte Blenkins was riding home on the grey mare. He had ridden outthat afternoon, partly for the benefit of his health, partly tomaintain his character as overseer of the farm. As he rode on slowly, hethoughtfully touched the ears of the grey mare with his whip."No, Bon, my boy," he addressed himself, "don't propose! You can't marryfor four years, on account of the will; then why propose? Wheedle her,tweedle her, teedle her, but don't let her make sure of you. When awoman," said Bonaparte, sagely resting his finger against the side ofhis nose, "When a woman is sure of you she does what she likes withyou; but when she isn't, you do what you like with her. And I--" saidBonaparte.Here he drew the horse up suddenly and looked. He was now close to thehouse, and leaning over the pigsty wall, in company with Em, who wasshowing her the pigs, was a strange female figure. It was the firstvisitor that had appeared on the farm since his arrival, and he lookedat her with interest. She was a tall, pudgy girl of fifteen, weighinga hundred and fifty pounds, with baggy pendulous cheeks and up-turnednose. She strikingly resembled Tant Sannie, in form and feature, buther sleepy good eyes lacked that twinkle that dwelt in the Boer-woman'ssmall orbs. She was attired in a bright green print, wore brass rings inher ears and glass beads round her neck, and was sucking the tip of herlarge finger as she looked at the pigs."Who is it that has come?" asked Bonaparte, when he stood drinking hiscoffee in the front room."Why, my niece, to be sure," said Tant Sannie, the Hottentot maidtranslating. "She's the only daughter of my only brother Paul, and she'scome to visit me. She'll be a nice mouthful to the man that can gether," added Tant Sannie. "Her father's got two thousand pounds in thegreen wagon box under his bed, and a farm, and five thousand sheep,and God Almighty knows how many goats and horses. They milk ten cows inmid-winter, and the young men are after her like flies about a bowl ofmilk. She says she means to get married in four months, but she doesn'tyet know to whom. It was so with me when I was young," said Tant Sannie."I've sat up with the young men four and five nights a week. And theywill come riding again, as soon as ever they know that the time's upthat the Englishman made me agree not to marry in."The Boer-woman smirked complacently."Where are you going to?" asked Tant Sannie presently, seeing thatBonaparte rose."Ha! I'm just going to the kraals; I'll be in to supper," saidBonaparte.Nevertheless, when he reached his own door he stopped and turned inthere. Soon after he stood before the little glass, arrayed in his bestwhite shirt with the little tucks, and shaving himself. He had on hisvery best trousers, and had heavily oiled the little fringe at theback of his head, which, however, refused to become darker. But whatdistressed him most was his nose--it was very red. He rubbed his fingerand thumb on the wall, and put a little whitewash on it; but, findingit rather made matters worse, he rubbed it off again. Then he lookedcarefully into his own eyes. They certainly were a little pulled down atthe outer corners, which gave them the appearance of looking crosswise;but then they were a nice blue. So he put on his best coat, took up hisstick, and went out to supper, feeling on the whole well satisfied."Aunt," said Trana to Tant Sannie when that night they lay together inthe great wooden bed, "why does the Englishman sigh so when he looks atme?""Ha!" said Tant Sannie, who was half asleep, but suddenly started, wideawake. "It's because he thinks you look like me. I tell you, Trana,"said Tant Sannie, "the man is mad with love of me. I told him the othernight I couldn't marry till Em was sixteen, or I'd lose all the sheepher father left me. And he talked about Jacob working seven years andseven years again for his wife. And of course he meant me," said TantSannie pompously. "But he won't get me so easily as he thinks; he'llhave to ask more than once.""Oh!" said Trana, who was a lumpish girl and not much given to talking;but presently she added, "Aunt, why does the Englishman always knockagainst a person when he passes them?""That's because you are always in the way," said Tant Sannie."But, aunt," said Trana, presently, "I think he is very ugly.""Phugh!" said Tant Sannie. "It's only because we're not accustomed tosuch noses in this country. In his country he says all the people havesuch noses, and the redder your nose is the higher you are. He's of thefamily of the Queen Victoria, you know," said Tant Sannie, wakening upwith her subject; "and he doesn't think anything of governors and churchelders and such people; they are nothing to him. When his aunt withthe dropsy dies he'll have money enough to buy all the farms in thisdistrict.""Oh!" said Trana. That certainly made a difference."Yes," said Tant Sannie; "and he's only forty-one, though you'd take himto be sixty. And he told me last night the real reason of his baldness."Tant Sannie then proceeded to relate how, at eighteen years of age,Bonaparte had courted a fair young lady. How a deadly rival, jealousof his verdant locks, his golden flowing hair, had, with a damnableand insinuating deception, made him a present of a pot of pomatum. How,applying it in the evening, on rising in the morning he found his pillowstrewn with the golden locks, and, looking into the glass, beheldthe shining and smooth expanse which henceforth he must bear. The fewremaining hairs were turned to a silvery whiteness, and the young ladymarried his rival."And," said Tant Sannie solemnly, "if it had not been for the grace ofGod, and reading of the psalms, he says he would have killed himself. Hesays he could kill himself quite easily if he wants to marry a woman andshe won't.""Alle wereld!" said Trana: and then they went to sleep.Every one was lost in sleep soon; but from the window of the cabin thelight streamed forth. It came from a dung fire, over which Waldo satbrooding. Hour after hour he sat there, now and again throwing a freshlump of fuel on to the fire, which burnt up bravely, and then sank intoa great bed of red coals, which reflected themselves in the boy's eyesas he sat there brooding, brooding, brooding. At last, when the fire wasblazing at its brightest, he rose suddenly and walked slowly to a beamfrom which an ox riem hung. Loosening it, he ran a noose in one end andthen doubled it round his arm."Mine, mine! I have a right," he muttered; and then something louder,"if I fall and am killed, so much the better!"He opened the door and went out into the starlight.He walked with his eyes bent upon the ground, but overhead it was one ofthose brilliant southern nights when every space so small that your handmight cover it shows fifty cold white points, and the Milky-Way is abelt of sharp frosted silver. He passed the door where Bonaparte laydreaming of Trana and her wealth, and he mounted the ladder steps. Fromthose he clambered with some difficulty on to the roof of the house. Itwas of old rotten thatch with a ridge of white plaster, and it crumbledaway under his feet at every step. He trod as heavily as he could. Somuch the better if he fell.He knelt down when he got to the far gable, and began to fasten his riemto the crumbling bricks. Below was the little window of the loft. Withone end of the riem tied round the gable, the other end round his waist,how easy to slide down to it, and to open it, through one of the brokenpanes, and to go in, and to fill his arms with books, and to clamber upagain! They had burnt one book--he would have twenty. Every man's handwas against his--his should be against every man's. No one would helphim--he would help himself.He lifted the black damp hair from his knit forehead, and looked roundto cool his hot face. Then he saw what a regal night it was. He kneltsilently and looked up. A thousand eyes were looking down at him, brightand so cold. There was a laughing irony in them."So hot, so bitter, so angry? Poor little mortal?"He was ashamed. He folded his arms, and sat on the ridge of the rooflooking up at them."So hot, so bitter, so angry?"It was as though a cold hand had been laid upon his throbbing forehead,and slowly they began to fade and grow dim. Tant Sannie and the burntbook, Bonaparte and the broken machine, the box in the loft, he himselfsitting there--how small they all became! Even the grave over yonder.Those stars that shone on up above so quietly, they had seen a thousandsuch little existences fight just so fiercely, flare up just so brightlyand go out; and they, the old, old stars, shone on forever."So hot, so angry, poor little soul?" they said.The riem slipped from his fingers; he sat with his arms folded, lookingup."We," said the stars, "have seen the earth when it was young. We haveseen small things creep out upon its surface--small things that prayedand loved and cried very loudly, and then crept under it again. But we,"said the stars, "are as old as the Unknown."He leaned his chin against the palm of his hand and looked up at them.So long he sat there that bright stars set and new ones rose, and yet hesat on.Then at last he stood up, and began to loosen the riem from the gable.What did it matter about the books? The lust and the desire for them haddied out. If they pleased to keep them from him they might. What matter?it was a very little thing. Why hate, and struggle, and fight? Let it beas it would.He twisted the riem round his arm and walked back along the ridge of thehouse.By this time Bonaparte Blenkins had finished his dream of Trana, and ashe turned himself round for a fresh doze he heard the steps descendingthe ladder. His first impulse was to draw the blanket over his head andhis legs under him, and to shout; but recollecting that the door waslocked and the window carefully bolted, he allowed his head slowly tocrop out among the blankets, and listened intently. Whosoever it mightbe, there was no danger of their getting at him; so he clambered out ofbed, and going on tiptoe to the door, applied his eye to the keyhole.There was nothing to be seen; so walking to the window, he brought hisface as close to the glass as his nose would allow. There was a figurejust discernible. The lad was not trying to walk softly, and the heavyshuffling of the well-known velschoens could be clearly heard throughthe closed window as they crossed the stones in the yard. Bonapartelistened till they had died away round the corner of the wagon-house;and, feeling that his bare legs were getting cold, he jumped back intobed again.*****"What do you keep up in your loft?" inquired Bonaparte of the Boer-womanthe next evening, pointing upwards and elucidating his meaning by theaddition of such Dutch words as he knew, for the lean Hottentot was gonehome."Dried skins," said the Boer-woman, "and empty bottles, and boxes, andsacks, and soap.""You don't keep any of your provisions there--sugar, now?" saidBonaparte, pointing to the sugar-basin and then up at the loft.Tant Sannie shook her head."Only salt, and dried peaches.""Dried peaches! Eh?" said Bonaparte. "Shut the door, my dear child, shutit tight," he called out to Em, who stood in the dining room. Thenhe leaned over the elbow of the sofa and brought his face as close aspossible to the Boer-woman's, and made signs of eating. Then he saidsomething she did not comprehend; then said, "Waldo, Waldo, Waldo,"pointed up to the loft, and made signs of eating again.Now an inkling of his meaning dawned on the Boer-woman's mind. To makeit clearer, he moved his legs after the manner of one going up a ladder,appeared to be opening a door, masticated vigorously, said, "Peaches,peaches, peaches," and appeared to be coming down the ladder.It was now evident to Tant Sannie that Waldo had been in her loft andeaten her peaches.To exemplify his own share in the proceedings, Bonaparte lay down on thesofa, and shutting his eyes tightly, said, "Night, night, night!" Thenhe sat up wildly, appearing to be intently listening, mimicked with hisfeet the coming down a ladder, and looked at Tant Sannie. This clearlyshowed how, roused in the night, he had discovered the theft."He must have been a great fool to eat my peaches," said Tant Sannie."They are full of mites as a sheepskin, and as hard as stones."Bonaparte, fumbling in his pocket, did not even hear her remark, andtook out from his coat-tail a little horsewhip, nicely rolled up.Bonaparte winked at the little rhinoceros horsewhip, at the Boer-woman,and then at the door."Shall we call him--Waldo, Waldo?" he said.Tant Sannie nodded, and giggled. There was something so exceedinglyhumorous in the idea that he was going to beat the boy, though for herown part she did not see that the peaches were worth it. When the Kaffermaid came with the wash-tub she was sent to summon Waldo; and Bonapartedoubled up the little whip and put it in his pocket. Then he drewhimself up, and prepared to act his important part with becominggravity. Soon Waldo stood in the door, and took off his hat."Come in, come in, my lad," said Bonaparte, "and shut the door behind."The boy came in and stood before them."You need not be so afraid, child," said Tant Sannie. "I was a childmyself once. It's no great harm if you have taken a few."Bonaparte perceived that her remark was not in keeping with the natureof the proceedings, and of the little drama he intended to act. Pursingout his lips, and waving his hand, he solemnly addressed the boy."Waldo, it grieves me beyond expression to have to summon you for sopainful a purpose; but it is at the imperative call of duty, which Idare not evade. I do not state that frank and unreserved confession willobviate the necessity of chastisement, which if requisite shall be fullyadministered; but the nature of that chastisement may be mitigatedby free and humble confession. Waldo, answer me as you would your ownfather, in whose place I now stand to you; have you, or have you not,did you, or did you not, eat of the peaches in the loft?""Say you took them, boy, say you took them, then he won't beat youmuch," said the Dutchwoman, good-naturedly, getting a little sorry forhim.The boy raised his eyes slowly and fixed them vacantly upon her, thensuddenly his face grew dark with blood."So, you haven't got anything to say to us, my lad?" said Bonaparte,momentarily forgetting his dignity, and bending forward with a littlesnarl. "But what I mean is just this, my lad--when it takes a boythree-quarters of an hour to fill a salt-pot, and when at three o'clockin the morning he goes knocking about the doors of a loft, it's naturalto suppose there's mischief in it. It's certain there is mischief in it;and where there's mischief in, it must be taken out," said Bonaparte,grinning into the boy's face. Then, feeling that he had fallen from thathigh gravity which was as spice to the pudding, and the flavour of thewhole little tragedy, he drew himself up. "Waldo," he said, "confess tome instantly, and without reserve, that you ate the peaches."The boy's face was white now. His eyes were on the ground, his handsdoggedly clasped before him."What, do you not intend to answer?"The boy looked up at them once from under his bent eyebrows, and thenlooked down again."The creature looks as if all the devils in hell were in it," cried TantSannie. "Say you took them, boy. Young things will be young things; Iwas older than you when I used to eat bultong in my mother's loft, andget the little niggers whipped for it. Say you took them."But the boy said nothing."I think a little solitary confinement might perhaps be beneficial,"said Bonaparte. "It will enable you, Waldo, to reflect on the enormityof the sin you have committed against our Father in heaven. And you mayalso think of the submission you owe to those who are older and wiserthan you are, and whose duty it is to check and correct you."Saying this, Bonaparte stood up and took down the key of the fuel-house,which hung on a nail against the wall."Walk on, my boy," said Bonaparte, pointing to the door; and as hefollowed him out he drew his mouth expressively on one side, and madethe lash of the little horsewhip stick out of his pocket and shake upand down.Tant Sannie felt half sorry for the lad; but she could not helplaughing, it was always so funny when one was going to have a whipping,and it would do him good. Anyhow, he would forget all about it when theplaces were healed. Had not she been beaten many times and been all thebetter for it?Bonaparte took up a lighted candle that had been left burning on thekitchen table, and told the boy to walk before him. They went to thefuel-house. It was a little stone erection that jutted out from the sideof the wagon-house. It was low and without a window, and the dried dungwas piled in one corner, and the coffee-mill stood in another, fastenedon the top of a short post about three feet high. Bonaparte took thepadlock off the rough door."Walk in, my lad," he said.Waldo obeyed sullenly; one place to him was much the same as another. Hehad no objection to being locked up.Bonaparte followed him in, and closed the door carefully. He put thelight down on the heap of dung in the corner, and quietly introduced hishand under his coat-tails, and drew slowly from his pocket the end of arope, which he concealed behind him."I'm very sorry, exceedingly sorry, Waldo, my lad, that you should haveacted in this manner. It grieves me," said Bonaparte.He moved round toward the boy's back. He hardly liked the look in thefellow's eyes, though he stood there motionless. If he should spring onhim!So he drew the rope out very carefully, and shifted round to the woodenpost. There was a slipknot in one end of the rope, and a sudden movementdrew the boy's hands to his back and passed it round them. It was aninstant's work to drag it twice round the wooden post: then Bonapartewas safe.For a moment the boy struggled to free himself; then he knew that he waspowerless, and stood still."Horses that kick must have their legs tied," said Bonaparte, as hepassed the other end of the rope round the boy's knees. "And now, mydear Waldo," taking the whip out of his pocket, "I am going to beatyou."He paused for a moment. It was perfectly quiet; they could hear eachother's breath."'Chasten thy son while there is hope,'" said Bonaparte, "'and let notthy soul spare for his crying.' Those are God's words. I shall act as afather to you, Waldo. I think we had better have your naked back."He took out his penknife, and slit the shirt down from the shoulder tothe waist."Now," said Bonaparte, "I hope the Lord will bless and sanctify to youwhat I am going to do to you."The first cut ran from the shoulder across the middle of the back; thesecond fell exactly in the same place. A shudder passed through theboy's frame."Nice, eh?" said Bonaparte, peeping round into his face, speaking with alisp, as though to a very little child. "Nith, eh?"But the eyes were black and lustreless, and seemed not to see him. Whenhe had given sixteen Bonaparte paused in his work to wipe a little dropof blood from his whip."Cold, eh? What makes you shiver so? Perhaps you would like to pull upyour shirt? But I've not quite done yet."When he had finished he wiped the whip again, and put it back in hispocket. He cut the rope through with his penknife, and then took up thelight."You don't seem to have found your tongue yet. Forgotten how to cry?"said Bonaparte, patting him on the cheek.The boy looked up at him--not sullenly, not angrily. There was a wild,fitful terror in the eyes. Bonaparte made haste to go out and shut thedoor, and leave him alone in the darkness. He himself was afraid of thatlook.*****It was almost morning. Waldo lay with his face upon the ground at thefoot of the fuel-heap. There was a round hole near the top of the door,where a knot of wood had fallen out, and a stream of grey light came inthrough it.Ah, it was going to end at last. Nothing lasts forever, not even thenight. How was it he had never thought of that before? For in all thatlong dark night he had been very strong, had never been tired, neverfelt pain, had run on and on, up and down, up and down; he had notdared to stand still, and he had not known it would end. He had been sostrong, that when he struck his head with all his force upon the stonewall it did not stun him nor pain him--only made him laugh. That was adreadful night.When he clasped his hands frantically and prayed--"O God, my beautifulGod, my sweet God, once, only once, let me feel you near me tonight!"he could not feel him. He prayed aloud, very loud, and he got no answer;when he listened it was all quite quiet--like when the priests of Baalcried aloud to their god--"Oh, Baal, hear us! Oh, Baal, hear us! ButBaal was gone a-hunting."That was a long wild night, and wild thoughts came and went in it; butthey left their marks behind them forever: for, as years cannot passwithout leaving their traces behind them, neither can nights into whichare forced the thoughts and sufferings of years. And now the dawn wascoming, and at last he was very tired. He shivered and tried to draw theshirt up over his shoulders. They were getting stiff. He had never knownthey were cut in the night. He looked up at the white light that camein through the hole at the top of the door and shuddered. Then he turnedhis face back to the ground and slept again.Some hours later Bonaparte came toward the fuel-house with a lump ofbread in his hand. He opened the door and peered in; then entered,and touched the fellow with his boot. Seeing that he breathed heavily,though he did not rouse, Bonaparte threw the bread down on the ground.He was alive, that was one thing. He bent over him, and carefullyscratched open one of the cuts with the nail of his forefinger,examining with much interest his last night's work. He would have tocount his sheep himself that day; the boy was literally cut up. Helocked the door and went away again."Oh, Lyndall," said Em, entering the dining room, and bathed in tears,that afternoon, "I have been begging Bonaparte to let him out, and hewon't.""The more you beg the more he will not," said Lyndall.She was cutting out aprons on the table."Oh, but it's late, and I think they want to kill him," said Em, weepingbitterly; and finding that no more consolation was to be gained from hercousin, she went off blubbering--"I wonder you can cut out aprons whenWaldo is shut up like that."For ten minutes after she was gone Lyndall worked on quietly; then shefolded up her stuff, rolled it tightly together, and stood before theclosed door of the sitting room with her hands closely clasped. A flushrose to her face: she opened the door quickly, and walked in, went tothe nail on which the key of the fuel-room hung. Bonaparte and TantSannie sat there and saw her."What do you want?" they asked together."This key," she said, holding it up, and looking at them."Do you mean her to have it?" said Tant Sannie in Dutch."Why don't you stop her?" asked Bonaparte in English."Why don't you take it from her?" said Tant Sannie.So they looked at each other, talking, while Lyndall walked to thefuel-house with the key, her underlip bitten in."Waldo," she said, as she helped him to stand up, and twisted his armabout her waist to support him, "we will not be children always; weshall have the power, too, some day." She kissed his naked shoulder withher soft little mouth. It was all the comfort her young soul could givehim.Chapter 1.XIII. He Makes Love."Here," said Tant Sannie to her Hottentot maid, "I have been in thishouse four years, and never been up in the loft. Fatter women than I goup ladders; I will go up today and see what it is like, and put it torights up there. You bring the little ladder and stand at the bottom.""There's one would be sorry if you were to fall," said the Hottentotmaid, leering at Bonaparte's pipe, that lay on the table."Hold your tongue, jade," said her mistress, trying to conceal a pleasedsmile, "and go and fetch the ladder."There was a never-used trap-door at one end of the sitting room: thisthe Hottentot maid pushed open, and setting the ladder against it, theBoer-woman with some danger and difficulty climbed into the loft. Thenthe Hottentot maid took the ladder away, as her husband was mending thewagon-house, and needed it; but the trap-door was left open.For a little while Tant Sannie poked about among the empty bottles andskins, and looked at the bag of peaches that Waldo was supposed to haveliked so; then she sat down near the trap-door beside a barrel of saltmutton. She found that the pieces of meat were much too large, and tookout her clasp-knife to divide them.That was always the way when one left things to servants, she grumbledto herself: but when once she was married to her husband Bonaparte itwould not matter whether a sheep spoiled or no--when once his rich auntwith the dropsy was dead. She smiled as she dived her hand into thepickle-water.At that instant her niece entered the room below, closely followed byBonaparte, with his head on one side, smiling mawkishly. Had Tant Sanniespoken at that moment the life of Bonaparte Blenkins would have run awholly different course; as it was, she remained silent, and neithernoticed the open trap-door above their heads."Sit there, my love," said Bonaparte, motioning Trana into her aunt'selbow-chair, and drawing another close up in front of it, in which heseated himself. "There, put your feet upon the stove too. Your aunt hasgone out somewhere. Long have I waited for this auspicious event!"Trana, who understood not one word of English, sat down in the chair andwondered if this was one of the strange customs of other lands, that anold gentleman may bring his chair up to yours, and sit with his kneestouching you. She had been five days in Bonaparte's company, and fearedthe old man, and disliked his nose."How long have I desired this moment!" said Bonaparte. "But that agedrelative of thine is always casting her unhallowed shadow upon us. Lookinto my eyes, Trana."Bonaparte knew that she comprehended not a syllable; but he understoodthat it is the eye, the tone, the action, and not at all the rationalword, that touches the love-chords. He saw she changed colour."All night," said Bonaparte, "I lie awake; I see naught but thy angeliccountenance. I open my arms to receive thee--where art thou, where? Thouart not there!" said Bonaparte, suiting the action to the words, andspreading out his arms and drawing them to his breast."Oh, please, I don't understand," said Trana, "I want to go away.""Yes, yes," said Bonaparte, leaning back in his chair, to hergreat relief, and pressing his hands on his heart, "since first thyamethystine countenance was impressed here--what have I not suffered,what have I not felt? Oh, the pangs unspoken, burning as an ardent coalin a fiery and uncontaminated bosom!" said Bonaparte, bending forwardagain."Dear Lord!" said Trana to herself, "how foolish I have been! The oldman has a pain in his stomach, and now, as my aunt is out, he has cometo me to help him."She smiled kindly at Bonaparte, and pushing past him, went to thebedroom, quickly returning with a bottle of red drops in her hand."They are very good for benauwdheid; my mother always drinks them," shesaid, holding the bottle out.The face in the trap-door was a fiery red. Like a tiger-cat ready tospring. Tant Sannie crouched, with the shoulder of mutton in her hand.Exactly beneath her stood Bonaparte. She rose and clasped with both armsthe barrel of salt meat."What, rose of the desert, nightingale of the colony, that with thineamorous lay whilest the lonesome night!" cried Bonaparte, seizing thehand that held the vonlicsense. "Nay, struggle not! Fly as a strickenfawn into the arms that would embrace thee, thou--"Here a stream of cold pickle-water, heavy with ribs and shoulders,descending on his head abruptly terminated his speech. Half-blinded,Bonaparte looked up through the drops that hung from his eyelids, andsaw the red face that looked down at him. With one wild cry he fled.As he passed out at the front door a shoulder of mutton, well-directed,struck the black coat in the small of the back."Bring the ladder! bring the ladder! I will go after him!" cried theBoer-woman, as Bonaparte Blenkins wildly fled into the fields.*****Late in the evening of the same day Waldo knelt on the floor of hiscabin. He bathed the foot of his dog which had been pierced by a thorn.The bruises on his own back had had five days to heal in, and, excepta little stiffness in his movements, there was nothing remarkable aboutthe boy.The troubles of the young are soon over; they leave no external mark.If you wound the tree in its youth the bark will quickly cover thegash; but when the tree is very old, peeling the bark off, and lookingcarefully, you will see the scar there still. All that is buried is notdead.Waldo poured the warm milk over the little swollen foot; Doss lay veryquiet, with tears in his eyes. Then there was a tap at the door. In aninstant Doss looked wide awake, and winked the tears out from betweenhis little lids."Come in," said Waldo, intent on his work; and slowly and cautiously thedoor opened."Good evening, Waldo, my boy," said Bonaparte Blenkins in a mild voice,not venturing more than his nose within the door. "How are you thisevening?"Doss growled and showed his little teeth, and tried to rise, but his pawhurt him so he whined."I'm very tired, Waldo, my boy," said Bonaparte plaintively.Doss showed his little white teeth again. His master went on with hiswork without looking round. There are some people at whose hands it isbest not to look. At last he said:"Come in."Bonaparte stepped cautiously a little way into the room, and left thedoor open behind him. He looked at the boy's supper on the table."Waldo, I've had nothing to eat all day--I'm very hungry," he said."Eat!" said Waldo after a moment, bending lower over his dog."You won't go and tell her that I am here, will you, Waldo?" saidBonaparte most uneasily. "You've heard how she used me, Waldo? I've beenbadly treated; you'll know yourself what it is some day when you can'tcarry on a little conversation with a lady without having salt meat andpickle-water thrown at you. Waldo, look at me; do I look as a gentlemanshould?"But the boy neither looked up nor answered, and Bonaparte grew moreuneasy."You wouldn't go and tell her that I am here, would you?" saidBonaparte, whiningly. "There's no knowing what she would do to me. I'vesuch trust in you, Waldo; I've always thought you such a promising lad,though you mayn't have known it, Waldo.""Eat," said the boy, "I shall say nothing."Bonaparte, who knew the truth when another spoke it, closed the door,carefully putting on the button. Then he looked to see that the curtainof the window was closely pulled down, and seated himself at the table.He was soon munching the cold meat and bread. Waldo knelt on the floor,bathing the foot with hands which the dog licked lovingly. Once only heglanced at the table, and turned away quickly."Ah, yes! I don't wonder that you can't look at me, Waldo," saidBonaparte; "my condition would touch any heart. You see, the water wasfatty, and that has made all the sand stick to me; and my hair," saidBonaparte, tenderly touching the little fringe at the back of his head,"is all caked over like a little plank; you wouldn't think it was hairat all," said Bonaparte, plaintively. "I had to creep all along thestone walls for fear she'd see me, and with nothing on my head but ared handkerchief, tied under my chin, Waldo; and to hide in a sloot thewhole day, with not a mouthful of food, Waldo. And she gave me such ablow, just here," said Bonaparte.He had cleared the plate of the last morsel, when Waldo rose and walkedto the door."Oh, Waldo, my dear boy, you are not going to call her," said Bonaparte,rising anxiously."I am going to sleep in the wagon," said the boy, opening the door."Oh, we can both sleep in this bed; there's plenty of room. Do stay, myboy, please."But Waldo stepped out."It was such a little whip, Waldo," said Bonaparte, following himdeprecatingly. "I didn't think it would hurt you so much. It was such alittle whip. I am sure you didn't take the peaches. You aren't going tocall her, Waldo, are you?"But the boy walked off.Bonaparte waited till his figure had passed round the front of thewagon-house, and then slipped out. He hid himself round the corner, butkept peeping out to see who was coming. He felt sure the boy was goneto call Tant Sannie. His teeth chattered with inward cold as he lookedround into the darkness and thought of the snakes that might bite him,and the dreadful things that might attack him, and the dead that mightarise out of their graves if he slept out in the field all night. Butmore than an hour passed and no footstep approached.Then Bonaparte made his way back to the cabin. He buttoned the doorand put the table against it and, giving the dog a kick to silence hiswhining when the foot throbbed, he climbed into bed. He did not put outthe light, for fear of the ghost, but, worn out with the sorrows of theday, was soon asleep himself.About four o'clock Waldo, lying between the seats of the horse-wagon,was awakened by a gentle touch on his head.Sitting up, he espied Bonaparte looking through one of the windows witha lighted candle in his hand."I'm about to depart, my dear boy, before my enemies arise, and I couldnot leave without coming to bid you farewell," said Bonaparte.Waldo looked at him."I shall always think of you with affection" said Bonaparte. "Andthere's that old hat of yours, if you could let me have it for akeepsake--""Take it," said Waldo."I thought you would say so, so I brought it with me," said Bonaparte,putting it on. "The Lord bless you, my dear boy. You haven't a fewshillings--just a trifle you don't need--have you?""Take the two shillings that are in the broken vase.""May the blessing of my God rest upon you, my dear child," saidBonaparte; "may He guide and bless you. Give me your hand."Waldo folded his arms closely, and lay down."Farewell, adieu!" said Bonaparte. "May the blessing of my God and myfather's God rest on you, now and evermore."With these words the head and nose withdrew themselves, and the lightvanished from the window.After a few moments the boy, lying in the wagon, heard stealthyfootsteps as they passed the wagon-house and made their way down theroad. He listened as they grew fainter and fainter, and at last diedaway altogether, and from that night the footstep of Bonaparte Blenkinswas heard no more at the old farm.END Of PART I.PART II.     "And it was all play, and no one could tell what it had     lived and worked for.  A striving, and a striving, and an     ending in nothing."Chapter 2.I. Times and Seasons.Waldo lay on his stomach on the sand. Since he prayed and howled to hisGod in the fuel-house three years had passed.They say that in the world to come time is not measured out by monthsand years. Neither is it here. The soul's life has seasons of its own;periods not found in any calendar, times that years and months will notscan, but which are as deftly and sharply cut off from one another asthe smoothly-arranged years which the earth's motion yields us.To stranger eyes these divisions are not evident; but each, lookingback at the little track his consciousness illuminates, sees it cutinto distinct portions, whose boundaries are the termination of mentalstates.As man differs from man, so differ these souls' years. The most materiallife is not devoid of them; the story of the most spiritual is told inthem. And it may chance that some, looking back, see the past cut outafter this fashion:I.The year of infancy, where from the shadowy background of forgetfulnessstart out pictures of startling clearness, disconnected, but brightlycoloured, and indelibly printed in the mind. Much that follows fades,but the colours of those baby-pictures are permanent.There rises, perhaps, a warm summer's evening; we are seated on thedoorstep; we have yet the taste of the bread and milk in our mouth, andthe red sunset is reflected in our basin.Then there is a dark night, where, waking with a fear that there is somegreat being in the room, we run from our own bed to another, creep closeto some large figure, and are comforted.Then there is remembrance of the pride when, on some one's shoulder,with our arms around their head, we ride to see the little pigs, the newlittle pigs with their curled tails and tiny snouts--where do they comefrom?Remembrance of delight in the feel and smell of the first orange we eversee; of sorrow which makes us put up our lip, and cry hard, when onemorning we run out to try and catch the dewdrops, and they melt and wetour little fingers; of almighty and despairing sorrow when we are lostbehind the kraals, and cannot see the house anywhere.And then one picture starts out more vividly than any.There has been a thunderstorm; the ground, as far as the eye can reach,is covered with white hail; the clouds are gone, and overhead a deepblue sky is showing; far off a great rainbow rests on the white earth.We, standing in a window to look, feel the cool, unspeakably sweet windblowing in on us, and a feeling of longing comes over us--unutterablelonging, we cannot tell for what. We are so small, our head only reachesas high as the first three panes. We look at the white earth, and therainbow, and the blue sky; and oh, we want it, we want--we do not knowwhat. We cry as though our heart was broken. When one lifts our littlebody from the window we cannot tell what ails us. We run away to play.So looks the first year.II.Now the pictures become continuous and connected. Material things stillrule, but the spiritual and intellectual take their places.In the dark night when we are afraid we pray and shut our eyes. We pressour fingers very hard upon the lids, and see dark spots moving round andround, and we know they are heads and wings of angels sent to take careof us, seen dimly in the dark as they move round our bed. It is veryconsoling.In the day we learn our letters, and are troubled because we cannot seewhy k-n-o-w should be know, and p-s-a-l-m psalm. They tell us it is sobecause it is so. We are not satisfied; we hate to learn; we like betterto build little stone houses. We can build them as we please, and knowthe reason for them.Other joys too we have incomparably greater then even the building ofstone houses.We are run through with a shudder of delight when in the red sand wecome on one of those white wax flowers that lie between their two greenleaves flat on the sand. We hardly dare pick them, but we feel compelledto do so; and we smell and smell till the delight becomes almost pain.Afterward we pull the green leaves softly into pieces to see the silkthreads run across.Beyond the kopje grow some pale-green, hairy-leaved bushes. We are sosmall, they meet over our head, and we sit among them, and kiss them,and they love us back; it seems as though they were alive.One day we sit there and look up at the blue sky, and down at our fatlittle knees; and suddenly it strikes us, Who are we? This I, whatis it? We try to look in upon ourselves, and ourself beats back uponourself. Then we get up in great fear and run home as hard as we can. Wecan't tell any one what frightened us. We never quite lose that feelingof self again.III.And then a new time rises. We are seven years old. We can read now--readthe Bible. Best of all we like the story of Elijah in his cave at Horeb,and the still small voice.One day, a notable one, we read on the kopje, and discover the fifthchapter of Matthew, and read it all through. It is a new gold-mine. Thenwe tuck the Bible under our arm and rushed home. They didn't know it waswicked to take your things again if some one took them, wicked to go tolaw, wicked to--! We are quite breathless when we get to the house; wetell them we have discovered a chapter they never heard of; we tell themwhat it says. The old wise people tell us they knew all about it. Ourdiscovery is a mare's-nest to them; but to us it is very real. The tencommandments and the old "Thou shalt" we have heard about long enoughand don't care about it; but this new law sets us on fire.We will deny ourself. Our little wagon that we have made, we give to thelittle Kaffers. We keep quiet when they throw sand at us (feeling, oh,so happy). We conscientiously put the cracked teacup for ourselves atbreakfast, and take the burnt roaster-cake. We save our money, and buythreepence of tobacco for the Hottentot maid who calls us names. Weare exotically virtuous. At night we are profoundly religious; eventhe ticking watch says, "Eternity, eternity! hell, hell, hell!" and thesilence talks of God, and the things that shall be.Occasionally, also, unpleasantly shrewd questions begin to be asked bysome one, we know not who, who sits somewhere behind our shoulder. Weget to know him better afterward.Now we carry the questions to the grown-up people, and they give usanswers. We are more or less satisfied for the time. The grown-up peopleare very wise, and they say it was kind of God to make hell, and veryloving of Him to send men there; and besides, he couldn't help Himself,and they are very wise, we think, so we believe them--more or less.IV.Then a new time comes, of which the leading feature is, that the shrewdquestions are asked louder. We carry them to the grown-up people; theyanswer us, and we are not satisfied.And now between us and the dear old world of the senses the spirit-worldbegins to peep in, and wholly clouds it over. What are the flowers tous? They are fuel waiting for the great burning. We look at the wallsof the farmhouse and the matter-of-fact sheep-kraals, with the merrysunshine playing over all; and do not see it. But we see a great whitethrone, and him that sits on it. Around Him stand a great multitude thatno man can number, harpers harping with their harps, a thousand timesten thousand, and thousands of thousands. How white are their robes,washed in the blood of the Lamb! And the music rises higher, and rendsthe vault of heaven with its unutterable sweetness. And we, as welisten, ever and anon, as it sinks on the sweetest, lowest note, hear agroan of the damned from below. We shudder in the sunlight."The torment," says Jeremy Taylor, whose sermons our father reads aloudin the evening, "comprises as many torments as the body of man hasjoints, sinews, arteries, etc., being caused by that penetrating andreal fire of which this temporal fire is but a painted fire. Whatcomparison will there be between burning for a hundred years' space andto be burning without intermission as long as God is God!"We remember the sermon there in the sunlight. One comes and asks why wesit there nodding so moodily. Ah, they do not see what we see.     "A moment's time, a narrow space,      Divides me from that heavenly place,        Or shuts me up in hell."So says Wesley's hymn, which we sing evening by evening. What mattersunshine and walls, men and sheep?"The things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are notseen are eternal." They are real.The Bible we bear always in our breast; its pages are our food; we learnto repeat it; we weep much, for in sunshine and in shade, in the earlymorning or the late evening, in the field or in the house, the devilwalks with us. He comes to a real person, copper-coloured face, head alittle on one side, forehead knit, asking questions. Believe me, it werebetter to be followed by three deadly diseases than by him. He is neversilenced--without mercy. Though the drops of blood stand out on yourheart he will put his question. Softly he comes up (we are only a weebit child); "Is it good of God to make hell? Was it kind of Him to letno one be forgiven unless Jesus Christ died?"Then he goes off, and leaves us writhing. Presently he comes back."Do you love Him?"--waits a little. "Do you love Him? You will be lostif you don't."We say we try to."But do you?" Then he goes off.It is nothing to him if we go quite mad with fear at our own wickedness.He asks on, the questioning devil; he cares nothing what he says. Welong to tell some one, that they may share our pain. We do not yet knowthat the cup of affliction is made with such a narrow mouth that onlyone lip can drink at a time, and that each man's cup is made to matchhis lip.One day we try to tell some one. Then a grave head is shaken solemnlyat us. We are wicked, very wicked, they say we ought not to have suchthoughts. God is good, very good. We are wicked, very wicked. That isthe comfort we get. Wicked! Oh, Lord! do we not know it? Is it not thesense of our own exceeding wickedness that is drying up our young heart,filling it with sand, making all life a dust-bin for us?Wicked? We know it! Too vile to live, too vile to die, too vile to creepover this, God's earth, and move among His believing men. Hell is theone place for him who hates his master, and there we do not want to go.This is the comfort we get from the old.And once again we try to seek for comfort. This time great eyes look atus wondering, and lovely little lips say:"If it makes you so unhappy to think of these things, why do you notthink of something else, and forget?"Forget! We turn away and shrink into ourself. Forget, and think of otherthings! Oh, God! do they not understand that the material world is buta film, through every pore of which God's awful spirit world is shiningthrough on us? We keep as far from others as we can.One night, a rare clear moonlight night, we kneel in the window; everyone else is asleep, but we kneel reading by the moonlight. It is achapter in the prophets, telling how the chosen people of God shallbe carried on the Gentiles' shoulders. Surely the devil might leaveus alone; there is not much to handle for him there. But presently hecomes."Is it right there should be a chosen people? To Him, who is father toall, should not all be dear?"How can we answer him? We were feeling so good till he came. We put ourhead down on the Bible and blister it with tears. Then we fold our handsover our head and pray, till our teeth grind together. Oh, that fromthat spirit-world, so real and yet so silent, that surrounds us, oneword would come to guide us! We are left alone with this devil; and Goddoes not whisper to us. Suddenly we seize the Bible, turning it roundand round, and say hurriedly:"It will be God's voice speaking to us; His voice as though we heardit."We yearn for a token from the inexorably Silent One.We turn the book, put our finger down on a page, and bend to read by themoonlight. It is God's answer. We tremble."Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas,and took Titus with me also."For an instant our imagination seizes it; we are twisting, twirling,trying to make an allegory. The fourteen years are fourteen months; weare Paul and the devil is Barnabas, Titus is-- Then a sudden loathingcomes to us: we are liars and hypocrites, we are trying to deceiveourselves. What is Paul to us--and Jerusalem? We are Barnabas and Titus?We know not the men. Before we know we seize the book, swing it roundour head, and fling it with all our might to the further end of theroom. We put down our head again and weep.Youth and ignorance; is there anything else that can weep so? It isas though the tears were drops of blood congealed beneath the eyelids;nothing else is like those tears. After a long time we are weak withcrying, and lie silent, and by chance we knock against the wood thatstops the broken pane. It falls. Upon our hot stiff face a sweet breathof wind blows. We raise our head, and with our swollen eyes look out atthe beautiful still world, and the sweet night-wind blows in upon us,holy and gentle, like a loving breath from the lips of God. Over usa deep peace comes, a calm, still joy; the tears now flow readily andsoftly. Oh, the unutterable gladness! At last, at last we have found it!"The peace with God." "The sense of sins forgiven." All doubt vanished,God's voice in the soul, the Holy Spirit filling us! We feel Him! Wefeel Him! Oh, Jesus Christ, through you, through you this joy! We pressour hands upon our breast and look upward with adoring gladness. Softwaves of bliss break through us. "The peace with God." "The senseof sins forgiven." Methodists and revivalists say the words, and themocking world shoots out its lip, and walks by smiling--"Hypocrite."There are more fools and fewer hypocrites than the wise world dreamsof. The hypocrite is rare as icebergs in the tropics; the fool commonas buttercups beside a water-furrow: whether you go this way or that youtread on him; you dare not look at your own reflection in the water butyou see one. There is no cant phrase, rotten with age, but it was thedress of a living body; none but at heart it signifies a real bodily ormental condition which some have passed through.After hours and nights of frenzied fear of the supernatural desire toappease the power above, a fierce quivering excitement in every inchof nerve and blood vessel, there comes a time when nature cannot endurelonger, and the spring long bent recoils. We sink down emasculated. Upcreeps the deadly delicious calm."I have blotted out as a cloud thy sins, and as a thick cloud thytrespasses, and will remember them no more for ever." We weep with softtransporting joy.A few experience this; many imagine they experience it, one here andthere lies about it. In the main, "The peace with God; a sense ofsins forgiven," stands for a certain mental and physical reaction. Itsreality those know who have felt it.And we, on that moonlight night, put down our head on the window, "Oh,God! we are happy, happy; thy child forever. Oh, thank you, God!" and wedrop asleep.Next morning the Bible we kiss. We are God's forever. We go out to work,and it goes happily all day, happily all night; but hardly so happily,not happily at all, the next day; and the next night the devil asks us,"where is your Holy Spirit?"We cannot tell.So month by month, summer and winter, the old life goes on--reading,praying, weeping, praying. They tell us we become utterly stupid. Weknow it. Even the multiplication table we learnt with so much care weforgot. The physical world recedes further and further from us. Truly welove not the world, neither the things that are in it. Across the boundsof sleep our grief follows us. When we wake in the night we are sittingup in bed weeping bitterly, or find ourself outside in the moonlight,dressed, and walking up and down, and wringing our hands, and we cannottell how we came there. So pass two years, as men reckon them.V.Then a new time.Before us there were three courses possible--to go mad, to die, tosleep.We take the latter course; or nature takes it for us.All things take rest in sleep; the beasts, birds, the very flowers closetheir eyes, and the streams are still in winter; all things take rest;then why not the human reason also? So the questioning devil in us dropsasleep, and in that sleep a beautiful dream rises for us. Though youhear all the dreams of men, you will hardly find a prettier one thanours. It ran so:In the centre of all things is a mighty Heart, which, having begottenall things, loves them; and, having born them into life, beats withgreat throbs of love towards them. No death for His dear insects, nohell for His dear men, no burning up for His dear world--His own, ownworld that he has made. In the end all will be beautiful. Do not askus how we make our dream tally with facts; the glory of a dream isthis--that it despises facts, and makes its own. Our dream saves us fromgoing mad; that is enough.Its peculiar point of sweetness lay here. When the Mighty Heart'syearning of love became too great for other expression, it shaped itselfinto the sweet Rose of heaven, the beloved Man-god.Jesus! you Jesus of our dream! how we loved you; no Bible tells of youas we knew you. Your sweet hands held ours fast; your sweet voice saidalways, "I am here, my loved one, not far off; put your arms about me,and hold fast."We find Him in everything in those days. When the little weary lamb wedrive home drags its feet, we seize on it, and carry it with its headagainst our face. His little lamb! We feel we have got Him.When the drunken Kaffer lies by the road in the sun we draw his blanketover his head, and put green branches of milk-bush on it. His Kaffer;why should the sun hurt him?In the evening, when the clouds lift themselves like gates, and the redlights shine through them, we cry; for in such glory He will come, andthe hands that ache to touch Him will hold him, and we shall see thebeautiful hair and eyes of our God. "Lift up your heads, O, ye gates;and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and our King of glory shallcome in!"The purple flowers, the little purple flowers, are His eyes, looking atus. We kiss them, and kneel alone on the flat, rejoicing over them. Andthe wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for Him, and thedesert shall rejoice and blossom as a rose.If ever, in our tearful, joyful ecstasy, the poor, sleepy, half-deaddevil should raise his head, we laugh at him. It is not his hour now."If there should be a hell, after all!" he mutters. "If your God shouldbe cruel! If there should be no God! If you should find out it is allimagination! If--"We laugh at him. When a man sits in the warm sunshine, do you ask himfor proof of it? He feels--that is all. And we feel--that is all. Wewant no proof of our God. We feel, we feel!We do not believe in our God because the Bible tells us of Him. Webelieve in the Bible because He tells us of it. We feel Him, we feelHim, we feel--that is all! And the poor, half-swamped devil mutters:"But if the day should come when you do not feel?"And we laugh and cry him down."It will never come--never," and the poor devil slinks to sleep again,with his tail between his legs. Fierce assertion many times repeated ishard to stand against; only time separates the truth from the lie. So wedream on.One day we go with our father to town, to church. The townspeople rustlein their silks, and the men in their sleek cloth, and settle themselvesin their pews, and the light shines in through the windows on theartificial flowers in the women's bonnets. We have the same miserablefeeling that we have in a shop where all the clerks are very smart. Wewish our father hadn't brought us to town, and we were out on thekaroo. Then the man in the pulpit begins to preach. His text is "He thatbelieveth not shall be damned."The day before the magistrate's clerk, who was an atheist, has died inthe street struck by lightning.The man in the pulpit mentions no name; but he talks of "The hand of Godmade visible amongst us." He tells us how, when the white stroke fell,quivering and naked, the soul fled, robbed of his earthly filament, andlay at the footstool of God; how over its head has been poured out thewrath of the Mighty One, whose existence it has denied; and, quiveringand terrified, it has fled to the everlasting shade.We, as we listen, half start up; every drop of blood in our body hasrushed to our head. He lies! he lies! he lies! That man in the pulpitlies! Will no one stop him? Have none of them heard--do none of themknow, that when the poor, dark soul shut its eyes on earth it openedthem in the still light of heaven? that there is no wrath where God'sface is? that if one could once creep to the footstool of God, there iseverlasting peace there, like the fresh stillness of the early morning?While the atheist lay wondering and afraid, God bent down and said:"My child, here I am--I, whom you have not known; I, whom you have notbelieved in; I am here. I sent My messenger, the white sheet-lightning,to call you home. I am here."Then the poor soul turned to the light--its weakness and pain were goneforever.Have they not known, have they not heard, who it is rules?"For a little moment have I hidden my face from thee; but witheverlasting kindness will I have mercy upon thee, saith the Lord thyRedeemer."We mutter on to ourselves, till some one pulls us violently by the armto remind us we are in church. We see nothing but our own ideas.Presently every one turns to pray. There are six hundred souls liftingthemselves to the Everlasting light.Behind us sit two pretty ladies; one hands her scent-bottle softly tothe other, and a mother pulls down her little girl's frock. One ladydrops her handkerchief; a gentleman picks it up; she blushes. The womenin the choir turn softly the leaves of their tune-books, to be readywhen the praying is done. It is as though they thought more of thesinging than the Everlasting Father. Oh, would it not be more worship ofHim to sit alone in the karoo and kiss one little purple flower that hehad made? Is it not mockery? Then the thought comes, "What doest thouhere, Elijah?" We who judge, what are we better than they?--ratherworse. Is it any excuse to say, "I am but a child and must come?" DoesGod allow any soul to step in between the spirit he made and himself?What do we there in that place, where all the words are lies against theAll Father? Filled with horror, we turn and flee out of the place. Onthe pavement we smite our foot, and swear in our child's soul neveragain to enter those places where men come to sing and pray. We arequestioned afterward. Why was it we went out of the church.How can we explain?--we stand silent. Then we are pressed further, andwe try to tell. Then a head is shaken solemnly at us. No one can thinkit wrong to go to the house of the Lord; it is the idle excuse of awicked boy. When will we think seriously of our souls, and love going tochurch? We are wicked, very wicked. And we--we slink away and go aloneto cry. Will it be always so? Whether we hate and doubt, or whether webelieve and love, to our dearest, are we to seem always wicked?We do not yet know that in the soul's search for truth the bitternesslies here, the striving cannot always hide itself among the thoughts;sooner or later it will clothe itself in outward action; then it stepsin and divides between the soul and what it loves. All things on earthhave their price; and for truth we pay the dearest. We barter it forlove and sympathy. The road to honour is paved with thorns; but on thepath to truth, at every step you set your foot down on your own heart.VI.Then at last a new time--the time of waking; short, sharp, and notpleasant, as wakings often are.Sleep and dreams exist on this condition--that no one wake the dreamer.And now life takes us up between her finger and thumb, shakes usfuriously, till our poor nodding head is well-nigh rolled from ourshoulders, and she sets us down a little hard on the bare earth, bruisedand sore, but preternaturally wide awake.We have said in our days of dreaming, "Injustice and wrong are aseeming; pain is a shadow. Our God, He is real, He who made all things,and He only is Love."Now life takes us by the neck and shows us a few other things,--new-madegraves with the red sand flying about them; eyes that we love with theworms eating them; evil men walking sleek and fat, the whole terriblehurly-burly of the thing called life,--and she says, "What do you thinkof these?" We dare not say "Nothing." We feel them; they are very real.But we try to lay our hands about and feel that other thing we feltbefore. In the dark night in the fuel-room we cry to our Beautifuldream-god: "Oh, let us come near you, and lay our head against yourfeet. Now in our hour of need be near us." But He is not there; He isgone away. The old questioning devil is there.We must have been awakened sooner or later. The imagination cannotalways triumph over reality, the desire over truth. We must have beenawakened. If it was done a little sharply, what matter? It was donethoroughly, and it had to be done.VII.And a new life begins for us--a new time, a life as cold as that ofa man who sits on the pinnacle of an iceberg and sees the glitteringcrystals all about him. The old looks indeed like a long hot delirium,peopled with phantasies. The new is cold enough.Now we have no God. We have had two: the old God that our fathers handeddown to us, that we hated, and never liked: the new one that we made forourselves, that we loved; but now he has flitted away from us, and wesee what he was made of--the shadow of our highest ideal, crowned andthroned. Now we have no God."The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." It may be so. Mostthings said or written have been the work of fools.This thing is certain--he is a fool who says, "No man hath said in hisheart, There is no God."It has been said many thousand times in hearts with profound bitternessof earnest faith.We do not cry and weep: we sit down with cold eyes and look at theworld. We are not miserable. Why should we be? We eat and drink, andsleep all night; but the dead are not colder.And we say it slowly, but without sighing, "Yes, we see it now; there isno God."And, we add, growing a little colder yet. "There is no justice. The oxdies in the yoke, beneath its master's whip; it turns its anguish-filledeyes on the sunlight, but there is no sign of recompense to be made it.The black man is shot like a dog, and it goes well with the shooter.The innocent are accused and the accuser triumphs. If you will take thetrouble to scratch the surface anywhere, you will see under the skin asentient being writhing in impotent anguish."And, we say further, and our heart is as the heart of the dead forcoldness, "There is no order: all things are driven about by a blindchance."What a soul drinks in with its mother's milk will not leave it in aday. From our earliest hour we have been taught that the thought of theheart, the shaping of the rain-cloud, the amount of wool that grows ona sheep's back, the length of a drought, and the growing of the corn,depend on nothing that moves immutable, at the heart of all things;but on the changeable will of a changeable being, whom our prayers canalter. To us, from the beginning, nature has been but a poor plasticthing, to be toyed with this way or that, as man happens to please hisdeity or not; to go to church or not; to say his prayers right or not;to travel on a Sunday or not. Was it possible for us in an instant tosee Nature as she is--the flowing vestment of an unchanging reality?When the soul breaks free from the arms of a superstition, bits of theclaws and talons break themselves off in him. It is not the work of aday to squeeze them out.And so, for us, the human-like driver and guide being gone, allexistence, as we look out at it with our chilled, wondering eyes, is anaimless rise and swell of shifting waters. In all that weltering chaoswe can see no spot so large as a man's hand on which we may plant ourfoot.Whether a man believes in a human-like God or no is a small thing.Whether he looks into the mental and physical world and sees no relationbetween cause and effect, no order, but a blind chance sporting, this isthe mightiest fact that can be recorded in any spiritual existence. Itwere almost a mercy to cut his throat, if indeed he does not do it forhimself.We, however, do not cut our throats. To do so would imply some desireand feeling, and we have no desire and no feeling; we are only cold. Wedo not wish to live, and we do not wish to die. One day a snake curlsitself round the waist of a Kaffer woman. We take it in our hand, swingit round and round, and fling it on the ground--dead. Every one looksat us with eyes of admiration. We almost laugh. Is it wonderful to riskthat for which we care nothing?In truth, nothing matters. This dirty little world full of confusion,and the blue rag, stretched overhead for a sky, is so low we could touchit with our hand.Existence is a great pot, and the old Fate who stirs it round caresnothing what rises to the top and what goes down, and laughs when thebubbles burst. And we do not care. Let it boil about. Why should wetrouble ourselves? Nevertheless the physical sensations are real.Hunger hurts, and thirst, therefore we eat and drink: inaction painsus, therefore we work like galley-slaves. No one demands it, but we setourselves to build a great dam in red sand beyond the graves. In thegrey dawn before the sheep are let out we work at it. All day, while theyoung ostriches we tend feed about us, we work on through the fiercestheat. The people wonder what new spirit has seized us now. They do notknow we are working for life. We bear the greatest stones, and feel asatisfaction when we stagger under them, and are hurt by a pang thatshoots through our chest. While we eat our dinner we carry on basketsfull of earth, as though the devil drove us. The Kaffer servants have astory that at night a witch and two white oxen come to help us. No wall,they say, could grow so quickly under one man's hands.At night, alone in our cabin, we sit no more brooding over the fire.What should we think of now? All is emptiness. So we take the oldarithmetic; and the multiplication table, which with so much pains welearnt long ago and forgot directly, we learn now in a few hours,and never forget again. We take a strange satisfaction in workingarithmetical problems. We pause in our building to cover the stones withfigures and calculations. We save money for a Latin Grammar and Algebra,and carry them about in our pockets, poring over them as over our Bibleof old. We have thought we were utterly stupid, incapable of rememberinganything, of learning anything. Now we find that all is easy. Has a newsoul crept into this old body, that even our intellectual faculties arechanged? We marvel; not perceiving that what a man expends in prayer andecstasy he cannot have over for acquiring knowledge. You never shed atear, or create a beautiful image, or quiver with emotion, but you payfor it at the practical, calculating end of your nature. You have justso much force: when the one channel runs over the other runs dry.And now we turn to Nature. All these years we have lived beside her, andwe have never seen her; and now we open our eyes and look at her.The rocks have been to us a blur of brown: we bend over them, andthe disorganised masses dissolve into a many-coloured, many-shaped,carefully-arranged form of existence. Here masses of rainbow-tintedcrystals, half-fused together; there bands of smooth grey and redmethodically overlying each other. This rock here is covered witha delicate silver tracery, in some mineral, resembling leaves andbranches; there on the flat stone, on which we so often have sat to weepand pray, we look down, and see it covered with the fossil footprints ofgreat birds, and the beautiful skeleton of a fish. We have often triedto picture in our mind what the fossiled remains of creatures mustbe like, and all the while we sat on them, we have been so blinded bythinking and feeling that we have never seen the world.The flat plain has been to us a reach of monotonous red. We look at it,and every handful of sand starts into life. That wonderful people, theants, we learn to know; see them make war and peace, play and work, andbuild their huge palaces. And that smaller people we make acquaintancewith, who live in the flowers. The bitto flower has been for us a mereblur of yellow; we find its heart composed of a hundred perfect flowers,the homes of the tiny black people with red stripes, who move in and outin that little yellow city. Every bluebell has its inhabitant. Every daythe karoo shows us a new wonder sleeping in its teeming bosom.On our way back to work we pause and stand to see the ground-spider makeits trap, bury itself in the sand, and then wait for the falling in ofits enemy.Further on walks a horned beetle, and near him starts open the door ofa spider, who peeps out carefully, and quickly pulls it down again. Ona karoo-bush a green fly is laying her silver eggs. We carry them home,and see the shells pierced, the spotted grub come out, turn to a greenfly, and flit away. We are not satisfied with what Nature shows us, andwe see something for ourselves. Under the white hen we put a dozen eggs,and break one daily, to see the white spot wax into the chicken. We arenot excited or enthusiastic about it; but a man is not to lay his throatopen, he must think of something. So we plant seeds in rows on ourdam-wall, and pull one up daily to see how it goes with them. Alladeenburied her wonderful stone, and a golden palace sprung up at her feet.We do far more. We put a brown seed in the earth, and a living thingstarts out--starts upward--why, no more than Alladeen can we say--startsupward, and does not desist till it is higher than our heads, sparklingwith dew in the early morning, glittering with yellow blossoms, shakingbrown seeds with little embryo souls on to the ground. We look at itsolemnly, from the time it consists of two leaves peeping above theground and a soft white root, till we have to raise our faces to look atit; but we find no reason for that upward starting.We look into dead ducks and lambs. In the evening we carry them home,spread newspapers on the floor, and lie working with them till midnight.With a started feeling near akin to ecstasy we open the lump of fleshcalled a heart, and find little doors and strings inside. We feel them,and put the heart away; but every now and then return to look, and tofeel them again. Why we like them so we can hardly tell.A gander drowns itself in our dam. We take it out, and open it on thebank, and kneel looking at it. Above are the organs divided by delicatetissues; below are the intestines artistically curved in a spiral form,and each tier covered by a delicate network of blood-vessels standingout red against the faint blue background. Each branch of theblood-vessels is comprised of a trunk, bifurcating and rebifurcatinginto the most delicate, hair-like threads, symmetrically arranged. Weare struck with its singular beauty. And, moreover--and here we dropfrom our kneeling into a sitting posture--this also we remark: of thatsame exact shape and outline is our thorn-tree seen against the sky inmid-winter: of that shape also is delicate metallic tracery between ourrocks; in that exact path does our water flow when without a furrow welead it from the dam; so shaped are the antlers of the horned beetle.How are these things related that such deep union should exist betweenthem all? Is it chance? Or, are they not all the fine branches of onetrunk, whose sap flows through us all? That would explain it. We nodover the gander's inside.This thing we call existence; is it not a something which has its rootsfar down below in the dark, and its branches stretching out into theimmensity above, which we among the branches cannot see? Not achance jungle; a living thing, a One. The thought gives us intensesatisfaction, we cannot tell why.We nod over the gander; then start up suddenly, look into the blue sky,throw the dead gander and the refuse into the dam, and go to work again.And so, it comes to pass in time, that the earth ceases for us to be aweltering chaos. We walk in the great hall of life, looking up and roundreverentially. Nothing is despicable--all is meaning-full; nothing issmall--all is part of a whole, whose beginning and end we know not. Thelife that throbs in us is a beginning and end we know not. The life thatthrobs in us is a pulsation from it; too mighty for our comprehension,not too small.And so, it comes to pass at last, that whereas the sky was at first asmall blue rag stretched out over us, and so low that our hands mighttouch it, pressing down on us, it raises itself into an immeasurableblue arch over our heads, and we begin to live again.Chapter 2.II. Waldo's Stranger.Waldo lay on his stomach on the red sand. The small ostriches he herdedwandered about him, pecking at the food he had cut, or at pebbles anddry sticks. On his right lay the graves; to his left the dam; in hishand was a large wooden post covered with carvings, at which he worked.Doss lay before him basking in the winter sunshine, and now and againcasting an expectant glance at the corner of the nearest ostrich camp.The scrubby thorn-trees under which they lay yielded no shade, but nonewas needed in that glorious June weather, when in the hottest part ofthe afternoon the sun was but pleasantly warm; and the boy carved on,not looking up, yet conscious of the brown serene earth about him andthe intensely blue sky above.Presently, at the corner of the camp, Em appeared, bearing a coveredsaucer in one hand and in the other a jug, with a cup in the top. Shewas grown into a premature little old woman of sixteen, ridiculouslyfat. The jug and saucer she put down on the ground before the dog andhis master and dropped down beside them herself, panting and out ofbreath."Waldo, as I came up the camps I met some one on horseback, and I dobelieve it must be the new man that is coming."The new man was an Englishman to whom the Boer-woman had hired half thefarm."Hum!" said Waldo."He is quite young," said Em, holding her side, "and he has brown hair,and beard curling close to his face, and such dark blue eyes. And,Waldo, I was so ashamed! I was just looking back to see, you know, andhe happened just to be looking back too, and we looked right into eachother's faces; and he got red, and I got so red. I believe he is the newman.""Yes," said Waldo."I must go now. Perhaps he has brought us letters from the post fromLyndall. You know she can't stay at school much longer, she must comeback soon. And the new man will have to stay with us till his house isbuilt. I must get his room ready. Good-bye!"She tripped off again, and Waldo carved on at his post. Doss lay withhis nose close to the covered saucer, and smelt that some one had madenice little fat cakes that afternoon. Both were so intent on theiroccupation that not till a horse's hoofs beat beside them in the sanddid they look up to see a rider drawing in his steed.He was certainly not the stranger whom Em had described. A dark,somewhat French-looking little man of eight-and-twenty, rather stout,with heavy, cloudy eyes and pointed moustaches. His horse was a fierycreature, well caparisoned; a highly-finished saddlebag hung from thesaddle; the man's hands were gloved, and he presented the appearance-anappearance rare on that farm--of a well-dressed gentleman.In an uncommonly melodious voice he inquired whether he might be allowedto remain there for an hour. Waldo directed him to the farmhouse, butthe stranger declined. He would merely rest under the trees and give hishorse water. He removed the saddle and Waldo led the animal away to thedam. When he returned, the stranger had settled himself under the trees,with his back against the saddle. The boy offered him of the cakes. Hedeclined, but took a draught from the jug; and Waldo lay down not faroff and fell to work again. It mattered nothing if cold eyes saw it. Itwas not his sheep-shearing machine. With material loves, as with human,we go mad once, love out, and have done. We never get up the trueenthusiasm a second time. This was but a thing he had made, labouredover, loved and liked--nothing more--not his machine.The stranger forced himself lower down in the saddle and yawned. It wasa drowsy afternoon, and he objected to travel in these out-of-the-worldparts. He liked better civilised life, where at every hour of the day aman may look for his glass of wine, and his easy-chair, and paper; whereat night he may lock himself into his room with his books and a bottleof brandy, and taste joys mental and physical. The world said ofhim--the all-knowing, omnipotent world, whom no locks can bar, who hasthe cat-like propensity of seeing best in the dark--the world said,that better than the books he loved the brandy, and better than booksor brandy that which it had been better had he loved less. But for theworld he cared nothing; he smiled blandly in its teeth. All life is adream; if wine and philosophy and women keep the dream from becoming anightmare, so much the better. It is all they are fit for, all they canbe used for. There was another side to his life and thought; but of thatthe world knew nothing, and said nothing, as the way of the wise worldis.The stranger looked from beneath his sleepy eyelids at the brown earththat stretched away, beautiful in spite of itself in that June sunshine;looked at the graves, the gables of the farmhouse showing over the stonewalls of the camps, at the clownish fellow at his feet, and yawned. Buthe had drunk of the hind's tea, and must say something."Your father's place I presume?" he inquired sleepily."No; I am only a servant.""Dutch people?""Yes.""And you like the life?"The boy hesitated."On days like these.""And why on these?"The boy waited."They are very beautiful."The stranger looked at him. It seemed that as the fellow's dark eyeslooked across the brown earth they kindled with an intense satisfaction;then they looked back at the carving.What had that creature, so coarse-clad and clownish, to do with thesubtle joys of the weather? Himself, white-handed and delicate, hemight hear the music with shimmering sunshine and solitude play on thefinely-strung chords of nature; but that fellow! Was not the ear in thatgreat body too gross for such delicate mutterings?Presently he said:"May I see what you work at?"The fellow handed his wooden post. It was by no means lovely. The menand birds were almost grotesque in their laboured resemblance to nature,and bore signs of patient thought. The stranger turned the thing over onhis knee."Where did you learn this work?""I taught myself.""And these zigzag lines represent--""A mountain."The stranger looked."It has some meaning, has it not?"The boy muttered confusedly."Only things."The questioner looked down at him--the huge, unwieldy figure, in sizea man's, in right of his childlike features and curling hair a child's;and it hurt him--it attracted him and it hurt him. It was somethingbetween pity and sympathy."How long have you worked at this?""Nine months."From his pocket the stranger drew his pocket-book, and took somethingfrom it. He could fasten the post to his horse in some way, and throw itaway in the sand when at a safe distance."Will you take this for your carving?"The boy glanced at the five-pound note and shook his head."No; I cannot.""You think it is worth more?" asked the stranger with a little sneer.He pointed with his thumb to a grave."No; it is for him.""And who is there?" asked the stranger."My father."The man silently returned the note to his pocket-book, and gave thecarving to the boy; and, drawing his hat over his eyes, composed himselfto sleep. Not being able to do so, after a while he glanced over thefellow's shoulder to watch him work. The boy carved letters into theback."If," said the stranger, with his melodious voice, rich with a sweetnessthat never showed itself in the clouded eyes--for sweetness will lingeron in the voice long after it has died out in the eyes--"if for such apurpose, why write that upon it?"The boy glanced round at him, but made no answer. He had almostforgotten his presence."You surely believe," said the stranger, "that some day, sooner orlater, these graves will open, and those Boer-uncles with their wiveswalk about here in the red sand, with the very fleshly legs with whichthey went to sleep? Then why say, 'He sleeps forever?' You believe hewill stand up again?""Do you?" asked the boy, lifting for an instant his heavy eyes to thestranger's face.Half taken aback the stranger laughed. It was as though a curious littletadpole which he held under his glass should suddenly lift its tail andbegin to question him."I?--no." He laughed his short thick laugh. "I am a man who believesnothing, hopes nothing, fears nothing, feels nothing. I am beyond thepale of humanity; no criterion of what you should be who live here amongyour ostriches and bushes."The next moment the stranger was surprised by a sudden movement on thepart of the fellow, which brought him close to the stranger's feet. Soonafter he raised his carving and laid it across the man's knee."Yes, I will tell you," he muttered; "I will tell you all about it."He put his finger on the grotesque little mannikin at the bottom (ah!that man who believed nothing, hoped nothing, felt nothing; how he lovedhim!), and with eager finger the fellow moved upward, explaining overfantastic figures and mountains, to the crowning bird from whose wingdropped a feather. At the end he spoke with broken breath--short words,like one who utters things of mighty import.The stranger watched more the face than the carving; and there was nowand then a show of white teeth beneath the moustaches as he listened."I think," he said blandly, when the boy had done, "that I partlyunderstand you. It is something after this fashion, is it not?" (Hesmiled.) "In certain valleys there was a hunter." (He touched thegrotesque little figure at the bottom.) "Day by day he went to hunt forwild-fowl in the woods; and it chanced that once he stood on the shoresof a large lake. While he stood waiting in the rushes for the comingof the birds, a great shadow fell on him, and in the water he saw areflection. He looked up to the sky; but the thing was gone. Then aburning desire came over him to see once again that reflection in thewater, and all day he watched and waited; but night came and it had notreturned. Then he went home with his empty bag, moody and silent. Hiscomrades came questioning about him to know the reason, but he answeredthem nothing; he sat alone and brooded. Then his friend came to him, andto him he spoke."'I have seen today,' he said, 'that which I never saw before--a vastwhite bird, with silver wings outstretched, sailing in the everlastingblue. And now it is as though a great fire burnt within my breast. Itwas but a sheen, a shimmer, a reflection in the water; but now I desirenothing more on earth than to hold her.'"His friend laughed."'It was but a beam playing on the water, or the shadow of your ownhead. Tomorrow you will forget her,' he said."But tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow the hunter walked alone.He sought in the forest and in the woods, by the lakes and among therushes, but he could not find her. He shot no more wild fowl; what werethey to him?"'What ails him?' said his comrades."'He is mad,' said one."'No; but he is worse,' said another; 'he would see that which none ofus have seen, and make himself a wonder.'"'Come, let us forswear his company,' said all."So the hunter walked alone."One night, as he wandered in the shade, very heartsore and weeping, anold man stood before him, grander and taller than the sons of men."'Who are you?' asked the hunter."'I am Wisdom,' answered the old man; 'but some men call me Knowledge.All my life I have grown in these valleys; but no man sees me till hehas sorrowed much. The eyes must be washed with tears that are to beholdme; and, according as a man has suffered, I speak.'"And the hunter cried:"'Oh, you who have lived here so long, tell me, what is that great wildbird I have seen sailing in the blue? They would have me believe she isa dream; the shadow of my own head.'"The old man smiled."'Her name is Truth. He who has once seen her never rests again. Tilldeath he desires her.'"And the hunter cried:"'Oh, tell me where I may find her.'"But the old man said:"'You have not suffered enough,' and went."Then the hunter took from his breast the shuttle of Imagination, andwound on it the thread of his Wishes; and all night he sat and wove anet."In the morning he spread the golden net upon the ground, and into ithe threw a few grains of credulity, which his father had left him, andwhich he kept in his breast-pocket. They were like white puff-balls, andwhen you trod on them a brown dust flew out. Then he sat by to see whatwould happen. The first that came into the net was a snow-whitebird, with dove's eyes, and he sang a beautiful song--'A human-God! ahuman-God! a human-God!' it sang. The second that came was black andmystical, with dark, lovely eyes, that looked into the depths of yoursoul, and he sang only this--'Immortality!'"And the hunter took them both in his arms for he said--"'They are surely of the beautiful family of Truth.'"Then came another, green and gold, who sang in a shrill voice, like onecrying in the marketplace,--'Reward after Death! Reward after Death!'"And he said--"'You are not so fair; but you are fair too,' and he took it."And others came, brightly coloured, singing pleasant songs, tillall the grains were finished. And the hunter gathered all his birdstogether, and built a strong iron cage called a new creed, and put allhis birds in it."Then the people came about dancing and singing."'Oh, happy hunter!' they cried. 'Oh, wonderful man! Oh, delightfulbirds! Oh, lovely songs!'"No one asked where the birds had come from, nor how they had beencaught; but they danced and sang before them. And the hunter too wasglad, for he said:"'Surely Truth is among them. In time she will moult her feathers, and Ishall see her snow-white form.'"But the time passed, and the people sang and danced; but the hunter'sheart grew heavy. He crept alone, as of old, to weep; the terribledesire had awakened again in his breast. One day, as he sat aloneweeping, it chanced that Wisdom met him. He told the old man what he haddone."And Wisdom smiled sadly."'Many men,' he said, 'have spread that net for Truth; but they havenever found her. On the grains of credulity she will not feed; in thenet of wishes her feet cannot be held; in the air of these valleys shewill not breathe. The birds you have caught are of the brood of Lies.Lovely and beautiful, but still lies; Truth knows them not.'"And the hunter cried out in bitterness--"'And must I then sit still, to be devoured of this great burning?'"And the old man said,"'Listen, and in that you have suffered much and wept much, I will tellyou what I know. He who sets out to search for Truth must leave thesevalleys of superstition forever, taking with him not one shred that hasbelonged to them. Alone he must wander down into the Land of AbsoluteNegation and Denial; he must abide there; he must resist temptation;when the light breaks he must arise and follow it into the country ofdry sunshine. The mountains of stern reality will rise before him; hemust climb them; beyond them lies Truth.'"'And he will hold her fast! he will hold her in his hands!' the huntercried."Wisdom shook his head."'He will never see her, never hold her. The time is not yet.'"'Then there is no hope?' cried the hunter."'There is this,' said Wisdom: 'Some men have climbed on thosemountains; circle above circle of bare rock they have scaled; and,wandering there, in those high regions, some have chanced to pick up onthe ground one white silver feather, dropped from the wing of Truth. Andit shall come to pass,' said the old man, raising himself propheticallyand pointing with his finger to the sky, 'it shall come to pass, thatwhen enough of those silver feathers shall have been gathered by thehands of men, and shall have been woven into a cord, and the cord into anet, that in that net Truth may be captured. Nothing but Truth can holdTruth.'"The hunter arose. 'I will go,' he said."But wisdom detained him."'Mark you well--who leaves these valleys never returns to them. Thoughhe should weep tears of blood seven days and nights upon the confines,he can never put his foot across them. Left--they are left forever. Uponthe road which you would travel there is no reward offered. Who goes,goes freely--for the great love that is in him. The work is his reward.'"'I go' said the hunter; 'but upon the mountains, tell me, which pathshall I take?'"'I am the child of The-Accumulated-Knowledge-of-Ages,' said the man; 'Ican walk only where many men have trodden. On these mountains few feethave passed; each man strikes out a path for himself. He goes at his ownperil: my voice he hears no more. I may follow after him, but cannot gobefore him.'"Then Knowledge vanished."And the hunter turned. He went to his cage, and with his hands brokedown the bars, and the jagged iron tore his flesh. It is sometimeseasier to build than to break."One by one he took his plumed birds and let them fly. But when he cameto his dark-plumed bird he held it, and looked into its beautiful eyes,and the bird uttered its low, deep cry--'Immortality!'"And he said quickly: 'I cannot part with it. It is not heavy; it eatsno food. I will hide it in my breast; I will take it with me.' And heburied it there and covered it over with his cloak."But the thing he had hidden grew heavier, heavier, heavier--till it layon his breast like lead. He could not move with it. He could not leavethose valleys with it. Then again he took it out and looked at it."'Oh, my beautiful! my heart's own!' he cried, 'may I not keep you?'"He opened his hands sadly."'Go!' he said. 'It may happen that in Truth's song one note is likeyours; but I shall never hear it.'"Sadly he opened his hand, and the bird flew from him forever."Then from the shuttle of imagination he took the thread of his wishes,and threw it on the ground; and the empty shuttle he put into hisbreast, for the thread was made in those valleys, but the shuttle camefrom an unknown country. He turned to go, but now the people came abouthim, howling."'Fool, hound, demented lunatic!' they cried. 'How dared you break yourcage and let the birds fly?'"The hunter spoke; but they would not hear him."'Truth! who is she? Can you eat her? can you drink her? Who has everseen her? Your birds were real: all could hear them sing! Oh, fool! vilereptile! atheist!' they cried, 'you pollute the air.'"'Come, let us take up stones and stone him,' cried some."'What affair is it of ours?' said others. 'Let the idiot go,' and wentaway. But the rest gathered up stones and mud and threw at him. At last,when he was bruised and cut, the hunter crept away into the woods. Andit was evening about him."At every word the stranger spoke the fellow's eyes flashed back onhim--yes, and yes, and yes! The stranger smiled. It was almost worththe trouble of exerting oneself, even on a lazy afternoon, to win thosepassionate flashes, more thirsty and desiring than the love-glances of awoman."He wandered on and on," said the stranger, "and the shade grew deeper.He was on the borders now of the land where it is always night. Then hestepped into it, and there was no light there. With his hands he groped;but each branch as he touched it broke off, and the earth was coveredwith cinders. At every step his foot sank in, and a fine cloud ofimpalpable ashes flew up into his face; and it was dark. So he sat downupon a stone and buried his face in his hands, to wait in the Land ofNegation and Denial till the light came."And it was night in his heart also."Then from the marshes to his right and left cold mists arose and closedabout him. A fine, imperceptible rain fell in the dark, and great dropsgathered on his hair and clothes. His heart beat slowly, and a numbnesscrept through all his limbs. Then, looking up, two merry wisp lightscame dancing. He lifted his head to look at them. Nearer, nearer theycame. So warm, so bright, they danced like stars of fire. They stoodbefore him at last. From the centre of the radiating flame in one lookedout a woman's face, laughing, dimpled, with streaming yellow hair. Inthe centre of the other were merry laughing ripples, like the bubbles ona glass of wine. They danced before him."'Who are you,' asked the hunter, 'who alone come to me in my solitudeand darkness?'"'We are the twins Sensuality,' they cried. 'Our father's name isHuman-Nature, and our mother's name is Excess. We are as old as thehills and rivers, as old as the first man; but we never die,' theylaughed."'Oh, let me wrap my arms about you!; cried the first; 'they are softand warm. Your heart is frozen now, but I will make it beat. Oh, come tome!'"'I will pour my hot life into you,' said the second; 'your brain isnumb, and your limbs are dead now; but they shall live with a fiercefree life. Oh, let me pour it in!'"'Oh, follow us,' they cried, 'and live with us. Nobler hearts thanyours have sat here in this darkness to wait, and they have come tous and we to them; and they have never left us, never. All else is adelusion, but we are real, we are real, we are real. Truth is a shadow;the valleys of superstition are a farce: the earth is of ashes, thetrees all rotten; but we--feel us--we live! You cannot doubt us. Feel ushow warm we are! Oh, come to us! Come with us!'"Nearer and nearer round his head they hovered, and the cold dropsmelted on his forehead. The bright light shot into his eyes, dazzlinghim, and the frozen blood began to run. And he said:"'Yes, why should I die here in this awful darkness? They are warm, theymelt my frozen blood!' and he stretched out his hands to take them."Then in a moment there arose before him the image of the thing he hadloved, and his hand dropped to his side."'Oh, come to us!' they cried."But he buried his face."'You dazzle my eyes,' he cried, 'you make my heart warm; but you cannotgive me what I desire. I will wait here--wait till I die. Go!'"He covered his face with his hands and would not listen; and when helooked up again they were two twinkling stars, that vanished in thedistance."And the long, long night rolled on."All who leave the valley of superstition pass through that dark land;but some go through it in a few days, some linger there for months, somefor years, and some die there."The boy had crept closer; his hot breath almost touched the stranger'shand; a mystic wonder filled his eyes."At last for the hunter a faint light played along the horizon, and herose to follow it; and he reached that light at last, and stepped intothe broad sunshine. Then before him rose the almighty mountains ofDry-facts and Realities. The clear sunshine played on them, and the topswere lost in the clouds. At the foot many paths ran up. An exultant cryburst from the hunter. He chose the straightest and began to climb;and the rocks and ridges resounded with his song. They had exaggerated;after all, it was not so high, nor was the road so steep! A few days, afew weeks, a few months at most, and then the top! Not one feather onlywould he pick up; he would gather all that other men had found--weavethe net--capture Truth--hold her fast--touch her with his hands--claspher!"He laughed in the merry sunshine, and sang loud. Victory was very near.Nevertheless, after a while the path grew steeper. He needed all hisbreath for climbing, and the singing died away. On the right and leftrose huge rocks, devoid of lichen or moss, and in the lava-like earthchasms yawned. Here and there he saw a sheen of white bones. Now too thepath began to grow less and less marked; then it became a mere trace,with a footmark here and there; then it ceased altogether. He sang nomore, but struck forth a path for himself, until it reached a mightywall of rock, smooth and without break, stretching as far as the eyecould see. 'I will rear a stair against it; and, once this wall climbed,I shall be almost there,' he said bravely; and worked. With his shuttleof imagination he dug out stones; but half of them would not fit, andhalf a month's work would roll down because those below were ill chosen.But the hunter worked on, saying always to himself, 'Once this wallclimbed, I shall be almost there. This great work ended!'"At last he came out upon the top, and he looked about him. Far belowrolled the white mist over the valleys of superstition, and above himtowered the mountains. They had seemed low before; they were of animmeasurable height now, from crown to foundation surrounded by walls ofrock, that rose tier above tier in mighty circles. Upon them playedthe eternal sunshine. He uttered a wild cry. He bowed himself on tothe earth, and when he rose his face was white. In absolute silence hewalked on. He was very silent now. In those high regions the rarefiedair is hard to breathe by those born in the valleys; every breath hedrew hurt him, and the blood oozed out from the tips of his fingers.Before the next wall of rock he began to work. The height of this seemedinfinite, and he said nothing. The sound of his tool rang night and dayupon the iron rocks into which he cut steps. Years passed over him,yet he worked on; but the wall towered up always above him to heaven.Sometimes he prayed that a little moss or lichen might spring up onthose bare walls to be a companion to him; but it never came." Thestranger watched the boy's face."And the years rolled on; he counted them by the steps he had cut--afew for a year--only a few. He sang no more; he said no more, 'I will dothis or that'--he only worked. And at night, when the twilight settleddown, there looked out at him from the holes and crevices in the rocksstrange wild faces."'Stop your work, you lonely man, and speak to us,' they cried."'My salvation is in work, if I should stop but for one moment youwould creep down upon me,' he replied. And they put out their long necksfurther."'Look down into the crevice at your feet,' they said. 'See what liethere--white bones! As brave and strong a man as you climbed to theserocks.' And he looked up. He saw there was no use in striving; he wouldnever hold Truth, never see her, never find her. So he lay down here,for he was very tired. He went to sleep forever. He put himself tosleep. Sleep is very tranquil. You are not lonely when you are asleep,neither do your hands ache, nor your heart. And the hunter laughedbetween his teeth."'Have I torn from my heart all that was dearest; have I wandered alonein the land of night; have I resisted temptation; have I dwelt where thevoice of my kind is never heard, and laboured alone, to lie down and befood for you, ye harpies?'"He laughed fiercely; and the Echoes of Despair slunk away, for thelaugh of a brave, strong heart is as a death blow to them."Nevertheless they crept out again and looked at him."'Do you know that your hair is white?' they said, 'that your handsbegin to tremble like a child's? Do you see that the point of yourshuttle is gone?--it is cracked already. If you should ever climb thisstair,' they said, 'it will be your last. You will never climb another.'"And he answered, 'I know it!' and worked on."The old, thin hands cut the stones ill and jaggedly, for the fingerswere stiff and bent. The beauty and the strength of the man was gone."At last, an old, wizened, shrunken face looked out above the rocks. Itsaw the eternal mountains rise with walls to the white clouds; but itswork was done."The old hunter folded his tired hands and lay down by the precipicewhere he had worked away his life. It was the sleeping time at last.Below him over the valleys rolled the thick white mist. Once it broke;and through the gap the dying eyes looked down on the trees and fieldsof their childhood. From afar seemed borne to him the cry of his ownwild birds, and he heard the noise of people singing as they danced. Andhe thought he heard among them the voices of his old comrades; andhe saw far off the sunlight shine on his early home. And great tearsgathered in the hunter's eyes."'Ah! They who die there do not die alone,' he cried."Then the mists rolled together again; and he turned his eyes away."'I have sought,' he said, 'for long years I have laboured; but I havenot found her. I have not rested, I have not repined, and I have notseen her; now my strength is gone. Where I lie down worn out other menwill stand, young and fresh. By the steps that I have cut they willclimb; by the stairs that I have built they will mount. They will neverknow the name of the man who made them. At the clumsy work they willlaugh; when the stones roll they will curse me. But they will mount, andon my work; they will climb, and by my stair! They will find her, andthrough me! And no man liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself.'"The tears rolled from beneath the shrivelled eyelids. If Truth hadappeared above him in the clouds now he could not have seen her, themist of death was in his eyes."'My soul hears their glad step coming,' he said; 'and they shall mount!they shall mount!' He raised his shrivelled hand to his eyes."Then slowly from the white sky above, through the still air, camesomething falling, falling, falling. Softly it fluttered down, anddropped on to the breast of the dying man. He felt it with his hands. Itwas a feather. He died holding it."The boy had shaded his eyes with his hand. On the wood of the carvinggreat drops fell. The stranger must have laughed at him, or remainedsilent. He did so."How did you know it?" the boy whispered at last. "It is not writtenthere--not on that wood. How did you know it?""Certainly," said the stranger, "the whole of the story is not writtenhere, but it is suggested. And the attribute of all true art, thehighest and the lowest, is this--that it rays more than it says, andtakes you away from itself. It is a little door that opens into aninfinite hall where you may find what you please. Men, thinking todetract, say: 'People read more in this or that work of genius thanwas ever written in it,' not perceiving that they pay the highestcompliment. If we pick up the finger and nail of a real man, we candecipher a whole story--could almost reconstruct the creature again,from head to foot. But half the body of a Mumboo-jumbow idol leaves usutterly in the dark as to what the rest was like. We see what we see,but nothing more. There is nothing so universally intelligible as truth.It has a thousand meanings, and suggests a thousand more."He turned over the wooden thing."Though a man should carve it into matter with the least possiblemanipulative skill, it will yet find interpreters. It is the soul thatlooks out with burning eyes through the most gross fleshly filament.Whosoever should portray truly the life and death of a littleflower--its birth, sucking in of nourishment, reproduction of its kind,withering and vanishing--would have shaped a symbol of all existence.All true facts of nature or the mind are related. Your little carvingrepresents some mental facts as they really are, therefore fiftydifferent true stories might be read from it. What your work wantsis not truth, but beauty of external form, the other half of art." Heleaned almost gently toward the boy. "Skill may come in time, but youwill have to work hard. The love of beauty and the desire for it mustbe born in a man; the skill to reproduce it he must make. He must workhard.""All my life I have longed to see you," the boy said.The stranger broke off the end of his cigar, and lit it. The boy liftedthe heavy wood from the stranger's knee and drew yet nearer him. Inthe dog-like manner of his drawing near there was something superblyridiculous, unless one chanced to view it in another light. Presentlythe stranger said, whiffing, "Do something for me."The boy started up."No; stay where you are. I don't want you to go anyowhere; I want you totalk to me. Tell me what you have been doing all your life."The boy slunk down again. Would that the man had asked him to root upbushes with his hands for his horse to feed on; or to run to the far endof the plain for the fossils that lay there, or to gather the flowersthat grew on the hills at the edge of the plain; he would have run andbeen back quickly--but now!"I have never done anything," he said."Then tell me of that nothing. I like to know what other folks have beendoing whose word I can believe. It is interesting. What was the firstthing you ever wanted very much?"The boy waited to remember, then began hesitatingly, but soon the wordsflowed. In the smallest past we find an inexhaustible mine when once webegin to dig at it.A confused, disordered story--the little made large and the large small,and nothing showing its inward meaning. It is not till the pasthas receded many steps that before the clearest eyes it falls intoco-ordinate pictures. It is not till the I we tell of has ceased toexist that it takes its place among other objective realities, andfinds its true niche in the picture. The present and the near past isa confusion, whose meaning flashes on us as it slinks away into thedistance.The stranger lit one cigar from the end of another, and puffed andlistened with half-closed eyes."I will remember more to tell you if you like," said the boy.He spoke with that extreme gravity common to all very young things whofeel deeply. It is not till twenty that we learn to be in deadly earnestand to laugh. The stranger nodded, while the fellow sought for somethingmore to relate. He would tell all to this man of his--all that he knew,all that he had felt, his inmost sorest thought. Suddenly the strangerturned upon him."Boy," he said, "you are happy to be here."Waldo looked at him. Was his delightful one ridiculing him? Here, withthis brown earth and these low hills, while the rare wonderful world layall beyond. Fortunate to be here?The stranger read his glance."Yes," he said; "here with the karoo-bushes and red sand. Do you wonderwhat I mean? To all who have been born in the old faith there comes atime of danger, when the old slips from us, and we have not yet plantedour feet on the new. We hear the voice from Sinai thundering no more,and the still small voice of reason is not yet heard. We have proved thereligion our mothers fed us on to be a delusion; in our bewilderment wesee no rule by which to guide our steps day by day; and yet every day wemust step somewhere."The stranger leaned forward and spoke more quickly. "We have never oncebeen taught by word or act to distinguish between religion and the morallaws on which it has artfully fastened itself, and from which it hassucked its vitality. When we have dragged down the weeds and creepersthat covered the solid wall and have found them to be rotten wood, weimagine the wall itself to be rotten wood too. We find it is solid andstanding only when we fall headlong against it. We have been taught thatall right and wrong originate in the will of an irresponsible being.It is some time before we see how the inexorable 'Thou shalt and shaltnot,' are carved into the nature of things. This is the time of danger."His dark, misty eyes looked into the boy's."In the end experience will inevitably teach us that the laws for a wiseand noble life have a foundation infinitely deeper than the fiat of anybeing, God or man, even in the groundwork of human nature."She will teach us that whoso sheddeth man's blood, though by man hisblood be not shed, though no man avenge and no hell await, yet everydrop shall blister on his soul and eat in the name of the dead. She willteach that whoso takes a love not lawfully his own, gathers a flowerwith a poison on its petals; that whoso revenges, strikes with a swordthat has two edges--one for his adversary, one for himself; that wholives to himself is dead, though the ground is not yet on him; that whowrongs another clouds his own sun; and that who sins in secretstands accursed and condemned before the one Judge who deals eternaljustice--his own all-knowing self."Experience will teach us this, and reason will show us why it must beso; but at first the world swings before our eyes, and no voice criesout, 'This is the way, walk ye in it!' You are happy to be here, boy!When the suspense fills you with pain you build stone walls and digearth for relief. Others have stood where you stand today, and have feltas you feel; and another relief has been offered them, and they havetaken it."When the day has come when they have seen the path in which they mightwalk, they have not the strength to follow it. Habits have fastened onthem from which nothing but death can free them; which cling closer thanhis sacerdotal sanctimony to a priest; which feed on the intellectlike a worm, sapping energy, hope, creative power, all that makes a manhigher than a beast--leaving only the power to yearn, to regret, and tosink lower in the abyss."Boy," he said, and the listener was not more unsmiling now than thespeaker, "you are happy to be here! Stay where you are. If you everpray, let it be only the one old prayer--'Lead us not into temptation.'Live on here quietly. The time may yet come when you will be that whichother men have hoped to be and never will be now."The stranger rose, shook the dust from his sleeve, and ashamed at hisown earnestness, looked across the bushes for his horse."We should have been on our way already," he said. "We shall have a longride in the dark tonight."Waldo hastened to fetch the animal; but he returned leading it slowly.The sooner it came the sooner would its rider be gone.The stranger was opening his saddlebag, in which were a bright Frenchnovel and an old brown volume. He took the last and held it out to theboy."It may be of some help to you," he said, carelessly. "It was a gospelto me when I first fell on it. You must not expect too much; but it maygive you a centre round which to hang your ideas, instead of lettingthem lie about in a confusion that makes the head ache. We of thisgeneration are not destined to eat and be satisfied as our fathers were;we must be content to go hungry."He smiled his automaton smile, and rebuttoned the bag. Waldo thrust thebook into his breast, and while he saddled the horse the stranger madeinquiries as to the nature of the road and the distance to the nextfarm.When the bags were fixed, Waldo took up his wooden post and beganto fasten it on to the saddle, tying it with the little blue cottonhandkerchief from his neck. The stranger looked on in silence. When itwas done the boy held the stirrup for him to mount."What is your name?" he inquired, ungloving his right hand when he wasin the saddle.The boy replied:"Well, I trust we shall meet again some day, sooner or later."He shook hands with the ungloved hand; then drew on the glove, andtouched his horse, and rode slowly away. The boy stood to watch him.Once when the stranger had gone half across the plain he looked back."Poor devil," he said, smiling and stroking his moustache. Then helooked to see if the little blue handkerchief were still safely knotted."Poor devil!"He smiled, and then he sighed wearily, very wearily.And Waldo waited till the moving speck had disappeared on the horizon;then he stooped and kissed passionately a hoof-mark in the sand. Thenhe called his young birds together, and put his book under his arm, andwalked home along the stone wall. There was a rare beauty to him in thesunshine that evening.Chapter 2.III. Gregory Rose Finds His Affinity.The new man, Gregory Rose, sat at the door of his dwelling, his armsfolded, his legs crossed, and a profound melancholy seeming to rest overhis soul. His house was a little square daub-and-wattle building, farout in the karoo, two miles from the homestead. It was covered outsidewith a sombre coating of brown mud, two little panes being let into thewalls for windows. Behind it were the sheep-kraals, and to the righta large dam, now principally containing baked mud. Far off the littlekopje concealed the homestead, and was not itself an object conspicuousenough to relieve the dreary monotony of the landscape.Before the door sat Gregory Rose in his shirt-sleeves, on a camp-stool,and ever and anon he sighed deeply. There was that in his countenancefor which even his depressing circumstances failed to account. Again andagain he looked at the little kopje, at the milk-pail at his side,and at the brown pony, who a short way off cropped the dry bushes--andsighed.Presently he rose and went into his house. It was one tiny room,the whitewashed walls profusely covered with prints cut from the"Illustrated London News", and in which there was a noticeablepreponderance of female faces and figures. A stretcher filled one endof the hut, and a rack for a gun and a little hanging looking-glassdiversified the gable opposite, while in the centre stood a chair andtable. All was scrupulously neat and clean, for Gregory kept a littleduster folded in the corner of his table-drawer, just as he had seen hismother do, and every morning before he went out he said his prayers, andmade his bed, and dusted the table and the legs of the chairs, and eventhe pictures on the wall and the gun-rack.On this hot afternoon he took from beneath his pillow a watch-bag madeby his sister Jemima, and took out the watch. Only half past four! Witha suppressed groan he dropped it back and sat down beside the table.Half-past four! Presently he roused himself. He would write to hissister Jemima. He always wrote to her when he was miserable. She was hissafety-valve. He forgot her when he was happy; but he used her when hewas wretched.He took out ink and paper. There was a family crest and motto on thelatter, for the Roses since coming to the colony had discovered thatthey were of distinguished lineage. Old Rose himself, an honest Englishfarmer, knew nothing of his noble descent; but his wife and daughterknew--especially his daughter. There were Roses in England who kept apark and dated from the Conquest. So the colonial "Rose Farm" became"Rose Manor" in remembrance of the ancestral domain, and the claim ofthe Roses to noble blood was established--in their own minds at least.Gregory took up one of the white, crested sheets; but on deeperreflection he determined to take a pink one, as more suitable to thestate of his feelings. He began:"Kopje Alone,"Monday afternoon."My Dear Jemima--"Then he looked up into the little glass opposite. It was a youthful facereflected there, with curling brown beard and hair; but in the dark blueeyes there was a look of languid longing that touched him. He re-dippedhis pen and wrote:"When I look up into the little glass that hangs opposite me, I wonderif that changed and sad face--"Here he sat still and reflected. It sounded almost as if he might beconceited or unmanly to be looking at his own face in the glass. No,that would not do. So he looked for another pink sheet and began again."Kopje Alone, "Monday afternoon."Dear Sister,--It is hardly six months since I left you to come to thisspot, yet could you now see me I know what you would say, I know whatmother would say--'Can that be our Greg--that thing with the strangelook in his eyes?'"Yes, Jemima, it is your Greg, and the change has been coming over meever since I came here; but it is greatest since yesterday. You knowwhat sorrows I have passed through, Jemima; how unjustly I was alwaystreated at school, the masters keeping me back and calling me ablockhead, though, as they themselves allowed, I had the best memory ofany boy in the school, and could repeat whole books from beginning toend. You know how cruelly father always used me, calling me a noodle anda milksop, just because he couldn't understand my fine nature. You knowhow he has made a farmer of me instead of a minister, as I ought to havebeen; you know it all, Jemima; and how I have borne it all, not as awoman, who whines for every touch, but as a man should--in silence."But there are things, there is a thing, which the soul longs to pourforth into a kindred ear."Dear sister, have you ever known what it is to keep wanting and wantingand wanting to kiss some one's mouth, and you may not; to touch someone's hand, and you cannot? I am in love, Jemima."The old Dutchwoman from whom I hire this place has a littlestepdaughter, and her name begins with 'E'."She is English. I do not know how her father came to marry aBoer-woman. It makes me feel so strange to put down that letter, that Ican hardly go on writing 'E'. I've loved her ever since I came here. Forweeks I have not been able to eat or drink; my very tobacco when I smokehas no taste; and I can remain for no more than five minutes in oneplace, and sometimes feel as though I were really going mad."Every evening I go there to fetch my milk. Yesterday she gave me somecoffee. The spoon fell on the ground. She picked it up; when she gaveit me her finger touched mine. Jemima, I do not know if I fancied it--Ishivered hot, and she shivered too! I thought, 'It is all right; shewill be mine; she loves me!' Just then, Jemima, in came a fellow, agreat, coarse fellow, a German--a ridiculous fellow, with curls rightdown to his shoulders; it makes one sick to look at him. He's only aservant of the Boer-woman's, and a low, vulgar, uneducated thing; that'snever been to boarding-school in his life. He had been to the next farmseeking sheep. When he came in she said, 'Good evening, Waldo. Have somecoffee!' AND SHE KISSED HIM."All last night I heard nothing else but 'Have some coffee; have somecoffee.' If I went to sleep for a moment I dreamed that her fingerwas pressing mine; but when I woke with a start I heard her say, 'Goodevening, Waldo. Have some coffee!'"Is this madness?"I have not eaten a mouthful today. This evening I go and propose toher. If she refuses me I shall go and kill myself tomorrow. There is adam of water close by. The sheep have drunk most of it up, but there isstill enough if I tie a stone to my neck."It is a choice between death and madness. I can endure no more. If thisshould be the last letter you ever get from me, think of me tenderly,and forgive me. Without her, life would be a howling wilderness, a longtribulation. She is my affinity; the one love of my life, of my youth,of my manhood; my sunshine; my God-given blossom.    "'They never loved who dreamed that they loved once,      And who saith, 'I loved once'?--      Not angels, whose deep eyes look down through realms of light!'"Your disconsolate brother, on what is, in all probability, the last anddistracted night of his life."Gregory Nazianzen Rose."P.S.--Tell mother to take care of my pearl studs. I left them in thewash-hand-stand drawer. Don't let the children get hold of them."P.P.S.--I shall take this letter with me to the farm. If I turn downone corner you may know I have been accepted; if not, you may know it isall up with your heartbroken brother,"G.N.R."Gregory having finished this letter, read it over with much approval,put it in an envelope, addressed it, and sat contemplating the inkpot,somewhat relieved in mind.The evening turned out chilly and very windy after the day's heat. Fromafar off, as Gregory neared the homestead on the brown pony, he coulddistinguish a little figure in a little red cloak at the door of thecow-kraal. Em leaned over the poles that barred the gate, and watchedthe frothing milk run through the black fingers of the herdsman, whilethe unwilling cows stood with tethered heads by the milking poles. Shehad thrown the red cloak over her own head, and held it under her chinwith a little hand, to keep from her ears the wind, that playfully shookit, and tossed the little fringe of yellow hair into her eyes."Is it not too cold for you to be standing here?" said Gregory, comingsoftly close to her."Oh, no; it is so nice. I always come to watch the milking. That red cowwith the short horns is bringing up the calf of the white cow that died.She loves it so--just as if it were her own. It is so nice to see herlick its little ears. Just look!""The clouds are black. I think it is going to rain tonight," saidGregory."Yes," answered Em, looking up as well as she could for the littleyellow fringe."But I'm sure you must be cold," said Gregory, and put his hand underthe cloak, and found there a small fist doubled up, soft, and very warm.He held it fast in his hand."Oh, Em, I love you better than all the world besides! Tell me, do youlove me a little?""Yes, I do," said Em, hesitating, and trying softly to free her hand."Better than everything; better than all the world, darling?" he asked,bending down so low that the yellow hair was blown into his eyes."I don't know," said Em, gravely. "I do love you very much; but I lovemy cousin who is at school, and Waldo, very much. You see I have knownthem so long!""Oh, Em, do not talk to me so coldly!" Gregory cried, seizing the littlearm that rested on the gate, and pressing it till she was half afraid.The herdsman had moved away to the other end of the kraal now, and thecows, busy with their calves, took no notice of the little human farce."Em, if you talk so to me I will go mad! You must love me, love mebetter than all! You must give yourself to me. I have loved you sincethat first moment when I saw you walking by the stone wall with the jugin your hands. You were made for me, created for me! I will love youtill I die! Oh, Em, do not be so cold, so cruel to me!"He held her arm so tightly that her fingers relaxed their hold, and thecloak fluttered down on to the ground, and the wind played more roughlythan ever with the little yellow head."I do love you very much," she said; "but I do not know if I want tomarry you. I love you better than Waldo, but I can't tell if I love youbetter than Lyndall. If you would let me wait for a week I think perhapsI could tell you."Gregory picked up the cloak and wrapped it round her."If you could but love me as I love you," he said; "but no woman canlove as a man can. I will wait till Saturday. I will not once come nearyou till then. Good-bye! Oh, Em," he said, turning again, and twininghis arm about her, and kissing her surprised little mouth, "if you arenot my wife I cannot live. I have never loved another woman, and I nevershall!--never, never!""You make me afraid," said Em. "Come, let us go, and I will fill yourpail.""I want no milk. Good-bye! You will not see me again till Saturday."Late that night, when every one else had gone to bed, the yellow-hairedlittle woman stood alone in the kitchen. She had come to fill the kettlefor the next morning's coffee, and now stood before the fire. The warmreflection lit the grave old-womanish little face, that was so unusuallythoughtful this evening."Better than all the world; better than everything; he loves me betterthan everything!" She said the words aloud, as if they were more easyto believe if she spoke them so. She had given out so much love in herlittle life, and had got none of it back with interest. Now one said, "Ilove you better than all the world." One loved her better than she lovedhim. How suddenly rich she was. She kept clasping and unclasping herhands. So a beggar feels who falls asleep on the pavement wet andhungry, and who wakes in a palace-hall with servants and lights, and afeast before him. Of course the beggar's is only a dream, and he wakesfrom it; and this was real.Gregory had said to her, "I will love you as long as I live." She saidthe words over and over to herself like a song."I will send for him tomorrow, and I will tell him how I love him back,"she said.But Em needed not to send for him. Gregory discovered on reaching homethat Jemima's letter was still in his pocket. And, therefore, much as hedisliked the appearance of vacillation and weakness, he was obliged tobe at the farmhouse before sunrise to post it."If I see her," Gregory said, "I shall only bow to her. She shall seethat I am a man, one who keeps his word."As to Jemima's letter, he had turned down one corner of the page, andthen turned it back, leaving a deep crease. That would show that he wasneither accepted nor rejected, but that matters were in an intermediatecondition. It was a more poetical way then putting it in plain words.Gregory was barely in time with his letter, for Waldo was starting whenhe reached the homestead, and Em was on the doorstep to see him off.When he had given the letter, and Waldo had gone, Gregory bowed stifflyand prepared to remount his own pony, but somewhat slowly. It was stillearly; none of the servants were about. Em came up close to him and puther little hand softly on his arm as he stood by his horse."I do love you best of all," she said. She was not frightened now,however much he kissed her. "I wish I was beautiful and nice," sheadded, looking up into his eyes as he held her against his breast."My darling, to me you are more beautiful than all the women in theworld; dearer to me than everything it holds. If you were in hell Iwould go after you to find you there! If you were dead, though my bodymoved, my soul would be under the ground with you. All life as I passwith you in my arms will be perfect to me. It will pass, pass like a rayof sunshine."Em thought how beautiful and grand his face was as she looked up intoit. She raised her hand gently and put it on his forehead."You are so silent, so cold, my Em," he cried. "Have you nothing to sayto me?"A little shade of wonder filled her eyes."I will do everything you tell me," she said."What else could she say? Her idea of love was only service."Then, my own precious one, promise never to kiss that fellow again. Icannot bear that you should love any one but me. You must not! I willnot have it! If every relation I had in the world were to die tomorrow,I would be quite happy if I still only had you! My darling, my love, whyare you so cold? Promise me not to love him any more. If you asked me todo anything for you, I would do it, though it cost my life."Em put her hand very gravely round his neck."I will never kiss him," she said, "and I will try not to love any oneelse. But I do not know if I will be able.""Oh, my darling, I think of you all night, all day. I think of nothingelse, love, nothing else," he said, folding his arms about her.Em was a little conscience stricken; even that morning she had foundtime to remember that in six months her cousin would come back fromschool, and she had thought to remind Waldo of the lozenges for hiscough, even when she saw Gregory coming."I do not know how it is," she said humbly, nestling to him, "but Icannot love you so much as you love me. Perhaps it is because I am onlya woman; but I do love you as much as I can."Now the Kaffer maids were coming from the huts. He kissed her again,eyes and mouth and hands, and left her.Tant Sannie was well satisfied when told of the betrothment. She herselfcontemplated marriage within the year with one or other of her numerousvrijers, and she suggested that the weddings might take place together.Em set to work busily to prepare her own household linen and weddinggarments. Gregory was with her daily, almost hourly, and the six monthswhich elapsed before Lyndall's return passed, as he felicitously phrasedit, "like a summer night, when you are dreaming of some one you love."Late one evening, Gregory sat by his little love, turning the handleof her machine as she drew her work through it, and they talked ofthe changes they would make when the Boer-woman was gone, and the farmbelonged to them alone. There should be a new room here, and a kraalthere. So they chatted on. Suddenly Gregory dropped the handle, andimpressed a fervent kiss on the fat hand that guided the linen."You are so beautiful, Em," said the lover. "It comes over me in a floodsuddenly how I love you."Em smiled."Tant Sannie says when I am her age no one will look at me; and it istrue. My hands are as short and broad as a duck's foot, and my foreheadis so low, and I haven't any nose. I can't be pretty."She laughed softly. It was so nice to think he should be so blind."When my cousin comes tomorrow you will see a beautiful woman, Gregory,"she added presently. "She is like a little queen: her shoulders are soupright, and her head looks as though it ought to have a little crownupon it. You must come to see her tomorrow as soon as she comes. I amsure you will love her.""Of course I shall come to see her, since she is your cousin; but do youthink I could ever think any woman as lovely as I think you?"He fixed his seething eyes upon her."You could not help seeing that she is prettier," said Em, slipping herright hand into his; "but you will never be able to like any one so muchas you like me."Afterward, when she wished her lover good night, she stood upon thedoorstep to call a greeting after him; and she waited, as she alwaysdid, till the brown pony's hoofs became inaudible behind the kopje.Then she passed through the room where Tant Sannie lay snoring, andthrough the little room that was all draped in white, waiting for hercousin's return, on to her own room.She went to the chest of drawers to put away the work she had finished,and sat down on the floor before the lowest drawer. In it were thethings she was preparing for her marriage. Piles of white linen, andsome aprons and quilts; and in a little box in the corner a spray oforange-blossom which she had bought from a smouse. There, too, was aring Gregory had given her, and a veil his sister had sent, and therewas a little roll of fine embroidered work which Trana had given her. Itwas too fine and good even for Gregory's wife--just right for somethingvery small and soft. She would keep it. And she touched it gently withher forefinger, smiling; and then she blushed and hid it far behind theother things. She knew so well all that was in that drawer, and yet sheturned them all over as though she saw them for the first time, packedthem all out, and packed them all in, without one fold or crumple; andthen sat down and looked at them.Tomorrow evening when Lyndall came she would bring her here, and showit her all. Lyndall would so like to see it--the little wreath, and thering, and the white veil! It would be so nice! Then Em fell to seeingpictures. Lyndall should live with them till she herself got marriedsome day.Every day when Gregory came home, tired from his work, he would lookabout and say, "Where is my wife? Has no one seen my wife? Wife, somecoffee!" and she would give him some.Em's little face grew very grave at last, and she knelt up and extendedher hands over the drawer of linen."Oh, God!" she said, "I am so glad! I do not know what I have done thatI should be so glad. Thank you!"Chapter 2.IV. Lyndall.She was more like a princess, yes, far more like a princess, than thelady who still hung on the wall in Tant Sannie's bedroom. So Em thought.She leaned back in the little armchair; she wore a grey dressing-gown,and her long hair was combed out and hung to the ground. Em, sittingbefore her, looked up with mingled respect and admiration.Lyndall was tired after her long journey, and had come to her roomearly. Her eyes ran over the familiar objects. Strange to go away forfour years, and come back, and find that the candle standing on thedressing-table still cast the shadow of an old crone's head in thecorner beyond the clothes-horse. Strange that even a shadow should lastlonger than a man! She looked about among the old familiar objects; allwas there, but the old self was gone."What are you noticing?" asked Em."Nothing and everything. I thought the windows were higher. If I wereyou, when I get this place I should raise the walls. There is not roomto breathe here. One suffocates.""Gregory is going to make many alterations," said Em; and drawing nearerto the grey dressing-gown respectfully. "Do you like him, Lyndall? Is henot handsome?""He must have been a fine baby," said Lyndall, looking at the whitedimity curtain that hung above the window.Em was puzzled."There are some men," said Lyndall, "whom you never can believe werebabies at all; and others you never see without thinking how very nicethey must have looked when they wore socks and pink sashes."Em remained silent; then she said with a little dignity, "When you knowhim you will love him as I do. When I compare other people with him,they seem so weak and little. Our hearts are so cold, our loves aremixed up with so many other things. But he--no one is worthy of hislove. I am not. It is so great and pure.""You need not make yourself unhappy on that point--your poor return forhis love, my dear," said Lyndall. "A man's love is a fire of olive-wood.It leaps higher every moment; it roars, it blazes, it shoots out redflames; it threatens to wrap you round and devour you--you who stand bylike an icicle in the glow of its fierce warmth. You are self-reproachedat your own chilliness and want of reciprocity. The next day, when yougo to warm your hands a little, you find a few ashes! 'Tis a long loveand cool against a short love and hot; men, at all events, have nothingto complain of.""You speak so because you do not know men," said Em, instantly assumingthe dignity of superior knowledge so universally affected by affiancedand married women in discussing man's nature with their uncontractedsisters."You will know them too some day, and then you will think differently,"said Em, with the condescending magnanimity which superior knowledge canalways afford to show to ignorance.Lyndall's little lip quivered in a manner indicative of intenseamusement. She twirled a massive ring upon her forefinger--a ring moresuitable for the hand of a man, and noticeable in design--a diamondcross let into gold, with the initials "R.R." below it."Ah, Lyndall," Em cried, "perhaps you are engaged yourself--that is whyyou smile. Yes; I am sure you are. Look at this ring!"Lyndall drew the hand quickly from her."I am not in so great a hurry to put my neck beneath any man's foot;and I do not so greatly admire the crying of babies," she said, as sheclosed her eyes half wearily and leaned back in the chair. "There areother women glad of such work."Em felt rebuked and ashamed. How could she take Lyndall and show herthe white linen and the wreath, and the embroidery? She was quiet fora little while, and then began to talk about Trana and the oldfarm-servants, till she saw her companion was weary; then she rose andleft her for the night. But after Em was gone Lyndall sat on, watchingthe old crone's face in the corner, and with a weary look, as though thewhole world's weight rested on these frail young shoulders.The next morning, Waldo, starting off before breakfast with a bag ofmealies slung over his shoulder to feed the ostriches, heard a lightstep behind him."Wait for me; I am coming with you," said Lyndall, adding as she came upto him, "if I had not gone to look for you yesterday you would not havecome to greet me till now. Do you not like me any longer, Waldo?""Yes--but--you are changed."It was the old clumsy, hesitating mode of speech."You like the pinafores better?" she said quickly. She wore a dress ofa simple cotton fabric, but very fashionably made, and on her head wasa broad white hat. To Waldo she seemed superbly attired. She saw it. "Mydress has changed a little," she said, "and I also; but not to you. Hangthe bag over your other shoulder, that I may see your face. You sayso little that if one does not look at you you are an uncomprehendedcipher." Waldo changed the bag, and they walked on side by side. "Youhave improved," she said. "Do you know that I have sometimes wished tosee you while I was away; not often, but still sometimes."They were at the gate of the first camp now. Waldo threw over a bag ofmealies, and they walked on over the dewy ground."Have you learnt much?" he asked her simply, remembering how she hadonce said, "When I come back again I shall know everything that a humanbeing can."She laughed."Are you thinking of my old boast? Yes; I have learnt something, thoughhardly what I expected, and not quite so much. In the first place, Ihave learnt that one of my ancestors must have been a very great fool;for they say nothing comes out in a man but one of his forefatherspossessed it before him. In the second place, I have discovered thatof all cursed places under the sun, where the hungriest soul can hardlypick up a few grains of knowledge, a girls' boarding-school is theworst. They are called finishing schools, and the name tells accuratelywhat they are. They finish everything but imbecility and weakness, andthat they cultivate. They are nicely adapted machines for experimentingon the question, 'Into how little space a human soul can be crushed?'I have seen some souls so compressed that they would have fitted into asmall thimble, and found room to move there--wide room. A woman who hasbeen for many years in one of those places carries the mark of the beaston her till she dies, though she may expand a little afterward, when shebreathes in the free world.""Were you miserable?" he asked, looking at her with quick anxiety."I?--no. I am never miserable and never happy. I wish I were. But Ishould have run away from the place on the fourth day, and hired myselfto the first Boer-woman whose farm I came to, to make fire under hersoap-pot, if I had to live as the rest of the drove did. Can you form anidea, Waldo, of what it must be to be shut up with cackling old women,who are without knowledge of life, without love of the beautiful,without strength, to have your soul cultured by them? It is suffocationonly to breathe the air they breathe; but I made them give me room. Itold them I should leave, and they knew I came there on my own account;so they gave me a bedroom without the companionship of one of thosethings that were having their brains slowly diluted and squeezed out ofthem. I did not learn music, because I had no talent; and when thedrove made cushions, and hideous flowers that the roses laugh at, anda footstool in six weeks that a machine would have made better in fiveminutes, I went to my room. With the money saved from such work I boughtbooks and newspapers, and at night I sat up. I read, and epitomized whatI read; and I found time to write some plays, and find out how hard itis to make your thoughts look anything but imbecile fools when you paintthem with ink and paper. In the holidays I learnt a great deal more. Imade acquaintances, saw a few places and many people, and some differentways of living, which is more than any books can show one. On the whole,I am not dissatisfied with my four years. I have not learnt what Iexpected; but I have learnt something else. What have you been doing?""Nothing.""That is not possible. I shall find out by and by."They still stepped on side by side over the dewy bushes. Then suddenlyshe turned on him."Don't you wish you were a woman, Waldo?""No," he answered readily.She laughed."I thought not. Even you are too worldly-wise for that. I never met aman who did. This is a pretty ring," she said, holding out her littlehand, that the morning sun might make the diamonds sparkle. "Worth fiftypounds at least. I will give it to the first man who tells me he wouldlike to be a woman. There might be one on Robbin Island (lunatics at theCape are sent to Robbin Island) who would win it perhaps, but I doubtit even there. It is delightful to be a woman; but every man thanks theLord devoutly that he isn't one."She drew her hat to one side to keep the sun out of her eyes as shewalked. Waldo looked at her so intently that he stumbled over thebushes. Yes, this was his little Lyndall who had worn the checkpinafores; he saw it now, and he walked closer beside her. They reachedthe next camp."Let us wait at this camp and watch the birds," she said, as an ostrichhen came bounding toward them with velvety wings outstretched, while faraway over the bushes the head of the cock was visible as he sat broodingon the eggs.Lyndall folded her arms on the gate bar, and Waldo threw his empty bagon the wall and leaned beside her."I like these birds," she said; "they share each other's work, and arecompanions. Do you take an interest in the position of women, Waldo?""No.""I thought not. No one does, unless they are in need of a subject uponwhich to show their wit. And as for you, from of old you can see nothingthat is not separated from you by a few millions of miles, and strewedover with mystery. If women were the inhabitants of Jupiter, of whom youhad happened to hear something, you would pore over us and our conditionnight and day; but because we are before your eyes you never look at us.You care nothing that this is ragged and ugly," she said, puttingher little finger on his sleeve; "but you strive mightily to make animaginary leaf on an old stick beautiful. I'm sorry you don't care forthe position of women; I should have liked us to be friends; and it isthe only thing about which I think much or feel much--if, indeed, Ihave any feeling about anything," she added, flippantly, readjusting herdainty little arms. "When I was a baby, I fancy my parents left me outin the frost one night, and I got nipped internally--it feels so!""I have only a few old thoughts," he said, "and I think them over andover again; always beginning where I left off. I never get any further.I am weary of them.""Like an old hen that sits on its eggs month after month and they nevercome out?" she said quickly. "I am so pressed in upon by new thingsthat, lest they should trip one another up, I have to keep forcingthem back. My head swings sometimes. But this one thought stands, nevergoes--if I might but be one of these born in the future; then, perhaps,to be born a woman will not be to be born branded."Waldo looked at her. It was hard to say whether she were in earnest ormocking."I know it is foolish. Wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it can'tbring down," she said. "But we are cursed. Waldo, born cursed from thetime our mothers bring us into the world till the shrouds are put on us.Do not look at me as though I were talking nonsense. Everything has twosides--the outside that is ridiculous, and the inside that is solemn.""I am not laughing," said the boy, sedately enough; "but what cursesyou?"He thought she would not reply to him, she waited so long."It is not what is done to us, but what is made of us," she said atlast, "that wrongs us. No man can be really injured but by what modifieshimself. We all enter the world little plastic beings, with so muchnatural force, perhaps, but for the rest--blank; and the world tells uswhat we are to be, and shapes us by the ends it sets before us. Toyou it says--"Work;" and to us it says--"Seem!" To you it says--As youapproximate to man's highest ideal of God, as your arm is strong andyour knowledge great, and the power to labour is with you, so you shallgain all that human heart desires. To us it says--Strength shall nothelp you, nor knowledge, nor labour. You shall gain what men gain, butby other means. And so the world makes men and women."Look at this little chin of mine, Waldo, with the dimple in it. Itis but a small part of my person; but though I had a knowledge of allthings under the sun, and the wisdom to use it, and the deep lovingheart of an angel, it would not stead me through life like this littlechin. I can win money with it, I can win love; I can win power with it,I can win fame. What would knowledge help me? The less a woman has inher head the lighter she is for climbing. I once heard an old man say,that he never saw intellect help a woman so much as a pretty ankle; andit was the truth. They begin to shape us to our cursed end," she said,with her lips drawn in to look as though they smiled, "when we are tinythings in shoes and socks. We sit with our little feet drawn up under usin the window, and look out at the boys in their happy play. We want togo. Then a loving hand is laid on us: 'Little one, you cannot go,' theysay, 'your little face will burn, and your nice white dress be spoiled.'We feel it must be for our good, it is so lovingly said: but we cannotunderstand; and we kneel still with one little cheek wistfully pressedagainst the pane. Afterwards we go and thread blue beads, and make astring for our neck; and we go and stand before the glass. We see thecomplexion we were not to spoil, and the white frock, and we look intoour own great eyes. Then the curse begins to act on us. It finishes itswork when we are grown women, who no more look out wistfully at a morehealthy life; we are contented. We fit our sphere as a Chinese woman'sfoot fits her shoe, exactly, as though God had made both--and yet heknows nothing of either. In some of us the shaping of our end has beenquite completed. The parts we are not to use have been quite atrophied,and have even dropped off; but in others, and we are not less to bepitied, they have been weakened and left. We wear the bandages, but ourlimbs have not grown to them; we know that we are compressed, and chafeagainst them."But what does it help? A little bitterness, a little longing whenwe are young, a little futile searching for work, a little passionatestriving for room for the exercise of our powers,--and then we go withthe drove. A woman must march with her regiment. In the end she must betrodden down or go with it; and if she is wise she goes."I see in your great eyes what you are thinking," she said, glancing athim; "I always know what the person I am talking to is thinking of. Howis this woman who makes such a fuss worse off than I? I will show youby a very little example. We stand here at this gate this morning, bothpoor, both young, both friendless; there is not much to choose betweenus. Let us turn away just as we are, to make our way in life. Thisevening you will come to a farmer's house. The farmer, albeit you comealone on foot, will give you a pipe of tobacco and a cup of coffee anda bed. If he has no dam to build and no child to teach, tomorrow you cango on your way, with a friendly greeting of the hand. I, if I come tothe same place tonight, will have strange questions asked me, strangeglances cast on me. The Boer-wife will shake her head and give me foodto eat with the Kaffers, and a right to sleep with the dogs. That wouldbe the first step in our progress--a very little one, but every step tothe end would repeat it. We were equals once when we lay new-born babeson our nurses' knees. We will be equals again when they tie up our jawsfor the last sleep!"Waldo looked in wonder at the little quivering face; it was a glimpseinto a world of passion and feeling wholly new to him."Mark you," she said, "we have always this advantage over you--we can atany time step into ease and competence, where you must labour patientlyfor it. A little weeping, a little wheedling, a little self-degradation,a little careful use of our advantages, and then some man will say:"Come, be my wife!" With good looks and youth marriage is easy toattain. There are men enough; but a woman who has sold herself, even fora ring and a new name, need hold her skirt aside for no creature in thestreet. They both earn their bread in one way. Marriage for love is thebeautifulest external symbol of the union of souls; marriage without itis the uncleanliest traffic that defiles the world." She ran her littlefinger savagely along the topmost bar, shaking off the dozen littledewdrops that still hung there. "And they tell us we have men'schivalrous attention!" she cried. "When we ask to be doctors, lawyers,law-makers, anything but ill-paid drudges, they say--No; but you havemen's chivalrous attention; now think of that and be satisfied! Whatwould you do without it?"The bitter little silvery laugh, so seldom heard, rang out across thebushes. She bit her little teeth together."I was coming up in Cobb & Co.'s the other day. At a little waysidehotel we had to change the large coach for a small one. We were tenpassengers, eight men and two women. As I sat in the house the gentlemencame and whispered to me, 'There is not room for all in the new coach,take your seat quickly.' We hurried out, and they gave me the bestseat, and covered me with rugs, because it was drizzling. Then the lastpassenger came running up to the coach--an old woman with a wonderfulbonnet, and a black shawl pinned with a yellow pin."'There is no room,' they said; 'you must wait till next week's coachtakes you up;' but she climbed on to the step, and held on at the windowwith both hands."'My son-in-law is ill, and I must go and see him,' she said."'My good woman,' said one, 'I am really exceedingly sorry that yourson-in-law is ill; but there is absolutely no room for you here.'"'You had better get down,' said another, 'or the wheel will catch you.'"I got up to give her my place."'Oh, no, no!' they cried, 'we will not allow that.'"'I will rather kneel,' said one, and he crouched down at my feet; sothe woman came in."There were nine of us in that coach, and only one showed chivalrousattention--and that was a woman to a woman."I shall be old and ugly, too, one day, and I shall look for men'schivalrous help, but I shall not find it."The bees are very attentive to the flowers till their honey is done,and then they fly over them. I don't know if the flowers feel gratefulto the bees; they are great fools if they do.""But some women," said Waldo, speaking as though the words forcedthemselves from him at that moment, "some women have power."She lifted her beautiful eyes to his face."Power! Did you ever hear of men being asked whether other souls shouldhave power or not? It is born in them. You may dam up the fountain ofwater, and make it a stagnant marsh, or you may let it run free and doits work; but you cannot say whether it shall be there; it is there. Andit will act, if not openly for good, then covertly for evil; but itwill act. If Goethe had been stolen away a child, and reared in a robberhorde in the depths of a German forest, do you think the world wouldhave had "Faust" and "Iphegenie?" But he would have been Goethestill--stronger, wiser than his fellows. At night, round theirwatch-fire, he would have chanted wild songs of rapine and murder, tillthe dark faces about him were moved and trembled. His songs would haveechoed on from father to son, and nerved the heart and arm--for evil.Do you think if Napoleon had been born a woman that he would have beencontented to give small tea-parties and talk small scandal? He wouldhave risen; but the world would not have heard of him as it hears of himnow--a man great and kingly with all his sins; he would have left oneof those names that stain the leaf of every history--the names of women,who, having power, but being denied the right to exercise it openly,rule in the dark, covertly, and by stealth, through the men whosepassions they feed on and by whom they climb."Power!" she said, suddenly, smiting her little hand upon the rail."Yes, we have power; and since we are not to expend it in tunnellingmountains, nor healing diseases, nor making laws, nor money, nor onany extraneous object, we expend it on you. You are our goods, ourmerchandise, our material for operating on; we buy you, we sell you, wemake fools of you, we act the wily old Jew with you, we keep six of youcrawling to our little feet, and praying only for a touch of our littlehand; and they say truly, there was never an ache or pain or brokenheart but a woman was at the bottom of it. We are not to study law, norscience, nor art, so we study you. There is never a nerve or fibre in aman's nature but we know it. We keep six of you dancing in the palm ofone little hand," she said, balancing her outstretched arm gracefully,as though tiny beings disported themselves in its palm. "There, wethrow you away, and you sink to the devil," she said, folding her armscomposedly. "There was never a man who said one word for woman but hesaid two for man, and three for the whole human race."She watched the bird pecking up the last yellow grains; but Waldo lookedonly at her.When she spoke again it was very measuredly."They bring weighty arguments against us when we ask for the perfectfreedom of women," she said; "but, when you come to the objections, theyare like pumpkin devils with candles inside, hollow, and can't bite.They say that women do not wish for the sphere and freedom we ask forthem, and would not use it!"If the bird does like its cage, and does like its sugar and will notleave it, why keep the door so very carefully shut? Why not open it,only a little? Do they know there is many a bird will not break itswings against the bars, but would fly if the doors were open?" She knither forehead and leaned further over the bars."Then they say, 'If the women have the liberty you ask for, they will befound in positions for which they are not fitted!' If two men climbone ladder, did you ever see the weakest anywhere but at the foot? Thesurest sign of fitness is success. The weakest never wins but wherethere is handicapping. Nature, left to herself, will as beautifullyapportion a man's work to his capacities as long ages ago she graduatedthe colours on the bird's breast. If we are not fit, you give us, to nopurpose, the right to labour; the work will fall out of our hands intothose that are wiser."She talked more rapidly as she went on, as one talks of that over whichthey have brooded long, and which lies near their hearts.Waldo watched her intently."They say women have one great and noble work left them, and they do itill. That is true; they do it execrably. It is the work that demands thebroadest culture, and they have not even the narrowest. The lawyer maysee no deeper than his law-books, and the chemist see no further thanthe windows of his laboratory, and they may do their work well. But thewoman who does woman's work needs a many-sided, multiform culture; theheights and depths of human life must not be beyond the reach of hervision; she must have knowledge of men and things in many states, a widecatholicity of sympathy, the strength that springs from knowledge, andthe magnanimity which springs from strength. We bear the world, andwe make it. The souls of little children are marvellously delicate andtender things, and keep forever the shadow that first falls on them, andthat is the mother's or at best a woman's. There was never a great manwho had not a great mother--it is hardly an exaggeration. The first sixyears of our life make us; all that is added later is veneer; and yetsome say, if a woman can cook a dinner or dress herself well she hasculture enough."The mightiest and noblest of human work is given to us, and we do itill. Send a navvie to work into an artist's studio, and see what youwill find there! And yet, thank God, we have this work," she added,quickly--"it is the one window through which we see into the greatworld of earnest labour. The meanest girl who dances and dresses becomessomething higher when her children look up into her face and ask herquestions. It is the only education we have and which they cannot takefrom us."She smiled slightly. "They say that we complain of woman's beingcompelled to look upon marriage as a profession; but that she is free toenter upon it or leave it, as she pleases."Yes--and a cat set afloat in a pond is free to sit in the tub till itdies there, it is under no obligation to wet its feet; and a drowningman may catch at a straw or not, just as he likes--it is a gloriousliberty! Let any man think for five minutes of what old maidenhood meansto a woman--and then let him be silent. Is it easy to bear through lifea name that in itself signifies defeat? to dwell, as nine out of tenunmarried women must, under the finger of another woman? Is it easy tolook forward to an old age without honour, without the reward of usefullabour, without love? I wonder how many men there are who would give upeverything that is dear in life for the sake of maintaining a high idealpurity."She laughed a little laugh that was clear without being pleasant."And then, when they have no other argument against us, they say, 'Goon; but when you have made woman what you wish, and her children inherither culture, you will defeat yourself. Man will gradually become extinctfrom excess of intellect, the passions which replenish the race willdie.' Fools!" she said, curling her pretty lip. "A Hottentot sits at theroadside and feeds on a rotten bone he has found there, and takes outhis bottle of Cape-smoke and swills at it, and grunts with satisfaction;and the cultured child of the nineteenth century sits in his armchair,and sips choice wines with the lip of a connoisseur, and tastes delicatedishes with a delicate palate, and with a satisfaction of which theHottentot knows nothing. Heavy jaw and sloping forehead--all havegone with increasing intellect; but the animal appetites are therestill--refined, discriminative, but immeasurably intensified. Fools!Before men forgave or worshipped, while they were weak on their hindlegs, did they not eat and drink, and fight for wives? When all thelatter additions to humanity have vanished, will not the foundation onwhich they are built remain?"She was silent then for a while, and said somewhat dreamily, more asthough speaking to herself than to him,"They ask, What will you gain, even if man does not become extinct?--youwill have brought justice and equality on to the earth, and sent lovefrom it. When men and women are equals they will love no more. Yourhighly-cultured women will not be lovable, will not love."Do they see nothing, understand nothing? It is Tant Sannie who burieshusbands one after another, and folds her hands resignedly,--'The Lordgave, and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of theLord,'--and she looks for another. It is the hard-headed, deep thinkerwho, when the wife who has thought and worked with him goes, can find norest, and lingers near her till he finds sleep beside her."A great soul draws and is drawn with a more fierce intensity than anysmall one. By every inch we grow in intellectual height our love strikesdown its roots deeper, and spreads out its arms wider. It is for love'ssake yet more than for any other that we look for that new time."She had leaned her head against the stones, and watched with her sad,soft eyes the retreating bird. "Then when that time comes," she saidlowly, "when love is no more bought or sold, when it is not a means ofmaking bread, when each woman's life is filled with earnest, independentlabour, then love will come to her, a strange, sudden sweetness breakingin upon her earnest work; not sought for, but found. Then, but notnow--"Waldo waited for her to finish the sentence, but she seemed to haveforgotten him."Lyndall," he said, putting his hand upon her--she started--"if youthink that that new time will be so great, so good, you who speak soeasily--"She interrupted him."Speak! speak!" she said, "the difficulty is not to speak; thedifficulty is to keep silence.""But why do you not try to bring that time?" he said with pitifulsimplicity. "When you speak I believe all you say; other people wouldlisten to you also.""I am not so sure of that," she said with a smile.Then over the small face came the weary look it had worn last night asit watched the shadow in the corner, Ah, so weary!"I, Waldo, I?" she said. "I will do nothing good for myself, nothingfor the world, till some one wakes me. I am asleep, swathed, shut up inself; till I have been delivered I will deliver no one."He looked at her wondering, but she was not looking at him."To see the good and the beautiful," she said, "and to have no strengthto live it, is only to be Moses on the mountain of Nebo, with the landat your feet and no power to enter. It would be better not to seeit. Come," she said, looking up into his face, and seeing itsuncomprehending expression, "let us go, it is getting late. Doss isanxious for his breakfast also," she added, wheeling round and callingto the dog, who was endeavouring to unearth a mole, an occupation towhich he had been zealously addicted from the third month, but in whichhe had never on any single occasion proved successful.Waldo shouldered his bag, and Lyndall walked on before in silence, withthe dog close to her side. Perhaps she thought of the narrowness ofthe limits within which a human soul may speak and be understood by itsnearest of mental kin, of how soon it reaches that solitary land ofthe individual experience, in which no fellow footfall is ever heard.Whatever her thoughts may have been, she was soon interrupted. Waldocame close to her, and standing still, produced with awkwardness fromhis breast-pocket a small carved box."I made it for you," he said, holding it out."I like it," she said, examining it carefully.The workmanship was better than that of the grave-post. The flowers thatcovered it were delicate, and here and there small conical protuberanceswere let in among them. She turned it round critically. Waldo bent overit lovingly."There is one strange thing about it," he said earnestly, putting afinger on one little pyramid. "I made it without these, and I feltsomething was wrong; I tried many changes, and at last I let thesein, and then it was right. But why was it? They are not beautiful inthemselves.""They relieve the monotony of the smooth leaves, I suppose."He shook his head as over a weighty matter."The sky is monotonous," he said, "when it is blue, and yet it isbeautiful. I have thought of that often; but it is not monotony, andit is not variety makes beauty. What is it? The sky, and your face, andthis box--the same thing is in them all, only more in the sky and inyour face. But what is it?"She smiled."So you are at your old work still. Why, why, why? What is the reason?It is enough for me," she said, "if I find out what is beautiful andwhat is ugly, what is real and what is not. Why it is there, and overthe final cause of things in general, I don't trouble myself; there mustbe one, but what is it to me? If I howl to all eternity I shall neverget hold of it; and if I did I might be no better off. But you Germansare born with an aptitude for borrowing; you can't help yourselves. Youmust sniff after reasons, just as that dog must after a mole. He knowsperfectly well he will never catch it, but he's under the imperativenecessity of digging for it.""But he might find it.""Might!--but he never has and never will. Life is too short to run aftermights; we must have certainties."She tucked the box under her arm and was about to walk on, whenGregory Rose, with shining spurs, an ostrich feather in his hat, anda silver-headed whip, careered past. He bowed gallantly as he went by.They waited till the dust of the horse's hoofs had laid itself."There," said Lyndall, "goes a true woman--one born for the sphere thatsome women have to fill without being born for it. How happy he wouldbe sewing frills into his little girl's frocks, and how pretty he wouldlook sitting in a parlour, with a rough man making love to him! Don'tyou think so?""I shall not stay here when he is master," Waldo answered, not able toconnect any kind of beauty with Gregory Rose."I should imagine not. The rule of a woman is tyranny; but the rule of aman-woman grinds fine. Where are you going?""Anywhere.""What to do?""See--see everything.""You will be disappointed.""And were you?""Yes; and you will be more so. I want things that men and the worldgive, you do not. If you have a few yards of earth to stand on, and abit of blue over you, and something that you cannot see to dream about,you have all that you need, all that you know how to use. But I like tosee real men. Let them be as disagreeable as they please, they are moreinteresting to me than flowers, or trees, or stars, or any other thingunder the sun. Sometimes," she added, walking on, and shaking the dustdaintily from her skirts, "when I am not too busy trying to find a newway of doing my hair that will show my little neck to better advantage,or over other work of that kind, sometimes it amuses me intensely totrace out the resemblance between one man and another: to see howTant Sannie and I, you and Bonaparte, St. Simon on his pillow, and theemperor dining off larks' tongues, are one and the same compound, merelymixed in different proportions."What is microscopic in one is largely developed in another; what is arudimentary in one man is an active organ in another; but all things arein all men, and one soul is the model of all. We shall find nothing newin human nature after we have once carefully dissected and analyzed theone being we ever shall truly know--ourself. The Kaffer girl threwsome coffee on my arm in bed this morning; I felt displeased, but saidnothing. Tant Sannie would have thrown the saucer at her and sworn foran hour; but the feeling would be the same irritated displeasure. If ahuge animated stomach like Bonaparte were put under a glass by askilful mental microscopist, even he would be found to have an embryonicdoubling somewhere indicative of a heart, and rudimentary buddings thatmight have become conscience and sincerity. Let me take your arm Waldo."How full you are of mealie dust. No, never mind. It will brush off. Andsometimes what is more amusing still than tracing the likeness betweenman and man, is to trace the analogy there always is between theprogress and development of one individual and of a whole nation; or,again, between a single nation and the entire human race. It is pleasantwhen it dawns on you that the one is just the other written out in largeletters; and very odd to find all the little follies and virtues, anddevelopments and retrogressions, written out in the big world's bookthat you find in your little internal self. It is the most amusing thingI know of; but of course, being a woman, I have not often time for suchamusements. Professional duties always first, you know. It takes a greatdeal of time and thought always to look perfectly exquisite, even for apretty woman. Is the old buggy still in existence, Waldo?""Yes, but the harness is broken.""Well, I wish you would mend it. You must teach me to drive. I mustlearn something while I am here. I got the Hottentot girl to show me howto make sarsarties this morning; and Tant Sannie is going to teach me tomake kapjes. I will come and sit with you this afternoon while you mendthe harness.""Thank you.""No, don't thank me; I come for my own pleasure. I never find any oneI can talk to. Women bore me, and men, I talk so to--'Going to the ballthis evening? Nice little dog that of yours. Pretty little ears. So fondof pointer pups!' And they think me fascinating, charming! Men are likethe earth, and we are the moon; we turn always one side to them, andthey think there is no other, because they don't see it--but there is."They had reached the house now."Tell me when you set to work," she said, and walked toward the door.Waldo stood to look after her, and Doss stood at his side, a look ofpainful uncertainty depicted on his small countenance, and one littlefoot poised in the air. Should he stay with his master or go? He lookedat the figure with the wide straw hat moving toward the house, and helooked up at his master; then he put down the little paw and went. Waldowatched them both in at the door and then walked away alone. He wassatisfied that at least his dog was with her.Chapter 2.V. Tant Sannie Holds An Upsitting, and Gregory Writes ALetter.It was just after sunset, and Lyndall had not yet returned from herfirst driving-lesson, when the lean coloured woman standing at thecorner of the house to enjoy the evening breeze, saw coming along theroad a strange horseman. Very narrowly she surveyed him, as slowly heapproached. He was attired in the deepest mourning, the black creperound his tall hat totally concealing the black felt, and nothing but adazzling shirt-front relieving the funereal tone of his attire. He rodemuch forward in his saddle, with his chin resting on the uppermost ofhis shirt-studs, and there was an air of meek subjection to the will ofHeaven, and to what might be in store for him, that bespoke itself evenin the way in which he gently urged his steed. He was evidently in nohurry to reach his destination, for the nearer he approached to it theslacker did his bridle hang. The coloured woman having duly inspectedhim, dashed into the dwelling."Here is another one!" she cried--"a widower; I see it by his hat.""Good Lord!" said Tant Sannie; "it's the seventh I've had this month;but the men know where sheep and good looks and money in the bank are tobe found," she added, winking knowingly. "How does he look?""Nineteen, weak eyes, white hair, little round nose," said the maid."Then it's he! then it's he!" said Tant Sannie triumphantly; "littlePiet Vander Walt, whose wife died last month--two farms, twelve thousandsheep. I've not seen him, but my sister-in-law told me about him, and Idreamed about him last night."Here Piet's black hat appeared in the doorway, and the Boer-woman drewherself up in dignified silence, extended the tips of her fingers, andmotioned solemnly to a chair. The young man seated himself, sticking hisfeet as far under it as they would go, and said mildly:"I am Little Piet Vander Walt, and my father is Big Piet Vander Walt."Tant Sannie said solemnly: "Yes.""Aunt," said the young man, starting up spasmodically; "can Ioff-saddle?""Yes."He seized his hat, and disappeared with a rush through the door."I told you so! I knew it!" said Tant Sannie. "The dear Lord doesn'tsend dreams for nothing. Didn't I tell you this morning that I dreamedof a great beast like a sheep, with red eyes, and I killed it? Wasn'tthe white wool his hair, and the red eyes his weak eyes, and my killinghim meant marriage? Get supper ready quickly; the sheep's inside androaster-cakes. We shall sit up tonight."To young Piet Vander Walt that supper was a period of intense torture.There was something overawing in that assembly of English people, withtheir incomprehensible speech; and moreover, it was his first courtship;his first wife had courted him, and ten months of severe domestic rulehad not raised his spirit nor courage. He ate little, and when heraised a morsel to his lips glanced guiltily round to see if he werenot observed. He had put three rings on his little finger, with theintention of sticking it out stiffly when he raised a coffee-cup; nowthe little finger was curled miserably among its fellows. It was smallrelief when the meal was over, and Tant Sannie and he repaired to thefront room. Once seated there, he set his knees close together, stoodhis black hat upon them, and wretchedly turned the brim up and down.But supper had cheered Tant Sannie, who found it impossible longer tomaintain that decorous silence, and whose heart yearned over the youth."I was related to your aunt Selena who died," said Tant Sannie. "Mymother's stepbrother's child was married to her father's brother'sstepnephew's niece.""Yes, aunt," said the young man, "I know we were related.""It was her cousin," said Tant Sannie, now fairly on the flow, "who hadthe cancer cut out of her breast by the other doctor, who was not theright doctor they sent for, but who did it quite as well.""Yes, aunt," said the young man."I've heard about it often," said Tant Sannie. "And he was the son ofthe old doctor that they say died on Christmas-day, but I don't knowif that's true. People do tell such awful lies. Why should he die onChristmas-day more than any other day?""Yes, aunt, why?" said the young man meekly."Did you ever have the toothache?" asked Tant Sannie."No, aunt.""Well, they say that doctor--not the son of the old doctor that died onChristmas-day, the other that didn't come when he was sent for--he gavesuch good stuff for the toothache that if you opened the bottle in theroom where any one was bad they got better directly. You could see itwas good stuff," said Tant Sannie; "it tasted horrid. That was a realdoctor! He used to give a bottle so high," said the Boer-woman, raisingher hand a foot from the table, "you could drink at it for a month andit wouldn't get done, and the same medicine was good for all sorts ofsicknesses--croup, measles, jaundice, dropsy. Now you have to buy a newkind for each sickness. The doctors aren't so good as they used to be.""No, aunt," said the young man, who was trying to gain courage to stickout his legs and clink his spurs together. He did so at last.Tant Sannie had noticed the spurs before; but she thought it showed anice manly spirit, and her heart warmed yet more to the youth."Did you ever have convulsions when you were a baby?" asked Tant Sannie."Yes," said the young man."Strange," said Tant Sannie; "I had convulsions too. Wonderful that weshould be so much alike!""Aunt," said the young man explosively, "can we sit up tonight?"Tant Sannie hung her head and half closed her eyes; but finding that herlittle wiles were thrown away, the young man staring fixedly at his hat,she simpered, "Yes," and went away to fetch candles.In the dining room Em worked at her machine, and Gregory sat closebeside her, his great blue eyes turned to the window where Lyndallleaned out talking to Waldo.Tant Sannie took two candles out of the cupboard and held them uptriumphantly, winking all round the room."He's asked for them," she said."Does he want them for his horse's rubbed back?" asked Gregory, new toup-country life."No," said Tant Sannie, indignantly; "we're going to sit up!" and shewalked off in triumph with the candles.Nevertheless, when all the rest of the house had retired, when the longcandle was lighted, when the coffee-kettle was filled, when she sat inthe elbow-chair, with her lover on a chair close beside her, and whenthe vigil of the night was fairly begun, she began to find it wearisome.The young man looked chilly, and said nothing."Won't you put your feet on my stove?" said Tant Sannie."No thank you, aunt," said the young man, and both lapsed into silence.At last Tant Sannie, afraid of going to sleep, tapped a strong cup ofcoffee for herself and handed another to her lover. This visibly revivedboth."How long were you married, cousin?""Ten months, aunt.""How old was your baby?""Three days when it died.""It's very hard when we must give our husbands and wives to the Lord,"said Tant Sannie."Very," said the young man; "but it's the Lord's will.""Yes," said Tant Sannie, and sighed."She was such a good wife, aunt: I've known her break a churn-stick overa maid's head for only letting dust come on a milk cloth."Tant Sannie felt a twinge of jealousy. She had never broken achurn-stick on a maid's head."I hope your wife made a good end," she said."Oh, beautiful, aunt: she said up a psalm and two hymns and a halfbefore she died.""Did she leave any messages?" asked Tant Sannie."No," said the young man; "but the night before she died I was lying atthe foot of her bed; I felt her foot kick me."'Piet,' she said."'Annie, my heart,' said I."'My little baby that died yesterday has been here, and it stood overthe wagon-box,' she said."'What did it say?' I asked."'It said that if I died you must marry a fat woman.'"'I will,' I said, and I went to sleep again. Presently she woke me."'The little baby has been here again, and it says you must marry awoman over thirty, and who's had two husbands.'"I didn't go to sleep after that for a long time, aunt; but when I didshe woke me."'The baby has been here again,' she said, 'and it says you mustn'tmarry a woman with a mole.' I told her I wouldn't; and the next day shedied.""That was a vision from the Redeemer," said Tant Sannie.The young man nodded his head mournfully. He thought of a younger sisterof his wife's who was not fat, and who had a mole, and of whom his wifehad always been jealous, and he wished the little baby had liked betterstaying in heaven than coming and standing over the wagon-chest."I suppose that's why you came to me," said Tant Sannie."Yes, aunt. And pa said I ought to get married before shearing-time. Itis bad if there's no one to see after things then; and the maids wastesuch a lot of fat.""When do you want to get married?""Next month, aunt," said the young man in a tone of hopelessresignation. "May I kiss you, aunt?""Fie! fie!" said Tant Sannie, and then gave him a resounding kiss."Come, draw your chair a little closer," she said, and their elbows nowtouching, they sat on through the night.The next morning at dawn, as Em passed through Tant Sannie's bedroom,she found the Boer-woman pulling off her boots preparatory to climbinginto bed."Where is Piet Vander Walt?""Just gone," said Tant Sannie; "and I am going to marry him this dayfour weeks. I am dead sleepy," she added; "the stupid thing doesn't knowhow to talk love-talk at all," and she climbed into the four-poster,clothes and all, and drew the quilt up to her chin.*****On the day preceding Tant Sannie's wedding, Gregory Rose sat in theblazing sun on the stone wall behind his daub-and-wattle house. Itwas warm, but he was intently watching a small buggy that was beingrecklessly driven over the bushes in the direction of the farmhouse.Gregory never stirred till it had vanished; then, finding the stoneshot, he slipped down and walked into the house. He kicked the littlepail that lay in the doorway, and sent it into one corner; that did himgood. Then he sat down on the box, and began cutting letters out of apiece of newspaper. Finding that the snippings littered the floor, hepicked them up and began scribbling on his blotting-paper. He tried theeffect of different initials before the name Rose: G. Rose, E. Rose, L.Rose, Rose, L.L., L.L. Rose. When he had covered the sheet, he looked atit discontentedly a little while, then suddenly began to write a letter:"Beloved Sister,"It is a long while since I last wrote to you, but I have had no time.This is the first morning I have been at home since I don't know when.Em always expects me to go down to the farmhouse in the morning; but Ididn't feel as though I could stand the ride today."I have much news for you."Tant Sannie, Em's Boer stepmother, is to be married tomorrow. She isgone to town today, and the wedding feast is to be at her brother'sfarm. Em and I are going to ride over on horseback, but her cousin isgoing to ride in the buggy with that German. I don't think I've writtento you since she came back from school. I don't think you would like herat all, Jemima; there's something so proud about her. She thinks justbecause she's handsome there's nobody good enough to talk to her, andjust as if there had nobody else but her been to boarding-school before."They are going to have a grand affair tomorrow; all the Boers about arecoming, and they are going to dance all night; but I don't think Ishall dance at all; for, as Em's cousin says, these Boer dances are lowthings. I am sure I only danced at the last to please Em. I don't knowwhy she is fond of dancing. Em talked of our being married on the sameday as Tant Sannie; but I said it would be nicer for her if she waitedtill the shearing was over, and I took her down to see you. I supposeshe will have to live with us (Em's cousin, I mean), as she has notanything in the world but a poor fifty pounds. I don't like her at all,Jemima, and I don't think you would. She's got such queer ways; she'salways driving about in a gig with that low German; and I don't thinkit's at all the thing for a woman to be going about with a man she'snot engaged to. Do you? If it was me now, of course, who am a kind ofconnection, it would be different. The way she treats me, consideringthat I am so soon to be her cousin, is not at all nice. I took down myalbum the other day with your likenesses in it, and I told her she couldlook at it, and put it down close to her; but she just said, Thank you,and never even touched it, as much as to say--What are your relations tome?"She gets the wildest horses in that buggy, and a horrid snappish littlecur belonging to the German sitting in front, and then she drives outalone. I don't think it's at all proper for a woman to drive out alone;I wouldn't allow it if she was my sister. The other morning, I don'tknow how it happened, I was going in the way from which she was coming,and that little beast--they call him Doss--began to bark when he sawme--he always does, the little wretch--and the horses began to spring,and kicked the splashboard all to pieces. It was a sight to see Jemima!She has got the littlest hands I ever saw--I could hold them both inone of mine, and not know that I'd got anything except that they wereso soft; but she held those horses in as though they were made of iron.When I wanted to help her she said, 'No thank you: I can manage themmyself. I've got a pair of bits that would break their jaws if I usedthem well,' and she laughed and drove away. It's so unwomanly."Tell father my hire of the ground will not be out for six months, andbefore that Em and I will be married. My pair of birds is breeding now,but I haven't been down to see them for three days. I don't seem to careabout anything any more. I don't know what it is; I'm not well. If Igo into town on Saturday I will let the doctor examine me; but perhapsshe'll go in herself. It's a very strange thing, Jemima, but she neverwill send her letters to post by me. If I ask her she has none, andthe very next day she goes in and posts them herself. You mustn't sayanything about it, Jemima, but twice I've brought her letters from thepost in a gentleman's hand, and I'm sure they were both from the sameperson, because I noticed every little mark, even the dotting of thei's."Of course it's nothing to me; but for Em's sake I can't help feeling aninterest in her, however much I may dislike her myself; and I hope she'sup to nothing. I pity the man who marries her; I wouldn't be him foranything. If I had a wife with pride I'd make her give it up, sharp. Idon't believe in a man who can't make a woman obey him. Now Em--I'm veryfond of her, as you know--but if I tell her to put on a certain dress,that dress she puts on; and if I tell her to sit on a certain seat,on that seat she sits; and if I tell her not to speak to a certainindividual, she does not speak to them. If a man lets a woman do what hedoesn't like he's a muff."Give my love to mother and the children. The veld here is lookingpretty good, and the sheep are better since we washed them. Tell fatherthe dip he recommended is very good."Em sends her love to you. She is making me some woollen shirts; butthey don't fit me so nicely as those mother made me."Write soon to"Your loving brother, Gregory."P.S.--She drove past just now; I was sitting on the kraal wall rightbefore her eyes, and she never even bowed. G.N.R."Chapter 2.VI. A Boer-wedding."I didn't know before you were so fond of riding hard," said Gregory tohis little betrothed.They were cantering slowly on the road to Oom Muller's on the morning ofthe wedding."Do you call this riding hard?" asked Em in some astonishment."Of course I do! It's enough to break the horses' necks, and knock oneup for the whole day besides," he added testily; then twisted his headto look at the buggy that came on behind. "I thought Waldo was such amad driver; they are taking it easily enough today," said Gregory. "Onewould think the black stallions were lame.""I suppose they want to keep out of our dust," said Em. "See, they standstill as soon as we do."Perceiving this to be the case, Gregory rode on."It's all that horse of yours: she kicks up such a confounded dust, Ican't stand it myself," he said.Meanwhile the cart came on slowly enough."Take the reins," said Lyndall, and "and make them walk. I want to restand watch their hoofs today--not to be exhilarated; I am so tired."She leaned back in her corner, and Waldo drove on slowly in the greydawn light along the level road. They passed the very milk-bush behindwhich so many years before the old German had found the Kaffer woman.But their thoughts were not with him that morning: they were thethoughts of the young, that run out to meet the future, and labour inthe present. At last he touched her arm."What is it?""I feared you had gone to sleep and might be jolted out," he said; "yousat so quietly.""No; do not talk to me; I am not asleep;" but after a time she saidsuddenly: "It must be a terrible thing to bring a human being into theworld."Waldo looked round; she sat drawn into the corner, her blue cloud woundtightly about her, and she still watched the horses' feet. Having nocomment to offer on her somewhat unexpected remark, he merely touched uphis horses."I have no conscience, none," she added; "but I would not like to bringa soul into this world. When it sinned and when it suffered somethinglike a dead hand would fall on me--'You did it, you, for your ownpleasure you created this thing! See your work!' If it lived to beeighty it would always hang like a millstone round my neck, have theright to demand good from me, and curse me for its sorrow. A parent isonly like to God--if his work turns out bad, so much the worse for him;he dare not wash his hands of it. Time and years can never bring the daywhen you can say to your child: 'Soul, what have I to do with you?'"Waldo said dreamingly:"It is a marvellous thing that one soul should have power to causeanother."She heard the words as she heard the beating of the horses' hoofs; herthoughts ran on in their own line."They say, 'God sends the little babies.' Of all the dastardly revoltinglies men tell to suit themselves, I hate that most. I suppose my fathersaid so when he knew he was dying of consumption, and my mother when sheknew she had nothing to support me on, and they created me to feed likea dog from stranger hands. Men do not say God sends the books, or thenewspaper articles, or the machines they make; and then sigh, and shrugtheir shoulders and say they can't help it. Why do they say so aboutother things? Liars! 'God sends the little babies!'" She struck her footfretfully against the splashboard. "The small children say so earnestly.They touch the little stranger reverently who has just come from God'sfar country, and they peep about the room to see if not one whitefeather has dropped from the wing of the angel that brought him. Ontheir lips the phrase means much; on all others it is a deliberate lie.Noticeable, too," she said, dropping in an instant from the passionateinto a low, mocking tone, "when people are married, though they shouldhave sixty children, they throw the whole onus on God. When they arenot, we hear nothing about God's having sent them. When there has beenno legal contract between the parents, who sends the little childrenthen? The devil perhaps!" She laughed her little silvery, mocking laugh."Odd that some men should come from hell and some from heaven, and yetall look so much alike when they get here."Waldo wondered at her. He had not the key to her thoughts, and did notsee the string on which they were strung. She drew her cloud tighterabout her."It must be very nice to believe in the devil," she said; "I wish I did.If it would be of any use I would pray three hours night and morning onmy bare knees, 'God, let me believe in Satan.' He is so useful to thosepeople who do. They may be as selfish and as sensual as they please,and, between God's will and the devil's action, always have some oneto throw their sin on. But we, wretched unbelievers, we bear ourown burdens: we must say, 'I myself did it, I. Not God, not Satan; Imyself!' That is the sting that strikes deep. Waldo," she said gently,with a sudden and complete change of manner, "I like you so much, I loveyou." She rested her cheek softly against his shoulder. "When I am withyou I never know that I am a woman and you are a man; I only know thatwe are both things that think. Other men when I am with them, whetherI love them or not, they are mere bodies to me; but you are a spirit; Ilike you. Look," she said quickly, sinking back into her corner, "whata pretty pinkness there is on all the hilltops! The sun will rise in amoment."Waldo lifted his eyes to look round over the circle of golden hills; andthe horses, as the first sunbeams touched them, shook their heads andchamped their bright bits, till the brass settings in their harnessglittered again.It was eight o'clock when they neared the farmhouse: a red-brickbuilding, with kraals to the right and a small orchard to the left.Already there were signs of unusual life and bustle: one cart, a wagon,and a couple of saddles against the wall betokened the arrival of a fewearly guests, whose numbers would soon be largely increased. To a Dutchcountry wedding guests start up in numbers astonishing to one who hasmerely ridden through the plains of sparsely-inhabited karoo.As the morning advances, riders on many shades of steeds appear from alldirections, and add their saddles to the long rows against the walls,shake hands, drink coffee, and stand about outside in groups to watchthe arriving carts and ox-wagons, as they are unburdened of their heavyfreight of massive Tantes and comely daughters, followed by swarms ofchildren of all sizes, dressed in all manner of print and moleskin, whoare taken care of by Hottentot, Kaffer, and half-caste nurses, whosemany-shaded complexions, ranging from light yellow up to ebony black,add variety to the animated scene.Everywhere is excitement and bustle, which gradually increases as thetime for the return of the wedding-party approaches. Preparations forthe feast are actively advancing in the kitchen; coffee is liberallyhanded round, and amid a profound sensation, and the firing of guns,the horse-wagon draws up, and the wedding-party alight. Brideand bridegroom, with their attendants, march solemnly to themarriage-chamber, where bed and box are decked out in white, with endsof ribbon and artificial flowers, and where on a row of chairs the partysolemnly seat themselves. After a time bridesmaid and best man rise, andconduct in with ceremony each individual guest, to wish success and tokiss bride and bridegroom.Then the feast is set on the table, and it is almost sunset before thedishes are cleared away, and the pleasure of the day begins. Everythingis removed from the great front room, and the mud floor, well rubbedwith bullock's blood, glistens like polished mahogany. The femaleportion of the assembly flock into the side-rooms to attire themselvesfor the evening; and re-issue clad in white muslin, and gay with brightribbons and brass jewelry. The dancing begins as the first tallowcandles are stuck up about the walls, the music coming from a couple offiddlers in a corner of the room. Bride and bridegroom open the ball,and the floor is soon covered with whirling couples, and every one'sspirits rise. The bridal pair mingle freely in the throng, and here andthere a musical man sings vigorously as he drags his partner through theBlue Water or John Speriwig; boys shout and applaud, and the enjoymentand confusion are intense, till eleven o'clock comes. By this time thechildren who swarm in the side-rooms are not to be kept quiet longer,even by hunches of bread and cake; there is a general howl and wail,that rises yet higher than the scraping of fiddles, and mothers rushfrom their partners to knock small heads together, and cuff littlenursemaids, and force the wailers down into unoccupied corners of beds,under tables and behind boxes. In half an hour every variety of childishsnore is heard on all sides, and it has become perilous to raise or setdown a foot in any of the side-rooms lest a small head or hand should becrushed.Now too the busy feet have broken the solid coating of the floor, and acloud of fine dust arises, that makes a yellow halo round the candles,and sets asthmatic people coughing, and grows denser, till to recogniseany one on the opposite side of the room becomes impossible, and apartner's face is seen through a yellow mist.At twelve o'clock the bride is led to the marriage-chamber andundressed; the lights are blown out, and the bridegroom is brought tothe door by the best man, who gives him the key; then the door is shutand locked, and the revels rise higher than ever. There is no thought ofsleep till morning, and no unoccupied spot where sleep may be found.It was at this stage of the proceedings on the night of Tant Sannie'swedding that Lyndall sat near the doorway in one of the side-rooms, towatch the dancers as they appeared and disappeared in the yellow cloudof dust. Gregory sat moodily in a corner of the large dancing-room. Hislittle betrothed touched his arm."I wish you would go and ask Lyndall to dance with you," she said; "shemust be so tired; she has sat still the whole evening.""I have asked her three times," replied her lover shortly. "I'm notgoing to be her dog, and creep to her feet, just to give her thepleasure of kicking me--not for you, Em, nor for anybody else.""Oh, I didn't know you had asked her, Greg," said his little betrothed,humbly; and she went away to pour out coffee.Nevertheless, some time after Gregory found he had shifted so far roundthe room as to be close to the door where Lyndall sat. After standingfor some time he inquired whether he might not bring her a cup ofcoffee.She declined; but still he stood on (why should he not stand there aswell as anywhere else?), and then he stepped into the bedroom."May I not bring you a stove, Miss Lyndall, to put your feet on?""Thank you."He sought for one, and put it under her feet."There is a draught from that broken window: shall I stuff something inthe pane?""No, we want air."Gregory looked round, but nothing else suggesting itself, he sat down ona box on the opposite side of the door. Lyndall sat before him, her chinresting in her hand; her eyes, steel-grey by day, but black by night,looked through the doorway into the next room. After a time he thoughtshe had entirely forgotten his proximity, and he dared to inspect thelittle hands and neck as he never dared when he was in momentary dreadof the eyes being turned upon him.She was dressed in black, which seemed to take her yet further from thewhite-clad, gewgawed women about her; and the little hands were white,and the diamond ring glittered. Where had she got that ring? He bentforward a little and tried to decipher the letters, but the candle-lightwas too faint. When he looked up her eyes were fixed on him. She waslooking at him--not, Gregory felt, as she had ever looked at him before;not as though he were a stump or a stone that chance had thrown in herway. Tonight, whether it were critically, or kindly, or unkindly, hecould not tell, but she looked at him, at the man, Gregory Rose, withattention. A vague elation filled him. He clinched his fist tightto think of some good idea he might express to her; but of all thoseprofound things he had pictured himself as saying to her, when he satalone in the daub-and-wattle house, not one came. He said, at last:"These Boer dances are very low things;" and then, as soon as it hadgone from him, he thought it was not a clever remark, and wished itback.Before Lyndall replied Em looked in at the door."Oh, come," she said; "they are going to have the cushion-dance. I donot want to kiss any of these fellows. Take me quickly."She slipped her hand into Gregory's arm."It is so dusty, Em; do you care to dance any more?" he asked, withoutrising."Oh, I do not mind the dust, and the dancing rests me."But he did not move."I feel tired; I do not think I shall dance again," he said.Em withdrew her hand, and a young farmer came to the door and bore heroff."I have often imagined," remarked Gregory--but Lyndall had risen."I am tired," she said. "I wonder where Waldo is; he must take me home.These people will not leave off till morning, I suppose; it is threealready."She made her way past the fiddlers, and a bench full of tired dancers,and passed out at the front door. On the stoep a group of men and boyswere smoking, peeping in at the windows, and cracking coarse jokes.Waldo was certainly not among them, and she made her way to the cartsand wagons drawn up at some distance from the homestead."Waldo," she said, peering into a large cart, "is that you? I am sodazed with the tallow candles, I see nothing."He had made himself a place between the two seats. She climbed up andsat on the sloping floor in front."I thought I should find you here," she said, drawing her skirt up abouther shoulders. "You must take me home presently, but not now."She leaned her head on the seat near to his, and they listened insilence to the fitful twanging of the fiddles as the night-wind bore itfrom the farmhouse, and to the ceaseless thud of the dancers, and thepeals of gross laughter. She stretched out her little hand to feel forhis."It is so nice to lie here and hear that noise," she said. "I like tofeel that strange life beating up against me. I like to realise formsof life utterly unlike mine." She drew a long breath. "When my own lifefeels small, and I am oppressed with it, I like to crush together, andsee it in a picture, in an instant, a multitude of disconnected unlikephases of human life--a mediaeval monk with his string of beads pacingthe quiet orchard, and looking up from the grass at his feet tothe heavy fruit-trees; little Malay boys playing naked on a shiningsea-beach; a Hindoo philosopher alone under his banyan tree, thinking,thinking, thinking, so that in the thought of God he may lose himself;a troop of Bacchanalians dressed in white, with crowns of vine-leaves,dancing along the Roman streets; a martyr on the night of his deathlooking through the narrow window to the sky, and feeling that alreadyhe has the wings that shall bear him up" (she moved her hand dreamilyover her face); "an epicurean discoursing at a Roman bath to a knot ofhis disciples on the nature of happiness; a Kaffer witchdoctor seekingfor herbs by moonlight, while from the huts on the hillside come thesound of dogs barking, and the voices of women and children; a mothergiving bread-and-milk to her children in little wooden basins andsinging the evening song. I like to see it all; I feel it run throughme--that life belongs to me; it makes my little life larger, it breaksdown the narrow walls that shut me in."She sighed, and drew a long breath."Have you made any plans?" she asked him presently."Yes," he said, the words coming in jets, with pauses between; "I willtake the grey mare--I will travel first--I will see the world--then Iwill find work.""What work?""I do not know."She made a little impatient movement."That is no plan; travel--see the world--find work! If you go into theworld aimless, without a definite object, dreaming--dreaming, you willbe definitely defeated, bamboozled, knocked this way and that. In theend you will stand with your beautiful life all spent, and nothing toshow. They talk of genius--it is nothing but this, that a man knowswhat he can do best, and does it, and nothing else. Waldo," she said,knitting her little fingers closer among his, "I wish I could help you;I wish I could make you see that you must decide what you will beand do. It does not matter what you choose--be a farmer, businessman,artist, what you will--but know your aim, and live for that one thing.We have only one life. The secret of success is concentration; whereverthere has been a great life, or a great work, that has gone before.Taste everything a little, look at everything a little; but live forone thing. Anything is possible to a man who knows his end and movesstraight for it, and for it alone. I will show you what I mean," shesaid, concisely; "words are gas till you condense them into pictures.""Suppose a woman, young, friendless as I am, the weakest thing on God'searth. But she must make her way through life. What she would be shecannot be because she is a woman; so she looks carefully at herself andthe world about her, to see where her path must be made."There is no one to help her; she must help herself. She looks. Thesethings she has--a sweet voice, rich in subtile intonations; a fair,very fair face, with a power of concentrating in itself, and givingexpression to, feelings that otherwise must have been dissipated inwords; a rare power of entering into other lives unlike her own, andintuitively reading them aright. These qualities she has. How shall sheuse them? A poet, a writer, needs only the mental; what use has he fora beautiful body that registers clearly mental emotions? And the painterwants an eye for form and colour, and the musician an ear for time andtune, and the mere drudge has no need for mental gifts."But there is one art in which all she has would be used, for which theyare all necessary--the delicate expressive body, the rich voice, thepower of mental transposition. The actor, who absorbs and then reflectsfrom himself other human lives, needs them all, but needs not muchmore. This is her end; but how to reach it? Before her are endlessdifficulties: seas must be crossed, poverty must be endured, loneliness,want. She must be content to wait long before she can even get her feetupon the path. If she has made blunders in the past, if she has weightedherself with a burden which she must bear to the end, she must butbear the burden bravely, and labour on. There is no use in wailing andrepentance here: the next world is the place for that; this life is tooshort. By our errors we see deeper into life. They help us." She waitedfor a while. "If she does all this--if she waits patiently, if she isnever cast down, never despairs, never forgets her end, moves straighttoward it, bending men and things most unlikely to her purpose--she mustsucceed at last. Men and things are plastic; they part to the right andleft when one comes among them moving in a straight line to one end.I know it by my own little experience," she said. "Long years ago Iresolved to be sent to school. It seemed a thing utterly out of mypower; but I waited, I watched, I collected clothes, I wrote, took myplace at the school; when all was ready I bore with my full force on theBoer-woman, and she sent me at last. It was a small thing; but life ismade up of small things, as a body is built up of cells. What has beendone in small things can be done in large. Shall be," she said softly.Waldo listened. To him the words were no confession, no glimpse into thestrong, proud, restless heart of the woman. They were general words witha general application. He looked up into the sparkling sky with dulleyes."Yes," he said; "but when we lie and think, and think, we see that thereis nothing worth doing. The universe is so large, and man is so small--"She shook her head quickly."But we must not think so far; it is madness, it is a disease. We knowthat no man's work is great, and stands forever. Moses is dead, and theprophets and the books that our grandmothers fed on the mould is eating.Your poet and painter and actor,--before the shouts that applaud themhave died their names grow strange, they are milestones that the worldhas passed. Men have set their mark on mankind forever, as theythought; but time has washed it out as it has washed out mountains andcontinents." She raised herself on her elbow. "And what if we could helpmankind, and leave the traces of our work upon it to the end? Mankind isonly an ephemeral blossom on the tree of time; there were others beforeit opened; there will be others after it has fallen. Where was man inthe time of the dicynodont, and when hoary monsters wallowed in the mud?Will he be found in the aeons that are to come? We are sparks, we areshadows, we are pollen, which the next wind will carry away. We aredying already; it is all a dream."I know that thought. When the fever of living is on us, when thedesire to become, to know, to do, is driving us mad, we can use it asan anodyne, to still the fever and cool our beating pulses. But it is apoison, not a food. If we live on it it will turn our blood to ice;we might as well be dead. We must not, Waldo; I want your life to bebeautiful, to end in something. You are nobler and stronger than I," shesaid; "and as much better as one of God's great angels is better than asinning man. Your life must go for something.""Yes, we will work," he said.She moved closer to him and lay still, his black curls touching hersmooth little head.Doss, who had lain at his master's side, climbed over the bench, andcurled himself up in her lap. She drew her skirt up over him, and thethree sat motionless for a long time."Waldo," she said, suddenly, "they are laughing at us.""Who?" he asked, starting up."They--the stars!" she said, softly. "Do you not see? There is a littlewhite, mocking finger pointing down at us from each one of them! We aretalking of tomorrow and tomorrow, and our hearts are so strong; we arenot thinking of something that can touch us softly in the dark and makeus still forever. They are laughing at us Waldo."Both sat looking upward."Do you ever pray?" he asked her in a low voice."No.""I never do; but I might when I look up there. I will tell you," headded, in a still lower voice, "where I could pray. If there were a wallof rock on the edge of a world, and one rock stretched out far, far intospace, and I stood alone upon it, alone, with stars above me, and starsbelow me,--I would not say anything; but the feeling would be prayer."There was an end to their conversation after that, and Doss fell asleepon her knee. At last the night-wind grew very chilly."Ah," she said, shivering, and drawing the skirt about her shoulders, "Iam cold. Span-in the horses, and call me when you are ready."She slipped down and walked toward the house, Doss stiffly followingher, not pleased at being roused. At the door she met Gregory."I have been looking for you everywhere; may I not drive you home?" hesaid."Waldo drives me," she replied, passing on; and it appeared to Gregorythat she looked at him in the old way, without seeing him. But beforeshe had reached the door an idea had occurred to her, for she turned."If you wish to drive me you may."Gregory went to look for Em, whom he found pouring out coffee in theback room. He put his hand quickly on her shoulder."You must ride with Waldo; I am going to drive your cousin home.""But I can't come just now, Greg; I promised Tant Annie Muller to lookafter the things while she went to rest a little.""Well, you can come presently, can't you? I didn't say you were to comenow. I'm sick of this thing," said Gregory, turning sharply on his heel."Why must I sit up the whole night because your stepmother chooses toget married?""Oh, it's all right, Greg, I only meant--"But he did not hear her, and a man had come up to have his cup filled.An hour after Waldo came in to look for her, and found her still busy atthe table."The horses are ready," he said; "but if you would like to have onedance more I will wait."She shook her head wearily."No; I am quite ready. I want to go."And soon they were on the sandy road the buggy had travelled an hourbefore. Their horses, with heads close together, nodding sleepily asthey walked in the starlight, you might have counted the rise and fallof their feet in the sand; and Waldo in his saddle nodded drowsily also.Only Em was awake, and watched the starlit road with wide-open eyes. Atlast she spoke."I wonder if all people feel so old, so very old, when they get to beseventeen?""Not older than before," said Waldo sleepily, pulling at his bridle.Presently she said again:"I wish I could have been a little child always. You are good then. Youare never selfish; you like every one to have everything; but when youare grown up there are some things you like to have all to yourself, youdon't like any one else to have any of them.""Yes," said Waldo sleepily, and she did not speak again.When they reached the farmhouse all was dark, for Lyndall had retired assoon as they got home.Waldo lifted Em from her saddle, and for a moment she leaned her head onhis shoulder and clung to him."You are very tired," he said, as he walked with her to the door; "letme go in and light a candle for you.""No, thank you; it is all right," she said. "Good night, Waldo, dear."But when she went in she sat long alone in the dark.Chapter 2.VII. Waldo Goes Out to Taste Life, and Em Stays At Home andTastes It.At nine o'clock in the evening, packing his bundles for the nextmorning's start, Waldo looked up, and was surprised to see Em's yellowhead peeping in at his door. It was many a month since she had beenthere. She said she had made him sandwiches for his journey, and shestayed a while to help him put his goods into the saddlebags."You can leave the old things lying about," she said; "I will lock theroom, and keep it waiting for you to come back some day."To come back some day! Would the bird ever return to its cage? But hethanked her. When she went away he stood on the doorstep holding thecandle till she had almost reached the house. But Em was that eveningin no hurry to enter, and, instead of going in at the back door, walkedwith lagging footsteps round the low brick wall that ran before thehouse. Opposite the open window of the parlour she stopped. The littleroom, kept carefully closed in Tant Sannie's time, was well lighted by aparaffin lamp; books and work lay strewn about it, and it wore abright, habitable aspect. Beside the lamp at the table in the corner satLyndall, the open letters and papers of the day's post lying scatteredbefore her, while she perused the columns of a newspaper. At the centretable, with his arms folded on an open paper, which there was not lightenough to read, sat Gregory. He was looking at her. The light from theopen window fell on Em's little face under its white kapje as she lookedin, but no one glanced that way."Go and fetch me a glass of water!" Lyndall said, at last.Gregory went out to find it; when he put it down at her side she merelymoved her head in recognition, and he went back to his seat and his oldoccupation. Then Em moved slowly away from the window, and through itcame in spotted, hard-winged insects, to play round the lamp, till, oneby one, they stuck to its glass, and fell to the foot dead.Ten o'clock struck. Then Lyndall rose, gathered up her papers andletters, and wished Gregory good night. Some time after Em entered; shehad been sitting all the while on the loft ladder, and had drawn herkapje down very much over her face.Gregory was piecing together the bits of an envelope when she came in."I thought you were never coming," he said, turning round quickly, andthrowing the fragments onto the floor. "You know I have been shearingall day, and it is ten o'clock already.""I'm sorry. I did not think you would be going so soon," she said in alow voice."I can't hear what you say. What makes you mumble so? Well, good night,Em."He stooped down hastily to kiss her."I want to talk to you, Gregory.""Well, make haste," he said pettishly. "I'm awfully tired. I've beensitting here all the evening. Why couldn't you come and talk before?""I will not keep you long," she answered very steadily now. "I think,Gregory, it would be better if you and I were never to be married.""Good Heaven! Em, what do you mean? I thought you were so fond of me?You always professed to be. What on earth have you taken into your headnow?""I think it would be better," she said, folding her hands over eachother, very much as though she were praying."Better, Em! What do you mean? Even a woman can't take a freak allabout nothing! You must have some reason for it, and I'm sure I've donenothing to offend you. I wrote only today to my sister to tell her tocome up next month to our wedding, and I've been as affectionate andhappy as possible. Come--what's the matter?"He put his arm half round her shoulder, very loosely."I think it would be better," she answered, slowly."Oh, well," he said, drawing himself up, "if you won't enter intoexplanations you won't; and I'm not the man to beg and pray--not to anywoman, and you know that! If you don't want to marry me I can't obligeyou to, of course."She stood quite still before him."You women never do know your own minds for two days together; andof course you know the state of your own feelings best; but it's verystrange. Have you really made up your mind, Em?""Yes.""Well, I'm very sorry. I'm sure I've not been in anything to blame. Aman can't always be billing and cooing; but, as you say, if your feelingfor me has changed, it's much better you shouldn't marry me. There'snothing so foolish as to marry some one you don't love; and I only wishfor your happiness, I'm sure. I daresay you'll find some one can makeyou much happier than I could; the first person we love is seldom theright one. You are very young; it's quite natural you should change."She said nothing."Things often seem hard at the time, but Providence makes them turn outfor the best in the end," said Gregory. "You'll let me kiss you, Em,just for old friendship's sake." He stooped down. "You must look upon meas a dear brother, as a cousin at least; as long as I am on the farm Ishall always be glad to help you, Em."Soon after the brown pony was cantering along the footpath to thedaub-and-wattle house, and his master as he rode whistled John Speriwigand the Thorn Kloof Schottische.The sun had not yet touched the outstretched arms of the prickly pearupon the kopje, and the early cocks and hens still strutted aboutstiffly after the night's roost, when Waldo stood before the wagon-housesaddling the grey mare. Every now and then he glanced up at the oldfamiliar objects: they had a new aspect that morning. Even the cocks,seen in the light of parting, had a peculiar interest, and he listenedwith conscious attention while one crowed clear and loud as it stood onthe pigsty wall. He wished good morning softly to the Kaffer woman whowas coming up from the huts to light the fire. He was leaving them allto that old life, and from his height he looked down on them pityingly.So they would keep on crowing, and coming to light fires, when for himthat old colourless existence was but a dream.He went into the house to say good-bye to Em, and then he walked to thedoor of Lyndall's room to wake her; but she was up, and standing in thedoorway."So you are ready," she said.Waldo looked at her with sudden heaviness; the exhilaration died out ofhis heart. Her grey dressing-gown hung close about her, and below itsedge the little bare feet were resting on the threshold."I wonder when we shall meet again, Waldo? What you will be, and whatI?""Will you write to me?" he asked of her."Yes; and if I should not, you can still remember, wherever you are,that you are not alone.""I have left Doss for you," he said."Will you not miss him?""No; I want you to have him. He loves you better than he loves me.""Thank you." They stood quiet."Good-bye!" she said, putting her little hand in his, and he turnedaway; but when he reached the door she called to him: "Come back, Iwant to kiss you." She drew his face down to hers, and held it with bothhands, and kissed it on the forehead and mouth. "Good-bye, dear!"When he looked back the little figure with its beautiful eyes wasstanding in the doorway still.Chapter 2.VIII. The Kopje."Good morning!"Em, who was in the storeroom measuring the Kaffer's rations, looked upand saw her former lover standing betwixt her and the sunshine. For somedays after that evening on which he had ridden home whistling he hadshunned her. She might wish to enter into explanations, and he, GregoryRose, was not the man for that kind of thing. If a woman had once thrownhim overboard she must take the consequences, and stand by them. When,however, she showed no inclination to revert to the past, and shunnedhim more than he shunned her, Gregory softened."You must let me call you Em still, and be like a brother to you till Igo," he said; and Em thanked him so humbly that he wished she hadn't. Itwasn't so easy after that to think himself an injured man.On that morning he stood some time in the doorway switching his whip,and moving rather restlessly from one leg to the other."I think I'll just take a walk up to the camps and see how your birdsare getting on. Now Waldo's gone you've no one to see after things. Nicemorning, isn't it?" Then he added suddenly, "I'll just go round to thehouse and get a drink of water first;" and somewhat awkwardly walkedoff. He might have found water in the kitchen, but he never glancedtoward the buckets. In the front room a monkey and two tumblers stood onthe centre-table; but he merely looked round, peeped into the parlour,looked round again, and then walked out at the front door, and foundhimself again at the storeroom without having satisfied his thirst."Awfully nice morning this," he said, trying to pose himself in agraceful and indifferent attitude against the door. "It isn't hot and itisn't cold. It's awfully nice.""Yes," said Em."Your cousin, now," said Gregory in an aimless sort of way--"I supposeshe's shut up in her room writing letters.""No," said Em."Gone for a drive, I expect? Nice morning for a drive.""No.""Gone to see the ostriches, I suppose?""No." After a little silence Em added, "I saw her go by the kraals tothe kopje."Gregory crossed and uncrossed his legs."Well, I think I'll just go and have a look about," he said, "and seehow things are getting on before I go to the camps. Good-bye; so long."Em left for a while the bags she was folding and went to the window, thesame through which, years before, Bonaparte had watched the slouchingfigure cross the yard. Gregory walked to the pigsty first, andcontemplated the pigs for a few seconds; then turned round, and stoodlooking fixedly at the wall of the fuel-house as though he thoughtit wanted repairing; then he started off suddenly with the evidentintention of going to the ostrich-camps; then paused, hesitated, andfinally walked off in the direction of the kopje.Then Em went back to the corner and folded more sacks.On the other side of the kopje Gregory caught sight of a white tailwaving among the stones, and a succession of short, frantic barks toldwhere Doss was engaged in howling imploringly to a lizard who hadcrept between two stones, and who had not the slightest intention ofre-sunning himself at that particular moment.The dog's mistress sat higher up, under the shelving rock, her face bentover a volume of plays upon her knee. As Gregory mounted the stones shestarted violently and looked up; then resumed her book."I hope I am not troubling you," said Gregory as he reached her side."If I am I will go away. I just--""No; you may stay.""I fear I startled you.""Yes; your step was firmer than it generally is. I thought it was thatof some one else.""Who could it be but me?" asked Gregory, seating himself on a stone ather feet."Do you suppose you are the only man who would find anything to attracthim to this kopje?""Oh, no," said Gregory.He was not going to argue that point with her, nor any other; but no oldBoer was likely to take the trouble of climbing the kopje, and who elsewas there?She continued the study of her book."Miss Lyndall," he said at last, "I don't know why it is you never talkto me.""We had a long conversation yesterday," she said without looking up."Yes; but you ask me questions about sheep and oxen. I don't call thattalking. You used to talk to Waldo, now," he said, in an aggrieved toneof voice. "I've heard you when I came in, and then you've just left off.You treated me like that from the first day; and you couldn't tell fromjust looking at me that I couldn't talk about the things you like. I'msure I know as much about such things as Waldo does," said Gregory, inexceeding bitterness of spirit."I do not know which things you refer to. If you will enlighten me I amquite prepared to speak of them," she said, reading as she spoke."Oh, you never used to ask Waldo like that," said Gregory, in a moresorely aggrieved tone than ever. "You used just to begin.""Well, let me see," she said, closing her book and folding her hands onit. "There at the foot of the kopje goes a Kaffer; he has nothing on buta blanket; he is a splendid fellow--six feet high, with a magnificentpair of legs. In his leather bag he is going to fetch his rations, andI suppose to kick his wife with his beautiful legs when he gets home.He has a right to; he bought her for two oxen. There is a lean dog goingafter him, to whom I suppose he never gives more than a bone from whichhe has sucked the marrow; but his dog loves him, as his wife does. Thereis something of the master about him in spite of his blackness and wool.See how he brandishes his stick and holds up his head!""Oh, but aren't you making fun?" said Gregory, looking doubtfully fromher to the Kaffer herd, who rounded the kopje."No; I am very serious. He is the most interesting and intelligent thingI can see just now, except, perhaps, Doss. He is profoundly suggestive.Will his race melt away in the heat of a collision with a higher? Arethe men of the future to see his bones only in museums--a vestige of onelink that spanned between the dog and the white man? He wakes thoughtsthat run far out into the future and back into the past."Gregory was not quite sure how to take these remarks. Being abouta Kaffer, they appeared to be of the nature of a joke; but, beingseriously spoken, they appeared earnest; so he half laughed and halfnot, to be on the safe side."I've often thought so myself. It's funny we should both think the same;I knew we should if once we talked. But there are other things--love,now," he added. "I wonder if we would think alike about that. I wrote anessay on love once; the master said it was the best I ever wrote, and Ican remember the first sentence still--'Love is something that you feelin your heart.'""That was a trenchant remark. Can't you remember any more?""No," said Gregory, regretfully; "I've forgotten the rest. But tell mewhat do you think about love?"A look, half of abstraction, half amusement, played on her lips."I don't know much about love," she said, "and I do not like to talk ofthings I do not understand; but I have heard two opinions. Some say thedevil carried the seed from hell and planted it on the earth to plaguemen and make them sin; and some say, that when all the plants in thegarden of Eden were pulled up by the roots, one bush that the angelsplanted was left growing, and it spread its seed over the whole earth,and its name is love. I do not know which is right--perhaps both. Thereare different species that go under the same name. There is a love thatbegins in the head, and goes down to the heart, and grows slowly; butit lasts till death, and asks less than it gives. There is another love,that blots out wisdom, that is sweet with the sweetness of life andbitter with the bitterness of death, lasting for an hour; but it isworth having lived a whole life for that hour. I cannot tell, perhapsthe old monks were right when they tried to root love out; perhaps thepoets are right when they try to water it. It is a blood-red flower,with the colour of sin; but there is always the scent of a god aboutit."Gregory would have made a remark; but she said, without noticing:"There are as many kinds of loves as there are flowers; everlastingsthat never wither; speedwells that wait for the wind to fan them out oflife; blood-red mountain-lilies that pour their voluptuous sweetness outfor one day, and lie in the dust at night. There is no flower has thecharm of all--the speedwell's purity, the everlasting's strength, themountain-lily's warmth; but who knows whether there is no love thatholds all--friendship, passion, worship?"Such a love," she said, in her sweetest voice, "will fall on thesurface of strong, cold, selfish life as the sunlight falls on a torpidwinter world; there, where the trees are bare, and the ground frozen,till it rings to the step like iron, and the water is solid, and the airis sharp as a two-edged knife that cuts the unwary."But when its sun shines on it, through its whole dead crust a throbbingyearning wakes: the trees feel him, and every knot and bud swell, achingto open to him. The brown seeds, who have slept deep under the ground,feel him, and he gives them strength, till they break through the frozenearth, and lift two tiny, trembling green hands in love to him. And hetouches the water, till down to its depths it feels him and melts, andit flows, and the things, strange sweet things that were locked up init, it sings as it runs, for love of him. Each plant tries to bear atleast one fragrant little flower for him; and the world that was deadlives, and the heart that was dead and self-centred throbs, withan upward, outward yearning, and it has become that which it seemedimpossible ever to become. There, does that satisfy you?" she asked,looking down at Gregory. "Is that how you like me to talk?""Oh, yes," said Gregory, "that is what I have already thought. We havethe same thoughts about everything. How strange!""Very," said Lyndall, working with her little toe at a stone in theground before her.Gregory felt he must sustain the conversation. The only thing he couldthink of was to recite a piece of poetry. He knew he had learnt manyabout love; but the only thing that would come into his mind now was the"Battle of Hohenlinden," and "Not a drum was heard," neither of whichseemed to bear directly on the subject on hand.But unexpected relief came to him from Doss, who, too deeply lost incontemplation of his crevice, was surprised by the sudden descent ofthe stone Lyndall's foot had loosened, which, rolling against his littlefront paw, carried away a piece of white-skin. Doss stood on three legs,holding up the paw with an expression of extreme self-commiseration; hethen proceeded to hop slowly upward in search of sympathy."You have hurt that dog," said Gregory."Have I?" she replied indifferently, and re-opened the book, as thoughto resume her study of the play."He's a nasty, snappish little cur!" said Gregory, calculating from hermanner that the remark would be endorsed. "He snapped at my horse's tailyesterday, and nearly made it throw me. I wonder his master didn't takehim, instead of leaving him here to be a nuisance to all of us!"Lyndall seemed absorbed in her play; but he ventured another remark."Do you think now, Miss Lyndall, that he'll ever have anything in theworld--that German. I mean--money enough to support a wife on, and allthat sort of thing? I don't. He's what I call soft."She was spreading her skirt out softly with her left hand for the dog tolie down on it."I think I should be rather astonished if he ever became a respectablemember of society," she said. "I don't expect to see him the possessor ofbank-shares, the chairman of a divisional council, and the father ofa large family; wearing a black hat, and going to church twice on aSunday. He would rather astonish me if he came to such an end.""Yes; I don't expect anything of him either," said Gregory, zealously."Well, I don't know," said Lyndall; "there are some small things Irather look to him for. If he were to invent wings, or carve a statuethat one might look at for half an hour without wanting to look atsomething else, I should not be surprised. He may do some little thingof that kind perhaps, when he has done fermenting and the sediment hasall gone to the bottom."Gregory felt that what she said was not wholly intended as blame."Well, I don't know," he said sulkily; "to me he looks like a fool.To walk about always in that dead-and-alive sort of way, muttering tohimself like an old Kaffer witchdoctor! He works hard enough, but it'salways as though he didn't know what he was doing. You don't know how helooks to a person who sees him for the first time."Lyndall was softly touching the little sore foot as she read, and Doss,to show he liked it, licked her hand."But, Miss Lyndall," persisted Gregory, "what do you really think ofhim?""I think," said Lyndall, "that he is like a thorn-tree, which growsup very quietly, without any one's caring for it, and one day suddenlybreaks out into yellow blossoms.""And what do you think I am like?" asked Gregory, hopefully.Lyndall looked up from her book."Like a little tin duck floating on a dish of water, that comes after apiece of bread stuck on a needle, and the more the needle pricks it themore it comes on.""Oh, you are making fun of me now, you really are!" said Gregory feelingwretched. "You are making fun, aren't you, now?""Partly. It is always diverting to make comparisons.""Yes; but you don't compare me to anything nice, and you do otherpeople. What is Em like, now?""The accompaniment of a song. She fills up the gaps in other people'slives, and is always number two; but I think she is like manyaccompaniments--a great deal better than the song she is to accompany.""She is not half so good as you are!" said Gregory, with a burst ofuncontrollable ardour."She is so much better than I, that her little finger has more goodnessin it than my whole body. I hope you may not live to find out the truthof that fact.""You are like an angel," he said, the blood rushing to his head andface."Yes, probably; angels are of many orders.""You are the one being that I love!" said Gregory quivering. "I thoughtI loved before, but I know now! Do not be angry with me. I know youcould never like me; but, if I might but always be near you to serveyou, I would be utterly, utterly happy. I would ask nothing in return!If you could only take everything I have and use it; I want nothing butto be of use to you."She looked at him for a few moments."How do you know," she said slowly, "that you could not do something toserve me? You could serve me by giving me your name."He started, and turned his burning face to her."You are very cruel; you are ridiculing me," he said."No, I am not, Gregory. What I am saying is plain, matter-of-factbusiness. If you are willing to give me your name within three weeks'time, I am willing to marry you, if not, well. I want nothing more thanyour name. That is a clear proposal, is it not?"He looked up. Was it contempt, loathing, pity, that moved in the eyesabove! He could not tell; but he stooped over the little foot and kissedit.She smiled."Do you really mean it?" he whispered."Yes. You wish to serve me, and to have nothing in return!--you shallhave what you wish." She held out her fingers for Doss to lick. "Do yousee this dog? He licks my hand because I love him; and I allow him to.Where I do not love I do not allow it. I believe you love me; I toocould love so, that to lie under the foot of the thing I loved would bemore heaven than to lie in the breast of another. Come! let us go. Carrythe dog," she added; "he will not bite you if I put him in your arms.So--do not let his foot hang down."They descended the kopje. At the bottom, he whispered:"Would you not take my arm? the path is very rough."She rested her fingers lightly on it."I may yet change my mind about marrying you before the time comes. Itis very likely. Mark you!" she said, turning round on him; "I rememberyour words: You will give everything, and expect nothing. The knowledgethat you are serving me is to be your reward; and you will have that.You will serve me, and greatly. The reasons I have for marrying youI need not inform you of now; you will probably discover some of thembefore long.""I only want to be of some use to you," he said.It seemed to Gregory that there were pulses in the soles of his feet,and the ground shimmered as on a summer's day. They walked round thefoot of the kopje and past the Kaffer huts. An old Kaffer maid kneltat the door of one grinding mealies. That she should see him walkingso made his heart beat so fast, that the hand on his arm felt itspulsation. It seemed that she must envy him.Just then Em looked out again at the back window and saw them coming.She cried bitterly all the while she sorted the skins.But that night when Lyndall had blown her candle out, and half turnedround to sleep, the door of Em's bedroom opened."I want to say good night to you, Lyndall," she said, coming to thebedside and kneeling down."I thought you were asleep," Lyndall replied."Yes, I have been asleep; but I had such a vivid dream," she said,holding the other's hands, "and that woke me. I never had so vivid adream before."It seemed I was a little girl again, and I came somewhere into a largeroom. On a bed in the corner there was something lying dressed in white,and its little eyes were shut, and its little face was like wax. Ithought it was a doll, and I ran forward to take it; but some one heldup her finger and said: 'Hush! it is a little dead baby.' And I said:'Oh, I must go and call Lyndall, that she may look at it also.'"And they put their faces close down to my ear and whispered: 'It isLyndall's baby.'"And I said: 'She cannot be grown up yet; she is only a little girl!Where is she?' And I went to look for you, but I could not find you."And when I came to some people who were dressed in black, I asked themwhere you were, and they looked down at their black clothes, and shooktheir heads, and said nothing; and I could not find you anywhere. Andthen I awoke."Lyndall," she said, putting her face down upon the hands she held, "itmade me think about that time when we were little girls and used to playtogether, when I loved you better than anything else in the world. Itisn't any one's fault that they love you; they can't help it. And itisn't your fault; you don't make them love you. I know it.""Thank you, dear," Lyndall said. "It is nice to be loved, but it wouldbe better to be good."Then they wished good night, and Em went back to her room. Long afterLyndall lay in the dark thinking, thinking, thinking; and as she turnedround wearily to sleep she muttered:"There are some wiser in their sleeping than in their waking."Chapter 2.IX. Lyndall's Stranger.A fire is burning in the unused hearth of the cabin. The fuel blazesup, and lights the black rafters, and warms the faded red lions on thequilt, and fills the little room with a glow of warmth and light madebrighter by contrast, for outside the night is chill and misty.Before the open fireplace sits a stranger, his tall, slight figurereposing in the broken armchair, his keen blue eyes studying the firefrom beneath delicately pencilled, drooping eyelids. One white handplays thoughtfully with a heavy flaxen moustache; yet, once he starts,and for an instant the languid lids raise themselves; there is a keen,intent look upon the face as he listens for something. Then he leansback in his chair, fills his glass from the silver flask in his bag, andresumes his old posture.Presently the door opens noiselessly. It is Lyndall, followed by Doss.Quietly as she enters, he hears her, and turns."I thought you were not coming.""I waited till all had gone to bed. I could not come before."She removed the shawl that enveloped her, and the stranger rose to offerher his chair; but she took her seat on a low pile of sacks before thewindow."I hardly see why I should be outlawed after this fashion," he said,reseating himself and drawing his chair a little nearer to her; "theseare hardly the quarters one expects to find after travelling a hundredmiles in answer to an invitation.""I said, 'Come if you wish.'""And I did wish. You give me a cold reception.""I could not take you to the house. Questions would be asked which Icould not answer without prevarication.""Your conscience is growing to have a certain virgin tenderness," hesaid, in a low, melodious voice."I have no conscience. I spoke one deliberate lie this evening. I saidthe man who had come looked rough, we had best not have him in thehouse; therefore I brought him here. It was a deliberate lie, and I hatelies. I tell them if I must, but they hurt me.""Well, you do not tell lies to yourself, at all events. You are candid,so far."She interrupted him."You got my short letter?""Yes; that is why I come. You sent a very foolish reply; you must takeit back. Who is this fellow you talk of marrying?""A young farmer.""Lives here?""Yes; he has gone to town to get things for our wedding.""What kind of a fellow is he?""A fool.""And you would rather marry him than me?""Yes; because you are not one.""That is a novel reason for refusing to marry a man," he said, leaninghis elbow on the table and watching her keenly."It is a wise one," she said shortly. "If I marry him I shall shake himoff my hand when it suits me. If I remained with him for twelve monthshe would never have dared to kiss my hand. As far as I wish he shouldcome, he comes, and no further. Would you ask me what you might and whatyou might not do?"Her companion raised the moustache with a caressing movement from hislip and smiled. It was not a question that stood in need of any answer."Why do you wish to enter on this semblance of marriage?""Because there is only one point on which I have a conscience. I havetold you so.""Then why not marry me?""Because if once you have me you would hold me fast. I shall never befree again." She drew a long, low breath."What have you done with the ring I gave you?" he said."Sometimes I wear it; then I take it off and wish to throw it into thefire; the next day I put it on again, and sometimes I kiss it.""So you do love me a little?""If you were not something more to me than any other man in the world,do you think--" She paused. "I love you when I see you; but when you areaway from me I hate you.""Then I fear I must be singularly invisible at the present moment," hesaid. "Possibly if you were to look less fixedly into the fire you mightperceive me."He moved his chair slightly, so as to come between her and thefirelight. She raised her eyes to his face."If you do love me," he asked her, "why will you not marry me?""Because, if I had been married to you for a year I should have come tomy senses and seen that your hands and your voice are like the hands andthe voice of any other man. I cannot quite see that now. But it is allmadness. You call into activity one part of my nature; there is a higherpart that you know nothing of, that you never touch. If I marriedyou, afterward it would arise and assert itself, and I should hate youalways, as I do now sometimes.""I like you when you grow metaphysical and analytical," he said, leaninghis face upon his hand. "Go a little further in your analysis; say, 'Ilove you with the right ventricle of my heart, but not the left, andwith the left auricle of my heart, but not the right; and, this beingthe case, my affection for you is not of a duly elevated, intellectualand spiritual nature.' I like you when you get philosophical."She looked quietly at him; he was trying to turn her own weapons againsther."You are acting foolishly, Lyndall," he said, suddenly changing hismanner, and speaking earnestly, "most foolishly. You are acting like alittle child; I am surprised at you. It is all very well to have idealsand theories; but you know as well as any one can that they must not becarried into the practical world. I love you. I do not pretend that itis in any high, superhuman sense; I do not say that I should like you aswell if you were ugly and deformed, or that I should continue to prizeyou whatever your treatment of me might be, or to love you thoughyou were a spirit without any body at all. That is sentimentality forbeardless boys. Every one not a mere child (and you are not a child,except in years) knows what love between a man and a woman means. I loveyou with that love. I should not have believed it possible that Icould have brought myself twice to ask of any woman to be my wife, moreespecially one without wealth, without position, and who--""Yes--go on. Do not grow sorry for me. Say what you were going to--'whohas put herself into my power, and who has lost the right of meeting meon equal terms.' Say what you think. At least we two may speak the truthto one another."Then she added after a pause:"I believe you do love me, as much as you possibly could love anything;and I believe that when you ask me to marry you you are performing themost generous act you ever have performed in the course of your life, orever will; but, at the same time, if I had required your generosity, itwould not have been shown me. If, when I got your letter a monthago, hinting at your willingness to marry me, I had at once written,imploring you to come, you would have read the letter. 'Poor littledevil!' you would have said, and tore it up. The next week you wouldhave sailed for Europe, and have sent me a check for a hundred and fiftypounds (which I would have thrown in the fire), and I would have heardno more of you."The stranger smiled."But because I declined your proposal, and wrote that in three weeksI should be married to another, then what you call love woke up. Yourman's love is a child's love for butterflies. You follow till you havethe thing, and break it. If you have broken one wing, and the thingflies still, then you love it more than ever, and follow till you breakboth; then you are satisfied when it lies still on the ground.""You are profoundly wise in the ways of the world; you have seen farinto life," he said.He might as well have sneered at the firelight."I have seen enough to tell me that you love me because you cannot bearto be resisted, and want to master me. You liked me at first becauseI treated you and all men with indifference. You resolved to have mebecause I seemed unattainable. This is all your love means."He felt a strong inclination to stoop down and kiss the little lips thatdefied him; but he restrained himself. He said, quietly: "And you lovedme--""Because you are strong. You are the first man I ever was afraid of.And"--a dreamy look came into her face--"because I like to experience, Ilike to try. You don't understand that."He smiled."Well, since you will not marry me, may I inquire what your intentionsare, the plan you wrote of. You asked me to come and hear it, and I havecome.""I said, 'Come if you wish.' If you agree to it, well; if not, I marryon Monday.""Well?"She was still looking beyond him at the fire."I cannot marry you," she said slowly, "because I cannot be tied; but ifyou wish, you may take me away with you, and take care of me; thenwhen we do not love any more we can say good-bye. I will not go downcountry," she added; "I will not go to Europe. You must take me to theTransvaal. That is out of the world. People we meet there we need notsee again in our future lives.""Oh, my darling," he said, bending tenderly, and holding his hand outto her, "why will you not give yourself entirely to me? One day you willdesert me and go to another."She shook her head without looking at him."No, life is too long. But I will go with you.""When?""Tomorrow. I have told them that before daylight I go to the next farm.I will write from the town and tell them the facts. I do not want themto trouble me; I want to shake myself free of these old surroundings; Iwant them to lose sight of me. You can understand that is necessary forme."He seemed lost in consideration; then he said:"It is better to have you on those conditions than not at all. If youwill have it, let it be so."He sat looking at her. On her face was the weary look that rested thereso often now when she sat alone. Two months had not passed sincethey parted; but the time had set its mark on her. He looked at hercarefully, from the brown, smooth head to the little crossed feet on thefloor. A worn look had grown over the little face, and it made its charmfor him stronger. For pain and time, which trace deep lines and write astory on a human face, have a strangely different effect on one face andanother. The face that is only fair, even very fair, they mar and flaw;but to the face whose beauty is the harmony between that which speaksfrom within and the form through which it speaks, power is added by allthat causes the outer man to bear more deeply the impress of the inner.The pretty woman fades with the roses on her cheeks, and the girlhoodthat lasts an hour; the beautiful woman finds her fullness of bloomonly when a past has written itself on her, and her power is then mostirresistible when it seems going.From under their half-closed lids the keen eyes looked down at her. Hershoulders were bent; for a moment the little figure had forgotten itsqueenly bearing, and drooped wearily; the wide, dark eyes watched thefire very softly.It certainly was not in her power to resist him, nor any strength in herthat made his own at that moment grow soft as he looked at her.He touched one little hand that rested on her knee."Poor little thing!" he said; "you are only a child."She did not draw her hand away from his, and looked up at him."You are very tired?""Yes."She looked into his eyes as a little child might whom a long day's playhad saddened.He lifted her gently up, and sat her on his knee."Poor little thing!" he said.She turned her face to his shoulder, and buried it against his neck; hewound his strong arm about her, and held her close to him. When she hadsat for a long while, he drew with his hand the face down, and heldit against his arm. He kissed it, and then put it back in its oldresting-place."Don't you want to talk to me?""No.""Have you forgotten the night in the avenue?"He could feel that she shook her head."Do you want to be quiet now?""Yes."They sat quite still, excepting that only sometimes he raised herfingers softly to his mouth.Doss, who had been asleep in the corner, waking suddenly, plantedhimself before them, his wiry legs moving nervously, his yellow eyesfilled with anxiety. He was not at all sure that she was not beingretained in her present position against her will, and was not a littlerelieved when she sat up and held out her hand for the shawl."I must go," she said.The stranger wrapped the shawl very carefully about her."Keep it close around your face, Lyndall; it is very damp outside. ShallI walk with you to the house?""No. Lie down and rest; I will come and wake you at three o'clock."She lifted her face that he might kiss it, and, when he had kissed itonce, she still held it that he might kiss it again. Then he let herout. He had seated himself at the fireplace, when she reopened the door."Have you forgotten anything?""No."She gave one long, lingering look at the old room. When she was gone,and the door shut, the stranger filled his glass, and sat at the tablesipping it thoughtfully.The night outside was misty and damp; the faint moonlight, trying toforce its way through the thick air, made darkly visible the outlines ofthe buildings. The stones and walls were moist, and now and then a drop,slowly collecting, fell from the eaves to the ground. Doss, not likingthe change from the cabin's warmth, ran quickly to the kitchen doorstep;but his mistress walked slowly past him, and took her way up the windingfootpath that ran beside the stone wall of the camps. When she cameto the end of the last camp, she threaded her way among the stones andbushes till she reached the German's grave. Why she had come there shehardly knew; she stood looking down. Suddenly she bent and put one handon the face of a wet stone."I shall never come to you again," she said.Then she knelt on the ground, and leaned her face upon the stones."Dear old man, good old man, I am so tired!" she said (for we will cometo the dead to tell secrets we would never have told to the living)."I am so tired. There is light, there is warmth," she wailed; "why am Ialone, so hard, so cold? I am so weary of myself! It is eating mysoul to its core--self, self, self! I cannot bear this life! I cannotbreathe, I cannot live! Will nothing free me from myself?" She pressedher cheek against the wooden post. "I want to love! I want somethinggreat and pure to lift me to itself! Dear old man, I cannot bear it anymore! I am so cold, so hard, so hard; will no one help me?"The water gathered slowly on her shawl, and fell on to the wet stones;but she lay there crying bitterly. For so the living soul will cry tothe dead, and the creature to its God; and of all this crying therecomes nothing. The lifting up of the hands brings no salvation;redemption is from within, and neither from God nor man; it is wroughtout by the soul itself, with suffering and through time.Doss, on the kitchen doorstep, shivered, and wondered where his mistressstayed so long; and once, sitting sadly there in the damp, he haddropped asleep, and dreamed that old Otto gave him a piece of bread,and patted him on the head, and when he woke his teeth chattered, andhe moved to another stone to see if it was drier. At last he heard hismistress' step, and they went into the house together. She lit a candle,and walked to the Boer-woman's bedroom. On a nail under the lady inpink hung the key of the wardrobe. She took it down and opened the greatpress. From a little drawer she took fifty pounds (all she had in theworld), relocked the door, and turned to hang up the key. The marksof tears were still on her face, but she smiled. Then she paused,hesitated."Fifty pounds for a lover! A noble reward!" she said, and opened thewardrobe and returned the notes to the drawer, where Em might find them.Once in her own room, she arranged the few articles she intended to taketomorrow, burnt her old letters, and then went back to the front room tolook at the time. There were two hours yet before she must call him. Shesat down at the dressing-table to wait, and leaned her elbows on it, andburied her face in her hands. The glass reflected the little brown headwith its even parting, and the tiny hands on which it rested. "One day Iwill love something utterly, and then I will be better," she said once.Presently she looked up. The large, dark eyes from the glass looked backat her. She looked deep into them."We are all alone, you and I," she whispered; "no one helps us, no oneunderstands us; but we will help ourselves." The eyes looked back ather. There was a world of assurance in their still depths. So they hadlooked at her ever since she could remember, when it was but a smallchild's face above a blue pinafore. "We shall never be quite alone, youand I," she said; "we shall always be together, as we were when we werelittle."The beautiful eyes looked into the depths of her soul."We are not afraid; we will help ourselves!" she said. She stretchedout her hand and pressed it over them on the glass. "Dear eyes! we willnever be quite alone till they part us--till then!"Chapter 2.X. Gregory Rose Has An Idea.Gregory Rose was in the loft putting it neat. Outside the rain poured; asix months' drought had broken, and the thirsty plain was drenched withwater. What it could not swallow ran off in mad rivulets to the greatsloot, that now foamed like an angry river across the flat. Even thelittle furrow between the farmhouse and the kraals was now a stream,knee-deep, which almost bore away the Kaffer women who crossed it. Ithad rained for twenty-four hours, and still the rain poured on. Thefowls had collected--a melancholy crowd--in and about the wagon-house,and the solitary gander, who alone had survived the six months' want ofwater, walked hither and thither, printing his webbed footmarks on themud, to have them washed out the next instant by the pelting rain,which at eleven o'clock still beat on the walls and roofs with unabatedardour.Gregory, as he worked in the loft, took no notice of it beyond stuffinga sack into the broken pane to keep it out; and, in spite of the peltand patter, Em's clear voice might be heard through the open trap-doorfrom the dining room, where she sat at work, singing the "Blue Water:"     "And take me away,      And take me away,      And take me away,      To the Blue Water"--that quaint, childish song of the people, that has a world of sweetness,and sad, vague yearning when sung over and over dreamily by a woman'svoice as she sits alone at her work.But Gregory heard neither that nor yet the loud laughter of the Kaffermaids, that every now and again broke through from the kitchen, wherethey joked and worked. Of late Gregory had grown strangely impervious tothe sounds and sights about him. His lease had run out, but Em had said,"Do not renew it; I need one to help me; just stay on." And, she hadadded, "You must not remain in your own little house; live with me; youcan look after my ostriches better so."And Gregory did not thank her. What difference did it make to him,paying rent or not, living there or not; it was all one. But yet hecame. Em wished that he would still sometimes talk of the strengthof the master-right of man; but Gregory was as one smitten on thecheek-bone.She might do what she pleased, he would find no fault, had no word tosay. He had forgotten that it is man's right to rule. On that rainymorning he had lighted his pipe at the kitchen fire, and when breakfastwas over stood in the front door watching the water rush down the roadtill the pipe died out in his mouth. Em saw she must do something forhim, and found him a large calico duster. He had sometimes talked ofputting the loft neat, and today she could find nothing else for him todo. So she had the ladder put to the trap-door that he need not go outin the wet, and Gregory with the broom and duster mounted to the loft.Once at work he worked hard. He dusted down the very rafters, andcleaned the broken candle-moulds and bent forks that had stuck in thethatch for twenty years. He placed the black bottles neatly in rows onan old box in the corner, and piled the skins on one another, and sortedthe rubbish in all the boxes; and at eleven o'clock his work was almostdone. He seated himself on the packing-case which had once held Waldo'sbooks, and proceeded to examine the contents of another which he had notyet looked at. It was carelessly nailed down. He loosened one plank, andbegan to lift out various articles of female attire--old-fashioned caps,aprons, dresses with long pointed bodies such as he remembered to haveseen his mother wear when he was a little child.He shook them out carefully to see there were no moths, and then satdown to fold them up again one by one. They had belonged to Em's mother,and the box, as packed at her death, had stood untouched and forgottenthese long years. She must have been a tall woman, that mother of Em's,for when he stood up to shake out a dress the neck was on a level withhis, and the skirt touched the ground. Gregory laid a nightcap out onhis knee, and began rolling up the strings; but presently his fingersmoved slower and slower, then his chin rested on his breast, and finallythe imploring blue eyes were fixed on the frill abstractedly. When Em'svoice called to him from the foot of the ladder he started, and threwthe nightcap behind him.She was only come to tell him that his cup of soup was ready; and, whenhe could hear that she was gone, he picked up the nightcap again, anda great brown sun-kapje--just such a kapje and such a dress as one ofthose he remembered to have seen a sister of mercy wear. Gregory'smind was very full of thought. He took down a fragment of an oldlooking-glass from behind a beam, and put the kapje on. His beard lookedsomewhat grotesque under it; he put up his hand to hide it--that wasbetter. The blue eyes looked out with the mild gentleness that becameeyes looking out from under a kapje. Next he took the brown dress, and,looking round furtively, slipped it over his head. He had just gothis arms in the sleeves, and was trying to hook up the back, when anincrease in the patter of the rain at the window made him drag it offhastily. When he perceived there was no one coming he tumbled the thingsback into the box, and, covering it carefully, went down the ladder.Em was still at her work, trying to adjust a new needle in the machine.Gregory drank his soup, and then sat before her, an awful and mysteriouslook in his eyes."I am going to town tomorrow," he said."I'm almost afraid you won't be able to go," said Em, who was intent onher needle; "I don't think it is going to leave off today.""I am going," said Gregory.Em looked up."But the sloots are as full as rivers; you cannot go. We can wait forthe post," she said."I am not going for the post," said Gregory, impressively.Em looked for explanation; none came."When will you be back?""I am not coming back.""Are you going to your friends?"Gregory waited, then caught her by the wrist."Look here, Em," he said between his teeth, "I can't stand it any more.I am going to her."Since that day, when he had come home and found Lyndall gone, he hadnever talked of her; but Em knew who it was who needed to be spoken ofby no name.She said, when he had released her hand:"But you do not know where she is?""Yes, I do. She was in Bloemfontein when I heard last. I will go there,and I will find out where she went then, and then, and then! I will haveher."Em turned the wheel quickly, and the ill-adjusted needle sprung intotwenty fragments."Gregory," she said, "she does not want us; she told us so clearly inthe letter she wrote." A flush rose on her face as she spoke. "It willonly be pain to you, Gregory: Will she like to have you near her?"There was an answer he might have made, but it was his secret, and hedid not choose to share it. He said only:"I am going.""Will you be gone long, Gregory?""I do not know; perhaps I shall never come back. Do what you please withmy things. I cannot stay here!"He rose from his seat."People say, forget, forget!" he cried, pacing the room. They are mad!they are fools! Do they say so to men who are dying of thirst--forget,forget? Why is it only to us they say so! It is a lie to say that timemakes it easy; it is afterward, afterward that it eats in at your heart!"All these months," he cried bitterly, "I have lived here quietly, dayafter day, as if I cared for what I ate, and what I drank, and what Idid! I care for nothing! I cannot bear it! I will not! Forget! forget!"ejaculated Gregory. "You can forget all the world, but you cannot forgetyourself. When one thing is more to you than yourself, how are you toforget it?"I read," he said--"yes; and then I come to a word she used, and itis all back with me again! I go to count my sheep, and I see her facebefore me, and I stand and let the sheep run by. I look at you, and inyour smile, a something at the corner of your lips, I see her. How can Iforget her when, whenever I turn, she is there, and not there? I cannot,I will not, live where I do not see her."I know what you think," he said, turning upon her. "You think I am mad;you think I am going to see whether she will not like me! I am not sofoolish. I should have known at first she never could suffer me. Who amI, what am I, that she should look at me? It was right that she left me;right that she should not look at me. If any one says it is not, it isa lie! I am not going to speak to her," he added--"only to see her; onlyto stand sometimes in a place where she has stood before."Chapter 2.XI. An Unfinished Letter.Gregory Rose had been gone seven months. Em sat alone on a whitesheepskin before the fire.The August night-wind, weird and shrill, howled round the chimneys andthrough the crannies, and in walls and doors, and uttered a long low cryas it forced its way among the clefts of the stones on the kopje. It wasa wild night. The prickly-pear tree, stiff and upright as it heldits arms, felt the wind's might, and knocked its flat leaves heavilytogether, till great branches broke off. The Kaffers, as they slept intheir straw huts, whispered one to another that before morning therewould not be an armful of thatch left on the roofs; and the beams of thewagon-house creaked and groaned as if it were heavy work to resist theimportunity of the wind.Em had not gone to bed. Who could sleep on a night like this? So in thedining room she had lighted a fire, and sat on the ground before it,turning the roaster-cakes that lay on the coals to bake. It would savework in the morning; and she blew out the light because the wind throughthe window-chinks made it flicker and run; and she sat singing toherself as she watched the cakes. They lay at one end of the widehearth on a bed of coals, and at the other end a fire burnt up steadily,casting its amber glow over Em's light hair and black dress, withthe ruffle of crepe about the neck, and over the white curls of thesheepskin on which she sat.Louder and more fiercely yet howled the storm; but Em sang on, andheard nothing but the words of her song, and heard them only faintly, assomething restful. It was an old, childish song she had often heard hermother sing long ago:Where the reeds dance by the river, Where the willow's song is said, Onthe face of the morning water, Is reflected a white flower's head.She folded her hands and sang the next verse dreamily:     Where the reeds shake by the river,     Where the moonlight's sheen is shed,     On the face of the sleeping water,     Two leaves of a white flower float dead.          Dead, Dead, Dead!She echoed the refrain softly till it died away, and then repeated it.It was as if, unknown to herself, it harmonized with the pictures andthoughts that sat with her there alone in the firelight. She turned thecakes over, while the wind hurled down a row of bricks from the gable,and made the walls tremble.Presently she paused and listened; there was a sound as of somethingknocking at the back-doorway. But the wind had raised its level higher,and she went on with her work. At last the sound was repeated. Thenshe rose, lit the candle and the fire, and went to see. Only to satisfyherself, she said, that nothing could be out on such a night.She opened the door a little way, and held the light behind her todefend it from the wind. The figure of a tall man stood there, andbefore she could speak he had pushed his way in, and was forcing thedoor to close behind him."Waldo!" she cried in astonishment.He had been gone more than a year and a half."You did not expect to see me," he answered, as he turned toward her;"I should have slept in the outhouse, and not troubled you tonight; butthrough the shutter I saw glimmerings of a light.""Come in to the fire," she said; "it is a terrific night for anycreature to be out. Shall we not go and fetch your things in first?" sheadded."I have nothing but this," he said, motioning to the little bundle inhis hand."Your horse?""Is dead."He sat down on the bench before the fire."The cakes are almost ready," she said; "I will get you something toeat. Where have you been wandering all this while?""Up and down, up and down," he answered wearily; "and now the whim hasseized me to come back here. Em," he said, putting his hand on her armas she passed him, "have you heard from Lyndall lately?""Yes," said Em, turning quickly from him."Where is she? I had one letter from her, but that is almost a year agonow--just when she left. Where is she?""In the Transvaal. I will go and get you some supper; we can talkafterward.""Can you give me her exact address? I want to write to her."But Em had gone into the next room.When food was on the table she knelt down before the fire, turning thecakes, babbling restlessly, eagerly, now of this, now of that. Shewas glad to see him--Tant Sannie was coming soon to show her her newbaby--he must stay on the farm now, and help her. And Waldo himself waswell content to eat his meal in silence, asking no more questions."Gregory is coming back next week," she said; "he will have beengone just a hundred and three days tomorrow. I had a letter from himyesterday.""Where has he been?"But his companion stooped to lift a cake from the fire."How the wind blows! One can hardly hear one's own voice," she said."Take this warm cake; no one's cakes are like mine. Why, you have eatennothing!""I am a little weary," he said; "the wind was mad tonight."He folded his arms, and rested his head against the fireplace, whilstshe removed the dishes from the table. On the mantelpiece stood aninkpot and some sheets of paper. Presently he took them down and turnedup the corner of the tablecloth."I will write a few lines," he said; "till you are ready to sit down andtalk."Em, as she shook out the tablecloth, watched him bending intently overhis paper. He had changed much. His face had grown thinner; his cheekswere almost hollow, though they were covered by a dark growth of beard.She sat down on the skin beside him, and felt the little bundle on thebench; it was painfully small and soft. Perhaps it held a shirt and abook, but nothing more. The old black hat had a piece of unhemmed muslintwisted round it, and on his elbow was a large patch so fixed on withyellow thread that her heart ached. Only his hair was not changed, andhung in silky beautiful waves almost to his shoulders.Tomorrow she would take the ragged edge off his collar, and put a newband round his hat. She did not interrupt him, but she wondered how itwas that he sat to write so intently after his long weary walk. He wasnot tired now; his pen hurried quickly and restlessly over the paper,and his eye was bright. Presently Em raised her hand to her breast,where lay the letter yesterday had brought her. Soon she had forgottenhim, as entirely as he had forgotten her; each was in his own world withhis own. He was writing to Lyndall. He would tell her all he had seen,all he had done, though it were nothing worth relating. He seemed tohave come back to her, and to be talking to her now he sat there in theold house."--and then I got to the next town, and my horse was tired, so I couldgo no further, and looked for work. A shopkeeper agreed to hire me assalesman. He made me sign a promise to remain six months, and he gaveme a little empty room at the back of the store to sleep in. I had stillthree pounds of my own, and when you just come from the country threepounds seems a great deal."When I had been in the shop three days I wanted to go away again. Aclerk in a shop has the lowest work to do of all the people. It is muchbetter to break stones; you have the blue sky above you, and only thestones to bend to. I asked my master to let me go, and I offered to givehim my two pounds, and the bag of mealies I had bought with the otherpound; but he would not."I found out afterward he was only giving me half as much as he gave tothe others--that was why. I had fear when I looked at the other clerksthat I would at last become like them. All day they were bowing andsmirking to the women who came in; smiling, when all they wanted was toget their money from them. They used to run and fetch the dresses andribbons to show them, and they seemed to me like worms with oil on.There was one respectable thing in that store--it was the Kafferstoreman. His work was to load and unload, and he never needed to smileexcept when he liked, and he never told lies."The other clerks gave me the name of Old Salvation; but there was oneperson I liked very much. He was clerk in another store. He often wentpast the door. He seemed to me not like others--his face was bright andfresh like a little child's. When he came to the shop I felt I likedhim. One day I saw a book in his pocket, and that made me feel near him.I asked him if he was fond of reading, and he said, yes, when there wasnothing else to do. The next day he came to me, and asked me if I didnot feel lonely; he never saw me going out with the other fellows; hewould come and see me that evening, he said."I was glad, and bought some meat and flour, because the grey mare and Ialways ate mealies; it is the cheapest thing; when you boil it hard youcan't eat much of it. I made some cakes, and I folded my great coat onthe box to make it softer for him; and at last he came."'You've got a rummy place here,' he said."You see there was nothing in it but packing-cases for furniture, and itwas rather empty. While I was putting the food on the box he looked atmy books; he read their names out aloud. 'Elementary Physiology,' 'FirstPrinciples.'"'Golly!' he said; 'I've got a lot of dry stuff like that at home I gotfor Sunday-school prizes; but I only keep them to light my pipe withnow; they come in handy for that.' Then he asked me if I had ever reada book called the 'Black-eyed Creole.' 'That is the style for me,' hesaid; 'there where the fellow takes the nigger-girl by the arm, and theother fellow cuts it off! That's what I like.'"But what he said after that I don't remember, only it made me feel asif I were having a bad dream, and I wanted to be far away."When he had finished eating he did not stay long; he had to go and seesome girls home from a prayer-meeting; and he asked how it was he neversaw me walking out with any on Sunday afternoons. He said he had lots ofsweethearts, and he was going to see one the next Wednesday on a farm,and he asked me to lend my mare. I told him she was very old. But hesaid it didn't matter; he would come the next day to fetch her."After he was gone my little room got back to its old look. I lovedit so; I was so glad to get into it at night, and it seemed to bereproaching me for bringing him there. The next day he took the greymare. On Thursday he did not bring her back, and on Friday I found thesaddle and bridle standing at my door."In the afternoon he looked into the shop, and called out: 'Hope you gotyour saddle, Farber? Your bag-of-bones kicked out six miles from here.I'll send you a couple of shillings tomorrow, though the old hide wasn'tworth it. Good morning.'"But I sprung over the counter, and got him by his throat. My father wasso gentle with her; he never would ride her up hill, and now this fellowhad murdered her! I asked him where he had killed her, and I shook himtill he slipped out of my hand. He stood in the door grinning."'It didn't take much to kill that bag-of-bones, whose master sleepsin a packing-case, and waits till his company's finished to eat on theplate. Shouldn't wonder if you fed her on sugar-bags,' he said; 'andif you think I've jumped her, you'd better go and look yourself. You'llfind her along the road by the aasvogels that are eating her.'"I caught him by his collar, and I lifted him from the ground, andI threw him out into the street, half-way across it. I heard thebookkeeper say to the clerk that there was always the devil in those mumfellows; but they never called me Salvation after that."I am writing to you of very small things, but there is nothing else totell; it has been all small and you will like it. Whenever anything hashappened I have always thought I would tell it to you. The back thoughtin my mind is always you. After that only one old man came to visit me.I had seen him in the streets often; he always wore very dirty blackclothes, and a hat with crepe round it, and he had one eye, so Inoticed him. One day he came to my room with a subscription-list fora minister's salary. When I said I had nothing to give he looked at mewith his one eye."'Young man,' he said, 'how is it I never see you in the house of theLord?' I thought he was trying to do good, so I felt sorry for him, andI told him I never went to chapel. 'Young man,' he said, 'it grieves meto hear such godless words from the lips of one so young--so far gone inthe paths of destruction. Young man, if you forget God, God will forgetyou. There is a seat on the right-hand side as you go at the bottom doorthat you may get. If you are given over to the enjoyment and frivolitiesof this world, what will become of your never dying soul?'"He would not go till I gave him half a crown for the minister's salary.Afterward I heard he was the man who collected the pew rents and got apercentage. I didn't get to know any one else."When my time in that shop was done I hired myself to drive one of atransport-rider's wagons."That first morning, when I sat in the front and called to my oxen, andsaw nothing about me but the hills, with the blue coming down to them,and the karoo bushes, I was drunk; I laughed; my heart was beating tillit hurt me. I shut my eyes tight, that when I opened them I might seethere were no shelves about me. There must be a beauty in buying andselling, if there is beauty in everything: but it is very ugly to me. Mylife as transport-rider would have been the best life in the world if Ihad had only one wagon to drive. My master told me he would drive one, Ithe other, and he would hire another person to drive the third. But thefirst day I drove two to help him, and after that he let me drive allthree. Whenever we came to an hotel he stopped behind to get a drink,and when he rode up to the wagons he could never stand; the Hottentotand I used to lift him up. We always travelled all night, and used tooutspan for five or six hours in the heat of the day to rest. I plannedthat I would lie under a wagon and read for an hour or two every daybefore I went to sleep, and I did for the first two or three; but afterthat I only wanted to sleep, like the rest, and I packed my books away."When you have three wagons to look after all night, you are sometimesso tired you can hardly stand. At first when I walked along drivingmy wagons in the night it was glorious; the stars had never looked sobeautiful to me; and on the dark nights when we rode through the bushthere were will-o'-the-wisps dancing on each side of the road. I foundout that even the damp and dark are beautiful. But I soon changed, andsaw nothing but the road and my oxen. I only wished for a smooth pieceof road, so that I might sit at the front and doze. At the places wherewe outspanned there were sometimes rare plants and flowers, the festoonshanging from the bush-trees, and nuts and insects, such as we never seehere; but after a little while I never looked at them--I was too tired."I ate as much as I could, and then lay down on my face under the wagontill the boy came to wake me to inspan, and then we drove on again allnight; so it went, so it went. I think sometimes when I walked by myoxen I called to them in my sleep, for I know I thought of nothing; Iwas like an animal. My body was strong and well to work, but my brainwas dead. If you have not felt it, Lyndall, you cannot understand it.You may work, and work, and work, till you are only a body, not asoul. Now, when I see one of those evil-looking men that come fromEurope--navvies, with the beast-like, sunken face, different from anyKaffer's--I know what brought that look into their eyes; and if Ihave only one inch of tobacco I give them half. It is work, grinding,mechanical work, that they or their ancestors have done, that has madethem into beasts. You may work a man's body so that his soul dies. Workis good. I have worked at the old farm from the sun's rising till itssetting, but I have had time to think, and time to feel. You may work aman so that all but the animal in him is gone; and that grows strongerwith physical labour."You may work a man till he is a devil. I know it, because I have feltit. You will never understand the change that came over me. No one but Iwill ever know how great it was. But I was never miserable; when I couldkeep my oxen from sticking fast, and when I could find a place to liedown in, I had all I wanted. After I had driven eight months a rainyseason came. For eighteen hours out of the twenty-four we worked inthe wet. The mud went up to the axles sometimes, and we had to dig thewheels out, and we never went far in a day. My master swore at me morethan ever, but when he had done he always offered me his brandy-flask.When I first came he had offered it me, and I had always refused; butnow I drank as my oxen did when I gave them water--without thinking. Atlast I bought brandy for myself whenever we passed an hotel."One Sunday we outspanned on the banks of a swollen river to wait forits going down. It was drizzling still, so I lay under the wagon on themud. There was no dry place anywhere; and all the dung was wet, so therewas no fire to cook food. My little flask was filled with brandy, and Idrank some and went to sleep. When I woke it was drizzling still, soI drank some more. I was stiff and cold; and my master, who lay by me,offered me his flask, because mine was empty. I drank some, and then Ithought I would go and see if the river was going down. I remember thatI walked to the road, and it seemed to be going away from me. When Iwoke up I was lying by a little bush on the bank of the river. It wasafternoon; all the clouds had gone, and the sky was deep blue. TheBushman boy was grilling ribs at the fire. He looked at me and grinnedfrom ear to ear. 'Master was a little nice,' he said, 'and lay down inthe road. Something might ride over master, so I carried him there.' Hegrinned at me again. It was as though he said, 'You and I are comrades.I have lain in a road, too. I know all about it.'"When I turned my head from him I saw the earth, so pure after therain, so green, so fresh, so blue; and I was a drunken carrier, whom hisleader had picked up in the mud, and laid at the roadside to sleep outhis drink. I remember my old life, and I remember you. I saw how,one day, you would read in the papers: 'A German carrier, named WaldoFarber, was killed through falling from his wagon, being instantlycrushed under the wheel. Deceased was supposed to have been drunk at thetime of the accident.' There are those notices in the paper every month.I sat up, and I took the brandy-flask out of my pocket, and I flung itas far as I could into the dark water. The Hottentot boy ran down to seeif he could catch it; it had sunk to the bottom. I never drank again.But, Lyndall, sin looks much more terrible to those who look at it thanto those who do it. A convict, or a man who drinks, seems something sofar off and horrible when we see him; but to himself he seems quite nearto us, and like us. We wonder what kind of a creature he is; but he isjust we, ourselves. We are only the wood, the knife that carves on us isthe circumstance."I do not know why I kept on working so hard for that master. I think itwas as the oxen come every day and stand by the yokes; they do not knowwhy. Perhaps I would have been with him still; but one day we startedwith loads for the Diamond Fields. The oxen were very thin now, andthey had been standing about in the yoke all day without food, while thewagons were being loaded. Not far from the town was a hill. When we cameto the foot the first wagon stuck fast. I tried for a little while tourge the oxen, but I soon saw the one span could never pull it up. Iwent to the other wagon to loosen that span to join them on in front,but the transport-rider, who was lying at the back of the wagon, jumpedout."'They shall bring it up the hill; and if half of them die for it theyshall do it alone,' he said."He was not drunk, but in bad temper, for he had been drunk the nightbefore. He swore at me, and told me to take the whip and help him. Wetried for a little time, then I told him it was no use, they could neverdo it. He swore louder and called to the leaders to come on with theirwhips, and together they lashed. There was one ox, a black ox, so thinthat the ridge of his backbone almost cut through his flesh."'It is you, devil, is it, that will not pull?' the transport-ridersaid. 'I will show you something.' He looked like a devil."He told the boys to leave off flogging, and he held the ox by the horn,and took up a round stone and knocked its nose with it till the bloodcame. When he had done they called to the oxen and took up their whipsagain, and the oxen strained with their backs bent, but the wagon didnot move an inch."'So you won't, won't you?' he said. I'll help you.'"He took out his clasp-knife, and ran it into the leg of the tremblingox three times, up to the hilt. Then he put the knife in his pocket, andthey took their whips. The oxen's flanks quivered, and they foamed atthe mouth. Straining, they moved the wagon a few feet forward, thenstood with bent backs to keep it from sliding back. From the black ox'snostrils foam and blood were streaming on to the ground. It turned itshead in its anguish and looked at me with its great starting eyes. Itwas praying for help in its agony and weakness, and they took theirwhips again. The creature bellowed aloud. If there is a God, it wascalling to its Maker for help. Then a stream of clear blood burst fromboth nostrils; it fell on to the ground, and the wagon slipped back. Theman walked up to it."'You are going to lie down, devil, are you? We'll see you don't take ittoo easy.'"The thing was just dying. He opened his clasp-knife and stooped downover it. I do not know what I did then. But afterward I know I had himon the stones, and I was kneeling on him. The boys dragged me off. Iwish they had not. I left him standing in the sand in the road, shakinghimself, and I walked back to the town. I took nothing from thataccursed wagon, so I had only two shillings. But it did not matter. Thenext day I got work at a wholesale store. My work was to pack and unpackgoods, and to carry boxes, and I had to work from six in the morning tosix in the evening; so I had plenty of time."I hired a little room, and subscribed to a library, so I had everythingI needed; and in the week of Christmas holidays I went to see the sea.I walked all night, Lyndall, to escape the heat, and a little aftersunrise I got to the top of a high hill. Before me was a long, low,blue, monotonous mountain. I walked looking at it, but I was thinking ofthe sea I wanted to see. At last I wondered what that curious blue thingmight be; then it struck me it was the sea! I would have turned backagain, only I was too tired. I wonder if all the things we long tosee--the churches, the pictures, the men in Europe--will disappointus so! You see I had dreamed of it so long. When I was a little boy,minding sheep behind the kopje, I used to see the waves stretchingout as far as the eye could reach in the sunlight. My sea! Is the ideaalways more beautiful than the real?"I got to the beach that afternoon, and I saw the water run up and downon the sand, and I saw the white foam breakers; they were pretty, but Ithought I would go back the next day. It was not my sea."But I began to like it when I sat by it that night in the moonlight;and the next day I liked it better; and before I left I loved it. It wasnot like the sky and stars, that talk of what has no beginning and noend; but it is so human. Of all the things I have ever seen, only thesea is like a human being; the sky is not, nor the earth. But the sea isalways moving, always something deep in itself is stirring it. It neverrests. It is always wanting, wanting, wanting. It hurries on; and thenit creeps back slowly without having reached, moaning. It is alwaysasking a question, and it never gets the answer. I can hear it in theday and in the night; the white foam breakers are saying that which Ithink. I walk alone with them when there is no one to see me, and I singwith them. I lie down on the sand and watch them with my eyes half shut.The sky is better, but it is so high above our heads. I love thesea. Sometimes we must look down too. After five days I went back toGrahamstown."I had glorious books, and in the night I could sit in my little roomand read them; but I was lonely. Books are not the same things when youare living among people. I cannot tell why, but they are dead. On thefarm they would have been living beings to me; but here, where therewere so many people about me, I wanted some one to belong to me. I waslonely. I wanted something that was flesh and blood. Once on this farmthere came a stranger; I did not ask his name, but he sat among thekaroo and talked with me. Now, wherever I have travelled I have lookedfor him--in hotels, in streets, in passenger wagons as they rushed in,through the open windows of houses I have looked for him, but I have notfound him--never heard a voice like his. One day I went to the BotanicGardens. It was a half-holiday, and the band was to play. I stood in thelong raised avenue and looked down. There were many flowers, and ladiesand children were walking about beautifully dressed. At last the musicbegan. I had not heard such music before."At first it was slow and even, like the everyday life, when we walkthrough it without thought or feeling; then it grew faster, then itpaused, hesitated, then it was quite still for an instant, and then itburst out. Lyndall, they made heaven right when they made it all music.It takes you up and carries you away, away, till you have the thingsyou longed for, you are up close to them. You have got out into a large,free, open place. I could not see anything while it was playing; I stoodwith my head against my tree; but, when it was done, I saw that therewere ladies sitting close to me on a wooden bench, and the stranger whohad talked to me that day in the karoo was sitting between them. Theladies were very pretty, and their dresses beautiful. I do not thinkthey had been listening to the music, for they were talking and laughingvery softly. I heard all they said, and could even smell the rose on thebreast of one. I was afraid he would see me; so I went to the other sideof the tree, and soon they got up and began to pace up and down in theavenue."All the time the music played they chatted, and he carried on his armthe scarf of the prettiest lady. I did not hear the music; I tried tocatch the sound of his voice each time he went by. When I was listeningto the music I did not know I was badly dressed; now I felt so ashamedof myself. I never knew before what a low, horrible thing I was, dressedin tancord. That day on the farm, when we sat on the ground under thethorn-trees, I thought he quite belonged to me; now, I saw he was notmine. But he was still as beautiful. His brown eyes are more beautifulthan any one's eyes, except yours."At last they turned to go, and I walked after them. When they got outof the gate he helped the ladies into a phaeton, and stood for a momentwith his foot on the step talking to them. He had a little cane in hishand, and an Italian greyhound ran after him. Just when they drove awayone of the ladies dropped her whip."'Pick it up, fellow,' she said; and when I brought it her she threwsixpence on the ground. I might have gone back to the garden then; but Idid not want music; I wanted clothes, and to be fashionable and fine. Ifelt that my hands were coarse, and that I was vulgar. I never tried tosee him again."I stayed in my situation four months after that, but I was not happy.I had no rest. The people about me pressed on me, and made medissatisfied. I could not forget them. Even when I did not see them theypressed on me, and made me miserable. I did not love books; I wantedpeople. When I walked home under the shady trees in the street I couldnot be happy, for when I passed the houses I heard music, and saw facesbetween the curtains. I did not want any of them, but I wanted some onefor mine, for me. I could not help it. I wanted a finer life."Only one day something made me happy. A nurse came to the store with alittle girl belonging to one of our clerks. While the maid went into theoffice to give a message to its father, the little child stood lookingat me. Presently she came close to me and peeped up into my face."'Nice curls, pretty curls,' she said; 'I like curls.'"She felt my hair all over, with her little hands. When I put out my armshe let me take her and sit her on my knee. She kissed me with her softmouth. We were happy till the nurse-girl came and shook her, and askedher if she was not ashamed to sit on the knee of that strange man. But Ido not think my little one minded. She laughed at me as she went out."If the world was all children I could like it; but men and women drawme so strangely, and then press me away, till I am in agony. I was notmeant to live among people. Perhaps some day, when I am grown older, Iwill be able to go and live among them and look at them as I look at therocks, and bushes, without letting them disturb me, and take myself fromme; but not now. So I grew miserable; a kind of fever seemed to eat me;I could not rest, or read, or think; so I came back here. I knew youwere not here but it seemed as though I should be nearer you; and it isyou I want--you that the other people suggest to me, but cannot give."He had filled all the sheets he had taken, and now lifted down thelast from the mantelpiece. Em had dropped asleep, and lay slumberingpeacefully on the skin before the fire. Out of doors the storm stillraged; but in a fitful manner, as though growing half weary of itself.He bent over his paper again, with eager flushed cheek, and wrote on."It has been a delightful journey, this journey home. I have walked onfoot. The evening before last, when it was just sunset, I was a littlefootsore and thirsty, and went out of the road to look for water. I wentdown into a deep little kloof. Some trees ran along the bottom, and Ithought I should find water there. The sun had quite set when I got tothe bottom of it. It was very still--not a leaf was stirring anywhere.In the bed of the mountain torrent I thought I might find water. I cameto the bank, and leaped down into the dry bed. The floor on which Istood was of fine white sand, and the banks rose on every side like thewalls of a room."Above there was a precipice of rocks, and a tiny stream of water oozedfrom them and fell slowly on to the flat stone below. Each drop youcould hear fall like a little silver bell. There was one among the treeson the bank that stood cut out against the white sky. All the othertrees were silent; but this one shook and trembled against the sky.Everything else was still; but those leaves were quivering, quivering. Istood on the sand; I could not go away. When it was quite dark, and thestars had come, I crept out. Does it seem strange to you that it shouldhave made me so happy? It is because I cannot tell you how near I feltto things that we cannot see but we always feel. Tonight has been awild, stormy night. I have been walking across the plain for hours inthe dark. I have liked the wind, because I have seemed forcing my waythrough to you. I knew you were not here, but I would hear of you. WhenI used to sit on the transport wagon half-sleeping, I used to startawake because your hands were on me. In my lodgings, many nights I haveblown the light out, and sat in the dark, that I might see your facestart out more distinctly. Sometimes it was the little girl's face whoused to come to me behind the kopje when I minded sheep, and sit by mein her blue pinafore; sometimes it was older. I love both. I am veryhelpless; I shall never do anything; but you will work, and I will takeyour work for mine. Sometimes such a sudden gladness seizes me when Iremember that somewhere in the world you are living and working. You aremy very own; nothing else is my own so. When I have finished I am goingto look at your room door--"He wrote; and the wind, which had spent its fury, moaned round and roundthe house, most like a tired child weary with crying.Em woke up, and sat before the fire, rubbing her eyes, and listening, asit sobbed about the gables, and wandered away over the long stone walls."How quiet it has grown now," she said, and sighed herself, partlyfrom weariness and partly from sympathy with the tired wind. He did notanswer her; he was lost in his letter.She rose slowly after a time, and rested her hand on his shoulder."You have many letters to write," she said."No," he answered; "it is only one to Lyndall."She turned away, and stood long before the fire looking into it. If youhave a deadly fruit to give, it will not grow sweeter by keeping."Waldo, dear," she said, putting her hand on his, "leave off writing."He threw back the dark hair from his forehead and looked at her."It is no use writing any more," she said."Why not?" he asked.She put her hand over the papers he had written."Waldo," she said, "Lyndall is dead."Chapter 2.XII. Gregory's Womanhood.Slowly over the flat came a cart. On the back seat sat Gregory, his armsfolded, his hat drawn over his eyes. A Kaffer boy sat on the front seatdriving, and at his feet sat Doss, who, now and again, lifted his noseand eyes above the level of the splashboard, to look at the surroundingcountry; and then, with an exceedingly knowing wink of his left eye,turned to his companions, thereby intimating that he clearly perceivedhis whereabouts. No one noticed the cart coming. Waldo, who was at workat his carpenter's table in the wagon-house, saw nothing, till chancingto look down he perceived Doss standing before him, the legs trembling,the little nose wrinkled, and a series of short suffocating barks givingutterance to his joy at reunion.Em, whose eyes had ached with looking out across the plain, was now atwork in a back room, and knew nothing till, looking up, she saw Gregory,with his straw hat and blue eyes, standing in the doorway. He greetedher quietly, hung his hat up in its old place behind the door, and forany change in his manner or appearance he might have been gone only theday before to fetch letters from the town. Only his beard was gone, andhis face was grown thinner. He took off his leather gaiters, said theafternoon was hot and the roads dusty, and asked for some tea. Theytalked of wool, and the cattle, and the sheep, and Em gave him the pileof letters that had come for him during the months of absence, but ofthe thing that lay at their hearts neither said anything. Then he wentout to look at the kraals, and at supper Em gave him hot cakes andcoffee. They talked about the servants, and then ate their meal inquiet. She asked no questions. When it was ended Gregory went into thefront room, and lay in the dark on the sofa."Do you not want a light?" Em asked, venturing to look in."No," he answered; then presently called to her, "Come and sit here; Iwant to talk to you."She came and sat on a footstool near him."Do you wish to hear anything?" he asked.She whispered:"Yes, if it does not hurt you.""What difference does it make to me?" he said. "If I talk or am silent,is there any change?"Yet he lay quiet for a long time. The light through the open door showedhim to her, where he lay, with his arm thrown across his eyes. At lasthe spoke. Perhaps it was a relief to him to speak.To Bloemfontein in the Free State, to which through an agent he hadtraced them, Gregory had gone. At the hotel where Lyndall and herstranger had stayed he put up; he was shown the very room in which theyhad slept. The coloured boy who had driven them to the next town toldhim in which house they had boarded, and Gregory went on. In that townhe found they had left the cart, and bought a spider and four greys,and Gregory's heart rejoiced. Now indeed it would be easy to trace theircourse. And he turned his steps northward.At the farmhouses where he stopped the ooms and tantes rememberedclearly the spider with its four grey horses. At one place the Boer-wifetold how the tall, blue-eyed Englishman had bought milk, and asked theway to the next farm. At the next farm the Englishman had bought a bunchof flowers, and given half a crown for them to the little girl. It wasquite true; the Boer-mother made her get it out of the box and showit. At the next place they had slept. Here they told him that the greatbulldog, who hated all strangers, had walked in in the evening and laidits head in the lady's lap. So at every place he heard something, andtraced them step by step.At one desolate farm the Boer had a good deal to tell. The lady had saidshe liked a wagon that stood before the door. Without asking the pricethe Englishman had offered a hundred and fifty pounds for the old thing,and bought oxen worth ten pounds for sixteen. The Dutchman chuckled, forhe had the Salt-riem's money in the box under his bed. Gregory laughedtoo, in silence; he could not lose sight of them now, so slowly theywould have to move with that cumbrous ox-wagon. Yet, when that eveningcame, and he reached a little wayside inn, no one could tell himanything of the travellers.The master, a surly creature, half stupid with Boer-brandy, sat on thebench before the door smoking. Gregory sat beside him, questioning, buthe smoked on. He remembered nothing of such strangers. How should heknow who had been there months and months before? He smoked on. Gregory,very weary, tried to wake his memory, said that the lady he was seekingfor was very beautiful, had a little mouth, and tiny, very tiny, feet.The man only smoked on as sullenly as at first. What were little, verylittle, mouths and feet to him. But his daughter leaned out in thewindow above. She was dirty and lazy, and liked to loll there whentravellers came, to hear the men talk, but she had a soft heart.Presently a hand came out of the window, and a pair of velvet slipperstouched his shoulder, tiny slippers with black flowers. He pulled themout of her hand. Only one woman's feet had worn them, he knew that."Left here last summer by a lady," said the girl; "might be the one youare looking for. Never saw any feet so small."Gregory rose and questioned her.They might have come in a wagon and spider, she could not tell. But thegentleman was very handsome, tall, lovely figure, blue eyes, wore glovesalways when he went out. An English officer, perhaps; no Africander,certainly.Gregory stopped her.The lady? Well, she was pretty, rather, the girl said; very cold, dullair, silent. They stayed for, it might be, five days; slept in the wingover against the stoep; quarrelled sometimes, she thought--the lady.She had seen everything when she went in to wait. One day the gentlemantouched her hair; she drew back from him as though his fingers poisonedher. Went to the other end of the room if he came to sit near her.Walked out alone. Cold wife for such a handsome husband, the girlthought; she evidently pitied him, he was such a beautiful man. Theywent away early one morning, how, or in which way, the girl could nottell.Gregory inquired of the servants, but nothing more was to be learnt; sothe next morning he saddled his horse and went on. At the farms he cameto the good old ooms and tantes asked him to have coffee, and the littleshoeless children peeped out at the stranger from behind ovens andgables; but no one had seen what he asked for. This way and that he rodeto pick up the thread he had dropped, but the spider and the wagon, thelittle lady and the handsome gentleman, no one had seen. In the towns hefared yet worse.Once indeed hope came to him. On the stoep of an hotel at which hestayed the night in a certain little village, there walked a gentleman,grave and kindly-looking. It was not hard to open conversation with himabout the weather, and then--Had he ever seen such and such people,a gentleman and a lady, a spider and wagon, arrive at that place? Thekindly gentleman shook his head. What was the lady like, he inquired.Gregory painted. Hair like silken floss, small mouth, underlip very fulland pink, upper lip pink but very thin and curled; there were four whitespots on the nail of her right hand forefinger, and her eyebrows werevery delicately curved."Yes; and a rose-bud tinge in the cheeks; hands like lilies, andperfectly seraphic smile.""That is she! that is she!" cried Gregory.Who else could it be? He asked where she had gone to. The gentleman mostthoughtfully stroked his beard.He would try to remember. Were not her ears--. Here such a violent fitof coughing seized him that he ran away into the house. An ill-fedclerk and a dirty barman standing in the doorway laughed aloud. Gregorywondered if they could be laughing at the gentleman's cough, and then heheard some one laughing in the room into which the gentleman had gone.He must follow him and try to learn more; but he soon found that therewas nothing more to be learnt there. Poor Gregory!Backward and forward, backward and forward, from the dirty little hotelwhere he had dropped the thread, to this farm and to that, rode Gregory,till his heart was sick and tired. That from that spot the wagon mighthave gone its own way and the spider another was an idea that didnot occur to him. At last he saw it was no use lingering in thatneighbourhood, and pressed on.One day coming to a little town, his horses knocked up, and he resolvedto rest them there. The little hotel of the town was a bright and sunnyplace, like the jovial face of the clean little woman who kept it,and who trotted about talking always--talking to the customers in thetaproom, and to the maids in the kitchen, and to the passers-by when shecould hail them from the windows; talking, as good-natured women withlarge mouths and small noses always do, in season and out.There was a little front parlour in the hotel, kept for strangers whowanted to be alone. Gregory sat there to eat his breakfast, and thelandlady dusted the room and talked of the great finds at the DiamondFields, and the badness of maid-servants, and the shameful conduct ofthe Dutch parson in that town to the English inhabitants. Gregory atehis breakfast and listened to nothing. He had asked his one question,and had had his answer; now she might talk on.Presently a door in the corner opened and a woman came out--aMozambiquer, with a red handkerchief twisted round her head. Shecarried in her hand a tray, with a slice of toast crumbled fine, and ahalf-filled cup of coffee, and an egg broken open, but not eaten. Herebony face grinned complacently as she shut the door softly and said,"Good morning."The landlady began to talk to her."You are not going to leave her really, Ayah, are you?" she said. "Themaids say so; but I'm sure you wouldn't do such a thing."The Mozambiquer grinned."Husband says I must go home.""But she hasn't got any one else, and won't have any one else. Come,now," said the landlady, "I've no time to be sitting always in asickroom, not if I was paid anything for it."The Mozambiquer only showed her white teeth good-naturedly for answer,and went out, and the landlady followed her.Gregory, glad to be alone, watched the sunshine as it came over thefuchsias in the window, and ran up and down on the panelled door in thecorner. The Mozambiquer had closed it loosely behind her, and presentlysomething touched it inside. It moved a little, then it was still, thenmoved again; then through the gap a small nose appeared, and a yellowear overlapping one eye; then the whole head obtruded, placed itselfcritically on one side, wrinkled its nose disapprovingly at Gregory, andwithdrew. Through the half-open door came a faint scent of vinegar, andthe room was dark and still.Presently the landlady came back."Left the door open," she said, bustling to shut it; "but a darky willbe a darky, and never carries a head on its shoulders like other folks.Not ill, I hope sir?" she said, looking at Gregory when she had shut thebedroom door."No," said Gregory, "no."The landlady began putting the things together."Who," asked Gregory, "is in that room?"Glad to have a little innocent piece of gossip to relate, and some onewilling to hear it, the landlady made the most of a little story as shecleared the table. Six months before a lady had come alone to the hotelin a wagon, with only a coloured leader and driver. Eight days after alittle baby had been born.If Gregory stood up and looked out at the window he would see abluegum-tree in the graveyard; close by it was a little grave. The babywas buried there. A tiny thing--only lived two hours, and the motherherself almost went with it. After a while she was better; but one dayshe got up out of bed, dressed herself without saying a word to any one,and went out. It was a drizzly day; a little time after some one saw hersitting on the wet ground under the bluegum-tree, with the rain drippingfrom her hat and shawl. They went to fetch her, but she would not comeuntil she chose. When she did, she had gone to bed and had not risenagain from it; never would, the doctor said.She was very patient, poor thing. When you went in to ask her how shewas she said always "Better," or "Nearly well!" and lay still in thedarkened room, and never troubled any one. The Mozambiquer took careof her, and she would not allow any one else to touch her; would not somuch as allow any one else to see her foot uncovered. She was strangein many ways, but she paid well, poor thing; and now the Mozambiquer wasgoing, and she would have to take up with some one else.The landlady prattled on pleasantly, and now carried away the tray withthe breakfast things. When she was gone Gregory leaned his head on hishands, but he did not think long.Before dinner he had ridden out of the town to where on a rise a numberof transport-wagons were outspanned. The Dutchman driver of one wonderedat the stranger's eagerness to free himself of his horses. Stolenperhaps; but it was worth his while to buy them at so low a price. Sothe horses changed masters, and Gregory walked off with his saddlebagsslung across his arm. Once out of sight of the wagons he struck out ofthe road and walked across the veld, the dry, flowering grasses wavingeverywhere about him; half-way across the plain he came to a deep gullywhich the rain torrents had washed out, but which was now dry. Gregorysprung down into its red bed. It was a safe place, and quiet. When hehad looked about him he sat down under the shade of an overhanging bankand fanned himself with his hat, for the afternoon was hot, and he hadwalked fast. At his feet the dusty ants ran about, and the high red bankbefore him was covered by a network of roots and fibres washed bare bythe rains. Above his head rose the clear blue African sky; at his sidewere the saddlebags full of women's clothing. Gregory looked up halfplaintively into the blue sky."Am I, am I Gregory Nazianzen Rose?" he said.It was also strange, he sitting there in that sloot in that up-countryplain!--strange as the fantastic, changing shapes in a summer cloud. Atlast, tired out, he fell asleep, with his head against the bank. When hewoke the shadow had stretched across the sloot, and the sun was on theedge of the plain. Now he must be up and doing. He drew from his breastpocket a little sixpenny looking-glass, and hung it on one of the rootsthat stuck out from the bank. Then he dressed himself in one of theold-fashioned gowns and a great pinked-out collar. Then he took out arazor. Tuft by tuft the soft brown beard fell down into the sand, andthe little ants took it to line their nests with. Then the glass showeda face surrounded by a frilled cap, white as a woman's, with a littlemouth, a very short upper lip, and a receding chin.Presently a rather tall woman's figure was making its way across theveld. As it passed a hollowed-out antheap it knelt down, and stuffed inthe saddlebags with the man's clothing, closing up the anthill with bitsof ground to look as natural as possible. Like a sinner hiding his deedof sin, the hider started once and looked round, but yet there was noone near save a meerkat, who had lifted herself out of her hole and saton her hind legs watching. He did not like that even she should see, andwhen he rose she dived away into her hole. Then he walked on leisurely,that the dusk might have reached the village streets before he walkedthere. The first house was the smith's, and before the open door twoidle urchins lolled. As he hurried up the street in the gatheringgloom he heard them laugh long and loudly behind him. He glanced roundfearingly, and would almost have fled, but that the strange skirts clungabout his legs. And after all it was only a spark that had alighted onthe head of one, and not the strange figure they laughed at.The door of the hotel stood wide open, and the light fell out into thestreet. He knocked, and the landlady came. She peered out to look forthe cart that had brought the traveller; but Gregory's heart was bravenow he was so near the quiet room. He told her he had come with thetransport wagons that stood outside the town.He had walked in, and wanted lodgings for the night.It was a deliberate lie, glibly told; he would have told fifty, thoughthe recording angel had stood in the next room with his pen dipped inthe ink. What was it to him? He remembered that she lay there sayingalways: "I am better."The landlady put his supper in the little parlour where he had sat inthe morning. When it was on the table she sat down in the rocking-chair,as her fashion was to knit and talk, that she might gather news forher customers in the taproom. In the white face under the queer,deep-fringed cap she saw nothing of the morning's traveller. Thenewcomer was communicative. She was a nurse by profession, she said; hadcome to the Transvaal, hearing that good nurses were needed there. Shehad not yet found work. The landlady did not perhaps know whether therewould be any for her in that town?The landlady put down her knitting and smote her fat hands together.If it wasn't the very finger of God's providence, as though you saw ithanging out of the sky, she said. Here was a lady ill and needing a newnurse that very day, and not able to get one to her mind, and now--well,if it wasn't enough to convert all the Atheists and Freethinkers in theTransvaal, she didn't know!Then the landlady proceeded to detail facts."I'm sure you will suit her," she added; "you're just the kind. She hasheaps of money to pay you with; has everything that money can buy. And Igot a letter with a check in it for fifty pounds the other day from someone, who says I'm to spend it for her, and not to let her know. She isasleep now, but I'll take you in to look at her."The landlady opened the door of the next room, and Gregory followed her.A table stood near the bed, and a lamp burning low stood on it; the bedwas a great four-poster with white curtains, and the quilt was of richcrimson satin. But Gregory stood just inside the door with his head bentlow, and saw no further."Come nearer! I'll turn the lamp up a bit, that you can have a look ather. A pretty thing, isn't it?" said the landlady.Near the foot of the bed was a dent in the crimson quilt, and out of itDoss' small head and bright eyes looked knowingly.Then Gregory looked up at what lay on the cushion. A little white, whiteface, transparent as an angel's with a cloth bound round the forehead,and with soft hair tossed about on the pillow."We had to cut it off," said the woman, touching it with her forefinger."Soft as silk, like a wax doll's."But Gregory's heart was bleeding."Never get up again, the doctor says," said the landlady.Gregory uttered one word. In an instant the beautiful eyes openedwidely, looked round the room and into the dark corners."Who is here? Whom did I hear speak?"Gregory had sunk back behind the curtain; the landlady drew it aside,and pulled him forward."Only this lady, ma'am--a nurse by profession. She is willing to stayand take care of you, if you can come to terms with her."Lyndall raised herself on her elbow, and cast one keen scrutinizingglance over him."Have I never seen you before?" she asked."No."She fell back wearily."Perhaps you would like to arrange the terms between yourselves," saidthe landlady. "Here is a chair. I will be back presently."Gregory sat down, with bent head and quick breath. She did not speak,and lay with half-closed eyes, seeming to have forgotten him."Will you turn the lamp down a little?" she said at last; "I cannot bearthe light."Then his heart grew braver in the shadow, and he spoke. Nursing wasto him, he said, his chosen life's work. He wanted no money if-- Shestopped him."I take no service for which I do not pay," she said. "What I gave to mylast nurse I will give to you; if you do not like it you may go."And Gregory muttered humbly, he would take it.Afterward she tried to turn herself. He lifted her! Ah! a shrunkenlittle body, he could feel its weakness as he touched it. His hands wereto him glorified for what they had done."Thank you! that is so nice. Other people hurt me when they touch me,"she said. "Thank you!" Then after a little while she repeated humbly,"Thank you; they hurt me so."Gregory sat down trembling. His little ewe-lamb, could they hurt her?The doctor said of Gregory four days after, "She is the most experiencednurse I ever came in contact with."Gregory, standing in the passage, heard it and laughed in his heart.What need had he of experience? Experience teaches us in a millenniumwhat passion teaches us in an hour. A Kaffer studies all his life thediscerning of distant sounds; but he will never hear my step, when mylove hears it, coming to her window in the dark over the short grass.At first Gregory's heart was sore when day by day the body grew lighter,and the mouth he fed took less; but afterward he grew accustomed to it,and was happy. For passion has one cry, one only--"Oh, to touch thee,Beloved!"In that quiet room Lyndall lay on the bed with the dog at her feet, andGregory sat in his dark corner watching.She seldom slept, and through those long, long days she would liewatching the round streak of sunlight that came through the knot in theshutter, or the massive lion's paw on which the wardrobe rested. Whatthoughts were in those eyes? Gregory wondered; he dared not ask.Sometimes Doss where he lay on her feet would dream that they two werein the cart, tearing over the veld, with the black horses snorting, andthe wind in their faces; and he would start up in his sleep andbark aloud. Then awaking, he would lick his mistress' hand almostremorsefully, and slink quietly down into his place.Gregory thought she had no pain, she never groaned; only sometimes, whenthe light was near her, he thought he could see contractions about herlips and eyebrows.He slept on the sofa outside her door.One night he thought he heard a sound, and, opening it softly, he lookedin. She was crying out aloud, as if she and her pain were alone in theworld. The light fell on the red quilt, and the little hands that wereclasped over the head. The wide-open eyes were looking up, and the heavydrops fell slowly from them."I cannot bear any more, not any more," she said in a deep voice. "Oh,God, God! have I not borne in silence? Have I not endured these long,long months? But now, now, oh, God, I cannot!"Gregory knelt in the doorway listening."I do not ask for wisdom, not human love, not work, not knowledge, notfor all things I have longed for," she cried; "only a little freedomfrom pain! Only one little hour without pain! Then I will suffer again."She sat up, and bit the little hand Gregory loved.He crept away to the front door, and stood looking out at the quietstarlight. When he came back she was lying in her usual posture, thequiet eyes looking at the lion's claw. He came close to the bed."You have much pain tonight?" he asked her."No, not much.""Can I do anything for you?""No, nothing."She still drew her lips together, and motioned with her fingers towardthe dog who lay sleeping at her feet. Gregory lifted him and laid him ather side. She made Gregory turn open the bosom of her nightdress, thatthe dog might put his black muzzle between her breasts. She crossed herarms over him. Gregory left them lying there together.Next day, when they asked her how she was, she answered "Better.""Some one ought to tell her," said the landlady; "we can't let her soulgo out into eternity not knowing, especially when I don't think it wasall right about the child. You ought to go and tell her, doctor."So, the little doctor, edged on and on, went in at last. When he cameout of the room he shook his fist in the landlady's face."The next time you have any devil's work to do, do it yourself," hesaid, and he shook his fist in her face again, and went away swearing.When Gregory went into the bedroom he only found her moved, her bodycurled up, and drawn close to the wall. He dared not disturb her. Atlast, after a long time, she turned."Bring me food," she said, "I want to eat. Two eggs, and toast, andmeat--two large slices of toast, please."Wondering, Gregory brought a tray with all that she had asked for."Sit me up, and put it close to me," she said; "I am going to eatit all." She tried to draw the things near her with her fingers, andre-arranged the plates. She cut the toast into long strips, broke openboth eggs, put a tiny morsel of bread into her own mouth, and fed thedog with pieces of meat put into his jaws with her fingers."Is it twelve o'clock yet?" she said; "I think I do not generally eat soearly. Put it away, please, carefully--no, do not take it away--only onthe table. When the clock strikes twelve I will eat it."She lay down trembling. After a little while she said:"Give me my clothes."He looked at her."Yes; I am going to dress tomorrow. I should get up now, but it israther late. Put them on that chair. My collars are in the little box,my boots behind the door."Her eyes followed him intently as he collected the articles one by one,and placed them on the chair as she directed."Put it nearer," she said, "I cannot see it;" and she lay watching theclothes, with her hand under her cheek."Now open the shutter wide," she said; "I am going to read."The old, old tone was again in the sweet voice. He obeyed her; andopened the shutter, and raised her up among the pillows."Now bring my books to me," she said, motioning eagerly with herfingers; "the large book, and the reviews and the plays--I want themall."He piled them round her on the bed; she drew them greedily closer, hereyes very bright, but her face as white as a mountain lily."Now the big one off the drawers. No, you need not help me to hold mybook," she said; "I can hold it for myself."Gregory went back to his corner, and for a little time the restlessturning over of leaves was to be heard."Will you open the window," she said, almost querulously, "and throwthis book out? It is so utterly foolish. I thought it was a valuablebook; but the words are merely strung together, they make no sense.Yes--so!" she said with approval, seeing him fling it out into thestreet. "I must have been very foolish when I thought that book good."Then she turned to read, and leaned her little elbows resolutely on thegreat volume, and knit her brows. This was Shakespeare--it must meansomething."I wish you would take a handkerchief and tie it tight round my head, itaches so."He had not been long in his seat when he saw drops fall from beneath thehands that shaded the eyes, on to the page."I am not accustomed to so much light, it makes my head swim a little,"she said. "Go out and close the shutter."When he came back, she lay shrivelled up among the pillows.He heard no sound of weeping, but the shoulders shook. He darkened theroom completely.When Gregory went to his sofa that night, she told him to wake herearly; she would be dressed before breakfast. Nevertheless, when morningcame, she said it was a little cold, and lay all day watching herclothes upon the chair. Still she sent for her oxen in the country; theywould start on Monday and go down to the Colony.In the afternoon she told him to open the window wide, and draw the bednear it.It was a leaden afternoon, the dull rain-clouds rested close to theroofs of the houses, and the little street was silent and deserted.Now and then a gust of wind eddying round caught up the dried leaves,whirled them hither and thither under the trees, and dropped them againinto the gutter; then all was quiet. She lay looking out.Presently the bell of the church began to toll, and up the villagestreet came a long procession. They were carrying an old man to his lastresting-place. She followed them with her eyes till they turned in amongthe trees at the gate."Who was that?" she asked."An old man," he answered, "a very old man; they say he was ninety-four;but his name I do not know."She mused a while, looking out with fixed eyes."That is why the bell rang so cheerfully," she said. "When the old dieit is well; they have had their time. It is when the young die that thebells weep drops of blood.""But the old love life?" he said; for it was sweet to hear her speak.She raised herself on her elbow."They love life, they do not want to die," she answered, "but whatof that? They have had their time. They knew that a man's lifeis three-score years and ten; they should have made their plansaccordingly!"But the young," she said, "the young, cut down, cruelly, when they havenot seen, when they have not known--when they have not found--it is forthem that the bells weep blood. I heard in the ringing it was an oldman. When the old die-- Listen to the bell! it is laughing--'It isright, it is right; he has had his time.' They cannot ring so for theyoung."She fell back exhausted; the hot light died from her eyes, and she laylooking out into the street. By and by stragglers from the funeral beganto come back and disappear here and there among the houses; then allwas quiet, and the night began to settle down upon the village street.Afterward, when the room was almost dark, so that they could notsee each other's faces, she said, "It will rain tonight;" and movedrestlessly on the pillows. "How terrible when the rain falls down onyou."He wondered what she meant, and they sat on in the still darkening room.She moved again."Will you presently take my cloak--and new grey cloak from behind thedoor--and go out with it. You will find a little grave at the foot ofthe tall gum-tree; the water drips off the long, pointed leaves; youmust cover it up with that."She moved restlessly as though in pain.Gregory assented, and there was silence again. It was the first time shehad ever spoken of her child."It was so small," she said; "it lived such a little while--only threehours. They laid it close by me, but I never saw it; I could feel it byme." She waited; "its feet were so cold; I took them in my hand to makethem warm, and my hand closed right over them they were so little."There was an uneven trembling in the voice. "It crept close to me; itwanted to drink, it wanted to be warm." She hardened herself--"I did notlove it; its father was not my prince; I did not care for it; but it wasso little." She moved her hand. "They might have kissed it, one of them,before they put it in. It never did any one any harm in all its littlelife. They might have kissed it, one of them."Gregory felt that some one was sobbing in the room.Late on in the evening, when the shutter was closed and the lamplighted, and the rain-drops beat on the roof, he took the cloak frombehind the door and went away with it. On his way back he called atthe village post-office and brought back a letter. In the hall he stoodreading the address. How could he fail to know whose hand had writtenit? Had he not long ago studied those characters on the torn fragmentsof paper in the old parlour? A burning pain was at Gregory's heart.If now, now at the last, one should come, should step in between! Hecarried the letter into the bedroom and gave it to her. "Bring me thelamp nearer," she said. When she had read it she asked for her desk.Then Gregory sat down in the lamp-light on the other side of thecurtain, and heard the pencil move on the paper. When he looked roundthe curtain she was lying on the pillow musing. The open letter lay ather side; she glanced at it with soft eyes. The man with the languideyelids must have been strangely moved before his hand set down thosewords:"Let me come back to you! My darling, let me put my hand round you, andguard you from all the world. As my wife they shall never touch you.I have learnt to love you more wisely, more tenderly, than of old; youshall have perfect freedom. Lyndall, grand little woman, for your ownsake be my wife!"Why did you send that money back to me? You are cruel to me; it is notrightly done."She rolled the little red pencil softly between her fingers, and herface grew very soft. Yet:"It cannot be," she wrote; "I thank you much for the love you have shownme; but I cannot listen. You will call me mad, foolish--the world woulddo so; but I know what I need and the kind of path I must walk in. Icannot marry you. I will always love you for the sake of what lay by methose three hours; but there it ends. I must know and see, I cannot bebound to one whom I love as I love you. I am not afraid of the world--Iwill fight the world. One day--perhaps it may be far off--I shall findwhat I have wanted all my life; something nobler, stronger than I,before which I can kneel down. You lose nothing by not having me now;I am a weak, selfish, erring woman. One day I shall find something toworship, and then I shall be--""Nurse," she said; "take my desk away; I am suddenly so sleepy; I willwrite more tomorrow." She turned her face to the pillow; it was thesudden drowsiness of great weakness. She had dropped asleep in a moment,and Gregory moved the desk softly, and then sat in the chair watching.Hour after hour passed, but he had no wish for rest, and sat on,hearing the rain cease, and the still night settle down everywhere. Ata quarter-past twelve he rose, and took a last look at the bed where shelay sleeping so peacefully; then he turned to go to his couch. Before hehad reached the door she had started up and was calling him back."You are sure you have put it up?" she said, with a look of blank terrorat the window. "It will not fall open in the night, the shutter--you aresure?"He comforted her. Yes, it was tightly fastened."Even if it is shut," she said, in a whisper, "you cannot keep it out!You feel it coming in at four o'clock, creeping, creeping, up, up;deadly cold!" She shuddered.He thought she was wandering, and laid her little trembling body downamong the blankets."I dreamed just now that it was not put up," she said, looking into hiseyes; "and it crept right in and I was alone with it.""What do you fear?" he asked, tenderly."The Grey Dawn," she said, glancing round at the window. "I was neverafraid of anything, never, when I was a little child, but I have alwaysbeen afraid of that. You will not let it come in to me?""No, no; I will stay with you," he continued.But she was growing calmer. "No, you must go to bed. I only awoke with astart; you must be tired. I am childish, that is all;" but she shiveredagain.He sat down beside her, after some time she said: "Will you not rub myfeet?"He knelt down at the foot of the bed and took the tiny foot in his hand;it was swollen and unsightly now, but as he touched it he bent down andcovered it with kisses."It makes it better when you kiss it; thank you. What makes you all loveme so?" Then dreamily she muttered to herself: "Not utterly bad, notquite bad--what makes them all love me so?"Kneeling there, rubbing softly, with his cheek pressed against thelittle foot, Gregory dropped to sleep at last. How long he knelt therehe could not tell; but when he started up awake she was not looking athim. The eyes were fixed on the far corner, gazing wide and intent, withan unearthly light.He looked round fearfully. What did she see there? God's angels cometo call her? Something fearful? He saw only the purple curtain withthe shadows that fell from it. Softly he whispered, asking what she sawthere.And she said, in a voice strangely unlike her own: "I see the vision ofa poor, weak soul striving after good. It was not cut short, and in theend it learnt, through tears and much pain, that holiness is an infinitecompassion for others; that greatness is to take the common things oflife and walk truly among them; that"--She moved her white hand and laidit on her forehead--"happiness is a great love and much serving. It wasnot cut short; and it loved what it had learnt--it loved--and--"Was that all she saw in the corner?Gregory told the landlady the next morning that she had been wanderingall night. Yet, when he came in to give her her breakfast, she wassitting up against the pillows, looking as he had not seen her lookbefore."Put it close to me," she said, "and when I have had breakfast I amgoing to dress."She finished all he had brought her eagerly."I am sitting up quite by myself," she said. "Give me his meat;" and shefed the dog herself, cutting his food small for him. She moved to theside of the bed."Now bring the chair near and dress me. It is being in this room solong, and looking at that miserable little bit of sunshine that comes inthrough the shutter, that is making me so ill. Always that lion's paw!"she said, with a look of disgust at it. "Come and dress me." Gregoryknelt on the floor before her, and tried to draw on one stocking, butthe little swollen foot refused to be covered."It is very funny that I should have grown so fat since I have beenso ill," she said, peering down curiously. "Perhaps it is want ofexercise." She looked troubled and said again, "Perhaps it is want ofexercise." She wanted Gregory to say so too. But he only found a largerpair; and then tried to force the shoes, oh, so tenderly, on to herlittle feet."There," she said, looking down at them when they were on, with thedelight of a small child over its first shoes, "I could walk far now.How nice it looks!""No," she said, seeing the soft gown he had prepared for her, "I willnot put that on. Get one of my white dresses--the one with the pinkbows. I do not even want to think I have been ill. It is thinking andthinking of things that makes them real," she said. "When you drawyour mind together, and resolve that a thing shall not be, it gives waybefore you; it is not. Everything is possible if one is resolved," shesaid. She drew in her little lips together, and Gregory obeyed her; shewas so small and slight now it was like dressing a small doll. He wouldhave lifted her down from the bed when he had finished, but she pushedhim from her, laughing very softly. It was the first time she hadlaughed in those long, dreary months."No, no; I can get down myself," she said, slipping cautiously on to thefloor. "You see!" She cast a defiant glance of triumph when she stoodthere. "Hold the curtain up high, I want to look at myself."He raised it, and stood holding it. She looked into the glass on theopposite wall.Such a queenly little figure in its pink and white. Such a transparentlittle face, refined by suffering into an almost angel-like beauty. Theface looked at her; she looked back, laughing softly. Doss, quiveringwith excitement, ran round her, barking. She took one step toward thedoor, balancing herself with outstretched hands."I am nearly there," she said.Then she groped blindly."Oh, I cannot see! I cannot see! Where am I?" she cried.When Gregory reached her she had fallen with her face against the sharpfoot of the wardrobe and cut her forehead. Very tenderly he raised thelittle crushed heap of muslin and ribbons, and laid it on the bed. Dossclimbed up, and sat looking down at it. Very softly Gregory's handsdisrobed her."You will be stronger tomorrow, and then we shall try again," he said,but she neither looked at him nor stirred.When he had undressed her, and laid her in bed, Doss stretched himselfacross her feet and lay whining softly.So she lay all that morning, and all that afternoon.Again and again Gregory crept close to the bedside and looked at her;but she did not speak to him. Was it stupor or was it sleep that shoneunder those half-closed eyelids. Gregory could not tell.At last in the evening he bent over her."The oxen have come," he said; "we can start tomorrow if you like. ShallI get the wagon ready tonight?"Twice he repeated his question. Then she looked up at him, and Gregorysaw that all hope had died out of the beautiful eyes. It was not stuporthat shone there, it was despair."Yes, let us go," she said."It makes no difference," said the doctor; "staying or going; it isclose now."So the next day Gregory carried her out in his arms to the wagon whichstood inspanned before the door. As he laid her down on the kartel shelooked far out across the plain. For the first time she spoke that day."That blue mountain, far away; let us stop when we get to it, notbefore." She closed her eyes again. He drew the sails down before andbehind, and the wagon rolled away slowly. The landlady and the niggersstood to watch it from the stoep.Very silently the great wagon rolled along the grass-covered plain. Thedriver on the front box did not clap his whip or call to his oxen, andGregory sat beside him with folded arms. Behind them, in the closedwagon, she lay with the dog at her feet, very quiet, with folded hands.He, Gregory, dared not be in there. Like Hagar, when she laid hertreasure down in the wilderness, he sat afar off:--"For Hagar said, Letme not see the death of the child."Evening came, and yet the blue mountain was not reached, and all thenext day they rode on slowly, but still it was far off. Only at eveningthey reached it; not blue now, but low and brown, covered with longwaving grasses and rough stones. They drew the wagon up close to itsfoot for the night. It was a sheltered, warm spot.When the dark night had come, when the tired oxen were tied to thewheels, and the driver and leader had rolled themselves in theirblankets before the fire, and gone to sleep, then Gregory fastened downthe sails of the wagon securely. He fixed a long candle near the head ofthe bed, and lay down himself on the floor of the wagon near the back.He leaned his head against the kartel, and listened to the chewing ofthe tired oxen, and to the crackling of the fire, till, overpowered byweariness, he fell into a heavy sleep. Then all was very still in thewagon. The dog slept on his mistress' feet, and only two mosquitoes,creeping in through a gap in the front sail, buzzed drearily round.The night was grown very old when from a long, peaceful sleep Lyndallawoke. The candle burnt at her head, the dog lay on her feet; but heshivered; it seemed as though a coldness struck up to him from hisresting-place. She lay with folded hands, looking upward; and she heardthe oxen chewing, and she saw the two mosquitoes buzzing drearily roundand round, and her thoughts--her thoughts ran far back into the past.Through these months of anguish a mist had rested on her mind; it wasrolled together now, and the old clear intellect awoke from its longtorpor. It looked back into the past, it saw the present; there was nofuture now. The old strong soul gathered itself together for the lasttime; it knew where it stood.Slowly raising herself on her elbow, she took from the sail a glass thathung pinned there. Her fingers were stiff and cold. She put the pillowon her breast, and stood the glass against it. Then the white face onthe pillow looked into the white face in the glass. They had looked ateach other often so before. It had been a child's face once, looking outabove its blue pinafore; it had been a woman's face, with a dim shadowin the eyes, and a something which had said, "We are not afraid, you andI; we are together; we will fight, you and I." Now tonight it had cometo this.The dying eyes on the pillow looked into the dying eyes in the glass;they knew that their hour had come. She raised one hand and pressed thestiff fingers against the glass. They were growing very stiff. She triedto speak to it, but she would never speak again. Only the wonderfulyearning light was in the eyes still. The body was dead now, but thesoul, clear and unclouded, looked forth.Then slowly, without a sound, the beautiful eyes closed. The deadface that the glass reflected was a thing of marvelous beauty andtranquillity. The Grey Dawn crept in over it and saw it lying there.Had she found what she sought for--something to worship? Had she ceasedfrom being? Who shall tell us? There is a veil of terrible mist over theface of the Hereafter.Chapter 2.XIII. Dreams."Tell me what a soul desires, and I will tell you what it is." So runsthe phrase."Tell me what a man dreams, and I will tell you what he loves." Thatalso has its truth.For, ever from the earliest childhood to the latest age, day by day, andstep by step, the busy waking life is followed and reflected by the lifeof dreams--waking dreams, sleeping dreams. Weird, misty, and distortedas the inverted image of a mirage, or a figure seen through the mountainmist, they are still the reflections of a reality.On the night when Gregory told his story Waldo sat alone before thefire, his untasted supper before him. He was weary after his day'swork--too weary to eat. He put the plate down on the floor for Doss,who licked it clean, and then went back to his corner. After a time themaster threw himself across the foot of the bed without undressing, andfell asleep there. He slept so long that the candle burnt itself out,and the room was in darkness. But he dreamed a lovely dream as he laythere.In his dream, to his right rose high mountains, their tops crowned withsnow, their sides clothed with bush and bathed in the sunshine. At theirfeet was the sea, blue and breezy, bluer than any earthly sea, likethe sea he had dreamed of in his boyhood. In the narrow forest that ranbetween the mountains and the sea the air was rich that the scent of thehoney-creeper that hung from dark green bushes, and through the velvetygrass little streams ran purling down into the sea.He sat on a high square rock among the bushes, and Lyndall sat by himand sang to him. She was only a small child, with a blue pinafore, anda grave, grave, little face. He was looking up at the mountains, thensuddenly when he looked round she was gone. He slipped down from hisrock, and went to look for her, but he found only her little footmarks;he found them on the bright green grass, and in the moist sand, andthere where the little streams ran purling down into the sea. In andout, in and out, and among the bushes where the honey-creeper hung,he went looking for her. At last, far off, in the sunshine, he saw hergathering shells upon the sand. She was not a child now, but a woman,and the sun shone on her soft brown hair, and in her white dress she putthe shells she gathered. She was stooping, but when she heard his stepshe stood up, holding her skirt close about her, and waited for hiscoming. One hand she put in his, and together they walked on over theglittering sand and pink sea-shells; and they heard the leaves talking,and they heard the waters babbling on their way to the sea, and theyheard the sea singing to itself, singing, singing.At last they came to a place where was a long reach of pure white sand;there she stood still, and dropped on to the sand one by one theshells that she had gathered. Then she looked up into his face with herbeautiful eyes. She said nothing; but she lifted one hand and laid itsoftly on his forehead; the other she laid on his heart.With a cry of suppressed agony Waldo sprung from the bed, flung open theupper half of the door, and leaned out, breathing heavily.Great God! it might be only a dream, but the pain was very real,as though a knife ran through his heart, as though some treacherousmurderer crept on him in the dark! The strong man drew his breath like afrightened woman."Only a dream, but the pain was very real," he muttered, as he pressedhis right hand upon his breast. Then he folded his arms on the door, andstood looking out into the starlight.The dream was with him still; the woman who was his friend was notseparated from him by years--only that very night he had seen her. Helooked up into the night sky that all his life long had mingled itselfwith his existence. There were a thousand faces that he loved lookingdown at him, a thousand stars in their glory, in crowns, and circles,and solitary grandeur. To the man they were not less dear than to theboy they had been not less mysterious; yet he looked up at them andshuddered; at last turned away from them with horror. Such countlessmultitudes stretching out far into space, and yet not in one of them allwas she! Though he searched through them all, to the furthest, faintestpoint of light, nowhere should he ever say, "She is here!" Tomorrow'ssun would rise and gild the world's mountains, and shine into itsthousand valleys; it would set and the stars creep out again. Year afteryear, century after century, the old changes of nature would go on, dayand night, summer and winter, seed-time and harvest; but in none of themall would she have part!He shut the door to keep out their hideous shining, and because thedark was intolerable lit a candle, and paced the little room, faster andfaster yet. He saw before him the long ages of eternity that would rollon, on, on, and never bring her. She would exist no more. A dark mistfilled the little room."Oh, little hand! oh, little voice! oh, little form!" he cried; "oh,little soul that walked with mine! oh, little soul, that looked sofearlessly down into the depths, do you exist no more for ever--forall time?" He cried more bitterly: "It is for this hour--this--that menblind reason, and crush out thought! For this hour--this, this--theybarter truth and knowledge, take any lie, any creed, so it doesnot whisper to them of the dead that they are dead! Oh, God! for aHereafter!"Pain made his soul weak; it cried for the old faith. They are the tearsthat fall into the new-made grave that cement the power of the priest.For the cry of the soul that loves and loses is this, only this: "Bridgeover Death; blend the Here with the Hereafter; cause the mortal to robehimself in immortality; let me not say of my Dead that it is dead! Iwill believe all else, bear all else, endure all else!"Muttering to himself, Waldo walked with bent head, the mist in his eyes.To the soul's wild cry for its own there are many answers. He began tothink of them. Was not there one of them all from which he might suckone drop of comfort?"You shall see her again," says the Christian, the true Bible Christian."Yes, you shall see her again. 'And I saw the dead, great and small,stand before God. And the books were opened, and the dead were judgedfrom those things which were written in the books. And whosoever was notfound written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire, whichis the second death.' Yes; you shall see her again. She died so--withher knee unbent, with her hand unraised, with a prayer unuttered, in thepride of her intellect and the strength of her youth. She loved and shewas loved; but she said no prayer to God; she cried for no mercy; sherepented of no sin! Yes; you shall see her again."In his bitterness Waldo laughed low:Ah, he had long ceased to hearken to the hellish voice.But yet another speaks."You shall see her again," said the nineteenth-century Christian, deepinto whose soul modern unbelief and thought have crept, though he knowsit not. He it is who uses his Bible as the pearl-fishers use theirshells, sorting out gems from refuse; he sets his pearls after hisown fashion, and he sets them well. "Do not fear," he says; "hell andjudgment are not. God is love. I know that beyond this blue sky aboveus is a love as wide-spreading over all. The All-Father will show her toyou again; not spirit only--the little hands, the little feet you loved,you shall lie down and kiss them if you will. Christ arose, and dideat and drink, so shall she arise. The dead, all the dead, raisedincorruptible! God is love. You shall see her again."It is a heavenly song, this of the nineteenth-century Christian. Aman might dry his tears to listen to it, but for this one thing--Waldomuttered to himself confusedly:"The thing I loved was a woman proud and young; it had a mother once,who, dying, kissed her little baby, and prayed God that she might see itagain. If it had lived the loved thing would itself have had a son, who,when he closed the weary eyes and smoothed the wrinkled forehead of hismother, would have prayed God to see that old face smile again in theHereafter. To the son heaven will be no heaven if the sweet worn faceis not in one of the choirs; he will look for it through the phalanx ofGod's glorified angels; and the youth will look for the maid, and themother for the baby. 'And whose then shall she be at the resurrection ofthe dead?'""Ah, God! ah, God! a beautiful dream," he cried; "but can any one dreamit not sleeping?"Waldo paced on, moaning in agony and longing.He heard the Transcendentalist's high answer."What have you to do with flesh, the gross and miserable garment inwhich spirit hides itself? You shall see her again. But the hand, thefoot, the forehead you loved, you shall see no more. The loves, thefears, the frailties that are born with the flesh, with the flesh theyshall die. Let them die! There is that in man that cannot die--a seed,a germ an embryo, a spiritual essence. Higher than she was on earth, asthe tree is higher than the seed, the man than the embryo, so shall youbehold her; changed, glorified!"High words, ringing well; they are the offering of jewels to the hungry,of gold to the man who dies for bread. Bread is corruptible, gold isincorruptible; bread is light, gold is heavy; bread is common, gold israre; but the hungry man will barter all your mines for one morsel ofbread. Around God's throne there may be choirs and companies of angels,cherubim and seraphim, rising tier above tier, but not for one of themall does the soul cry aloud. Only perhaps for a little human woman fullof sin, that it once loved."Change is death, change is death!" he cried. "I want no angel, onlyshe; no holier and no better, with all her sins upon her, so give her meor give me nothing!"And, truly, does not the heart love its own with the strongest passionfor their very frailties? Heaven might keep its angels if men were butleft to men."Change is death," he cried, "change is death! Who dares to say the bodynever dies, because it turns again to grass and flowers? And yetthey dare to say the spirit never dies, because in space some strangeunearthly being may have sprung up upon its ruins. Leave me! Leave me!"he cried in frantic bitterness. "Give me back what I have lost, or giveme nothing."For the soul's fierce cry for immortality is this--only this: Return tome after death the thing as it was before. Leave me in the Hereafter thebeing that I am today. Rob me of the thoughts, the feelings, the desiresthat are my life, and you have left nothing to take. Your immortality isannihilation, your Hereafter is a lie.Waldo flung open the door, and walked out into the starlight, hispain-stricken thoughts ever driving him on as he paced there."There must be a Hereafter because man longs for it!" he whispered. "Isnot all life from the cradle to the grave one long yearning for thatwhich we never touch? There must be a Hereafter because we cannot thinkof any end to life. Can we think of a beginning? Is it easier to say'I was not' than to say 'I shall not be'? And yet, where were we ninetyyears ago? Dreams, dreams! Ah, all dreams and lies! No ground anywhere."He went back into the cabin and walked there. Hour after hour passed,and he was dreaming.For, mark you, men will dream; the most that can be asked of them is butthat the dream be not in too glaring discord with the thing they know.He walked with bent head.All dies, all dies! the roses are red with the matter that once reddenedthe cheek of the child; the flowers bloom the fairest on the last year'sbattleground; the work of death's finger cunningly wreathed over is atthe heart of all things, even of the living.Death's finger is everywhere. The rocks are built up of a life that was.Bodies, thoughts, and loves die: from where springs that whisper to thetiny soul of man, "You shall not die." Ah, is there no truth of whichthis dream is shadow?He fell into perfect silence. And, at last, as he walked there with hisbent head, his soul passed down the steps of contemplation into thatvast land where there is always peace; that land where the soul, gazinglong, loses all consciousness of its little self, and almost feels itshand on the old mystery of Universal unity that surrounds it."No death, no death," he muttered; "there is that which neverdies--which abides. It is but the individual that perishes, the wholeremains. It is the organism that vanishes, the atoms are there. It isbut the man that dies, the Universal Whole of which he is part reworkshim into its inmost self. Ah, what matter that man's day be short!--thatthe sunrise sees him, and the sunset sees his grave; that of which heis but the breath has breathed him forth and drawn him back again. Thatabides--we abide."For the little soul that cries aloud for continued personal existencefor itself and its beloved, there is no help. For the soul which knowsitself no more as a unit, but as a part of the Universal Unity of whichthe Beloved also is a part; which feels within itself the throb of theUniversal Life; for that soul there is no death."Let us die, beloved, you and I, that we may pass on forever through theUniversal Life! In that deep world of contemplation all fierce desiresdie out, and peace comes down." He, Waldo, as he walked there, saw nomore the world that was about him; cried out no more for the thing thathe had lost. His soul rested. Was it only John, think you, who saw theheavens open? The dreamers see it every day.Long years before the father had walked in the little cabin, andseen choirs of angels, and a prince like unto men, but clothed inimmortality.The son's knowledge was not as the father's, therefore the dream wasnew-tinted, but the sweetness was all there, the infinite peace that menfind not in the little cankered kingdom of the tangible. The bars ofthe real are set close about us; we cannot open our wings but they arestruck against them, and drop bleeding. But, when we glide between thebars into the great unknown beyond, we may sail forever in the gloriousblue, seeing nothing but our own shadows.So age succeeds age, and dream succeeds dream, and of the joy of thedreamer no man knoweth but he who dreameth.Our fathers had their dream; we have ours; the generation that followswill have its own. Without dreams and phantoms man cannot exist.Chapter 2.XIV. Waldo Goes Out to Sit in the Sunshine.It had been a princely day. The long morning had melted slowly into arich afternoon. Rains had covered the karoo with a heavy coat of greenthat hid the red earth everywhere. In the very chinks of the stone wallsdark green leaves hung out, and beauty and growth had crept even intothe beds of the sandy furrows and lined them with weeds. On the brokensod walls of the old pigsty chick-weeds flourished, and ice-plantslifted heir transparent leaves. Waldo was at work in the wagon-houseagain. He was making a kitchen table for Em. As the long curls gatheredin heaps before his plane, he paused for an instant now and again tothrow one down to a small naked nigger, who had crept from itsmother, who stood churning in the sunshine, and had crawled into thewagon-house.From time to time the little animal lifted its fat hand as it expecteda fresh shower of curls; till Doss, jealous of his master's noticing anyother small creature but himself, would catch the curl in his mouth androll the little Kaffer over in the sawdust, much to that small animal'scontentment. It was too lazy an afternoon to be really ill-natured, soDoss satisfied himself with snapping at the little nigger's fingers,and sitting on him till he laughed. Waldo, as he worked, glanced down atthem now and then, and smiled; but he never looked out across the plain.He was conscious without looking of that broad green earth; it made hiswork pleasant to him. Near the shadow at the gable the mother of thelittle nigger stood churning. Slowly she raised and let fall the stickin her hands, murmuring to herself a sleepy chant such as her peoplelove; it sounded like the humming of far-off bees.A different life showed itself in the front of the house, where TantSannie's cart stood ready inspanned and the Boer-woman herself sat inthe front room drinking coffee.She had come to visit her stepdaughter, probably for the last time, asshe now weighed two hundred and sixty pounds, and was not easily ableto move. On a chair sat her mild young husband nursing the baby--apudding-faced, weak-eyed child."You take it and get into the cart with it," said Tant Sannie. "What doyou want here, listening to our woman's talk?"The young man arose, and meekly went out with the baby."I'm very glad you are going to be married, my child," said Tant Sannie,as she drained the last drop from her coffee cup. "I wouldn't say sowhile that boy was here, it would make him too conceited; but marriageis the finest thing in the world. I've been at it three times, and if itpleased God to take this husband from me I should have another. There'snothing like it, my child; nothing.""Perhaps it might not suit all people, at all times, as well as it suitsyou, Tant Sannie," said Em. There was a little shade of weariness in thevoice."Not suit every one!" said Tant Sannie. "If the beloved Redeemer didn'tmean men to have wives what did He make women for? That's what I say.If a woman's old enough to marry, and doesn't, she's sinning against theLord--it's a wanting to know better than Him. What, does she think theLord took all that trouble in making her for nothing? It's evident Hewants babies, otherwise why does He send them? Not that I've done muchin that way myself," said Tant Sannie, sorrowfully; "but I've done mybest."She rose with some difficulty from her chair, and began moving slowlytoward the door."It's a strange thing," she said, "but you can't love a man till you'vehad a baby by him. Now there's that boy there, when we were firstmarried if he only sneezed in the night I boxed his ears; now if he letshis pipe-ash come on my milk-cloths I don't think of laying a fingeron him. There's nothing like being married," said Tant Sannie, as shepuffed toward the door. "If a woman's got a baby and a husband she'sgot the best things the Lord can give her; if only the baby doesn't haveconvulsions. As for a husband, it's very much the same who one has. Somemen are fat, and some men are thin; some men drink brandy, and some mendrink gin; but it all comes to the same thing in the end; it's all one.A man's a man, you know."Here they came upon Gregory, who was sitting in the shade before thehouse. Tant Sannie shook hands with him."I'm glad you're going to get married," she said. "I hope you'll have asmany children in five years as a cow has calves, and more too. I thinkI'll just go and have a look at your soap-pot before I start," she said,turning to Em. "Not that I believe in this new plan of putting sodain the pot. If the dear Father had meant soda to be put into soap whatwould He have made milk-bushes for, and stuck them all over the veld asthick as lambs in the lambing season?"She waddled off after Em in the direction of the built-in soap-pot,leaving Gregory as they found him, with his dead pipe lying on the benchbeside him, and his blue eyes gazing out far across the flat, like onewho sits on the seashore watching that which is fading, fading from him.Against his breast was a letter found in the desk addressed to himself,but never posted. It held only four words: "You must marry Em." He woreit in a black bag round his neck. It was the only letter she had everwritten to him."You see if the sheep don't have the scab this year!" said Tant Sannieas she waddled after Em. "It's with all these new inventions that thewrath of God must fall on us. What were the children of Israel punishedfor, if it wasn't for making a golden calf? I may have my sins, but Ido remember the tenth commandment: 'Honour thy father and mother that itmay be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long in the land whichthe Lord thy God giveth thee!' It's all very well to say we honour them,and then to be finding out things that they never knew, and doing thingsin a way that they never did them! My mother boiled soap with bushes,and I will boil soap with bushes. If the wrath of God is to fall uponthis land," said Tant Sannie, with the serenity of conscious virtue, "itshall not be through me.""Let them make their steam-wagons and their fire-carriages; let them goon as though the dear Lord didn't know what he was about when He gavehorses and oxen legs--the destruction of the Lord will follow them. Idon't know how such people read their Bibles. When do we hear of Mosesor Noah riding in a railway? The Lord sent fire-carriages out of heavenin those days: there's no chance of His sending them for us if we goon in this way," said Tant Sannie sorrowfully, thinking of the splendidchance which this generation had lost.Arrived at the soap-pot she looked over into it thoughtfully."Depend upon it you'll get the itch, or some other disease; the blessingof the Lord'll never rest upon it," said the Boer-woman. Then suddenlyshe broke forth. "And she eighty-two, and goats, and rams, and eightthousand morgen, and the rams real angora, and two thousand sheep, and ashort-horn bull," said Tant Sannie, standing upright and planting a handon each hip.Em looked at her in silent wonder. Had connubial bliss and the joys ofmotherhood really turned the old Boer-woman's head?"Yes," said Tant Sannie; "I had almost forgotten to tell you. By theLord if I had him here! We were walking to church last Sacrament Sunday,Piet and I. Close in front of us with old Tant Trana, with dropsy andcancer, and can't live eight months. Walking by her was something withits hands under its coat-tails, flap, flap, flap; and its chin in theair, and a stick-up collar, and the black hat on the very back of thehead. I knew him! 'Who's that?' I asked. 'The rich Englishman that TantTrana married last week.' 'Rich Englishman! I'll rich Englishman him,' Isaid; 'I'll tell Tant Trana a thing or two. My fingers were just in hislittle white curls. If it hadn't been the blessed Sacrament, he wouldn'thave walked so sourka, sourka, sourka, any more. But I thought. Waittill I've had it, and then--. But he, sly fox, son of Satan, seed of theAmalekite, he saw me looking at him in the church."The blessed Sacrament wasn't half over when he takes Tant Trana by thearm, and out they go. I clap my baby down to its father, and I go afterthem. But," said Tant Sannie, regretfully, "I couldn't get up to them;I am too fat. When I got to the corner he was pulling Tant Trana upinto the cart. 'Tant Trana,' I said, 'you've married a Kaffer's dog,a Hottentot's brakje.' I hadn't any more breath. He winked at me; hewinked at ME," said Tant Sannie, her sides shaking with indignation,"first with one eye, and then with the other, and then drove away. Childof the Amalekite!" said Tant Sannie, "if it hadn't been the blessedSacrament. Lord, Lord, Lord!"Here the little Bush-girl came running to say that the horses wouldstand no longer, and still breathing out vengeance against her oldadversary she laboured toward the cart. Shaking hands and affectionatelykissing Em, she was with some difficulty drawn up. Then slowly the cartrolled away, the good Boer-woman putting her head out between the sailsto smile and nod.Em stood watching it for a time, then as the sun dazzled her eyes sheturned away. There was no use in going to sit with Gregory! he likedbest sitting there alone, staring across the the green karoo; and tillthe maid had done churning there was nothing to do; so Em walked awayto the wagon-house, and climbed on to the end of Waldo's table, andsat there, swinging one little foot slowly to and fro, while the woodencurls from the plane heaped themselves up against her black print dress."Waldo," she said at last, "Gregory has given me the money he got forthe wagon and oxen, and I have fifty pounds besides that once belongedto some one. I know what they would have liked to have done with it. Youmust take it and go to some place and study for a year or two.""No, little one, I will not take it," he said, as he planed slowly away;"the time was when I would have been very grateful to any one who wouldhave given me a little money, a little help, a little power of gainingknowledge. But now, I have gone so far alone I may go on to the end. Idon't want it, little one."She did not seem pained at his refusal, but swung her foot to and fro,the little old wrinkled forehead more wrinkled up than ever."Why is it always so, Waldo, always so?" she said; "we long for things,and long for them, and pray for them; we would give all we have to comenear to them, but we never reach them. Then at last, too late, justwhen we don't want them any more, when all the sweetness is taken out ofthem, then they come. We don't want them then," she said, foldingtheir hands resignedly on her little apron. After a while she added: "Iremember once, very long ago, when I was a very little girl, my motherhad a workbox full of coloured reels. I always wanted to play with them,but she would never let me. At last one day she said I might take thebox. I was so glad I hardly knew what to do. I ran round the house, andsat down with it on the back steps. But when I opened the box all thecottons were taken out."She sat for a while longer, till the Kaffer maid had finished churning,and was carrying the butter toward the house. Then Em prepared to slipoff the table, but first she laid her little hand on Waldo's. He stoppedhis planing and looked up."Gregory is going to the town tomorrow. He is going to give in our bansto the minister; we are going to be married in three weeks."Waldo lifted her very gently from the table. He did not congratulateher; perhaps he thought of the empty box, but he kissed her foreheadgravely.She walked away toward the house, but stopped when she got half-way. "Iwill bring you a glass of buttermilk when it is cool," she called out;and soon her clear voice came ringing out through the back windows asshe sang the "Blue Water" to herself, and washed the butter.Waldo did not wait till she returned. Perhaps he had at last reallygrown weary of work; perhaps he felt the wagon-house chilly (for he hadshuddered two or three times), though this was hardly likely in thatwarm summer weather; or, perhaps, and most probably, one of his olddreaming fits had come upon him suddenly.He put his tools together, ready for tomorrow, and walked slowly out. Atthe side of the wagon-house there was a world of bright sunshine, anda hen with her chickens was scratching among the gravel. Waldo seatedhimself near them with his back against the red-brick wall. The longafternoon was half spent, and the kopje was just beginning to cast itsshadow over the round-headed yellow flowers that grew between it and thefarmhouse. Among the flowers the white butterflies hovered and on theold kraal mounds three white kids gambolled, and at the door of one ofthe huts an old grey-headed Kaffer-woman sat on the ground mending hermats. A balmy, restful peacefulness seemed to reign everywhere. Even theold hen seemed well satisfied. She scratched among the stones and calledto her chickens when she found a treasure; and all the while tucked toherself with intense inward satisfaction.Waldo, as he sat with his knees drawn up to his chin and his armsfolded on them, looked at it all and smiled. An evil world, a deceitful,treacherous, mirage-like world it might be; but a lovely world for allthat, and to sit there gloating in the sunlight was perfect. It wasworth having been a little child, and having cried and prayed so onemight sit there. He moved his hands as though he were washing them inthe sunshine. There will always be something worth living for whilethere are shimmery afternoons. Waldo chuckled with intense inwardsatisfaction as the old hen had done--she, over the insects and thewarmth; he, over the old brick walls, and the haze, and the littlebushes. Beauty is God's wine, with which He recompenses the souls thatlove Him; He makes them drunk.The fellow looked, and at last stretched out one hand to a littleice-plant that grew on the sod wall of the sty; not as though he wouldhave picked it, but as it were in a friendly greeting. He loved it. Onelittle leaf of the ice-plant stood upright, and the sun shone throughit. He could see every little crystal cell like a drop of ice in thetransparent green, and it thrilled him.There are only rare times when a man's soul can see Nature.So long as any passion holds its revel there, the eyes are holden thatthey should not see her.Go out if you will and walk alone on the hillside in the evening, but ifyour favourite child lies ill at home, or your lover comes tomorrow, orat your heart there lies a scheme for the holding of wealth, then youwill return as you went out; you will have seen nothing. For Nature,ever, like the Old Hebrew God, cries out, "Thou shalt have no other godsbefore me." Only then, when there comes a pause, a blank in your life,when the old idol is broken, when the old hope is dead, when the olddesire is crushed, then the Divine compensation of Nature is mademanifest. She shows herself to you. So near she draws you, that theblood seems to flow from her to you, through a still uncut cord: youfeel the throb of her life.When that day comes, that you sit down broken, without one humancreature to whom you cling, with your loves the dead and theliving-dead; when the very thirst for knowledge through long-continuedthwarting has grown dull; when in the present there is no craving, andin the future no hope, then, oh, with a beneficent tenderness, Natureinfolds you.Then the large white snow-flakes as they flutter down, softly, one byone, whisper soothingly, "Rest, poor heart, rest!" It is as though ourmother smoothed our hair, and we are comforted.And yellow-legged bees as they hum make a dreamy lyric; and the light onthe brown stone wall is a great work of art; and the glitter through theleaves makes the pulses beat.Well to die then; for, if you live, so surely as the years come, sosurely as the spring succeeds the winter, so surely will passions arise.They will creep back, one by one, into the bosom that has cast themforth, and fasten there again, and peace will go. Desire, ambition,and the fierce agonizing flood of love for the living they will springagain. Then Nature will draw down her veil; with all your longing youshall not be able to raise one corner; you cannot bring back thosepeaceful days. Well to die then!Sitting there with his arms folded on his knees, and his hat sloucheddown over his face, Waldo looked out into the yellow sunshine thattinted even the very air with the colour of ripe corn, and was happy.He was an uncouth creature with small learning, and no prospect in thefuture but that of making endless tables and stone walls, yet it seemedto him as he sat there that life was a rare and very rich thing. Herubbed his hands in the sunshine. Ah, to live on so, year after year,how well! Always in the present; letting each day glide, bringing itsown labour, and its own beauty; the gradual lighting up of the hills,night and the stars, firelight and the coals! To live on so, calmly, farfrom the paths of men; and to look at the lives of clouds and insects;to look deep into the heart of flowers, and see how lovingly the pistiland the stamens nestle there together; and to see in the thorn-pods howthe little seeds suck their life through the delicate curled-up string,and how the little embryo sleeps inside! Well, how well, to sit so onone side taking no part in the world's life; but when great men blossominto books looking into those flowers also, to see how the world of mentoo opens beautifully, leaf after leaf. Ah! life is delicious; well tolive long, and see the darkness breaking, and the day coming! The daywhen soul shall not thrust back soul that would come to it; when menshall not be driven to seek solitude because of the crying-out of theirhearts for love and sympathy. Well to live long and see the new timebreaking. Well to live long; life is sweet, sweet, sweet! In his breastpocket, where of old the broken slate used to be, there was now a littledancing shoe of his friend who was sleeping. He could feel it when hefolded his arm tight against his breast; and that was well also. Hedrew his hat lower over his eyes and sat so motionless that the chickensthought he was asleep, and gathered closer around him. One even venturedto peck at his boot, but he ran away quickly. Tiny, yellow fellow thathe was, he knew that men were dangerous; even sleeping they mightawake. But Waldo did not sleep, and coming back from his sunshiny dream,stretched out his hand for the tiny thing to mount. But the chicken eyedthe hand, and then ran off to hide under its mother's wing, and frombeneath it it sometimes put out its round head to peep at the greatfigure sitting there. Presently its brothers ran off after a littlewhite moth and it ran out to join them; and when the moth fluttered awayover their heads they stood looking up disappointed, and then ran backto their mother.Waldo through his half-closed eyes looked at them. Thinking, fearing,craving, those tiny sparks of brother life, what were they, so realthere in that old yard on that sunshiny afternoon? A few years--wherewould they be? Strange little brother spirits! He stretched his handtoward them, for his heart went out to them; but not one of the littlecreatures came nearer him, and he watched them gravely for a time;then he smiled, and began muttering to himself after his old fashion.Afterward he folded his arms upon his knees, and rested his forehead onthem. And so he sat there in the yellow sunshine, muttering, muttering,muttering, to himself.It was not very long after when Em came out at the back door with atowel thrown across her head, and in her hand a cup of milk."Ah," she said, coming close to him, "he is sleeping now. He will findit when he wakes, and be glad of it."She put it down upon the ground beside him. The mother-hen was at workstill among the stones, but the chickens had climbed about him and wereperching on him. One stood upon his shoulder, and rubbed its little headsoftly against his black curls: another tried to balance itself on thevery edge of the old felt hat. One tiny fellow stood upon his hand, andtried to crow; another had nestled itself down comfortably on the oldcoat-sleeve and gone to sleep there.Em did not drive them away; but she covered the glass softly at hisside.
