In 1908 I read in the British Museummany newspapers and journals for the years 1860-1865, and then planned asurvey of English public opinion on the American Civil War. In thesucceeding years as a teacher at Stanford University, California, thepublished diplomatic correspondence of Great Britain and of the UnitedStates were studied in connection with instruction given in the field ofBritish-American relations. Several of my students prepared excellenttheses on special topics and these have been acknowledged where used inthis work. Many distractions and other writing prevented the completionof my original plan; and fortunately, for when in 1913 I had at lastbegun this work and had prepared three chapters, a letter was receivedfrom the late Charles Francis Adams inviting me to collaborate with himin preparing a "Life" of his father, the Charles Francis Adams who wasAmerican Minister to Great Britain during the Civil War. Mr. Adams hadrecently returned from England where he had given at Oxford University aseries of lectures on the Civil War and had been so fortunate as toobtain copies, made under the scholarly supervision of Mr. WorthingtonC. Ford, of a great mass of correspondence from the Foreign Office filesin the Public Record Office and from the private papers in thepossession of various families.The first half of the year 1914 was spent with Mr. Adams at Washingtonand at South Lincoln, in preparing the "Life." Two volumes werecompleted, the first by Mr. Adams carrying the story to 1848, thesecond by myself for the period 1848 to 1860. For the third volume Ianalysed and organized the new materials obtained in England and we wereabout to begin actual collaboration on the most vital period of the"Life" when Mr. Adams died, and the work was indefinitely suspended,probably wisely, since any completion of the "Life" by me would havelacked that individual charm in historical writing so markedlycharacteristic of all that Mr. Adams did. The half-year spent with Mr.Adams was an inspiration and constitutes a precious memory.The Great War interrupted my own historical work, but in 1920 I returnedto the original plan of a work on "Great Britain and the American CivilWar" in the hope that the English materials obtained by Mr. Adams mightbe made available to me. When copies were secured by Mr. Adams in 1913 arestriction had been imposed by the Foreign Office to the effect thatwhile studied for information, citations and quotations were notpermissible since the general diplomatic archives were not yet open tostudents beyond the year 1859. Through my friend Sir Charles Lucas, thewhole matter was again presented to the Foreign Office, with an exactstatement that the new request was in no way related to the proposed"Life" of Charles Francis Adams, but was for my own use of thematerials. Lord Curzon, then Foreign Secretary, graciously approved therequest but with the usual condition that my manuscript be submittedbefore publication to the Foreign Office. This has now been done, and nosingle citation censored. Before this work will have appeared thelimitation hitherto imposed on diplomatic correspondence will have beenremoved, and the date for open research have been advanced beyond 1865,the end of the Civil War.Similar explanations of my purpose and proposed work were made throughmy friend Mr. Francis W. Hirst to the owners of various private papers,and prompt approval given. In 1924 I came to England for further studyof some of these private papers. The Russell Papers, transmitted to thePublic Record Office in 1914 and there preserved, were used through thecourtesy of the Executors of the late Hon. Rollo Russell, and with thehearty goodwill of Lady Agatha Russell, daughter of the late EarlRussell, the only living representative of her father, Mr. RolloRussell, his son, having died in 1914. The Lyons Papers, preserved inthe Muniment Room at Old Norfolk House, were used through the courtesyof the Duchess of Norfolk, who now represents her son who is a minor.The Gladstone Papers, preserved at Hawarden Castle, were used throughthe courtesy of the Gladstone Trustees. The few citations from thePalmerston Papers, preserved at Broadlands, were approved byLieut.-Colonel Wilfred Ashley, M.P.The opportunity to study these private papers has been invaluable for mywork. Shortly after returning from England in 1913 Mr. Worthington Fordwell said: "The inside history of diplomatic relations between theUnited States and Great Britain may be surmised from the officialarchives; the tinting and shading needed to complete the picture must besought elsewhere." (Mass. Hist. Soc. _Proceedings_, XLVI, p. 478.) Mr.C.F. Adams declared (_ibid._, XLVII, p. 54) that without these papers"... the character of English diplomacy at that time (1860-1865) cannotbe understood.... It would appear that the commonly entertainedimpressions as to certain phases of international relations, and theproceedings and utterances of English public men during the progress ofthe War of Secession, must be to some extent revised."In addition to the new English materials I have been fortunate in thegenerosity of my colleague at Stanford University, Professor Frank A.Golder, who has given to me transcripts, obtained at St. Petersburg in1914, of all Russian diplomatic correspondence on the Civil War. Manyfriends have aided, by suggestion or by permitting the use of notes andmanuscripts, in the preparation of this work. I have sought to make dueacknowledgment for such aid in my foot-notes. But in addition to thosealready named, I should here particularly note the courtesy of the lateMr. Gaillard Hunt for facilities given in the State Department atWashington, of Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, for thetranscript of the Correspondence of Mason and Slidell, ConfederateCommissioners in Europe, and of Mr. Charles Moore, Chief of ManuscriptsDivision, Library of Congress, for the use of the Schurz Paperscontaining copies of the despatches of Schleiden, Minister of theRepublic of Bremen at Washington during the Civil War. Especially thanksare due to my friend, Mr. Herbert Hoover, for his early interest in thiswork and for his generous aid in the making of transcripts which wouldotherwise have been beyond my means. And, finally, I owe much to theskill and care of my wife who made the entire typescript for the Press,and whose criticisms were invaluable.It is no purpose of a Preface to indicate results, but it is my hopethat with, I trust, a "calm comparison of the evidence," now for thefirst time available to the historian, a fairly true estimate may bemade of what the American Civil War meant to Great Britain; how sheregarded it and how she reacted to it. In brief, my work is primarily astudy in British history in the belief that the American drama had aworld significance, and peculiarly a British one.EPHRAIM DOUGLASS ADAMS._November 25, 1924_CONTENTS OF VOLUME ONECHAPTER                                                       PAGE   I.

Very different werethe views of Englishmen. The historian, George Grote, could write: "Theperfect neutrality [of Great Britain] in this destructive war appears tome almost a phenomenon in political history. No such forbearance hasbeen shown during the political history of the last two centuries. It isthe single case in which the English Government and public--generally someddlesome--have displayed most prudent and commendable forbearance inspite of great temptations to the contrary[2]." And Sir WilliamHarcourt, in September, 1863, declared: "Among all Lord Russell's manytitles to fame and to public gratitude, the manner in which he hassteered the vessel of State through the Scylla and Charybdis of theAmerican War will, I think, always stand conspicuous[3]."Minister Adams, in the later years of the Civil War, saw reason somewhatto modify his earlier judgment, but his indictment of Great Britain waslong prevalent in America, as, indeed, it was also among the historiansand writers of Continental Europe--notably those of France and Russia.To what extent was this dictum justified? Did Great Britain in spite ofher long years of championship of personal freedom and of leadership inthe cause of anti-slavery seize upon the opportunity offered in thedisruption of the American Union, and forgetting humanitarian idealisms,react only to selfish motives of commercial advantage and nationalpower? In brief, how is the American Civil War to be depicted byhistorians of Great Britain, recording her attitude and action in bothforeign and domestic policy, and revealing the principles of herstatesmen, or the inspirations of her people?It was to answer this question that the present work was originallyundertaken; but as investigation proceeded it became progressively moreclear that the great crisis in America was almost equally a crisis inthe domestic history of Great Britain itself and that unless this werefully appreciated no just estimate was possible of British policy towardAmerica. Still more it became evident that the American Civil War, asseen through British spectacles, could not be understood if regarded asan isolated and unique situation, but that the conditions preceding thatsituation--some of them lying far back in the relations of the twonations--had a vital bearing on British policy and opinion when thecrisis arose. No expanded examination of these preceding conditions ishere possible, but it is to a summary analysis of them that this firstchapter is devoted.       *       *       *       *       *On the American War for separation from the Mother Country it isunnecessary to dilate, though it should always be remembered that bothduring the war and afterwards there existed a minority in Great Britainstrongly sympathetic with the political ideals proclaimed inAmerica--regarding those ideals, indeed, as something to be striven forin Britain itself and the conflict with America as, in a measure, aconflict in home politics. But independence once acknowledged by theTreaty of Peace of 1783, the relations between the Mother Country andthe newly-created United States of America rapidly tended to adjustthemselves to lines of contact customary between Great Britain and anyother Sovereign State. Such contacts, fixing national attitude andpolicy, ordinarily occur on three main lines: governmental, determinedby officials in authority in either State whose duty it is to secure thegreatest advantage in power and prosperity for the State; commercial,resulting, primarily, from the interchange of goods and the businessopportunities of either nation in the other's territory, or from theirrivalry in foreign trade; idealistic, the result of comparativedevelopment especially in those ideals of political structure whichdetermine the nature of the State and the form of its government. Themore obvious of these contacts is the governmental, since the attitudeof a people is judged by the formal action of its Government, and,indeed, in all three lines of contact the government of a State isdirectly concerned and frequently active. But it may be of service to aclearer appreciation of British attitude and policy before 1860, if theintermingling of elements required by a strict chronological account ofrelations is here replaced by a separate review of each of the threemain lines of contact.Once independence had been yielded to the American Colonies, theinterest of the British Government rapidly waned in affairs American.True, there still remained the valued establishments in the West Indies,and the less considered British possessions on the continent to thenorth of the United States. Meanwhile, there were occasional frictionswith America arising from uncertain claims drawn from the formercolonial privileges of the new state, or from boundary contentions notsettled in the treaty of peace. Thus the use of the Newfoundlandfisheries furnished ground for an acrimonious controversy lasting eveninto the twentieth century, and occasionally rising to the danger point.Boundary disputes dragged along through official argument, surveycommissions, arbitration, to final settlement, as in the case of thenorthern limits of the State of Maine fixed at last by the Treaty ofWashington of 1842, and then on lines fair to both sides at any time inthe forty years of legal bickering. Very early, in 1817, an agreementcreditable to the wisdom and pacific intentions of both countries, wasreached establishing small and equal naval armaments on the Great Lakes.The British fear of an American attack on Canada proved groundless astime went on and was definitely set at rest by the strict curb placed bythe American Government upon the restless activities of such of itscitizens as sympathized with the followers of McKenzie and Papineau inthe Canadian rebellion of 1837[4].None of these governmental contacts affected greatly the British policytoward America. But the "War of 1812," as it is termed in the UnitedStates, "Mr. Madison's War," as it was derisively named by Torycontemporaries in Great Britain, arose from serious policies in whichthe respective governments were in definite opposition. Briefly, thiswas a clash between belligerent and neutral interests. Britain, fightingat first for the preservation of Europe against the spread of Frenchrevolutionary influence, later against the Napoleonic plan of Empire,held the seas in her grasp and exercised with vigour all the accustomedrights of a naval belligerent. Of necessity, from her point of view,and as always in the case of the dominant naval belligerent, shestretched principles of international law to their utmost interpretationto secure her victory in war. America, soon the only maritime neutral ofimportance, and profiting greatly by her neutrality, contested point bypoint the issue of exceeded belligerent right as established ininternational law. America did more; she advanced new rules and theoriesof belligerent and neutral right respectively, and demanded that thebelligerents accede to them. Dispute arose over blockades, contraband,the British "rule of 1756" which would have forbidden American tradewith French colonies in war time, since such trade was prohibited byFrance herself in time of peace. But first and foremost as touching thepersonal sensibilities and patriotism of both countries was the Britishexercise of a right of search and seizure to recover British sailors.Moreover this asserted right brought into clear view definitely opposedtheories as to citizenship. Great Britain claimed that a man once born aBritish subject could never cease to be a subject--could never "alienatehis duty." It was her practice to fill up her navy, in part at least, bythe "impressment" of her sailor folk, taking them whenever needed, andwherever found--in her own coast towns, or from the decks of her ownmercantile marine. But many British sailors sought security from suchimpressment by desertion in American ports or were tempted to desert toAmerican merchant ships by the high pay obtainable in therapidly-expanding United States merchant marine. Many became bynaturalization citizens of the United States, and it was the duty ofAmerica to defend them as such in their lives and business. Americaultimately came to hold, in short, that expatriation was accomplishedfrom Great Britain when American citizenship was conferred. On shorethey were safe, for Britain did not attempt to reclaim her subjectsfrom the soil of another nation. But she denied that the American flagon merchant vessels at sea gave like security and she asserted a navalright to search such vessels in time of peace, professing her completeacquiescence in a like right to the American navy over British merchantvessels--a concession refused by America, and of no practical valuesince no American citizen sought service in the British merchant marine.This "right of search" controversy involved then, two basic points ofopposition between the two governments. First America contested theBritish theory of "once a citizen always a citizen[5]"; second, Americadenied any right whatever to a foreign naval vessel in _time of peace_to stop and search a vessel lawfully flying the American flag. The_right of search in time of war_, that is, a belligerent right ofsearch, America never denied, but there was both then and later muchpublic confusion in both countries as to the question at issue since,once at war, Great Britain frequently exercised a legal belligerentright of search and followed it up by the seizure of sailors alleged tobe British subjects. Nor were British naval captains especially carefulto make sure that no American-born sailors were included in theirimpressment seizures, and as the accounts spread of victim after victim,the American irritation steadily increased. True, France was also anoffender, but as the weaker naval power her offence was lost sight of inview of the, literally, thousands of _bona fide_ Americans seized byGreat Britain. Here, then, was a third cause of irritation connectedwith impressment, though not a point of governmental dispute as toright, for Great Britain professed her earnest desire to restorepromptly any American-born sailors whom her naval officers had seizedthrough error. In fact many such sailors were soon liberated, but alarge number either continued to serve on British ships or to languishin British prisons until the end of the Napoleonic Wars[6].There were other, possibly greater, causes of the War of 1812, most ofthem arising out of the conflicting interests of the chief maritimeneutral and the chief naval belligerent. The pacific presidentialadministration of Jefferson sought by trade restrictions, using embargoand non-intercourse acts, to bring pressure on both England and France,hoping to force a better treatment of neutrals. The United States,divided in sympathy between the belligerents, came near to disorder anddisruption at home, over the question of foreign policy. But through allAmerican factions there ran the feeling of growing animosity to GreatBritain because of impressment. At last, war was declared by America in1812 and though at the moment bitterly opposed by one section, NewEngland, that war later came to be regarded as of great national valueas one of the factors which welded the discordant states into a nationalunity. Naturally also, the war once ended, its commercial causes werequickly forgotten, whereas the individual, personal offence involved inimpressment and right of search, with its insult to national pride,became a patriotic theme for politicians and for the press. To deny, infact, a British "right of search" became a national point of honour,upon which no American statesman would have dared to yield to Britishovertures.In American eyes the War of 1812 appears as a "second war ofIndependence" and also as of international importance in contesting anunjust use by Britain of her control of the seas. Also, it is to beremembered that no other war of importance was fought by America untilthe Mexican War of 1846, and militant patriotism was thus centred on thetwo wars fought against Great Britain. The contemporary British viewwas that of a nation involved in a life and death struggle with a greatEuropean enemy, irritated by what seemed captious claims, developed towar, by a minor power[7]. To be sure there were a few obstinate Toriesin Britain who saw in the war the opportunity of smashing at one blowNapoleon's dream of empire, and the American "democratic system." TheLondon _Times_ urged the government to "finish with Mr. Bonaparte andthen deal with Mr. Madison and democracy," arguing that it should beEngland's object to subvert "the whole system of the Jeffersonianschool." But this was not the purpose of the British Government, norwould such a purpose have been tolerated by the small but vigorous Whigminority in Parliament.The peace of 1814, signed at Ghent, merely declared an end of the war,quietly ignoring all the alleged causes of the conflict. Impressment wasnot mentioned, but it was never again resorted to by Great Britain uponAmerican ships. But the principle of right of search in time of peace,though for another object than impressment, was soon again asserted byGreat Britain and for forty years was a cause of constant irritation anda source of danger in the relations of the two countries. Stirred byphilanthropic emotion Great Britain entered upon a world crusade for thesuppression of the African Slave Trade. All nations in principlerepudiated that trade and Britain made treaties with various maritimepowers giving mutual right of search to the naval vessels of each uponthe others' merchant vessels. The African Slave Trade was in factoutlawed for the flags of all nations. But America, smarting under thememory of impressment injuries, and maintaining in any case the doctrinethat in time of peace the national flag protected a vessel frominterference or search by the naval vessels of any other power, refusedto sign mutual right of search treaties and denied, absolutely, such aright for any cause whatever to Great Britain or to any other nation.Being refused a treaty, Britain merely renewed her assertion of theright and continued to exercise it.Thus the right of search in time of peace controversy was not ended withthe war of 1812 but remained a constant sore in national relations, forBritain alone used her navy with energy to suppress the slave trade, andthe slave traders of all nations sought refuge, when approached by aBritish naval vessel, under the protection of the American flag. IfBritain respected the flag, and sheered off from search, how could shestop the trade? If she ignored the flag and on boarding found aninnocent American vessel engaged in legal trade, there resulted claimsfor damages by detention of voyage, and demands by the AmericanGovernment for apology and reparation. The real slave trader, seizedunder the American flag, never protested to the United States, norclaimed American citizenship, for his punishment in American law forengaging in the slave trade was death, while under the law of any othernation it did not exceed imprisonment, fine and loss of his vessel.Summed up in terms of governmental attitude the British contention wasthat here was a great international humanitarian object frustrated by anabsurd American sensitiveness on a point of honour about the flag. Afterfifteen years of dispute Great Britain offered to abandon any claim to aright of _search_, contenting herself with a right of _visit_, merely toverify a vessel's right to fly the American flag. America asserted thisto be mere pretence, involving no renunciation of a practice whoselegality she denied. In 1842, in the treaty settling the Maine boundarycontroversy, the eighth article sought a method of escape. Jointcruising squadrons were provided for the coast of Africa, the Britishto search all suspected vessels except those flying the American flag,and these to be searched by the American squadron. At once PresidentTyler notified Congress that Great Britain had renounced the right ofsearch. Immediately in Parliament a clamour was raised against theGovernment for the "sacrifice" of a British right at sea, and LordAberdeen promptly made official disclaimer of such surrender.Thus, heritage of the War of 1812 right of search in time of peace was asteady irritant. America doubted somewhat the honesty of Great Britain,appreciating in part the humanitarian purpose, but suspicious of anulterior "will to rule the seas." After 1830 no American politicalleader would have dared to yield the right of search. Great Britain forher part, viewing the expansion of domestic slavery in the UnitedStates, came gradually to attribute the American contention, not topatriotic pride, but to the selfish business interests of theslave-holding states. In the end, in 1858, with a waning Britishenthusiasm for the cause of slave trade suppression, and withrecognition that America had become a great world power, Britain yieldedher claim to right of search or visit, save when established by Treaty.Four years later, in 1862, it may well have seemed to British statesmenthat American slavery had indeed been the basic cause of America'sattitude, for in that year a treaty was signed by the two nations givingmutual right of search for the suppression of the African Slave Trade.In fact, however, this was but an effort by Seward, Secretary of Statefor the North, to influence British and European opinion against theseceding slave states of the South.The right of search controversy was, in truth, ended when American powerreached a point where the British Government must take it seriously intoaccount as a factor in general world policy. That power had beensteadily and rapidly advancing since 1814. From almost the first momentof established independence American statesmen visualized theseparation of the interests of the western continent from those ofEurope, and planned for American leadership in this new world.Washington, the first President, emphasized in his farewell address thedanger of entangling alliances with Europe. For long the nations ofEurope, immersed in Continental wars, put aside their rivalries in thisnew world. Britain, for a time, neglected colonial expansion westward,but in 1823, in an emergency of European origin when France,commissioned by the great powers of continental Europe, intervened inSpain to restore the deposed Bourbon monarchy and seemed about tointervene in Spanish America to restore to Spain her revolted colonies,there developed in Great Britain a policy, seemingly about to drawAmerica and England into closer co-operation. Canning, for Britain,proposed to America a joint declaration against French intervention inthe Americas. His argument was against the principle of intervention;his immediate motive was a fear of French colonial expansion; but hisultimate object was inheritance by Britain of Spain's dying influenceand position in the new world.Canning's overture was earnestly considered in America. Theex-Presidents, Jefferson and Madison, recommended its acceptance, butthe Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, opposed this, favouringrather a separate declaration by the United States, and of this opinionwas also President Monroe. Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine announcingAmerican opposition to the principle of "intervention," and declaringthat the American continents were no longer to be regarded as open tofurther colonization by European nations. The British emergencysituation with France, though already quieted, caused Monroe's Messageto be greeted in England with high approval. But Canning did not soapprove it for he saw clearly that the Monroe Doctrine was a challengenot merely to continental Europe, but to England as well and he sethimself to thwart this threatening American policy. Had Canning's policybeen followed by later British statesmen there would have resulted aserious clash with the United States[8].In fact the Monroe Doctrine, imposing on Europe a self-denying policy ofnon-colonial expansion toward the west, provided for the United Statesthe medium, if she wished to use it, for her own expansion in territoryand in influence. But for a time there was no need of additionalterritory for that already hers stretched from the Atlantic to the RockyMountains, two-thirds of the way from ocean to ocean. Her population wasgrowing fast. But four millions at the time of the Revolution, therewere thirteen millions in 1830, and of these nearly a third were alreadyacross the Appalachian range and were constantly pressing on towards newlands in the South and West. The Monroe Doctrine was the first definitenotice given to Europe of America's preconceived "destiny," but theearlier realization of that destiny took place on lines of expansionwithin her own boundaries. To this there could be no governmentalobjection, whether by Great Britain or any other nation.But when in the decade 1840 to 1850, the United States, to the view ofBritish statesmen, suddenly startled the world by entering upon a policyof further territorial expansion, forsaking her peaceful progress andturning toward war, there was a quick determination on a line of Britishpolicy as regards the American advance. The first intimation of the newAmerican policy came in relation to the State of Texas which hadrevolted from Mexico in 1836, and whose independence had been generallyrecognized by 1842. To this new state Britain sent diplomatic andconsular agents and these reported two factions among the people--oneseeking admission to the American Union, one desiring the maintenanceof independence.In 1841 Aberdeen had sent Lord Ashburton to America with instructions tosecure, if possible, a settlement of all matters in dispute. Here was agenuine British effort to escape from national irritations. But beforethe Treaty of 1842 was signed, even while it was in the earlier stagesof negotiation, the British Government saw, with alarm, quite newquestions arising, preventing, to its view, that harmonious relationwith the United States the desire for which had led to the Ashburtonmission. This new development was the appearance of an American feverfor territorial expansion, turning first toward Texas, but soon voicedas a "manifest destiny" which should carry American power andinstitutions to the Pacific and even into Central America. Among theseinstitutions was that of slavery, detested by the public of GreatBritain, yet a delicate matter for governmental consideration since thegreat cotton manufacturing interests drew the bulk of their supplies ofraw cotton from the slave-holding states of America. If Texas, herself acotton state, should join the United States, dependence upon slave-growncotton would be intensified. Also, Texas, once acquired, what was thereto prevent further American exploitation, followed by slave expansion,into Mexico, where for long British influence had been dominant?On the fate of Texas, therefore, centred for a time the whole Britishpolicy toward America. Pakenham, the British minister to Mexico, urged aBritish pressure on Mexico to forgo her plans of reconquering Texas, andstrong British efforts to encourage Texas in maintaining herindependence. His theory foreshadowed a powerful buffer Anglo-Saxonstate, prohibiting American advance to the south-west, releasing Britainfrom dependence on American cotton, and ultimately, he hoped, leadingTexas to abolish slavery, not yet so rooted as to be ineradicable. Thispolicy was approved by the British Government, Pakenham was sent toWashington to watch events, a _charge_, Elliot, was despatched to Texas,and from London lines were cast to draw France into the plan and toforce the acquiescence of Mexico.In this brief account of main lines of governmental contacts, it isunnecessary to recite the details of the diplomatic conflict, for suchit became, with sharp antagonisms manifested on both sides. The basicfact was that America was bent upon territorial expansion, and thatGreat Britain set herself to thwart this ambition. But not to the pointof war. Aberdeen was so incautious at one moment as to propose to Franceand Mexico a triple guarantee of the independence of Texas, if thatstate would acquiesce, but when Pakenham notified him that in this case,Britain must clearly understand that war with America was not merelypossible, but probable, Aberdeen hastened to withdraw the plan ofguarantee, fortunately not yet approved by Mexico[9].The solution of this diplomatic contest thus rested with Texas. Did shewish annexation to the United States, or did she prefer independence?Elliot, in Texas, hoped to the last moment that Texas would chooseindependence and British favour. But the people of the new state werelargely emigrants from the United States, and a majority of them wishedto re-enter the Union, a step finally accomplished in 1846, after tenyears of separate existence as a Republic. The part played by theBritish Government in this whole episode was not a fortunate one. It isthe duty of Governments to watch over the interests of their subjects,and to guard the prestige and power of the state. Great Britain had aperfect _right_ to take whatever steps she chose to take in regard toTexas, but the steps taken appeared to Americans to be based upon apolicy antagonistic to the American expansion policy of the moment. TheGovernment of Great Britain appeared, indeed, to have adopted a policyof preventing the development of the power of the United States. Then,fronted with war, she had meekly withdrawn. The basic British publicfeeling, fixing the limits of governmental policy, of never again beingdrawn into war with America, not because of fear, but because ofimportant trade relations and also because of essential liking andadmiration, in spite of surface antagonisms, was not appreciated inAmerica. Lord Aberdeen indeed, and others in governmental circles,pleaded that the support of Texan independence was in reality perfectlyin harmony with the best interests of the United States, since it wouldhave tended toward the limitation of American slavery. And in the matterof national power, they consoled themselves with prophecies that theAmerican Union, now so swollen in size, must inevitably split into two,perhaps three, rival empires, a slave-holding one in the South, freenations in North and West.The fate of Texas sealed, Britain soon definitely abandoned allopposition to American expansion unless it were to be attemptednorthwards, though prophesying evil for the American madness. Mexico,relying on past favours, and because of a sharp controversy between theUnited States and Great Britain over the Oregon territory, expectedBritish aid in her war of 1846 against America. But she was sharplywarned that such aid would not be given, and the Oregon dispute wassettled in the Anglo-Saxon fashion of vigorous legal argument, followedby a fair compromise. The Mexican war resulted in the acquisition ofCalifornia by the United States. British agents in this province ofMexico, and British admirals on the Pacific were cautioned to take noactive steps in opposition.Thus British policy, after Texan annexation, offered no barrier toAmerican expansion, and much to British relief the fear of the extensionof the American plans to Mexico and Central America was not realized.The United States was soon plunged, as British statesmen had prophesied,into internal conflict over the question whether the newly-acquiredterritories should be slave or free.The acquisition of California brought up a new problem of quick transitbetween Atlantic and Pacific, and a canal was planned across CentralAmerica. Here Britain and America acted together, at first in amity,though the convention signed in 1850 later developed discord as to theBritish claim of a protectorate over the Atlantic end of the proposedcanal at San Juan del Nicaragua. But Britain was again at war in Europein the middle 'fifties, and America was deep in quarrel over slavery athome. On both sides in spite of much diplomatic intrigue and ofmanifestations of national pride there was governmental desire to avoiddifficulties. At the end of the ten-year period Britain ceded toNicaragua her protectorate in the canal zone, and all causes offriction, so reported President Buchanan to Congress in 1860, werehappily removed. Britain definitely altered her policy of opposition tothe growth of American power.In 1860, then, the causes of governmental antagonisms were seemingly allat an end. Impressment was not used after 1814. The differing theoriesof the two Governments on British expatriation still remained, butBritain attempted no practical application of her view. The right ofsearch in time of peace controversy, first eased by the plan of jointcruising, had been definitely settled by the British renunciation of1858. Opposition to American territorial advance but briefly manifestedby Britain, had ended with the annexation of Texas, and the fever ofexpansion had waned in America. Minor disputes in Central America,related to the proposed canal, were amicably adjusted.But differences between nations, varying view-points of peoples,frequently have deeper currents than the more obvious frictions ingovernmental act or policy, nor can governments themselves fail to reactto such less evident causes. It is necessary to review the commercialrelations of the two nations--later to examine their political ideals.In 1783 America won her independence in government from a colonialstatus. But commercially she remained a British colony--yet with adifference. She had formed a part of the British colonial system. Allher normal trade was with the mother country or with other Britishcolonies. Now her privileges in such trade were at an end, and she mustseek as a favour that which had formerly been hers as a member of theBritish Empire. The direct trade between England and America was easilyand quickly resumed, for the commercial classes of both nations desiredit and profited by it. But the British colonial system prohibited tradebetween a foreign state and British colonies and there was one channelof trade, to and from the British West Indies, long very profitable toboth sides, during colonial times, but now legally hampered by Americanindependence. The New England States had lumber, fish, and farm productsdesired by the West Indian planters, and these in turn offered neededsugar, molasses, and rum. Both parties desired to restore the trade, andin spite of the legal restrictions of the colonial system, the trade wasin fact resumed in part and either permitted or winked at by the BritishGovernment, but never to the advantageous exchange of former times.The acute stage of controversy over West Indian trade was not reacheduntil some thirty years after American Independence, but the uncertaintyof such trade during a long period in which a portion of it consistedin unauthorized and unregulated exchange was a constant irritant to allparties concerned. Meanwhile there came the War of 1812 with itspreliminary check upon direct trade to and from Great Britain, and itsfinal total prohibition of intercourse during the war itself. In 1800the bulk of American importation of manufactures still came from GreatBritain. In the contest over neutral rights and theories, Jeffersonattempted to bring pressure on the belligerents, and especially onEngland, by restriction of imports. First came a non-importation Act,1806, followed by an embargo on exports, 1807, but these were sounpopular in the commercial states of New England that they werewithdrawn in 1810, yet for a short time only, for Napoleon tricked theUnited States into believing that France had yielded to Americancontentions on neutral rights, and in 1811 non-intercourse wasproclaimed again with England alone. On June 18, 1812, America finallydeclared war and trade stopped save in a few New England ports whererebellious citizens continued to sell provisions to a blockading Britishnaval squadron.For eight years after 1806, then, trade with Great Britain had steadilydecreased, finally almost to extinction during the war. But Americarequired certain articles customarily imported and necessity now forcedher to develop her own manufactures. New England had been the centre ofAmerican foreign commerce, but now there began a trend towardmanufacturing enterprise. Even in 1814, however, at the end of the war,it was still thought in the United States that under normal conditionsmanufactured goods would again be imported and the general cry of"protection for home industries" was as yet unvoiced. Nevertheless, agroup of infant industries had in fact been started and clamoured fordefence now that peace was restored. This situation was not unnoticed inGreat Britain where merchants, piling up goods in anticipation of peaceon the continent of Europe and a restored market, suddenly discoveredthat the poverty of Europe denied them that market. Looking withapprehension toward the new industries of America, British merchants,following the advice of Lord Brougham in a parliamentary speech, dumpedgreat quantities of their surplus goods on the American market, sellingthem far below cost, or even on extravagant credit terms. One object wasto smash the budding American manufactures.This action of British merchants naturally stirred some angry patrioticemotions in the circles where American business suffered and a demandbegan to be heard for protection. But the Government of the UnitedStates was still representative of agriculture, in the main, and while aTariff Bill was enacted in 1816 that Bill was regarded as a temporarymeasure required by the necessity of paying the costs of the recent war.Just at this juncture, however, British policy, now looking again towarda great colonial empire, sought advantages for the hitherto neglectedmaritime provinces of British North America, and thought that it hadfound them by encouragement of their trade with the British West Indies.The legal status of American trade with the West Indies was now enforcedand for a time intercourse was practically suspended.This British policy brought to the front the issue of protection inAmerica. It not only worked against a return by New England frommanufacturing to commerce, but it soon brought into the ranks ofprotectionists a northern and western agricultural element that had beenaccustomed to sell surplus products to West Indian planters seekingcheap food-stuffs for their slaves. This new protectionist element wasas yet not crystallized into a clamour for "home markets" foragriculture, but the pressure of opinion was beginning to be felt, andby 1820 the question of West Indian trade became one of constantagitation and demanded political action. That action was taken on linesof retaliation. Congress in 1818 passed a law excluding from Americanports any British vessel coming from a port access to which was deniedto an American vessel, and placing under bond in American ports Britishvessels with prohibition of their proceeding to a British port to whichAmerican vessels could not go. This act affected not merely direct tradewith the West Indies, but stopped the general custom of British ships oftaking part cargoes to Jamaica while _en route_ to and from the UnitedStates. The result was, first, compromise, later, under Huskisson'sadministration at the British Board of Trade, complete abandonment byBritain of the exclusive trade basis of her whole colonial system.The "retaliatory system" which J.Q. Adams regarded as "a new declarationof independence," was, in fact, quickly taken up by other non-colonialnations, and these, with America, compelled Great Britain to take stockof her interests. Huskisson, rightly foreseeing British prosperity asdependent upon her manufactures and upon the carrying trade, stated inParliament that American "retaliation" had forced the issue. Freedom oftrade in British ports was offered in 1826 to all non-colonial nationsthat would open their ports within one year on terms of equality toBritish ships. J.Q. Adams, now President of the United States, delayedacceptance of this offer, preferring a treaty negotiation, and wasrebuffed by Canning, so that actual resumption of West Indian trade didnot take place until 1830, after the close of Adams' administration.That trade never recovered its former prosperity.Meanwhile the long period of controversy, from 1806 to 1830, hadresulted in a complete change in the American situation. It is not asufficient explanation of the American belief in, and practice of, thetheory of protection to attribute this alone to British checks placedupon free commercial rivalry. Nevertheless the progress of Americatoward an established system, reaching its highest mark for years in theTariff Bill of 1828, is distinctly related to the events just narrated.After American independence, the partially illegal status of West Indiantrade hampered commercial progress and slightly encouraged Americanmanufactures by the mere seeking of capital for investment; the neutraltroubles of 1806 and the American prohibitions on intercourse increasedthe transfer of interest; the war of 1812 gave a complete protection toinfant industries; the dumping of British goods in 1815 stirredpatriotic American feeling; British renewal of colonial systemrestrictions, and the twelve-year quarrel over "retaliation" gave timefor the definite establishment of protectionist ideas in the UnitedStates. But Britain was soon proclaiming for herself and for the worldthe common advantage and the justice of a great theory of free trade.America was apparently now committed to an opposing economic theory, thefirst great nation definitely to establish it, and thus there resulted aclear-cut opposition of principle and a clash of interests. From 1846,when free trade ideas triumphed in England, the devoted British freetrader regarded America as the chief obstacle to a world-wide acceptanceof his theory.The one bright spot in America, as regarded by the British free trader,was in the Southern States, where cotton interests, desiring noadvantage from protection, since their market was in Europe, attackedAmerican protection and sought to escape from it. Also slave supplies,without protection, could have been purchased more cheaply from Englandthan from the manufacturing North. In 1833 indeed the South had forced areaction against protection, but it proceeded slowly. In 1854 it wasSouthern opinion that carried through Congress the reciprocity treatywith the British American Provinces, partly brought about, no doubt, bya Southern fear that Canada, bitter over the loss of special advantagesin British markets by the British free trade of 1846, might join theUnited States and thus swell the Northern and free states of the Union.Cotton interests and trade became the dominant British commercial tiewith the United States, and the one great hope, to the British minds, ofa break in the false American system of protection. Thus both ineconomic theory and in trade, spite of British dislike of slavery, theexport trading interests of Great Britain became more and more directedtoward the Southern States of America. Adding powerfully to this was thedependence of British cotton manufactures upon the American supply. TheBritish trade attitude, arising largely outside of direct governmentalcontacts, was bound to have, nevertheless, a constant and importantinfluence on governmental action.Governmental policy, seeking national power, conflicting trade andindustrial interests, are the favourite themes of those historians whoregard nations as determined in their relations solely by economiccauses--by what is called "enlightened self-interest." But governments,no matter how arbitrary, and still more if in a measure resting onrepresentation, react both consciously and unconsciously to a publicopinion not obviously based upon either national or commercial rivalry.Sometimes, indeed, governmental attitude runs absolutely counter topopular attitude in international affairs. In such a case, thehistorical estimate, if based solely on evidences of governmentalaction, is a false one and may do great injustice to the essentialfriendliness of a people.How then, did the British people, of all classes, regard America before1860, and in what manner did that regard affect the British Government?Here, it is necessary to seek British opinion on, and its reaction to,American institutions, ideals, and practices. Such public opinion canbe found in quantity sufficient to base an estimate only in travellers'books, in reviews, and in newspapers of the period. When all these arebrought together it is found that while there was an almost universalBritish criticism of American social customs and habits of life, due tothat insularity of mental attitude characteristic of every nation,making it prefer its own customs and criticize those of its neighbours,summed up in the phrase "dislike of foreigners"--it is found thatBritish opinion was centred upon two main threads; first America as aplace for emigration and, second, American political ideals andinstitutions[10].British emigration to America, a governmentally favoured colonizationprocess before the American revolution, lost that favour after 1783,though not at first definitely opposed. But emigration still continuedand at no time, save during the war of 1812, was it absolutely stopped.Its exact amount is unascertainable, for neither Government keptadequate statistics before 1820. With the end of the Napoleonic warsthere came great distress in England from which the man of energy soughtescape. He turned naturally to America, being familiar, by hearsay atleast, with stories of the ease of gaining a livelihood there, andinfluenced by the knowledge that in the United States he would findpeople of his own blood and speech. The bulk of this earlier emigrationto America resulted from economic causes. When, in 1825, one energeticMember of Parliament, Wilmot Horton, induced the Government to appoint acommittee to investigate the whole subject, the result was a mass oftestimony, secured from returned emigrants or from their letters home,in which there constantly appeared one main argument influencing thelabourer type of emigrant; he got good wages, and he was supplied, as afarm hand, with good food. Repeatedly he testifies that he had "threemeat meals a day," whereas in England he had ordinarily received but onesuch meal a week.Mere good living was the chief inducement for the labourer type ofemigrant, and the knowledge of such living created for this typeremaining in England a sort of halo of industrial prosperity surroundingAmerica. But there was a second testimony brought out by Horton'sCommittee, less general, yet to be picked up here and there as evidenceof another argument for emigration to America. The labourer did notdilate upon political equality, nor boast of a share in government,indeed generally had no such share, but he did boast to his fellows athome of the social equality, though not thus expressing it, which wasall about him. He was a common farm hand, yet he "sat down to meals"with his employer and family, and worked in the fields side by side withhis "master." This, too, was an astounding difference to the mind of theBritish labourer. Probably for him it created a clearer, if notaltogether universal and true picture of the meaning of Americandemocracy than would have volumes of writing upon politicalinstitutions. Gradually there was established in the lower orders ofBritish society a visualization of America as a haven of physicalwell-being and personal social happiness.This British labouring class had for long, however, no medium ofexpression in print. Here existed, then, an unexpressed public opinionof America, of much latent influence, but for the moment largelynegligible as affecting other classes or the Government. A moreimportant emigrating class in its influence on opinion at home, thoughnot a large class, was composed about equally of small farmers and smallmerchants facing ruin in the agricultural and trading crises thatfollowed the end of the European war. The British travellers' booksfrom 1810 to 1820 are generally written by men of this class, or byagents sent out from co-operative groups planning emigration. Generallythey were discontented with political conditions at home, commonlyopposed to a petrified social order, and attracted to the United Statesby its lure of prosperity and content. The books are, in brief, asuperior type of emigrant guide for a superior type of emigrant,examining and emphasizing industrial opportunity.Almost universally, however, they sound the note of superior politicalinstitutions and conditions. One wrote "A republican finds here ARepublic, and the only Republic on the face of the earth that everdeserved the name: where all are under the protection of equal laws; oflaws made by Themselves[11]." Another, who established an English colonyin the Western States of Illinois, wrote of England that he objected to"being ruled and taxed by people who had no more right to rule and taxus than consisted in the power to do it." And of his adopted country heconcludes: "I love the Government; and thus a novel sensation isexcited; it is like the development of a new faculty. I am become apatriot in my old age[12]." Still another detailed the points of hiscontent, "I am here, lord and master of myself and of 100 acres ofland--an improvable farm, little trouble to me, good society and a goodmarket, and, I think, a fine climate, only a little too hot and dry insummer; the parson gets nothing from me; my state and road taxes andpoor rates amount to Sec.25.00 per annum. I can carry a gun if I choose; Ileave my door unlocked at night; and I can get snuff for one cent anounce or a little more[13]."From the first days of the American colonial movement towardindependence there had been, indeed, a British interest in Americanpolitical principles. Many Whigs sympathized with these principles forreasons of home political controversy. Their sympathy continued afterAmerican independence and by its insistent expression brought outequally insistent opposition from Tory circles. The British homemovement toward a more representative Government had been temporarilychecked by the extremes into which French Liberalism plunged in 1791,causing reaction in England. By 1820 pressure was again being exerted byBritish Liberals of intelligence, and they found arguments in suchreports as those just quoted. From that date onward, and especially justbefore the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832, yet always a factor, theexample of a prosperous American democracy was an element in Britishhome politics, lauded or derided as the man in England desired or not anexpansion of the British franchise. In the earlier period, however, itis to be remembered that applause of American institutions did not meanacceptance of democracy to the extent of manhood franchise, for no suchfranchise at first existed in America itself. The debate in England wassimply whether the step forward in American democracy, was an argumentfor a similar step in Great Britain.Books, reviews and newspapers in Great Britain as the political quarrelthere grew in force, depicted America favourably or otherwise accordingto political sympathies at home. Both before and after the Reform Billof 1832 this type of effort to mould opinion, by citation of America,was widespread. Hence there is in such writing, not so much theexpression of public opinion, as of propaganda to affect that opinion.Book upon book, review upon review, might be quoted to illustrate this,but a few notable examples will suffice.The most widely read and reviewed book on the United States before1840, except the humorous and flippant characterization of America byMrs. Trollope, was Captain Basil Hall's three-volume work, published in1829[14]. Claiming an open mind, he expected for his adverse findings areadier credence. For adverse to American political institutions thesefindings are in all their larger applications. In every line Hallbetrays himself as an old Tory of the 'twenties, fixed in his belief,and convinced of the perfection and unalterableness of the BritishConstitution. Captain Hamilton, who wrote in 1833, was more frank inavowal of a purpose[15]. He states in his preface:     "... When I found the institutions and experiences of the     United States deliberately quoted in the reformed parliament,     as affording safe precedent for British legislation, and     learned that the drivellers who uttered such nonsense,     instead of encountering merited derision, were listened to     with patience and approbation by men as ignorant as     themselves, I certainly did feel that another work on America     was yet wanted, and at once determined to undertake a task     which inferior considerations would probably have induced me     to decline."Harriet Martineau, ardent advocate of political reform at home, found inthe United States proofs for her faith in democracy[16]. Captain Marryatbelittled Miss Martineau, but in his six volumes proved himself less acritic of America than an enemy of democracy. Answering a review of hisearlier volumes, published separately, he wrote in his concludingvolume: "I candidly acknowledge that the reviewer is right in hissupposition; my great object has been to do serious injury to the causeof democracy[17]."The fact was that British governing and intellectual classes weresuffering a recoil from the enthusiasms leading up to the step towarddemocracy in the Reform of 1832. The electoral franchise was stilllimited to a small minority of the population. Britain was still ruledby her "wise men" of wealth and position. Meanwhile, however, just atthe moment when dominant Whig influence in England carried through thatstep forward toward democratic institutions which Whigs had long laudedin America, the latter country had progressed to manhood suffrage, or asnearly all leading Englishmen, whether Whig or Tory, regarded it, hadplunged into the rule of the mob. The result was a rapid lessening inWhig ruling-class expression of admiration for America, even before longto the complete cessation of such admiration, and to assertions in GreatBritain that the Reform of 1832 was "final," the last step towarddemocracy which Britain could safely take. It is not strange that thebooks and reviews of the period from 1830 to 1840, heavily stress thedangers and crudity of American democracy. They were written for whatwas now a nearly unanimous British reading public, fearful lest Radicalpressure for still further electoral reform should preach the example ofthe United States.Thus after 1832 the previous sympathy for America of one section of theBritish governing class disappears. More--it is replaced by a critical,if not openly hostile attitude. Soon, with the rapid development of thepower and wealth of the United States, governing-class England, of allfactions save the Radical, came to view America just as it would haveviewed any other rising nation, that is, as a problem to be studied forits influence on British prosperity and power. Again, expressions inprint reflect the changes of British view--nowhere more clearly than intravellers' books. After 1840, for nearly a decade, these are devoted,not to American political institutions, but to studies, many of themvery careful ones, of American industry and governmental policy.Buckingham, one-time member of Parliament, wrote nine volumes of suchdescription. His work is a storehouse of fact, useful to this day to theAmerican historical student[18]. George Combe, philosopher andphrenologist, studied especially social institutions[19]. Joseph Sturge,philanthropist and abolitionist, made a tour, under the guidance of thepoet Whittier, through the Northern and Eastern States[20].Featherstonaugh, a scientist and civil engineer, described the Southernslave states, in terms completely at variance with those of Sturge[21].Kennedy, traveller in Texas, and later British consul at Galveston, andWarburton, a traveller who came to the United States by way of Canada,an unusual approach, were both frankly startled, the latter professedlyalarmed, at the evidences of power in America[22]. Amazed at the energy,growth and prosperity of the country and alarmed at the anti-Britishfeeling he found in New York City, Warburton wrote that "they[Americans] only wait for matured power to apply the incendiary torch ofRepublicanism to the nations of Europe[23]." Soon after this was writtenthere began, in 1848, that great tide of Irish emigration to Americawhich heavily reinforced the anti-British attitude of the City of NewYork, and largely changed its character.Did books dilating upon the expanding power of America reflect Britishpublic opinion, or did they create it? It is difficult to estimate suchmatters. Certainly it is not uninteresting that these books coincided inpoint of time with a British governmental attitude of opposition, thoughon peaceful lines, to the development of American power, and to theadoption to the point of faith, by British commercial classes, of freetrade as opposed to the American protective system. But governingclasses were not the British public, and to the great unenfranchisedmass, finding voice through the writings of a few leaders, theprosperity of America made a powerful appeal. Radical democracy wasagain beginning to make its plea in Britain. In 1849 there was publisheda study of the United States, more careful and exact than any previousto Bryce's great work, and lauding American political institutions. Thiswas Mackay's "Western World," and that there was a public eager for suchestimate is evidenced by the fact that the book went through fourBritish editions in 1850[24]. At the end of the decade, then, thereappeared once more a vigorous champion of the cause of Britishdemocracy, comparing the results of "government by the wise" withalleged mob rule. Mackay wrote:     "Society in America started from the point to which society     in Europe is only yet finding. The equality of men is, to     this moment, its corner-stone ... that which develops itself     as the sympathy of class, becomes in America the general     sentiment of society.... We present an imposing front to the     world; but let us tear the picture and look at the canvas.     One out of every seven of us is a pauper. Every six     Englishmen have, in addition to their other enormous burdens,     to support a seventh between them, whose life is spent in     consuming, but in adding nothing to the source of their     common subsistence."British governing classes then, forgoing after 1850 opposition to theadvance of American power, found themselves involved again, as before1832, in the problem of the possible influence of a prosperous Americandemocracy upon an unenfranchised public opinion at home. Also, for allEnglishmen, of whatever class, in spite of rivalry in power, of opposingtheories of trade, of divergent political institutions, there existed avague, though influential, pride in the advance of a people of similarrace, sprung from British loins[25]. And there remained for allEnglishmen also one puzzling and discreditable American institution,slavery--held up to scorn by the critics of the United States, difficultof excuse among her friends.Agitation conducted by the great philanthropist, Wilberforce, had earlycommitted British Government and people to a crusade against the Africanslave trade. This British policy was clearly announced to the world inthe negotiations at Vienna in 1814-15. But Britain herself stillsupported the institution of slavery in her West Indian colonies and itwas not until British humanitarian sentiment had forced emancipationupon the unwilling sugar planters, in 1833, that the nation was morallyfree to criticize American domestic slavery. Meanwhile greatemancipation societies, with many branches, all virile and active, hadgrown up in England and in Scotland. These now turned to an attack onslavery the world over, and especially on American slavery. The greatAmerican abolitionist, Garrison, found more support in England than inhis own country; his weekly paper, _The Liberator_, is full of messagesof cheer from British friends and societies, and of quotations from asympathetic, though generally provincial, British press.From 1830 to 1850 British anti-slavery sentiment was at its height. Itwatched with anxiety the evidence of a developing struggle over slaveryin the United States, hopeful, as each crisis arose, that the freeNorthern States would impose their will upon the Southern Slave States.But as each crisis turned to compromise, seemingly enhancing the powerof the South, and committing America to a retention of slavery, thehopes of British abolitionists waned. The North did indeed, to Britishopinion, become identified with opposition to the expansion of slavery,but after the "great compromise of 1850," where the elder Americanstatesmen of both North and South proclaimed the "finality" of thatmeasure, British sympathy for the North rapidly lessened. Moreover,after 1850, there was in Britain itself a decay of general humanitariansentiment as regards slavery. The crusade had begun to seem hopeless andthe earlier vigorous agitators were dead. The British Government stillmaintained its naval squadron for the suppression of the African slavetrade, but the British official mind no longer keenly interested itselfeither in this effort or in the general question of slavery.Nevertheless American slavery and slave conditions were still, after1850, favourite matters for discussion, almost universally critical, byEnglish writers. Each renewal of the conflict in America, even thoughlocal, not national in character, drew out a flood of comment. In thepublic press this blot upon American civilization was a steady subjectfor attack, and that attack was naturally directed against the South.The London _Times_, in particular, lost no opportunity of presenting thematter to its readers. In 1856, a Mr. Thomas Gladstone visited Kansasduring the height of the border struggles there, and reported hisobservations in letters to the _Times_. The writer was wholly on theside of the Northern settlers in Kansas, though not hopeful that theKansas struggle would expand to a national conflict. He constantlydepicted the superior civilization, industry, and social excellence ofthe North as compared with the South[26].Mrs. Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ excited greater interest in Englandthan in America itself. The first London edition appeared in May, 1852,and by the end of the year over one million copies had been sold, asopposed to one hundred and fifty thousand in the United States. But ifone distinguished writer is to be believed, this great British interestin the book was due more to English antipathy to America than toantipathy to slavery[27]. This writer was Nassau W. Senior, who, in1857, published a reprint of his article on "American Slavery" in the206th number of the _Edinburgh Review_, reintroducing in his bookextreme language denunciatory of slavery that had been cut out by theeditor of the _Review_[28]. Senior had been stirred to write by thebrutal attack upon Charles Sumner in the United States Senate after hisspeech of May 19-20, 1856, evidence, again, that each incident of theslavery quarrel in Amer
