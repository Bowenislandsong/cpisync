General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.

Pleasure with violeteyes was in Chicago.  My passport describes me as a journalist.My employer said:  "Go to Jerusalem."  I went, that was in 1920.I had been there a couple of times before the World War, when theTurks were in full control.  So I knew about the bedbugs and thestench of the citadel moat;  the pre-war price of camels;  enoughArabic to misunderstand it when spoken fluently, and enough ofthe Old Testament and the Koran to guess at Arabian motives,which are important, whereas words are usually such stuff as liesare made of.El Kudz, as Arabs call Jerusalem, is, from a certain distance, asthey also call it, shellabi kabir.  Extremely beautiful.Beautiful upon a mountain.  El Kudz means The City, and in acertain sense it is that, to unnumbered millions of people.Ludicrous, uproarious, dignified, pious, sinful, naivelyconfidential, secretive, altruistic, realistic.  Hoary-ancientand ultra-modern.  Very, very proud of its name Jerusalem, whichmeans City of Peace.  Full to the brim with the malice ofcertainly fifty religions, fifty races, and five hundred thousandcurious political chicaneries disguised as plans to save oursouls from hell and fill some fellow's purse.  The jailsare full."Look for a man named Grim," said my employer.  "James SchuylerGrim, American, aged thirty-four or so.  I've heard he knowsthe ropes."The ropes, when I was in Jerusalem before the war, wereprincipally used for hanging people at the Jaffa Gate, after theyhad been well beaten on the soles of their feet to compel them totell where their money was hidden.  The Turks entirely understoodthe arts of suppression and extortion, which they defined asgovernment.  The British, on the other hand, subject their normalhuman impulse to be greedy, and their educated craving to begentlemanly white man's burden-bearers, to a process of compromise.Perhaps that isn't government.  But it works.  They even carrycompromise to the point of not hanging even their critics ifthey can possibly avoid doing it.  They had not yet, but theywere about to receive a brand-new mandate from a brand-newLeague of Nations, awkwardly qualified by Mr. Balfour'spost-Armistice promise to the Zionists to give the country tothe Jews, and by a war-time promise, in which the French hadjoined, to create an Arab kingdom for the Arabs.So there was lots of compromising being done, and hell to pay,with no one paying, except, of course, the guests in the hotels,at New York prices.  The Zionist Jews were arriving in droves.The Arabs, who owned most of the land, were threatening to cutall the Jews' throats as soon as they could first get all theirmoney.  Feisal, a descendant of the Prophet, who had foughtgloriously against the Turks, was romantically getting ready inDamascus to be crowned King of Syria.  The French, who pridethemselves on being realistic, were getting ready to go afterFeisal with bayonets and poison-gas, as they eventually did.In Jerusalem the Bolsheviks, astonishingly credulous of "secret"news from Moscow, and skeptical of every one's opinion but theirown, were bolsheviking Marxian Utopia beneath a screen of sucharrogant innocence that even the streetcorner police constablessuspected them.  And Mustapha Kemal, in Anatolia, was rumoured tobe preparing a holy war.  It was known as a Ghazi in thosedays.  He had not yet scrapped religion.  He was contemplating,so said rumour, a genuine old-fashioned moslem jihad, withmodern trimmings.A few enthusiasts astonishingly still laboured for an Americanmandate.  At the Holy Sepulchre a British soldier stood on guardwith bayonet and bullets to prevent the priests of rival creedsfrom murdering one another.  The sun shone and so did the stars.General Bols reopened Pontius Pilate's water-works.  The learnedmonks in convents argued about facts and theories denied byarchaeologists.  Old-fashioned Jews wailed at the Wailing Wall.Tommy Atkins blasphemously dug corpses of donkeys and dogs fromthe Citadel moat.I arrived in the midst of all that, and spent a couple of monthstrying to make head or tail of it, and wondering, if that waspeace, what war is?  They say that wherever a man was ever slainin Palestine a flower grows.  So one gets a fair idea of thecountry's mass-experience without much difficulty.  For threemonths of the year, from end to end, the whole landscape iscarpeted with flowers so close together that, except where beastsand men have trodden winding tracks, one can hardly walk withoutcrushing an anemone or wild chrysanthemum.  There are morebattle-fields in that small land than all Europe can show.  Thereare streams everywhere that historians assert repeatedly "ranblood for days."Five thousand years of bloody terrorism, intermingling of races,piety, plunder, politics and pilgrims, have produced a self-consciousness as concentrated as liquid poison-gas.  The laughteris sarcastic, the humour sardonic, and the credulity beyondanalysis.  For instance, when I got there, I heard the Britishbeing accused of "imperialistic savagery" because they hadremoved the leprous beggars from the streets into a clean placewhere they could receive medical treatment.It was difficult to find one line of observation.  Whateveranybody told you, was reversed entirely by the next man.  Thethroat-distorting obligation to study Arabic called for ratherintimate association with educated Arabs, whose main obsessionwas fear of the Zionist Jews.  The things they said againstthe Jews turned me pro-Zionist.  So I cautiously made theacquaintance of some gentlemen with gold-rimmed spectacles, andthe things they said about the Arabs set me to sympathizing withthe sons of Ishmael again.In the midst of that predicament I met Jimgrim--Major JamesSchuyler Grim, to give him his full title, although hardly anyone ever called him by it.  After that, bewilderment began tocease as, under his amused, painstaking fingers, thread afterthread of the involved gnarl of plots and politics betrayedits course.However, first I must tell how I met him.  There is an AmericanColony in Jerusalem--a community concern that runs a one-pricestore, and is even more savagely criticized than the BritishAdministration, as is only natural.  The story of what they didin the war is a three-year epic.  You can't be "epic" and notmake enemies.A Chicago Jew assured me they were swine and horse-thieves.  ButI learned that the Yemen Jews prayed for them--first prayer--every Sabbath of the year, calling down blessings on their headsfor charitable service rendered.One hardly goes all the way to Palestine to meet Americans;  buta journalist can't afford to be wilfully ignorant.  A Britishofficial assured me they were "good blokes" and an Armenian toldme they could skin fleas for their hides and tallow;  but theArmenian was wearing a good suit, and eating good food, which headmitted had been given to him by the American Colony.  He wasbitter with them because they had refused to cash a draft onMosul, drawn on a bank that had ceased to exist.It seemed a good idea to call on the American Colony, at theirstore near the Jaffa Gate, and it turned out to be a very cleanspot in a dirty city.  I taxed their generosity, and sat forhours on a ten-thousand-dollar pile of Asian rugs behind thestore;  and, whatever I have missed and lost, or squandered, atleast I know their story and can keep it until the proper time.Of course, you have to allow for point of view, just as themariner allows for variation and deviation;  but when theyinferred that most of the constructive good that has come to theNear East in the last fifty years has been American, they spokewith the authority of men who have lived on the spot and watchedit happen."You see, the Americans who have come here haven't set upgovernments.  They've opened schools and colleges.  They'vepoured in education, and taken nothing.  Then there are thousandsof Arabs, living in hovels because there's nothing better, whohave been to America and brought back memories with them.  Allthat accounts for the desire for an American mandate--which wouldbe a very bad thing, though, because the moment we set up agovernment we would lose our chance to be disinterested.  Thecountry is better off under any other mandate, provided it givesAmericans the right to teach without ruling.  America's missionis educational.  There's an American, though, who might seem toprove the contrary.  Do you see him?"There were two Arabs in the room, talking in low tones over bythe window. I could imagine the smaller of the two as a peddlerof lace and filigree-silver in the States, who had taken outpapers for the sake of privilege and returned full of notions toexploit his motherland.  But the tall one--never.  He was aBedouin, if ever a son of the desert breathed.  If he had visitedthe States, then he had come back as unchanged as gold out of anacid bath;  and as for being born there--"That little beady-eyed, rat-faced fellow may be an American," Isaid.  "In fact, of course he is, since you say so.  But as forbeing up to any good--""You're mistaken.  You're looking at the wrong man.  Observe theother one."I was more than ever sure I was not mistaken.  Stately gesture,dignity, complexion, attitude--to say nothing of his Bedouinarray and the steadiness with which he kept his dark eyes fixedon the smaller man he was talking to, had laid the stamp of thedesert on the taller man from head to heel."That tall man is an American officer in the British army.Doesn't look the part, eh?  They say he was the first American tobe granted a commission without any pretense of his being aCanadian.  They accepted him as an American.  It was a case ofthat or nothing.  Lived here for years, and knew the country sowell that they felt they had to have him on his own terms."You can believe anything in Jerusalem after you have been in theplace a week or two, so, seeing who my informant was, I swallowedthe fact.  But it was a marvel.  It seemed even greater when theman strolled out, pausing to salute my host with the solemnpoliteness that warfare with the desert breeds.  You could notimagine that at Ellis Island, or on Broadway--even on the stage.It was too untheatrical to be acting;  too individual to beimitation;  to unself-conscious to have been acquired.  Ihazarded a guess."A red man, then.  Carlisle for education.  Swallowed again bythe first desert he stayed in for more than a week.""Wrong.  His name is Grim.  Sounds like Scandinavian ancestry, onone side.  James Schuyler Grim--Dutch, then, on the other;  andsome English.  Ten generations in the States at any rate.  He cantell you all about this country.  Why not call on him?"It did not need much intelligence to agree to that suggestion;but the British military take their code with them to theuttermost ends of earth, behind which they wonder why so manyfolks with different codes, or none, dislike them."Write me an introduction," I said."You won't need one.  Just call on him.  He lives at a place theycall the junior Staff Officers' Mess--up beyond the RussianConvent and below the Zionist Hospital."So I went that evening, finding the way with difficulty becausethey talk at least eighteen languages in Jerusalem and, with theexception of official residences, no names were posted anywhere.That was not an official residence.  It was a sort of communalboarding-house improvised by a dozen or so officers in preferenceto the bug-laden inconvenience of tents--in a German-owned(therefore enemy property) stone house at the end of an alley, ina garden full of blooming pomegranates.I sent my card in by a flat-footed old Russian female, who randown passages and round corners like a wet hen, trying to find aman-servant.  The place seemed deserted, but presently she cameon her quarry in the back yard, and a very small boy in atarboosh and knickerbockers carried the card on a tray into aroom on the left.  Through the open door I could hear one quietquestion and a high-pitched disclaimer of all knowledge;  then anorder, sounding like a grumble, and the small boy returned to thehall to invite me in, in reasonably good English, of which heseemed prouder than I of my Arabic.So I went into the room on the left, with that Bedouin still inmind.  There was only one man in there, who got out of a deeparmchair as I entered, marking his place in a book with aDamascus dagger.  He did not look much more than middle height,nor more than medium dark complexioned, and he wore a major'skhaki uniform."Beg pardon," I said.  "I've disturbed the wrong man.  I came tocall on an American named Major Grim.""I'm Grim.""Must be a mistake, though.  The man I'm looking for is tallerthan you--very dark--looks, walks, speaks and acts like aBedouin.  I saw him this afternoon in Bedouin costume in theAmerican Colony store.""Yes, I noticed you.  Sit down, won't you?  Yes, I'm he--theBedouin abayi* seems to add to a man's height.  Soap and wateraccount for the rest of it.  These cigars are from the States."[*Long-sleeved outer cloak.]It was hard to believe, even on the strength of his straightstatement--he talking undisguised American, and smiling at me, nodoubt vastly pleased with my incredulity."Are you a case of Jekyll and Hyde?" I asked."No.  I'm more like both sides of a sandwich with some army mule-meat in the middle.  But I won't be interviewed.  I hate it.Besides, it's against the regulations."His voice was not quite so harshly nasal as those of the MiddleWest, but he had not picked up the ultra-English drawl andclipped-off consonants that so many Americans affect abroadand overdo.I don't think a wise crook would have chosen him as a subject forexperiments.  He had dark eyes with noticeably long lashes;heavy eyebrows;  what the army examination-sheets describe as amedium chin;  rather large hands with long, straight fingers;and feet such as an athlete stands on, fully big for his size,but well shaped.  He was young for a major--somewhere betweenthirty and thirty-five.Once he was satisfied that I would not write him up for thenewspapers he showed no disinclination to talk, although it wasdifficult to keep him on the subject of himself, and easy to lethim lose you in a maze of tribal history.  He seemed to know theins and outs of every blood-feud from Beersheba to Damascus, andwarmed to his subject as you listened."You see," he said, by way of apology when I laughed at a stringof names that to me conjured up only confusion, "my beat is allthe way from Cairo to Aleppo--both sides of the Jordan.  I'm noton the regular strength, but attached to the Intelligence--no,not permanent--don't know what the future has in store--thatprobably depends on whether or not the Zionists get full control,and how soon.  Meanwhile, I'm my own boss more or less--reportdirect to the Administrator, and he's one of those men who allowsyou lots of scope."That was the sort of occasional glimpse he gave of himself, andthen switched off into straight statements about the Zionistproblem.  All his statements were unqualified, and given with theair of knowing all about it right from the beginning."There's nothing here that really matters outside the Zionist-Arab problem.  But that's a big one.  People don't realize it--even on the spot--but it's a world movement with ramificationseverywhere.  All the other politics of the Near East hinge on it,even when it doesn't appear so on the surface.  You see, the Jewshave international affiliations through banks and commerce.  Theyhave blood-relations everywhere.  A ripple here may mean there'sa wave in Russia, or London, or New York.  I've known at leastone Arab blood-feud over here that began with a quarrel between aJew and a Christian in Chicago.""Are the Zionists as dangerous as the Arabs seem to think?" I asked."Yes and no.  Depends what you call danger.  They're like anincoming tide.  All you can do is accept the fact and ride on topof it, move away in front of it, or go under.  The Arabs want topush it back with sword-blades.  Can't be done!""Speaking as a mere onlooker, I feel sorry for the Arabs," Isaid.  "It has been their country for several hundred years.They didn't even drive the Jews out of it;  the Romans attendedto that, after the Assyrians and Babylonians had cleaned upnine-tenths of the population.  And at that, the Jews wereinvaders themselves.""Sure," Grim answered.  "But you can't argue with tides.  TheArabs are sore, and nobody has any right to blame them.  TheEnglish betrayed the Arabs--I don't mean the fellows out here,but the gang at the Foreign Office."I glanced at his uniform.  That was a strange statement comingfrom a man who wore it.  He understood, and laughed."Oh, the men out here all admit it.  They're as sore as the Arabsare themselves.""Then you're on the wrong side, and you know it?" I suggested."The meat," he said, "is in the middle of the sandwich.  In asmall way you might say I'm a doctor, staying on after a riot tostitch up cuts.  The quarrel was none of my making, although Iwas in it and did what I could to help against the Turks.  Likeeverybody else who knows them, I admire the Turks and hate whatthey stand for--hate their cruelty.  I was with Lawrence acrossthe Jordan--went all the way to Damascus with him--saw the warthrough to a finish--in case you choose to call it finished."Vainly I tried to pin him down to personal reminiscences.  He wasnot interested in his own story."The British promised old King Hussein of Mecca that if he'draise an Arab army to use against the Turks, there should be aunited Arab kingdom afterward under a ruler of their ownchoosing.  The kingdom was to include Syria, Arabia andPalestine.  The French agreed.  Well, the Arabs raised the army;Emir Feisul, King Hussein's third son, commanded it;  Lawrencedid so well that he became a legend.  The result was, Allenbycould concentrate his army on this side of the Jordan andclean up.  He made a good job of it.  The Arabs were naturallycock-a-hoop."I suggested that the Arabs with that great army could haveenforced the contract, but he laughed again."They were being paid in gold by the British, and had Lawrence tohold them together.  The flow of gold stopped, and Lawrence wassent home.  Somebody at the Foreign Office had changed his mind.You see, they were all taken by surprise at the speed ofAllenby's campaign.  The Zionists saw their chance, and claimedPalestine.  No doubt they had money and influence.  Perhaps itwas Jewish gold that had paid the wages of the Arab army.Anyhow, the French laid claim to Syria.  By the time the war wasover the Zionists had a hard-and-fast guarantee, the French claimto Syria had been admitted, and there wasn't any country leftexcept some Arabian desert to let the Arabs have.  That's thesituation.  Feisul is in Damascus, going through the farce ofbeing proclaimed king, with the French holding the sea-ports andgetting ready to oust him.  The Zionists are in Jerusalem,working like beavers, and the British are getting ready to pullout as much as possible and leave the Zionists to do their ownworrying.  Mesopotamia is in a state of more or less anarchy.Egypt is like a hot-box full of explosive--may go off any minute.The Arabs would like to challenge the world to mortal combat,and then fight one another while the rest of the world paysthe bill--""And you?""The French, for instance.  Their army is weak at the moment.They've neither men nor money--only a hunger to own Syria.  Theydon't play what the English call 'on side.'  They play a meangame.  The French General Staff figure that if Feisul shouldattack them now he might beat them.  So they've conceived thebrilliant idea of spreading sedition and every kind of politicaldiscontent into Palestine and across the Jordan, so that if theArabs make an effort they'll make it simultaneously in bothcountries.  Then the British, being in the same mess with theFrench, would have to take the French side and make a jointcampaign of it.""But don't the British know this?""You bet they know it.  What's the Intelligence for?  The Frenchare hiring all the Arab newspapers to preach against the British.A child could see it with his eyes shut.""Then why in thunder don't the British have a showdown?""That's where the joker comes in.  The French know there's a sortof diplomatic credo at the London Foreign Office to the generaleffect that England and France have got to stand together orEurope will go to pieces.  The French are realists.  They bankon that.  They tread on British corns, out here, all they wantto, while they toss bouquets, backed by airplanes, across theEnglish Channel.""Then the war didn't end the old diplomacy?""What a question!  But I haven't more than scratched the NearEast surface for you yet.  There's Mustapha Kemal in Anatolia,leader of the Turkish Nationalists, no more dead or incapacitatedthan a possum.  He's playing for his own hand--Kaiser Willystuff--studying Trotzky and Lenin, and flirting with Feisul'sparty on the side.  Then there's a Bolshevist element among theZionists--got teeth, too.  There's an effort being made fromIndia to intrigue among the Sikh troops employed in Palestine.There's a very strong party yelling for an American mandate.  TheArmenians, poor devils, are pulling any string they can get holdof, in the hope that anything at all may happen.  The orthodoxJews are against the Zionists;  the Arabs are against them both,and furious with one another.  There's a pan-Islam movement onfoot, and a pan-Turanian--both different, and opposed.  About 75per cent of the British are as pro-Arab as they dare be, but therest are strong for the Zionists.  And the Administrator'sneutral!--strong for law and order but taking no sides.""And you?""I'm one of the men who is trying to keep the peace."He invited me to stay to dinner.  The other members of the messwere trooping in, all his juniors, all obviously fond of himand boisterously irreverent of his rank.  Dinner under hischairmanship was a sort of school for repartee.  It was utterlyunlike the usual British mess dinner.  If you shut your eyes fora minute you couldn't believe that any one present had ever worna uniform.  I learned afterward that there was quite a littlecompetition to get into that mess.After dinner most of them trooped out again, to dance withZionist ladies at an institute affair.  But he and I stayed, andtalked until midnight.  Before I left, the key of Palestine andSyria was in my hands."You seem interested," he said, coming with me to the door.  "Ifyou don't mind rough spots now and then, I'll try to show you afew things at first hand."Chapter Two"No objection;  only a stipulation."The showmanship began much sooner than I hoped.  The followingday was Sunday, and I had an invitation to a sort of semi-publictea given by the American Colony after their afternoon religiousservice.They received their guests in a huge, well-furnished room on theupper floor of a stone house built around a courtyard filled withflowers.  I think they were a little proud of the number offierce-looking Arabs, who had traveled long distances in order tobe present.  Ten Arab chieftains in full costume, with fifteen ortwenty of their followers, all there at great expense of trouble,time and money, for friends sake, were, after all, something tofeel a bit chesty about.  Every member of the Colony seemed ableto talk Arabic like a native and, as they used to say in the up-state papers, a good time was being had by all.  The Near Eastadores ice-cream, and there was lots of it.Two of the Arab chiefs were Christians;  the rest were not.  Thepeace and war record of the Colony was what had brought them allthere.  Hardly an Arab in the country was not the Colony's debtorfor disinterested help, direct or indirect, at some time in someway.  The American Colony was the one place in the country wherea man of any creed could go and be sure that whatever he mightsay would not be used against him.  So they were talking theirheads off.  Hot air and Arab politics have quite a lot in common.But there was a broad desert-breath about it all.  It wasn't likethe little gusty yaps you hear in the city coffee-shops.  A lotof the talk was foolish, but it was all magnificent.There was one sheikh named Mustapha ben Nasir dressed in a blueserge suit and patent-leather boots, with nothing to show hisnationality except a striped silk head-dress with the camel-hairband around the forehead.  He was a handsome fellow, with a blackbeard trimmed to a point, and perfect manners, polished no doubtin a dozen countries, but still Eastern in slow, deferentialdignity.  He could talk good French.  I fell in conversationwith him.The frankness with which treason is mooted, admitted anddiscussed in the Near East is one of the first things that amazeyou.  They are so open about it that nobody takes them seriously.Apparently it is only when they don't talk treason openly thatthe ruling authorities get curious and make arrests.  To me, atotal stranger, with nothing to recommend me but that for an houror two that afternoon I was a guest of the American Colony,Mustapha ben Nasir made no bones whatever about the fact that thewas being paid by the French to stir up feeling over Jordanagainst the British."I receive a monthly salary," he boasted.  "I am just fromDamascus, where the French Liaison-officer paid me and gave mesome instructions.""Where is your home?" I asked him."At El-Kerak, in the mountains of Moab, across the Dead Sea.  Istart this evening.  Will you come with me?""Je m'en bien garderai!"He smiled.  "Myself, I am in favor of the British.  The Frenchpay my expenses, that is all.  What we all want is an independentArab government--some say kingdom, some say republic.  If it isnot time for that yet, then we would choose an American mandate.But America has deserted us.  Failing America, we prefer theEnglish for the present.  Anything except France!  We do not wantto become a new Algeria.""What is the condition now at El-Kerak?""Condition?  There is none.  There is chaos.  You see, theBritish say their authority ceases at the River Jordan and at aline drawn down the middle of the Dead Sea.  That leaves us witha choice between two other governments--King Hussein's governmentof Mecca, and Feisul's in Syria.  But Hussein's arm is not longenough to reach us from the South, and Feisul's is not nearlystrong enough to interfere from the North.  So there isno government, and each man is keeping the peace with hisown sword.""You mean;  each man on his own account?""Yes.  So there is peace.  Five--fifteen--thirty throats are cutdaily;  and if you go down to the Jordan and listen, you willhear the shots being fired from ambush any day.""And you invite me to make the trip with you?""Oh, that is nothing.  In the first place, you are American.Nobody will interfere with an American.  They are welcome.  Inthe second place, there is a good reason for bringing you;  weall want an American school at El-Kerak.""But I am no teacher.""But you will be returning to America?  It is enough, then, thatyou look the situation over, and tell what you know on yourreturn.  We will provide a building, a proper salary, andguarantee the teacher's life.  We would prefer a woman, but itwould be wisest to send a man.""How so?  The woman might not shoot straight?  I've some of ourWestern women do tricks with a gun that would--""There would be no need.  She would have our word of honour.  Butevery sheikh who has only three wives would want to make her hisfourth.  A man would be best.  Will you come with me?""On your single undertaking to protect me?  Are you king of allthat countryside?""If you will come, you shall have an escort, every man of whomwill die before he would let you be killed.  And if they, andyou, should all be killed, their sons and grandsons would avengeyou to the third generation of your murderers.""That's undoubtedly handsome, but--""Believe me, effendi," he urged, "many a soul has been consoledin hell-fire by the knowledge that his adversaries would be cutoff in their prime by friends who are true to their given word."Meaning to back out politely, I assured him I would think theoffer over."Well and good," he answered.  "You have my promise.  Should youdecide to come, leave word here with the American Colony.  Theywill get word to me.  Then I will send for you, and the escortshall meet you at the Dead Sea."I talked it over with two or three members of the Colony, andthey assured me the promise could be depended on.  One ofthem added:"Besides, you ought to see El-Kerak.  It's an old crusader city,rather ruined, but more or less the way the crusaders left it.And that craving of theirs for a school is worth doing somethingabout, if you ever have an opportunity.  They say they have toomuch religion already, and no enlightenment at all.  A teacherwho knew Arabic would have a first-class time, and would be wellpaid and protected, if he could keep his hands off politics.  Whynot talk with Major Grim?"It was a half-hour's walk to Grim's place, but I had the goodfortune to catch him in again.  He was sitting in the same chair,studying the same book, and this time I saw the title of it--Walter Pater's Marius the Epicurean--a strange book for a soldierto be reading, and cutting its pages with an inlaid dagger, in aJerusalem semi-military boarding-house.  But he was a man ofunexpectedly assorted moods.He laughed when I told of ben Nasir.  He looked serious when Imooted El-Kerak--serious, then interested, them speculative.From where I sat I could watch the changes in his eyes."What would the escort amount to?" I asked him."Absolute security.""And what's this bunk about Americans being welcome anywhere?""Perfectly true.  All the way from Aleppo down to Beersheba.  Menlike Dr. Bliss* have made such an impression that an occasionalrotter might easily take advantage of it.  Americans in thiscountry--so far--stand for altruism without ulterior motive.If we'd accepted the mandate they might have found us out!Meanwhile, an American is safe."  [*President of the AmericanCollege at Beirut.  Died 1920, probably more respected throughoutthe Near East than any ten men of any other nationality.]"Then I think I'll go to El-Kerak."Again his eyes grew speculative.  I could not tell whether he wasconsidering me or some problem of his own."Speaking unofficially," he said, "there are two possibilities.You might go without permission--easy enough, provided you don'ttalk beforehand.  In that case, you'd get there and back;  afterwhich, the Administration would label and index you.  Theremainder of your stay in Palestine would be about as excitingas pushing a perambulator in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.  You'dbe canned.""I'd rather be killed.  What's the alternative?""Get permission.  I shall be at El-Kerak myself within the nextfew days.  I think it can be arranged.""D'you mean I can go with you?" I asked, as eager as a schoolboyfor the circus."Not on your life!  I don't go as an American."Recalling the first time I had seen him, I sat still and tried tolook like a person who was not thrilled in the least by seeingsecrets from the inside."Well," I said, "I'm in your hands."I think he rather liked that.  As I came to know him moreintimately later on he revealed an iron delight in being trusted.But he did not say another word for several minutes, as if therewere maps in his mind that he was conning before reaching adecision.  Then he spoke suddenly."Are you busy?" he asked.  "Then come with me."He phoned to some place or other for a staff automobile, and theman was there with it within three minutes.  We piled in anddrove at totally unholy speed down narrow streets between walls,around blind right-angle turns where Arab policemen stood wavingunintelligible signals, and up the Mount of Olives, past theBritish military grave-yard, to the place they call OETA.*  TheKaiser had it built to command every view of the countryside andbe seen from everywhere, as a monument to his own greatness--thebiggest, lordliest, most expensive hospice that his architectscould fashion, with pictures in mosaic on the walls and ceilingsof the Kaiser and his ancestors in league with the Almighty.  Butthe British had adopted it as Administration Headquarters.[*Headquarters:  Occupied Enemy Territory Administration.]All the way up, behind and in front and on either hand, therewere views that millions* would give years of their lives to see;and they would get good value for their bargain.  Behind us, thesky-line was a panorama of the Holy City, domes, minarets andcurved stone roofs rising irregularly above gray battlementedwalls.  Down on the right was the ghastly valley of Jehoshaphat,treeless, dry, and crowded with white tombs--"dry bones in thevalley of death."  To the left were everlasting limestone hills,one of them topped by the ruined reputed tomb of Samuel--alltrenched, cross-trenched and war-scarred, but covered now in aJoseph's coat of flowers, blue, blood-red, yellow and white. [*This is no exaggeration.  There are actually millions, and onmore than one continent, whose dearest wish, could they have it,would be to see Jerusalem before they die.]There were lines of camels sauntering majestically along threehill-tops, making time, and the speed of the car we rode in, seemutterly unreal.  And as we topped the hill the Dead Sea lay belowus, like a polished turquoise set in the yellow gold of thebarren Moab Mountains.  That view made you gasp.  Even Grim, whowas used to it, could not turn his eyes away.We whirled past saluting Sikhs at the pompous Kaiserish entrancegate, and got out on to front steps that brought to mind one ofthose glittering hotels at German cure-resorts--bad art, badtaste, bad amusements and a big bill.But inside, in the echoing stone corridors that opened throughGothic windows on a courtyard, in which statues of German super-people stared with blind eyes, there was nothing now but baldmilitary neatness and economy.  Hurrying up an uncarpeted stonestairway (Grim seemed to be a speed-demon once his mind was set)we followed a corridor around two sides of the square, pastdozens of closed doors bearing department names, to theAdministrator's quarters at the far end.  There, on a bare benchin a barren ante-room, Grim left me to cool my heels.  Heknocked, and entered a door marked "private."It was fully half an hour before the door opened again and I wasbeckoned in.  Grim was alone in the room with the Administrator,a rather small, lean, rigidly set up man, with merry fire in hiseye, and an instantly obvious gift for being obeyed.  He sat atan enormous desk, but would have looked more at ease in a tent,or on horseback.  The three long rows of campaign ribbons lookedincongruous beside the bunch of flowers that somebody had crammedinto a Damascus vase on the desk, with the estimable militarynotion of making the utmost use of space.Sir Louis was certainly in an excellent temper.  He offered me achair, and looked at me with a sort of practical good-humour thatseemed to say, "Well, here he is;  now how shall we handle him?"I was minded to ask outright for what I wanted, but something inhis attitude revealed that he knew all that already and wouldprefer to come at the problem in his own way.  It was clear,without a word being said, that he proposed to make some sort ofuse of me without being so indiscreet as to admit it.  Hereminded me rather of Julius Caesar, who was also a little man,considering the probable qualifications of some minor spoke in aprodigious wheel of plans."I understand you want to go to El-Kerak?" he said, smiling as ifall life were an amusing game.I admitted the impeachment.  Grim was standing, some little waybehind me and to one side;  I did not turn my head to look athim, for that might have given a false impression that he and Iwere in league together, but I was somehow aware that with foldedarms he was studying me minutely."Well," said Sir Louis, "there's no objection;  only astipulation:  We wouldn't let an Englishman go, because of therisk--not to him, but to us.  Any fool has a right to get killed,but not to obligate his government.  All the missionaries werecalled in from those outlying districts long ago.  We don't wantto be held liable for damages for failure to protect.  Suchthings have happened.  You see, the idea is, we assume noresponsibility for what takes place beyond the Jordan and theDead Sea.  Now, if you'd like to sign a letter waiving any claimagainst us for protection, that would remove any obstacle to yourgoing.  But, if you think that unreasonable, the alternative issafe.  You can, stay in Jerusalem.  Quite simple."That had the merit of frankness.  It sounded fair enough.Nevertheless, he was certainly not being perfectly frank.  Themerriment in his eyes meant something more than mere amusement.It occurred to me that his frankness took the extreme form of notconcealing that he had something important in reserve.  I ratherliked him for it.  His attitude seemed to be that if I wanted totake a chance, I might on my own responsibility, but that if mydoing so should happen to suit his plans, that was his affair.Grim was still watching me the way a cat watches a mouse."I'll sign such a letter," said I."Good.  Here are pen and paper.  Let's have it all in yourhandwriting.  I'll call a clerk to witness the signature."I wrote down the simple statement that I wished to go to El-Kerakfor personal reasons, and that I waived all claim against theBritish Administration for personal protection, whether there oren route.  A clerk, who looked as if he could not have been hiredto know, or understand, or remember anything without permission,came in answer to the bell.  I signed.  He witnessed.Sir Louis put the letter in a drawer, and the clerk wentout again."How soon will you go?"I told about the promised escort, and that a day or two would beneeded to get word to ben Nasir.  I forgot that ben Nasir wouldnot start before moonrise.  It appeared that Sir Louis knew morethan he cared to admit."Can't we get word to ben Nasir for him, Grim?"Grim nodded.  So did Sir Louis:"Good.  There'll be no need, then, for you to take any one intoconfidence," he said, turning to me again.  "As a rule it isn'twell to talk about these things, because people get wrong ideas.There are others in Jerusalem who would like permission to goto El-Kerak.""I'll tell nobody."He nodded again.  He was still considering things in the backof his mind, while those intelligent, bright eyes smiled sodisarmingly."How do you propose to reach the Dead Sea?" he asked.  "BenNasir's escort will probably meet you on the shore on this side.""Oh, hire some sort of conveyance, I suppose.""Couldn't we lend him one of our cars, Grim?"Grim nodded again."We'll do that.  Grim, can you get word to ben Nasir so that whenthe escort is ready he may send a messenger straight to the hotelwith the information?  D'you get my meaning?""Sure," said Grim, "nobody else need know then.""Very well," said Sir Louis.  He rose from his chair to intimatethat the precise moment had arrived when I might leave withoutindiscretion.  It was not until I was outside the door that Irealized that my permission was simply verbal, and that the onlydocument that had changed hands had been signed by me.  Grimfollowed me into the ante-room after a minute."Hadn't I better go back and ask for something in writing fromhim?" I suggested."You wouldn't get it.  Anyhow, you're dealing with a gentleman.You needn't worry.  I was afraid once or twice you might be goingto ask him questions.  He'd have canned you if you had.  Whydidn't you?"I was not going to help Grim dissect my mental processes."There's a delightful air of mystery," I said, "I'd hate tospoil it!""Come up on the tower," he said. "There's just time beforesunset.  If you've good eyes, I'll show you El-Kerak."It is an enormous tower.  The wireless apparatus connected withit can talk with Paris and Calcutta.  From the top you feel as ifyou were seeing "all the kingdoms of the world in a moment oftime."  There are no other buildings to cut off the view ortamper with perspective.  The Dead Sea was growing dark.  TheMoab Hills beyond it looked lonely and savage in silhouette."Down there on your left is Jericho," said Grim.  "That windingcreek beyond it is the Jordan.  As far eastward as that there'ssome peace.  Beyond that, there is hardly a rock that isn't usedfor ambush regularly.  Let your eye travel along the top of thehills--nearly as far as the end of the Dead Sea.  Now--d'you seewhere a touch of sunlight glints on something?  That's the top ofthe castle-wall of El-Kerak.  Judge what strategists those oldcrusaders were.  That site commands the ancient high road fromEgypt.  They could sit up there and take toll to their hearts'content.  The Turks quartered troops in the castle and did thesame thing.  But the Turks overdid it, like everything else.They ruined the trade.  No road there nowadays that amountsto anything.""It looks about ten miles away.""More than eighty."The sun went down behind us while we watched, and here and therethe little scattered lights came out among the silent hills inproof that there were humans who thought of them in terms ofhome.Venus and Mars shone forth, yellow and red jewels;  then themoon, rising like a stage effect, too big, too strongly lightedto seem real, peering inch by inch above the hills and usheringin silence.  We could hear one muezzin in Jerusalem wailing thatGod is God."That over yonder is savage country," Grim remarked.  "I thinkmaybe you'll like it. Time to go now."He said nothing more until we were scooting downhill in the carin the midst of a cloud of dust."You won't see me again," he said then, "until you get to El-Kerak.  There are just one or two points to bear in mind.  D'youcare if I lecture?""I wish you would.""When the messenger comes from ben Nasir, go to the Governorate,just outside the Damascus Gate, phone OETA, say who you are, andask for the car.  Travel light.  The less you take with you, theless temptation there'll be to steal and that much less dangerfor your escort.  I always take nothing,  and get shaved by amurderer at the nearest village.  If you wash too much, or changeyour shirt too often, they suspect you of putting on airs.  Can'ttravel too light.  Use the car as far as Jericho, or thereabouts,and send it back when the messenger says he's through with it.After that, do whatever the leader of the escort tells you, andyou'll be all right.""How do I cross the Dead Sea?""That's ben Nasir's business.  There's another point I'll ask youto bear in mind.  When you see me at El-Kerak, be sure not tomake the slightest sign of recognition, unless and until youget word from me.  Act as if you'd never seen me in yourlife before."I felt like an arch-conspirator, and there is no other sensationhalf so thrilling.  The flattery of being let in, as it were,through a secret door was like strong wine."Is your memory good?" Grim asked me.  "If you make notes, besure you let everybody see them;  you'll find more than one ofthem can read English.  If you should see or overhear anythingthat you'd particularly like to remember because it might proveuseful to me, note it down by making faint dots under the lettersof words you've already written;  or--better yet--take along apocket Bible;  they're all religious and respect the Bible.  Makefaint pencil lines underneath words or letters, and they'll thinkyou're more than extra devout.  There's nothing special to watchout for;  just keep your ears and eyes open.  Well, here's yourhotel.  See you again soon.  So long."I got out of the car and went to get ready for a Christian dinnerserved by Moslems, feeling like a person out of the ArabianNights, who had just met the owner of a magic carpet on which oneonly had to sit in order to be wafted by invisible forces intounimaginable realms of mystery.Chapter Three"Do whatever the leader of the escort tells you."I never learned exactly how Jim Grim got word to ben Nasir.  Mysuspicion is that he took the simple course of getting theAmerican Colony to send one of their men;  but as they neverreferred to it afterwards, and might have their own reasons forkeeping silence, I took care not to ask them.  We have most of usseen harm done by noisy gratitude for kindness, better covered up.I kept close to the hotel for three days, studying Arabic.  Bythe fourth afternoon discouragement set in.  I began to believethat the whole affair had petered out;  perhaps on reflection theAdministrator had decided I was not a proper person to be turnedloose out of bounds, and nobody could have blamed him for that,for he knew next to nothing about me.  Or Grim might have beencalled off for some other important business.  The chances seemedall against my going after all.But on the fourth evening, just at sunset, when the sandwiches Ihad ordered in advance were all thoroughly stale and I had almostdecided to unpack the small hand-grip and try to forget the wholeaffair, I noticed an Arab standing in the door of the hotelscrutinizing every one who passed him.  I watched him for fiveminutes.  He paid no attention to officers in uniform.  I left mychair in the lobby and walked past him twice.He had one eye, like a gimlet on a universal joint;  he turnedit this and that way without any corresponding movement of hishead.  It penetrated.  You felt he could have seen you with itin the dark.I started to pass him a third time.  He held his hand out andthrust a small, soiled piece of paper into mine.  The writing onit was in Arabic, so I went back to the seat in the far corner,to puzzle it out, he standing meanwhile in the doorway andcontinuing to quiz people as if I had meant nothing in his life.The message was short enough:Bearer will accompany you to a place where the escort willbe in readiness.  God give your honour a good journey.  MustaphaBen Nasir.I went to the Governorate and phoned for the car to come and pickme up outside the Jaffa Gate.  The Arab followed me, and he and Iwere both searched at the gate for weapons, by a Sikh who knewnothing and cared less about Near East politics.  His orders wereto search thoroughly.  He did it.  The man whose turn was nextahead of mine was a Russian priest, whose long black cloak didnot save him from painstaking suspicion.  He was stillindignantly refusing to take down his pants and prove that thehard lump on his thigh was really an amulet against sciatica,when the car came for me.It was an ordinary Ford car, and the driver was not in uniform.He, too, had only one eye in full commission, for the other wasbruised and father swollen.  I got in beside him and let the Arabhave the rear seat to himself, reflecting that I would be able tosmell all the Arab sweat I cared to in the days to come.We are governed much more by our noses than we are often awareof, and I believe that many people--in the East especially--usescent because intuition warns them that their true smell wouldarouse unconscious antagonism.  Dogs, as well as most wildanimals, fight at the suggestion of a smell.  Humans only differfrom the animals, much, when they are being self-consciouslyhuman.  Then they forget what they really know and tumbleheadlong into trouble.The driver seemed to know which road to take, and to be in noparticular hurry, perhaps on account of his injured eye.  He wasan ex-soldier, of course:  one of those under-sized Cockneys withthe Whitechapel pallor overlying a pugnacious instinct, who makesuch astonishing fighting-men in the intervals between sulkingand a sort of half-affectionate abuse of everything in sight.Being impatient to begin the adventure, I suggested more speed."Oh!" he answered.  "So you're another o' these people in an'urry to get to Jericho!  It's strynge.  The last one was aHarab.  Tyke it from me, gov'nor, I've driven the very lastHarab as gets more than twenty-five miles an hour out o' me,so 'elp me--"He tooled the car out on to the road toward Bethany, and down thesteep hill that passes under the Garden of Gethsemane, beforevouchsafing another word.  Then, as we started to climb the hillahead, he jerked his chin in the direction of the sharp turn wehad just passed in the bottom of the valley.  "Took that cornerlas' time on one wheel!""For the Arab?""Aye.  Taught me a lesson.  Never agayn!  I ain't no ArabianNight.  Nor yet no self-immolatin' 'Indoo invitin' no juggernautsto make no pancykes out o' me.  'Enceforth, I drives reasonable.All Harabs may go to 'ell for all o' me."He was itching to tell his story.  He was likely to tell itquicker for not being questioned;  your Cockney dislikes anythinghe can construe into inquisition.  I remarked that the roaddidn't seem made for speed--too narrow and too rough--and let itgo at that.He said no more until we reached the village of Bethany, and drewabreast of Lazarus' reputed tomb, where a pack of scavenger-dogsawoke and yelped around the wheels.  He did his best to runover one of them, but missed.  Then he could not hold his storyany longer."Two nights ago," he said, "they gives me orders to take a Harabto a point near Jericho.  After dark, I starts off, 'im on theback seat;  engine ain't warm yet, so we goes slow.  He leansforward after a couple o' minutes, an says 'Yalla kawam'!" *  SoI thinks to myself I'll show the blighter a thing or two, me notbein' used to takin' orders from no Harabs.  Soon as the engine's'ot I lets rip, an' you know now what the road's like.  When wegets to the top o' that 'ill above Gethsemane I lets extryspecial rip.  Thinks I, if you can stand what I can, my son,you've guts. [*Hurry up.]"Well, we 'its all the 'igh places, and lands on a bit o' levelroad just often enough to pick up more speed--comes round thatsharp bend on 'alf a wheel, syme as I told you--kills three pye-dogs for sure, an' maybe others, but I don't dare look round--misses a camel in the dark that close that the 'air on my armsan' legs fair crawled up an' down me--'it's a lump o' rock thatcomes near tippin' us into the ditch--an' carries on faster an'ever.  By the time we gets 'ere to Bethany, thinks I, it's timeto take a look an' see if my passenger's still in the bloomin'car.  So I slows down."The minute I turns my 'ead to 'ave a peer at 'im.  'Kawam!' 'esays. 'Quick!  Quick!'"So it strikes me I weren't in no such 'urry after all.  Why'urry for a Harab?  The car's been rattlin' worse 'n a tinker'sbasket.  I gets down to lave a look--lights a gasper*--an' takesmy bloomin' time about it.  You seen them yellow curs there byLazarus' tomb?  Well, they come for me, yappin' an' snarlin' tobeat 'ell.  I'm pickin' up stones to break their 'eads with--goodstones ain't such easy findin' in the dark, an' every time Istoops 'alf a dozen curs makes a rush for me--when what d'yousuppose?  That bloomin' Harab passenger o' mine vaults over intomy seat, an' afore I could say ''ell's bells' 'e's off.  I'd leftthe engine runnin'.  By the luck o' the Lord I 'angs on, an'scrambles in--back seat. [*Anglice--canteen cigarette.]"I thought at first I'd reach over an' get a half-nelson on 'imfrom behind.  But, strike me blind!  I didn't dare!"Look where we are now.  Can you see the 'air-pin turn at thebottom of this 'ill, with a ditch, beyond it?  Well, we takesthat turn in pitch-dark shadow with all four wheels in the air,an' you'd 'a thought we was a blinkin' airplane a doin' stunts.But 'e's a hexpert, 'e is, an' we 'olds the road.  From there onwe goes in one 'oly murderin' streak to a point about 'alf-way upthe 'ill where the Inn of the Good Samaritan stands on top.There we 'as two blow-outs simultaneous, an' thinks I, now, myson, I've got you!  I gets out."'You can drive,' I says, 'like Jehu son o' Nimshi what madeIsrael to sin.  Let's see you make bricks now without no bleedin'straw'!  I knew there weren't no tools under the seat--therenever are in this 'ere country if you've left your car out o'your sight for five minutes.  'You take off them two back tires,'I says, 'while I sit 'ere an meditate on the ways of Harabs!Maybe you're Moses,' I says, 'an know 'ow to work a miracle.'"But the only miracle about that bloke's 'is nerve.  'E gets out,'an begins to walk straight on up'ill without as much as a by-your-leave.  I shouts to 'im to come back.  But 'e walks on.  SoI picks up a stone off the pile I was sittin' on, an' I plugs 'imgood--'its 'im fair between the shoulder-blades.  You'd think, if'e was a Harab, that'ud bring 'im to 'is senses, wouldn't you?But what d'you suppose the blighter did?"Did you notice my left eye when you got in the car?  'E turnsback, an' thinks I, 'e's goin' to knife me.  But that sport coulduse 'is fists, an' believe me, 'e done it!  I can use 'em a bitmyself, an' I starts in to knock 'is block off, but 'e puts itall over me--weight, reach an' science.  Mind you, science!First Arab ever I see what 'ad science;  an' I don't more than'alf believe it now!"Got to 'and it to 'im.  'E was merciful.  'E let up on me theminute 'e see I'd 'ad enough.  'E starts off up'ill again.  Isits where 'e'd knocked me on to a stone pile, wishin' like 'ellfor a drink.  It was full moonlight, an' you could see for miles.After about fifteen minutes, me still meditatin' murder an'considerin' my thirst I seen 'em fetch a camel out o' the khan atthe Inn o' the Good Samaritan;  an' next thing you know, 'e's outo' sight.  Thinks I, that's the last of 'im, an' good riddance!But not a bit of it!"The men what fetched the camel for 'im comes down to me an' saysthe sheikh 'as left word I'm to be fed an' looked after.  Theyfixes me up at the inn with a cot an' blankets an' a supper o'sorts, an' I lies awake listenin' to 'em talkin' Arabic,understandin' maybe one word out of six or seven.  From what Ican make o' their conjecturin', they think 'e ain't no sheikh atall, but a bloomin' British officer in disguise!"Soon as morning comes I jump a passing commissariat lorry.  Assoon as I gets to Jerusalem I reports that sheikh for arson,theft, felo de se, busting a gov'ment car, usin' 'is fists whenby right 'e should ha' knifed me, an' every other crime I couldthink of.  An' all I gets is laughed at!  What d'you make of it?Think 'e was a Harab?"I wondered whether he was Jimgrim, but did not say so.  Grim hadnot appeared to me like a man who would use his fists at allreadily;  but he was such an unusual individual that it wasuseless trying to outline what he might or might not do.  It wasalso quite likely that the chauffeur had omitted mention of, say,nine-tenths of the provocation he gave his passenger.  Whatinterested me most was the thought that, if that really wasJimgrim, he must have been in a prodigious hurry about something;and that most likely meant excitement, if not danger across theDead Sea.We caught sight of the Dead Sea presently, bowling past the Innof the Good Samaritan and beginning to descend into the valley,twelve hundred feet below sea level, that separates Palestinefrom Moab.  The moon shone full on the water, and it looked morewan and wild than an illustration out of Dante's Inferno.  Therewas no doubt how the legends sprang up about birds falling deadas they flew across it.  It was difficult to believe thatanything could be there and not die.  It was a vision of the landof death made beautiful.But the one-eyed Arab on the rear seat began to sing.  To himthat view meant "home, sweet home."  His song was all about hisvillage and how he loved it--what a pearl it was--how sweeterthan all cities."'Ark at 'im!" The driver stopped the car to fill his pipe."You'd think 'e lived in 'eaven!  I've fought over every hinch o'this perishin' country, an' tyke it from me, guv'nor, there ain'ta village in it but what's composed of 'ovels wi' thatched roofs,an' 'eaps o' dung so you can't walk between 'em!  Any one aswants my share o' Palestine can 'ave it!"We bumped on again down a road so lonely that it would have feltgood to see a wild beast, or an armed man lurking in wait for us.But the British had accomplished the impossible:  They had solaid the fear of law along those roads that, though there mightbe murders to the right and left of them, the passer-by who keptto the road was safe, for the first time since the Romans now andthen imposed a temporary peace.At last, like two yellow streams glistening in moonlight, theroad forked--one way toward Jericho.  The other way appearedto run more or less parallel with the Dead Sea.  At that pointthe one-eyed Arab left off singing at last and clutched thedriver's shoulder."All right!  All right!" he answered impatiently, and stopped."Out you get, then!"He did not expect the tip I gave him.  He seemed to think itplaced him under obligation to wait there and talk for a fewminutes.  But my one-eyed guide waved him away disgustedly withthe hand that did not hold my bag, and we stood in the roadwatching until he vanished up-hill out of sight.  Then the guideplucked my sleeve and I followed him along the righthand road.We walked half a mile as fast as he could set foot to the ground.At last we reached a pretense of a village--a little cluster ofhalf-a-dozen thatched stone huts enclosed within one fence ofthorn and cactus.  Everything showed up as clearly in themoonlight as if painted with phosphorus.  The heavy shadows onlymade the high lights seem more luminous.  A man and two donkeyswere waiting for us outside the thorn hedge.  The man made noremark.  My guide and I mounted and rode on.Presently we turned down a track toward the Dead Sea, ridingamong huge shadows cast by the hills on our right hand.  Thelittle jackals they call foxes crossed our path at intervals.Owls the size of a robin, only vastly fluffier, screamed from therocks as we passed them.  Otherwise, it was like a soul's lastjourney, eerie, lonely and awful, down toward River Styx.Long before we caught sight of the water again, through a raggedgap between high limestone rocks, I could smell a village.  Theguide approached it cautiously, stopping every minute or so tolisten.  When we came on it at last it was down below us inabysmal darkness, one light shining through a window two feetsquare in proof we were not hesitating on the verge of theinfinite pit.The donkeys knew the way.  They trod daintily, like littleladies, along a circling track that goats made and men hadcertainly done nothing to improve.  We made an almost completeellipse around and down, and rode at last over dry dung at thebottom, into which the donkeys' feet sank as into a three-pilecarpet.  You could see the stars overhead, but nothing, where wewere, except that window and a shaft of yellow light withhundreds of moths dazzled in it.We must have made some noise in spite of the donkeys' vetvetfoot-fall.  As we crossed the shaft of light a door opened withinsix feet of the window.  A man in Arab deshabille with a redtarboosh awry, thrust out his head and drew it in again quickly."Is that the American?" he asked.  He held the door so that hecould slam it in our faces if required.The guide made no answer.  I gave my name.  The man opened thedoor wider."Lailtak sa'idi, effendi!  Hishkur Allah!  Come in, mister!"  Theguide led the donkeys away to some invisible place.  I crossedthe threshold, my host holding his tin lantern carefully to showthe two steps leading down to a flag-stone floor.  He bolted thedoor the moment I was inside.  He seemed in a great state ofexcitement, and afraid to make any noise.  Even when he shot thebolt he did it silently.It was a square room, moderately clean, furnished only with atable and two chairs.  There were other rooms leading off it, butthe stone partitions did not reach as high as the thatch and Icould hear rustling, and some one snoring.  I sat on one of thechairs at his invitation, and rather hoped for supper, having hadnone.  But supper was not in his mind;  it seemed he had too muchelse to worry him.  He looked like a man who worried easily, andlikely enough with good reason, for his long nose and narrow eyesdid not suggest honesty."There was to be an escort to meet me here," I said."Yes, yes.  Thank God, mister, you have come at last.  If you hadonly come at sunset!  Ali has gone to bring them now.""Who is Ali?""He with one eye.  He who brought you.  Your escort came atsunset.  Because I am Christian they would not listen to me orwait for you in my house.  There are twenty of them, led byAnazeh, who is a bad rascal.  They have gone to raid thevillages.  There has been trouble.  I have heard two shots fired.Now they will come back to my house, and if the Sikh patrol isafter them they will be caught here, and I shall be accused ofhelping them.  May the fires of their lying Prophet's Eblisburn Anazeh and his men forever and ever, Amen!  May God cursetheir religion!"That was a nice state of affairs.  I did not want to be caughtthere by a lot of truculent Sikhs under one of those jocularlyincredulous young British subalterns that Sikhs adore.  In thefirst place, I had nothing whatever in writing to prove myinnocence.  The least that was likely to happen would be anignominious return to Jerusalem, after a night in a guard-house,should there be a guard-house;  failing that, a night in the openwithin easy reach of Sikh's bayonets.  In Jerusalem, no doubt,Sir Louis would order me released immediately.  But it began tolook as if the whole mystery after all was nothing but a well-staged decoy, using me for bait.  Not even tadpoles enjoy beingused for live-bait without being consulted first.  I began tospear about for remedies."If you're an honest man," I said, "you'd better simply deny allconnection with the raid.""Hah?"He shrugged his shoulders.  He did not look like an honest man.He wasn't one.  He knew it.  He retorted gloomily:"Anazeh's scoundrels will have raided sheep, and perhaps cattle.If any one has resisted them, there will be wailing widows cryingout for vengeance.  They will put the sheep and cattle in theirboats in which they came over the sea this afternoon.  The boatswill be found by the Sikhs, hauled up on the sand-pit just belowmy house, with my motor-boat beside them.  I am ruined!"Well, my own predicament was better than that.  Nobody was likelyto accuse me of having stolen sheep.  But I could not feel sorryfor my host, because he was so sorry for himself.  He was one ofthose unfortunates who carry the conviction of their own guilt intheir faces.  I gave up all idea of relying on him in case theSikhs should come.My next idea was to ask for the loan of one of the donkeys, andto start back toward Jerusalem.  But I had not more than thoughtof it when men's footsteps pattered on the yard dung, and anindubitable rifle-butt beat on the wooden door."For God's sake!" hissed the owner of the place.  He ran to thedoor to open it as the thumping grew louder.  As he drew the boltsomebody kicked the door open, sending him reeling backwards.For a second I thought the Sikhs had come.But he was nothing like a Sikh who strode in, with a dozenruffians at his tail and one-eyed Ali bringing up the rear.  Hewas one of the finest-looking Arabs I had ever seen, althoughconsiderably past fifty and wrinkled so that his face was a net-work of fine lines, out of which his big, dark eyes shone withunaged intelligence.  He was magnificently dressed, perhaps inorder to do me honour.  Except for the fact that he carried amodern military rifle on his elbow, in place of a shepherd'scrook or a spear, he looked like one of those historic worthieswho stalk through the pages of the Pentateuch.  The dignity andcharm with which he bowed to me were inimitable--unconveyable.But he turned on my Christian host like a prophet of oldrebuking blasphemy.Arabic when the right man uses it sounds like tooth-for-a-toothlaw being laid down.  Hebrew is all music and soft vowels;Arabic all guttural consonants.  The Sheikh Anazeh (there was nodoubt of his identity;  they all kept calling him by name)fulminated.  The other bleated at him.  I learned his name atlast.  Ali of the one eye pressed forward, took him by thesleeve, and called him Ahmed.  Ali seemed to be adding persuasionto Anazeh's threats.  Whatever it was they were driving at, Ahmedbegan to look like yielding.  So, as I could not untangle morethan one brief sentence at a time from all those gallopingarguments, I pulled Ahmed away into a corner."What do they all want?" I asked him.  "Tell me in ten words."But he was not a brief man."They say the Sikhs are after them.  They have put the stolensheep into their boats, as I told you they would, mister.  Nowthey order me to tow them with my motor-boat.  But it cannot bedone, mister, it cannot be done!  I tell them there is governmentlaunch near Jericho that the Sikh patrol can use to overtake us.I have a swift boat, but if I take in tow two other loaded boatswe shall be caught;  and then who will save everything I havefrom confiscation?""How close are the Sikhs?" I asked."God knows, mister!  They can come fast.  Unless I consent to letthem use my boat, Anazeh will order his men to kill me, and thenthey will take the boat in any case!  There is only one thing:they must leave the sheep behind and all crowd into my boat, butI cannot persuade them!"At that moment another of Anazeh's party burst in through thedoor.  He evidently bore bad news.  Catching sight of me, helowered his voice to a whisper, and, whatever he said, Anazehnodded gravely.  Then the old sheikh gave an order, and four ofhis men came without further ado to seize Ahmed."Bear me witness!" the wretched man called back to me as theydragged him off.  "I go under protest--most unwillingly!"Somebody struck him with a butt-end.  A woman's head appearedover the top of the partition, and began to jabber noisily.Several of Anazeh's men hurled jests:  the highest complimentthey paid her was to call her Um-Kulsum, the mother of sin.Anazeh beckoned to me.  He did not seem to doubt for an instantthat I would follow him.I was in no mind to wait there and be arrested by the Sikhpatrol.  I wondered whether they were coming in open order,combing the countryside, or heading all together straight for aknown objective;  and whether in either case I could give themthe slip and head back toward Jerusalem.  In that minute Irecalled Grim's advice:"Do whatever the leader of the escort tells you and you'll be allright.  You needn't be afraid to trust him."That settled it.  I did not suppose for a minute that Grim hadcontemplated any such contingency as this;  but he hadvolunteered the advice, so the consequences would be his affair.I followed Anazeh into outer darkness, and one of his men pulledthe door to after me.There was something very like a panic down by the waterside,three hundred yards away from the house.  It needed all Anazeh'sauthority to straighten matters out.  There were dividedcounsels;  and the raiders were working at a disadvantage intotal darkness;  the shadow of the hills fell just beyond thestern of the boats as they lay with their bows ashore.They had already forced Ahmed into his own motor-boat, where hewas struggling vainly to crank a cold engine.  Some of the otherswere trying to push off a boat full of bleating sheep.  One manwas carrying a fat sheep in his arms toward the motor-boat,splashing knee-deep in the water and shouting advice to everybodyelse, and in the end that was the only piece of plunder they gotaway with.  Suddenly one man, who had been left behind to keep alook-out, came leaping like a ghost among the shadows, shoutingthe one word "askeri!" (Soldiers!)  He jumped straight into themotor-boat.  Anazeh bullied all the rest in after him.  I climbedin over the bow.  By that time you could not have crowded in onemore passenger with the aid of a battering ram."Yalla!" barked Anazeh.  But the engine would not start.  Blood-curdling threats were hurled at the unhappy Ahmed.  Some e of themen got into the water and began to shove off, as if the enginecould be encouraged by collaboration.I was just as keen to escape as any one.  I could not imagine aSikh or subaltern stupid enough to believe me innocent.  It was amilitary government.  Soldiers have a drum-head method of leavingnothing to discuss except where the corpse is to be buried.I forced my way aft--got some gasoline out of the tank into a tincup--thrust aside Ahmed and two other men--and primed the engineliberally.  The engine coughed next time they moved the wheel,and in thirty seconds more we had it going.  Ahmed came in for avolley of mockery for having to be shown the way to start hisengine;  but from the sour way he looked at me I was nearly surehe had stalled deliberately.We backed away from shore, and Anazeh steered the boat's noseeastward.  Then somebody at the reversing lever threw it forwardtoo suddenly, and the still chilled engine stopped.  It tookabout another minute to restart it.  We were just beginning togain speed when some one shouted.  All eyes turned toward theshore, the overloaded boat rocking dangerously as the crowd benttheir bodies all in one direction together.Down near the shore-line an electric torch flashed on theuniforms of half-a-dozen Sikhs, and we could hear an unmistakablyBritish voice shouting an order.We were out in the moonlight now, a perfect target.  Bulletschanced at us could hardly fail to hit somebody.  Two or threewell-placed shots might sink us.  But Anazeh had presence ofmind.  He changed helm, so as to present us end-on to the shore.Low in the water though the boat was, we were beginning to makegood headway.The Sikhs lost no time.  Shots began to whizz overhead and tosplash the water around us.  But the boat was painted gray;  aswe increased the distance we must have looked like a moving patchof darker water with a puzzling wake behind us.  The sea wasstill.  The stars were reflected in it in unsteady dots andstreaks.  The moon cast a silver patch of light that shimmered,and confused the eye.  Sikhs are not by any means all marksmen.At any rate, the shots all missed.  Though some of our party,Anazeh included, returned the fire, none boasted of having hitany one.  And an Arab boasts at the least excuse.In a few minutes we were out of range and, since there was nopursuing launch in sight, could afford to jeer at the Sikhs inchorus.  There were things said about their habits and theirancestry that it is to be hoped they did not hear, or at any rateunderstand, for the sake of any Arab prisoners they might take infuture.  It always struck me as a fool game to mock your enemy.If you fall in his power at any time he would be almost more thanhuman if he did not remember it.  It seemed to me unlikely thatthose Sikhs would forget to avenge the Arab compliments that musthave sizzled in ears across that star-lit sea.  After that theonly immediate danger was from the wind that sometimes blows downin sudden gusts from between the mountain-tops.  It would haveneeded only half a sea to swamp us.  But the Dead Sea was livingup to its reputation, quiet, inert, like a mercury mirror for thestars--a brooding place of silence.The Arabs' spirits rose as we chugged toward their savage hills.They began to sing glorious songs about women and mares andcamels.  Presently Anazeh improvised an epic about the night'sraid, abortive though it had been.  He left out all thedisappointing part.  He sang first of the three shore-dwellingfools whose boats they had stolen.  Then of the baffled rage ofthose same fools when they should learn their property was lostforever.  Presently, as he warmed to the spirit of the thing, hesang about the wails of the frightened villagers from whom theyhad plundered sheep and goats;  and of the skill andresourcefulness with which the party had escaped pursuit underhis leadership, Allah favoring, "and blessed be His Prophet!"Last, he sang about me, the honoured stranger, for whom they haddared everything and conquered, and whom they were taking to El-Kerak.  He described me as a prince from a far country, the sonof a hundred kings.It was a good song.  I got Ahmed to translate it to meafterwards.  But I suspect that Ahmed toned it down in deferenceto what he may have thought might be my modesty and moralisticscruples.Chapter Four"I am willing to use all means--all methods."Ahmed knew the Dead Sea.  He knew its moods and a few of itstricks, so he was suitably scared.  He was more of raid of thetreacherous sea than of his captors.  They weren't treacherous inthe least.  They were frankly disobedient of any law except theirown;  respectful of nothing but bullets, brains and their owninterpretation of the Will of Allah.  They showed sublimeindifference to danger that always comes of ignorance.  Ahmed wasfor running straight across to cut the voyage short, because ofthe wind that sometimes blows from the south at dawn.  He said itmight kick up a sea that would roll us over, for the weight ofthe Dead Sea waves in a blow is prodigious.They overruled his protest with loud-lunged unanimity and lots ofabuse.  Anazeh continued to steer a diagonal course for a notchin the Moab Hills that look, until you get quite close to them,as if they rose sheer out of the sea.  The old chief was prettyamateurish at the helm, whatever his other attainments.  Our wakewas like a drunkard's.What with the danger in that overcrowded boat, and the manifestlycompromising fact that I had now become one of a gang who boastedof the murder they had done that night, I did some speculationthat seems ridiculous now, at this distance, after a lapse oftime.  It occurred to me that Grim might be disguised as a memberof Anazeh's party.  As far as possible in the dark I thoroughlyscrutinized each individual.  It is easy to laugh about it now,but I actually made my way to Anazeh's side and tried to discoverwhether the old Sheikh's wrinkles and gray-shot beard were not avery skillfully done make-up.  At any rate, I got from thatabsurd investigation the sure knowledge that Grim was not in theboat with us.I could not talk with Anazeh very well, because when he tried tounderstand my amateurish Arabic and to modify his flow of statelyspeech to meet my needs, he always put his head down, and thehelm with it.  It seemed wisest to let him do one unaccustomedthing at a time.  I did not care to try to talk with any of hismen, because that might possibly have been a breach of etiquette.Arab jealousy is about as quick as fulminate of mercury:  asunreasonable, from a western viewpoint, as a love-sick woman's.But there did not seem any objection to talking with Ahmed.  Hewas at least in theory my co-religionist, and not a person anyMoslem in that boat was likely to be jealous of.  He jumpedat the notion of making friends with me.  He made no secret ofthe reason."You are safe, effendi.  They will neither rob you, nor kill you,nor let you get killed.  You are their guest.  But as for me,they would cut my throat as readily as that sheep's, moreespecially since they have discovered that you know how to startthe engine.  My best chance was to make them believe that theengine is difficult to understand.  Because of your knowledgethey now feel independent of me.  So I must yield to them ineverything.  And if they force me to swear on a Bible, and on myfather's honour, and in the name of God, that I will not giveevidence against them, I shall have to swear.""An oath given under compulsion--" I began.  But he laughedcynically."Ah!  You do not know this land--these folk, effendi.  If I wereto break such an oath as that, they would burn my house, steal mycattle, ravish my wife, and hunt me to the death.  If I ran awayto America, Arabs in Chicago and New York would continue thehunt.  This is a land where an oath is binding, unless you arethe stronger.  I am weak--an unimportant person.""What is your business?" I asked."There is no business for a man like me.  The regulations forbidcommerce in the only goods for which there is a real demandamong Bedouins.""So you're a smuggler, eh?"He laughed, between pride and caution, and changed the subject."I shall do what they order me, effendi.  I think they will keepmy boat over there to bring you back again.  But when I get backthe Sikhs will arrest me.  So I ask you to bear me witness that Iwas compelled by threats and force to go with these people.  Inthat way, with a little ingenuity--that is to say, the ingenioususe of piastras--perhaps I can contrive to get out of thedifficulty without being punished by both Arabs and British."I promised to tell no more than I had seen and heard.  On thestrength of that we became as fast friends as suspicionpermitted.  We trusted each other, because we more or less hadto, like a couple of thieves "on the lam."  It suited me.  He wasa very good interpreter and slavishly anxious to please.  But Ilived to regret it later.  When my evidence had cleared him ofcollusion in the raid, he chose on the strength of that to claimme as his friend for life.  He turned up in the United States andtried to live on his wits.  I had to pay a lawyer to defend himin Federal Court.  He writes me piously pathetic letters fromLeavenworth Penitentiary.  And when he gets out I suppose Ishall have to befriend him again.  However, at the moment, hewas useful.It was just dawn when old Anazeh ran the launch into a covebetween high rocks.  Ahmed let out a shriek of anguish at theviolence done the hull.  They pitched the sheep overboard towade ashore without remembering to untie its legs;  it wasalmost drowned before it occurred to any one to rescue it.Perhaps it was dead.  I don't know.  Anyhow, one fellow prayedin a hurry while his companion cut the sheep's throat to makeit lawful meat."God is good," old Anazeh remarked to me, "and blessed be HisProphet, who forbade us faithful, even though we hunger, todefile ourselves with the flesh of creatures whose blood did notflow from the knife of the slayer."After that they all prayed, going first into the oily-feeling,asphaltic water for the ceremonial washing.  They were quiteparticular about it.  Then they spread prayer-mats, facing Mecca.Every single cut-throat had brought along his prayer-mat, and hadtreasured it as carefully as his rifle.Ahmed and I sat on a rock and watched them.  Ahmed pretended hewanted to pray, too.  To impress me, he said he was a very devoutChristian and that nothing should prevent the practice of hisreligion.  But he was very quick to take my advice not to startanything that might bring on a breach of the peace.  Old Anazeh'sshort preliminary sermon to his followers, about the need ofalways keeping God in mind, was not addressed to us.Prayers finished, they proceeded to cut up and cook the sheep.Ahmed and I subdued the voice of conscience without noticeableeffort and ate our share of the stolen goods.  Ahmed said that,seeing how little was left for him when the rest had all beenserved, he sinned only in small degree, but that my share, as anhonoured guest, was huge, and the sin proportionate.  So I gavehim some of my meat, and he ate it, and we were equally sinful--one more bond cementing an "eternal friendship!"We had hardly finished eating when an Arab on a gray horse cameriding furiously down a ravine that looked like a dry water-course.  He was brought up all-standing fifty yards away.  Everyman in the party leveled a rifle at him.  Anazeh beckoned me tocome and get behind him for protection.  He was very angry when Irefused.  He cursed the language and religion of whatever foolhad taught me manners in a land where pigs are lawful food.However, after they had all had a good look at the horseman theylet him draw near, and there followed a noisy conference, the manon the horse calling on Allah repeatedly with emphasis, andAnazeh and his followers all doing the same thing, but from anopposing viewpoint.  I persuaded Ahmed to go up close and listen."The man is from El-Kerak," he said presently, while they allstill fought with words, using tremendous oaths by way ofartillery.  "A council of the tribes has been summoned, to meetat El-Kerak, but each sheikh is only to take two men with him,because of the risk of fighting among themselves.  Anazeh saysthere can be no proper council without his being present, andthat he will attend the council;  but as for taking only two men,he has pledged his word to escort you with twenty men to El-Kerak.  He swears that he will carry out that pledge, even shouldhe have to fight the whole way there and back again!"Anazeh suddenly cut short the war of words.  His gesturesuggested that of Joshua who made the sun stand still.  He tosseda curt order to one of his men, who went off at a run toward avillage, whose morning smoke rose blue over a spur of the range amile away.  Then Anazeh sat down to await events, and took nomore notice of the horseman's arguments.  That did not worry thehorseman much.  He kept on arguing.  Every few minutes one ofAnazeh's men would go to him and repeat some tid-bit, as if theold sheikh had not heard it;  but all he got for his pains was agesture of contemptuous dismissal.Ahmed kept growing more and more uncomfortable all the time.  Hehad attended to his boat, making it properly fast and coveringthe engine, under the eyes of four men who were at pains to seethat he did not crank up and desert.  Now he was back beside me,trying to bolster up his own courage by making me afraid."They have determined to take me along with them to prevent mefrom escaping," he complained.  "That man on the horse is sayingthat if more men go with Anazeh than you and two others, therewill certainly be fighting.  And Anazeh answers, he has pledgedhis word.  Can you not say something to persuade Anazeh?"I would rather have tried to persuade a tiger.  Short of knockingthe old raider on the head and standing off his twenty ruffians,I could not imagine a way of turning him from his set purpose.And at that, I had not a weapon of any kind.  I was the goods,and the game old sportsman intended to deliver me, right side up,perhaps, but all in one piece and to the proper consignee."I don't see anything to worry about," said I."Wait till you hear the bullets!" Ahmed answered.  Nevertheless,bullets or no bullets, I did not see what I could do about it.Again I remembered Grim's advice:  "Do what the leader of theescort tells you."  I had begun to feel sorry for Ahmed in spiteof his self-pity, but his fear wasn't contagious and his advicewasn't worth listening to."Effendi, you are Anazeh's guest.  He must do as you demand, ifyou ask in the Name of the Most High.  Tell him, therefore, thatyou have an urgent business in El-Kudz.  Demand that he send youback, with me, in my boat!""You are not his guest.  He would simply shoot you and destroythe boat," I answered.It was not more than half-an-hour before I saw horses coming inour direction from the village.  At sight of them the man on thegray horse lost heart.  With a final burst of eloquence, in whichhe spread his breast to heaven and shook both fists in witnessthat he was absolved and no blood-guilt could rest on his head,he rode away at top speed straight up the ravine down which heoriginally came.The horses proved to be a very mixed lot--some good, some verybad, and some indifferent.  But again they treated me as honouredguest and provided me a mare with four sound legs and nothingmuch the matter except vice.  She came at me with open teethwhen I tried to mount, but four men held her and I climbedaboard, somehow or other.  As a horseman, I am a pretty goodsack of potatoes.That was the worst saddle I ever sat in--and Anazeh's second-best!  The stirrups swung amidships, so to speak, and wheneveryou tried to rest your weight on them for a moment they describedan arc toward the rear.  Moreover, you could not sit well back onthe saddle to balance matters, because of the high cantle.  Theresult, whether you did with stirrups or without them, wastorture, for anybody but an Arab, who has notions of comfort allhis own.They put Ahmed on a wall-eyed scrub that looked unfit to walk,but proved well able to gallop under his light weight.  One ofAnazeh's men took my bag, with a nod to reassure me, and withouta word we were off full-pelt, Anazeh leading with four stalwartswho looked almost as hard-bitten as himself, six men crowding meclosely, and the remainder bringing up the rear.That is the Arab way of doing things--rush and riot to beginwith.  The steepness of the stony ravine we rode up soon reducedthe horses to a walk, after which there was a good deal ofattention to rifle-bolts, and a settling down to the more seriousaspects of the adventure.  The escort began to look sullenlyferocious, as only Arabs can.There was a time, during the Turkish regime before the War, whenCook's Agency took tourists in parties to El-Kerak, and all theprotection necessary was a handful of Turkish soldiers, whosethief employment on the trip was to gather fuel and pitch tents.Some one paid the Arabs to let tourists alone, and they normallydid.  But the War changed all that.  A post-Armistice stranger in1920, with leather boots, was fair quarry for whoever had rifleor knife.We passed by a village or two, tucked into folds in the hills andpolluting the blue sky with a smell of ageing dung, but nothingseemed disposed to happen.  A few men stood behind stone wallsand stared at us sullenly.  The women looked up from theirgrindstones at the doors, covered their faces for convention'ssake, and uncovered them again at once for curiosity.  There wasnothing you could call a road between the villages, only a rockycattle-track that seemed to take the longest possible way betweentwo points;  and nobody seemed to own it, or to be there tochallenge our right of way.But suddenly, after we had passed the third village and werewalking the horses up a shoulder of a steep hill-top, three shotscracked out from in front of us to left and right.  Nobody fell,but if ever there was instantaneous response it happened then.Anazeh and his four galloped forward up-hill, firing as they rodefor the cover of a breast-high ridge.  One man on the off-sidetipped me out of the saddle, so suddenly that I had no chance toprevent him;  another caught me, and two others flung me into ahole behind a stone.  I heard the rear-guard scatter and run.Two men pitched Ahmed down on top of me, for he was valuable,seeing he could run an engine;  and thirty seconds later I peeredout around the rock to get a glimpse of what was happening.There was not a man in sight.  I could see some of the horsesstanding under cover.  The firing was so rapid that it soundedalmost like machine-gun practice.  A hairy arm reached out andpushed my head back, and after that, whenever I made the leastmovement, a man who was sniping from behind the sheltering rockswore furiously, and threatened to brain me with his butt-end.Beyond all doubt they regarded me as perishable freight;  so Ihardly saw any of the fighting.Judging by the sound, I should say they fought their way up-hillin skirmish order, and when they got to the top the enemy--whoever they were--took to flight.  But that is guesswork.  Therewere two casualties on our side.  One man shot through the arm,which did not matter much;  he was well able to lie about whathad happened and to boast of how many men he had slain before thebullet hit him.  The other was wounded pretty seriously in thejaw.  They came to me for first aid, taking it for granted that Iknew something about surgery.  I don't.  I had a bad timebandaging both of them, using two of my handkerchiefs and stripsfrom the protesting Ahmed's shirt.  However, I enjoyed it morethan they did.When Anazeh shouted at last and we all rode to the hilltop therewas a dead man lying there, stripped naked, with his throat cutacross from ear to ear.  One of our men was wiping a long knifeby stabbing it into the dirt.  There was also a led horse addedto the escort.  Anazeh looked very cool and dignified;  he had anextra rifle now, slung by a strap across his shoulders.  He wasexamining a bandolier that had blood on it.We rode on at once, and for the next hour Ahmed was kept busyinterpreting to me the lies invented by every member of theescort for my especial benefit.  If they were true, each man hadslain his dozen;  but nobody would say who the opposing factionwere.  When I put that question they all dried up and nobodywould speak again for several minutes.It turned out afterward that there had been a sort of armisticeproclaimed, and all the local chiefs had undertaken to observe itand cease from blood-feuds for three days, provided that eachchief should prove peaceful intention by bringing with him onlytwo men.  Three men in a party, and not more than three, hadright of way.  The engagement may have been a simple protestagainst breach of the terms of the armistice, but I suspect therewas more than that in it.At any rate, we were not attacked again on the road, although therewere men who showed themselves now and then on inaccessible-lookingcrags, who eyed us suspiciously and made no answer to the shoutedchallenge of Anazeh's men.  When the track passed over a spur, orswung round the shoulder of a cliff, we could sometimes catchsight of other parties--always, though of three, before and behindus, proceeding in the same direction.We sighted the stone walls of El-Kerak at about midafternoon, androde up to the place through a savage gorge that must have beenimpregnable in the old days of bows and arrows.  It would take adetermined army today to force itself through the wadys andwinding water-courses that guard that old citadel of Romansand crusaders.We approached from the Northwest corner, where a tower standsthat they call Burj-ez-Zahir.  There were lions carved on it.  Itlooked as if the battlements had been magnificent at one time;but whatever the Turks become possessed of always falls intodecay, and the Arabs seem no better.Beside the Burj-ez-Zahir is a tunnel, faced by an unquestionableRoman arch.  Outside it there were more than a dozen armed menlounging, and a lot of others looked down at us through theruined loop-holes of the wall above.  Their leader challengedour numbers at once, and refused admission.  Judging by Anazeh'smagnificently insolent reply it looked at first as if heintended fighting his way in.  But that turned out to beonly his diplomatic manner--establishing himself, as it were,on an eminence from which he could make concessions withoutlosing dignity.The arrangement finally agreed to was Anazeh's suggestion, butshowed diplomatic genius on both sides.  The old man divided uphis party into sets of three, and asserted that every set ofthree was independent.  There were twenty-two of us all told,including Ahmed, but he described Ahmed as a prisoner, andoffered to have him shot if that would simplify matters.There was a great deal of windy discussion about Ahmed's fate,during which his face grew the color of raw liver and he joinedin several times tearfully.  Once he was actually seized andhalf-a-dozen of the castle guards aimed at him;  but theycompromised finally by letting him go in with hands tied.  Nobodyreally wanted the responsibility of shooting a man who hadsmuggled stolen cartridges across the Dead Sea, and might do itagain if allowed to live.We rode for eighty or a hundred paces through an echoing tunnelinto a city of shacks and ruined houses that swarmed with armedmen, and it was evident that we were not the only ones who hadignored the rule about numbers.  Anazeh explained in an asideto me that only those would obey that rule who did not darebreak it."Whoever makes laws should be strong enough to enforce them," hesaid sagely.  "And whoever obeys such a law is at the mercy ofthose who break it," he added presently, by way of afterthought.To make sure that I understood him he repeated that remarkthree times.Every house had its quota of visitors, who lounged in thedoorways and eyed us with mixed insolence and curiosity.  Therewere coffee-booths all over the place that seemed to have beenerected for the occasion, where, under awnings made of stick andstraw, men sat with rifles on their knees.  Those who hadprovender to sell for horses were doing a roaring trade--shortmeasure and high price;  and the noise of grinding was incessant.The women in the back streets were toiling to produce enough toeat for all that host of notables.To have had to hunt for quarters in that town just then wouldhave been no joke.  There was the mosque, of course, where anyMoslem who finds himself stranded may theoretically go and sleepon a mat on the floor.  But we rode past the mosque.  It wasfull.  I would not have liked a contract to crowd one more inthere.  Perhaps a New York Subway guard could have managed it.The babel coming through the open door was like the buzzing offlies on a garbage heap.I was trying to sit upright in that abominable saddle and lookdignified, as became the honoured guest with a twenty-man escort,when a courteous-looking cut-throat wearing an amber necklaceworth a wheat-field, forced his way through a crowd and greetedAnazeh like a long lost brother.  I examined him narrowly to makesure he was not Grim in disguise, but he had two fingers missing,and holes in his ears, which decided that question.After he had welcomed me effusively he led us through a rat-runmaze of streets to a good-sized house with snub-nosed lionscarved on the stone doorposts and a lot of other marks of bothRoman and crusader.  No part of the walls was less than threefeet thick, although the upper story had been rebuilt ratherrecently on a more economical and much less dignified scale.Nevertheless, there was a sort of semi-European air about theplace, helped out by two casemented projections overhanging thenarrow street.There was no need to announce ourselves.  The clatter of hoofsand shouts to ordinary folk on foot to get out of the way haddone that already.  Sheikh ben Nazir opened the door in person.His welcome to me was the sort that comes to mind when you readthe Bible story of the prodigal son returning from a far-offcountry.  I might have been his blood-relation.  But perhaps I amwrong about that;  bloodfeuds among blood-relations arenotoriously savage.  He was the host, and I the guest.  Amonggenuine Arabs that is the most binding relation there is.He was no longer in blue serge and patent-leather boots, butmagnificent in Arab finery, and he was tricked out in a  puzzlingsnowy-white head-dress that suggested politics without yourknowing why.  He had told me, when I met him at the AmericanColony, that he had made the pilgrimage to Mecca more than once;but that white linen thing had nothing to do with his being ahaji, any more than the expensive rings on the fingers of bothhands had anything to do with his Arab nationality.After he had flattered and questioned me sufficiently about thejourney to comply with etiquette I asked him whether Ahmed mightnot be untied.  The thong cutting the man's wrists. Sheikh henNazir gave the necessary order and it was obeyed at once.  Theliquid-eyed rascal with the priceless amber necklace then ledaway the escort, Ahmed included, to some place where they couldstall the horses, and--side-by-side, lest any question ofprecedence should be involved, Anazeh and I followed ben Nazirinto the house.We were not the only guests there.  He ushered us into a squareroom, in which outrageous imported furniture, with gilt andtassels on it, stood out like loathsome sores against rugs andcushions fit for the great Haroun-al-Raschid's throne room.  Anygood museum in the world would have competed to possess the rugs,but the furniture was the sort that France sends eastward in thename of "culture"--stuff for "savages" to sit on and be civilizedwhile the white man bears the burden and collects the money.There were half-a-dozen Arabs reclining on two bastard Louis-something-or-other settees, who rose to their feet as we entered.There was another man, sitting on a cushion in a corner byhimself, who did not get up.  He wore a white head-dress exactlylike our host's, and seemed to consider himself somebody veryimportant indeed.  After one swift searching glance at us he wentinto a brown study, as if a mere sheikh and a Christian alienwere beneath his notice.We were introduced first of all to the men who had stood up togreet us, and that ceremony took about five minutes.  The Arabbelieves he ought to know all about how you feel physically, andexpects you to reciprocate.  When that was over ben Nazir took usto the corner and presented, first me, then Anazeh to thesolitary man in the white head-dress, who seemed to think himselftoo important to trouble about manners.Anazeh did not quite like my receiving attention first, and heliked still less the off-handed way in which the solitary manreceived us.  We were told his name was Suliman ben Saoud.  Heacknowledged my greeting.  He and old Anazeh glared at eachother, barely moving their heads in what might have been anunspoken threat and retort or a nod of natural recognition.Anazeh turned on his heel and joined the other guests.In some vague way I knew that Saoud was a name to conjurewith, although memory refused to place it.  The man's air ofindifference and apparently unstudied insolence suggested he wassome one well used to authority.  Presuming on the one thing thatI felt quite sure of by that time--my privileged position as aguest--I stayed, to try to draw him out.  I tried to open upconversation with him with English, French, and finally lameArabic.  He took no apparent notice of the French and English,but he smiled sarcastically at my efforts with his own tongue.Except that he moved his lips he made no answer but went onclicking the beads of a splendid amber rosary.Ben Nazir, seeming to think that Anazeh's ruffled feelings calledfor smoothing, crossed the room to engage him in conversation, soI was left practically alone with the strange individual.  Moreor less in a spirit of defiance of his claim to such distinction,I sat down on a cushion beside him.He was a peculiar-looking man.  The lower part of his cheek--thatside on which I sat--was sunk in, as if he had no teeth there.The effect was to give his whole face a twisted appearance.  Thegreater part of his head, of course, was concealed by the flowingwhite kaffiyi, but his skin was considerably darker than that ofthe   Palestine Arab.  He had no eyebrows at all, having shavedthem off--for a vow I supposed.  Instead of making him lookcomical, as you might expect, it gave him a very sinisterappearance, which was increased by his generally surly attitude.Once again, as when I had entered the room, he turned his head togive me one swift, minutely searching glance, and then turned hiseyes away as if he had no further interest.  They were quiteextraordinary eyes, brimful of alert intelligence;  and whereasfrom his general appearance I should have set him down atsomewhere between forty and fifty, his eyes suggested youth, orelse that keen, unpeaceful spirit that never ages.I tried him again in Arabic, but he answered without looking atme, in a dialect I had never heard before.  So I offered him agold-tipped cigarette, that being a universal language.  Hewaived the offer aside with something between astonishment anddisdain.  He had lean, long-fingered hands, entirely unlikethose of the desert fraternity, who live too hard and fighttoo frequently to have soft, uncalloused skin and unbrokenfinger-nails.He did not exactly fascinate me.  His self-containment wasannoying.  It seemed intended to convey an intellectual and moralimportance that I was not disposed to concede without knowingmore about him.  I suppose an Arab feels the same sensation whena Westerner lords it over him on highly moral grounds.  At anyrate, something or other in the way of pique urged me to stir himout of his self-complacency, just as one feels urged to prod abull-frog to watch him jump.He seemed to understand my remarks, for he took no trouble tohide his amusement at my efforts with the language.  But heonly answered in monosyllables, and I could not understandthose.  So after about five minutes I gave it up, and crossedthe room to ben Nazir, who seized the opportunity to show memy sleeping-quarters.It proved to be a room like a monastery cell, up one flight ofstone steps, with two other rooms of about the same size oneither side of it.  At the end of the passage was a very heavywooden door, with an iron lock and an enormous keyhole, which Isuppose shut off the harem from the rest of the house;  but as Inever trespassed beyond it I don't know.  I only do know that awoman's eye was watching me through that key-hole, and ben Nazirfrowned impatiently at the sound of female giggling."The Sheikh Anazeh will have the room on this side of you," hesaid, "and the Sheikh Suliman ben Saoud the room on the other.So you will be between friends.""Suliman ben Saoud seems a difficult person to make friendswith," I answered.Ben Nazir smiled like a prince out of a picture-book--beautifulwhite teeth and exquisite benignance."Oh, you mustn't mind him.  These celebrities from the centre ofArabia give themselves great airs.  To do that is consideredevidence of piety and wisdom."I sat on the bed--quite a civilized affair, spotlessly clean.Ben Nazir took the chair, I suppose, like the considerate host hewas, to give me the sensation of receiving in my own room."He wears the same sort of head-dress you do.  What does itmean?" I asked."I wear mine out of compliment to him--not that I have notalways the right to wear it.  It is the Ichwan head-dress.It is highly significant.""Of what?"He hesitated for a moment, and then seemed to make up his mindthat it did not much matter what he might divulge to an ignorantstranger soon to return to the United States."It is difficult to explain.  You Americans know so little of ourpolitics.  It is significant, I might say, of the New Arabia--Arabia for the Arabs.  The great ben Saoud, who is a relative ofthis man, is an Arabian chieftain who has welded most of Arabiainto one, and now challenges King Hussein of Mecca for thecaliphate.  Hussein is only kept on his throne by British gold,paid to him from India.  Ben Saoud also receives a subsidy fromthe British, who must continue to pay it, because otherwise benSaoud will attack Hussein and overwhelm him.  That, it isbelieved, would mean a rising of all the Moslem world againsttheir rulers--in Africa--Asia--India--Java--everywhere.  It beganas a religious movement.  It is now political--although it isheld together by religious zeal.  You might say that the Ichwansare the modern Protestants of Islam.  They are fanatical.  Theworld has never seen such fanaticism, and the movement spreadsday by day.""You don't look like a fanatic," I said, and he laughed again."I?  God forbid!  But I am a politician;  and to succeed apolitician must have friends among all parties.  My one ambitionis to see all Arabs united in an independent state reaching fromthis coast to the Persian Gulf.  To that end I devote my energy.I use all means available--including money paid me by the French,who have no intention of permitting any such development if theycan help it.""And the British?""For the present we must make use of them also.  But their yokemust go, eventually.""Then if America had accepted the Near East mandate, you wouldhave used us in the same way?""Certainly.  That would have been the easiest way, becauseAmerica understands little or nothing of our politics.  America'smoney--America's schools and hospitals--America's war munitions--and then good-bye.  I am willing to use all means--all methods tothe one end--Arabia for the Arabs.  After that I am willing toretire into oblivion."Nevertheless, ben Nazir did not convince me that he was analtruist who had no private ends to serve.  There was anavaricious gleam in ben Nazir's eyes.Chapter Five"D'you mind if I use You?"For all his care to seem hospitable before any otherconsideration, ben Nazir looked ill at ease.  He led me downagain to a dining-room hung with spears, shields, scimitars andancient pistols, but furnished otherwise like an instalment-planapartment.  He watched while a man set food before me.  It seemedthat Anazeh had gone away somewhere to eat with his men.Ben Nazir's restlessness became so obvious that I asked at lastwhether I was not detaining him.  He jumped at the opening.  Withprofound apologies he asked me to excuse him for the remainder ofthe afternoon."You see," he explained, "I came from Damascus to Jerusalem, so Iwas rather out of touch with what was going on here.  Thisconference of notables was rather a surprise to me.  It will notreally take place until tomorrow, but there are important detailsto attend to in advance.  If you could amuse yourself--"The man who could not do that in a crusader city, crammed withsons of Ishmael who looked as if they had stepped out of thepages of the Old Testament, would be difficult to please.  Iasked for Ahmed, to act as interpreter.  Ben Nazir volunteered toprovide me with two men in addition as a sort of bodyguard."Because Ahmed is a person who is not respected."It did not take ten minutes to produce Ahmed and the two men.The latter were six-foot, solemn veterans armed with riflesand long knives.  With them at my heels I set out to exploreEl-Kerak."There is nothing to see," said Ahmed, who did not want to come.But Ahmed was a liar.  There was everything to see.  The onlydefinite purpose I had in mind was to find Grim.  It was possibleI might recognize him even through his disguise.  Failing that,he could not help but notice me if I walked about enough;  if so,he would find his own means of establishing communication.But you might as well have hunted for one particular pebble on abeach as for a single individual in all that throng.  RememberingGrim's disguise when I first saw him, I naturally had thatpicture of him in mind.  But all the Bedouins looked about asmuch alike as peas in a pod.  They stared at me as if I were acurio on exhibition, but they did not like being stared back at.There was no hint of violence or interference, and no apparentresentment of an alien's presence in their midst.  The loud-lunged bodyguard shouted out to all and sundry to make way forthe "Amerikani," and way was made forthwith, although severaltimes the bodyguard was stopped and questioned after I hadpassed, to make sure I was really American and not English.Ahmed assured me that if I had been English they would have"massacred" me.  In view of what transpired he may have beenright, though I doubt it.  They might have held me as hostage.Not that they were in any kind of over-tolerant mood.  There wasa man's dead body hanging by one foot from a great hook on a highwall, and the wall was splattered with blood and chipped bybullets.  I asked Ahmed what kind of criminal he might be."He did not agree with them.  They are for war.  He was in favorof peace, and he made a speech two hours ago.  So they accusedhim of being a traitor, and he was tried and condemned.""Who tried him?""Everybody did.""War with whom?" I asked."The British.""Why?""Because they favor the Zionists.""And that is what the conference is all about?""Yes.  There is a man here from Damascus, who urges them to raidacross the Jordan into Palestine.  He says that the PalestinianArabs will rise then, and cut the throats of all the  Zionists.He says that Emir Feisul is going to attack the French in Syria,and that the British will have to go and help the French, so nowis the time for a raid.""Is my host, ben Nazir, the man who is talking that way?  He hasbeen to Damascus.""No.  Another, named Abdul Ali--a very rich sheikh, who comeshere often with caravans of merchandise, and gives rich presentsto notables.""Has ben Nazir anything to do with it?""Who knows?  Mashallah!  The world is full of mysteries.  ThatNazir is a knowing one.  They say of him:  whichever option isuppermost, that is always his opinion.  He is a safe man tofollow for that reason.  Yet it is easier to follow water througha channel underground."We made our way toward the castle at the south side of the town,but were prevented from entering by a guard of feudal retainers,who looked as if they had been well drilled.  They were as solemnas the vultures that sat perched along the rampart overlooking agreat artificial moat dividing the town from the high hill justbeyond it.Nobody interfered when I climbed on the broken town wall andlooked over.  The castle wall sloped down steeply into the moat,suggesting ample space within for dungeons and undergroundpassages;  but there was nothing else there of much interest tosee, only dead donkeys, a dying camel with the vultures alreadybeginning on him, some dead dogs, heaps of refuse, and a lot morevultures too gorged to fly--the usual Arab scheme of sanitation.I asked one of my bodyguard to shoot the camel and he obliged me,with the air of a keeper making concessions to a lunatic.  Nobodytook any notice of the rifle going off.It was when we turned back into the town again that the firstinkling of Grim's presence in the place turned up.  A bulky-looking Arab in a sheepskin coat that stank of sweat so vilelythat you could hardly bear the man near you, came up and stood inmy way.  Barring the smell, he was a winning-looking rascal--truculent, swaggering, but possessed of a good-natured smile thatseemed to say:  "Sure, I'm a rogue and a liar, but what else didyou expect!"He spoke perfectly good English.  He said he wished to speak tome alone.  That was easy enough;  Ahmed and the bodyguardwithdrew about ten paces, and he and I stepped into a doorway."I am Mahommed ben Hamza," he said, with his head on one side, asif that explanation ought to make everything clear to me at once."From Hebron," he added, when I did not seem to see the light.The wiser one looks, and the less one says, in Arab lands, theless trouble there's likely to be.  I tried to look extremelywise, and said nothing."Where is Jimgrim?" he demanded."If you can tell me that I'll give you ten piastres," I answered."I will give you fifty if you tell me!""Why do you want to know?""He is my friend.  He said I should see him here.  But I have notseen him.  He said also I should see you.  You are the Amerikani?And you don't know where he is?  Truly?  Then, when you see him,will you say to him, 'Mahommed ben Hamza is here with nine men atthe house of Abu Shamah?'  Jimgrim will understand."I nodded, and the man from Hebron walked away without another word."Did he steal your watch?" asked Ahmed.  They are as jealous aschildren, those Arabs.There was a second execution while I walked back through thecity.  A wide-eyed, panic-stricken poor devil with slobber on hisjaws came tearing down-street with a mob at his heels.  Westepped into an alley to let the race go by, but he doubled downthe alley opposite.  Before he had run twenty yards along it someone hit the back of his head with a piece of rock.  A secondlater they had pounced on him, and in less than a minute afterthat he was kicking in the noose of a hide rope slung over ahouse-beam.  I don't know what they hanged him for.  No oneapparently knew.  But they used his carcase for a target and shotit almost to pieces.I kept on looking for Grim, although the task seemed hopeless.Of course, I could not give a hint of my real purpose.  But asGrim knew that the talk about a school-teacher was my passportto the place, it seemed possible that he might use that as anexcuse for getting in touch with me.  So I told Ahmed to showme the schools.They weren't worth looking at--mere tumble-down sheds in whichMoslem boys were taught to say the Koran by heart.  The placeswhere Christian missionaries once had been were all turned intostores, and even into stables for the horses of the notables.So I returned to ben Nazir's house, and found old Sheikh Anazehsitting outside on the step, as motionless as a tobacco-storeIndian but twice as picturesque.  He still had his own rifle overhis knees, and the plundered one slung over his shoulder by astrap;  he never stirred abroad unarmed.I asked him what the conference of notables was going to beabout, and he told me to mind my own business.  That struck me asan excellent idea, so, not having slept at all the previousnight, I went upstairs and lay on the bed.  There was no lock onthe door, so I set the chair against it.Ben Nazir was a man who had traveled a great deal, and picked upwestern notions of hospitality to add to the inborn eastern senseof sacredness in the relation between host and guest.  It seemsthat an hour or two later he came to take me down to a Gargantuanmeal, but, feeling the chair against the door, and hearingsnores, he decided it was better manners to let me lie in peace.So I did not wake up again until after midnight.  The moonlightwas streaming through a little high-perched window, and fell onthe white-robed, ghostly-looking figure of a man, who sat withcrossed legs on the end of the bed.  I thought I was dead andin hell.That is no picturesque exaggeration about a man's hair standingwhen he is terrified.  It really does.  I would have yelledaloud, if the breath would have come, but there is a trick ofsudden fear that seems to grip your lungs and hold them impotent.The thing on the end of the bed had no eye-brows.  It grinned asif it knew all about evil, and were hungry, and living men wereits food.I don't know how long I stared at the thing, but it seemedlike a week.  At last it spoke, and I burst into a sweat withthe reaction."Good job you don't know how to fasten a door with a chair.  I'llhave to show you that trick, or you'll be dying before your time.Sh-h-h!  Don't make a noise!"I sat up and looked more closely at him.  It was the Ichwan ofthe afternoon--Sheikh Suliman ben Saoud.  And he was speakingunmistakable American.  I began again to believe I was dreaming.He chuckled quietly and lit a cigarette."Aren't you wise to me yet?""Grim?""Who else?""But what's happened to your face?  You're all one-sided.""Oh, that's easy.  I just take out my false teeth.  The rest isdone with a razor and some brown stain.  I thought you were goingto spot me when you first came.  Did you?  I didn't think so.Did you act as well as all that?""No.  Looked all over town for you afterward.""Uh-huh.  I thought that was too natural to be acting.  Pick upany news in town?""Saw a hanging, and met a man who calls himself Mahommed benHamza.  He's waiting at the house of Abu Shamah.""Any men with him?""Nine.""Three more than he promised.  Ben Hamza is the most honest thiefand dependable liar in Palestine--a cheerful murderer who stickscloser than a brother.  I saved him once from being hung, becausehe smiles so nicely.  Any more news?""I expect none that you don't know.  There's a sheikh named AbdulAli from Damascus, preaching a raid into Palestine."Grim nodded."I'm here to bag that bird.""Where do I come in?" I asked."You are the plausible excuse, that's all.  Thanks to you oldAnazeh got into El-Kerak with twenty men.  Two might not havebeen enough, even with ben Hamza and his nine.""Then our host ben Nazir is in on your game?""Not he!  Up at headquarters in Jerusalem we knew all about thiscoming conference.  These folk are ready to explode.  The onlyway to stop it is to pull the plug--The plug is Abdul Ali.  Weknew we could count on old Anazeh.  But the puzzle was how to gethim and his men into El-Kerak.  When you told me ben Nazir hadinvited you, I saw the way to do it.  There wasn't anybody elseexcept Anazeh that ben Nazir could have sent to fetch you, andthe old boy is a dependable friend of ours.""That did not stop him from raiding two villages on the Britishside of the Dead Sea," I answered."Did he?""Sure.  I had part of a raided sheep for breakfast.""Um-m-m!  Well of all the--damn his impudence!  The shrewd olddevil must have figured that we can't get after him for it,seeing how he's playing our game.  Bloody old horse-thief!  Well,he gets away with it, this time.  You'll have to be mightycareful not to seem to recognize me.  One slip and we're donefor.  You're safe enough.  If they once get wise to me they'llpull me in pieces between four horses.""What's your plan?""It's vague yet.  Got to be an opportunist.  I'm supposed tobe a member of the ben Saoud family, recruiting members forthe new sect--biggest thing in Arabia.  I'm invited to theconference on the strength of my supposed connection with thebig Ichwan movement.""D'you propose to murder this Abdul Ali person, then, or have himmurdered?" I asked."Uh-uh!  Murder's out of my line.  Besides, that'ud do no good.Worse than useless.  They'd all cut loose.  Abdul Ali has gotthem together.  What with bribes and a lot of promises he hasthem keen on this raid.  If he were killed they'd say one of ourspies did it.  They'd add vengeance to their other motives, whichat present are mainly a desire for loot.  No, no.  Abdul Ali hasgot to disappear.  Then they'll believe he has betrayed them.Then, instead of raiding Palestine they'll confiscate hisproperty and curse his ancestors.  D'you see the point?""More or less.  But what good can I do?""Do you mind if I use you?"I laughed.  "That's a hell of a silly question.  Any use myminding?  You've already used me.  You will do it again withoutconsulting me.  I like it, as it happens.  But a fat lot youcare whether I like it or not.  Isn't it a bit late in the dayto ask permission?""Oh, well.  You know the hangmen always used to beg the victim'spardon.  Will you obey orders?""Yes.  But it might be easier if I know what I'm doing.""As soon as I know I'll explain," he answered.  "Where you canfit into the puzzle at the moment is by rooting for the schoolidea.  The worst robber chieftain from the farthest cluster ofhuts he calls his home town would like to see an American schoolhere in El-Kerak.  If there were one he'd send his sons to it.""Okay.  I'll root like a dog for a buried bone.""Go to it.  That gives you the right to ask questions.  That willoblige ben Nazir to introduce you to any one you want tointerview.  That will explain without any further argumentwhatever weakness you seem to have for talking to men in thestreet like Mahommed ben Hamza.  It would even explain away anypoliteness that I might show you in my capacity of Ichwan.  Forsafety's sake, and to create an impression, I take the line ofbeing rude to every one;  but I might reasonably toss a fewcrumbs of condescension to an altruist from foreign parts.  Atany rate, I'll have to take that chance.  D'you get me?""You mean, you'll use me as intermediary? Messages to and fromben Hamza and that sort of thing?""That's the idea, but there's more to it.  Did you bring thatBible along?  Are you superstitious?  Any notions like Long JohnSilver's about its being bad luck to spoil a Bible?  All right.Keep it in your pocket to make notes in.  If you can't get thewhole book to me, tear a page out and send that, or give it tome, with the message spelled in dots under the words.  Make thedots faint, I've good eyes.""What sort of notes do you want from me?""You mustn't mistake me for the prophet Ezekiel," he answered,grinning.  "'Thus saith the Lord' is all right when you know whatyou're talking about.  All I know for certain is that I've gotto bag Abdul Ali.  If you get information that looks importantto you, get it to me in the way I've told you, that's all.Don't be caught talking to me.  Don't look friendly.  Don'tseem interested.""What else?""If you can, keep old Anazeh sober.""Oh!"Grim nodded meaningly:  "I've known easier jobs!""The old sport thinks no more of me than of an express packagehe'd been hired to deliver," I answered.  "Drunk or sober, he'dbrush me aside like a fly.""Well--wits were given us to use.  I guess you'll have to useyours.  Have you any?""How the hell should I know?" I retorted."If you find I haven't any, don't blame me.""I won't," he answered, and I believed him."What else besides being dry-nurse to the king of theAmalekites?" I asked."Don't trust Ahmed.""He's a good interpreter.""Yeh--and a poor peg.  You'll have to use him--some.  But don'ttrust him.""Does old Anazeh know you in that disguise?" I asked."No, and he mustn't.  I'll tell you why.  All these people arereligious fanatics.  A horrible death is the only fate they wouldconsider for a man caught masquerading as a holy personage theway I'm doing.  But their fanaticism has a way of petering outwhen the gang's not there to see.  In his own village I thinkAnazeh would laugh if I talked this ruse over with him--afterwards.  But if he knew about it here, with all these otherfanatics alert and fanning, he wouldn't dare not to expose me.It's a good job you asked that.  If I send any message to Anazehthrough you, be sure you don't give me away.""How shall I make him believe the message is from you, then?""Begin with 'Jimgrim says.'  He'll recognize the formula.  But ifhe questions that, say 'A lion knows a lion in the dark.'That'll serve a double purpose--convince him and jog his memory.He ignored a request of mine--once, and I was able to get back athim.  Tell you the story some day.  Nowadays he's more or lessdependable, unless he gets a skin-full of redeye.  Well, make themost of your chance to sleep;  you may have to go short later.I'm going to saw off a cord or two myself."He left the room as silently as a ghost.  I don't doubt that heslept peacefully.  Subsequent acquaintance with him convinced methat he can go to sleep almost anywhere in any circumstances.And that is a very great gift, for it enables its owner to weardown any dozen who must sleep for stated hours at fixedintervals.  Grim snatches his whenever the chance comes, and goeswithout with apparent indifference.  He told me once that hedreams nearly all the time he is asleep.  But the dreams don'tseem to trouble him.  I believe he dreams out the key to whateverproblem puzzles him at the moment.My own sleep was done for that night, his advice notwithstanding.I lay listening to Anazeh's thunderous snores and naturallyenough imagining every possible contingency and dozens that weretotally impossible.  Nothing turned out in the least like any ofmy forecasts;  but that was not for want of trying to foresee itall.  I don't seem to possess any of that quiet gift of waitingto deal with each development on its merits, as and when itcomes.  I have to speculate, and speculation is the ene myof peace.Looking back, I don't think I felt a bit afraid of the immediatefuture;  but that was due to ignorance of nearly all that thepresent held.  I think that was part of Grim's reason for helpingme to reach El-Kerak in the first place;  he counted on myignorance of danger to keep me cool-headed.  It is true, it diddawn on me that if my host were to suspect me of intriguing undercover of his protection, the protection might cease withdisconcerting abruptness.  I realized to some extent what apredicament that would be.  But on the whole, I think the onlyreal worry was the definite task Grim had given me--thethankless, and very likely desperate, inglorious one of trying tokeep old Anazeh sober.Of course, the Koran forbids wine.  But whiskey is not wine.  Andif you mix whiskey and wine together they cease to be either;they become a commodity of which the Prophet knew nothing andwhich he therefore did not forbid.  But if you introduce such amixture into the stomach, and thence into the brain of an alreadyfiery Bedouin;  and then introduce the Bedouin to trouble;  andif, in addition to the trouble, you provide impertinent, alien,and what he calls infidel restraint, it is fair to presume thatthe mixture might explode.It seemed to me I had been given too much to do.  In order to getintroductions to the notables I must first get ben Nazir into aproper frame of mind.  Then, stammering in an alien tongue, Imust make friends with chieftains who had never even heard of me;and that, when their minds were busy with another matter.  I mustkeep in touch with ben Hamza, and convey his messages to Grimwithout being seen or arousing suspicion.  In addition to allthat I must keep sober by some means an old savage armed withtwo rifles and a knife, who had twenty cut-throats at his beckand call!While I pondered the problem in all its impossible bearings, loudsnores to right and left of me, tenor and bass by turns,announced that Jimgrim and Anazeh were as blissfully oblivious tomy worries as the bedbugs were that had come out of hiding anddiscovered me.  I began to feel homesick.Chapter Six"That man will repay study."I got my first shot at Anazeh at dawn, when the muezzin beganwailing over the city;  and I missed badly with both barrels.The old sheikh looked into my room, presumably to see if I wasstill alive, since he had guaranteed to see me safely back againacross the Jordan, before rounding up his rascals for morningprayer.  They prayed together whenever possible, Anazeh keepingcount of their genuflections.You could tell he had been drinking the night before the minutehe thrust his head into the room.  He smelt like the lees of arum barrel, and the rims of his eyes were red.Seeing I was awake he gave me the courteous, full-sounding "Allahysabbhak bilkhair," and I asked him where he had dined the nightbefore.  He mumbled something into his beard that I could notcatch, but he could not have told me much more plainly to go tohell, even in plain English.  However, I had to get a footholdsomewhere, so I said that I had heard that the liquor in El-Kerakwas poisonous.As far as I understood his answer, he implied that it likelywould be poisonous in the sort of place where I would buy it, butthat he, Anazeh, need not be told how to suck eggs by any such agreenhorn as me.I tried him again.  I said that liquor taken in quantity wouldkill a man."So will one bullet!" he answered.  "But, whereas a bullet in thebelly causes pain before death, moiyit ilfadda (aqua fortis)causes pleasure;  and a man dies either way."He turned to go, rattling two rifle-butts against the door, but Ihad one last try to get on terms and said I hoped to see him atbreakfast, or shortly afterward."God is the giver both of eyesight and the things to see," heanswered.  "I go to pray.  God will guide my footsteps afterward."I did not feel I had really made much headway, but I fared ratherbetter with my host downstairs, who either did not pray with suchenthusiasm or else had forestalled the muezzin.  At any rate, hewas waiting for me near a table spread with sweet cakes and goodFrench coffee.  After the usual string of pleasantries he becamesuddenly confidential, over-acting the part a little, as a mandoes who has something rather disagreeable up his sleeve thathe means to spring on you presently."I have been busy since an hour before dawn.  I have beenconsulting with my friend Suliman ben Saoud.  The situation hereis very serious.  As long as you are my guest you are perfectlysafe;  but if I were to send you away, the assembled notablesmight suspect you of being a spy, and might accuse me ofharbouring a spy.  Do you see?  They would suppose you werereturning to Jerusalem with information for the British.  Thatwould have most unpleasant consequences--for both of us!"Clearly, Grim in the guise of ben Saoud had been busy, and it wasup to me to seize my cue alertly.  I was at pains to lookalarmed.  Ben Nazir grew solicitous."Rest assured, you are safe as my guest.  But Suliman ben Saoudwas annoyed to think a stranger should be here at such a time asthis.  He took me to task about you.  He is also my guest, as Ireminded him, but he is a truculent fellow.  He insisted that theassembled notables have the right to satisfaction regarding yourbona fides.  It was no use my saying, as I did repeatedly, that Ipersonally guarantee you.  He asked me how much I know about you.I had to confess that what I actually know amounts to verylittle.""Well?" I said.  "What does the old grouch want?""He thinks that you should be presented to the assembled notablesat noon today.  In fact, he demands that they should catechizeyou regarding your ideas about a school.""I have no objection.""But, I am sorry to have to add this:  it is probable thenotables will insist on your remaining in El-Kerak until afterthat shall have taken place which they have been summoned todecide on.  They will not risk your returning before the--""Before what?""The--ah--they contemplate a raid!""So I'm a prisoner?""No, no!  Mon dieu, what do you think of me!  Even the fanaticalSuliman ben Saoud saw the force of the argument when I spoke ofthe sanctity of any guest here on my invitation.  But he thinks--and I agree with him, that as a precaution you should first callon Sheikh Abdul Ali.  You will find him a very agreeable man, whowill receive you with proper courtesy.  He is here from Damascus,and exercises a great influence.  Once his mind is at ease aboutyou, he will satisfy all the others.  Are you agreeable?""Why not?"So we smoked a cigarette together after the coffee, and then setforth on foot, for the distance was not great, preceded andsurrounded by armed retainers.  I imagine the armed men were morefor the sake of appearance than protection.  Ben Nazir seemedpopular.  But the escort drove other pedestrians out of the wayas roughly as they did the unspeakable dogs that infested everyoffal-heap.  The street that we followed was, of course, the opensewer for the houses on either hand, and its condition was acredit to the mangy curs that so resented our intrusion.Abdul Ali's house, if his it was, was a fairly big squarebuilding near the middle of the town.  It did not look unlike oneof the old-time New York precinct stations, with its big windowsprotected by iron grilles, and a flight of stone steps leading upto a door exactly in the middle of the front wall.There were thirty or forty capable-looking men hanging about theplace.  Abdul Ali owned more than one camel caravan, and everyman connected with the business looked on himself as a member ofone big feudal family.  They were all armed.  Most of them hadmodern rifles.We were admitted into a room that faced on the street, furnishedentirely in the eastern style, except for two gilt chairs againstthe wall.  The walls were hung with carpets and the floor wascovered with Bokhara rugs three deep.No doubt in order to emphasize his own importance, Abdul Ali keptus waiting in that room for ten minutes before he condescended toenter.  But when he did come at last he was at pains to seemagreeable, which was not quite his natural attitude.I had never seen a more offensive personality, although at thefirst glance he did not arouse actual dislike.  Distaste for himdawned, and grew.  He was certainly not physically attractive,although the Syrian Arab costume made him picturesque.  The firstthing I noticed was the fatness of his hands--those of a giver ofdishonest gifts.  When he shook hands you felt in some subtle waythat he was sure your conscience was for sale, that he wouldpurchase it for any reasonable figure, and that he believed hehad plenty of money with which to buy you and all your relatives.He was a little puffy under the eyes, had a firm mouth, ratherthick lips, and his small black moustache was turned up like theKaiser's, which gave him a cockily self-assured appearance.  Forthe rest, he was a rather military-looking person, although hisflowing robe partly concealed that;  stockily rather than heavilybuilt;  and of rather more than middle height.  He wore one ring--asapphire of extraordinary brilliance, of which he was immenselyproud.  When I noticed it he said at once that it had been givenhim by the late Sultan Abdul Hamid.He spoke German from choice, so we conversed in German, whichannoyed ben Nazir, who could not understand a word of it.  Andfrom first to last throughout that interview, and subsequently tothe point where Jimgrim out-maneuvered and out-played him, herelied on the German philosophy of self-assertion that teacheshow to get and keep the upper hand by making yourself believe inyour own super-intelligence and then speaking, acting, makingplans in logical accord with that belief.  It works finely untilsomebody spoils the whole thing by pricking the super-intelligencebladder and letting out all the wind.Although he spoke German, he was not by any means pro-German inhis motives.  He was at pains to make that clear.  Evidently hehad been pro-German once, until he saw the writing on the wall.He was conscious of the need to offset past prejudices beforesuggesting his enormous ability along advanced lines."You come at an interesting time," he said.  "You find us intransition.  Before the War, and almost until the end of it, mostArabs believed in the German destiny.  English gold commanded theallegiance of an Arab army, but every last man in that army wasready to follow the German standard at the proper time.  Thatonly shows how ignorant these people are.  As soon as it becameevident that the Arab destiny lies in the hands of Arabsthemselves most of them immediately began to clamour for anAmerican mandate, because that would give them temporary masterswho could protect them, yet at the same time who would be tooignorant of real conditions to prevent secret preparations for apan-Arabian revolt.  All very absurd, of course."He had no idea how absurd he himself appeared.  He launched intoa tirade designed to make him seem a super-statesman in the eyesof a stranger who did not care what he was.  The more he talkedhimself into a delirium of self-esteem the less his characterimpressed me.  I even ran into the danger of under-estimating himbecause he liked himself so much."I'm here to look into the prospects for a school," I said."Yes, yes.  Very estimable.  You shall have my support."  Hepaused for me to fawn on him, and my neglect to do it spurred himto further self-revelation."You must look to me for support if you hope for success.  Thereis no cohesion here without me.  I am the only man in El-Kerak towhom they all listen, and even I have difficulty in uniting themat times.  But a school is a good idea, and under my auspices youwill succeed."For the moment I thought he suspected me of wanting to teachschool myself.  I hastened to correct the impression:"All I promise to do is to tell people in the States who might beinterested.""Exactly."  He had been coming at this point all along in his ownway.  "So there is no hurry.  It makes no difference that youmust stay in El-Kerak a little longer than you intended.  Youshall be presented to the council of notables under my auspices.In my judgment it is important that you remain here for somelittle time."I suppose the men who can analyze their thoughts, and separatethe wise impulses from the rash ones, are the people whom theworld calls men of destiny and whom history later assigns to itshalls of fame.  The rest of us simply act from pique, prejudice,passion or whatever other emotion is in charge.  I know I did.It was resentment.  It was so immensely disagreeable to bepatronized by this puffy-eyed sensualist that I could not resistthe impulse to argue with him."I don't see the force of that," said I.  "My plans are made toreturn to Jerusalem tomorrow."I could not have done better as it happened.  I suppose there issome theory that has been written down in books to explain howthese things work, at any rate to the satisfaction of the fellowwho wrote the book.  But Grim, referring to it afterward, calledit naked luck.  I would rather agree with Grim than argue withany inky theorist on earth, having seen too many theories upset.Luck looks to me like a sweeter lady, and more worshipful thanany of the goddesses they rename nowadays and then dissect inclinics.  At any rate, by naked luck I prodded Abdul Ali where hekept his supply of mistakes.  Instead of calling my bluff, as hedoubtless should have done, he set out to win me over to hispoint of view.  Whichever way you analyze it in the light ofsubsequent events, the only possible conclusion is that it was myturn to be lucky and Abdul Ali's to make a fool of himself.Nobody could have made a fool of him better than he did."I must dissuade you," he said, trying to hide wilfulness underan unpleasant smile.  "I will offer inducements.""They'll have to be heavy," I said, "to weigh against what I havein mind."He had kept ben Nazir and me standing all this time.  Now heoffered me one of the chairs, took the other himself, andmotioned ben Nazir to a cushion near the window.  A servantbrought in the inevitable coffee and cigarettes.  Then he laid ahand on my knee for special emphasis--a fat, pale, unprincipledhand, with that great sapphire gleaming on the middle finger."It happens that this idea of a school comes just at the rightmoment.  I have been searching my mind for just some such idea tolay before the notables.  As we are talking a language that noneelse here understands, I can safely take you into confidence.  Araid is being planned into British territory."He paused to let that sink in, and tapped my knee with hisdisgusting fingers until I could have struck him from irritation."There is, however, an element of disagreement.  There isuncertainty as to the outcome, in the minds of some of the chiefswho live nearest to the border.  The feeling among them is thatperhaps I am urging them on in order to serve my own ambition attheir expense.  They appreciate the opportunity to loot;  butthey say that the British will hit back afterwards, and they,being nearest to the border, will suffer most;  whereas I standto gain all and to lose nothing.  Very absurd, of course, butthat is their argument.""Surely," I said, "you don't expect me to take my coat off andpreach a jihad against the British?""Im Gotteswillen!  No, no, no!  This is my meaning:  if I can gobefore them with the offer of a school for El-Kerak, which thevery worst scoundrel among them desires with all his ignorantheart;  and if I can produce a distinguished gentleman fromAmerica, present among them on my invitation for the sole purposeof making the arrangements for such a school, that will convincethem that I have their interests really at heart.  Do you see?"Again the irritating fingers drumming on my knee.  I did notanswer for fear of betraying ill-temper."I am a statesman, sir.  I understand the arguments with whichwhole nations may deceive themselves.  I have made it myprofession to detect the trends of thought and the tides ofunrest.  Psychological moments are for me a fascinating study.  Ican recognize them."He laid the fat hand on my shoulder for a change, and tried tolook into my eyes;  but I was watching the edge of a curtain atthe far end of the room."Now, to you, an American, our local dispute means nothing.  Thisraid is no affair of yours.  You wash your hands of it.  You, analtruist, are interested only in a school.  I offer youopportunity, building, subsidy, guarantees.  You reciprocate bygiving me a talking point.  I shall make use of the opportunity.That is settled.  And, let me see, I promised you inducements,didn't I?"He looked, at me and I looked at him.  He waited for a hint ofsome sort, but I made no move to help him out."What shall we say?"I was as interested in the result of his appraisal as he was inmaking it.  Whether complimentary or not, another's calculatedjudgment of your character is a fascinating thing to wait for."I think you will be getting full value.  I shall introduce youto all the notables," he said at last.    "To a man of yourtemperament it will be a privilege to attend the council, and toknow in advance all that is going to happen.  There will be noobjection to that, because it is already decided you will remainin El-Kerak until after the--er--raid.  The notables willunderstand from me that your mouth is sealed until after theevent.  You shall be let into our secrets.  There--is thatnot equitable?"It was shrewd.  I did not believe for a minute that he would letme into all their secrets, but he could not have imagined agreater temptation for me.  Since I would not have taken his wordthat black was not white, I did not hesitate to pretend to agreeto his terms."I must have an interpreter," I said.  "Otherwise I shallunderstand very little.""I will supply you an interpreter--a good one.""No, thank you.  Any man of yours might only tell me what hethought correct for me to hear.  If I'm to get a price for myservices, I want the full price.  I want to hear everything.  Imust be allowed to bring my own interpreter.""Who would he be?""I don't know yet.""That man Ahmed, for instance?  I have been told he is one ofyour party.  Ahmed would do very well.""No, not Ahmed.""Who then?""I will find a man."He hesitated.  If ever a man was reviewing all the possiblecontingencies, murder of me included, behind a mask of superficialcourtesy, that man was he."He should be a man acceptable to the notables," he said at last."I ought to know his name in advance.""I must have unfettered choice, or I won't attend themejlis."  [Council]"Oh, very well. Only the interpreter, too, will have to remainafterward in El-Kerak."I looked at that curtain again, for it was moving in a way thatno draft from the open window could account for.  But at last themovement was explained.  Before Abdul Ali could speak again a manstepped out from behind it, crossed the room, and went outthrough the door, closing it silently behind him.  He was a man Iknew, and the last man I had expected to see in that place.  Isuppose Abdul Ali noticed my look of surprise."You know him?" he asked."By sight.  He was at Sheikh ben Nazir's house yesterday.""That is Suliman ben Saoud, a stranger from Arabia, but a manof great influence because of his connection with the Ichwanmovement.  If you are interested in our types that man willrepay study.""Good.  I'll try to study him," said I.It was all I could do to keep a straight face.  So Jimgrim wasthe source of Abdul Ali's inspirations!  I wondered what subtleargument he could have used to make the sheikh so keen on baitinghis hook with the school proposal.  His nerve, in waiting behindthat curtain until he knew his scheme had succeeded, and thenwalking out bold as brass to let me know that he had overheardeverything, was what amused me.  But I managed not to smile."What time is the mejlis?"  I asked."At noon.""Then I'll go and hunt up my interpreter."Ben Nazir came out with me, in a blazing bad temper.  He was asjealous as a pet dog, and inclined to visit the result on me."Very polite, I am sure!  Most refined!  Most courteous!  In yourcountry, sir, does a guest reward his host for hospitality bytalking in a language that his host can't understand?  Perhapsyou would rather transfer your presence to Abdul Ali's house?Pray do not consider yourself beholden to me, in case you wouldprefer his hospitality!"I tried in vain to pacify him.  I explained that the choice oflanguage had been Abdul Ali's, and offered to tell him now inFrench every word that had passed.  But he would not listen."It would not be difficult for a man of your intelligence to makeup a story," he said rudely."Abdul Ali can talk French.  If it had been intended that Ishould know the truth that conversation would have been inFrench.  Shall I send your bag to Abdul Ali's house?""No," I said.  "Give it to Anazeh.  He is answerable formy safety until I reach Palestine again.  Thank you for anight's lodging."He walked away in a great huff, and I set out for the house ofAbu Shamah, using my scant store of Arabic to ask the way.Mahommed ben Hamza was lolling on the stone veranda, gossipingwith half-a-dozen men.  He came the minute I beckoned him."I've seen Jimgrim," I said.  "You're to come with me at noon tothe mejlis as my interpreter."He grinned delightedly."And see here, you smelly devil:  Here's money.  Buy yourself aclean shirt, a new coat, and some soap.  Wash yourself from headto foot, and put the new clothes on, before you meet me at thecastle gate ten minutes before noon.  Those are Jimgrim's orders,do you understand?""Taht il-amr! (Yours to command)" he answered laughing.I went and bought myself an awful meal at the house of a man whorolled Kabobs between his filthy fingers.Chapter Seven"Who gives orders to me?"The wonderful thing about Moab is that everything happens in astory-book setting, with illustrations by Maxfield Parrish andWyeth and Joe Coll, and all the rest of them, whichever wayyou look.Imagine a blue sky--so clear-blue and pure that you can seeagainst it the very feathers in the tails of wheeling kites, andknow that they are brown, not black.  Imagine all the houses, andthe shacks between them, and the poles on which the burlapawnings hang, painted on flat canvas and stood up against thatinfinite blue.  Stick some vultures in a row along a roof-top--purplish--bronze they'll look between the tiles and sky.  Addyellow camels, gray horses, striped robes, long rifles, and asearching sun-dried smell.  And there you have El-Kerak, fromthe inside.From any point along the broken walls or the castle roof you cansee for fifty miles over scenery invented by the Master-Artist,with the Jordan like a blue worm in the midst of yellow-and-greenhills twiggling into a turquoise sea.The villains stalk on-stage and off again sublimely aware oftheir setting.  The horses prance, the camels saunter, the verystreet-dogs compose themselves for a nap in the golden sun, allin perfect harmony with the piece.  A woman walking with a stonejar on her head (or, just as likely, a kerosene can) looks as ifshe had just stepped out of eternity for the sake of the picture.And not all the kings and kaisers, cardinals and courtezansrolled into one great swaggering splurge of majesty could hold acandle to a ragged Bedouin chief on a flea-bitten pony, on theway to a small-town mejlis.So it was worth a little inconvenience, and quite a little riskto see those chiefs arrive at the castle gate, toss their reinsto a brother cut-throat, and swagger in, the poorest and leastimportant timing their arrival, when they could, just in advanceof an important man so as to take precedence of him and delayhis entrance.Mindful of my charge to keep Anazeh sober, and more deadly afraidof it than of all the other risks, I hung about waiting for him,hoping he would arrive before Abdul Ali or ben Nazir.  I wantedto go inside and be seated before either of those gentry came.But not a bit of it.  I saw Anazeh ride up at the head of histwenty men, halt at a corner, and ask a question.  His men were inmilitary order, and looked not only ready but anxious to chargethe crowd and establish their old chief's importance.Mahommed ben Hamza, not quite so smelly in his new clothes, wasstanding at my elbow."Sheikh Anazeh beckons you," he said.So the two of us worked our way leisurely through the crowdtoward the side-street down which Anazeh had led his party.  Wefound them looking very spruce and savage, four abreast, drawn upin the throat of an alley, old Anazeh sitting his horse at theirhead like a symbol of the ancient order waiting to assault thenew.  My horse was close beside him, held by Ahmed, actingservitor on foot.The old man let loose the vials of his wrath on me the minute Idrew near, and Mahommed ben Hamza took delicious pleasure intranslating word for word."Is that the way an effendi in my care should be seen at such atime--on foot?  Am I a maskin* that you do not ride?  Is thehorse not good enough?" [*Poor devil]I made ben Hamza explain that I was to attend the mejlis asSheikh Abdul Ali's guest.  But that only increased his wrath."So said ben Nazir!  Shall a lousy Damascene trick me out ofkeeping my oath?  You are in my safekeeping until you tread onBritish soil again, and my honour is concerned in it!  No doubtthat effeminate schemer of schemes would like to display you atthe mejlis as his booty, but you are mine!  Did you think you arenot under obligation to me?"I answered pretty tactfully.  I said that Allah had undoubtedlycreated him to be a protector of helpless wayfarers and the veryguardian of honour.  Mahommed ben Hamza added to the complimentswhile rendering mine into Arabic.  But though Anazeh's wrath wassomewhat mollified, he was not satisfied by any means."Am I a dog," he demanded, "that I should be slighted for thesake of that Damascene?"It looked to me like the proper moment to try out Grim'smagic formula."You are the father of lions.  And a lion knows a lion in thedark!" said I.The effect was instantaneous.  He puffed his cheeks out inastonishment, and sucked them in again.  The overbearing angervanished as he leaned forward in the saddle to scrutinize myface.  It was clear that he thought my use of that phrase mightjust possibly have been an accident."Jimgrim says--""Ah!  What says Jimgrim?  Who are you that know where he is?""A lion knows a lion in the dark!" I said again, that there mightbe no mistake about my having used the words deliberately.He nodded."Praised be Allah!  Blessings upon His Prophet!  Whatsays Jimgrim?""Jimgrim says I am to keep by Anazeh and watch him, lest he drinkstrong drink and lose his honour by becoming like a beast withoutdecency or understanding!""Mount your horse, effendi.  Sit beside me."I complied.  Ben Hamza took the place of Ahmed, who went to therear looking rather pleased to get out of the limelight."What else says Jimgrim?" asked Anazeh."There will be a message presently, providing Sheikh Anazehkeeps sober!"To say that I was enjoying the game by this time is like tryingto paint heaven with a tar-brush.  You've got to be on the insideof an intrigue before you can appreciate the thrill of it.Nobody who has not had the chance to mystify a leader of cheerfulmurderers in a city packed with conspirators, with the shadow ofa vulture on the road in front, and fanged death waiting to belet loose, need talk to me of excitement."Well and good," said Anazeh.  "When Jimgrim speaks, I listen!"Can you beat that?  Have you ever dreamed you were possessed ofsome magic formula like "Open Sesame," and free to work with itany miracle you choose?  Was the dream good?  I was awake--on ahorse--in a real eastern alley--with twenty thieves as picturesqueas Ali Baba's, itching for action behind me!"Abdul Ali of Damascus thinks he will enter the mejlis last andcreate a great sensation," said Anazeh.  "That son of infamiesdeceives himself.  I shall enter last.  I shall bring you.  Therewill be no doubt who is important!"Just as he spoke there clattered down the street at right anglesto us a regular cavalcade of horsemen led by no less than AbdulAli with a sycophant on either hand.  Cardinal Wolsey, or someother wisehead, once remarked that a king is known by thesplendour of his servants.  Abdul Ali's parasites were dressedfor their part in rose-coloured silk and mounted on beautifulwhite Arab horses so severely bitted that they could not helpbut prance.Abdul Ali, on the other hand, played more a king-maker's role,dark and sinister in contrast to their finery, on a dark brownhorse that trotted in a business-like, hurry-up-and-get-it-done-with manner.  He rode in the German military style, and if youcan imagine the Kaiser in Arab military head-dress, with highblack riding boots showing under a brown cloak, you have hisdescription fairly closely.  The upturned moustaches and thescowl increased the suggestion, and I think that was deliberate."A dog--offspring of dogs!  Curse his religion and his bed!"growled Anazeh in my ear.The old sheikh allowed his enemy plenty of time.  To judge by theway the men behind us gathered up their reins and closed in knee-to-knee, they would have liked to spoil Abdul Ali's afternoon byriding through his procession and breaking its formation.  ButAnazeh had his mind set, and they seemed to know better than totry to change it for him.  We waited until noises in the streetdied down, and then Ahmed was sent to report on developments."Abdul Ali has gone into the mejlis and the doors are closed," heannounced five minutes later.  That seemed to suit Anazehperfectly, for his eyes lit up with satisfaction.  Evidentlybeing excluded from the council was his meat and drink.  He gaveno order, but rode forward and his men followed as a snake's tailfollows its head, four abreast, each man holding his rifle asbest suited him;  that gave them a much more warlike appearancethan if they had imitated the western model of exact conformity.We rode down-street toward the castle at a walk, between veryinterested spectators who knew enough to make way without beingtold.  And at the castle gate we were challenged by a man onfoot, who commanded about twice our number of armed guards."The hour is passed," he announced.  "The order is to admit nolate-comers.""Who gives orders to me?" Anazeh retorted."It was agreed by all the notables.""I did not agree.  Wallah!  Thou dog of a devil's dung-heap, sayyou I am not a notable?""Nevertheless--""Open that gate!"They opened it.  Two of the men began to do it even before theirchief gave the reluctant order.  Anazeh started to ride throughwith his men crowding behind.  But that, it seemed, wasaltogether too much liberty to take with the arrangements.Shouting all together, the gate-guards surged in to take hold ofbridles and force Anazeh's dependents back.  Teeth and eyesflashed.  It looked like the makings of a red-hot fight."No retainers allowed within the gate!  Principals only!" roaredthe captain of the guard, in Arabic that sounded like explosionsof boiling oil.Anazeh, Mahommed ben Hamza and I were already within thecourtyard.  Four of Anazeh's followers made their way, throughafter us before any one could prevent them.  At that moment therecame a tremendous clattering of hoofs and the crowd outside thegate scattered this and that way in front of about a hundred ofthe other chiefs' dependents, who had dutifully stayed outsideand had sought shade some little distance off.Whether the sudden disturbance rattled him, or whether hesupposed that all the other truculent ruffians were going to tryto follow our example, at any rate the man on duty lost his headand shouted to his men to shut the gate again.  Before they coulddo it every one of Anazeh's gang had forced his way through.There we all were on forbidden ground, with a great iron-studdedgate slammed and bolted behind us.  To judge by the row outsidethe keepers of the gate had got their hands full.In front of us was a short flight of stone steps, and anothergreat wooden door set in stone posts under a Roman arch.  Therewere only two armed men leaning against it.  They eyed Anazeh andour numbers nervously."Open!"Anazeh could use his voice like a whip-crack.  They fumbled withthe great bolt and obeyed, swinging the door wide.  I thought fora minute that my arrogant old protector meant to ride up thesteps and through the door into the mejlis hall with all his men;but he was not quite so high-handed as that.After a good long look through the door, I suppose to make surethere was no ambush inside waiting for him, he dismounted, andordered his men to occupy a stable-building across the courtyard,from which it would have been impossible to dislodge them withouta siege.  Then, when he had seen the last man disappear into it,he led me and Mahommed ben Hamza up the steps.Ben Hamza was grinning like a schoolboy, beside himself withdelight at the prospect of elbowing among notables, as well asinordinately proud of his new clothes and the smell of importedsoap that hung about him like an aura.  But Anazeh looked like anancient king entering into his own.  Surely there was neveranother man who could stride so majestically and seem soconscious of his own ability to override all law.We passed under the shadowy arch and down a cool stone passage toyet another heavy door that barred our way.  Anazeh thundered onit with his rifle-butt, for there were no attendants there to dohis bidding.  There was no answer.  Only a murmur of voiceswithin.  So he thundered again, and this time the door openedabout six inches.  A face peered through the opening cautiously,and asked what was wanted."What is this?" asked Anazeh.  "Is a mejlis held without mypresence?  Since when?""You are too late!"The face disappeared.  Some one tried to close the door.Anazeh's foot prevented."Open!" he demanded.  The butt of his rifle thundered again onthe wood.There was a babel of voices inside, followed by sudden silence.Anazeh made a sign to Mahommed ben Hamza and me.  We all threelaid our shoulders against the door and shoved hard.  Evidentlythat was not expected;  it swung back so suddenly that we werehard put to it to keep our feet.  The man who had opened the doorlay prone on the floor in front of us with his legs in the air,and Anazeh laughed at him--the bitterest sign of disrespect oneArab can pay to another."Since when does the word of a Damascene exclude an honourablesheikh from a mejlis in El-Kerak?" asked Anazeh, standing inthe doorway.He was in no hurry to enter.  The dramatic old ruffian understoodtoo well the value of the impression he made standing there.  Theroom was crowded with about eighty men, seated on mats andcushions, with a piece of carpeted floor left unoccupied all downthe centre--a high-walled room with beautifully vaulted ceiling,and a mullioned window from which most of the glass was gone.The walls were partly covered with Persian and other mats, butthere was almost no furniture other than water-pipes and littleinlaid tables on which to rest coffee-cups and matches.  The airwas thick with smoke already, and the draft from the brokenwindows wafted it about in streaky clouds.Every face in the room was turned toward Anazeh.  I kept as muchas possible behind him, for you can't look dignified in thatsetting if all you have on is a stained golf suit, that you haveslept in.  It seemed all right to me to let the old sheikh haveall the limelight.But he knew better.  Perhaps my erstwhile host ben Nazir hadunderstood a little German after all.  More likely he had divinedAbdul Ali's purpose to make use of me.  Certainly he had pouredthe proper poison in Anazeh's ear, and the old man understood myvalue to a nicety.He took me by the arm and led me in, Mahommed ben Hamza followinglike a dog that was too busy wagging its tail to walk straight.You would have thought Anazeh and I were father and son bythe way he leaned toward me and found a way for me among thecrowded cushions.He had no meek notions about choosing a low place.  Expecting tobe taken at his own valuation, he chose a high place to beginwith.  There were several unoccupied cushions near the door, andthere were half-a-dozen servants busy in a corner with coffee-pots and cakes.  He prodded one of the servants and ordered himto take two cushions to a place he pointed out, up near thewindow close to Abdul Ali.  There was no room there.  Thatwas the seat of the mighty.  You could not have dropped ahandkerchief between the men who wanted to be nearest the throneof influence.  But Anazeh solved that riddle.  He strode, statelyand magnificent, up the middle of the carpet amid a mutter ofimprecations.  And when one more than ordinarily indignant sheikhdemanded to know what he meant by it, he paused in front of himand laid his right hand on my shoulder.  (There was a loadedrifle in his left.)"Who offers indignity to a distinguished guest?" he demanded.The question was addressed to everybody in the room.  He tookcare they were all aware of it.  His stern eyes traveled fromface to face."My men, who escorted him here, are outside the door.  They canenter and escort him away, if there are none here who understandhow to treat the stranger in our midst!"There was goose-flesh all over me, and I did not even try to lookunembarrassed.  A man's wits, if he has any, work swiftly when helooks like being torn to pieces at a moment's notice.  It seemedto me that the less insolent I appeared, the less likely theywere to vent their wrath on me.  I tried to look as if I didn'tunderstand I was intruding--as if I expected a welcome."Good!" Anazeh whispered in my ear.  "You do well."There was a murmur of remonstrance.  The sheikh who had dared torebuke Anazeh found the resentment turned against himself.Somebody told him sharply to mend his manners.  Anazeh, shrewdold opportunist, promptly directed the servant to place cushionson the edge of the carpet, in front of the first row of thosewho wished to appear important.  That obliged the front rankto force the men behind them backward, closer to the wall, sothat room could be made for us without our trespassing on theforbidden gangway.So I sat down in the front row, five cushions from Abdul Ali.Anazeh squatted beside me with his rifle across his knees.  ThenMahommed ben Hamza forced himself down between me and the man onmy left, using his left elbow pretty generously and making thebest of the edges of two cushions.  As far as I could see therewere not more than half-a-dozen other men in the room who hadrifles with them, although all had daggers, and some wore curvedscimitars with gold-inlaid hilts.As soon as I could summon sufficient nerve to look about me andmeet the brown, conjecturing eyes that did not seem to knowwhether to resent my presence or be simply curious, I caught theeye of Suliman ben Saoud in the front row opposite, ten or twelvecushions nearer the door than where I sat.  He did not seem tonotice me.  The absence of eyebrows made his face expressionless.He didn't even vaguely resemble the Major James Grim whom I knewhim to be.  When his eyes met mine there was no symptom ofrecognition.  If he felt as nervous as I did he certainly did notshow it behind his mask of insolent indifference.There was still a good deal of muttered abuse being directed atAnazeh.  The atmosphere was electric.  It felt as if violencemight break out any minute.  Abdul Ali seemed more nervous thanany one else;  he rocked himself gently on his cushion, as ifchurning the milk of desire into the butter of wise words.Suddenly he turned to the sheikh on his left, a handsome man ofmiddle age, who wore a scimitar tucked into a gold-embroideredsash, and whispered to him.Ben Hamza whispered to me:  "That sheikh to whom Abdul Ali speaksis Ali Shah al Khassib, the most powerful sheikh in these parts.A great prince.  A man with many followers."Ali Shah al Khassib called for prayer to bring the mejlis toorder.  He was immensely dignified.  The few words he pronouncedabout asking God to bless the assembled notables with wisdom, inorder that they might reach a right decision, would have beenperfectly in place in the Capitol at Washington, or anywhere elsewhere men foregather to decide on peace or war.At once a muballir* on his left opened a copy of the Koran on acushion on his lap and began to read from it in a nasal singsong.There were various degrees of devoutness, and even of inattentionshown by those who listened.  Some knelt and prostratedthemselves.  Others, including Anazeh, sat bolt upright, closingtheir eyes dreamily at intervals.  Over the way, Jim Suliman benSaoud Grim was especially formally devout.  His very lifeundoubtedly depended on being recognized as a fanatic offanatics. [*A Moslem priest who recites prayers.]But there were three Christian sheikhs in the room.  One of themopposite me pulled out a Bible and laid it on the carpet as asort of challenge to the Koran.  It was probably a dangerousthing to do, although most Moslems respect the Bible as a verysacred book.  The manner in which it was done suggesteddeliberate effort to provoke a quarrel.Mahommed ben Hamza, dividing his time like a schoolboy in chapelbetween staring about him and attending by fits and starts,nudged me in the ribs and whispered:"See that Christian!  He would not dare do that, only on thisoccasion they like to think that Moslems and Christians areagreeing together."The man who was reading to himself from the Bible looked up andcaught my eye.  He tapped the book with his finger and nodded, asmuch as to ask why I did not join him.  At once I pulled my ownfrom my pocket.  He smiled acknowledgment as I opened it atrandom.  Certainly he thought I did it to support his tactlesslyill-timed assertion of his own religion.  Very likely my action,since I was a guest and therefore not to be insulted, savedhim from violence.  Incipient snarls of fanatical indignationdied away.But as a matter of fact my eye was on Jim Suliman ben Saoud Grim.As the reading from the Koran came to an end amid a murmur ofresponses from all the sheikhs, the crooked-faced Ichwan satupright.  In his sullen, indifferent way, he stared leisurelyalong the line until his eyes rested on me.As his eyes met mine I marked the place where the Bible was openwith a pencil, and closed the book, suspecting that he might beglad to know where a pencil could be found in a contingency.He did not smile.  The expression of his face barely changed.Just for a second I thought I saw a flicker of amused approvalpass over the corners of his eyes and mouth.So I left the book lying where it was with the pencil foldedin it.Chapter Eight"He will say next that it was he who set the stars in the skyover El-Kerak, and makes the moon rise!"Ali Shah al Khassib was the first to speak.  He was heard to theend respectfully, none interrupting.  But it seemed obvious fromtheir faces that not a few sheikhs were disposed to question bothhis leadership and most of what he said.  Mahommed ben Hamza keptup a running whisper of interpretation, breathing into my earuntil it was wet with condensed breath.  I had to use ahandkerchief repeatedly.Ali Shah al Khassib made no definite proposal.  He said that aman whom they all knew well had brought news to the effect thatEmir Feisul was ready to make war on the French in order to drivethem out of Syria.  That in a case like that, of Moslems againstkafirs,* there could be no question on which side their hearts ortheir interests lay.  That several dependable men had broughtword of great unrest in Palestine.  That in all likelihood theBritish would send their army to help the French, in which casethe Arabs of Palestine were likely to rise in rebellion in theBritish army's rear.  That was the situation.  They were invitedto consider it, and to decide what action, if any, seemed calledfor. [*Unbelievers.]He sat down without having risked his leadership by any statementof his own attitude.  He had simply reported facts that hebelieved to be true--facts that many of the notables plainly didnot yet believe, or believed only in part.  There followed aperfect babel of argument, during which the servants passed thecoffee and cakes around.  After that, during every intervalbetween speeches there was more coffee and more cakes--wonderfulcakes made with honey and almonds, immensely filling;  but themore full an Arab gets of stodgy food the more his tongue wags,until at last he talks himself to sleep.For ten minutes men were shouting their opinions to one anotherto and fro across the room.  From what I could make of it therewas not a man who did not advocate putting the whole of Palestineto the sword forthwith.  But it was noticeable that when theirturns came to stand up and address the mejlis their advocacy wasconsiderably toned down.  Everybody seemed to want somebody elseto father the proposal for a raid, although every man pretendedto be anxious to take part in one.Old Anazeh on my right sat in grim silence, quizzing each talkerin turn with puckered eyes.  The only comment he made was a sortof internal rumbling, suggestive of the preliminary notice ofan earthquake.At the end of ten minutes Sheikh Ali Shah al Khassib broughtproceedings a step forward by calling for confirmation of thenews of unrest in Palestine.  Man after man got up, and, since hewas speaking of others, not of himself, painted the discontent ofthe Palestinians in lurid terms.  Each man tried to outvie theother.  The first man said they were anxious regarding theZionists and keen for a solution of the problem.  The second saidthey hated the Zionists, and could see no way out of theirpredicament but by rebellion.  The third said that no Arab inPalestine could eat for thinking of the Zionist outrage, and thatthe heart of every man in El-Kerak should bleed for hisdistressed brethren.To judge by what the fourth and fifth and sixth said, Palestinewas in a state of scarcely suppressed rebellion, and every livingArab in the country was sharpening his sword in secret for thebutchering of Zionists at the first opportunity.  The seventh mansaid that the Palestine Arabs had never under Turkish rulesuffered and groaned as they did under the British, and thattheir cry was going up to heaven for relief from the ignominioustyranny of Zionist pretensions.Ali Shah al Khassib chose that ringing appeal as the cue for hisnext move in the game.  He called on Sheikh Abdul Ali, "as wellknown in Damascus as in this place," to address the mejlis.There was instant silence.  Even the coffee cups ceased rattling.Abdul Ali got to his feet with the manner of a man long used toswaying assemblies.  He had just the right air of authority;exactly the right suggestion of deference;  the quiet smile ofthe man with secrets up his sleeve;  and he paused just longenough before speaking to whet curiosity and fix attention.He did not speak floridly or fast, and he indulged in none ofthose flights of oratory that most Arabs love.  There was ampletime between his sentences for Mahommed ben Hamza to translateinto my wet and itching ear.  But every sentence of his speechhad measured weight in it, and every word he used was chosen forits poison or its sting.He began by reminding them of the war and of Emir Feisul's sharein it.  Of how they, and their fathers, and their sons had foughtbehind Feisul and helped to establish him in Damascus.  Then hespoke of the British promise that the Arabs' should have akingdom of their own, with Damascus for its capital and bordersto include all the peoples of Arab blood in the Near East.  Hepaused for a full minute after that.  Then:"But the French are in Syria.  The French, who also promised usan Arab kingdom.  They have assembled at the coast an army thatalready threatens Emir Feisul.  The British are in Palestine,where they are admitting a horde of Zionist Jews to displace usArabs, rightful owners of the soil.  The British are also inMesopotamia, which they have seized for themselves for the sakeof the oil which Allah, in His wisdom, created beneath thefertile earth.  Feisul makes ready to defend Syria against theFrench.  But the British will march to the aid of the French.Can anybody tell me how much of that promise to us Arabs has beenkept, by either nation, French or British?"So far he was on thoroughly safe ground.  A man who preachedagainst the French could hardly be suspected of being hired bythe French to do it.  There was nobody there but he who could saywhat Feisul's intentions actually were.  You can say what youlike against the British anywhere, at any time, and find some oneto believe what you say.  And it needed no wizardry to prove thatthe Allies had broken every promise they ever made to the Arabs."Are you going to sit idle, and let Emir Feisul and the Syriansfight the French alone?" he asked, and paused again.There was a great deal of murmuring--not quite all of it, Ithought, entirely in his favour."What is the alternative to sitting still like camels waiting tobe doubly burdened?  If you raid Palestine, the local Arabs willall rise to your assistance.  The throat of every Zionist fromthe Lebanon to Beersheba will be cut.  There will be plunderbeyond reckoning.  And you will help Feisul by holding back theBritish army from marching to the assistance of the French.  Thequestion is, are you men?--are you Arabs?--are you true Moslems?--or do you like to look down from these heights of El-Kerak overthe home of your ancestors in the hands of so-called Zionists whoare nothing but Jews, under a new name?"He sat down before any one could answer him, and whispered to AliShah al Khassib, who called on another man to speak at once.  Itwas a pretty obvious piece of concerted strategy, but he got bywith it for the moment.  The general feeling seemed to be infavour of a raid if only some one would start it.  Nobody seemedto mind much how the decision was arrived at, so long as theresponsibility was passed to some one else.The man now called on was a smooth-tongued, tall, lean individualwith shifty eyes, and a flow of talk of the coffeeshop variety.At the end of his first sentence any fool would have known thathe had been put up to quiz Abdul Ali, in order that Abdul Alimight have an excuse to justify himself.  He attacked him verymildly, with much careful hedging and apologetic gesture, on theground that possibly the Damascene was ignoring their interestswhile urging them to take action that would suit his own.Even with that mild criticism he set loose quite a murmur ofminority agreement.  For the first time since the speech-makingbegan Anazeh barked approval.  I thought for a moment the old manwas going to get to his feet.  But Abdul Ali was up again first,and launched on the seas of self-esteem.If I had not listened to equally childish political maneuvers inthe States, and seen them succeed for the reason that people whowant something want also to be fooled into getting it by specialarguments, it would have seemed incredible that a man, who hadrecently boasted of statesmanship, should dare to make such apublic ass of himself.  Yet, for fifteen minutes he carried thewhole meeting with him, and the warmth of his self-satisfiedemotion made him ooze resplendent sweat."Now he speaks of you, effendi," Mahommed ben Hamza whispered;and in confirmation of it Anazeh clutched my arm, as if to keepthe tide of eloquence from washing me away.Had the British done anything for the country this side ofJordan?  Anything for the people's education, for instance?  No!Instead, they had taken away the missionaries.  Better thannothing were those missionaries.  They had their faults.  Theyundermined religion.  But they taught.  And the British hadcalled them in, giving some ridiculous excuse about danger.  Ithad remained then for him--Abdul Ali of Damascus and of El-Kerak--the same individual who was now urging them to strike for theirown advantage--to take the first step for the establishment inEl-Kerak of a school that should be independent of the British.He, Abdul Ali, greatly daring because he had the interest of El-Kerak at heart, had introduced that day into the mejlis adistinguished guest from the United States, whose sole desire--whose only object in life--whose altruistic and divine ambitionwas to establish an American secular school in El-Kerak!He sat down, glowing with super-virtue.  And then the fur flew.Anazeh was first on his feet."Princes!" he shouted.  "That Damascene is a father of lies!  Itwas I, Anazeh, who brought this man hither!  That corrupter ofhonesty, who doles out other people's gold for bidden purposes,seeks to appear as your benefactor!"  (It was fairly obvious thatAnazeh had not received any of the gold.)  "He will say next thatit was he who set the stars in the sky over El-Kerak, and makesthe moon rise!  He is a foreigner, a father of snakes, and aborn liar!"Anazeh refused to sit down again, but stood with rifle on hisarm, daring any one to challenge his statements.  Abdul Aliflushed angrily, but laughed aloud.  The next man on his feet wasben Nazir, my erstwhile host, who had repudiated me.  And herepudiated me all over again, accusing me of abusing hishospitality by going over to Abdul Ali, who had never even heardof me before I came to El-Kerak.There was no making head or tail of the storm of abuse andcounter-abuse that followed, except that it did not look healthyfor me.  There seemed to be four or five different factions, allof whom regarded me as the bone of contention.  Rather thanbetray anxiety I opened the Bible and began to make dots underletters, spelling out a message to Grim to the effect that I hadno notion where to find lodgings for the night, and that ifAnazeh elected to carry me off I should have to go with him.I did not know how to get the message to him without arousingsuspicion and making matters worse than they were, and it seemedbest not to call attention to the fact that I was writing.  So Imade a few dots at a time, and looked about me.  I saw Abdul Ali,laughing cynically, make a gesture with his arm as if heconsigned me to the dogs.  Then I caught Grim's eye--Suliman benSaoud's.  He, too, was making capital of my predicament.He had got the attention of the men around him, and was pointingat the Bible while he reeled off a string of an angry rhetoricthat sounded like a cat-fight.  He shouted at me, and made angrygestures;  but I knew that if he wanted me to understand hissignals he would never make them openly, so I ignored them."The sheikh from Arabia demands to see the book," said Mahommedben Hamza in my ear.I passed it over the carpet with the pencil folded in it at thepage I had begun to mark;  and the men opposite handed it along,with remarks they considered appropriate.  Jim Suliman ben SaoudGrim seized the book angrily, glared at it, denounced it, andwrote something on the fly-leaf.  He showed it to the men besidehim, and they laughed, nodding approval.  He wrote again.  Theyapproved again.  He turned and talked to them.  Then, as if hehad an afterthought, he wrote a third time.  When they wanted tolook at that he ran the pencil through it and wrote somethingelse on the other side of the fly-leaf, at which they alllaughed uproariously.  Presently he tossed the book back to mewith all the outward signs of contempt that a fanatic can showfor another religion.I have kept that Bible as a souvenir, with the verses from theKoran written on the flyleaf in Arabic in Grim's fine hand.Underneath them, in Greek characters with a pencil line scrawledthrough them, is the only sentence that interested me at themoment:"This looks good.  Keep Anazeh quiet and sober."Anazeh was beginning to hold forth again, shaking his fistat Abdul Ali and making the roof echo to his mighty bellowing.I tugged at the skirt of his cloak, and after a minute hesat down to discover what I wanted.  He seemed to think Ineeded reassurance.  He began to flood me with promises ofprotection.  It was about a minute before I could get a wordin edgeways.  Then:"Jimgrim says," said I."Jimgrim!  Is he here?""He surely is.""How do you know?""We have a sign. Jimgrim says, 'Be quiet, and drink nostrong drink.'"He leaned across to Mahommed ben Hamza, doubting his ears and myArabic.  I repeated the message, and ben Hamza translated."I don't believe Jimgrim is here!" said Anazeh.  "I would knowhim among a million.""It is true," said ben Hamza, grinning from ear to ear, "for Imyself know where he sits!""Where then?" Anazeh demanded excitedly."Don't you dare!" said I, and ben Hamza grinned again."He is my friend.  I say nothing," he answered.Anazeh put in the next five minutes minutely examining every facewithin range, while the din of argument rose louder and moreviolent than ever, and suspicion of me seemed to be gaining.But suddenly Suliman ben Saoud got to his feet and there wassilence.  They were all willing to listen to a member of theIchwan sect, for the news of its power and political designs hadspread wherever men talk Arabic.  He spoke gutturally in adialect that ben Hamza did not find it any too easy to follow, soI only got the general gist of Grim's remarks.He said that he had much experience of raids and of makingpreparations for them.  A raid aimed at the Zionists--at thismoment--might be good--perhaps.  They were better judges of thatthan he.  But it was all-important to know who was in favour ofthe raid, and exactly why.  The words men spoke were not nearlyso impressive as the deeds they did.  Therefore, when theillustrious Sheikh Abdul Ali of Damascus urged a raid on the onehand, and boasted of provision for a school in El-Kerak on theother, it would be well to examine this foreign effendi,   whomAbdul Ali claimed to have introduced.  The claim was disputed,but the claim was not made for nothing.  In his judgment, basedon vast experience of politics in Arabia, motives were seldom onthe surface.  All depended on the motives of the illustriousAbdul Ali.  This stranger from America--he glared balefully atme--should be investigated thoroughly.  As a man of vastexperience with the interests of El-Islam at heart, he offeredrespectfully to examine this stranger thoroughly with the aid ofan interpreter.  He confessed to certain suspicions;  should theyprove unfounded, then it might be reasonable to credit the restof Abdul Ali's statements;  if not, no.  He was willing, if thehonourable mejlis saw fit, to take the stranger aside and putmany questions to him.When he had finished you could actually physically feel thesuspicion directed at me.  It was like a cold wind.  Anazeh wasjust as conscious of it, and muttered something about its beingtime to go.  Abdul Ali got up and asked indignantly why theIchwan from so far away should have such an important voice;  hehimself stood there ready to answer all questions.  Suliman benSaoud retorted sourly that he proposed to question the Damascenein public after privately interrogating me."They shall not interfere with you!  You are in my charge,"Anazeh growled in my ear.  "I will summon my men at thefirst excuse.""Jimgrim says, 'Be quiet!'" I answered.There was another uproar.  Ali Shah al Khassib openly took thepart of Abdul Ali.  A dozen men demanded to know how much he hadbeen paid to do it.  Finally, Suliman ben Saoud beckoned me.  Igot up, and with Mahommed ben Hamza at my heels I followed him toa narrow door in a side wall that opened on a stone stairwayleading to the ramparts.  Anazeh' came too, growling like ahungry bear, and after a couple of blood-curdling threats hurledat Suliman ben Saoud's back he took up position in the open door,facing the crowd, and dared any one to try to follow.  He seemedto have confidence in Mahommed ben Hamza's ability to protect me,if necessary, on the roof.The roof and ramparts appeared deserted.  They were in theruinous state to which the Turks reduce everything by sheerneglect, and in which Arabs, blaming the Turks, seemed quitedisposed to leave things.  The Ichwan led the way to thesouthwest corner, peering about him to make sure no guards werein hiding, or asleep behind projecting buttresses.  Overhead thekites were wheeling against a pure blue sky.  The Dead Sea layand smiled below us, with the gorgeous, treeless Judean Hillsbeyond.  Through the broken window of the hall came the clamourof arguing men."O, Jimgrim!" grinned Mahommed ben Hamza when we reachedthe corner.Grim turned and faced us with folded arms, leaning his backagainst the parapet.Ben Hamza continued:  "You are a very prince of dare-devils!  Oneword from me--one little word, and they would fling you down intothe moat for the vultures to feed on!""I remember a time," Grim answered, "when a word from me savedyou from hanging.""True, father of good fortune!  But a man must laugh.  Iwill hold my tongue in El-Kerak like a tomb that has notbeen plundered!""You'd better!  You've work to do.  Where are your men?""All where I can find them.""Good.  You'll get turned out of the mejlis presently.  Look downinto the moat now."We all peered over.  The lower ramp of the wall sloped steeply,but all the way up the sharp southwest corner the stones werebroken out, and a goat, or a very active man could find foothold."Could you climb that?""Surely.  Remember, Jimgrim, when I climbed the wall of El-Kudz(Jerusalem) to escape from the police!""Bring your men into the moat between dark and moonrise.  Have along rope with you--a good one.  You and two men climb up hereand hide.  The remainder wait below.  Oh, yes;  and bring a wheatsack--a new, strong one.  You may have to wait for several hours.When you see me, take your cue from me;  but whatever happens, nomurder!  You understand?  Nobody's to be killed."Ben Hamza grinned and nodded.  He seemed to be one of those good-natured rogues who ask nothing better than the sheer sport oflawless hero-worship.  He would have made a perfect chief ofstaff for any brigand, provided the brigand took lots of chances."You'll be killed, if anybody finds you up here after dark!  Yourealize that?""Trust me."Grim nodded.  He was good at trusting people, when he had to, andwhen the selection was his own."Affairs seem to be drifting nicely," he said, turning to me."It's best not to let Anazeh know who I am just yet, if that canbe helped.  But if you must, when the time comes, you'll have totell him.  Do keep him sober.  After the evening prayer there'llbe a banquet;  if he gets drunk we're done for.  I'm going tomake you out an awful leper, if you don't mind.  They may yellfor your hide and feathers before I've finished, but Anazeh willprotect you.  If he leaves the hall in a huff, don't make anybones about going with him.  Let him ride out of town and waitfor me about two miles down the track, at the point where thattomb stands above a narrow pass between two big rocks.  Do youremember it?""What if he won't wait?""He must!  Tell him I'll have a prisoner with me;  then he'll becurious.  But you can bet on old Anazeh when he's sober.  Butthings may turn out so that it's simpler for you to stay and seethis through with me.  In that case you must persuade him to gowithout you, after explaining to him just where he's to wait.""How shall I do that?" I said. "I haven't enough Arabic.""I'll write it," he answered.  "Give me that pencil.""Say something, too, then about his keeping sober."Grim nodded, and wrote quite a long letter in Arabic on a page ofmy notebook."The next move," he said, as I pocketed the letter, "is for me toget Abdul Ali's goat:  I think--and I hope--he'll try to bribeme.  If he does, he's my meat!  The whole question of raid or noraid hangs on their confidence in him.  If I throw suspicion onhim, and he disappears directly afterwards, they'll abandon theplan, confiscate his goods and chattels, and quarrel amongthemselves instead of raiding Palestine.  Get me?""Um-n-yes.  I've sat on a horse I was warned against--feltsafer--and gone to hospital at that."He laughed."No hospitals up here!  It'll be soon over if they get wise tous.  But I think we're all right;  and you're almost certainlysafe.  But don't be tempted to talk.  Well--we've been up herelong enough for me to have put you through the third degree.Better look a bit uncomfortable as you go down, as if I'd gotunder your skin with some awkward questions.  You, too, benHamza;  don't grin;  look afraid.""I am not at all afraid, Jimgrim.  But I will try."Grim studied for a moment."Don't forget," he added, "at the first suggestion that you'renot wanted, make yourself scarce, and go and round up your men.If you're thrown out pretty roughly, keep your temper and run.""Taht il-amr!" (Yours to command.)"Come on, then.  Let's go."The sun was fairly low over the Judean Hills as we turned downthe narrow stairs and found Anazeh waiting at the bottom.Chapter Nine"Feet downwards, too afraid to yell!"--Abdul Ali of Damascus was holding the floor again when wereturned.  He had abandoned the cold air of mysterious authorityand secrets in reserve.  His claim to backstairs influence havingbeen challenged, he had resorted to the emotional appeal that isthe simplest means of controlling any crowd of men anywhere.  Thedemagog who can find a million men all responsive to the sameemotion can swing them as easily as a hundred if he knows hisbusiness.  Loot was the tune he harped, with the old Ishmaelblood-lust by way of obbligato.He had them by the heart-strings, and there were long-neckedbottles of liquor that smelt of aniseed being passed from hand tohand.  We returned to our places almost unnoticed, and within theminute some one handed a full bottle to Anazeh;  the accompanyingcup was big enough to hold any ordinary drunkard's breakfast, andthe old sheikh's eyes admired the size of it.I laid my hand on the wrist that held the bottle.  He shook itoff angrily, and began to pour.  Grim, over the way, lookedanxious.  It was up to me to play this hand, so I led my aceof trumps.Suddenly, and very clumsily, I rocked sideways to reach my hip-pocket, contriving to jog his elbow and spill what was already inthe cup.  He turned his head to curse savagely, and I showed himthe folded sheet from my notebook.  His name was on it in Arabic:"Sheikh Anazeh ben Mahmoud, from Jimgrim."He seized it, setting the bottle down between his feet, where itwas instantly reached for by some one else and handed down theline.  Reading was evidently not Anazeh's favorite amusement, buthe knitted his brows over the letter and wrestled with it word byword, while Abdul Ali's fiery declamation made the vaulted roofresound.  I could only make out snatches of the appeal tosavagery--a word and a sentence here and there."Who are you, princes?  Men with swords, or slaves who mustobey?--Raid over the Jordan twenty thousand strong!--What areJews?  Shall Jews take the home of your ancestors?  Who says so?--Let the Jews be buried in the land they come to steal!--You saythe Jews are cleverer than you.  Cut their heads off, then theycannot think!""When did Jimgrim give you this?" Anazeh demanded, folding theletter and stowing it in his bosom."That is the message that I told you would come later ifyou waited.""Do you know what is in the message?""No."  That was perfectly true.  I had talked with Grim, but hadnot read what he had written."He wishes me to go and wait for him in a certain place""Why not do it?""Rubbama." (Perhaps.)"True-believers!  Followers of the Prophet!  Sons of warriorkings!" thundered Abdul Ali.  "Will you do nothing to helpFeisul, a lineal descendant of the Prophet?  You have helped himto a throne.  Now strike to hold him there!""Jimgrim says, I may go away and leave you here," growled Anazeh."What say you?""Ala khatrak. (Please yourself.)  Jimgrim is wise.""He is the father of wisdom.  Mashallah!  I will consider it.There will be a banquet presently!""And loot!  You can help yourselves!" shouted Abdul Ali ofDamascus.  Then he sat down amid a storm of applause.  Sulimanben Saoud--Jimgrim--was on his feet before the tumult died away,and again they grew perfectly still to listen to him.  If anArab loves anything under heaven more than his own style offighting, it is the action and reaction of debate.  I couldnot understand a word of the mid-Arabian dialect, but AbdulAli's retorts were plain enough;  and from the way that Grimpointed at me and Mahommed ben Hamza it was fairly easy tofollow what was happening.He denounced me as possibly dangerous, and wondered why theypermitted me to have an interpreter, who could whisper to meeverything that was being said."Put out the interpreter!" sneered Abdul Ali, and there was achorus of approval.   Mahommed ben Hamza got up and hurried forthe door while the hurrying was good and painless to himself,though it was hardly that to other people;  forcing his waybetween the close-packed notables he kicked more than one of thempretty badly and grinned when they cursed him.  I saw Abdul Aliof Damascus whisper to one of his rose-coloured parasites, whogot up at once and made his way toward the door, too."The fellow is from Hebron," Abdul Ali sneered in a voice loudenough for all to hear.  "It is best that he should not go backto Hebron to tell tales!  I have attended to it."My blood ran cold.  I tried to catch Grim's eye, but he would notlook in my direction.  I wondered whether he had heard AbdulAli's threat.  It seemed to me that if Mahommed ben Hamza wereeither murdered or imprisoned Grim's whole chance of success wasgone.  The danger would be multiplied tenfold.  Anazeh seemed theonly remaining hope.  The old-rose individual who followed benHamza had not reached the door yet."How about your men?" I asked."They are all right." Anazeh's eyes pursued the liquor bottle."Why not go and see?" I suggested."Ilhamdul'illah, they are good men.  I know them.  If there istrouble they will come and tell me."The door opened softly.  The gorgeous old-rose parasite slippedthrough.  I had a mental vision of Mahommed ben Hamza lying face-downward with his new coat stained with blood.  There was nothingfor it, it seemed, but the magic formula to move Anazeh."Jimgrim says, 'See that ben Hamza gets safely away!"'"Dog of a Hebron tanner's son--let him die!  What is that to me?""It is Jimgrim's command.""Wallahi haida fasl! (By God, this is a strange affair!)  Waithere!"Old Anazeh, with the name of the Prophet of God on his lips, castan envious glare at the bottle of liquor and seized action by theforelock.  There was nothing to excite comment in his getting upto leave the room.  A dozen men had done that and come in again.He strode out, straight down the middle of the carpet.  Sulimanben Saoud--Jimgrim--went on talking, and to judge by Abdul Ali ofDamascus' increasingly restless retorts he was getting thatgentleman's goat as promised.  Finally Abdul Ali got to his feetand said that if the Ichwan would see him alone he would show himcertain documents that would satisfy him, but that it would notbe policy to produce them in public.  He offered to send for thedocuments, and to show them during or after the banquet.So Jimgrim sat down, and there was a good deal of quiet nudgingand nodding.  Every one seemed to understand that the Ichwan wasgoing to be bribed;  they seemed to admire his ability to get forhimself a share of the funds that most of them had tapped.A man nearly opposite me leaned over and said in fairly goodFrench, with the manner of a doctor assuring his patient that theworst is yet to come:"It has been decided that you are to be detained here in the castleuntil there is no danger of your carrying away important news."While I was turning that over in my mind Anazeh came back,grinning.  Something outside had tickled him immensely, but hewould not say anything.  He sat down beside me and chuckled intohis beard;  and when his neighbour on the right asked what hadamused him he turned the question into a bawdy joke."Did ben Hamza get away?" I whispered.He only nodded.  He continued chuckling until the man on duty bythe door announced to the "assembled lords and princes" that themuezzin summoned them to prayer.  All except three Christiansheikhs trooped up the narrow stairway in Ali Shah al Khassib'swake, Anazeh going last with a half-serious joke about not caringto be stabbed in the back.I expected the three non-Moslems would take advantage of theopportunity to ask me a string of questions.  But they tookexactly the opposite view of the situation.  They avoided me,withdrawing into a corner by themselves.  I suppose theythought that to be seen talking to me was more risky than theamusement merited.So I went up to the ramparts, too, to watch the folk at prayer,minded to keep out of sight, for they don't like being regardedas a curious spectacle;  and on the way up I did something thatmay have had a lot to do with our getting away alive, although Idid not give much thought to it and could hardly have explainedmy motive at the time.The door at the foot of the stairs opened inward.  It was almostexactly the same width as the stairway, so that when it stoodwide open you could not have put your hand between its edge andthe stairway wall.  Lying on the floor of the hall within a fewfeet of the nearest corner was a length of good sound olive-wood,about three inches in thickness, roughly squared and notparticularly squared.  Having stepped on it accidentally, Ipicked it up, and discovered more by accident than intention thatit was longer than the width of the stairway.  Then I noticed anotch in the stairway wall.  Behind the opened door there was adeeper notch in the opposite wall.  There was no lock on thedoor, no bolt.  That length of wood had been cut to fithorizontally from notch to notch across the passage.  Once thatbeam was fitted in its place, whoever wished to reach the roofwould have to burn or batter down the door.  I moved the door andplaced the length of olive-wood on end behind it.I found the view from the ramparts much more interesting than thesoul-saving formalities of eighty or so potential cut-throats.While they prayed I stood watching the shadows deepen in theJordan Valley, as no doubt Joshua once watched them fromsomewhere near that same spot before he marshalled his invadinghost.  You could understand why people who had wandered fortyyears in a stark and howling wilderness should yearn for thosecoloured, fertile acres between the Jordan and the sea:  why theyshould be willing to fight for them, die for them, do anythingrather than turn back.By the time we had filed down--Anazeh last again--the servantshad nearly finished spreading a banquet.  What looked like bed-sheets had been laid along the strip of carpet, and, the wholelength of them was piled with all imaginable things to eat, fromcakes and fruit to whole sheep roasted and seethed in camel'smilk and honey.  There were no less than six sheep placed atintervals along the "table," with mountains of rice, scow-loadsof apricots cooked in various ways, and a good sized flock ofchickens spitted and smeared with peppery sauce.  At a guess, Ishould say there were several pounds of meat, about two chickens,and a peck of rice per man, with apricots and raisins added;  butthey faced the prospect like heroes.Perhaps what helped them face it was the sight of sundry bottlesbearing labels more familiar in the West.  Abdul Ali of Damascus,licking his lips like a cat that smells canary, took his place ona cushion up near the window again on the right of Ali Shah alKhassib, who was only the nominal host.  Abdul Ali left no doubtin anybody's mind as to who was paying for the feast.  It was hewho gave orders to the servants in a bullying tone of voice;  hewho begged every one be seated.Anazeh looked at the bottles of brandy--looked at me--and prayedunder his breath;  or, at any rate, it looked and sounded like aprayer.  He may have been swearing.  He and I were not very farfrom the door;  the seats near the head of the table had all beentaken.  I sat down at once, so as not to be conspicuous, butAnazeh remained standing so long that at last Abdul Ali called tohim to sit down and eat his fill, using the offensivelymagnanimous tone of voice that some men can achieve without aneffort.  I think Anazeh had been waiting for just that opening."I have twenty men outside," he announced.  "Shall I eat, andnot they?""This is a feast for notables," said Abdul Ali."A little bread with my own men is better than meat and drink ata traitor's table," Anazeh answered. "Wallahi! (By God!)  I go toeat with honest men!"  He laid a hand on my head.  "Ye have saidthis effendi must stay in the castle.  Well and good.  Whoeverharms him or offers him indignity shall answer to me and my menfor it!"  He bowed to me like a king taking leave of his court."Lailtak sa'idi.  Allah yifazak, effendi!" (Good night. God keepyou, effendi!)  With that he stalked out, and the door slammedshut behind him.  Everybody, including Abdul Ali, laughed.The banquet was a boresome business--an interminable competitionto see who could eat and drink the most.  With my interpretergone, and everybody else too busy guzzling to trouble to speakdistinctly for my benefit, I had to depend on my ayes forinformation and naturally used them to the utmost.  I noticedthat Abdul All of Damascus, Jimgrim Suliman ben Saoud and myselfwere the only men in the room, servants included, who ate anddrank within the bounds of decency and reason.  One of theservants, walking up and down the table-cloth with brandy andrelays of vegetables, was drunk very early in the game and had tobe thrown out.Abdul Ali kept conversation going on the subject of the raid.The more the brandy bottles circulated the easier he found it tokeep enthusiasm burning.  He talked about me, too, several times,and every time that subject cropped up all eyes turned in mydirection.  I think he was making the most of the school idea,mixing up the raid with education and serving the mixture hot, asit were, with brandy sauce.But over the way, about half-way down the table, the IchwanSuliman ben Saoud, dead-cold-sober and abstemious, as befitted afanatic, was talking, too.  He was quite evidently talkingagainst Abdul Ali, so that the Damascene kept looking at him witha troubled expression.  He glanced frequently at the door, too,as if he expected some one who could put an end to Suliman benSaoud's intrigue.But it was a long time before the door opened and the second ofhis old-rose parasites came in.  I had not noticed until thenthat the man was missing.  He thrust a packet of some sort intoAbdul Ali's hands.  He whispered.  The Damascene's face darkenedinstantly, and he swore like a pirate.  Then, I suppose becausehe had to vent his wrath on somebody, he shouted to me in Germanall down the length of the table:"Your cursed interpreter has nearly killed my secretary!  Hestruck him in the mouth and knocked all his teeth out.  Whatcourteous servants you employ!""What was your secretary trying to do to him?" I retorted, but hesaw fit not to answer that.  He poured some more brandy insteadfor Ali Shah al Khassib.So that was what Anazeh had been laughing at!  The old humouristhad either seen the fracas, or had come on the injured old-rosemessenger of death nursing a damaged face.  I began to shareGrim's good opinion of ben Hamza.  But though I watched Grim'sface, and knew that he knew German, I could not detect a trace ofinterest.  He kept on talking against Abdul Ali until after teno'clock.  By that time most of the notables were about as full asthey could hold.  Those who were not too drunk appeared ready foranything in or out of reason.At that stage of the proceedings they ushered in the dancinggirls.  The servants cleared away most of the food, removed thetable-cloths, and a ring was formed practically all around theroom, the notables leaning their backs against the wall to easeoverworked bellies.  I set my cushion down next to a very drunkenman just by the narrow door that opened on the stairway leadingto the ramparts.  He fell asleep with his head on my shoulderwithin five minutes, and as that, for some subtle reason, seemedto make me even more unnoticeable I let him snore away in peace.Over in Abdul Ali's corner of the room there was a real councilof war going on in whispers.  Opposite to him, ten paces or sodistant from me, Jimgrim Suliman ben Saoud was holding a rivalshow.  It seemed about an even bet which was making greaterheadway.  Those who were more or less drunk, and all the youngersheikhs had eyes and ears for nothing but the dancing girls.They were outrageous hussies.  They wore more clothes than aBroadway chorus lady, and rather less paint, but if they weresymbols of the Moslem paradise (as a learned Arab once assured methat they are meant to be) then, as I answered the Arab on thatoccasion, "me for hell."  But none of those sheikhs had ever seenBroadway, so you could hardly blame them.Abdul Ali of Damascus seemed to have his arrangements with themen in his corner cinched at last to his satisfaction.  He walkeda little unsteadily across the room, apparently to make his peacewith Suliman ben Saoud.  He held brazenly in one hand a leatherwallet that bulged with paper money--doubtless the "documents"that he had sent for.  He nodded to me as he passed withmore familiarity than he had any right to, since he had soostentatiously dismissed me to the dogs.  I suppose he felt sosure of "convincing" Suliman ben Saoud, and was so bent onoffsetting the reaction caused by Anazeh's behavior that he hadbeen reviving that project about the school and therefore choseto appear on intimate terms with me.  I met him more thanhalf-way;  any one who cared to might believe I loved him likea brother.He stood in front of Suliman ben Saoud, rocking just a triflefrom the effects of alcohol and smoke,  and there was about fiveminutes' conversation of which, although I missed a lot of it, Icaught the general drift.  The men who had come under theIchwan's influence kept joining in and raising objections.  Igathered that they expected a proportionate percentage of thebribe for which Suliman ben Saoud was supposed to be maneuvering.But even Abdul Ali, with a pouch of paper money in his hand, wasnot quite so barefaced as to bribe the Ichwan publicly.  At theend of five minutes he suggested a private talk on the parapet.Suliman ben Saoud rose with apparent reluctance.  Abdul Ali ofDamascus took his arm.  It was Suliman ben Saoud who opened thenarrow door, and Abdul Ali who went through first.  I did notwait for any invitation, but let my snoring neighbor fall on hisside, hurried through after them, and closed the door behind me.Groping for the stick in the dark, I jammed it into the notches.It fitted perfectly.  It held the door immovable and barredthat stairway against all-comers.  Then I followed them tothe parapet.The moon was about full and bathing the whole roof, and all thecountryside in liquid light.  There was a certain amount of mistlower down, and you could only make out the Dead Sea through ithere and there;  but up where we were, and even in the moateighty feet below us, it was almost like daylight without theglare and heat.  I leaned over, but could see nobody in the moat,and there was no sign of Mahommed ben Hamza.Abdul Ali led the way toward the corner where Grim had given hisorders to ben Hamza that afternoon.  Abdul Ali did not seem torealize that I was following.  When he turned at last, with hisback to the parapet and the moonlight full in his face, hedemanded in German:"Wass machen Sie hier?"I was about to answer him when there came a noise likesubterranean thunder from the mouth of the stairway.  They weretrying to force that door below and follow us.  The first words Iused were in English, for Grim's benefit:"I stuck a stick in the door.  I should say it's good for ten orfifteen minutes unless they use explosives."That gave the whole game away at once."So!" said Abdul Ali.  He thrust the wallet into his bosom.  Withthe other hand he pulled out a repeating pistol.  "So!"Grim said never a word.  He closed with him.  In a second we wereall three struggling like madmen.  The pistol was not cocked;  Imanaged to get hold of Abdul Ali's wrist and wrench the weaponaway before he could pull back the slide.  Then we all three wentdown together on the stone roof, Abdul Ali yelling like a maniac,and Grim trying to squeeze the wind out of him.  Even then, as werolled and fought, I could still hear the thundering on the door.No doubt the noise they made prevented them from hearing AbdulAli's yells for help.The man's strength was prodigious, although he was puffy andshort-winded.  It began to look as if we would have to knock himon the head to get control of him.  But even so, there was norope--no sign of Mahommed ben Hamza and his men.  You can thinkof a lot of things while you fight for your life eighty milesaway from help.  I wondered whether Grim would throw him over theparapet, and whether we two would have to take our chance ofmountaineering down that ragged corner of the wall.But suddenly about a hundred and eighty pounds of human brawnlanded feet-first on my back.  A voice said "Taib,* Jimgrim!" andtwo other men jumped after him from somewhere on the ruined wallabove us.  In another second Abdul Ali was held hand and foot,tied until he could not move, and then a wheat-sack was pulleddown over his head and made fast between his legs. [*All right.]"You're late!" said Grim.  "Quick!  Where's the rope?  Are yourmen below?"The thundering on the door had ceased.  Either they were comingup the steps already, or had gone to reach the parapet some otherway.  It did not occur to me, or for that matter to any of us inthe excitement of the minute, that they might be holding aconsultation below, or might even have abandoned the idea offollowing, although I think now that must be the explanation, forwhat we did took more time than it takes to set it down.Ben Hamza made one end of the rope fast around Abdul Ali's feet.He would not listen to argument.  He said he knew his business,and certainly the knot was workmanlike.  Then he called over theparapet (an Arab never whistles) and a voice answered from thesouthern side of the moat, where some fallen stones cast ashadow.  Then the three of them lifted Abdul Ali over, andlowered him head-first.It was a slow business, for otherwise he would have been stunnedagainst the first projection.  I thought that Grim looked almostas nervous as I felt, but Mahommed ben Hamza was having the timeof his life, and could not keep his tongue still."Head upwards a man can yell," he explained to me, grinning fromear to ear.  "Feet upwards, too afraid to yell!"  Then thethundering on the door began again, louder than before it seemedto me.  They were using a battering-ram.  But they were too late.After what seemed like a long-drawn hour we saw shadowy armsbelow reach up and seize our prisoner.  Then the loose rope cameup again hand over hand."You next!" said Grim quietly.  He pushed me forward, aftercarefully examining the loop Mahommed ben Hamza tied in the endof the rope.Chapter Ten"Money doesn't weigh much!"Well--you don't stand on precedence or ceremony at times likethat.  Over I went in the bight of the rope.  They let me fallabout fifteen feet before they seemed to realize that I had letgo of the parapet.  Added to all that had gone before, that madeabout the climax of sensation.  The pain of barking the skin ofknees and elbows against projecting angles of stone was a relief.I am no man of iron.  I haven't iron nerves.  Not one second ofthat descent was less than hell.  I could hear the thunder ofsome kind of battering-ram on the door at the foot of the stair.I could imagine the rope chafing against the sharp edge of theparapet as they paid it out hand over hand.  The only thing thatmade me keep my head at all was knowledge that Abdul Ali had hadto do the trip feet-upward, with his head in a bag.  When theylet go too fast it was rather like the half-way stage of takingchloroform.  When they slowed up, there was the agonizing dreadof pursuit.  And through it all there burned the torturingsuggestion that the rope might break.Mother Earth felt good that night, when strong hands reached upand lifted me out of the noose that failed of reaching the bottomby about a man's height.  Come to think of it, it wasn't motherearth at that.  It was the stinking carcass of a camel only halfautopsied by the vultures, that my feet first rested on--brother,perhaps, to the beast I had put out of his agony that afternoon.The others came down the rope hand-over-hand, Grim last.  Isuppose he stayed up there with his pistol, ready for contingencies.He had his nerve with him, for he had fastened the upper end ofthe rope to a piece of broken stone laid across a gap that thecrusaders had made in the ramparts, centuries ago, for the Christianpurpose of pouring boiling oil and water on their foes.  It did nottake more than a minute's violent shaking after he got down to bringthe rope tumbling on our heads.Then the next thing he did was to take a look at the prisoner.Finding him not much the worse for wear, barring some bruises anda missing inch or two of skin, he ordered the bag pulled over hishead again and gave the order for retreat.  Mahommed ben Hamzawent scouting ahead.  The others picked up Abdul Ali as theconstruction gangs handle baulks of timber--horizontal--face-downward.  When he wriggled they cuffed him into good behaviour.You have to get down into an Arab moat before you can realizewhat the Hebrews meant by their word Gehenna.  The smell ofrotting carrion was only part of it.  One stumbled into, andthrough, and over things that should not be.  Heaps, that lookedsolid in the moonlight, yielded to the tread.  Whatever liquidlay there was the product of corruption.Yet we did not dare to climb out of the moat until we reached theshadows at the northern angle.  Though the moonlight shone almoststraight down on us it was a great deal brighter up above, andthe walls cast some shadow.  There was nothing for it but to pickour way in the comparative gloom of that vulture's paradise,praying we might find a stream to wade in presently.Once, looking up behind me, I thought I saw men's heads peeringover the parapet, but that may have been imagination.  Grim vowedhe did not see them, although I suspected him of saying that toavoid a panic.  He shepherded us along, speaking in a perfectlynormal voice whenever he had to, as if there were no such thingas hurry in the world.  When we reached the farther corner of themoat it was he who climbed out first to con the situation.  Alook-out in a bastion on the ruined town wall promptly firedat him.I expected him to fire back.  I climbed up beside him to lend ahand with the pistol I had filched from Abdul Ali.  But Grimshouted something about taking away for burial the corpse of aman who had died of small-pox.  The man on the wall commanded usto Allah's mercy and warned us to beware lest we, too, catch thatdreaded plague."Inshallah!" Grim answered.  Then he summoned our men fromthe moat.They passed up Abdul Ali, dragging him feet-first again with oneman keeping a clenched fist ready to strike him in the mouth incase he should forget that corpses don't cry out.  He looked likea corpse half-cold, as they carried him jerkily along a trackthat roughly followed the line of the wall.  I don't suppose thatanything ever looked more like an Arab funeral procession than wedid.  The absence of noisy mourners, and the unusual hour ofnight, were plausibly accounted for by the dreaded disease thatGrim had invented for the occasion.  My golf-suit was the onlyfalse note, but I kept in shadow as much as I could, with theunseemly burden between me and the ramparts.It was a long time before we had the town wall at our backs.  Afuneral, in the circumstances, might justifiably be rapid;  butwe could hardly run and keep up the pretense.  But at last wepassed over the shoulder of a hill into shadow on the fartherside, and there was no more need of play-acting."Yalla bilagel!" [Run like the devil.] Grim ordered then, and weobeyed him like sprinters attempting to lower a record.Twelve men running through the night can make a lot of noise,especially when they carry a heavy man between them.  Our menwere all from Hebron.  Hebron prides itself on training theartfullest thieves in Asia.  They boast of being able to stealthe bed from under a sleeper without waking him.  But even thestealthiest animals go crashing away from danger, and, now thatthe worst of the danger lay behind, more or less panic seized allof us.Mahommed ben Hamza refused to follow the regular track, for fearof ambush or a chance encounter in the dark.  Grim let him havehis way.  They dragged the wretched Abdul Ali like a sack of cornby a winding detour, and wherever the narrow path turned sharplyto avoid great rocks they skidded him at the turn until he yelledfor mercy.  Grim pulled off the sack at last, untied his arms andlegs, and let him walk;  but whenever he lagged they frog-marchedhim again.At last we reached a brook where we all waded to get rid of thefilth and smell from that infernal moat, and Abdul Ali seizedthat opportunity to play his last cards.  Considering Ben Hamza'sreputation, the obvious type of his nine ruffians, the darknessand rough handling, it said a lot for Grim's authority that AbdulAli still had that wallet-full of money in his possession.Sitting on a stone in the moonlight, he pulled it out.  His nervewas a politician's, cynical, simple.  Its simplicity almost tookyour breath away."How many men from Hebron?" he demanded."Ten.  Well and good.  I have here ten thousand piastres--onethousand for each of you, or divide it how you like.  That isthe price I will pay you to let me go.  What can these othertwo do to you?  Take the money and run.  Leave me to settle withthese others."Ben Hamza, knee-deep in the brook, laughed aloud as he eyed themoney.  He made a gesture so good-humoured, so full ofresignation and regret and broad philosophy that you would haveliked the fellow even if he hadn't saved your life."Deal with those two first!" he grinned.  "I would have takenyour money long ago, but that I know Jimgrim!  He would have mademe give it up again.""Jimgrim!" said Abdul Ali.  "Jimgrim?  Are you Major James Grim?A good thing for you I did not know that, when I had you in mypower in the castle!"Grim laughed.  "Are we all set? Let's go."We hurried all the faster now because our legs were wet.  Thenight air on those Moab heights is chilly at any season.Perhaps, too, we were trying to leave behind us the moat-stenchthat the water had merely reduced, not washed away.  A quarter ofa mile before we reached the place appointed we knew that Anazehhad not failed to keep his tryst.  Away up above us, beside thetomb, like an ancient bearded ghost, Anazeh stood motionless,silent, conning the track we should come by--a grand old savagekeeping faith against his neighbours for the sake of friendship.He did not challenge when he heard us.  He took aim.  He held hisaim until Grim called to him.  When our goat track joined themain road he was there awaiting us, standing like a sentinel inthe shadow of a fanged rock.  And there, if, Abdul Ali ofDamascus could have had his way, there would have been a freshdebate.  He did not let ten seconds pass before he had offeredAnazeh all the money he had with him to lend him a horse and lethim go.  Anazeh waived aside the offer."You shall have as much more money as you wish!" the Damasceneinsisted.  "Let me get to my house, and a messenger shall takethe money to you.  Or come and get it."All the answer Anazeh gave him was a curt laugh--one bark likea Fox's."Where are all the horses?" Grim demanded.  I could only see fiveof six."I wait for them.""Man, we can't wait!""Jimgrim!" said the old sheikh, with a glint of something betweenmalice and amusement in his eyes, "I knew you in the mejlis whenyou watched me read that letter!  One word from me and--"  Hemade a click between his teeth suggestive of swift death.  "I letyou play your game.  But now I play my game, Allah willing.  Ihave waited for you.  Wait thou for me!""Why?  What is it?"Anazeh beckoned us and turned away.  We followed him, Grim and I,across the road and up a steep track to the tomb on theoverhanging rock, where he had stood when we first saw him.He pointed.  A cherry-red fire with golden sparks and crimson-bellied sulphur smoke was blazing in the midst of El-Kerak."The home of Abdul Ali of Damascus," said Anazeh with pride inhis voice.  It was the pride of a man who shows off the behaviourof his children.  "My men did it!""How can they escape?" Grim asked him."Wallah!  Will the gate guards stand idle?  Will they not run tothe fire--and to the looting?  But they will find not much loot.My men already have it!""Loot," said Grim, "will delay them.""Money doesn't weigh much," Anazeh answered.  "Here my men come."Somebody was coming.  There came a burst of shooting and yellingfrom somewhere between us and El-Kerak, and a moment later thethunder of horses galloping full-pelt.  Anazeh got down to theroad with the agility of a youngster, ordered Abdul Ali ofDamascus, the shivering Ahmed and me under cover.  He placed hisremaining handful of men at points of vantage where they couldcover the retreat of the fifteen.  And it was well he did.There were at least two score in hot pursuit, and though youcould hardly tell which was which in that dim light, Anazeh'sparty opened fire on the pursuers and let the fifteen through.  Idid not get sight of Grim while that excitement lasted, but hehad two automatics.  He took from me the one that I had takenfrom Abdul Ali, and with that one and his own he made a dinlike a machine-gun.  He told me afterward that he had fired inthe air."Noise is as good as knock-outs in the dark," he explained, whileAnazeh's men boasted to one another of the straight shooting thatit may be they really believed they had done.  An Arab canbelieve anything--afterward.  I don't believe one man was killed,though several were hit.At any rate, whether the noise accomplished it or not, thepursuers drew off, and we went forward, carrying a cashbox now,of which Abdul Ali was politely requested to produce the key.That was the first intimation he had that his house had beenlooted.  He threw his bunch of keys away into the shadows, in thefirst exhibition of real weakness he had shown that night.  Itwas a silly gesture.  It only angered his captors.  It saved himnothing.Four more of Anazeh's men had been wounded, all from behind, twoof them rather badly, making six in all who were now unfit forfurther action.  But we did not wait to bandage them.  Theyaffected to make light of their injuries, saying they would goover to the British and get attended to in hospital.  Abdul Aliwas put on Ahmed's miserable mount, with his legs lashed underthe horse's belly.  Ahmed, with Mahommed ben Hamza and his menwere sent along ahead;  being unarmed, unmounted, they were aliability now.  But those Hebron thieves could talk like anarmy;  they put up a prodigious bleat, all night long, aboutthat cash-box.  They maintained they had a clear right to shareits contents, since unless they had first captured Abdul Ali,Anazeh's men could not have burned his house and seizedhis money.  Anazeh's men, when they had time to be, weresuitably amused.It was not a peaceful retreat by any means.  Time and againbefore morning we were fired on from the rear.  Our partydeployed to right and left to answer--always boasting afterwardof having killed at least a dozen men.  I added up their figureson the fly-leaf of the pocket Bible, and the total came to twohundred and eighteen of the enemy shot dead and forever damned!I believe Anazeh actually did kill one of our pursuers.By the time the moon disappeared we had come too close toAnazeh's country to make pursuit particularly safe.  Who theywere who pursued us, hauled off.  We reached the launch, securein its cove between the rocks, a few minutes after dawn.  Anazehordered his six wounded men into it, with perfect assurancethat the British doctors would take care of them and let themgo unquestioned.When Grim had finished talking with Anazeh I went up to thank theold fellow for my escort, and he acknowledged the courtesy with abow that would have graced the court of Solomon."Give the old bird a present, if you've got one," Grim whispered.So I gave him my watch and chain, and he accepted them with thesame calm dignity."Now he's your friend for life!" said Grim.  "Anazeh is a friendworth having.  Let's go!"The watch and chain was a cheap enough price to pay for that twodays' entertainment and the acquaintance of such a splendid oldking of thieves.  Anazeh watched us away until we were out ofearshot, he and Grim exchanging the interminable Arab farewellformula of blessing and reply that have been in use unchanged fora thousand years.Then Abdul Ali produced his wallet again."Major Grim," he said, "please take this money.  Keep it foryourself, and let me go.  Surely I have been punished enough!Besides, you cannot--you dare not imprison me!  I am a Frenchsubject.  I have been seized outside the British sphere.  I knowyou are a poor man--the pay of a British officer is a matter ofcommon knowledge.  Come now, you have done what you came to do.You have destroyed my influence at El-Kerak.  Now benefityourself.  Avoid an international complication.  Show mercy onme!  Take this money.  Say that I gave you the slip in the dark!"Grim smiled.  He looked extremely comical without any eyebrows.The wrinkles went all the way up to the roots of his hair."I'm incorruptible," he said.  "The boss, I believe, isn't.""You mean your High Commissioner?  I have not enough moneyfor him."Grim laughed.  "No," he said, "he comes expensive.""What then?""Don't be an ass," said Grim. "You know what.""Information?""Certainly.""What information?""You were sent by the French," said Grim, "to raise the devilhere in Palestine--no matter why.  You were trying to bringoff a raid on Judaea.  Who are your friends in Jerusalem whowere ready to spring surprises?  What surprises?  Who's yourJerusalem agent?""If I tell you?""I'm not the boss.  But I'll see him about it.  Come on--who'syour agent?""Scharnhoff."Grim whistled.  That he did not believe, I was almost certain,but he whistled as if totally new trains of thought had suddenlyrevealed themselves amid a maze of memories."You shall speak to the boss," he said after a while.I fell asleep then, wedged uncomfortably between two men's legs,wakened at intervals by the noisy pleading of Mahommed ben Hamzaand his men for what they called their rights in the matter ofAbdul Ali's wallet.  They were still arguing the point when weran on the beach near Jericho, where a patrol of incredulousSikhs pounced on us and wanted to arrest Ahmed and Anazeh'swounded men.  Grim had an awful time convincing them that he wasa British officer.  In the end we only settled it by trampingabout four miles to a guard-house, where a captain in uniformgave us breakfast and telephoned for a commisariat lorry.It was late in the afternoon when we reached Jerusalem and gotthe wounded into hospital.  By the time Grim had changed intouniform and put courtplaster where his eyebrows should have been,and he, Abdul Ali and I had driven in an official Ford up theMount of Olives to OETA, the sun was not far over the skyline.Grim had telephoned, so the Administrator was waiting for us.Grim went straight in.  It was twenty minutes before we two weresummoned into his private room, where he sat behind the deskexactly as we had left him the other morning.  He looked as if hehad not moved meanwhile.  Everything was exactly in its place--even the vase, covering the white spot on the varnish.  There wasthe same arrangement of too many flowers, in a vase too small tohold them."Allow me to present Sheikh Abdul Ali of Damascus," said Grim.The Administrator bowed rather elaborately, perhaps to hidethe twinkle in his eyes.  He didn't scowl.  He didn't looktyrannical.  So Abdul Ali opened on him, with all bow guns."I protest!  I am a French subject.  I have been submitted toviolence, outrage, indignity!  I have been seized on foreignsoil, and brought here by force against all internationallaw!  I shall claim exemplary damages!  I demand apologyand satisfaction!"Sir Louis raised his eyebrows and looked straight at Grim withouteven cracking a smile."Is this true, Major Grim?""Afraid it is, sir.""Scandalous!  Perfectly scandalous!  And were you a witness toall this?" he asked, looking at me as if I might well be thecause of it all.I admitted having seen the greater part of it."And you didn't protest?  What's the world coming to?  I seeyou've lost a little skin yourself.  I hope you've not beenbreaking bounds and fighting?""He is a most impertinent man!" said Abdul Ali, trying to takehis cue, and glowering at me.  "He posed as a person interestedin a school for El-Kerak, and afterward helped capture me bya trick!"The Administrator frowned.  It seemed I was going to be made thescape-goat.  I did not care.  I would not have taken a year ofSir Louis' pay for those two days and nights.  When he spokeagain I expected something drastic addressed to me, but Iwas wrong."An official apology is due to you, Sheikh Abdul Ali.  Permit meto offer it, together with my profound regret for any slightpersonal inconvenience to which you may have been subjected incourse of this--ah--entirely unauthorized piece of--ah--brigandage.  I notice you have been bruised, too.  You shall havethe best medical attention at our disposal.""That is not enough!" sneered Abdul Ali, throwing quitean attitude."I know it isn't.  I was coming to that.  An apology is also dueto the French--our friends the French.  I shall put it inwriting, and ask you to convey it to Beirut to the French HighCommissioner, with my compliments.  I would send you by train,but you might be--ah--delayed at Damascus in that case.  PerhapsEmir Feisal might detain you.  There will be a boat going fromJaffa in two days' time.  Two days will give you a chance torecover from the outrageous experience before we escort you tothe coast.  A first-class passage will be reserved for you bywire, and you will be put on board with every possible courtesy.You might ask the French High Commissioner to let me know ifthere is anything further he would like us to do about it.  Now,I'll ring for a clerk to take you to the medical officer--underescort, so that you mayn't be subjected to further outrage orindignity.  Good evening!""Anything more for me?" asked Grim, as soon as Abdul Ali had beenled away."Not tonight, Grim.  Come and see me in the morning." Grimsaluted.  The Administrator looked at me--smiled mischievously."Have a good time?" he asked.  "Don't neglect those scratches.Good evening!"No more.  Not another word.  He never did say another word to meabout it, although I met him afterwards a score of times.  Youcouldn't help but admire and like him.Grim led the way up the tower stairs again, and we took a lastlook at El-Kerak.  The moon was beginning to rise above the rimof the Moab Hills.  The land beyond the Dead Sea was wrapped inutter silence.  Over to the south-east you could make out one dotof yellow light, to prove that men lived and moved and had theirbeing in that stillness.  Otherwise, you couldn't believe it wasreal country.  It looked like a vision of the home of dreams."Got anything to do tonight?" asked Grim.  "Can you stay awake?I know where some Jews are going to play Beethoven in an upperroom in the ancient city.  Care to come?"Chapter Eleven"And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah--"I have no idea what Grim did during the next few days.  I spentthe time studying Arabic, and saw nothing of him until he walkedinto my room at the hotel one afternoon, sat down and camestraight to the point."Had enough?""No.""Got the hang of it?""Yes, I think so," I answered.  "Allah's peace, as they call it,depends on the French.  They intend to get Damascus and allSyria.  So they sent down Abdul Ali of Damascus to make troublefor the British in Palestine;  the idea being to force theBritish to make common cause with them.  That would mean totaldefeat for the Arabs;  and Great Britain would save France scadsof men and money.  But you pulled that plug.  I saw you do it.  Iheard Abdul Ali of Damascus tell you Scharnhoff's name.  Did yougo after Scharnhoff?""No, not yet," he answered.  "You're no diplomat."I knew that.  I have never wished to be one, never having met aprofessional one who did not, so to speak, play poker with a colddeck and at least five aces.  The more frankly they seem to betelling the truth, the more sure you may be they are lying."Neither are you," I answered.  "You're a sportsman.  Are youallowing Scharnhoff weight for age, and a fair start--or what?"He chuckled.  "You believed old Abdul-Ali of Damascus?  He's aFrench secret political agent.  So whatever he told us iscertainly not true.  Or, if it is true, or partially true, thenit's the kind of truth that is deadlier deceptive than a goodclean God-damned lie.  Get this:  such men as Abdul Ali wouldface torture rather than betray an associate--unless they're surethe associate is a traitor or about to become one.  A governmentcan't easily punish its own spies on foreign territory.  But bybetraying them, it can sometimes get the other government to doit.  That Abdul Ali betrayed Scharnhoff to me, proves one of twothings.  Abdul Ali was lying, and Scharnhoff harmless--or insome way Scharnhoff has fallen foul of his French paymastersand they want him punished.  Very likely he has drawn Frenchmoney, for their purposes, and has misused it for his own ends.Or perhaps they have promised him money, and wish to back down.Possibly he knows too much about their agents, and they wanthim silenced.  They propose to have us silence him.  I'm goingto call on Scharnhoff.""You suspect him of double treachery?""I suspect him of being a one-track-minded, damned oldvisionary."I had met Hugo Scharnhoff.  Long before the War he had been aprofessor of orientology at Vienna University.  At the moment hewas technically an "enemy alien."  But he had lived so many yearsin Jerusalem, and was reputed so studious and harmless, that theBritish let him stay there after Allenby captured the city.  Aman of moderate private means, he owned a stone house in theGerman Colony with its back to the Valley of Hinnom."Care to come?" Grim asked me."Yes.""Know your Bible?"  He proceeded to quote from it:  "And the restof the acts of Ahaziah which he did are they not written in thebook of the chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"'"What of it?""That was set down in Aramaic, nowadays called Hebrew, somethinglike three thousand years ago," said Grim.  "It's Aramaic magic.Let's take a look at it."We trudged together down the dusty Bethlehem Road, turned to theeast just short of the Pool of the Sultan (where they now had adelousing station for British soldiers) and went nearly to theend of the colony of neat stone villas that the Germans builtbefore the War, and called Rephaim.  It was a prosperous colonyuntil the Kaiser, putting two and two, made five of them and hadto guess again.The house we sought stood back from the narrow road, at a corner,surrounded by a low stone wall and a mass of rather dense shrubsthat obscured the view from the windows.  The front door was athing of solid olive-wood.  We had to hammer on it for severalminutes.  There was no bell.A woman opened it at last--an Arab in native costume, gazelle-eyed, as they all are, and quite good looking, although hardly inher first youth.  Her face struck me as haunted.  She was eitherashamed when her eyes met Grim's or else afraid of him.  But shesmiled pleasantly enough and without asking our business led theway at once to a room at the other end of a long hall that wascrowded with all sorts of curios.  They were mostly stone bric-a-brac-fragments of Moabite pottery and that kind of thing, with apretty liberal covering of ordinary house dust.  In fact, thehouse had the depressing "feel" of a rarely visited museum.The room she showed us into was the library--three walls linedwith books, mostly with German titles--a big cupboard in onecorner, reaching from floor to ceiling--a big desk by thewindow--three armchairs and a stool.  There were no pictures,and the only thing that smacked of ornament was the Persian rugon the floor.We waited five minutes before Scharnhoff came in, looking as ifwe had disturbed his nap.  He was an untidy stout man with greengoggles and a grayish beard, probably not yet sixty years of age,and well preserved.  He kept his pants up with a belt, and hisshirt bulged untidily over the top.  When he sat down you couldsee the ends of thick combinations stuffed into his socks.  Hegave you the impression of not fitting into western clothes atall and of being out of sympathy with most of what they represent.He was cordial enough--after one swift glance around the room."Brought a new acquaintance for you," said Grim, introducingme.  "I've told him how all the subalterns come to you forPalestinian lore--""Ach!  The young Lotharios!  Each man a Don Juan!  All they cometo me for is tales of Turkish harems, of which I know no morethan any one.  They are not interested in subjects of realimportance.  'How many wives had Djemal Pasha?  How many of themwere European?'  That is what they ask me.  When I discussancient history it is only about King Solomon's harem that theycare to know;  or possibly about the modern dancing girls of El-Kerak, who are all spies.  But there is no need to inform you asto that.  Eh?  I haven't seen you for a long time, Major Grim.What have you been doing?""Nothing much.  I was at the Tomb of the Kings yesterday."Scharnhoff smiled scornfully."Now you must have some whiskey to take the taste of that untruthout of your mouth!  How can a man of your attainments call thatobviously modern fraud by such a name?  The place is not nearlytwo thousand years old!  It is probably the tomb of a Syrianqueen named Adiabene and her family.  Josephus mentions it.  Thisland is full--every square metre of it--of false antiquities withreal names, and real antiquities that never have been discovered!But why should a man like you, Major Grim, lend yourself toperpetuating falsity?"He walked over to the cupboard to get whiskey, and from where wesat we could both of us see what he was doing.  The cupboard wasin two parts, top and bottom, without any intervening strip ofwood between the doors, which fitted tightly.  When he opened thetop part the lower door opened with it.  He kicked it shut againat once, but I had seen inside--not that it was interesting atthe moment.He set whiskey and tumblers on the desk, poured liberally, andwent on talking."Tomb of the Kings?  Hah!  Tomb of the Kings of Judah?  Hah!  Ifany one can find that, he will have something more important thanLudendorff's memoirs!  Something merkwurdig, believe me!"He stiffened suddenly, and looked at Grim through the greengoggles as if he were judging an antiquity."Perhaps this is not the time to make you a little suggestion, eh?"Grim's face wrinkled into smiles."This man knows enough to hang me anyhow!  Fire away!""Ah!  But I would not like him to hang me!""He's as close as a clam.  What's your notion?""Nothing serious, but--between us three, then--you and I are bothforeigners in this place, Major Grim, although I have made it myhome for fifteen years.  You have no more interest in thisgovernment and its ridiculous rules than I have.  What do yousay--shall we find the Tomb of the Kings together?"Grim wrinkled into smiles again and glanced down at his uniform."Yes, exactly!" agreed Scharnhoff.  "That is the whole point.They call me an enemy alien.  I am to all intents and purposes aprisoner.  You are a British officer--can do what you like--gowhere you like.  You wear red tabs;  you are on the staff;nobody will dare to question you.  These English have stopped allexploration until they get their mandate.  After that they willtake good care that only English societies have the explorationprivilege.  But what if we--you and I, that is to say--betweenus extract the best plum from the pudding before those miscalledstatesmen sign the mandate--eh?  It can be done!  It can be done!"Grim chuckled:"I suppose you already see a picture of you and me with anancient tomb in our trunks--say a few tons of the more artisticparts--beating it for the frontier and hawking the stuffafterward to second-hand furniture dealers?  Pour me anotherwhiskey, prof, and then we'll go steal the Mosque of Omar!""Ach!  You laugh at me--you jest--you mock--you sneer.  But Iknow what I propose.  Do you know what will be found in that Tombof the Kings of Judah when we discover it?""Bones.  Dry bones.  A few gold ornaments perhaps.  A stalesmell certainly.""The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel!  Think of it!A parchment roll--perhaps two or three rolls--not too big to gointo a valise--worth more than all the other ancient manuscriptsin the world all put together!  Himmel!  What a find that wouldbe!  What a record!  What a refutation of all the historians andthe fools who set themselves up for authorities nowadays!  What aprice it would bring!  What would your Metropolitan Museum in NewYork not pay for it!  What would the Jews not pay for it!  Theywould raise millions among them and pay any price we caredto ask!  The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel--only think!""But why the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel in the tomb of theKings of Judah?" Grim asked, more by way of keeping up theconversation, I think, than because he could not guess theanswer.  He is an omnivorous reader, and there is not muchrecorded of the Near East that he does not know."Don't you know your history?  You know, of course, that afterKing Solomon died the Jews divided into two kingdoms.  Thelatter-day Jews speak of themselves as Israelites, but they arenothing of the kind;  they are Judah-ites.  The tribe of Judahremained in Jerusalem, forming one small kingdom;  theirdescendants are the Jews of today.  Part of the tribe of Benjaminstayed with them.  The other seceding ten tribes calledthemselves the kingdom of Israel.""Everybody knows that," said Grim.  "What of it?""Well, the Assyrians came down and conquered the kingdom ofIsrael--marched all the Israelites away into captivity--and theyvanished out of history.  From that day to this their Book ofChronicles, so often referred to in the Old Testament, has neverbeen seen nor heard of.""Of course not," said Grim.  "The King of Assyria used it to wipehis razor on when he was through shaving every morning.""Ach!  You joke again;  but I tell you I am not joking.  Suchpeople as those Hebrews are naturally secretive and so proud thatthey wrote down for posterity all the doings of their puny kings,would never have let their records fall into the hands of theAssyrians.  They themselves were marched away in slave-gangs, butthey left their Book behind them, safely hidden.  Be sure of it!Ten years ago I found a manuscript in the place they now callNablus, which in those days was Schechem.  Schechem was thecapital of the Kingdom of Israel, just as Jerusalem was thecapital of the Kingdom of Judah, or the Jews.  I sold thatmanuscript for a good price after I had photographed it.  Theidiots to whom I sold it--historians they call themselves!--valueit only as a relic of antiquity.  I made a digest of it--analyzedit--studied it--compared it with other authentic facts in mypossession--and came to the definite conclusion that I hold theclue to the whereabouts of that lost Book of Chronicles.""Let's see the photograph," Grim suggested."It has been impounded with other so-called 'enemy property' byyour friends the British.  I suppose they thought the GermanGeneral Staff might get hold of it and conquer the Suez Canal!But what good would the sight of it do?  You couldn't understanda word of it.  It convinced me, after months of study, that whenthe Ten Tribes were carried away into captivity by the Assyriansthey sent their records secretly to Jerusalem.  Ever since thesecession the Israelites and Jews had been jealous enemies.  Butthey were relatives after all, boasting a common ancestor, proudof the same history, more or less observing the same religion.And Schechem was only about thirty miles from Jerusalem, whichwas considered an impregnable fortress until the Babylonians tookit later on.  So they sent their records to Jerusalem, and theJews hid them.  Where?  Where do you suppose?""The likeliest place would be Solomon's Temple.""You think so?  Then you think superficially, my young friend.Let us return to that Tomb of the Kings again for a moment.  Thatplace that you visited is such an obvious fake that even theguide-books make light of it.  The one all-important thing inPalestine that never yet has been discovered is the real Tomb ofthe Kings.  Yet Jerusalem, where it certainly must be, has beensearched and looted a hundred times from end to end.  Therefore--you follow me?--the Jews must have concealed it very cunningly.Answer me, then:  would the Jews, who were always a practicalpeople and not corpse-worshippers like the Egyptians, have takenall that trouble to hide the tomb of their kings unless therewere important treasure in it?  Answer me!""So you expect to find treasure in addition to the lost Book ofChronicles?""Certainly I do!  The treasure will make the whole proceedingsafe.  Let the British have it!  The fools will be so blinded bythe glamour of gold, that I shall easily extract the things ofreal value--the invaluable manuscripts!  Then let the men whocall themselves historians take a back seat!"He rubbed his hands together in anticipation."Were you looking for the Tomb of the Kings, then, before theWar?" Grim asked him."Not exactly.  Under the Turks it was difficult.  The Turks werebeautifully corrupt.  By paying for it I could get permission toexcavate on any property owned by Christians.  But the minute Itouched Moslem places the Turks became fanatical.  The Arabs,now, are different--fanatics, too, but with a new sort offanaticism--new to them, I mean--the kind that made the Frenchrevolutionists destroy everything their ancestors had set valueon.  There are plenty of Arabs so full of this disease ofBolshevism that they would make it easy for me to desecrate whatothers believe is holy ground.  But these idiots of English areworse than the Turks!  They have stopped all excavation.  Theyare so afraid of Bolshevism that, if they could, they wouldimitate Joshua and make the sun stand still!""Well, what's the idea?" asked Grim, finishing his whiskey.Scharnhoff shrugged his shoulders."You know my position.  I am helpless--here on suffrance--obligedby idiotic regulations to sit in idleness.  But if I could find aBritish officer with brains--surely there must be one somewhere!--one with some authority, who is considered above suspicion, Icould show him, perhaps, how to get rich without committing anycrime he need feel ashamed of."I could not see Grim's eyes from where I sat, and he did not makeany nervous movement that could have given him away.  Yet I wasconscious of a new alertness, and I think Scharnhoff detected it,too, for he changed his tactics on the instant."Hah! Hah!  I was joking!  Nobody who is fool enough to be aprofessional soldier would be clever enough to find the Tomb ofthe Kings and keep the secret for ten minutes!  Hah! Hah!  But Ihave a favour I would like to beg of you, Major Grim.""I've no particular authority, you know.""Ach!  The Administrator listens to you;  I am assured of that.""He listens sometimes, yes, then usually does the other thing.Well, what's the request?""A simple one.  There is a risk--not much, but just a little riskthat some fool might stumble on that secret of the Tomb of theKings and get away with the treasure.  Now, did you ever set athief to catch a thief?  Hah! Hah!  I would be a better watch-dogthan any you could find.  I know Jerusalem from end to end.  Iknow all the likely places.  Why don't you get permission for meto wander about Jerusalem undisturbed and keep my eye open fortomb-robbers?  If I am not to have the privilege of discoveringthat Book of Chronicles, at least I would like to see that nocommon plunderer gets it.  Surely I am known by now to beharmless!  Surely they don't suspect me any longer of being anagent of the Kaiser, or any such nonsense as that!  Why not makeuse of me?  Get me a permit, please, Major Grim, to go where Iplease by day or night without interference.  Tomb-robbersusually work at night, you know.""All right," said Grim.  "I'll try to do that.""Ah!  I always knew you were a man of good sense!  Have morewhiskey?  A cigar then?""Can't promise anything, of course," said Grim, "but you shallhave an answer within twenty-four hours."Outside, as we turned our faces toward Jerusalem's gray wall,Grim opened up a little and gave me a suggestion of something inthe wind."Did you see what he has in that cupboard?""Yes.  Two Arab costumes.  Two short crow-bars.""Did you notice the grayish dust on the rug--three or fourfootprints at the corner near the cupboard?""Can't say I did.""No.  You wouldn't be looking for it.  These men who pose asintellectuals never believe that any one else has brains.  Theyfool themselves.  There's one thing no man can afford to do, Eastof the sun or West of the moon.  You can steal, slay, intrigue,burn--break all the Ten Commandments except one, and have achance to get away with it.  There's just one thing you can't do,and succeed.  He's done it!""And the thing is?""Cheat a woman!""You mean his house keeper?  She who answered the door?"Grim nodded.Chapter Twelve"You know you'll get scuppered if you're found out!"Two days passed again without my seeing Grim, although I calledon him repeatedly at the "Junior Staff Officers' Mess" below theZionist Hospital.  Suliman, the eight-year-old imp of Arabmischief, who did duty as page-boy met me on each occasion at thedoor and took grinning delight in disappointing me.He was about three and a half feet high--coal-black, with atarboosh worn at an angle on his kinky hair and a flashing whitegrin across his snub-nosed face that would have made an archangelcount the change out of two piastres twice.  Suliman and coolcheek were as obvious team-mates as the Gemini, and I was one ofa good number, that included every single member of thatunofficial mess, who could never quite see what Grim found soadmirable in him.  Grim never explained.Taking the cue from his master, neither did Suliman everexplain anything to any one but Grim, who seemed to understandhim perfectly."Jimgrim not here.  No, not coming back.  Much business.Good-bye!"Somehow you couldn't suspect that kid of telling the truth.However, there was nothing for it but to go away, with aconviction in the small of your back that he was grinningmischievously after you.Grim had found him one day starving and lousy in the archway ofthe Jaffa Gate, warming his fingers at a guttering candle-endpreparatory to making a meal off the wax.  He took him home andmade Martha, the old Russian maid-of-all-work, clean him withkerosene and soft soap--gave him a big packing-case to sleepin along with Julius Caesar the near-bull-dog mascot--andthereafter broke him in and taught him things seldom includedin a school curriculum.In the result, Suliman adored Grim with all the concentrated zealof hero-worship of which almost any small boy is capable;  butunder the shadow of Grim's protection he feared not even "brass-hats" nor regarded civilians, although he was dreadfully afraidof devils.  The devil-fear was a relic of his negroid ancestry.Some Arab Sheikh probably captured his great-grandmother on aslave-raid.  Superstition lingers in dark veins longer than anyother human failing.I think I called five times before he confessed at lastreluctantly that Grim was in.  That was in the morning afterbreakfast, and I was shown into the room with the fireplace andthe deep armchairs.  Grim was reading but seemed to me more thanusually reserved, as if the book had been no more than a screento think behind, that left him in a manner unprotected when helaid it down.  I talked at random, and he hardly seemed tobe listening."Say," he said, suddenly interrupting me, "you came out of thatEl-Kerak affair pretty creditably.  Suppose I let you seesomething else from the inside.  Will you promise not to shout itall over Jerusalem?""Use your own judgment," I answered."You mustn't ask questions.""All right.""If any one in the Administration pounces on you in the course ofit, you'll have to drop out and know nothing.""Agreed.""It may prove a bit more risky than the El-Kerak business.""Couldn't be," I answered."You can't talk enough Arabic to get away with.  But could youact deaf and dumb?""Sure--in three languages.""You understand--I've no authority to let you in on this.  Imight catch hell if I were found out doing it.  But I need help,of a certain sort.  I want a man who isn't likely to be spottedby the gang I'm after.  Get behind that screen--quick!"It was a screen that hid a door leading to the pantry and theservants' quarters.  There was a Windsor chair behind it, and itis much easier to keep absolutely still when you are fairlycomfortable.  I had hardly sat down when a man wearing spurs,who trod heavily, entered the room and I heard Grim get up togreet him."Are we alone?" a voice asked gruffly.Instead of answering Grim came and looked behind the screen,opened the door leading to the pantry, closed it again, lockedit, and without as much as a glance at me returned to facehis visitor."Well, general, what is it?""This is strictly secret.""I'll bet it isn't," said Grim.  "If it's about missingexplosives I know more than you do.""My God!  It's out?  Two tons of TNT intended for the air forcegone without a trace?  The story's out?""I know it.  Catesby sent me word by messenger last night fromLudd, after you put him under arrest.""Damn the man!  Well, that's what's happened.  Catesby's fault.They'll blame me.  The truck containing the stuff was run into asiding three days ago.  Through young Catesby's negligence it wasleft there without a guard.  Catesby will be broke for that assure as my name is Jenkins.  But, by the knell of hell's bells,Grim, more than Catesby will lose their jobs unless we find thestuff!  Two tons.  Half enough to blow up Palestine!""Too bad about Catesby," said Grim."Never mind, Catesby.  Damn him!  Consider my predicament!  Howcan I go to the Administrator with a lame-duck story aboutmissing TNT and nothing done about it?""Nothing done?  You've passed the buck, haven't you?  Catesby isunder arrest, you say.""What do you mean?""I know Catesby," Grim retorted quietly.  "He made that finestand at Beersheba--when the Arabs rushed the camp, and youweren't looking.  He took the blame for your carelessness, andnever squealed.  You took the credit for his presence of mind,and have treated him like a dog ever since.  You expect me to tryto save your bacon and forget Catesby's?""Nonsense, Grim!  You're talking without your book.  Here's whathappened:  the stuff arrived at Ludd in a truck attached to theend of a mixed train.  The R.T.O.* sent me a memorandum andstalled the truck on a siding.  I gave the memorandum toCatesby." [*Railway Traffic Officer.]"He tells me in the note I received last night that you didnothing of the kind.""Then he's a liar.  He forgot all about it and did nothing.  Whenthe Air Force sent to get the stuff the truck was empty.""And you want me to find it, I suppose?""Yes.  The quicker the better!""And be a party to breaking Catesby?  I like my job, but notthat much!""You refuse then to hunt for the TNT?""I take my orders straight from the Administrator.  He expects mein half an hour.  You want me to smooth the way for you with SirLouis.  I'm much more interested in Catesby, who would face afiring party sooner than soak another fellow for his own fault.Catesby assures me in writing that the first he ever heard ofthat TNT was when you ordered him arrested after discovery of theloss.  His word goes, as far as I'm concerned.  If you want me tohelp you, find another goat than Catesby.  That's my answer."There followed quite a long pause.  Perhaps Brigadier-GeneralJenkins was wondering what chance he would stand in a show-down.Whoever had heard the mess and canteen gossip knew that Jenkins'career had been one long string of miracles by which he hadattained promotion without in any way deserving it, and aparallel series of even greater ones by which he had savedhimself from ruin by contriving to blame some one else."You want me to white-wash Catesby?" he said at last.  "If youpounce quickly on the TNT, no one need know it was lost.""If you court-martial Catesby, the public shall know who lost it,and who didn't, even if it costs me my commission!""Blast you!  Insubordination!""Is your car outside?" Grim answered.  "Why don't you drive me upto the Administrator and charge me with it?""Don't be an idiot!  I came to you to avoid a scandal.  If thisnews gets out there'll be a panic.  Things are touchy enough asit is.""Yes.""Well--if I drop the charge against Catesby--?""Then I shall not have to fight for him.""I'll see what I can do.""Be definite!""Damn and blast you!  All right, I'll clear Catesby."In that ominous minute, like the devil in an old-time drama,Suliman knocked at the door leading from the outer hall.  Grimopened it, and I heard the boy's voice piping up in Arabic.  TheAdministrator was in his car outside, waiting to know whetherMajor Grim was indoors."Where's your car?" I heard Grim ask."I sent the man to get a tire changed," Jenkins answered."Then Sir Louis needn't know you're here.  Do you want tosee him?""Of course not.""You can get behind that screen if you like."I thought Jenkins would explode when he found me sitting there.He was a big, florid-faced man with a black moustache waxed intopoints, and a neck the color of rare roast beef--a man not givento self-restraint in any shape or form.  But he had to make aquick decision.  Sir Louis' footsteps were approaching.  Heglared at me, made a sign to me to sit still, twisted hismoustache savagely, and listened, breathing through his mouth toavoid the tell-tale whistle of his hairy nostrils.  I heard Grimstart toward the hall, but Sir Louis turned him back and camestraight in."It occurred to me I'd save you the time of coming up to see methis morning, Grim, and look in on you instead before I start myrounds.  Any new developments?""Not yet, sir.  I'll need forty-eight hours.  If we move toofast they may touch the stuff off before we get the whole gangin the net.""You're sure you'd rather not have the police?""Quite.  They mean well, but they're clumsy.""Um-m-m!  All the same, the thing's ticklish.  There are rumoursabout all ready.  The Grand Mufti* came to me before breakfastwith a wild tale.  I've promised him some Sikhs for specialsentry duty.  He'd hardly gone before some Zionists came with astory that the Arabs are planning to blow up their hospital;  Igave them ten men and an officer."  [*The religious head of theMoslem community.]"Is the city quiet?" Grim asked him."Fair to middling.  The Jews refused to take their shutters downthis morning.  I had to issue an order about it.  I hear now thatthey're doing business about as usual, but I've ordered thenumber of men on duty within the city walls to be doubled.  Atthe first sign of disturbance I shall have the gates closed.  Areyou quite sure you're in touch?""Quite. sure, sir.  I'm positive of what I told you last night.Will you be seeing Colonel Goodenough?""Yes, in ten minutes.""Please ask him to hold his Sikhs at my disposal for the next twodays.  You might add, sir, that if he cares to see sport he coulddo worse than lend his own services.""I'll do that.  You can count on Goodenough.  That's a soldierdevoid of nonsense.  Anything else?""That's all.""Keep me informed.  Remember, Grim, I'm responsible for all youdo.  I've endorsed you in blank, as it were.  Don't overlookthat point.""I won't, sir."Sir Louis walked out.  Almost before his spurs ceased jingling inthe tiled hall, Brigadier-General Jenkins strode out in atowering rage from behind the screen."'Pon my soul, a spy's trick!" he exploded.  "Had aneavesdropper, did you?  Listening from behind a screen while youtricked me into a promise on Catesby's account!""Sure," Grim answered, folding the screen back, and lettinghis face wrinkle in smiles all the way up to the roots ofhis hair.  Very comical he looked, for his eyebrows wereonly partly sprouted again.  "Had two of you to listen inon the Administrator!""Endorses you in blank, eh?  How long would he let theendorsement stand if he knew I was behind that screen while hewas talking to you?""Try him!" Grim suggested.  "Shall I call him back?  He doesn'twant to break you--told me so, in fact, last night--but he couldchange his mind, I daresay.  My tip to you is to get back to Luddas fast as your car can take you, release Catesby, and say aslittle as possible to any one!""Damn you for a Yankee!" Jenkins answered.  "You've got mecornered for the moment, and you make the most of it.  But waittill my turn comes!  As for you, sir," Jenkins turned and lookedme up and down with all the arrogance that nice new crossedswords on his shoulder can give a certain sort of man, "don't letme catch you trying to interfere in any Administration business,that's all!"I offered him a cigarette, grinning.  There was no sense inpicking a quarrel.  No man likes to discover that a perfectstranger has overheard his intimate confessions.  His annoyancewas understandable.  But he hadn't nice manners.  He knocked thecigarette case out of my hand and kicked it across the room.  SoI got into one of the deep armchairs and laughed at him in self-defense, to preserve my own temper from boiling up over the top."To hell with both of you!" Jenkins thundered, and strode outlike Mars on the war-path."Poor old Jinks!" said Grim, as soon as he had gone.  "As SirLouis said last night, he has a wife and family besides theunofficial ladies on his string.  All they'll have to dividebetween them soon, at the rate he's going, will be his half-pay.He has fought for promotion all his days, to keep abreast ofexpenses.  What that string of cormorants will do with his fourhundred pounds a year, when he oversteps at last and getsretired, beggars imagination!  However, let's get busy."Business consisted in dressing me up as an Arab with the aid ofSuliman, and drilling me painstakingly for half-an-hour, both ofthem using every trick they knew to make me laugh or showsurprise, and Grim nodding approval each time I contrived not to.More difficult than acting deaf and dumb was the trick ofsquatting with my legs crossed, but I had learned it after afashion in India years ago, and only needed schooling."You'll get scuppered if you're caught," he warned me.  "IfSuliman wasn't so scared of devils I wouldn't risk it, but I musthave somebody to keep an eye on him when the time comes;  that'llbe tomorrow, I think.""Suppose you tell me the object of the game," I suggested.  "I'msick of only studying the rules.""Well--your part will be to sit over those two tons of TNT andsee that nobody explodes them ahead of time.  There's aconspiracy on foot to blow up the Dome of the Rock.""You mean the Mosque of Omar?""The place tourists call the Mosque of Omar.  The site ofSolomon's Temple--the Rock of Abraham--the threshing-floor ofAraunah the Jebusite.  Next after the shrine at Mecca it's themost sacred spot in the whole Mahommedan world.""Good lord!" I said. "Are the Zionists so reckless?"."No, the Arabs are.  Remember what old Scharnhoff said the otherday about the new fanaticism?""Is Scharnhoff mixed up in it?""He's being watched.  If the Arabs pull it off, they'll accusethe Jews of doing it, and set to work to butcher every Jew in theNear East.  That will oblige the British to protect the Jews.That in turn will set every Mohammedan in the world--'speciallyIndians, but Egyptians, too--against the British.  Jihad--greenbanner--holy war--all the East and Northern Africa alight whilethe French snaffle Syria.  Sound good to you?""Sir Louis knows this?""He, is paid to know things.""And he lets you play cat and mouse with it?""Got to be careful.  Suppose we draw the net too soon, what then?Most of the conspirators escape.  The story leaks out.  The Jewsget the blame for the attempt, and sooner or later the massacrebegins anyhow.  What we've got to do is bag every last mother'sson of them, and suppress the whole story--return the TNT tostore, and swear it was never missing.""The Administrator has his nerve," I said."You'll need yours, too, before this game's played," Grimanswered.  "D'you see now why I picked on you for an accomplice?""I do not.""You're the one man in Jerusalem whom nobody will suspect, or beon the look-out for.  The men we're up against are the shrewdestrats in Palestine.  They've got a list of British officers, myname included, of course.  They'll know which men are assigned tospecial duty, and they'll keep every one of us shadowed.""Won't that--I mean, how can you work if you're shadowed?""Me?  I shall catch my spur in the carpet, fall downstairs andbreak a leg at ten-fifteen.  At ten-thirty the doctor comes, andfinds me too badly hurt to be moved.  He sends word of it to SirLouis by an orderly who can be trusted to talk to any one hemeets on the way.  I leave by the back way at ten forty-five.However, here's a chance for you to practise deaf-and-dumb drill.There's some one coming.  Squat down in that corner.  Look meekand miserable.  That's the stuff.  Answer the door, Suliman."Chapter Thirteen"You may now be unsafe and an outlaw and enjoy yourself!"The man who entered was a short, middle-aged Jew of the type thatwrites political reviews for magazines--black morning coat, strawhat, gold pince-nez--a neatly trimmed dark beard beginning toturn gray from intense mental emotion--nearly bald--a manner ofconceding the conventions rather than argue the point, withoutadmitting any necessity for them--a thin-lipped smile thatapologized for smiling in a world so serious and bitter.  He worea U.S.A. ten-dollar gold piece on his watch chain, by way ofestablishing his nationality."Well, Mr. Eisernstein?  Trouble again?  Sit down and let's hearthe worst," said Grim.Eisernstein remained standing and glanced at me over in thecorner."I will wait until you are alone.""Ignore him--deaf and dumb," Grim answered.  "Half a minute,though--have you had breakfast?""Breakfast!  This is no time for eating, Mister--I beg yourpardon, Major Grim.  I have not slept.  I shall not breakmy fast until my duty is done.  If it is true that the EmperorNero fiddled while Rome burned, then I find him no worse thanthis Administrator!""Has he threatened to crucify you?" Grim asked.  "Take aseat, do.""He may crucify me, and I will thank him, if he will only inreturn for it pay some attention to the business for which hedraws a salary!  I drove to Headquarters to see him.  He was notthere.  Nobody would tell me where he is.  I drove down againfrom the Mount of Olives and luckily caught sight of his car inthe distance.  I contrived to intercept him.  I told him there isa plot on foot to massacre every individual of my race in theNear East--a veritable pogrom.  He was polite.  He seems to thinkpoliteness is the Christian quality that covers the multitude ofsins.  He offered me a cigar!"I offered him a telegram blank, with which to cable forreenforcements!  He said that all rumours in Jerusalem becomeexaggerated very quickly, and offered me a guard of one soldierto follow me about!  I insisted on immediate military precautionson a large scale failing which I will cable the Foreign Office inLondon at my own expense.  I offered to convince him withparticulars about this contemplated pogrom but he said he had anurgent appointment and referred me to you, just as Nero mighthave referred a question regarding the amphitheatre to one ofhis subordinates!""Pogroms mean nothing in his young life," Grim answered smiling."I'm here to do the dirty work.  Suppose you spill the news.""You must have heard the news!  Yet you ignore it!  The Moslemsare saying that we Zionists have offered two million pounds, orsome such ridiculous sum, for the site of Solomon's Temple.  Theyare spreading the tale broadcast.  Their purpose is to stir upfanaticism against us.  The ignorant among them set such value onthat rock and the mosque their cut-throat ancestors erected on itthat Jews are now openly threatened as they pass through thestreets.  Yet there is not one word of truth in the story of ourhaving made any such offer.""There are plenty of troops," said Grim.  "Any attempt atviolence could be handled instantly.""Then you will do nothing?""What do you suggest ought to be done?""Here is a list.  Read it.  Those are the names of fifty Arabswho are active in spreading anti-Zionist propaganda."Grim read the list carefully."All talkers," he said.  "Not a really dangerous man among them.""Ah!  There you are!  I might have expected it!"  Eisernsteinthrew up his hands in a gesture of contempt rather than despair."Nobody cares what happens to Jews.  Nobody cares for oursleepless agony of mind.  Nobody cares how or what we sufferuntil afterward, when there will be polite expressions of regret,which the survivors will assess at a true valuation!  It is thesame wherever we turn.  Last night--at half-past one in themorning--a committee of us, every one American, Called at theAmerican consulate to tell our consul of our danger.  The consulwas unsympathetic in the last degree.  Yet our coreligionists inthe States are taxed to pay his salary.  He said it was nothis business.  He referred us to the Administrator.  TheAdministrator refers me to you.  To whom do you refer me?  To thedevil, I suppose!""The best thing you can do," said. Grim, "is to go ahead and denythat story about the offer to buy the Dome of the Rock.  YouZionists have got the most efficient publicity bureau on earth.You can reach the public ear any time you want to.  Deny thestory, and keep on denying it.""Ah!  Who will believe us?  To be a Zionist is to be a personabout whom anybody will believe anything;  and the more absurdthe lie, the more readily it will be believed!  Meanwhile, theMoslems are sharpening their swords against us from one end ofthis land to the other!"I suppose that what Eisernstein really needed more than anythingwas sympathy, not good advice.  Grim's deliberate coolness onlyirritated the passion of a man, whose whole genius and energywere bent on realizing the vision of a nation of Jews firmlyestablished in their ancient home.  A people that has beentortured in turn by all the governments can hardly be expected toproduce un-nervous politicians.  He was at the mercy of emotions,obsessed by one paramount idea.  A little praise just then of hisloyalty to an ideal, to which he had sacrificed time, means,health, energy, everything, would have soothed him and hurtnobody.  But the acidity of his scorn had bitten beneath thesurface of Grim's good humor."There'll be no pogrom," Grim said, getting up and lighting acigarette.  "There'll be nothing resembling one.  But that won'tbe the fault of you Zionists.  You accuse without rime or reason,but you yell for help the minute you're accused yourselves.  Idon't blame the Arabs for not liking you.  Nobody expects Arabsto enjoy having their home invaded by an organization offoreigners.  Yet if this Administration lifts a finger to makethings easier for the Arabs you howl that it's unfair."If the Administrator refuses to arrest Arabs for talking alittle wildly, you call him a Nero.  I'm neither pro- nor anti-Zionist myself.  You and the Arabs may play the game out betweenyou for all of me.  But I can promise you there'll be no pogrom.It is my business to know just what precautions have been taken.""Words! Major Grim.  Words!" sneered Eisernstein, getting up togo.  "What do words amount to, when presently throats are to becut?  If your throat were in danger, I venture to say there wouldbe something doing, instead of mere talk about precautions!  Ihope you will enjoy your little cigarette," he added bitterly."Good morning!""Talk of fiddling while Rome burns!" Grim laughed as soon as theZionist had left the room.  "Has it ever occurred to you thatNero was possibly smothering his feelings?  I wonder how longthere'd be one Zionist left out here, if we simply stood asideand looked on.  Go and change your clothes, Suliman.  It's time Ibroke a leg."Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minuteslater in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, ofEmir Feisul's Syrian army.  Nothing could be smarter, notanything better calculated to disguise a man.  Disguise, as anyactor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make-up as suggestion.  It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits thatidentify.  The suggestion that you are some one else is the thingto strive for, not the concealment of who you really are.Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign underLawrence against the Turks.  The Shereefian helmet is acompromise between the East and West, having a strip of clothhanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering theears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress.The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about itto distinguish it from that of a British officer.  No maninexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it;  for thesimple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough.  YetGrim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard tobelieve he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutesbefore.  His mimicry of the Syrian military walk--blended ofpride and desire not to seem proud--was perfect."I'm now staff-captain Ali Mirza of Feisul's army," he announced."Ali Mirza a man notorious for his anti-British rancor, butsupposed to be down here just now on a diplomatic mission.  I'vebeen seen about the streets like this for the last two days.  Butsay:  that doctor is a long time on the way."He went to the telephone, but did not call the hospital;  thatwould have been too direct and possibly too secret."Give me Headquarters--yes--who's that?--never mind who'sspeaking--say: I can't get the military hospital--something wrongwith the wire--will you call Major Templeton and say that MajorGrim has had an accident--yes, Grim--compound fracture of thethigh--very serious--ask him to go at once to Major Grim'squarters--thanks--that's all."  He returned to the fireplace andstood watching me meditatively for several minutes."If you deceive Templeton, you'll do," he said at last.  "Waita minute."He went to the desk and scribbled something in Arabic on a sheetof paper, sealed that in a blank envelope, and handed it to me."Hide it.  You've two separate and quite distinct tasks, eachmore important and, in a way, dangerous than the other.  Theprincipal danger is to me, not you.  If they spot you, mynumber's as good as hoisted from that minute.  You mustn't kidyourself you're safe for one second until the last card hasbeen played.""Who are 'they'?""I'm coming to that.  Your first job is to make it possible forme to get the confidence of one or two of these conspirators.You're a deaf-and-dumb man--stone deaf--with a message for staff-captain Ali Mirza, which you will only deliver to him in person.Suliman does the talking.  You say nothing.  You simply refuse tohand your message over to any one but me.  They'll appreciate whya deaf and dumb man should be chosen for treasonable business.But perhaps you're scared--maybe you'd rather reconsider it?It's not too late."I snorted."All right.  These conspirators meet at Djemal's coffee shop onDavid Street.  They talk to one another in French, because theproprietor and the other frequenters of the place only knowArabic.  You know French and Arabic enough to understand asentence here and there, so keep your ears wide open.  I shan'tshow up until a Sikh named Narayan Singh tells me that a certainNoureddin Ali is in there.  He's the bird I'm after.  He's adirty little murderer, and I'm going to be right pleasant to him."You may have to sit in the place all day waiting for me;  butwait until after midnight if you must.  Sooner or later NoureddinAli is bound to show up.  I shall be hard after him.  If theyoffer you food, take it.  Eat with your fingers.  Eat like a pig.Lick the plate, if you like.  The nearer mad you seem to be, thesafer you are.  After I get there, hang around until I give youmoney.  Then beat it.""Where to?  I can't go to my room at the hotel in this disguise.""I've thought of that.  You know Cosmopolitan Oil Davey, ofcourse?  He lives at the hotel.  I'll get word to him that he mayexpect a messenger from me after dark tonight.  He'll leave wordwith the porter downstairs, who'll take you to Davey's room.  Youcan tell Davey absolutely anything.  He's white.""Well, I think I can execute that maneuver.  What's tasknumber two?""To sit on the TNT!  But one thing at a time is enough.  Let'sattend to this one first.  Ah!  Here comes Templeton!""Damn you, Grim!" said a calm voice in the doorway.  A tall, leanman in major's uniform with the blue tabs of the medical staffstrode in.  He had the dried-out look of the Sudan, added to theself-reliance that comes of deciding life and death issues at amoment's notice."The hospital is crowded with patients, and here you immobilizeme for half a morning.  I can't pretend to set a compoundfracture in ten minutes, you know!  Why couldn't you break yourneck and have me sign a death certificate?""Didn't occur to me," said Grim.  "But never mind, doc.  You needa rest.  Here's tobacco, lots to read, and an armchair.  Lockyourself in and be happy.""Who's this?" asked Templeton, looking down at me."Deaf and dumb poor devil, earning a few piastres by working forthe Intelligence.""Spy, eh?  He looks fit for honest work if he had all hisfaculties.  Is he dumb as well as deaf, or because he's deaf?""Dunno," said Grim.  "He never speaks.""Perhaps I can do something for him.  Suppose you leave him herewith me.  I can give him a thorough examination instead ofwasting my time here.""He's got a job of work to do right now," said Grim."Does he know the sign language?  Have you any way of telling himto come and see me at the hospital?""I give him written instructions in Arabic.""That so?  I'll look at his ears--tell you in a minute whetherit's worth while to come to me."He took my head between strong, authoritative hands and tiltedit sidewise."Hello!  What's this?"The Arab head-dress I was wearing shifted and showednon-Arab symptoms."Open that bag of mine, will you, Grim, and pass me that big pairof forceps you'll find wrapped in oiled paper on top ofeverything.  There's something I can attend to here at once."It was an uncomfortable moment.  Grim never cracked a smile.  Hedug out the instrument of torture and gave it to Templeton.  Butthere were two points that occurred to me, in addition to theknowledge that nothing whatever was the matter with my ear.Doctors in good standing, who are usually gentlemen, don'toperate without permission;  and the forceps were much too bigfor any such purpose.  So I sat still."Um-m-m!  What he really needs is a red-hot needle run down closeto the ear-drum.  It wouldn't take five minutes, or hurt him--much.  After that I think he'd be able to hear perfectly.Suppose we try.""I can wait ten minutes yet," Grim answered."Very well.  I've a platinum needle in the bag.  I'll get out thespirit-lamp and we'll soon see.  To be candid with you, I don'tbelieve the man's any more deaf than you or I.""If you run a hot needle through the lobe of his ear wellfind out whether he can really talk or not," said Grim inhis pleasantest voice.  "If he's shamming I don't mind.What we need in this service is a man who can endure withoutbetraying himself.""Well, we'll soon see."I began to hate Grim pretty cordially.  I hated him more whenSuliman came in, dressed for the street in a rather dirty cottonsmock, with a turban in place of his fez.  He told the boy tohold the wooden handle of a paper-knife behind my ear to preventthe hot needle from going too far on its sizzling journey.It didn't seem to me the way to reciprocate volunteer secretservice.  Suliman's grin at the prospect of seeing a mantortured was enough to provoke murder.  I brushed the boy aside,fly-fashion, got up, crossed the room, and sat down again inthe corner."Good enough!" laughed Grim.  "You'll do.""Yes, I think he'll do," agreed Templeton.But I took no notice.  I had seen too many games lost and wonwith the last card.  Templeton looked down at Suliman:"Tell him the game's over.  He may talk now.""Mafish mukhkh!" [No brains!] the boy answered, grinning andtapping his own forehead.  "Magnoon!" [Mad!]"I think I can trust them both," said Grim, smiling in mydirection.  "All right, old man;  time out!  If you'd spoken oncethere'd have been nothing more between you and a life of safetyand respectability!""Whereas," said Templeton, "you may now be unsafe and an outlawand enjoy yourself!  Are you sure they haven't marked him?" heasked Grim."Sure!  Why should they suspect a tourist?  But I've takenprecautions.  Word is on the way to the hotel to forward all hismail to Jaffa until further notice."  He laughed at me again.  "Ihope you're not expecting important letters!"Suliman had evidently been well schooled in advance, for at a nodfrom Grim he came over and took my hand, as if I were blind inaddition to the other supposed infirmities.  He led me out by aback-door, across a yard into an alley, which we followed as faras a main road and then turned toward the Jaffa Gate.  Lookingback once I saw Grim in his Shereefian uniform striding alongbehind us;  but where the road forked he took the other turning.There is contentment in walking disguised through crowdedstreets, even when you are in tow of eight-year-old iniquity thatregards you as a lump of baggage to be pushed this and that way.Suliman plainly considered me a rank outsider, only admitted intothe game on sufferance.  Having said I was "magnoon" he lived upto the assertion, and warned people to make way for me if theydid not want to be bitten and go mad, too;  so as a general ruleI received a pretty wide berth.  But it was fun, in spite ofSuliman.  It was like seeing the world through a peep-hole.  Menand women you knew went by without suspecting they wererecognized, and in a puzzling sort of way the world, that hadbeen your world yesterday, seemed now to belong wholly to otherpeople, while you lived in a new sphere of your own.We had to go slowly as we approached the Jaffa Gate, for thecrowd was dense there, and a line of Sikhs was drawn across thegap where the street passes through the city wall.  It was thegap the Turks once made by tearing down the wall to let theKaiser through, when he made that famous meek and humblepilgrimage of his.  The Sikhs were searching all comers forweapons, and we had to wait our turn.Outside the gate, on the left-hand as you faced it, was the usualline of boot-blacks--the only cheap thing left in Jerusalem--amotley two dozen of ex-Turkish soldiers, recently fighting theBritish gamely in the last ditch, and now blacking their bootswith equal gusto, for rather higher pay.  Some of them still woreTurkish uniforms.  Two or three were redheaded and blue-eyed, andalmost certainly descended from Scotch crusaders.  (The wholewide world bears witness that when the Scots went soldiering theywere efficient in more ways than one.)The rest of the crowd were mainly peasantry with basket-loads ofstuff for market;  but there was a liberal sprinkling among themof all the odds and ends of the Levant, with a Jew here andthere, the inevitable Russian priest, and a dozen odd lots,of as many nationalities, whom it would have been difficultto classify.And there was Police Constable Bedreddin Shah.  You could nothave missed noticing him, although I did not learn his name untilafterwards.  He came swaggering down the Jaffa Road with all thebullying arrogance of the newly enlisted Arab policeman.  Heshoved me aside, calling me a name that a drunken donkey-driverwould hesitate to apply to a dog in the gutter.  He was on hisway to the lock-up that stands just inside the gate, and I wishedhim a year in it.As he plunged into the crowd that checked and surged immediatelyin front of the line of Sikhs, a small man in Arab costume withthe lower part of his face well covered by the kaffiyi,* rushedout from the corner behind the bootblacks and drove a long knifehome to the hilt between the policeman's shoulder-blades.  Iwasn't shocked.  I wasn't even sorry. [*Head-dress that hangsdown over the shoulders.]Bedreddin Shah shrieked and fell forward.  Blood gushed from thewound.  The crowd surged in curiously, and then fell back beforethe advancing Sikhs.  A British officer who had heard thevictim's cry came spurring his horse into the crowd from insidethe gate.  In his effort to get near the victim he only added tothe confusion.The murderer, who seemed in no particular hurry, dodged quietlyin and out among the swarm of bewildered peasants, and in thirtyseconds had utterly disappeared.  A minute later I saw Grimoffering his services as interpreter and stooping over the dyingman to try to catch the one word he was struggling to repeat.Chapter Fourteen"Windy bellies without hearts in them."Djemal's coffee shop is run by a Turkish gentleman whose realname is Yussuf.  One name, and the shorter the better, had beenplenty in the days when Djemal Pasha ran Jerusalem with ironruthlessness, and consequent success of a certain sort.  WhenDjemal was the Turkish Governor, every proprietor of every kindof shop had to stand in the doorway at attention whenever Djemalpassed, and woe betide the laggard!It would not have paid any one, in those days, to name any sortof shop after Djemal Pasha.  Even the provider of the rope thatthrottled the offender would have made no profit, because therope would simply have been looted from the nearest store.The hangman would have been the nearest soldier, whose paywas already two years in arrears.  So Yussuf's own name donein Turkish characters used to stand over the door before theBritish came.It was Djemal Pasha's considered judgment that Yussuf cooked thebest coffee in Jerusalem.  So whenever the despot was in the cityhe conferred on Yussuf the inestimable privilege of supplying himwith coffee at odd moments, under threat of the bastinado if thestuff were not suitably sweet and hot.  The only money that everchanged hands in that connection was when the tax-gatherer camedown on Yussuf for an extra levy, because of the added trade thatconceivably might be expected to accrue through the advertisementobtained by serving such an exalted customer.  The tax-gathereralso threatened the bastinado;  and as the man who likes thatpunishment, or who could soften the heart of a Turkish taxassessor, has yet to be discovered, Yussuf invariably paid.But when Allenby conquered Palestine between bouts of trying totame his Australians, and Djemal Pasha scooted hot-foot intoexile with a two-hundred-woman harem packed in lorries at hisrear, Yussuf remembered that old adage about better late thannever.  He put Djemal's name on the stone arch of the narrow doornear the foot of David Street.  He did it partly out of thedisrespect that a small dog feels for a big one that is now onchain;  but he was not overlooking the business value of it.The first result was that he did quite a lot of trade withBritish officers, who came primarily because they were sick ofeating sand and bully-beef, and drinking sand and tepid water inthe desert.  Later they flocked there by way of paying indirecthomage to a governor who, whatever his obvious demerits, had atany rate never been answered back or thwarted with impunity.(There was a time, after the capture of Jerusalem, when if theBritish army could have voted on it, Djemal Pasha would have beenbrought back and given a free hand.)But the officers began to discover that Yussuf was charging themfour or five times the proper price.  The seniors objectedpromptly, and deserted, to the inexpressible delight of thesubalterns;  but even the under-paid extravagant youths grewtired of extortion after a month or two, and Yussuf had to lookelsewhere for customers.Yussuf did some thinking behind that genial Turkish mask of his.Competition was keen.  There are more coffee shops in Jerusalemthan hairs on a hog's back, and the situation, down near thebottom of that narrow thoroughfare in the shadow of an ancientarch, did not lend itself to drawing crowds.But there were others in Jerusalem besides the British officerswho yearned for Djemal's rule again;  and, unlike the irreverentmen in khaki, they did not dare to voice their feelings inpublic.  All the old political grafters, and all the would-be newones savagely resented a regime under which bribery was notpermitted;  and, as always happens sooner or later, they began toshow a tendency to meet in certain places, where they might talkviolence without risk of incurring it.So Yussuf permitted a rumour to gain ground that he, too, was amalcontent and that the British had deserted his coffee shop forthat reason.  He gave out that Djemal Pasha's name over the doorstood for reaction and political intrigue.  So his place began tobe frequented by effendis in tarboosh and semi-European clothes,who could chew the cud of bitterness aloud between walls that thecrusaders had built four feet thick.  The only entrance wasthrough the narrow front door, where Yussuf inspected everyvisitor before admitting him.So Yussuf's "Cafe Djemal Pasha" was the place to go to forpolitics, of the red-hot, death-and-dynamite order that wouldmake Lenin and Trotsky sound like small-town sports.  But firstyou had to get by Yussuf at the door.Suliman led me by the hand down David Street, through the smelly-yelly moil of flies and barter, past the meat and vegetablestalls, beneath the crusader arches from which Jewish womenpeered through trellised windows, across three transversing lanesof the ancient suku,* and halted at Yussuf's door.  [*Bazaar]He rapped on it three times.  When Yussuf's wrinkled faceappeared at last Suliman demanded to see Staff-Captain Ali Mirza.Yussuf's blood-shot eyes peered at me for a long time before heasked a question."Atrash!--akras!--majnoon!!" [Deaf!--Dumb!--Mad!!] said Suliman.Describing me as mad seemed to give him particular delight.  He neveroverlooked a chance of doing it."Staff-Captain Ali Mirza is not here.  What should a Madman wantwith him?""He is not very mad--only stupid.  He carries a message forthe captain.""But the captain is not here.  He has not been here.""He will come.""How should a deaf-and-dumb man deliver a message?""It is in writing.""Very well.  He may leave the writing with me.  If the captaincomes I will deliver it.""No. The message is from Esh-Sham (Damascus).  He will give itonly into the captain's own hand.""What is your name?""Suliman.""What is his?""God knows!  He came with another man by train;  and the otherman, who is much more mad than this one, gave me five piastres tobring this one to your kahwi!"  [Coffe-pot]Yussuf shut the door, and discussed the proposition with hiscustomers.  At the end of two or three minutes his headappeared again."You say Staff-Captain Ali Mirza is expected here?""So said the man at the station.""What do you know of Staff-Captain Ali Mirza?""Nothing."Once more the door closed and I could hear the murmur ofvoices inside--but only a confused murmur, for the door wasthick.  When it opened again two other heads were peeringfrom behind Yussuf's."Has he money?" he asked."Kif?  Ma indi khabar!" [How should I know?]Yussuf opened the door wide and made a sign for me to enter.  Heseemed in two minds whether to let Suliman come in with me ornot, but finally admitted him with a gruff admonition to keepstill in one place and not talk.The place was fairly full.  It was a square room, with one windowhigh in the wall on David Street.  Around three sides, includingthat on which was the front door, ran a wooden seat furnishedwith thin cushions.  Facing the front door was another oneleading to a dark hole in the rear, where pots were washed andrice was boiled;  beside that door, occupying most of the lengthof the fourth wall, was a thing like an altar of dressed stone,on which the coffee was prepared in dozens of little copper pots.The benches being pretty well occupied, I was about to squat downon the floor, but they made room for me close to the front door,so I squatted on the corner of the bench and tucked my legs underme.  Suliman dropped down on the floor in front of me with hishead about level with my knees.The other occupants of the room were all Syrian Arabs--not aBedouin among them.  All of them wore more or less Europeanclothing, with the inevitable tarboosh, each set at a differentangle.  You can guess the mentality of the Syrian by the angle ofthat red Islamic symbol he wears on his head.  The black tasselnormally hangs behind, and the steady-going conservatives and allwho take their religion seriously, wear the inverted flower-pot-shaped affair as nearly straight up as the cranium permits.But once let a Syrian take up new politics, join the Young TurkParty, forswear religion, or grow cynical about accepteddoctrine, and the angle of his tarboosh shows it, just as surelyas the angle of the London Cockney's "bowler" betrays irreverenceand the New York gangster's "lid" expresses self-contemptdisguised as self-esteem.The head-gears were set at every possible angle in that coffee-shop of Yussuf's, from the backward tilt of the breezy optimistto the far-forward thrust down over the eye of malignantcynicism, which usually went with folded arms, legs thrust outstraight, and heels together on the floor.Yussuf brought me coffee without waiting to be asked.  I paid hima half-piastre for it, which is half the proper price, andutterly ignored his expostulation.  He touched me on theshoulder, displayed the coin in the palm of his hand and wentthrough a prodigious pantomime.  I did not even try to appearinterested.  He ordered Suliman to explain to me."Mafish mukhkh!" said the boy, touching his own forehead.My real motive was to act as differently as possible from thewhite man, who always pays twice what he should.  By establishingthe suggestion of accustomed meanness, I hoped to offset anybreaks I might make presently.  Spies, and people of that kind,usually have plenty of money for their needs, so that by actingthe part of a man unused to spending except in minute driblets Istood a better chance of not being detected.But I was in luck.  I have often noticed, so that it has becomealmost an article of creed with me, that luck invariably breaksthat way.  It almost never turns up blind.  You sit down and waitfor luck, and it all goes to the other fellow.  But start to useyour wits, even clumsily, and the luck comes along and squandersitself on you."He is certainly from Damascus," laughed one of the customers."The price is a half-piastre in Damascus at the meaner shops."I did not know anything about Damascus then--had never beenthere;  but from that minute it never entered the mind of one ofthose men to doubt that Damascus was my home-city, so easilysatisfied by trifling suggestions is the unscientific human.Yussuf went back to his charcoal stove grumbling to himselfin Turkish.But there was still one question in doubt.  They seemed satisfiedthat I was really deaf and dumb, but in that land of countlessmission schools and alien speech there is always a chance thateven children know a word or two of French.  They tested Sulimanwith simple questions, such as who was his mother and where washe born;  but he did not need to act that part, he was utterlyignorant of French.So they proceeded to ignore the two of us and turn theirpolitical acrimony loose in French, discussing the maddest, mostunmoral schemes with the gusto of small boys playing pirates.There seemed to be almost as many rival political parties as menin the room.  The only approach to unity was when they agreed toaccuse and destroy.  As for constructive agreement, they hadnone, and every one's suggestion for improvement was sneered atby all the rest.  They were not even agreed about the Zionists,except hating them;  they quarreled about what would be thebest way to take advantage of them before wiping them outof existence.But they all saw exquisite humour in the item of news thatEisernstein had taken so to heart."That was Noureddin Ali's idea!  He is a genius!  To accuse theZionists of offering two million pounds for the Dome of theRock--ah! who else could have thought of it!  The story has spreadall through Jerusalem, and is on its way to the villages.  In twodays it will be common gossip from Damascus to Beersheba.  In aweek it will be known from end to end of Egypt;  then Arabia;then India!  Ho!  When the Indian Moslems get the news--theIndian troops in Palestine will send it by mail--then what afuror!  Then what anger!  That was finesse!  That was truestatesmanship!  Never was a shrewder genius than Noureddin Ali!""Don't shout his name too loud," said somebody.  "TheAdministration suspects him already.""Bah!  Who in this room is a friend of the Administration?  TheAdministrator is a broken shard;  the British will summon himhome for inefficiency.  Besides, there is only one man inJerusalem of whom Noureddin is in the least afraid--that MajorGrim, the American.  And whoever would give the price of a cup ofcoffee for a lease of the life of Major Grim in the circumstanceswould do better to toss the money to the first beggar he meets!""Hssh!""Hah!  All the same, I would not choose to be Noureddin's enemy.""There is another one who will share that opinion--or so I haveheard.  I was told that Bedreddin Shah, a recent recruit in thepolice, stumbled by accident on certain evidence and demanded ahuge sum for silence.  Hee-hee!  How much will anybody giveBedreddin Shah for his prospect?""Hssh!""What did Bedreddin Shah discover?""Nobody knows.""You mean nobody will tell.""The same thing.""How long could a secret be kept in Jerusalem, if you people wereinformed of what is going on?  You are good for propaganda, thatis all!  You can talk--Allah! how you all talk!  But as for doinganything, or keeping a secret until a thing is done, you are nobetter than magpies."The last speaker was a rather fat man, over in the corner by thescullery door.  He had a nose like Sultan Abdul Hamid's andlarge, elongated eyes that looked capable of seeing things oneither side of him while he stared straight forward.  Even inthat dark corner you could see they had the alligator-hue thatone associates with cruelty.  He had the massive shoulders andforward-stooping position as he sat cross-legged on the seat thatsuggest deliberate purpose devoid of hurry.They all resented what he said, but none seemed disposed toquarrel with him.  One or two remonstrated mildly, but he ignoredtheir remarks, busying himself with digging out a cigarette froma gold case set with jewels;  after he had lighted it verythoughtfully and examined the end once or twice to make sure thatit burned just right, he let it hang between his lips in a waythat accentuated the angle of his bulbous nose.  You wonderedwhether he owned a harem, and what the ladies thought of him."Will you sit and brag in here all day?" he asked after a fewminutes.  "Yussuf must be getting rich, you sip so much coffee.It is not particularly good for Yussuf to get rich;  it will makehim lazy, as most of you are."The chattering had ceased, although there were several attemptsto break that uncomfortable silence with inane remarks.  Hisravenish, unpleasant voice seemed to act on the company like achill wind, depriving treason of its warm sociableness butleaving in the sting."I said you are good for propaganda," he resumed, tossing awayash with a reflective air.  "But even that has no value withinfour walls.  If Noureddin Ali should come and learn from me howmuch talking has been done in here, and how little done outside,I can imagine he will not be pleased.  Are there no otherkahawi?*  Why is that story about the Zionists and their offer tobuy the Dome of Rock not being spread diligently?  You like thesafety of this place with its four thick walls.  But I tell youthe jackal has to leave his hole to hunt." [*Coffee-shops]They did not like taking orders, even when they were expressedmore or less indirectly;  no follower of the new politicalfreedom does like it, for it rather upsets the new conceit.  Buthe evidently knew his politicians, and they him.  They got up oneby one and made for the door, each offering a different excusedesigned to cover up obedience under a cloak of snappy independence.Not one of them drew a retort from him, or as much as a farewell nod.When the last one was gone, and the process took up all of half-an-hour, he sat and looked down his nose at me for severalminutes without speaking.  You could have guessed just as easilywhat an alligator was thinking about, and I tried to emulate him,pretending to go off into the brown study that the Turks callkaif, out of which it is considered bad manners to disturb yourbest friend, let alone a stranger.  But manners proved to be nobarrier in his case.He began talking to me in Arabic--directly at me, slowly anddeliberately, but I did not understand very much of it and it wasnot difficult to pretend I did not hear.  However, Suliman was indifferent case;  the boy began to get very restless under themonolog, and I tugged at his back hair more than once to remindhim of the part he had to play.Discovering that the Arabic took no effect on me, the alligatorperson changed to French."They speak French in Damascus.  I know you are not deaf.  Youare a spy.  I know your name.  I know what your business wasbefore you came here.  I know why you want to see the staff-captain.  You have a letter for him;  I know what is in it.   Nouse trying to deceive me;  I have ways of my own of discoveringthings.  Do you know what happens to spies who refuse to answermy questions?  They are attended to.  Quite simple.  They receiveattention.  Nobody hears of them again."There are drains in Jerusalem--big, dark, smelly, ancient, fullof rats--very useful drains.  You think the Staff-Captain AliMirza will protect you.  At a word from me he will make therequest that you receive immediate attention.  You will disappeardown a drain, where even Allah will forget that you ever existed.Staff-Captain Ali Mirza is my old friend.  Better let me seethat letter."I felt like laughing at the drain threats although Suliman wasstill shivering from the effect of the earlier Arabic version.But the statement that he knew the real Ali Mirza might be true,in which case Grim's disguise was not going to last long.However, the fact that he had not yet seen through my disguisewas some comfort.  The wish being father of the thought, Idecided he was bluffing first and last.  But he had not finishedyet.  He tried me in English."The captain will give that letter to me in any case.  It isintended for me.  I have other business now, and wish to savetime, so give it to me at once.  Here, I will give you tenpiastres for it."He pulled out a purse and unfolded a ten-piastre note.  I took nonotice.  He shook it for me to see, and I awoke like a pelican atthe sight of fish."Yours for that letter," he said, shaking it again.I nudged Suliman and nodded to him.  He crossed the room, seizedthe ten-piastre note, and brought it back to me.  I stowed itaway under my shirt."Come, now give me the letter."I took utterly no notice, so he turned his attention to Sulimanagain, and resumed in Arabic."Feel in his pocket and find the letter.""I'm afraid," the boy answered."Of what?  Of him?  I will protect you.  Take the letter fromhim."Suliman chose to play the small boy, as he could very well indeedwhen nothing could be gained by being devilish and ultra-grown-up.  He shook his head and grinned sheepishly."Has he any weapons?" was the next question."Ma indi khabar." [I don't know.]Evidently assault and battery was to be the next item on theprogram.  He had not the eyes or the general air of a man whowill part with ten piastres for nothing.  He called to Yussuf,who came hurrying out of the scullery place.  They held awhispered conference, and Yussuf nodded;  then he came over tothe front door and locked it, removing the key."Tell him to hand over that letter!" he ordered Suliman."Mafish mukhkh!" said the boy, tapping his forehead once more.Suliman's notion was the right one after all--at any rate theonly one available.  Old alligator rolled off his perch andstarted for me.  Yussuf timed his own assault to correspond.They would have landed on me simultaneously, if Suliman had notreminded me that madness is a safe passport nearly anywhere inthe East.So I went stark, raving mad that minute.  I once spent a night inthe room of an epileptic who had delirium tremens, and learned alot from him;  some of it came to mind just when I needed it.  Ifever a man got ten piastres' worth of unexpected side-show it wasthat old Syrian with the alligator eyes.  By the time I was quiteout of breath there wasn't a cushion or a coffee-pot fit forbusiness.  Suliman was standing out of reach on the bench in acorner yelling with laughter, while the two men struggled to getthrough the scullery door, which was too narrow to admit themboth at once.  I earned that ten piastres.  By the same tokenI did not let the kaffiyi fall off my head and betray mywestern origin.Unable to think up any more original motions, and having breathfor none, I sat on the floor and spat repeatedly, having seen amadman do that on the Hebron Road and get feared, if notrespected for it.  There seems to be a theory prevalent in thatpart of the world that the sputum of a madman is contagious.But I overdid it.  Most amateurs do overdo things.They got so afraid that they decided to put me out into thestreet at all costs, where those enemies of society, the police,might demonstrate their ingenuity.  Yussuf made a dash for thefront door, and I suppose he would have called in help and endedmy share in the adventure, if something had not happened.The "something" was Noureddin Ali very much something in hisown opinion."Why didn't you open the door sooner?" he demanded.  "I have beenknocking for two minutes."He watched Yussuf lock the door again behind him, and then eyedthe disheveled room with amused curiosity.  He was a rat-facedlittle man dressed in a black silk jacket, worsted pants andbrown boots, with the inevitable tarboosh set at an angle ofsheer impudence--a man at least fifty years old by the look ofhim, but full of that peppery vigor that so often clings tolittle men in middle life.  On the whole he looked more like aschool-teacher, or a lawyer then a conspirator;  but Yussufaddressed him with great deference as "Noureddin Ali Bey," andeven old alligator-eyes became obsequious.Both Yussuf and the other man began explaining the situation tohim in rapid-fire Arabic.  I, meanwhile, recovering from the fitas fast as I dared and trying to remember how to do it.Noureddin Ali was plainly for having me thrown out, until theymentioned the name of Staff-Captain Ali Mirza;  at that he triedto cross-examine Suliman at great length, but could get nothingout of him.  Suliman had evidently overheard Grim talking aboutNoureddin Ali, and was very much afraid of him."All right," Noureddin Ali said at last.  "No more businesstoday, Yussuf.  Keep the door locked, but admit the captain.  Wemust find out what this message is about."Yussuf went to tidying up the place, while Noureddin Ali and thealligator person talked excitedly in low tones in the corner nearthe scullery door.  I lay on the floor with one eye open,expecting Grim every minute;  but it must have been four in theafternoon before he came, and all that while, with only shortintervals for food and coffee, Noureddin Ali and the other mantalked steadily, discussing over and over again the details ofsome plan.Shortly after midday Suliman began to whimper for food.  Yussufproduced a mess of rice and mutton, of which the two Syrians ateenormously before giving any to the boy;  then they put what wasleft in the dish on the floor in front of me, pretty much in theway you feed a dog, and I hate to remember what I did to it.It is enough that I did not overlook Grim's advice to eatlike a lunatic, and however suspicious of me Noureddin Alimight otherwise have been he was satisfied at the end ofthat performance.Several people tried the door, and some of them made signals onit but Yussuf had a peep-hole where one of the heavy iron nailshad been removed, and after a cautious squint through it at eacharrival he proceeded to ignore them.  One man thundered on thedoor for several minutes, but was allowed to go away without asmuch as a word of explanation.That was the first incident that made me feel quite sureNourreddin Ali was in fear of the police.  All the time thethundering was going on he glanced furtively about him like a ratin a trap.  I saw him feel for a weapon under his arm-pit.  Whenthe noise ceased and the impatient visitor went away he sighedwith relief.  The place was certainly a trap;  there was no backway out of it.When Grim came at last he knocked quietly, and waited in silencewhile Yussuf applied his eye to the nail-hole.  When he entered,the only surprising thing about him seemed to me the thinness ofhis disguise.  In the morning, when I had seen him change in tenminutes from West to East, it had seemed perfect;  but, havinglooked for him so long with the Syrian disguise in mind, itseemed impossible now that any one could be deceived by it.  Hewas at no pains to keep the kaffiyi thing close to his face,and I held my breath, expecting to see Noureddin Ali denouncehim instantly.But nothing of that sort happened.  Grim sat down, thrust hislegs out in front of him, leaned back and called for coffee.  Itwas obvious at once that the alligator person had been lying whenhe boasted of knowing Staff-Captain Ali Mirza, for he made noeffort to claim acquaintance or to denounce him as an impostor.But he nodded to Suliman, and Suliman came over and nudged me.I let the boy go through a lot of pantomimic argument beforeadmitting that I understood, but finally I crossed the room toGrim and offered him the envelope.  He looked surprised, examinedthe outside curiously, spoke to me, shrugged his shoulders when Idid not answer, tossed a question or two to Suliman, shruggedagain and tore the letter open.  Then his face changed, and heglanced to right and left of him as if afraid of being seen.  Hestuffed the letter into his tunic pocket and I went back to thecorner by the front door.Yussuf was pottering about, still rearranging all the pots andfurniture that I had scattered, but his big ears projectedsidewise and suggested that he might have another motive.However, it was a simple matter to evade his curiosity by talkingFrench, and Noureddin All could contain himself no longer."Pardon me, sir?  Staff-Captain Ali Mirza?"Grim nodded suspiciously."I have heard of you.  We have all heard of you.  We are proud tosee you in Jerusalem.  We wish all success to your efforts onbehalf of Mustapha Kemal, the great Turkish Nationalist leader.Our prayer is that he may light such a fire in Anatolia as shallspread in one vast conflagration throughout the East!""Who are you?" asked Grim suspiciously.  (Evidently the real AliMirza had a reputation for gruff manners.)"Noureddin Ali Bey.  It may be you have heard of me.  I am notwithout friends in Damascus.""Oh, are you Noureddin Ali?" Grim's attitude thawed appreciably."We have been looking for more action and less talk from you.  Imade an excuse to visit Jerusalem and discover how much firethere is under this smoke of boasting.""Fire!  Ha-ha!  That is the right word!  There is a camouflage oftalk, but under it--Aha!  You shall see!""Or is that more talk?""We are not all talkers.  Wait and see!""Oh, more waiting?  Has Mustapha Kemal Pasha waited in Anatolia?Has he not set you all an example of deeds without words?  Am Ito wait here indefinitely in Jerusalem to take him news of deedsthat will never happen?""Not indefinitely, my dear captain!  And this time there willreally be a deed that will please even such a rigorous lover ofaction as Mustapha Kemal!"Grim shrugged his shoulders again."I leave for Damascus at dawn," he said cynically.  "I don't careto be mocked there for bringing news of promises.  We have hadtoo many of those barren mares.  I shall say that I have foundeverything here is sterile--the talk abortive--the men mere windybellies without hearts in them!"Chapter Fifteen"I'll have nothing to do with it!"Noureddin Ali was pained and upset.  Grim had pricked hisconceit--had sent thrust home where he kept his susceptibilities.He blinked, peered this and that way, exchanged glances with thealligator person, and then tucked his legs up under him."In me you see a doer!" he announced.  He looked the part.  Hislean, pointed nose and beady little eyes were of the interfering,meddling type.  You could not imagine him, like the yellow-eyedruminant next to him, sitting and waiting ruthlessly for thingsto happen.  Noureddin Ali looked more likely to go out andbe ruthless."So they all say!" Grim retorted."Some one should forewarn them in Damascus what a deed will occurhere presently.  Above all, word should reach Mustapha Kemal, inAnatolia, as soon as possible, so that he may be ready to act.""All day long," said Grim, "I have wandered about Jerusalem,listening to this and that rumour of something that may happen.But I have not found one man who can tell me a fact.""That is because you did not meet me.  I am--hee-hee!  I am thefather of facts.  You say you leave for Damascus at dawn?  Youare positive?  I could tell you facts that would put a sudden endto my career if they were spread about Jerusalem!""That is the usual boast of men who desire credit in the eyes ofthe Nationalist Party," Grim retorted."I see you are skeptical.  That is a wise man's attitude, but Imust be cautious, for my life is at stake.  Now--how do youpropose to leave Jerusalem?  There is no train for Damascus atdawn tomorrow.""I am on a diplomatic mission," answered Grim.  "TheAdministration have placed a car at my disposal to take me as faras the border.""Ah!  And tonight?  Where will you be tonight?""Why?""Because I propose to make a disclosure.  And--ah--hee-hee!--youwould like to live, I take it, and not be sent back to Damascusin a coffin?  I have--ah--some assistants who--hee-hee!--wouldwatch your movements.  If you were to betray me afterwards to theAdministration, there would remain at least--the satisfaction--of--you understand me?--the certainty that you would sufferfor it!"Grim laughed dryly."I shall be at the hotel," he answered.  "In bed.  Asleep.  Thecar comes before dawn.""That is sufficient.  I shall know how to take essentialprecautions.  Now--you think I am a man of words, not deeds?  Youwere near the Jaffa Gate this morning, for I saw you there.  Yousaw a man killed--a policeman, name Bedreddin.  That was anunwise underling, who stumbled by accident on a clue to what Ishall tell you presently.  He had the impudence to try toblackmail me--me, of all people!  You saw him killed.  But didyou see who killed him?  I--I killed him, with this right hand!You do not believe?  You think, perhaps, I lack the strength forsuch a blow?  Look here, where the force of it broke my skin onthe handle of the knife!  Now, am I a man of words, not deeds?""You want me to report to Mustapha Kemal that all theaccomplishment in Jerusalem amounts to one policeman killed?""No, no!  You mistake my meaning.  My point is that having provedto you I am a ruthless man of action, I am entitled to bebelieved when I tell you what next I intend to do.""Well--I  listen.""There is going to be--hee-hee!--an explosion!""Where?  When?  Of what?""In Jerusalem, within a day or two, and of what?  Why, of highexplosive, what else?""Much good an explosion in this city will do Mustapha Kemal!"Grim grumbled.  "You may kill a few beggars and break somewindows.  The British will double the guards afterward at all thecity gates, and that will be the end of it;  except that some ofyou, who perhaps may escape being thrown into jail, will apply toMustapha Kemal for high commissions in his army on the strengthof it!  Great doings!  Mustapha Kemal will have no bastinadoed.""Hee-hee!  You are going to be surprised.  What would you say toan explosion, for instance, that destroyed the Dome of the Rock?""That might accomplish results.""Hee-hee!  You admit it!  An explosion to be blamed on theZionists, who must afterward be protected by the British from themob!  Would that not set India on fire?""It might help.  But who is to do it?""You see the doer before you!  I will do it.""If I thought such a thing was really going to take place--""You would think that news worth carrying, eh?  You would hurryto Damascus, wouldn't you?  And let me assure you, my dearcaptain, speed is essential.  There are reasons why the explosionhas not yet occurred--reasons of detail and difficulties to beovercome.  But now there is little further prospect of delay.Everything is nearly ready.  The explosive is not yet in place,but is at hand.  The authorities suspect nothing.  There remainsonly a little excavation work, and then--hee-hee!--nothing to dobut choose the hour when hundreds are in the mosque.  Houp-la!Up she goes.  Does not the idea appeal to you?""Sensational--very," Grim admitted."Ah!  But the utmost must be made of the sensation.  Men must beready in Damascus to stir public feeling on the strength of it.Word must go to Mustapha Kemal to strike hard while the iron ishot.  There must be reprisals everywhere.  Blood must flow."The Europeans, French as well as British, must be goaded intomaking rash mistakes that will further inflame the populace.  Itmust be shouted from the house-tops that the Jews have blown up aMoslem sacred place, and that the British are protecting them.There must be a true jihad* proclaimed against all non-Moslemsalmost simultaneously everywhere.  Do you understand now howswiftly you must travel to Damascus?" [*Holy war.]Grim nodded.  "Yet these foreigners are cunning," he saiddoubtfully.  "Are you sure your plan is not suspected?""Quite sure.  There was one man--a cursed interfering jackanapesof an American, whom they all call Jimgrim, of whom I was afraid.He is clever.  He goes snooping here and there, and knows how todisguise himself.  But he fell downstairs this morning and brokehis thigh in two places.  If anything could make me religious,that would!  If I were not a nationalist, I would say 'Gloryto God, and blessed be His Prophet, who has smitten him whomwe feared!"'"That broken leg might be a trick to put you off your guard,"Grim suggested pleasantly."No.  I made secret enquiries.  He is in great pain.  He may losethe leg.  The doctor who has charge of the case is a MajorTempleton, an irritable person and, like most of the English, toobig a fool to deceive anybody.  No, luckily for Mister Jimgrim itis not a trick.  Otherwise he would have shared the fate today ofBedreddin Shah the constable.  The trap was all ready for him.With the inquisitive and really clever out of the way there isnothing to be feared.  Now--pardon me, Captain Ali Mirza, butthat letter you received just now;  would you like to show itto me?""Why?" Grim demanded, frowning, and bridling all over."Hee-hee!  For the sake of reciprocity.  I have told you mysecret.  If it were not that I am more than usually circumspect,and accustomed to protect myself, one might say that my life isnow in your hands, captain.  Besides--hee-hee!--I might add thatJerusalem is my particular domain.  I would have no difficulty inseeing that letter in any case.  But there should be no need for--hee-hee!--shall we call them measures?--between friends.""I see you are a man of resource," said Grim."Of great resource, with picked lieutenants.  May I see theletter now?"Grim produced it.  Noureddin Ali took it between spidery fingersand examined it like a schoolmaster conning a boy's composition.But the expression of his face changed as he took in thecontents, holding the paper so that alligator-eyes could readit, too."Who wrote this?" he asked."Can't you read the signature?  Enver Eyub.""Who is he?""One of Mustapha Kemal's staff.""So.  'In pursuing your mission you will also take steps toascertain whether or not Noureddin Ali Bey is a person worthy ofconfidence.'  Aha!  That is excellent!  So Mustapha Kemal Pashahas heard of me?"Grim nodded."And the rest of your mission?""Is confidential.""And are you satisfied that I am to be trusted?""I think you mean business.""Then you should tell me what is the nature of your secretmission to Jerusalem.  Possibly I can give you needed information.If you have obtained information of value, you should confide inme.  I can be most useful when I know most."Grim frowned.  He began to look uneasy.  And the more he did that,the more delight Noureddin Ali seemed to take in questioning him,but be pleaded his own case, too."The trouble with the Nationalist movement," he insisted, "islack of unity.  There is no mutual confidence--consequently nocombination.  There are too many intellects working at crosspurposes.  You should tell me what is being done, so that I mayfit in my plans accordingly.  When the Dome of the Rock has beenblown up there will be ample opportunity for putting intoexecution a combined plan.  You must confide in me.""Suppose I get rid of that messenger and the boy first,"Grim suggested.Grim felt in his pocket and produced a purse full of bank notes.But they were all big ones."Never mind, I have change," said Noureddin Ali.  "How much willyou give him?""No," said Grim.  "The boy can take him to the hotel.  Let himwait for me there.  He has no further business here.  He shouldreturn to Damascus.  He had better travel with me in the cartomorrow morning.  Take him to the hotel, and wait for me there,you," he added in Arabic to Suliman.Yussuf came and opened the door.  Suliman took my hand and led meout.  The door slammed shut behind me, and a great Sikh, leaningon his rifle at a corner thirty feet away, came to life justsufficiently to follow me up-street with curious brown eyes."That is Narayan Singh," announced Suliman when we had passedhim.  "He is Jimgrim's friend."There was another Sikh just in sight of him at the next corner,and another beyond him again, all looking rather bored butawfully capable.  None except the first one took the slightestnotice of us.It was some consolation to know that "Jimgrim's friend" was onguard outside Yussuf's.  I had no means of knowing what weaponsGrim carried, if any, but was positive of one thing:  if eitherNoureddin Ali or the man with alligator eyes should get aninkling of his real identity his life would not be worth tenminutes' purchase.  Including Yussuf, who would likely do as hewas told, there would be three to one between those silent walls,and it seemed to me that Narayan Singh might as well be threemiles away as thirty feet.  However, there was nothing I could doabout it.It was late afternoon already, and the crowd was swarming all oneway, the women carrying the baskets and the men lording it nearenough to keep an eye on them.  If Suliman and I were followed,whoever had that job had his work cut out, for we were swallowedup in a noisy stream of home-going villagers, whose baskets andother burdens made an effectual screen behind us as well asin front.The hotel stands close by the Jaffa Gate, and there the crowd wasdensest, for the outgoing swarm was met by another tide, of city-folk returning.  In the mouth of the hotel arcade stood anofficer whom I knew well enough by sight--Colonel Goodenough,commander of the Sikhs, a quiet, gray little man with a monocle,and that air of knowing his own mind that is the real key tocontrol of Indian troops.  Up a side-street there were a dozentroop-horses standing, and a British subaltern was making himselfas inconspicuous as he could in the doorway of a store.  It didnot need much discernment to judge that those in authority wereready to deal swiftly with any kind of trouble.But the only glimpse I had of any mob-spirit stirring was whenthree obvious Zionist Jews were rather roughly hustled by someHebron men, who pride themselves on their willingness to brawlwith any one.  Two Sikhs interfered at once, and Goodenough, whowas watching, never batted an eyelash.I was tired, wanted a whiskey and soda and a bath more thananything else I could imagine at the moment.  I was eager to getto my room in the hotel.  Suliman, being not much more than ababy after all, wanted to go to sleep.  We went past Goodenough,who eyed me sharply but took no further notice, and we enteredthe hotel door.  But there we were met by Cerberus in the shapeof an Arab porter, who cursed our religion and ordered us outagain, threatening violence if we did not make haste.Suliman argued with him in vain, and even whimpered.  There wasnothing for it but to return to the arcade, where I sat down on astep, from which a native policeman drove me away officiously.  Ihad about made up my mind to go and speak to Goodenough inEnglish, when Grim appeared.  Not even Goodenough recognized him,his Syrian stride was so well acted.  He saluted, and the salutewas returned punctiliously but with that reserve toward aforeigner that the Englishman puts on unconsciously.  When Grimspoke to him in Arabic Goodenough answered in the same language.I did not hear what was said at first, but as I drew closer Iheard the sequel, for Grim changed suddenly to English."If you can't recognize me through that magnifying-glass ofyours, colonel, I must be one leopard who can really change hisspots.  I'm Grim.  Don't change your expression.  Quick:  lookaround and tell me if I'm followed.""Hard to say.  Such a crowd here.  There's a Syrian over the waywith a bulbous nose, who came along after you;  he's leaning withhis back to the wall now, watching us.""He's the boy.""I see Narayan Singh has left his post.  Did you givehim orders?""Yes.  Told him to follow any one who followed me.  I don't wantthat fellow interfered with.  He may stay there, or more likelyhe'll call others to take his place;  they'll watch all night, ifthey're allowed to;  let them.  Wish you'd give orders they're tobe left alone.  Then, please let Narayan Singh go off duty andget some sleep;  I'm going to want him all day tomorrow.""All right, Grim;  anything else?""First opportunity, I wish you'd come to Davey's room upstairs.Now--long distance stuff again, sir--if any Syrian asks you aboutme, you might say I was making sure the car would come for meat dawn."They exchanged salutes again as one suspicious alien to another.Grim looked suitably surprised at sight of me, and led me andSuliman back to the hotel, where Suliman wanted him to wreak direvengeance on the porter;  he grew sulky when he discovered thathis influence with Grim was not sufficient for the purpose, butforgot it, small boy fashion, ten minutes later, when he fellasleep on the floor in a corner of Davey's room.Davey did not look exactly pleased to see us, although he seemedto like Grim personally, and was the first that day to seethrough Grim's disguise at the first glance.  Mrs. Davey, on theother hand, was radiant with smiles--thrilled at the prospect oflearning secrets.  She produced drinks and pushed the armchairsup.  When she learned who I was, her husband could hardly keepher from putting on a costume too, to make a party of it.Davey was reserved.  He asked no questions.  A gray-headed, gray-eyed, stocky, sturdy-looking man, who had made impossibilitiescome true on three continents, he waited for trouble to come tohim instead of seeking it.  There was silence for several minutesover the cigars and whiskey before Grim opened fire at last.  Hetalked straight out in front of Mrs. Davey, for she had motheredCosmopolitan Oil men in a hundred out-of-the-way places.  Sheknew more sacred secrets than the Sphinx."Any news about your oil concessions, Davey?""No.  Not a word.  We've got every prospect in the country markedout.  Nothing to do now but wait for the mandate, while theZionists go behind our backs to the Foreign Office and scheme forthe concessions.  It's my belief the British mean to favor theZionists and put us in the ditch.  The fact that we were first onthe ground, and lodged our applications with the Turks before thewar seems to make no difference in their lives.""Well, old man, I've arranged for you to change your policy,"said Grim."What in thunder do you mean?"Mrs. Davey giggled with delight, but her husbandfrowned ominously."I'm supposed to be Staff-Captain Ali Mirza of theShereefian army.""I've heard of him.  He's a bad one, Jim.  He is one of thoseSyrian Arabs who will accept any one's money, but who never staysbought.  Why masquerade as a scoundrel?""I was in a place just now with a bunch of murderers, who'd havemade short work of me if I couldn't give them a sound reason forbeing in Jerusalem just now.""Why not have 'em all arrested?""For the same reason, Davey, that your Oil Company isn't pipingten thousand barrels a day from Jericho.  The time is not yet.Things haven't reached that stage.  I told them your Oil Companygave up hope long ago of getting a concession from the British,and has decided to finance Mustapha Kemal."Davey flung his cigar out of the window, and laid both hands onhis knees.  His face was a picture of baffled indignation.  Buthis wife laughed."They were tickled to death," Grim continued.  "I'm supposed tobe going to Damascus tomorrow morning with a hundred thousanddollars in U.S. gold, obtained from you in ten small bags.  We'vegot to find some bags and pack them full of something heavy.""I'll have nothing to do with it!" Davey exploded at last.  "It'sa damned outrage!  Why--this tale will be all over the place.The Jews will get hold of it, and make complaints in London.Next you know, the U.S. State Department will be raising bluehell.  Questions asked in Congress.  Headlines in all the papers!What do you suppose our people will think of me?""Refer them to your wife, Davey.  She's got you out of muchworse messes.""I'll drive the car straight up to OETA and lodge my protestagainst this in less than fifteen minutes!""No need;  Davey, old man.  Goodenough will be in here presently.Kick to him."Mrs. Davey went into the next room and returned with a roll ofcoarse cotton cloth."I've no bags, Jim, but if this stuff will do I can sew someright now.""Good enough, Emily, go to it.""D'you want to lose me my job?" demanded Davey.  But his wifetook up the scissors and smiled back at him."You know better than that.  We've trusted Jim before.""Listen, Davey;  this thing's serious," said Grim."I know it is!  So'm I!  Nothing doing!""You're on the inside of an official secret.""Curse all official secrets!  My business is oil!""There'll be no oil in this man's land for any one for fiftyyears if you won't play.  There'll be a jihad instead.  They'replanning to blow up the Dome of the Rock.""Jee-rusalem!""Straight goods, Davey.  Two tons of TNT stolen, and our friendScharnhoff, the Austrian, hunting for the Tomb of the Kings--digging for it day and night--conspirators waiting to run in theexplosive as soon as the tunnel is complete.""Why not arrest 'em at once?""We want to catch the principals red-handed, explosive and all.We don't know where the explosive is yet.  Bag the lot, and killthe story.  Otherwise, d'you see what it means, if the news leaksout?  They'll blame the attempt on the Jews.  And the minute theBritish protect the Jews there'll be all Moslem Asia on fire.Get me?""Get you?  Yes, I get you.  I'll get hell from the home office,though, for meddling in politics."Goodenough came in then, rather a different man from the sternlittle martinet who had stood in the throat of the arcade.  Hewas all smiles."Evening, Mrs. Davey," he said genially.  "That one man wentaway, Grim, and three took his place.  They shan't be disturbed.Narayan Singh has gone off duty.  Now, Mrs. Davey, I've been toldthat Americans all went dry, on account of a new religion calledthe Volstead Act.  D'you mean to say you'd tempt a thirstysoldier with a dry martini?"Chapter Sixteen"The Enemy is nearly always useful if you leave him free tomake mistakes."The next item on the program was to awaken Suliman.  He did notwant to wake up.  He had lost all interest in secret service forthe time being.  Even the sight of Mrs. Davey's New York candydid not stir enthusiasm;  he declared it was stuff fit forbints,* not men.   [*Women]"All right then," Grim announced at last."School for you, and I'll get another side-partner."That settled it.  The boy, on whose lips the word dog was a foulepithet, was actually proud to share a packing-case bedroom withJulius Caesar the mess bull-dog.  School, where there would beother iniquitous small boys to be led into trouble, had noparticular terrors.  But to lose his job and to see another boy,perhaps a Jew or a Christian, become Jimgrim's Jack-of-all-jobswas outside the pale of inflictions that pride could tolerate."I am awake!" he retorted, rubbing his eyes to prove it."Come here, then.  D'you know where to find your mother?""At the place where I went yesterday.""Take her some of Mrs. Davey's candy.  Don't eat it on the way,mind.  Get inside the place if you can.  If she won't let you intry how much you can see through the door.  Ask no questions.  Ifshe asks what you've been doing, tell her the truth:  say thatyou cleaned my boots and washed Julius Caesar.  Then come backhere and tell me all you've seen.""Sending him to spy on his own mother, Jim?" asked Mrs. Davey asSuliman left the room with candy in both fists.  She paused fromstitching at the cotton bags to look straight at Grim."His mother is old Scharnhoff's housekeeper," Grim answered."Scharnhoff wouldn't stand for the boy, and drove him out.  Themother liked Scharnhoff's flesh-pots better than the prospects ofthe streets, so she stayed on, swiping stuff from Scharnhoff'slarder now and then to slip to the kid through the back door.But he was starving when I found him."Mrs. Davey laid her sewing down."D'you  mean to tell me that that old butter-wouldn't-melt-in-his-mouth professor is that child's father?""No.  The father was a Turkish soldier--went away with theTurkish retreat.  If he's alive he's probably with Mustapha Kemalin Anatolia.  Old Scharnhoff used to keep a regular harem underthe Turks.  He got rid of them to save his face when our crowdtook Jerusalem.  He puts up with one now.  But he has thethorough-going Turk's idea of married life.""And to think I had him here to tea--twice--no, three times!  Iliked him, too!  Found him interesting.""He is," said Grim."Very!" agreed Goodenough."If it weren't for that harem habit of his," said Grim, "someacquaintances of his would have blown up the Dome of the Rockabout this time tomorrow.  As it is, they won't get away withit.  Suliman came and told me one day that his mother wascarrying food to Scharnhoff, taking it to a little house ina street that runs below the Haram-es-Sheriff.  I looked intothat.  Then came news that two tons of TNT was missing, on topof a request from Scharnhoff for permission to go about at nightunquestioned.  After that it was only a question of puttingtwo and two together--""Plus Narayan Singh," said Goodenough.  "I still don't see, Grim,how you arrived at the conclusion that Scharnhoff is not guiltyof the main intention.  What's to prove that he isn't in the payof Mustapha Kemal?""I'll explain.  All Scharnhoff cares about is some manuscripts hethinks he'll find.  He thinks he knows where they are.  TheChronicles of the Kings of Israel.  I expect he tried pretty hardto get the Turks to let him excavate for them.  But the Turksknew better than to offend religious prejudices.  And perhapsScharnhoff couldn't afford to bribe heavily enough;  his haremvery likely kept him rather short of money.  Then we come along,and stop all excavation--cancel all permits--refuse to grantnew ones."Scharnhoff's problem is to dig without calling attention to whathe's doing.  As a technical enemy alien he can't acquireproperty, or even rent property without permission.  But with theaid of Suliman's mother he made the acquaintance of our friendNoureddin Ali, who has a friend, who in turn has a brother, whoowns a little house in that street below the Haram-es-Sheriff.""Strange coincidence!" said Goodenough.  "It'll need a betterargument than that to save Scharnhoff's neck.""Pardon me, sir.  No coincidence at all.  Remember, Scharnhoffhas lived in Jerusalem for fifteen years.  He seems to havesatisfied himself that the Tomb of the Kings is directly underthe Dome of the Rock.  How is he to get to it?  The Dome of theRock stands in the middle of that great courtyard, with thebuildings of the Haram-es-Sheriff surrounding it on everyside, and hardly a stone in the foundations weighing less thanten tons."He reasons it out that there must be a tunnel somewhere, leadingto the tomb, if it really is under the Dome of the Rock.  I havefound out that he went to work, while the Turks were still here,to find the mouth of the tunnel.  Remember, he's an archaeologist.There's very little he doesn't know about Jerusalem.  He knowswho the owner is of every bit of property surrounding theHaram-es-Sheriff;  he's made it his business to find out.  Sowhen he finally decided that this little stone house stands overthe mouth of the tunnel, all that remained to do was to getaccess to it.  He couldn't do that himself, because of theregulations.  He had to approach the Arab owner secretly andindirectly.  That's where Suliman's mother came in handy."She contrived the introduction to Noureddin Ali.  Innocent oldScharnhoff, who is an honest thief--he wouldn't steal money--sacrilege is Scharnhoff's passion--was an easy mark for NoureddinAli.  Noureddin Ali is a red-minded devil, so smart at seeingpossibilities that he is blind to probabilities.  He is paid bythe French to make trouble, and he's the world's long-distancedouble-crosser.  I don't believe the French have any hand in thisjob.  Scharnhoff needed explosives.  Noureddin Ali saw at oncethat if that tunnel can be found and opened up there could bean atrocity perpetrated that would produce anarchy all throughthe East.""As bad as all that?" asked Mrs.  Davey."That's no exaggeration," Goodenough answered.  "I've livedtwenty-five years in India, commanding Sikh and Moslem troops.The Sikhs are not interested in the Moslem religion in any way,but they'd make common cause with Moslems if that place wereblown up and the blame could be attached to Jews.  It's thesecond most sacred place in Asia.  Even the Hindus would bestirred to their depths by it;  they'd feel that their own sacredplaces were insecure, and that whoever destroyed them would beprotected afterwards by us.""Gosh!  Who'd be an Englishman!" laughed Davey."I don't see that it's proved yet that the idea of an explosionwasn't Sharnhoff's in the first place," Goodenough objected."For one thing, he wouldn't want to destroy antiquities," saidGrim.  "They're his obsession.  He worships ancient history andall its monuments.  No, Noureddin Ali thought of the explosion.He knew that Scharnhoff needed money, so he gave him Frenchmoney, knowing that would put old Scharnhoff completely in hispower.  Then he tipped off some one down at Ludd to watch for achance to steal some TNT.  He had better luck than he expected.He got two tons of it.  He didn't have all the luck, though.His plan, I believe, was to time the fireworks simultaneouslywith a French-instigated raid from El-Kerak.  But the raiddidn't come off.""Scharnhoff will hang!" said Goodenough."I think not, sir.  He'll prove as meek as an old sheep when weland on him.""There, will the bags do?" asked Mrs. Davey."What are they for?" Goodenough asked."We're supposed to have a slush fund in this room of a hundredthousand dollars," Davey answered dourly.  "My Oil Company issupposed to be buying up Mustapha Kemal!  I see my finish, ifnews of this ever reaches the States--or unless my version of itgets there first!"Grim turned to me."We've got to find two people to take your place and mine in thecar tomorrow morning.  Perhaps you'd better go in any case;you'll enjoy the ride as far as Haifa--stay there a day or two,and come back when you feel like it.  We'll find some officer tomasquerade as me."But there I rebelled--flat, downright mutiny."If I haven't made good so far," I said, "I'll consider myselffired, and hold my tongue.  Otherwise, I see this thing through!Send some one else on the joy-ride.""Good for you!" said Davey."Dammit, man!" said Goodenough, staring at me through hismonocle.  "The rest of us get paid for taking chances.  The onlytangible reward you can possibly get will be a knife in yourback.  Better be sensible and take the ride to Haifa.""My bet is down," said I."Good," Grim nodded.  "It goes.  All the same, you get a joy-ride.  Can't take too many chances.  Tell you about that later.Meanwhile, will you detail an officer to come and spend the nightin this hotel and masquerade as me at dawn, sir?  He can wearthis uniform that I've got on--somebody about my height.""Turner will do that.  What are you going to put in the bags?"asked Goodenough."Cartridges.  They're heavy.  You might tell Turner over thephone to bring them with him."At that point Suliman returned, sooner than expected, with newsthat made Grim whistle.  Suliman had not been inside the placewhere his mother was.  She would not let him.  But he had seenaround her skirts as she stood in the partly opened door."There was a hole in the floor," said Suliman, "and a great stonelaid beside it.  Also much gray dust.  And I think there was alight a long way down in the hole."But that was not what made Grim whistle."What else?  Did your mother say anything?""She was ill-tempered.""That Scharnhoff had beaten her.""I knew he'd make a bad break sooner or later.  What did he beather for?""Because she was afraid.""That's a fine reason.  Afraid of what?""He says she is to sell oranges.  Four wooden benches have beenbrought, and tomorrow they are to be set outside the door in thestreet.  Oranges and raisins have been bought, and she is to sitoutside the door and sell them.  She is afraid.""Fruit bought already?  Can't be.  Was it inside there?""No.  It is to come tomorrow.  She says she does not know how tosell fruit, and is afraid of the police."Grim and Goodenough exchanged glances."She says that if the police come everybody will be killed, andthat I am to keep watch in the street in the morning and givewarning of the police.""That should teach you, young man, never to take a woman intoyour confidence--eh, Mrs. Davey?" said Goodenough."We're certainly the slow-witted sex," she answered, piling thefinished bags one on top of the other on the table.Grim took me after that to the hotel roof, whence you can see thewhole of Jerusalem.  It was just before moonrise.  The ancientcity lay in shadow, with the Dome of the Rock looming above it,mysterious and silent.  Down below us in the street, where agasoline light threw a greenish-white glare, three Arabs innative costume were squatting with their backs against the lowwall facing the hotel."Noureddin Ali's men," said Grim, chuckling.  "They'll help us toprove our alibi.  The enemy is nearly always useful if you leavehim free to make mistakes.  You may have to spend the whole nightin the mosque--you and Suliman.  I'll take you there presently.Two of those men are pretty sure to follow us.  One will probablyfollow me back here again.  The other will stay to keep an eye onyou.  About an hour before dawn, in case nothing happens beforethat, you and Suliman come back here to the hotel.  The car shallbe here half-an-hour before daylight.  You and Turner pile intoit, and those three men watch you drive away.  They'll hurry offto tell Noureddin Ali that Staff-Captain Ali Mirza and thedeaf-and-dumb man have really started for Damascus, bags of goldand all."Turner must remember to drop a couple of bags and pick them upagain, to call attention to them.  There'll be a change ofclothes in the car for you.  When you've gone a mile or so, getinto the other clothes and walk back.  If I don't meet you by theJaffa Gate, Suliman will, or else Narayan Singh.  Things areliable to happen pretty fast tomorrow morning.  Let's go."I'm supposed to have found out somehow that you're awfulreligious and want to pray, so it's the Dome of the Rock foryours.  Any Moslem who wants to may sleep there, you know.  Butany Christian caught kidding them he's a Moslem would be for it--short shrift.  He'd be dead before the sheikh of the place couldhand him over to the authorities.  If the TNT were really inplace underneath you, which I'm pretty sure it won't be for a fewhours yet, that would be lots safer than the other chance you'retaking.  So peel your wits.  Let Suliman sleep if he wants to,but you'll have to keep awake all night.""But what am I to do in there?  What's likely to happen?""Just listen.  The tunnel isn't through to the end yet, I'm sureof it.  If it were, they'd have taken in the TNT, for it must beticklish work keeping it hidden elsewhere, with scores of Sikhswatching day and night.  But they're very near the end of thetunnel, or they wouldn't be opening up that fruit stand.  You'llhear them break through.  When you're absolutely sure of that,come out of the mosque and say Atcha--just that one word--to theSikh sentry you'll see standing under the archway through whichwe'll enter the courtyard presently.  That sentry will be NarayanSingh, and he'll know what to do.""What shall I do after that?""Suit yourself.  Either return to the mosque and go to sleep, ifyou can trust yourself to wake in time, or come and sit on thehotel step until morning.  Have you got it all clear?  It's apiece of good luck having you to do all this.  No real Moslemwould ever be able to hold his tongue about it.  They'resuperstitious about the Dome of the Rock.  But ask questions now,if you're not clear;  you mustn't be seen speaking in the streetor in the mosque, remember.  All plain sailing?  Come along,then.  If you're alive tomorrow you'll have had an adventure."Chapter Seventeen"Poor old Scharnhoff's in the soup."We ate a scratch dinner with the Daveys in their room and startedforth.  Grim as usual had his nerve with him.  He led me andSuliman straight up to the three spies who were squatting againstthe wall, and asked whether there were any special regulationsthat would prevent my being left for the night in the famousmosque.  On top of that he asked one of the men to show him theshortest way.  So two of them elected to come with us, walkingjust ahead, and the third man stayed where he was, presumably incase Noureddin Ali should send to make enquiries.You must walk through Jerusalem by night, with the moon justrising, if you want really to get the glamour of eastern talesand understand how true to life those stories are of old Haroun-al-Raschid.  It is almost the only city left with its ancientwalls all standing, with its ancient streets intact.  At thattime, in 1920, there was nothing whatever new to mar the setting.No new buildings.  The city was only cleaner than it was underthe Turks.Parts of the narrow thoroughfares are roofed over with vaultedarches.  The domed roofs rise in unplanned, beautiful disorderagainst a sky luminous with jewels.  To right and left you canlook through key-hole arches down shadowy, narrow ways to carveddoors through which Knights Templar used to swagger with goldspurs, and that Saladin's men appropriated after them.Yellow lamplight, shining from small windows set deep in themassive walls, casts an occasional band of pure gold across thestoried gloom.  Now and then a man steps out from a doorway, hisidentity concealed by flowing eastern finery, pauses for amoment in the light to look about him, and disappears intosilent mystery.Half-open doors at intervals give glimpses of white interiors,and of men from a hundred deserts sitting on mats to smoke greatwater-pipes and talk intrigue.  There are smells that arestagnant with the rot of time;  other smells pungent withspice, and mystery, and the alluring scent of bales ofmerchandise that, like the mew of gulls, can set the mindtraveling to lands unseen.Through other arched doors, even at night, there is a glimpse ofblindfold camels going round and round in ancient gloom at theoil-press.  There are no sounds of revelry.  The Arab takes hispleasures stately fashion, and the Jew has learned from historythat the safest way to enjoy life is to keep quiet about it.  Nowand then you can hear an Arab singing a desert song, not verymusical but utterly descriptive of the life he leads.  Wecaught the sound of a flute played wistfully in an upper roomby some Jew returned from the West to take up anew the threadof ancient history.Grim nudged me sharply in one shadowy place, where the streetwent down in twenty-foot-long steps between the high walls ofwindowless harems.  Another narrow street crossed ours thirtyfeet ahead of us, and our two guides were hurrying, only glancingback at intervals to make sure we had not given them the slip.The cross-street was between us and them, and as Grim nudged metwo men--a bulky, bearded big one and one of rather less thanmiddle height, both in Arab dress--passed in front of us.  Therewas no chance of being overheard, and Grim spoke in a low voice:"Do you recognize them?" "I shook my head."Scharnhoff and Noureddin Ali!"I don't see now how he recognized them.  But I suppose a man whoworks long enough at Grim's business acquires a sixth sense.They were walking swiftly, arguing in low tones, much too busywith their own affairs to pay attention to us.  Our two guidesglanced back a moment later, but they had vanished by then intothe gloom of the cross-street.There was a dim lamp at one corner of that crossing.  As wepassed through its pale circle of light I noticed a man wholooked like an Arab lurking in the shadow just beyond it.  Ithought he made a sign to Grim, but I did not see Grim return it.Grim watched his chance, then spoke again:"That man in the shadow is a Sikh--Narayan Singh's sidekick--keeping tabs on Scharnhoff.  I'll bet old Scharnhoff has coldfeet and went to find Noureddin Ali to try and talk him out ofit.  Might as well try to pretty-pussy a bob-cat away from a hen-yard!  Poor old Scharnhoff's in the soup!"Quite suddenly after that we reached a fairly wide street and thearched Byzantine gateway of the Haram-es-Sheriff, through whichwe could see tall cypress trees against the moonlit sky and thedome of the mosque beyond them.  They do say the Taj Mahal atAgra is a lovelier sight, and more inspiring;  but perhaps thatis because the Taj is farther away from the folk who like to haveopinions at second-hand.  Age, history, situation, setting,sanctity--the Dome of the Rock has the advantage of all those,and the purple sky, crowded with coloured stars beyond it is morewonderful over Jerusalem, because of the clearness of themountain air.In that minute, and for the first time, I hated the menwho could plot to blow up that place.  Hitherto I had beenmerely interested.Because it was long after the hour when non-Moslem visitors areallowed to go about the place with guides, we were submitted torather careful scrutiny by men who came out of the shadows andsaid nothing, but peered into our faces.  They did not speak tolet us by, but signified admittance by turning uninterested backsand retiring to some dark corners to resume the vigil.  I thoughtthat the Sikh sentry, who stood with bayonet fixed outside thearch, looked at Grim with something more than curiosity, but nosign that I could detect passed between them.The great white moonlit courtyard was empty.  Not a soul stirredin it.  Not a shadow moved.  Because of the hour there were noteven any guides lurking around the mosque.  The only shape thatcame to life as we approached the main entrance of the mosque wasthe man who takes care of the slippers for a small fee.Grim, since he was in military dress, allowed the attendant totie on over his shoes the great straw slippers they keep therefor that purpose.  Suliman had nothing on his feet.  I kicked offthe red Damascus slippers I was wearing, and we entered theoctagonal building by passing under a curtain at the rear of thedeep, vaulted entrance.Nobody took any notice of us at first.  It was difficult to see,for one thing;  the light of the lamps that hung on chains fromthe arches overhead was dimmed by coloured lenses and did littlemore than beautify the gloom.  But in the dimness in the midstyou could see the rock of Abraham, surrounded by a railing topreserve it from profane feet.  Little by little the shadows tookshape of men praying, or sleeping, or conversing in low tones.The place was not crowded.  There were perhaps a hundred men inthere, some of whom doubtless intended to spend the night.  Allof them, though they gave us a cursory glance, seemed disposed tomind their own business.  It looked for a minute as if we weregoing to remain in there unquestioned.  But the two spies who hadcome with us saw a chance to confirm or else disprove our bonafides, and while one of them stayed and watched us the other wentto fetch the Sheikh of the Mosque.He came presently, waddling very actively for such a stout man--abig, burly, gray-bearded intellectual, with eyes that beamedintelligent good-humour through gold-rimmed glasses.  He did notseem at all pleased to have been disturbed, until he drew nearenough to scan our faces.  Then his change of expression, as soonas he had looked once into Grim's eyes, gave me cold chills alldown the back.  I could have sworn he was going to denounce us.Instead, he turned on the two spies.  He tongue-lashed them inArabic.  I could not follow it word for word.  I gathered thatthey had hinted some suspicion as to the genuineness of Grim'spretension to be Staff-Captain Ali Mirza.  He was rebuking themfor it.  They slunk away.  One went and sat near the door we hadentered by.  The other vanished completely."Jimgrim!  What do you do here at this hour?" asked the sheikh assoon as we stood alone."Talk French," Grim answered.  "We can't afford to be overheard.""True, O Jimgrim!  It is all your life and my position is worthfor you to be detected in here in that disguise at such an hour!And who are these with you?""It is all your life and mosque are worth to turn us out!" Grimanswered.  "When was I ever your enemy?""Never yet, but--what does this mean?""You shall know in the morning--you alone.  This man, who canneither hear nor speak, and the child with him, must stay in heretonight, and go when they choose, unquestioned.""Jimgrim, this is not a place for setting traps for criminals.Set your watch outside, and none shall interfere with you.""'Shall the heart within be cleansed by washing hands?'" Grimquoted, and the shiekh smiled."Do you mean there are criminals within the mosque?  If so, thisis sanctuary, Jimgrim.  They shall not be disturbed.  Setwatchmen at the doors and catch them as they leave, if you will.This is holy ground.""There'll be none of it left to boast about this time tomorrow,if you choose to insist!" Grim answered."Should there be riddles between you and me?" asked the sheikh."You shall know all in the morning."The sheikh's face changed again, taking on a look of mingled rageand cunning."I know, then, what it is!  The rumour is true that those cursedZionists intend to desecrate the place.  This fellow, who you sayis deaf and dumb, is one of your spies--is he not?  Perhaps hecan smell a Zionist--eh?  Well, there are others!  Better tell methe truth, Jimgrim, and in fifteen minutes I will pack this placeso full of true Moslems that no conspirator could worm his wayin!  Then if the Jews start anything let them beware!""By the beard of your Prophet," Grim answered impiously, "thishas nothing to do with Zionists.""Neither have I, then, anything to do with this trespass.  Youhave my leave to depart at once, Jimgrim!""After the ruin--""There will be no ruin, Jimgrim!  I will fill the placewith men.""Better empty it of men!  The more there are in it, the biggerthe death-roll!  Shall I say afterwards that I begged leave toset a watch, and you refused?""You--you, Jimgrim--you talk to me of ruin and a death-roll?  Youare no every-day alarmist.""Did you ever catch me in a lie?""No, Jimgrim.  You are too clever by far for that!  If you wereto concoct a lie it would take ten angels to unravel it!  But--you speak of ruin and a death-roll, eh?"  He stroked his beardfor about a minute."You have heard, perhaps, that Moslems are sharpening theirswords for a reckoning with the Jews?  There may be some truth init.  But there shall be no gathering in this place for any suchpurpose, for I will see to that.  You need set no watch in hereon that account.""The time always comes," Grim answered, "when you must trust aman or mistrust him.  You've known me eleven years.  What are yougoing to do?""In the name of God, what shall I answer! Taib,* Jimgrim, I willtrust you.  What is it you wish?"  [*All right.]"To leave this deaf-and-dumb man and the boy, below theRock, undisturbed.""That cannot well be.  Occasionally others  go to pray in thatplace.  Also, there is a Moslem who has made the pilgrimage fromTrichinopoli.  I myself have promised to show him the mosquetonight, because he leaves Jerusalem at dawn, and only I speak alanguage he can understand.  There will be others with him, and Icannot refuse to take them down below the Rock.""That is nothing," Grim answered.  "They will think nothing of adeaf-and-dumb man praying or sleeping in a  a corner.""Is that all he wishes to do?  He will remain still in one place?Then come.""One other thing.  That fellow who went and fetched you--he sitsover there by the north door now--he will ask you questions aboutme presently.  Tell him I'm leaving for Damascus in the morning.If he asks what we have been speaking about so long, tell him Ibrought you the compliments of Mustapha Kemal.""I will tell him to go to jahannam!""Better be civil to him. His hour comes tomorrow."The sheikh led the way along one side of the inner of threeconcentric parts into which the mosque is divided by rows ofmarble columns, until we came to a cavernous opening in thefloor, where steps hewn in the naked rock led downward into acave that underlies the spot on which tradition says Abraham madeready to sacrifice his son.It was very dark below.  Only one little oil lamp was burning, ona rock shaped like an altar in one corner.  It cast leapingshadows that looked like ghosts on the smooth, uneven walls.  Thewhole place was hardly more than twenty feet wide each way.There was no furniture, not even the usual mats--nothing butnaked rock to lie or sit on, polished smooth as glass bycenturies of naked feet.I was going to sit in a corner, but Grim seized my arm andpointed to the centre of the floor, stamping with his foot toshow the exact place I should take.  It rang vaguely hollow underthe impact, and Suliman, already frightened by the shadows,seized my hand in a paroxysm of terror."You've got to prove you're a man tonight and stick it out!" Grimsaid to him in English;  and with that, rather than argue thepoint and risk a scene, he followed the sheikh up the steps anddisappeared.  Grim's methods with Suliman were a strange mixtureof understanding sympathy and downright indifference to sentimentthat got him severely criticized by the know-it-all party, whoalways, everywhere condemn.  But he certainly got results.A legion of biblical and Koranic devils owned Suliman.  They werethe child's religion.  When he dared, he spat at the name ofChristianity.  Whenever Grim whipped him, which he had to do nowand again, for theft or for filthy language, he used to curseGrim's religion, although Grim's religion was a well-kept secret,known to none but himself.  But the kid was loyal to Grim with acourage and persistence past belief, and Grim knew how to wormthe truth out of him and make him keep his word, which is morethan some of the professional reformers know how to do withtheir proteges.  I believe that Suliman would rather have earnedGrim's curt praise than all the fabulous delights of even aMoslem paradise.But the kid was in torment.  His idea of manliness precluded anyexhibition of fear in front of me, if he could possibly restrainhimself.  He would not have minded breaking down in front ofGrim, for he knew that Grim knew him inside out.  On thecontrary, he looked down on me, as a mere amateur at the game,who had never starved at the Jaffa Gate, nor eaten candle-ends,or gambled for milliemes* with cab-drivers' sons while picking upodds and ends of gossip for a government that hardly knew of hisexistence.  In front of me he proposed to act the man--guide--showman--mentor.  He considered himself my boss.  [*The smallestcoin of the country.]But it was stem work.  If there had been a little noise to makethe shadows less ghostly;  if Suliman had not been full of half-digested superstition;  or if he had not overheard enough to beaware that a prodigious, secret plot was in some way connectedwith that cavern, he could have kept his courage up by swaggeringin front of me.He nearly fell asleep, with his head in my lap, at the end ofhalf-an-hour.  But when there was a sound at last he almostscreamed.  I had to clap my hand over his mouth;  whereat hepromptly bit my finger, resentful because he knew then that Iknew he was afraid.It proved to be approaching footsteps--the sheikh of the mosqueagain, leading the man from Trichinopoli and a party of threefriends.  Their rear was brought up by Noureddin;  Ali's spy,anxious about me, but pretending to want to overhear the sheikh'saccount of things.The sheikh reeled it all off in a cultured voice accustomed tousing the exact amount of energy required, but even so his wordsboomed in the cavern like the forethought of thunder.  Youcouldn't help wondering whether a man of his intelligencebelieved quite all he said, however much impressed the man fromTrichinopoli might be."We are now beneath the very rock on which Abraham was willing tosacrifice his only son, Isaac.  This rock is the centre of theworld.  Jacob anointed it.  King Solomon built his temple overit.  The Prophet of God, the Prince Mahommed, on whose head beblessings! said of this place that it is next in order ofholiness after Mecca, and that one prayer said here is worth tenelsewhere.  Here, in this place, is where King Solomon used tokneel in prayer, and where God appeared to him.  This corner iswhere David prayed.  Here prayed Mahommed."Look up.  This hollow in the roof is over the spot where theProphet Mahommed slept.  When he arose there was not room for himto stand upright, so the Rock receded, and the hollow placeremains to this day in proof of it.  Beneath us is the Bir-el-Arwah, the well of souls, where those who have died come to praytwice weekly.  Listen!"He stamped three times with his foot on the spot about twofeet in front of where I sat, and a faint, hollow boom answeredthe impact."You hear?  The Rock speaks!  It spoke in plain words when theProphet prayed here, and was translated instantly to heaven onhis horse El-Burak.  Here, deep in the Rock, is the print of thehand of the angel, who restrained the Rock from following theProphet on his way to Paradise.  Here, in this niche, is whereAbraham used to pray;  here, Elijah.  On the last day the Kaabaof Mecca must come to this place.  For it is here, in this cave,that the blast of the trumpet will sound, announcing the day ofjudgment.  Then God's throne will be planted on the Rock aboveus.  Be humble in the presence of these marvels."He turned on his pompous heel and led the way out again withoutas much as a sidewise glance at me.  The spy was satisfied;  hefollowed the party up the rock-hewn steps, and as a matter offact went to sleep on a mat near the north door, for so I foundhim later on.The silence shut down again.  Suliman went fast asleep, snoringwith the even cadence of a clock's tick, using my knees for apillow with a perfect sense of ownership.  He was there to keepcare of me, not I of him.  The sleep suggestion very soon tookhold of me, too, for there was nothing whatever to do but sit andwatch the shadows move, trying to liken them to something real asthey changed shape in answer to the flickering of the tiny, nakedflame.  Thereafter, the vigil resolved itself into a battlewith sleep, and an effort to keep my wits sufficiently alert forsudden use.I had no watch.  There was nothing to give the least notion ofhow much time had passed.  I even counted the boy's snores for awhile, and watched one lonely louse moving along the wall--somany snores to the minute--so many snores to an inch of crawling;but the louse changed what little mind he had and did not walkstraight, and I gave up trying to calculate the distance hetraveled in zigzags and curves, although it would have been aninteresting problem for a navigator.  Finally, Suliman'ssnoring grew so loud that that in itself kept me awake;  itwas like listening to a hair-trombone;  each blast of it raspedyour nerves.You could not hear anything in the mosque above, although therewere only eleven steps and the opening was close at hand;  forthe floor above was thickly carpeted, and if there were anysounds they were swallowed by that and the great, domed roof.When I guessed it might be midnight I listened for the voice ofthe muezzin;  but if he did call the more-than-usually faithfulto wake up and pray, he did it from a minaret outside, and nofaint echo of his voice reached me.  I was closed in a tomb inthe womb of living rock, to all intents and purposes.But it must have been somewhere about midnight when I heard asound that set every vein in my body tingling.  At first it waslike the sort of sound that a rat makes gnawing;  but therecouldn't be rats eating their way through that solid stone.  Ithought I heard it a second time, but Suliman's snoring made itimpossible to listen properly.  I shook him violently, and hesat up."Keep still!  Listen!"Between sleeping and waking the boy forgot all about the ironself-control he practised for Grim's exacting sake."What is it?  I am afraid!""Be still, confound you!  Listen!""How close beneath us are the souls of the dead?  Oh, Iam afraid!""Silence!  Breathe through your mouth.  Make no noise at all!"He took my hand and tried to sit absolutely still;  but thegnawing noise began again, more distinctly, followed by two orthree dull thuds from somewhere beneath us."Oh, it is the souls of dead men!  Oh--""Shut up, you little idiot!  All right, I'll tell Jimgrim!"Fear and that threat combined were altogether too much for him.One sprig of seedling manhood remained to him, and only one--thewill to smother emotion that he could not control a secondlonger.  He buried his head in my lap, stuffing his mouth withthe end of the abiyi to choke the sobs back. I covered his headcompletely and, like the fabled ostrich, in that darkness hefelt better.Suddenly, as clear as the ring of glass against thick glass inthe distance, something gave way and fell beneath us.  Thenagain.  Then there were several thuds, followed by a rumble thatwas unmistakable--falling masonry;  it was the noise that bricksmake when they dump them from a tip-cart, only smothered by thethickness of the cavern floor.  I shook Suliman again."Come on.  We're going.  Now, let me have a good account of youto give to Jimgrim.  Shut your teeth tight, and remember the partyou've got to play."He scrambled up the steps ahead of me, and I had to keep hold ofthe skirts of his smock to prevent him from running.  But he tookmy hand at the top, and we managed to get out through the northdoor without exciting comment, and without waking the spy,although I would just as soon have wakened him, for Grim seemedto think it important that his alibi and mine should be wellestablished;  however, there were two others watching by thehotel.  Ten minutes later I was glad I had not disturbed him.I gave Suliman a two-piastre piece to pay the man who had chargeof my slippers at the door, and the young rascal was so farrecovered from his fright that he demanded change out of it, andstood there arguing until he got it.  Then, hand-in-hand, wecrossed the great moonlit open court to the gate by which Grimhad brought us in.Looking back, so bright was the moon that you could even see theblue of the tiles that cover the mosque wall, and the interwovenscroll of writing from the Koran that runs around like a friezebelow the dome.  But it did not look real.  It was like adream-picture--perhaps the dream of the men who slept huddledunder blankets in the porches by the gate.  If so, theydreamed beautifully.There was a Sikh, as Grim had said there would be, standing withfixed bayonet on the bottom step leading to the street.  Hestared hard at me, and brought his rifle to the challenge as Iapproached him--a six-foot, black-bearded stalwart he was, with along row of campaign ribbons, and the true, truculent Sikh way ofcarrying his head.  He looked strong enough to carry an ox away."Atcha!" said I, going close to him.He did not answer a word, but shouldered his rifle and marchedoff.  Before he had gone six paces he brought the rifle to thetrail, and started running.  Another Sikh--a younger man--steppedout of the shadow and took his place on the lower step.  He wasnot quite so silent, and he knew at least one word of Arabic."Imshi!" he grunted;  and that, in plain U.S. American, means"Beat it!"I had no objection.  It sounded rather like good advice.Remembering what Grim had said about the danger I was running,and looking at the deep black shadows of the streets, it occurredto me that that spy, who slept so soundly by the mosque door,might wake up and be annoyed with himself.  When men of that typeget annoyed they generally like to work it off on somebody.Rather, than admit that he had let me get away from him he mightprefer to track me through the streets and use his knife on me insome dark corner.  After that he could claim credit withNoureddin Ali by swearing he had reason to suspect me ofsomething or other.  The suggestion did not seem any more unrealto me than the moonlit panorama of the Haram-es-Sheriff, or theSikh who had stepped out of nowhere-at-all to "Imshi" me away.On the other hand, I had no fancy for the hotel steps.  To sitand fall asleep there would be to place myself at the mercy ofthe other two spies, who might come and search me;  and I wasconscious of certain papers in an inner pocket, and of underclothesmade in America, that might have given the game away.Besides, I was no longer any too sure of Suliman.  The boy was sosleepy that his wits were hardly in working order;  if those twospies by the hotel were to question him he might betray the twoof us by some clumsy answer.  If there was to be trouble thatnight I preferred to have it at the hands of Sikhs, who areseldom very drastic unless you show violence.  I might bearrested if I walked the streets, but that would be sheer profitas compared to half-a-yard of cold knife in the broad of my back."Take me to the house where you talked with your mother," I saidto Suliman.So we turned to the left and set off together in that direction,watched with something more than mild suspicion by the Sikh, and,if Suliman's sensations were anything like mine, feeling about ascheerless, homeless and aware of impending evil as the dogs thatslunk away into the night.  I took advantage of the first deepshadow I could find to walk in, less minded to explore than toavoid pursuit.Chapter Eighteen"But we're ready for them."Without in the least suspecting it I had gone straight into ablind trap, into which, it was true, I could not be followed byNoureddin Ali's spy, but out of which there was no escape withoutbeing recognized.  The moment I stepped into the deep shadow Iheard an unmistakable massed movement behind me.  Sure that Icould not be seen, I faced about.  A platoon of Sikhs hadappeared from somewhere, and were standing at ease already,across the end of the street I had entered, with the moonlightsilvering their bayonets.Well, most streets have two ends.  So I walked forward, nottaking much trouble about concealment, since it was not easy towalk silently.  If the Sikh can't see his enemy he likes to firefirst and challenge afterwards.  I preferred to be seen.  Thesight of those uncompromising bayonets had changed my mind aboutthe choice of evils.  The knife of a hardly probable assassinseemed a wiser risk than the ready triggers of the Punjaub.Half-way down the street Suliman tugged at my cloak."That is the place where my mother is," he said, pointing to anarrow door on the left.But I was taking no chances in that direction--not at thatmoment.  The little stone house was all in darkness.  There wereno windows that I could see.  No sound came from it.  And fartherdown the street there was a lamp burning, whose light spelledsafety from shots fired at the sound of foot-fall on suspicion.I wanted that light between me and the Sikh platoon, yet did notdare run for it, since that would surely have started trouble.It is my experience of Sikhs that when they start a thing theylike to finish it.  They are very good indeed at explanationsafter the event.The Sikhs must have seen us pass through the belt of gasolinelight, but they did not challenge, so I went forward more slowly,with rather less of that creepy feeling that makes a man's spineseem to belong to some one else.  Toward its lower end the streetcurved considerably, and we went about a quarter of a mile beforethe glare of another light began to appear around the bend.That was at a cross-street, up which I proposed to turn more orless in the direction of the hotel.  But I did nothing of thesort.  There was a cordon of Sikhs drawn across there, too, withno British officer in sight to enforce discretion.Come to think of it, I have always regarded a bayonet wound inthe stomach as the least desirable of life's unpleasantries.So Suliman and I turned back.  I decided to investigate that darklittle stone house, after all;  for it occurred to me that, ifthat was the centre of conspiracy, then Grim would certainly showup there sooner or later and straighten out the predicament.Have you ever noticed how hungry you get walking about aimlesslyin the dark, especially when you are sleepy in the bargain?Suliman began to whimper for food, and although I called him abelly on legs by way of encouragement he had my secret sympathy.I was as hungry as he was;  and I needed a drink, too, which hedidn't.  The little devil hadn't yet included whiskey in his listof vices.The side of the street an which the little stone house stood wasthe darker, so we sat down with our backs against its wall, andthe boy proceeded to fall asleep at once.  The one thing I wassure I must not do was imitate him.  So I began to look about mein the hope of finding something sufficiently interesting to keepme awake.There was nothing in the street except the makings of a badsmell.  There was plenty of that.  I searched the opposite wall,on which the moon shone, but there was nothing there of evenarchitectural interest.  My eyes traveled higher, and rested atlast on something extremely curious.The wall was not very high at that point.  It formed the blindrear of a house that faced into a court of some sort approachedby an alley from another street.  There were no windows.  A smalldoor some distance to my left belonged obviously to the nexthouse.  On top of the wall, almost exactly, but not quite, in themiddle of it, was a figure that looked like a wooden carving--something like one of those fat, seated Chinamen they used to setover the tea counter of big grocer's shops.But the one thing that you never see, and can be sure of notseeing in Jerusalem outside of a Christian church, is a carvedhuman figure of any kind.  The Moslems are fanatical on thatpoint.  Whatever exterior statues the crusaders for instanceleft, the Saracens and Turks destroyed.  Besides, why was it notexactly in the middle?It was much too big and thick-set to be a sleeping vulture.  Itwas the wrong shape to be any sort of chimney.  It was certainlynot a bale of merchandise put up on the roof to dry.  And thelonger you looked at it the less it seemed to resemble anythingrecognizable.  I had about reached the conclusion that it must bea bundle of sheepskins up-ended, ready to be spread out in themorning sun, and was going to cast about for something else topuzzle over, when it moved.  The man who thinks he would not feelafraid when a thing like that moves in the dark unexpectedly hasgot to prove it before I believe him.  The goose-flesh broke outall over me.A moment later the thing tilted forward, and a man's head emergedfrom under a blanket.  It chuckled damnably.  If there had been arock of the right size within reach I would have thrown it, forit is not agreeable to be chuckled at when you are hungry,sleepy, and in a trap.  I know just how trapped animals feel.But then it spoke in good plain English;  and you could notmistake the voice."That's what comes of suiting yourself, doesn't it!  Placeplugged at both ends, and nowhere to go but there and back!Thanks for tipping off Narayan Singh--you see, we were all ready.Here's a pass that'll let you out--catch!"He threw down a piece of white paper, folded."Show that to the Sikhs at either end.  Now beat it, while thegoing's good.  Leave Suliman there.  I shall want him when he hashad his sleep out.  Say:  hadn't you better change your   mindabout coming back too soon from that joy ride?  Haven't you hadenough of this?  The next move's dangerous.""Is it my choice?" I asked."We owe you some consideration.""Then I'm in on the last act.""All right.  But don't blame me.  Turner will give you orders.Get a move on."I lowered Suliman's head gently from my knee on to a nicecomfortable corner of the stone gutter, and went up-street tointerview the Sikhs.  It was rather like a New York Customsinspection, after your cabin steward has not been heavily enoughtipped, and has tipped off the men in blue by way of distributingthe discontent.  I showed them the safe-pass Grim had scribbled.They accepted that as dubious preliminary evidence of my right tobe alive, but no more.  I was searched painstakingly andignominiously for weapons.  No questions asked.  Nothing takenfor granted.  Even my small change was examined in the moonlight,coin by coin, to make sure, I suppose, that it wouldn't explodeif struck on stone.  They gave everything back to me, includingmy underwear.A bearded non-commissioned officer entered a description of me ina pocket memorandum book.  If his face, as he wrote it, wasanything to judge by he described me as a leper without alicense.  Then I was cautioned gruffly in an unknown tongue andtold to "imshi!"  It isn't a bad plan to "imshi" rather quicklywhen a Sikh platoon suggests your doing it.  I left them standingall alone, with nothing but the empty night to bristle at.The rest of that night, until half-an-hour before dawn was ahalf-waking dream of discomfort and chilly draughts in the mouthof the hotel arcade, where I sat and watched the spies, and theywatched me.  The third man was presumably still sleeping in themosque, but it was satisfactory to know that the other two werejust as cold and unhappy as I felt.About ten minutes before the car came the third man showed upsheepishly, looking surprised as well as relieved to find mesitting there.  He put in several minutes explaining matters tohis friends.  I don't doubt he lied like a horse-trader and gavea detailed account of having followed me from place to place, forhe used a great deal of pantomimic gesture.  The other two werecynical with the air of men who must sit and listen to anotherblowing his own trumpet.The car arrived with a fanfare of horn-blowing, the chauffeurevidently having had instructions to call lots of attention tohimself.  Turner came out at once, with the lower part of hisface protected against the morning chill by a muffler.  Beingabout the same height, and in that Syrian uniform, he lookedremarkably like Grim, except that he did not imitate the stridenearly as well.He stumbled over me, clutched my shoulder and made signs for thebenefit of the spies.  Then he whispered to me to help him carryout the "money" bags.  So we each took three for the first trip,and each contrived to drop one.  By the time all ten bags were inthe car there can hardly have remained any doubt in theconspirators' minds that we were really taking funds to MustaphaKemal, or at any rate to somebody up north.But Davey was no half-way concession maker.  Having lent himselfunwillingly to the trick, he did his utmost to make it succeed,like a good sport.  He stuck his head out of a bedroom window."Don't forget, now, to send me those rugs from Damascus!"he shouted.It all went like clockwork.  Glancing back as we drove by theJaffa Gate I saw the three spies walk away, and there is veryoften more information in men's backs than in their faces.  Theywalked like laborers returning home with a day's work behindthem, finished;  not at all like men in doubt, nor as if theysuspected they were followed, although in fact they were.  ThreeSikhs emerged from the corner by the Gate and strolled alongbehind them.  Detailed preparations for the round-up had begun.The unostentatious mechanism of it seemed more weird and terriblethan the conspiracy itself.There was a full company of Sikhs standing to arms in a sidestreet leading off the Jaffa Road, but they took no notice of us.Their officer looked keenly at us once, and then verydeliberately stared the other way, illustrating how some fightingmen make pretty poor dissemblers;  every one of his dark-skinnedrank and file had observed all the details of our outfit withoutseeming to see us at all."We're using nothing but Sikhs on this job," said Turner."British troops wouldn't appreciate the delicacy of thesituation.  Moslems couldn't be trusted not to talk.  The Sikhsenjoy the surreptitious part of it, and don't care enough aboutthe politics to get excited.  Wish I might be in at the finish,though!  Have you any notion what the real objective is?""No," said I, and tried not to feel, or look pleased with myself.But no mere amateur can conceal that, in the moment of discovery,he knows more about the inside of an official business than oneof the Administration's lawful agents.  That is nine-tenths ofthe secret of "bossed" politics--the sheer vanity of being on theinside, "in the know."  I suppose I smirked.   "Damn this rideto Haifa!  What the hell have you done, I wonder, that you shouldhave a front pew?  Is the Intelligence short of officers?"I had done nothing beyond making Grim's acquaintance and by goodluck tickling his flair for odd friendship.  I thought it betternot to say that, so I went on lying."I don't suppose I know any more than you do.""Rot!  I posted the men who watched you into Djemal's placeyesterday, and watched you out again.  You acted pretty poorly,if you ask me.  It's a marvel we didn't have to go in there andrescue you.  I suppose you're another of Grim's favorites.  Hepicks some funny ones.  Half the men in jail seem to be friendsof his."I decided to change the subject."I was told to change clothes and walk back after a mile or so,"I said.  "Suppose we don't make it a Marathon.  Why walk fartherthan we need to?""Uh!"I think he was feeling sore enough to take me ten miles for thesatisfaction of making me tramp them back to Jerusalem.  But itturned out not to be his day for working off grievances.  We werebowling along pretty fast, and had just reached open countrywhere it would be a simple matter to change into other clotheswithout risk of being seen doing it, when we began to beoverhauled by another, larger car that came along at a terrificpace.  It was still too dark to make out who was in it until itdrew almost abreast."The Administrator by the Horn Spoon!  What next, I wonder!  Pullup!" said Turner.  "Morning, sir."The two cars came to a standstill.  The Administrator leaned out."I think I can save you a walk," he said, smiling.  "How aboutchanging your clothes between the cars and driving back with me?"I did not even know yet what new disguise I was to assume, butTurner opened a hand-bag and produced a suit of my own clothesand a soft hat."Burgled your bedroom," he explained.All he had forgotten was suspenders.  No doubt it would havegiven him immense joy to think of me walking back ten mileswithout them.Sir Louis gave his orders while I changed clothes."You'd better keep going for some time, Turner.  No need to goall the way to Haifa, but don't get back to Jerusalem beforenoon at the earliest, and be sure you don't talk to anybody onyour way."Turner drove on.  I got in beside the Administrator."Grim tells me that you don't object to a certain amount of risk.You've been very useful, and he thinks you would like to see theend of the business.  I wouldn't think of agreeing to it, only weshall have to call on you as a witness against Scharnhoff andNoureddin Ali.  As you seem able to keep still about what youknow, it seems wiser not to change witnesses at this stage.  Itis highly important that we should have one unofficial observer,who is neither Jew nor Moslem, and who has no private interest toserve.  But I warn you, what is likely to happen this morningwill be risky."I looked at the scar on his cheek, and the campaign ribbons, andthe attitude of absolute poise that can only be attained by yearsof familiarity with danger."Why do you soldiers always act like nursemaids towardcivilians?" I asked him.  "We're bone of your bone."He laughed."Entrenched privilege!  If we let you know too much you'd thinktoo little of us!"We stopped at a Jew's store outside the city for suspenders, andthen made the circuit outside the walls in a whirlwind of dust,stopping only at each gate to get reports from the officerscommanding companies drawn up in readiness to march in and policethe city."It's all over the place that disaster of some sort is going tohappen today," said Sir Louis.  "It only needs a hatful ofrumours to set Jerusalemites at one another's throats.  But we'reready for them.  The first to start trouble this morning will bethe first to get it.  Now--sorry you've no time for breakfast--here's the Jaffa Gate.  Will you walk through the city to thatstreet where Grim talked with you from a roof last night?  You'llfind him thereabouts.  Sure you know the way?  Good-bye.  Goodluck!  No, you won't need a pass;  there'll be nobody tointerfere with you."Chapter Nineteen"Dead or alive, sahib."I did get breakfast nevertheless, but in a strange place.  Thecity shutters were coming down only under protest, because, justas in Boston and other hubs of sanctity, shop-looting starts lessthan five minutes after the police let go control.  There was anaverage, that morning, of about ten rumours to the ear.  So theshop-keepers had to be ordered to open up.  About the mildestrumour was that the British had decide to vacate and to leave theZionists in charge of things.  You couldn't fool an experiencedJew as to what would happen in that event.  There was anotherrumour that Mustapha Kemal was on the march.  Another that anArab army was invading from the direction of El-Kerak.  But therewere British officers walking about with memorandum books, and afifty-pound fine looked more serious than an outbreak that hadnot occurred yet.  So they were putting down their shutters.I had nearly reached the Haram-es-Sheriff, and was passing aplatoon of Sikhs who dozed beside their rifles near a streetcorner, when Grim's voice hailed me through the half-open doorbehind them.  He was back in his favourite disguise as a Bedouin,squatting on a mat near the entrance of a vaulted room, where hecould see through the door without being seen."This is headquarters for the present," he explained.  "Soon aswe bag the game we'll run 'em in here quick as lightning.  Mostlikely keep 'em here all day, so's not to have to parade 'emthrough the streets until after dark.  A man's coming soon withcoffee and stuff to eat.""What's become of Suliman?""He's shooting craps with two other young villains close towhere you left him last night.  I'm hoping he'll get word withhis mother."Grim looked more nervous than I had ever seen him.  There was adeep frown between his eyes.  He talked as if he were doing it tokeep himself from worrying."What's eating you?" I asked."Noureddin Ali.  After all this trouble to bag the whole gangwithout any fuss there's a chance he's given us the slip.  Iwatched all night to make sure he didn't come out of that door.He didn't.  But I've no proof he's in there.  Scharnhoff's inthere, and five of the chief conspirators.  Noureddin Ali may be.But a man brought me a story an hour ago about seeing him on thecity wall.  However, here's the food.  So let's eat."He sat and munched gloomily, until presently Goodenough joinedus, looking, what with that monocle and one thing and another, asif he had just stepped out of a band-box."Well, Grim, the net's all ready.  If that TNT is where you sayit is, in that big barn behind the fruit-stalls near the JaffaGate, it's ours the minute they make a move.""There isn't a doubt on that point," Grim answered.  "Why elseshould Scharnhoff open a fruit-shop?  The license for it wastaken out by one of Noureddin Ali's agents, whose brother dealsin fruit wholesale and owns that barn.  Narayan Singh trackedsome suspicious packages to that place four days ago.  They'llstart to carry it into the city hidden under loads of fruit justas soon as the morning crowd begins to pour in.  We only need letthem get the first consignment in, so as to have the chain ofevidence complete.  Are you sure your men will let the first lotgo through?""Absolutely.  Just came from giving them very carefulinstructions. The minute that first load disappears into the citythey'll close in on the barn and arrest every one they find inthere.  But what are you gloomy about?""I'd hate to miss the big fish.""You mean Noureddin Ali ?""It looks to me as if he's been a shade too wise for us.  One manswore he saw him on the wall this morning, but he was gone when Isent to make sure.  We've got all the rest.  There are five inDjemal's Cafe, waiting for the big news;  they'll be handcuffedone at a time by the police when they get tired of waiting andcome out."But I'd rather bag Noureddin Ali than all the others puttogether.  He's got brains, that little beast has.  He'd know howto use this story against us with almost as much effect as ifhe'd pulled the outrage off."He had hardly finished speaking when Narayan Singh's great bulkdarkened the doorway.  He closed the door behind him, as ifafraid the other Sikhs might learn bad news."It is true, sahib.  He was on the wall.  He is there again.""Have you seen him?""Surely.  He makes signals to the men who are loading the donkeysnow in the door of the barn.  It would be a difficult shot.  Hishead hardly shows between the battlements.  But I think I couldhit him from the road below.  Shall I try?""No, you'd only scare him into hiding if you miss.  Oh hell!There are three ways up on to the wall at that point.  There's notime to block them all--not if he's signalling now.  He'll seeyour men close in on the barn, sir, and beat it for the skyline.Oh, damn and blast the luck!""At least we can try to cut him off," said Goodenough.  "I'lltake some men myself and have a crack at it.""No use, sir.  You'd never catch sight of him.  I wish you'd letNarayan Singh take three men, make for the wall by the shortestway, and hunt him if it takes a week.""Why not?  All right.  D'you hear that, Narayan Singh?""Atcha, sahib.""You understand?" said Grim.  "Keep him moving.  Keep after him.""Do the sahibs wish him alive or dead?""Either way," said Goodenough."If he's gone from the wall when you get there," Grim added,"bring us the news.  You'll know where to find us""Atcha"The Sikh brought his rifle to the shoulder, faced about,marched out, chose three men from the platoon in the street,and vanished."Too bad, too bad!" said Goodenough, but Grim did not answer.  Hewas swearing a blue streak under his breath.  The next to arriveon the scene was Suliman, grinning with delight because he hadwon all the money of the other urchins, but brimming with news inthe bargain.  He considered a mere colonel of cavalry beneathnotice, and addressed himself to Grim without ceremony."My mother brought out oranges in baskets and set them on bencheson both sides of the door.  Then she went in, and I heard herscream.  There was a fight inside.""D'you care to bet, sir?" asked Grim."On what?""I'll bet you a hundred piastres Scharnhoff has tried to make hisget-away, and they've either killed him or tied him hand andfoot.  Another hundred on top of that, that Scharnhoff offers toturn state witness, provided he's alive when we show up.""All right.  I'll bet you he hangs.""Are you coming with us, sir?""Wouldn't miss it for a king's ransom.""The back way out, then."Grim beckoned the Sikhs into the room, left one man in there incharge of Suliman, who swore blasphemously at being left behind,and led the way down a passage that opened into an alleyconnecting with a maze of others like rat runs, mostly archedover and all smelly with the unwashed gloom of ages.  At the endof the last alley we entered was a flight of stone steps, upwhich we climbed to the roof of the house on which I had seenGrim the night before.There was a low coping on the side next the street, and some onehad laid a lot of bundles of odds and ends against it;  lyingdown, we could look out between those without any risk of beingseen from below, but Goodenough made the Sikhs keep well in thebackground and only we three peered over the edge.  About twohundred yards in front of us the Dome of the Rock glistened inthe morning sun above the intervening roofs.  The street wasalmost deserted, although the guards at either end had beenremoved for fear of scaring away the conspirators.  We watchedfor about twenty minutes before any one passed but occasionalbeggars, some of whom stopped to wonder why oranges should standon sale outside a door with nobody in charge of them.  Threeseparate individuals glanced right and left and then helpedthemselves pretty liberally from the baskets.But at last there came five donkeys very heavily loaded withoranges and raisins, in charge of six men, which was a more thanliberal allowance.  When they stopped at the little stone housein front of us there was another thing noticeable;  instead ofhitting the donkeys hard on the nose with a thick club, which isthe usual way of calling a halt in Palestine, they went to theheads and stopped them reasonably gently.  So, although all sixmen were dressed to resemble peasants, they were certainlynothing of the kind.Nor were they such wide-awake conspirators as they believedthemselves, for they were not in the least suspicious of sixother men, also dressed as peasants, who followed them up-street,and sat down in full view with their backs against a wall.  Yet Icould see quite plainly the scabbard of a bayonet projectingthrough a hole in the ragged cloak of the nearest of thosecasual wayfarers.They had to knock several minutes before the door openedgingerly;  then they off-loaded the donkeys, and it took two mento carry each basketful, with a third lending a hand in case ofaccident.  Only one man went back with the donkeys, and two ofthe casual loafers against the wall got up to saunter after him;the other five honest merchants went inside, and we heard thebolt shoot into its iron slot behind them."How about it, Grim?" asked Goodenough then."Ready, sir.  Will you give the order?"We filed in a hurry down the steps into the alley, ran in a zig-zag down three passages, and reached another alley with narrowdoor at its end that faced the street.  Grim had made everypreparation.  There was a heavy baulk of timber lying near thedoor, with rope-handles knotted into holes bored through it atintervals.  The Sikhs picked that up and followed us intothe street.The mechanism of the Administration's net was a thing to wonderat.  As we emerged through the door the "peasants" who wereloafing with their backs against the wall got up and formed acordon across the street.  Simultaneously, although I neither sawnor heard any signal, a dozen Sikhs under a British officer camedown the street from the other direction at the double and formedup in line on our lefthand.  A moment later, our men werebattering the door down with their baulk of timber, working alltogether as if they had practised the stunt thoroughly.It was a stout door, three inches thick, of ancient olivewood andreinforced with forged iron bands.  The hinges, too, had beenmade by hand in the days when, if a man's house was not hisfortress, he might just as well own nothing;  they were cementeddeep into the wall, and fastened to the door itself with half-inch iron rivets.  The door had to be smashed to pieces, and thenoise we made would have warned the devils in the middle ofthe world."We shouldn't have let them get in with any TNT at all," saidGoodenough.  "They'll touch it off before we can prevent them.""Uh-uh!  They're not that kind," Grim answered.  "They'll fightfor their skins.  Have your gun ready, sir.  They've laid theirplans for a time-fuse and a quick getaway.  They'll figure thegoing may be good still if they can once get past us.  Look outfor a rush!"But when the door went down at last in a mess of splintersthere was no rush--nothing but silence--a dark, square, stoneroom containing two cots and a table, and fruit scattered allover the floor amid gray dust and fragments of cement.  Grimlaughed curtly."Look, sir!"The fruit-baskets were on the floor by one of the cots, and theTNT containers were still in them.  They had tipped out thefruit, and then run at the sound of the battering ram.Goodenough stepped into the room, and we followed him.  Beyondthe table, half-hidden by a great stone slab, was a dark hole inthe floor.  Evidently the last man through had tried to cover upthe hole, but had found the stone too heavy.  The Sikhs draggedit clear and disclosed the mouth of a tunnel, rather less than aman's height, sloping sharply downward."What we need now is mustard gas.  Smoke 'em out,"said Goodenough."Might kill 'em," Grim objected."That'd be too bad, wouldn't it!""We could starve 'em out, for that matter," said Grim.  "Butthey've probably got water down there, and perhaps food.  Everyhour of delay adds to the risk of rioting.  We've got to get thishole sealed up permanently, and deny that it was ever opened.""We could do that at once!  But I won't be a party to sealing 'emup alive.""Besides, sir, they've certainly got firearms, and they mightjust possible have one can of TNT down there.""All right," said Goodenough.  "I'll lead the way down.""I've a plan," said Grim.He took one of the fruit-baskets and began breaking it up."Who has a white shirt?" he asked.I was the haberdasher.  The others, Sikhs included, were allclothed in khaki from coat to skin.  Grim's Bedouin array wasdark-brown.  I peeled the shirt off, and Grim rigged it on aframe of basket-work, with a clumsy pitch-forked arrangement ofwithes at the bottom.  The idea was not obvious until he twistedthe withes about his waist;  then, when he bent down, the shirtstood up erect above him."If you don't mind, sir, we'll have two or three Sikhs go first.Have them take their boots off and crawl quietly as flat down asthey can keep.  I'll follow 'em with this contraption.  They'llbe able to see the white shirt dimly against the tunnel, and ifthey do any shooting they'll aim at that.  Then if the rest ofyou keep low behind me we've a good chance to rush them beforethey can do any damage."I never met a commanding officer more free from personal conceitthan Goodenough, and as I came to know more of him later on thatcharacteristic stood out increasingly.  He was not so much a manof ideas as one who could recognize them.  That done, he made useof his authority to back up his subordinates, claiming no creditfor himself but always seeing to it that they got theirs.The result was that he was simultaneously despised and loved--despised by the self-advertising school, of which there areplenty in every army, and loved--with something like fanaticismby his junior officers and men."I agree to that," he said simply, screwing in his monocle.  Thenhe turned and instructed the Sikhs in their own language."You follow last," he said to me.  "Now--all ready?"He had a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other, buthad to stow them both away again in order to crawl in the tunnel.Grim had no weapon in sight.  The two Sikhs who were to lead hadstripped themselves of everything that might make a noise, butthe others kept both boots and rifles, with bayonets fixed, forit did not much matter what racket they made.  In fact, the morenoise we, who followed, made, the better, since that would drawattention from the Sikhs in front.  All we had to do was to keepour bodies below Grim's kite affair, out of the probable lineof fire.Nevertheless, that dark hole was untempting.  A dank smell cameout of it, like the breath of those old Egyptian tombs in whichthe bones of horses, buried with their masters, lie all about onshelves.  You couldn't see into it more than a yard or two, forthe only light came through the doorway of the windowless room,and the tunnel led into the womb of rock where, perhaps, no lighthad been since Solomon's day.But the leading Sikhs went in without hesitation and got down ontheir bellies.  They might have been swallowed whole for all thatI heard or saw of them from that minute.  You could guess why theTurks and Germans had not really craved to meet those fellows outin No-man's-land.Grim went in on all-fours like a weird animal, with my shirtdancing on its frame above his back.  Goodenough went next,peering through that window-pane monocle like a deep-sea fish.All the rest of the Sikhs went after him in Indian file, draggingtheir rifle-butts along the tunnel floor and making noise enoughto remind you of the New York subway.I went in at the tail end, trying at intervals to peer around akhaki-covered Punjaub rump, alternately getting my head andfingers bruised by heels I could not see and a rifle-butt thatonly moved in jerks when you didn't expect it to.  My nose wasbleeding at the end of ten yards.But you couldn't keep your distance.  Whenever the men in frontchecked at some obstruction or paused to listen, all those behindclosed up;  and by the time those behind had run their nosesagainst iron-shod heels the men in front were on their way again.You couldn't see a thing until you rammed your head into it, andthen the sense of touch gave you a sort of sight suggestion, aswhen you see things in a dream.  As for sound, the tunnel actedlike a whispering gallery, mixing all the noises up together, sothat you could not guess whether a man had spoken, or a stone hadfallen, or a pistol had gone off, or all three.Once or twice, when the line closed up on itself caterpillar-fashion, I was able to make out my white shirt dancing dimly;and once, where some trick of the tunnel sorted out the sounds, Icaught a scrap of conversation."D'you suppose they'll be able to see the shirt?""God knows.  I can hardly make it out from here.""When it looks like the right time to you, sir, turn theflashlight on it.""All right.  God damn! Keep on going--you nearly knocked outmy eye-glass!"Even over my shoulder, looking backward, I could see practicallynothing, for what little light came in through the opening wasswallowed by the first few yards.  There was a suspicion ofpaleness in the gloom behind, and the occasional suggestion of anoutline of rough wall;  no more.Nor was the tunnel straight by any means.  It turned and twistedconstantly;  and at every bend the men who originally closed ithad built up a wall of heavy masonry that Scharnhoff had had toforce his way through.  In those places the broken stones werenow lying in the fairway, as you knew by the suffering when youcame in contact with them;  some of the split-off edges were assharp as glass.It was good fun, all the same, while it lasted.  If we had beencrawling down a sewer, or a modern passage of any kind, the senseof danger and discomfort would, no doubt, have overwhelmed allother considerations.  But, even supposing Scharnhoff had been ona vain hunt, and the veritable Tomb of the Kings of Judah did notlie somewhere in the dark ahead of us, we were nevertheless underthe foundations of Solomon's temple, groping our way intomysteries that had not been disclosed, perhaps, since the dayswhen the Queen of Sheba came and paid her homage to the mostwise king.  You could feel afraid, but you couldn't wish youweren't there.I have no idea how long it took to crawl the length of that blackpassage.  It seemed like hours.  I heard heavy footsteps behindme after a while.  Some one following in a hurry, who could seeno better than we could, kept stumbling over the falling masonry;and once, when he fell headlong, I heard him swear titanically ina foreign tongue.  I called back to whoever it was to crawlunless he wanted to be shot, but probably the words were allmixed up in the tunnel echoes, for he came on as before.Then all at once Goodenough flashed on the light for a fractionof a second and the shirt showed like a phantom out of blackness.The instant answer to that was a regular volley of shots from infront.  The flash of several pistols lit up the tunnel, andbullets rattled off the walls and roof.  The shirt fell, shotloose from its moorings, and the leading Sikhs gave a shout asthey started to rush forward.We all surged after them, but there was a sudden check, followedby a babel worse than when a dozen pi-dogs fight over a rubbish-heap.  You couldn't make head or tail of it, except thatsomething desperate was happening in front, until suddenly a manwith a knife in his hand, too wild with fear to use it, cameleaping and scrambling over the backs of Sikhs, like a forwardbucking the line.  The Sikh in front of me knelt upright andcollared him round the knees.  The two went down together, I ontop of both of them with blood running down my arm, for the manhad started to use his knife at last, slashing out at random, andI rather think that slight cut he gave me saved the Sikh's life.But you can make any kind of calculation afterwards, about whattook place in absolute darkness, without the least fear of beingproven wrong.  And since the Sikh and I agreed on that point noother opinion matters.I think that between the two of us we had that man aboutnonplused, although we couldn't see.  I had his knife, and theSikh was kneeling on his stomach, when a hundred and eightypounds of bone and muscle catapulted at us from the rear andsprawled on us headlong, saved by only a miracle from skeweringsome one with a bayonet as he fell.He laughed while he fought, this newcomer, and even askedquestions in the Sikh tongue.  He had my arm in a grip like avise and wrenched at it until I cursed him.  Then he found a legin the dark and nearly broke that, only to discover it was theother Sikh's.  Still laughing, as if blindfolded fighting was hismeat and drink, he reached again, and this time his fingersclosed on enemy flesh.  Judging by the yells, they hurt, too.There must have been at least another minute of cat-and-dog-fightstruggling--hands being stepped on and throats clutched--beforeGoodenough rolled himself free from an antagonist in front and,groping for the flashlight, found it and flashed it on.  Thefirst thing I recognized by its light was the face of NarayanSingh, with wonderful white teeth grinning through his blackbeard within six inches of my nose."Damn you!" I laughed.  "You weigh a ton.  Get off--you nearlykilled me!""Nearly, in war-time, means a whole new life to lose, sahib.  Bepleased to make the most of it!" he answered.Within two minutes after that we had eight prisoners disarmed andsubdued, some of them rather the worse for battery.  The amazingthing was that we hadn't a serious casualty among the lot of us.We could have totaled a square yard of skin, no doubt, and abushel of bruises (if that is the way you measure them) but minewas the only knife-wound.  I felt beastly proud.By the light of the electric torch we dragged and prodded theprisoners back whence they had come, and presently Grim orsomebody found a lantern and lit it.  We found ourselves in asquare cavern--a perfect cube it looked like--about thirty feetwide each way.In the midst was a plain stone coffer with its lid removed andset on end against it.  In the coffer lay a tall man's skeleton,with the chin still bound in linen browned with age.  There wereother fragments of linen here and there, but the skeleton's boneshad been disturbed and had fallen more or less apart.Over in one corner were two large bundles done up in modern gunny-bags, and Grim went over to examine them."Hello!" he said.  "Here's Scharnhoff and his lady friend!"He ripped the lashings of both bundles and disclosed the Austrianand the woman, gagged and tied, both almost unconscious frominability to breathe, but not much hurt otherwise.The Sikhs herded the prisoners, old alligator-eyes among them,into another corner.  Grim tore my shirt into strips to bandagemy arm with.  Goodenough talked with Narayan Singh, while wewaited for Scharnhoff to recover full consciousness."Those murderers!" he gasped at last.  "Schweinehunde!""Better spill the beans, old boy," Grim said, smiling down athim.  "You'll hang at the same time they do, if you can't tell astraight story.""Ach!  I do not care!  There were no manuscripts--nothing!  Idon't know whose skeleton that is--some old king David, perhaps;for that is not David's real tomb that the guides show.  Hangthose murderers and I am satisfied!""Your story may help hang them.  Come on, out with it!""Have you caught Noureddin Ali?""Never mind!""But I do mind!  And you should mind!"Scharnhoff sat up excitedly.  He was dressed in the Arab garmentsI had seen in his cupboard that day when Grim and I called onhim, with a scholar's turban that made him look very distinguishedin spite of his disarray."That Noureddin Ali is a devil!  Together we would look for theTomb of the Kings.  Together we would smuggle out the manuscripts--translate them together--publish the result together.  He lentme money.  He promised to bring explosives.  Oh, he was full ofenthusiasm!  It was not until last night, when I had broken thatlast obstruction down and discovered nothing but this coffin,that I learned his real plan.  The devil intended all along tofill this tomb with high explosive and to destroy the mosque above,with everybody in it!  Curse him!""Never mind cursing him," said Grim, "tell us the story.""He sent oranges here, all marked with the labels of a Zionistcolony.  When I told him that the explosive would arrive toolate, he said I should use it to smash these walls and findanother tomb.  He himself disappeared, and when I questionedhis men they told me the explosive would be brought in hiddenunder fruit in baskets.  I waited then in the hope of killinghim myself--""Hah-hah!" laughed Grim."That is true!  But they bound me, and later on bound the woman,and laid us here to be blown up together with the mosque."Grim turned to Goodenough, who had been listening."Do I win the bet, sir?""Ten piastoes!" said Goodenough.  "Yes. Narayan Singh saysNoureddin Ali was gone by the time they reached the wall.""Sure, or he'd have brought Noureddin Ali.  I've been thinking,sir.  We've one chance left to bag that buzzard.  Will you giveme carte blanche?""Yes.  Go ahead."Grim crossed the place to the corner where old alligator-eyesstood herded with the other prisoners."Are you guilty?" he demanded."No.  Guilty of nothing.  I came out of curiosity to see what washappening here.""Thought so.  Can you hold your tongue?  Then go!  Get outof here!"Alligator-eyes didn't wait for a second urging, nor stay toquestion his good luck, but went off in a shambling hurry."You are mad!" exclaimed Scharnhoff.  "That man is the next-worst!""Grim, are you sure that's wise?" asked Goodenough."We can get him any time we want him, sir," Grim answered.  "Helacks Noureddin Ali's gift of slipperiness."He turned to Narayan Singh."Follow that man, but don't let him know he's followed.  He'llshow you where Noureddin Ali is.  Get him this time!""Dead or alive, sahib?""Either."Chapter Twenty"All men are equal in the dark."The first thing Goodenough did after Grim had sent Narayan Singhoff on his deadly mission was to summon the sheikh of the Dome ofthe Rock.  He himself went to fetch him rather than risk havingthe sheikh bring a crowd of witnesses, who would be sure to talkafterwards.  The all-important thing was to conceal the fact thatsacrilege had been committed.  But it was also necessary toestablish the fact that Zionists had had no hand in it."You see," Grim explained, sitting on the edge of the stonecoffin, "we could hold Jerusalem.  But if word of this businesswere to spread far and wide, you couldn't hold two or threehundred million fanatics;  and believe me, they'd cut loose!""The sheikh must realize that," said I.  "What do you bet mehe won't try to black-mail the Administration on the strengthof it?""I'll bet you my job!  Watch the old bird.  Listen in.  He'sdowny.  He knows a chance when he sees it, and he might tryto cheat you at dominoes.  But in a big crisis he's a numberone man."While we waited we tried to get an opinion out of Scharnhoffabout the coffin and the skeleton inside it.  But the old fellowwas heart-broken.  I think he told the truth when he said hecouldn't explain it."What is there to say of it, except that it is very ancient?There is no decoration.  The coffin is beautifully shaped out ofone solid piece of stone, but that is all.  The skeleton is thatof an old man, who seems to have been wounded once or twice inbattle.  The linen is good, but there is no jewelry;  noornaments.  And it is buried here in a very sacred place, soprobably, it is one of the Jewish kings, or else one of theprophets.  It might be King David--who knows?  And what do Icare?  It is what a man sets down on parchment, and not his bonesthat interest me!"The sheikh arrived at last, following Goodenough down the darkpassage with the supreme nonchalance of the priest too longfamiliar with sacred places to be thrilled or frightened by them.He stood in the entrance gazing about him, blinking speculativelythrough the folds of fat surrounding his bright eyes.  Goodenoughtook the lantern and held it close to the prisoners' faces oneby one."You see?" he said.  "All Syrians.  All Moslems.  Not a Jew amongthem.  I'll take you and show you the others presently.""What will you do with them?""That's for a court to decide.  Hang them, most likely.  Theywere plotting murder.""They will talk at the trial.""Behind closed doors!" said Goodenough."Ahum!" said the sheikh, stroking his beard.  It would nothave been compatible with either his religion or his racialconsciousness not to try to make the utmost of the situation."This would be a bad thing for all the Christian governments ifthe tale leaked out.  Religious places have been desecrated.There would be inflammation of Moslem prejudices everywhere.""It would be worse for you!" Grim retorted.  The sheikh staredhard at him, stroking his beard again,"How so, Jimgrim?  Have I had a hand in this?""This is your famous Bir-el-Arwah, where, as you tell yourfaithful, the souls of the dead come to pray twice a week.  Thisis the gulf beneath the Rock of Abraham that you tell themreaches to the middle of the world.  Look at it!  Shall wepublish flashlight photographs?"The sheikh's eyes twinkled as he recognized the force of thatargument.  He turned it over in his mind for a full minute beforehe answered."You cannot be expected to understand spiritual things," he saidat last.  "However," looking up, "this is not under the Rock.This is another place."Goodenough pulled a compass from his pocket, but Grim shookhis head."Go on," said Grim. "What of it?""It is better to close up this place and say nothing.""Except this." Goodenough retorted:  "you will say at the firstand every succeeding opportunity that you know it is not truethat Zionists tried to blow up the Dome of the Rock.""How do I know they did not try?""Perhaps we'd better ask the Administrator to come and inspectthis place officially and put the exact facts on the record,"Goodenough retorted."You understand, don't you?" said Grim."Everything we've done until now has been strictly unofficial.There's a difference.""And this effendi?" he asked, staring at me.  "What of him?""He is commended to your special benevolence," Grim answered."The way to keep a man like him discreet is to make a friend ofhim.  Treat him as you do me, then we three shall be friends."The sheikh nodded, and that proved to be the beginning of arather intimate acquaintance with him that stood me in good steadmore than once afterwards.  The influence that a man in hisposition can exert, if he cares to, is almost beyond the beliefof those who pin their faith to money and mere officialdom.The prisoners were marched out.  All except Scharnhoff and thewoman were confirmed temporarily in the room in which Grim and Ihad breakfasted.  The woman was taken to the jail until anAmerican missionary could be found to take charge of her.  Theyalways hand the awkward cases over to Americans, partly becausethey have a gift for that sort of thing, but also because, incase of need, you can blame Americans without much risk ofa reaction.Goodenough left a guard of Sikhs outside the street entrance, tokeep out all intruders until the sheikh could collect a fewtrustworthy masons to seal up the passage again.  Grim,Scharnhoff and I walked quite leisurely to Grim's quarters, whereGrim left the two of us together in the room downstairs while hechanged into uniform."What will they do with me?" asked Scharnhoff.  He was not farfrom collapse.  He lay back in the armchair with his mouth open.I got him some of Grim's whiskey."Nothing ungenerous," I said.  "If you were going to be hangedGrim would have told you.""Do you--do you think he will let me go?""Not until he's through with you," said I, "if I'm any judgeof him.""What use can I be to him?  My life is not worth a minute'spurchase if Noureddin Ali finds me--he or that other whom theylet go.  Oh, what idiots to let Noureddin Ali give them the slip,and then to turn the second-worst one loose as well!  ThoseEnglish are all mad.  That man Grim has been corrupted by them!"Grim hardly looked corrupted, rather iron-hard and energetic whenhe returned presently in his major's uniform.  You could tell thecolor of his eyes now;  they were blue-gray, and there was alight in them that should warn the wary not to oppose him unlessa real fight was wanted.  His manner was brisk, brusk, stridingover trifles.  He nodded to me."You sick of this?" he asked me."How many times?  I want to see it through.""All right.  Your own risk."He turned on Scharnhoff, standing straight in front of him, withboth arms behind his back."Look here.  Have you any decency in that body of yours?  Do youwant to prove it?  Or would you rather hang like a commonscoundrel?  Which is it to be?""I--I--I--I--do not understand you.  What do you mean?""Are you game to risk your neck decently or would you rather havethe hangman put you out of pain?""I--I was not a conspirator, Major Grim.  If I had known whatthey intended I would never have lent myself to such a purpose.I needed money for my excavations--it has been very difficult todraw on my bank in Vienna.  Noureddin Ali represented himself tome as an enthusiastic antiquarian;  and when I spoke of my needhe offered money, as I told you already.  I never suspected untillast night that he and Abdul Ali of Damascus are French secretagents.  But last night he boasted to me about Abdul Ali.  Helaughed at me.  Then he--""Yes, yes," Grim interrupted.  "Will you play the man now, if Igive you the chance?""If you will accord me opportunity, at least I will do my best.""Understand;  you'll not be allowed to live here afterward.You'll be repatriated to Austria, or wherever you come from.All you're offered is a chance to clean your slate morally beforeyou go.""I shall be grateful.""Will you obey?""Absolutely--to the limit of my power, that is to say.  I am notan athlete--not a man of active habits.""Very well.  Listen." Grim turned to me again"Take Scharnhoff to his house.  You know the way.  When afternooncomes, set a table in the garden and let him sit at it.  He mayas well read.  If nothing happens before dark, take him out alamp and some food.  He mustn't move away.  He'd better changeinto his proper clothes first.  Your job will be to keep an eyeon him until I come.  You'd better keep out of sight as much aspossible, especially after dark.  Better watch him through thewindow.  And, by the way, take this pistol.  If Scharnhoffdisobeys you, shoot him."He turned again on Scharnhoff."I hope you're not fooling yourself.  I should say the chance istwo or three to one that you'll come out of this alive.  Ifyou're killed, you may flatter yourself that's a mighty sightcleaner than hanging.  If you come out with a whole skin, youshall leave the country without even going to jail.  Time togo now."I slipped the heavy pistol into my pocket and led the way withoutsaying a word.  Scharnhoff followed me, rather drearily, and wewalked side by side toward the German Colony, he looking exactlylike one of those respectable and devout educated Arabs of theold style, who teach from commentaries on the Koran.  We excitedno comment whatever."What will he do?  What is his purpose?" Scharnhoff asked meafter a while.  "If a man is in danger of death, he likes to knowthe reason--the purpose of it."I had a better than faint glimmering of Grim's purpose, but sawno necessity to air my views on the subject."I'm amused," said I, "at the strictly unofficial status of allthis.  You see, I'm no more connected with this administrationthan you are.  I'm as alien as you.  You might say, I'm astranger in Jerusalem.  Yet, here I am, with a perfectly officialpistol, loaded with official cartridges, under unofficial ordersto shoot you at the first sign of disobedience.  And--strictlyunofficially, between you and me--I shan't hesitate to do it!"He contrived a smile out of the depths of his despondency."I wonder--should you shoot me--what they would do toyou afterwards.""Something unofficial," I suggested. "But we'll leave that up tothem.  The point is--""Oh, don't worry!  You shall have no trouble from me."  It took along time to reach his house, for the poor old chap was sufferingfrom lack of sleep, and physical weariness, as well as disappointment,and I had to let him sit down by the wayside once or twice.  Beingin hard condition, and not much more than half his age, I had almostforgotten that I had not slept the night before.  Keen curiosity asto what might happen between now and midnight was keeping me going.He could hardly drag himself into the house.  But a bath, andsome food that I found in the larder restored him considerably.He helped me carry out the table.  He chose a book of Schiller'spoems to take with him, but did not read it;  he sat with hiselbows on the table and his back toward the front door, restinghis chin gloomily on both fists.  He remained in that attitudeall afternoon, and for all I know slept part of the time.Between him and the window of the room I sat in were some shrubsthat obscured the view considerably.  I could see Scharnhoffthrough them easily enough, but I don't think he could see me,and certainly no one could have seen me from the road.  I feltfairly sure that no one saw me until it began to grow dark and Icarried out the lamp.  Even then, it was Scharnhoff who struckthe match and lit it, so that I was in shadow all the time--probably unrecognizable.It had been fairly easy to keep awake until then, but as the roomgrew darker and darker, and nothing happened, the yearning tofall asleep became actual agony.  It was a rather large, squareroom, crowded up with a jumble of antiquities.  The only realfurniture was the window-seat on which I knelt, and an oblongtable;  but even the table was laid on its side to make room fora battered Roman bust standing on the floor between its legs.I had left the door of the room wide open, in order to be able tohear anything that might happen in the house;  but the only soundcame from a couple of rats that gnawed and rustled interminablyamong the rubbish in the corner.It must have been nearly eight o'clock, and I believe I hadactually dozed off at last, kneeling in the window, when all atonce it seemed to me that the rats were making a different, andgreater noise than I ever heard rats make.  It was pitch-blackdark.  I couldn't see my hand in front of me.  My first thoughtwas to glance through the window at Scharnhoff, but something--intuition, I suppose--made me draw aside from the window instead.Then, beyond any shadow of a doubt, I heard a man move, andthe hair rose all up the back of my head.  I rememberedthe pistol, clutched it, and found voice enough for two words:"Who's there?""Hee-hee!" came the answer from behind the table.  "So MajorJimgrim lied about a broken leg, and thought to trap NoureddinAli, did he!  Don't move, Major Jimgrim!  Don't move!  We willhave a little talk before we bid each other good-bye!  I cannotlast long in any case, for the cursed Sikhs are after me.  Iwould rather that you should kill me than those Sikhs should, butI would like to kill you also.  If you move before I give youleave you are a dead man, Major Jimgrim!  Hee-hee!  You cannotsee me!  Better keep still!"If it was flattering to be mistaken for Grim in the dark, it washardly pleasant in the circumstances.  For a moment I was angry.It flashed across my mind that Grim had planned this.  But onsecond thought I refused to believe he would deceive me aboutScharnhoff and use me as a decoy without my permission.  Idecided to keep still and see what happened."Do you think you deserve to live, Major Jimgrim?" NoureddinAli's voice went on.  I heard him shift his position.  He wasprobably trying to see my outline against the dark wall in orderto take aim.  "You, a foreigner, interfering in the politics ofthis land?  But for you there would have been an explosion todaythat would have liberated all the Moslem world.  But for that lieabout a broken leg you would have died a little after ten o'clockthis morning--hee-hee--instead of now!  Don't move, MajorJimgrim!  You and I will have a duel presently.  There is lots oftime.  The Sikhs lost track of me."I did move.  I stooped down close to the floor, so that he mightfire over my head if, as I suspected, he was merely gaining timein order to take sure aim.  I tried to see which end of the tablehe was talking from, but he was hidden completely."Do you think you should go free, to perpetrate more cowardlyinterference, after spoiling that well-laid plan?  Hee-hee!  Youpoor fool!  Busy-bodies such as you invariably overreachthemselves.  Having tricked me two or three times, you thought,didn't you? that you could draw me here to kill Scharnhoff, thatpoor old sheep.  You were careful, weren't you? to let OmarMahmoud go, in order that he might tell me how Scharnhoff hadturned witness against us.  And the Sikhs followed Omar Mahmoud,until Omar Mahmoud found me.  And then they hunted me.  Hee-hee!Don't move!  Was that the plan?  Simultaneously then, beingyourself only a fool after all, you flatter me and underestimatemy intelligence.  Hee-hee!"You were right in thinking I would not submit to capture anddeath without first wreaking vengeance.  But vengeance on such asheep as Scharnhoff?  With Major Jimgrim still alive?  Whatpossessed you?  Were you mad?  I satisfied myself an hour agothat Scharnhoff was the bait, which the redoubtable Major Jimgrimwould be watching.  Perhaps I shall deal with Scharnhoffafterwards--hee-hee!--who knows?  Now--now shall we fight thatduel?  Are you ready?"I supposed that meant that he could not see me and had given uphope of it.  He would like to have me move first, so as to judgemy exact whereabouts by sound.  I reached out very cautiously,and rapped the muzzle of my pistol on the floor twice.He fired instantly, three shots in succession.  The bullets wentwild to my left and brought down showers of plaster from thewall.  I feared he might have seen me by the pistol-flash.  I didnot fire back.  There was no need.  Something moved swiftly likea black ghost through the open door.  There was a thud--and thering of a steel swivel--and a scream."Has the sahib a match?" said a gruff voice that I thoughtI recognized.I was trembling--excitement, of course--only children and womenand foreigners ever feel afraid!  It took me half a minute tofind the match box, and the other half to strike a light.Narayan Singh was standing by the end of the table.  He waswiping blood off his bayonet with a piece of newspaper.  Helooked cool enough to have carried the paper in his pocket forthat purpose.  I got up, feeling ashamed to be seen crouching onthe floor.  But Narayan Singh smiled approval."You did well, sahib.  All men are equal in the dark.  Until hefired first there was nothing wise to do but hide.""How long have you been here?" I asked."Five minutes.  I only waited for a sure thrust.  But hah? thesahib feels like a dead man come to life again, eh?  Well I knowthat feeling!"The match burned my fingers.  I struck another.  As I did thatGrim stood in the doorway, smiling."Is he dead?" he asked."Surely, sahib.  Shall I go now and get that other one--thatOmar Mahmoud?""No need," said Grim.  "They rounded him up five minutes after hehad found Noureddin.""Then have I done all that was required of me?""No, Narayan Singh.  You haven't shaken hands with me yet.""Thank you, Jimgrim."The match went out.  I struck a third one.  Grim turned to me."Hungry?""Sleepy.""Oh, to hell with sleep!  Let's bring old Scharnhoff into theother room, dig out some eats and drinks, and get a story fromhim.  All right, Narayan Singh;  there'll be a guard here inten minutes to take charge of that body.  After that, dismiss.I'll report you to Colonel Goodenough for being a damnedgood soldier.""My colonel sahib knew that years ago," the great Sikh answeredquietly.End of Project Gutenberg's Jimgrim and Allah's Peace, by Talbot Mundy*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JIMGRIM AND ALLAH'S PEACE ******** This file should be named 11357.txt or 11357.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/3/5/11357/Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.

Helost his life in bringing off a wounded man from under the enemy's fire.For this deed, the last of many deeds as brave, he was recommended forthe Victoria Cross.__I knew him from his childhood, and on the march from Lindley toPretoria, and thence far south to Basutoland, we often rode together,and talked of West Country sport and his Devonshire home and faces thatwe both knew and loved there.__A keen soldier, a cheery comrade, and a brave and kindly Englishgentleman, he stands, it seems to me, the very type of those gallantboys who in this South African war have died for England_.PREFACEThese letters were written without any idea of publication, and it wasnot until I had been home some months that suggestions from one or twosources caused me to think of printing them. They appear much as theywere written, except that sometimes several letters dealing with thesame event have been thrown into one; and occasionally a few words havebeen added to fill up gaps. In no case have I been wise after the event,or put in prophecies which had already come off.The parts in inverted commas are extracts from note-books which I usedto carry about in my pocket, and these passages I have left just as theywere jotted down, thinking that such snap-shots of passing scenes mighthave an interest of their own.It is unlucky from a descriptive point of view that the big actions andfine effects should all have occurred during the first part of the war,leaving the dulness and monotony for the later stages. During the lastsix months of my service it was not my chance to see any importantaction, though slight skirmishing was constant, and I find thereforenothing in the later letters of a very exciting nature.Such as they are, however, these letters contain a quite faithfulaccount of things that happened under my own eyes throughout the chiefstages of the western campaign. During the early part of the war manythings happened that were splendid to see and that it gave me greatpleasure to write about. During the later stages nothing particularlysplendid occurred, though the patience and endurance of our men were intheir way fine; but some things happened which were, as we say,regrettable; and these things also are in their turn briefly described.

PLAIN MISTER!                   217WITH RIMINGTONLETTER IORANGE RIVER CAMPORANGE RIVER, _November_ 18, 1899.The sun is just rising on Orange River Camp. Our tents are pitched onthe slopes of white sand, soft and deep, into which you sink at everystep, that stretch down to the river, dotted with a few scraggythorn-trees. There are men round me, sleeping about on the sand, rolledin their dark brown blankets, like corpses laid out, covered from headto foot, with the tight folds drawn over their feet and over theirheads. A few bestir themselves, roll, and stretch, and draw back thecovering from their sleepy, dusty faces. The first sunbeams begin tocreep along the ground and turn the cold sand yellow.I am beginning this letter in the shade of a mimosa. The whole scenereminds me very much of Egypt; and you might easily believe that youwere sitting on the banks of the Nile somewhere between the first andsecond cataract. There are the same white, sandy banks, the same narrowfringe of verdure on each side, the same bareness and treelessness ofthe surrounding landscape, the same sun-scorched, stony hillocks; infact, the whole look of the place is almost identical. The river, slowand muddy, is a smaller Nile; there only wants the long snout and heavy,slug-like form of an old crocodile on the spit of sand in the middle tomake the likeness complete. And over all the big arch of the pure sky isjust the same too.Our camp grows larger and rapidly accumulates, like water behind a dam,as reinforcements muster for the attack. Methuen commands. We must beabout 8000 strong now, and are expecting almost hourly the order toadvance. Below us De Aar hums like a hive. From a deserted littlewayside junction, such as I knew it first, it has blossomed suddenlyinto a huge depot of all kinds of stores, provisions, fodder,ammunition, and all sorts of material for an important campaign. Trainskeep steaming up with more supplies or trucks crowded with khaki-cladsoldiers, or guns, khaki painted too, and the huge artillery horses thatthe Colonials admire so prodigiously. Life is at high pressure. Men talksharp and quick, and come to the point at once. Foreheads are knit andlips set with attention. Every one you see walks fast, or, if riding,canters. There is no noise or confusion, but all is strenuous, rapidpreparation.Do you know Colonials? In my eight months of mining life at JohannesburgI got to know them well. England has not got the type. The WesternStates of America have it. They are men brought up free of caste andfree of class. When you come among Colonials, forget your birth andbreeding, your ancestral acres and big income, and all those thingswhich carry such weight in England. No forelocks are pulled for themhere; they count for nothing. Are you wide-awake, sharp, and shrewd,plucky; can you lead? Then go up higher. Are you less of these things?Then go down lower. But always among these men it is a position simplyof what you are in yourself. Man to man they judge you there as youstand in your boots; nor is it very difficult, officer or trooper, orwhatever you are, to read in their blunt manners what their judgment is.It is lucky for our corps that it has in its leader a man after its ownheart; a man who, though an Imperial officer, cares very little fordiscipline or etiquette for their own sakes; who does not automaticallyassert the authority of his office, but talks face to face with his men,and asserts rather the authority of his own will and force of character.They are much more ready to knock under to the man than they would be tothe mere officer. In his case they feel that the leader by office andthe leader by nature are united, and that is just what they want.There are Colonials out here, as one has already come to see, of twotolerably distinct types. These you may roughly distinguish as themoney-making Colonials and the working Colonials. The money-making lotflourish to some extent in Kimberley, but most of all in Johannesburg.You are soon able to recognise his points and identify him at adistance. He is a little too neatly dressed and his watch-chain is alittle too much of a certainty. His manner is excessively glib andfluent, yet he has a trick of furtively glancing round while he talks,as if fearful of being overheard. For the same reason he speaks in lowtones. He must often be discussing indifferent topics, but he alwayslooks as if he were hatching a swindle. There is also a curious look ofwaxworks about his over-washed hands.This is the type that you would probably notice most. The Stock Exchangeof Johannesburg is their hatching-place and hot-bed; but from there theyoverflow freely among the seaside towns, and are usually to be found inthe big hotels and the places you would be most likely to go to. CapeTown at the present moment is flooded with them. But these are only themere froth of the South African Colonial breed. The real mass and bodyof them consists (besides tradesmen, &c., of towns) of the miners of theRand, and, more intrinsically still, of the working men and the farmersof English breed all over the Colony. It is from these that the fightingmen in this quarrel are drawn. It is from these that our corps, forinstance, has been by the Major individually and carefully recruited;and I don't think you could wish for better material, or that a body ofkeener, more loyal, and more efficient men could easily be broughttogether.Many of them are veterans, and have taken part in some of the numerousAfrican campaigns--Zulu, Basuto, Kaffir, Boer, or Matabele. They aredarkly sunburnt; lean and wiry in figure; tall often, but never fat (younever see a fat Colonial), and they have the loose, careless seat onhorseback, as if they were perfectly at home there. As scouts they havethis advantage, that they not only know the country and the Dutch andKaffir languages, but that they are accustomed, in the rough and variedcolonial life, to looking after themselves and thinking for themselves,and trusting no one else to do it for them. You can see thisself-reliance of theirs in their manner, in their gait and swagger andthe way they walk, in the easy lift and fall of the carbines on theirhips, the way they hold their heads and speak and look straight at you.Your first march with such a band is an episode that impresses itself.We were called up a few days ago at dead of night from De Aar to relievean outlying picket reported hard pressed. In great haste we saddled bymoonlight, and in a long line went winding away past the artillery linesand the white, ghostly tents of the Yorkshires. The hills in the still,sparkling moonlight looked as if chiselled out of iron, and the veldtlay spread out all white and misty; but what one thought most of was thepresence of these dark-faced, slouch-hatted irregulars, sitting free andeasy in their saddles, with the light gleaming dully on revolver andcarbine barrel. A fine thing is your first ride with a troop of fightingmen.Though called guides we are more properly scouts. Our strength is abouta hundred and fifty. A ledger is kept, in which, opposite each man'sname, is posted the part of the country familiar to him and throughwhich he is competent to act as guide. These men are often detached, andmost regiments seem to have one or two of ours with them. Sometimes aparty is detached altogether and acts with another column, and thereare always two or three with the staff. Besides acting as guides theyare interpreters, and handy men generally. All these little subtractionsreduce our main body to about a hundred, or a little less; and this mainbody, under Rimington himself, acts as scouts and ordinary fighting men.In fact, a true description of us would be "a corps of scouts supplyingguides to the army."One word about the country and I have done. What strikes one about allSouth African scenery, north and south, is the simplicity of it; so veryfew forms are employed, and they are employed over and over again. Theconstant recurrence of these few grave and simple features gives to thecountry a singularly childish look. Egyptian art, with its mechanicalrepetitions, unchanged and unvaried, has just the same character. Bothare intensely pre-Raphaelite.South Africa's only idea of a hill, for instance, is the pyramid. Thereare about three different kinds of pyramid, and these are reproducedagain and again, as if they were kept all ready made in a box like toys.There is the simple kopje or cone, not to be distinguished at a littledistance from the constructed pyramids of Egypt, just as regular andperfect. Then there is the truncated or flat-topped pyramid, used formaking ranges; and finally the hollow-sided one, a very pretty andgraceful variety, with curving sides drooping to the plain. These areall. Of course there are a few mistakes. Some of the hills are rathershakily turned out, and now and then a kopje has fallen away, as itwere, in the making. But still the central idea, the type they all tryfor, is always perfectly clear. Moreover, they all are, or are meant tobe, of exactly the same height.Most strange and weird is this extraordinary regularity. It seems tomean something, to be arranged on some plan and for some humanlyintelligible purpose. In the evenings and early mornings especially,when these oft-repeated shapes stand solemnly round the horizon, cuthard and blue against the sky like the mighty pylons and propylons ofEgyptian temples, the architectural character of the scenery and itsdefinite meaning and purpose strike one most inevitably. So solemn andsad it looks; the endless plains bare and vacant, and the groups of purecut battlements and towers. As if some colossals here inhabited at onetime and built these remains among which we now creep ignorant of theirtrue character. The scenery really needs such a race of Titans to matchit. In these spaces we little fellows are lost.Well, farewell. My next will be after some sort of a contest. There hasbeen a touch or two; enough to show they are waiting for us. A corporalof ours was shot through the arm yesterday and struggled back to camp onanother man's horse. The dark-soaked sleeve (war's colour for the firsttime of seeing!) was the object, you may guess, of particular attention.LETTER IIBELMONTBELMONT SIDING.It is to be called Belmont, I believe, from the little siding on therailway near which it was fought. On the other hand it may be calledafter the farm which it was fought on. Who decides these things? I havenever had dealings with a battle in its callow and unbaptized daysbefore, and it had never occurred to me that they did not come into theworld ready christened. Will Methuen decide the point, or the warcorrespondents, or will they hold a cabinet council about it? AnyhowBelmont will do for the present.What happened was the simplest thing in the world. The Boers took uptheir position in some kopjes in our line of march. The Britishinfantry, without bothering to wait till the hills had been shelled,walked up and kicked the Boers out. There was no attempt at any plan orscheme of action at all; no beastly strategy, or tactics, or outlandishtricks of any sort; nothing but an honest, straightforward British marchup to a row of waiting rifles. Our loss was about 250 killed andwounded. The Boer loss, though the extent of it is unknown, was probablycomparatively slight, as they got away before our infantry came fairlyinto touch with them. The action is described as a victory, and so, in asense, it is; but it is not the sort of victory we should like to haveevery day of the week. We carried the position, but they hit us hardest.On the whole, probably both sides are fairly satisfied, which must berare in battles and is very gratifying.Our mounted men, Guides, 9th Lancers, and a few Mounted Infantry,marched out an hour before dawn. A line of kopjes stood up before us,rising out of the bare plain like islands out of the sea, and as werounded the point and opened up the inner semicircle of hills, we coulddistinguish the white waggon tops of the Boer laager in a deep niche inthe hillside, and see the men collecting and mounting and gallopingabout. By-and-by, as we advanced, there came a singing noise, andsuddenly a great pillar of red dust shot up out of the ground a littleto our left. "That's a most extraordinary thing," thinks I, deeplyinterested, "what land whale of these plains blows sand up in thatfashion?" Then I saw several heads turned in that direction, and heardsome one say something about a shell, and finally I succeeded ingrasping, not without a thrill, the meaning of the phenomenon.The infantry attack came off on the opposite side of the ridge fromwhere we were, and we could see nothing of it. But we heard. As we drewalongside of the hills, suddenly there broke out a low, quickly utteredsound; dull reports so rapid as to make a rippling noise. The day wasbeautifully fine, still, and hot. There was no smoke or movement of anykind along the rocky hill crest, and yet the whole place was throbbingwith Mausers. This was the first time that any of us had listened tomodern rifle fire. It was delivered at our infantry, who on that sidewere closing with their enemy.The fire did not last long, though in the short time it did terribledamage, and men of the Northumberlands and Grenadiers and Coldstreamswere dropping fast as they clambered up the rocky hillside. But thatbrief burst of firing was the battle of Belmont. In that little space oftime the position had been lost and won, and we had paid our price forit. During the march across the flat, as I have been told since, ourloss was comparatively light; but when the climbing of the hill began,numbers of Boers who had been waiting ready poured in their fire. Allalong the ridge, from behind every rock and stone, the smokeless Mauserscracked (it was then the fire rose to that rippling noise we werelistening to on the other side of the range), and the sleet of bullets,slanting down the hill, swept our fellows down by scores. But there wasnever any faltering. They had been told to take the hill. Two hundredand fifty stopped on the way through no fault of theirs. The rest wenton and took it. That's the way our British infantry put a job through.Soon, on our side, scattered bands of the enemy began to emerge from thekopjes and gallop north, whilst right up at the top of the valley theirlong convoy of waggons came into view, trekking away as hard as theycould go, partly obscured by clouds of dust. We made some attempts tostop them, but our numbers were too few. Though defeated, they were notin any way demoralised, and the cool way in which they turned to meetus showed that they knew they were safe from the infantry, and did notfear our very weak cavalry. We did not venture to press the matterbeyond long shots. Had we done so, it was evident we should have beencut up.Various little incidents occurred. This one amused me at the moment. Wehad captured a herd of cattle from some niggers who had been sent by theBoers to drive them in, and I was conveying them to the rear. From agroup of staff officers a boy came across the veldt to me, and presentlyI heard, as I was "shooing" on my bullocks, a very dejected voiceexclaim, "How confoundedly disappointing." I looked round and saw a ladgazing ruefully at me, with a new revolver tied to a bright yellowlanyard ready in his hand. "I thought you were a Boer," he said, "and Iwas going to shoot you. I've _got leave_ to shoot you," he added, asthough he were in two minds about doing the job anyway. I looked at himfor a long while in silence, there seemed nothing to say, and then,still ruefully, he rode away. This, you will understand, was right upour end of the valley, and I was driving cattle on to our ground, only Ihad a soft hat on.We have plenty of youngsters like this; brave, no doubt, but thoughtlessand quite careless about the dangerous qualities of the men they have tomeet. "They'll live and learn," people say. They'll learn if they live,would perhaps be nearer the mark. The Boers, on the other hand, such asI have seen yet, are decidedly awkward-looking customers, crafty, butin deadly earnest, versed in veldt wars and knowing the country to ananthill. Looking from one to the other, I fear there are many mothers inEngland who'll go crying for their boys this campaign.Later a troop of us penetrated into the deep recess among the hillswhere they had their laager. It seemed evident, from the number ofwaggons and the amount of clothing and stores left behind and litteredin every direction, that the Boers had not expected to be shifted nearlyso suddenly as they were. There were heaps of provisions, quantities ofcoffee tied up in small bags, sugar, rice, biltong, _i.e._ dried stripsof flesh, a sort of bread biscuit much used by them on the march, andmade at the farms, and other things. All were done up in smallquantities in such a way that individual men could carry it. There werewaggons loaded, or half loaded, with old chests and boxes, and manyheaped about the ground. Most contained clothes, and the place wasstrewn in all directions with blankets, greatcoats, and garments of allsorts, colours, and sizes. I annexed a very excellent black mackintosh,quite new and splendidly lined with red; a very martial and imposinggarment.Diligent search was made for any paper or memoranda, which might showthe plans or strength of the enemy, but all we found were thelove-letters of the young Boers, of which there were vast numbers,extremely amusing. It never seems to have occurred to any of the writersthat they could be going to get the worst of it. They seem to put theresponsibility for the management of the whole campaign into the handsof the Deity. They are religious but practical. "God will protect us.Here is a pound of coffee," is about what they all come to. It is thefashion to scoff at the calm way in which our enemies have appropriatedthe services of the Almighty, but all the same it shows a dangeroustemper. People who believe they have formed this alliance have alwaysbeen difficult to beat. You remember Macaulay's Puritan, with his "Biblein one hand and a two-edged sword in the other." The sword has givenplace to a Mauser now, but I am not sure that we are likely to benefitmuch by the change. As to the Bible, it is still very much in evidence.Not a single kit but contained one; usually the family one in old brownleather. Now it is an historical fact that Bible-reading adversaries arevery awkward customers to tackle, and remembering that, I dislike theseBibles.More practically important than love-letters and Bibles, we found also alot of abandoned ammunition, shell and Mauser. Our ambulance partieswere at work in the hills. Several Boers, as they fled, had been shotdown near the laager. We found one, shot through the thigh, groaningvery much, and carried him into the shade of a waggon, and did what wecould for him. Meantime some of us had gathered bits of boxes and wood,and made a fire and boiled water. Tea-cups, coffee, sugar, and biscuitswere found, and we made a splendid feast in the midst of the desolation.Horrid, you will say, to think of food among the dead and wounded. Andyet that coffee certainly was very good. Somehow I believe the Boersunderstand roasting it better than we do.Before going we collected all the ammunition and heaped it together andmade a pile of wood round it which we set ablaze and then drew out intothe plain and reined in and looked back. Never shall I forget the view.The hills, those hills the English infantry had carried so splendidly,were between us and the now setting sun, and though so close were almostblack with clean-hacked edges against the sunset side of the sky. Toeastward the endless grassy sea went whitening to the horizon, crossedin the distance with the horizontal lines of rich brown and yellow andpure blue, which at sunrise and sunset give such marvellous colouring tothe veldt. The air here is exactly like the desert air, veryexhilarating to breathe and giving to everything it touches thatwonderful clearness and refinement which people who have been brought upin a damp climate and among smudged outlines so often mistake forhardness. Our great ammunition fire in the hollow of the hill burnedmerrily, and by-and-by a furious splutter of Mauser cartridges began,with every now and then the louder report of shells and great smokeballs hanging in the air. But sheer above all, above yellow veldt andruined Boer laager, rose the hill, the position we had carried, grim andrigid against the sunset and all black. And, with the sudden sense of_seeing_ that comes to one now and then, I stared at it for a while andsaid out loud "Belmont!" And in that aspect it remains photographed inmy memory.LETTER IIIGRASPAN_November_ 26, 1899.We marched out from our Orange River Camp on November 22nd, and foughtat Belmont on the 23rd. On the 24th we marched north again, and on the25th (yesterday) fought another action at Graspan, or, as some call it,Enslin--there is still the difficulty about names. March a day and fighta day seems the rule so far.At home, when you are criticising these actions of Methuen, you mustalways bear two facts in mind. First, we are bound to keep our line ofcommunication, that is, the railway, open, and hold it as we advance. Wecan bring Kimberley no relief unless we can open and guard the railway,and so enable supplies to be poured into the town. Second, we are notstrong enough, and above all not mobile enough, while holding therailway to attempt a wide flanking movement which might threaten theBoer retreat, or enable us to shell and attack from two sides at once.If we had anything like a decent force of mounted men I suppose we coulddo it, but with our handful to separate it from the main body would beto get it cut off. "Want of frigates" was to be found on Nelson's heart,as he said on some occasion, and I am sure by this time that "want ofcavalry" must be written on poor Methuen's. So you must figure toyourself a small army, an army almost all infantry, and an army tied tothe railway on this march; and if we bring off no brilliant strategy,but simply plod on and take hard knocks, well, what else, I ask, underthe circumstances can we do?Yesterday in the early morning we found ourselves emerging from somestony hills with a great plain before us about four miles wide, I shouldthink, with an ugly-looking range of hills bounding it on the north andthe railway running north and south on our left. This we had everyreason to believe was the enemy's position; toll-gate No. 2 on theKimberley road. We went on to reconnoitre. Rimington led us straighttowards the hills in open order, and when we were somewhere about riflerange from them, we right turned and galloped in line along their front;but no gun or rifle spoke. When we reached the eastern point of therange, we turned it and rode on with the hills on our left; and now,with the Lancers a little farther out on our right, we offered too gooda shot for the enemy to resist. They opened on us with, as I thoughtthree, but others think two, guns, and put in some quick andwell-directed shots, of which the first one or two fell short and therest went screaming over our heads and fell among the Lancers.One point of difference, I notice, so far as a short experience goes,between cavalry and infantry, which is all in favour of the cavalry; andthat is, that when they get into fire the infantry go calmly on, whilethe much wiser cavalry generally run away. We retired from these guns,but when opposite the corner of the range the Lancers got on to somebad ground in front of us, and we had to halt a minute, which gave theBoer Long Tom an excellent chance of a few parting words with us. Thefirst shell came along, making the mad noise they do, whooping andscreaming to itself, and plunged into the ground with a loud snort onlyabout thirty or forty yards off. The gunner, having got his range, wasnot long in sending down another, and when the white curl of smokeappeared lying again on the hillside, one guessed that the individualnow on his way would prove a warmish customer. It burst with a mostalmighty crack, and I involuntarily bent down my head over my horse'sneck. "Right over your head," shouted the next man, in answer to myquestion as to where it burst.If you are at all interested in "projectiles," you may care to hear thatshrapnel is most effective when it bursts over, but a little short of,the object aimed at; the bullets, released by the bursting charge,continuing the line of flight of the shell, which is a downward slant.There is a rather anxious interval, of about ten or fifteen secondsgenerally after you see the smoke of the gun, and before anything elsehappens. Then comes the hollow boom of the report, and almostimmediately afterwards the noise of the shell, growing rapidly from awhimper to a loud scream, with a sudden note of recognition at the end,as if it had caught sight of and were pouncing on you. It is a curiousfact, however, that, in spite of the noise they make, you cannot in theleast distinguish in which direction they are coming. You find yourselflooking vaguely round, wondering where this yelling devil is going toground, but till you see the great spurt of earth you have no idea whereit will be. We came back across the plain, having more or less locatedthe position and the guns. Rimington with one squadron got into a tightplace among some kopjes on our right. The rifle fire was very hot, andat close range. The Major took up his orderly, whose horse was shot, onhis own pony, and brought him off. For a moment the squadron came undercover of a hill, but they had to run the gauntlet of the Boer fire toget away. Rimington laughingly asked for a start as his pony wascarrying double, and rode first out into the storm of bullets. Severalmen and horses were hit, but no men killed, and they were lucky ingetting off as cheap as they did. We then drew back to a cattle kraal onthe slope overlooking the plain, from which we watched the developmentof the infantry attack.I usually carry a note-book and pencil in my pocket, partly to jot downany information one may pick up at farms from Kaffirs, &c., and partlyto make notes in of the things I see. Here is a note from the kraal."10 A.M.--There is a wide plain in front of me, four miles across, flatas the sea, and all along the farther side a line of kopjes and hillsrising like reefs and detached islands out of it. You might think theplain was empty at first glance, but, if you look hard, you will see itcrawling with little khaki-clad figures, dotted all over it; not packedanywhere, but sprinkled over the whole surface. They are steadily butvery leisurely converging on the largest end hill of the opposite range.Meantime, from three or four spots along the sides of those hills, locksand puffs of white smoke float out, followed at long intervals by deep,sonorous reports; and if you look to the left a bit, where our navalguns are at work, you will see the Boer shells bursting close to or overthem. The artillery duet goes on between the two, while still theinfantry, unmolested as yet, crawls and crawls towards those hills."This is our first sight of an infantry attack, and it doesn't impress meat first at all. Its cold-bloodedness, the absence of all excitement,make it so different from one's usual notions of a battle. It is reallydifficult to believe that those little, sauntering figures are"delivering an attack." They don't look a bit as if they were going tofight. The fact is, they have a long distance to cover before reachingthe hills, and must go fairly slow. Accordingly, you see them strollingleisurely along as if nothing particular were happening; while the hillsthemselves, except for the occasional puffs of smoke, look; quite bareand empty; ridges of stone and rock, interspersed with grass tussocks,heaped up against the hot, blue sky.But now, as they advance farther across the plain, the muffled,significant sound of the Mauser fire begins. The front of the attack isalready so far across that it is impossible to see how they are faringfrom here; but it is evident that our shell fire, heavy though it hasbeen, for all our guns have been in action some time now, has not turnedthe Boers out of their position. The big chunks of rock are anexcellent defence against shrapnel, and behind them they lie, or down inthe hollow of the hills, as we saw them earlier in the day, to be calledup when the attack approached; and now, gathering along the crest, theirfire quickens gradually from single shots to a roar. But it has noeffect on that fatal sauntering! Of the men who leave this side nigh ontwo hundred will drop before they reach the other, but still, neitherhurrying nor pausing, on they quietly stroll, giving one, in theiruniform motion over that wide plain, a sense as of the force andimplacability of some tidal movement. And, as you watch, thesignificance of it all grows on you, and you see that it is just itsvery cold-bloodedness and the absence of any dash and fury that makesthe modern infantry attack such a supreme test of courage.Of the details of the attack, when it came to the last charge, we couldsee nothing. The Naval Brigade, who had the hardest part of the positionto take, lost terribly, but did the job in a way that every one says wasperfectly splendid. It is said, however, that they made the mistake, inthe scaling of the hill, of closing together, and so offering a morecompact mass to the enemy's fire. We came on behind the infantry withour friends the Lancers, and passed through a gap in the range and onacross some open ground and through a few more kopjes as fast as wecould go. Then we came in sight of the enemy, and the same thinghappened as at Belmont. A lot of horsemen, enough to have eaten us up,that were hanging about the rear of the Boer column, came wheeling outagainst us, and as we continued to approach, opened fire. Luckily therewas good cover for our ponies behind some hillocks, and, leaving themthere, we crawled out among the rocks and blazed at the Boers. But thiswas all we could do. We daren't attack. The only hope was guns, and itwas a long and inexplicable time before any guns came up. By that timethe Boer column was almost across the plain, winding its way in amongthe kopjes on the farther side, but the 15-pounders made some verypretty practice at the rear-guard, and considerably hastened theirmovements. The Boer retreat seems to have been conducted with muchcoolness and method. They ceased firing their big guns while the attackwas still a good way distant, and limbered up and sent them on, theriflemen remaining till the attack was close upon them, and firing theirlast shots right in our infantry's faces, then rushing down to theirhorses and mounting and galloping off. No doubt, they exposed themselvesa bit in doing this, but pumped and excited men can't be expected toshoot very straight, and I'm afraid their losses were light compared toours. They have now retired, we presume, to the next range of kopjes,there to smoke their pipes and read their Bibles and await our coming. Isuppose we shall be along to-morrow or next day.LETTER IVMODDER RIVERMODDER RIVER CAMP,_December 1_, 1899.We had a great old fight here two days ago, and suffered anothercrushing victory; but though I saw it all, I daresay you know more aboutthe whole thing by this time than I do.This is Modder River, deep and still, just beneath my feet. It is alovely, cloudless morning, and going to be a very hot day. I am writingmy letter on the banks of the river in the shade of green trees andshrubs, with birds singing and twittering, and building their nestsround me; it is spring-time here, you know, or early summer. Here andthere, sauntering or sitting, are groups of our khaki soldiers enjoyingmightily a good rest after the hard work, marching and fighting, of thelast ten days. From the river-bed come voices calling and talking,sounds of laughing, and now and then a plunge. Heads bob about andsplash in the mud-coloured water, and white figures run down the bankand stand a moment, poised for a plunge. Three stiff fights in sevendays doesn't seem to have taken much of the spring out of them.You would scarcely think it was the scene of a battle, and yet there area few signs. If you look along the trees and bushes, you see here andthere a bough splintered or a whole trunk shattered, as though it hadbeen struck by lightning. A little lower down the river there is a shedof corrugated iron, which looks as if some one had been trying to turnit into a pepper-pot by punching it all over with small holes. They runa score to the square foot, and are a mark of attention on the part ofour guards, who, lying down over yonder in the plain, could plainlydistinguish the light-coloured building and made a target of it. In manyplaces the ground is ploughed up in a curious way, and all about in thedust lie oblong cylinders of metal, steel tubes with a brass band roundone end. These would puzzle you. They are empty shell cases. The tops,as you see, have been blown off, which is done by the bursting chargetimed by a fuse to ignite at a certain range, _i.e._, above and a littleshort of the object aimed at. The explosion of the bursting charge bythe recoil, checks for an instant the flight of the shell, and thisinstant's check has the effect of releasing the bullets with which thecase is filled. These fly forward with the original motion and impetusof the shell itself, spreading as they go. Horizontal fire is easy tofind cover against, but these discharges from on high are much moredifficult to evade. For instance, ant-hills are excellent cover againstrifles, but none at all against these shells. It is shrapnel, as thiskind of shell is called, that does the most mischief. The round bullets(200 to a caseful) lie scattered about in the dust, and mixed with themare very different little slender silvery missiles, quite pretty anddelicate, like jewellers' ornaments. These are Lee-Metford bullets. Youcould pick up a pocketful in a short time.The action itself was mainly an infantry one. Here are one or twojottings taken that day:--"_November 26th_, 7.30 A.M.--We left camp, six miles south of ModderRiver, a little before daylight and marched north. The country is likewhat one imagines a North American prairie to be, a sea of whitish,coarse grass, with here and there a low clump of bushes (behind one ofwhich we are halted as I write this). One can see a vast distance overthe surface. Along the north horizon there is a ripple of small hillsand kopjes, looking blue, with the white grass-land running up to them.It is a comparatively cool morning with a few light clouds in the skyand a pleasant breeze. On our left is the railway, and all along on ourright, extending far in front and far behind, advances the army.""We incline to the left near to the railway. The horrid, little,grey-bluish, armoured train crawls in front. It is dreadfully excitedalways in presence of the enemy, darting forward and then running backlike a scorpion when you tease it with your stick-end. One can see byits agitation this morning that the enemy are not far off. Behind itcomes a train of open trucks with the famous Naval Brigade, with theirguns, search-light, &c. The river flows somewhere across the landscapeyonder in the plains. One cannot see it, but a few belts of bushesindicate its course. It is just that awkward moment before one getstouch of the enemy. They, no doubt, can see us (I wonder how they likethe look of us), but we cannot see them. They must be somewhere alongthe river among those bushes, and probably in trenches. But where doestheir main strength lie? where are their guns? There goes fire, away onthe right (probably at the Lancers, who are the right flankers); thedull short discharge of Mausers. The train moves forward a hundredyards, but as yet the men keep their places, clustered in the trucks.Two officers standing on a carriage roof watch with a telescope thedistant fire. It has now ceased. A flag-wagger flutters his flag ineager question. Nothing moves on the plain save here and there a lonelyprowling horseman, cantering on, or dismounted and peering through hisglass. It was three minutes to eight when the first shot was fired.'This will be a bit more history for the kiddies to learn,' yawns thenext man to me, leaning idly over his pony.""It is a half-hour later as the great guns begin their booming; thatsolemn, deep-toned sound like the striking of a great cathedral clock.We moved forward to the top of a rise overlooking the distant river andvillage.""A dead level stretches below us to the river, marked by some bush tuftsand the few roofs of Modder River village. The Naval Brigade have gottheir four guns in the plain just near the foot of our hill. They arehard at work now bombarding the enemy's big gun by the river. This,after a while, is almost silenced. Each time it speaks again the deadlynaval guns are on to it. At last, when it does fire, it shows by itserratic aim that its best gunners are out of action.""9.30.--The naval guns draw slowly closer to the river. Every shellbursts along the opposite bank where the enemy are. More to the rightand nearer the river our field-batteries are pounding away as hard asthey can load and fire. All the time the subdued rumble of Maxims andrifles goes on, like a rumble of cart-wheels over a stony road. Now itincreases to one continuous roar, now slackens till the reportsseparate. Now, after one and a half hours, the fight seems to beconcentrating towards the village opposite. A haze of smoke hangs overthe place. The guns thunder. The enemy's Maxim-Nordenfelt goesrat-tat-tat a dozen times with immense rapidity. 'Come in,' says a Tommyof the Grenadiers who has come to our hill for orders; and indeed itsounds exactly like some one knocking at a street door. Now theunder-current of rifle fire becomes horrible in its rapidity. Cananything in that hell down there be left alive? Suddenly their pluckybig gun opens again and sends several well-directed shells among ourbatteries. The naval guns turn their attention to it immediately. Youcan see the little, quick glints of fire low along the ground at eachdischarge, and then the bursting shell just over the big gun on theriver-bank.""10 A.M.--Both sides are sticking to the business desperately. Therattle of rifle-fire is one low roar. The air shudders and vibratesunder it. Now the naval guns draw towards the river again; so do therest of our batteries. Things can't stand at this tension. The big gunspeaks again, but wildly; its shell bursts far out on the plain.""10.30.--The aspect of the place is now awful. The breeze has died alittle and the smoke hangs more. It is enveloped in a haze of yellow andblue vapour, partly from bursting shell and partly firing guns. Thosevolumes of smoke, with gleams of fire every now and then, make it looklike some busy manufacturing town, and the blows and throbs with whichthe place resounds convey the same idea.""11 A.M.--The fight is dogged as ever but slower. There are cessationsof firing altogether, and it is comparatively slow when continued. Thestubbornness of the enemies' resistance to our attack and to the fearfulshelling they have had is calling forth expressions of astonishment andadmiration from the onlooking officers on the hill.""As the circle narrowed and our attack concentrated on the village andbridge, we all thought that the end was coming, and, on a lull of thefiring about 11.30 the Major even exclaimed, 'There, I think that's theend, and I can only say thank God for it.' But he was wrong. He hadscarcely said it when that indomitable heavy gun of theirs, re-suppliedwith gunners, began again; again the Naval guns, on a tested range,crack their shrapnel right in its face; the batteries all open and soonthe whole orchestra is thundering again. That dreadful muttering, the'rub-a-dub, a-dub-a-dub, a-dub-a-dub' (say it as fast as you can) of therifles keeps on; through all the noise of fire, the sharp, quick bark ofthe Boer Maxim-Nordenfelt sounds at intervals and the mingled smoke anddust lies in a haze along the river."It was, all through, almost entirely an infantry action, but about themiddle of the day we were sent down to the river on the Boer right, asparties of the enemy were thought to be breaking away in that direction.And here, I am sorry to say, poor Parker who had served in theGreek-Turkish war, and used to beguile our long night marches withstories of the Thessalian hills and the courage of the Turks, was hit,it is feared mortally. The fight itself continued with intermissions allday, and even in the evening, though parts of the Boer position had beencaptured and many of them had fled, there were some who still made goodtheir defence, holding out in places of vantage with the greatestobstinacy. These took advantage of the night to escape, and it was nottill next morning that we had the place in our possession. The Boersthemselves, as we are told by people here, thought the positionimpregnable. Certainly it was very strong. The river has cut a channelor groove thirty feet deep in the ground; the edges, sharp and distinct,so that men can lie on the slant and look out across the plain. A bigloop in the river is subtended by a line of trenches and rifle-pitshastily dug (they only decided twenty-four hours before the attack todefend the position; this by Cronje's advice, who had just come southfrom Mafeking, the others were for retiring to the next range of hills),from which the whole advance of our infantry across the level iscommanded. "We," as the soldiers explained to me, "could see nothing inour front but a lot of little heads popping up to fire and then poppingdown again." These shelters, a long line of them, are littered thickwith empty cartridge cases, hundreds in each; one thinks involuntarilyof grouse-driving. Bodies, still unburied, lay about when I was there.Such odours! such sights! The unimaginable things that the force of shotand shell can do to poor, soft, human flesh. I saw soldiers who hadhelped to do the work turn from those trenches shaking.LETTER VTHE FOUR POINT SEVENMODDER RIVER CAMP,_December_ 1899.A few days ago we welcomed a distinguished stranger here in the shape ofa long 4.7 naval gun. They set him up in the road just outside thestation, with his flat-hatted sailors in zealous attendance, where heheld a day-long levee. The gun is a remarkable object among the rest ofour artillery. Its barrel, immensely long but very slender, has awell-bred, aristocratic look compared with the thick noses of ourfield-guns. It drives its forty-five pound shell about seven miles, andshoots, I am told, with perfect accuracy. It is an enlarged edition ofthe beautiful little twelve-pounders which we have hitherto been using,and which exceed the range of our fifteen-pounder field-guns by about ahalf. Why should naval guns be so vastly superior to land ones?I interviewed the sailors on the accomplishments of the new-comer, andon the effects especially of lyddite, about which we hear so much. Onemust allow for a little friendly exaggeration, but if the mixture oftruth is in any decent proportion, I should say that spades to bury deadBoers with are all the weapons that the rest of us will require infuture. The gun uses shrapnel as well, but relies for its main effectson lyddite. As for this horrible contrivance, all I can say is that theGeneva Conference ought to interdict it. The effects of the explosion ofa lyddite shell are as follows:--Any one within 50 yards is obliterated,blown clean away. From 50 to 100 yards they are killed by the force ofthe concussion of the air. From 100 to 150 yards they are killed by thefumes or poisonous gases which the shell ex-hales. From 150 to 200 theyare not killed, but knocked senseless, and their skin is turned to abrilliant green colour. From 200 to 250 they are so dazed and stupefiedas to be incapable of action, and, generally speaking, after that anyone in the district or neighbourhood of the shock is "never the same managain." This is no mere rumour, for I have it direct from the navalgunners themselves.This morning, well before light, we took out our gentleman, dragged byan immense string of oxen, to introduce him to his future victims andwhet his appetite by a taste. The Boer position lies some six miles tothe north of the river. The most conspicuous feature of it is a hillprojecting towards us like a ship's ram and dipping sharply to theplain. Magersfontein, they call it. The railway going north leaves it tothe right, but other hills and kopjes carry on the position westwardacross the railway, barring an advance. It is evident that we shall haveto take the place in front, as we are not strong enough nor mobileenough to go round.We have a few reinforcements, notably the Highland Brigade, also the12th Lancers under Airlie, and some Horse Artillery pop-guns.There is a good deal of bush on the plain, especially to the right ofthe steep hill, where it is quite thick. During the last week we havebeen poking about in this a good deal, approaching the hill now on thisside, now on that, under cover of the scrub, examining and searching,but with very little result. They keep themselves well hidden. The hillslook untenanted except that now and then we have seen parties of Boerswending their way in between the kopjes and driving in herds of cattle.In the thick bush on the eastern plain, as we lay one morning atdaybreak, we could hear the shouts of men and catch glimpses of themhere and there riding about and urging their cattle on. Some passed notfar from where we lay crouched (we had left our ponies on the outskirtsof the bush). It seemed funny to watch them riding to and fro,unconscious of our presence and calling to each other. It reminded me ofsome boy's game of hide-and-seek or Tom Tiddler's ground. We have hadtwo or three casualties, and lost two prisoners, and we have baggedseveral of them. The army is resting.Well, this morning, as I was saying, we take our Long Tom (Joey, as heis now called, out of compliment to Chamberlain) out for a shot. Here isa note about it:--"4.30 A.M.--Our little groups of horse, in threes and fours, areclustered behind bushes. There is a whispered consultation round ourlarge gun and his nose slowly rises. The jerk of the lanyard is followedby a frightful explosion and then comes the soaring noise of the flyingshell and the red spark and column of dust on the kopje. The range hasbeen well judged, for the first shot falls with beautiful accuracy juston the hill where they are supposed to be."It is worth getting up at this time to enjoy the delicious, pure, andfresh air. The glow of sunrise is in the sky, but not yet the sun. Thereare some long streaks and films of rosy cloud along the east. Already,after five shots, the whole kopje is enveloped in dust and reddish smokefrom the bursting lyddite, but elsewhere between us and the sunrise thehills are a perfect dark blue, pure blocks of the colour. The Lancers ontheir horses show black against the sky as they canter, scatteringthrough the underwood with graceful slanting lances. At slow deliberateintervals the long gun tolls. Dead silence is the only reply. The sunrises and glares on the rocky hills. Not a living thing is to be seen."LETTER VIMAGERSFONTEINMODDER RIVER CAMP,_December 13_, 1899.When we were camped a day's march south of this, two Boers brought in awounded man of ours in a Cape cart. "You will never get to Kimberley,"they said to us. "It will take better men than you to stop us," said we."Not a bit of it," said they, and off they drove. As it turns out, theywere nearer the mark than we were.While I write this, early on the morning of the 13th, you at home mayjust be reading in the papers the accounts of our last two days'disastrous fighting. It was a defeat, but yet it was a defeat which wasnot felt nor realised by the bulk of the army. It was a blow that fellentirely on one brigade, and the greater part of our force was stillawaiting the order to advance, and expecting to engage the enemy whenalready the attack, unknown to us, had been delivered and repulsed.Last Sunday, December 10th, about 2 P.M., we moved out of camp northwardtowards the point of the big hill, that, like a cape, juts south intothe plain. With all our guns ranged about the point of the hill, we thenproceeded to thrash and batter it with shell-fire. No gun-fire that wehave had as yet has approached this for rapidity. The batteries roaredceaselessly from the plain; the big 4.7 lifting up its voice from alittle in the rear high above the din. The day was cloudy, and rain fellat intervals, but towards the evening it cleared. My troop was on theextreme left front, on the west side of the hill, and we had a fine viewof the effect as the shells burst one after another, or sometimes threeor four together, all along the hill flank, up on the crest, or in theplain along the base."5 P.M.--The hill is all one heavy dull hue in the sombre evening light,and against it the sharp glints of fire as the shrapnel bursts, and theround puff-balls of white smoke show vividly. Every now and then a greatcurtain of murky vapour goes up to show where the old lyddite-slinger inthe rear is depositing his contributions. We had three field-batteriesengaged, the naval twelve-pounders, Joey, and the pop-guns; about thirtyguns altogether."We slept that night by the side of the railway, tethering our horses tothe wire fence that runs down it. Rain fell heavily all night. Most ofus had no blankets, and we lay bundled up, shivering under ourgreatcoats on the sopping ground. Unable to sleep well, I heard, justabout or before dawn, a distant drumming, like the noise of rain on thewindow, but recognised immediately as distant rifle-fire. Morning broke,cheerless and wet. I asked if any one had heard firing during the night,but no one near me had. Shivering and breakfastless, save for a morselof biscuit and a sip of muddy water, we saddle our dripping horses andfall in. A Tommy sitting in the ditch, the picture of misery; cold, andhungry, with the rain trickling from his sodden helmet on to his face;breaks into a hymn, of which the first verse runs:--    "There is a happy land      Far, far away,    Where they get ham and eggs      Three times a day."I find myself dwelling on the words as we move off. Can there be such aland? Can there be so blessed a place?We reach the ganger's hut, and the light spreads and rests on the hills.Immediately we are deafened by a shattering report close behind us, andstarting round, find the long nose of Joey projecting almost over ourheads, while the scream of the shell dies away in the distance as itspeeds towards the Boer hill. One of the naval officers gives me a firsthint of the truth. There has certainly been an attack, he says, but hefears unsuccessful.We took the matter up, then, where we left off yesterday, all ourbatteries coming into action and shelling the hills most furiously. Theenemy replied with three guns only, but so well placed were they that wefound it impossible to silence them. While our fire was concentrated onto any one of them, it would remain silent, but, after a short interval,would always begin again, to the rage of our gunners. There isespecially a big gun of theirs in a fold of the hill just at the crest,between which and "Joey" exist terms of mortal defiance. Nothing else itappears can touch either of them; so while the lesser cannonade rages inthe middle, these two lordly creatures have a duel of their own andexchange the compliments of the season with great dignity anddeliberation over the others' heads. It has gone all in favour of "Joey"while I was watching, the Boer gun being rather erratic and most of itsshells falling short. It made one good shot just in front of us, and itwas really comic to see how "Joey," who had been looking for otheradversaries for the moment, came swinging round at the voice of hisdearest foe. The explosion of the big gun almost knocks one backwards,and I feel the sudden pressure on my ears of the concussion.Later in the day "Joey" and I got quite thick. There is a double kopje,detached from the main Boer position on our side, known as the DumbellKopje. From our left-front place we could see a lot of Boers clusteredunder the hill, pasted, like swarming bees, up against the lee of it,while the naval gun's shells--for he evidently had a nonchalant ideathat there was some one about there--went flying overhead and burstingbeyond. This was very irritating to watch, and I was glad to be sentback to "whisper a word in his ear." Making a hasty sketch of the hill,I galloped back and presented it to the captain with explanation, andhad the satisfaction of seeing 300 yards knocked off "Joey's" next shot,which was, I should judge, a very hot one. "Stay and have some grub,"said the jolly naval captain. We sat on the ground eating and drinking,while "Joey" peppered the Dutchmen.As for the fight itself, people seem inclined to make a great mysteryabout it and talk about "the difficulty of getting at the truth;" but Idon't see myself where the mystery comes in. What happened was this. TheHighland Brigade (Black Watch, Seaforths, Argyle and Sutherlands, andHighland Light Infantry) was told off for the night attack and marchedbefore light to the hill. The night was very dark and heavy rainfalling. The ground was rough, stony, and rocky, with a good deal of lowscrub, bushes, and thorn trees, very difficult to get through at night.The difficulty of moving masses of men with any accuracy in the dark isextreme, and to keep them together at all it was necessary for them toadvance in a compact body. In quarter column, therefore, the Brigadeadvanced and approached the foot of the hill. I have noticed severaltimes that when you get rather close to the hill the rise comes to lookmore gradual and the ridge itself does not stand up in the abrupt andsalient way that it does from a distance. Whether it was this, or simplythat the darkness of the night hid the outline, at any rate the columnapproached the hill and the trench which runs at the foot of the hillmuch too closely before the order to extend was given. When it was givenit was too late. They were in the act of executing it when the volleycame.Of course an attack like this cannot be intended altogether as asurprise--that is, it cannot be pushed home as a surprise. You cannotmarch 4000 heavy-booted men through broken ground on a dark nightwithout making plenty of noise over it; also the Boers must certainlyhave had pickets out, which would have moved in as we advanced andgiven the alarm. But had our fellows deployed at half a mile, or less,under cover of darkness, and then advanced in open order, the enemycould not have seen clearly enough to shoot with accuracy until theywere fairly close, and I daresay the fire then would not have stoppedtheir rush.As it was, the fire came focussed on a mass of men, such a fire as Isuppose has never been seen before, for not only was it a tremendousvolley poured in at point-blank range, but it was a sustained volley;the rapid action of the magazines enabling the enemy to keep up anunintermittent hail of bullets on the English column. To advance underfire of this sort is altogether impossible. It is not a question ofcourage, but of the impossibility of a single man surviving. At theModder fight our men advanced to a certain distance, but could get nonearer. They were forced to lie down and remain lying down. The fire ofmagazine rifles is such that, unless helped by guns or infinitely thestronger, the attackers have no chance of getting home. People will keepon talking as if courage did these things. What the devil's the use ofthe bravest man with half-a-dozen bullets through him? It is just ascertain as anything can be that, if the Highlanders had "gone on," intwo minutes not a man would have been left standing. Already in thebrief instant that they stood, dazed by the fire, they lost between sixand seven hundred men. The Black Watch was in front, and nineteen out oftwenty-seven officers were swept down. You might as well talk of "goingon" against a volcano in eruption.I am writing this on the day after the action in my favouritelurking-place by the side of the river under the evergreens and bigweeping willows that overhang the sluggish water. Our own small camp isclose to the stream, and here every morning the Highlanders are in thehabit of turning up, usually with much laughing and shouting, to bathingparade. There is no laughing this morning, only sad, sullen faces,silence and downcast looks. Still they are glad to talk of it. A fewcome under the shade of my tree, and sit about and tell me the littlebit that each saw or heard. You only get a general impression of chaos.Some tried to push on, some tried to extend, some lay down, and some ranback out of close range and took up such cover as they could get. Thiswas, luckily, pretty good, there being a lot of bush and rocks about,and here they gradually crawled together and got into some sort oforder, and kept up a counter fire at the Boer position. The Brigade,however, had been badly shaken, and as hour after hour passed allthrough the blazing day, and they were kept lying there under the fireof an entrenched enemy, exhausted and parched with thirst, theirpatience gradually failed, and they made another rush back, but wererallied and led up again to where the Mausers might play on them. Theywere not allowed to retire till after five, when all the troops werewithdrawn--that is, until they had been shot over at close range forabout fourteen mortal hours.The Brigade was asked to do too much, and when at last they staggeredout of action, the men jumped and started at the rustle of a twig. It'sa miserable thing when brave men are asked to do more than brave men cando.One thing that added to the panic was that none, at least among the menand junior officers, knew anything at all about the trench. They thoughtthey were going to storm the hill. So that things were so contrived thatthe bewilderment of a surprise should be added to the terrors of thevolley. You will scarcely believe this perhaps. I have just come fromhaving tea with the Argyle and Sutherland. Of the eight or ten officersthere, not one had heard of the trench. Here, by the river, I havetalked to a score of Highlanders, and not one had heard of it either.They "didn't know what the hell was up" when the volley came. We couldscarcely have provided all the elements of a panic more carefully.Nothing of note followed during the day. Airlie fended off a Boerflanking move on our right, and the Coldstreams backed up theHighlanders a bit, but practically only the Highland Brigade was in it.It was a disaster to that Brigade only, and consequently the rest of thearmy does not feel itself defeated, and is not in any way discouraged.Some people suggest now that we in our turn may be attacked, and thatthe enemy may try and retake the river position from which we shiftedhim a fortnight ago. It is reported that they have got up heavyreinforcements from Natal, and some long-range guns that will reach ourcamp from the hill. All kinds of rumours are afloat, mostly to theeffect that the Boers are circling round behind us, _via_ Douglas on thewest and Jacobsdal on the east, and mean cutting our communications.However, as I have long since found out, a camp is a hot-bed of lies.Nothing positive is known, for every one is kept in careful ignorance ofeverything that is going on. The idea is that the British soldier canonly do himself justice when the chance of taking anything like anintelligent interest in his work is altogether denied him. Theconsequence is he is driven to supply the deficiency out of his ownimagination. Ladysmith has already been taken and relieved at least adozen times, and Mafeking almost as often. To-day Buller is on his wayto Pretoria; to-morrow the Boer army will be marching on Cape Town.As for our own little army, we have been digging ourselves in here, andare perfectly secure, and I daresay we shall be able to keep open theline all right. As to relieving Kimberley, that is another thing. Cronjeevidently doesn't think we can, for he has just sent us in a messageoffering us twenty-four hours to clear out in. He is a bit of a wag isold Cronje.LETTER VIIRECONNAISSANCEBIVOUAC ON THE MODDER,_January 15_, 1900.At Modder River camp the dust lies thick and heavy. Every breeze thatblows lifts clouds of it, that hang in the air like a dense London fog,and mark the site of the camp miles and miles away. The river, moremuddy than ever, moves languidly in its deep channel. There is a Boerlaager some miles above the camp, the scourings of which--horridthought!--are constantly brought down to us. The soldiers eye theinfected current askance and call it _Boervril_. Its effect is seen inthe sickness that is steadily increasing.Thank goodness we escape it. An advantage of scouting is, that, when itcomes to a standing camp, with its attendant evils of dirt, smells, andsickness, your business carries you away, in front, or out along theflanks, where you play at hide-and-seek with the enemy, trap and aretrapped, chase and are chased, and where you bivouac healthily andpleasantly, if not in such full security, at some old Dutch farm, whereprobably fowls are to be bought, or milk and butter; or under groups ofmimosa trees among stoney deserted kopjes, where there is plenty of woodfor burning, as likely as not within reach of some old garden with figsin it ripening and grapes already ripe.One of the little pictures I shall remember belonging to Modder camp isthe sight of the soldiers at early mass. You can picture to yourself awide, flat dusty plain held in the bent arm of the river, with not atree or bush on it; flat as a table, ankle-deep in grey dust, and with aglaring, blazing sun looking down on it. The dust is so hot and deepthat it reminds one more of the ashes on the top of Vesuvius--youremember that night climb of ours?--than of anything else.Laid out in very formal and precise squares are the camps of the variousbrigades, the sharp-pointed tents ranged in exact order and looking fromfar off like symmetrical little flower-beds pricked out on the sombreplain.A stone's throw from the river is a mud wall, with a mud house at oneside scarcely rising above it, yet house and wall giving in the earlymorning a patch of black shadow in the midst of the glare. Here the oldpriest used to celebrate his mass. A hundred or two of Tommies and a fewofficers would congregate here soon after sunrise, and stand bare-headedtill the beams looked over the wall, when helmet after helmet would goon; or kneel together in the dust while the priest lifted the host.Every man had his arms, the short bayonet bobbing on the hip; everybrown and grimy hand grasped a rifle; and as the figures sink low at theringing of the bell, a bristle of barrels stands above the bowed heads.Distant horse hoofs drum the plain as an orderly gallops from one partof the camp to another. Right facing us stands Magersfontein, its uglynose with the big gun at the end of it thrust out towards us. How manyof this little brotherhood under the mud wall, idly I wonder, will eversee English meadows again?The Boers still face us at Magersfontein. Their left is south of theModder. They have a strong laager at Jacobsdal on the Reit, and havepushed west and south of that, where, from the kopjes about Zoutspan andRamdam, they threaten our lines of communication. The Reit river,flowing almost south and north for some distance parallel to therailway, though a good way east of it, is a strengthening feature forthem in that part of the field, and taking advantage of it, they havebrought their left well round. Their right, on the other hand, isscarcely brought round at all, but stretches about east and west,following the course of the Modder, and extending as far west asDouglas, fifty miles from Modder camp. They make raids south. Pilcherthe other day cut some of them up at Sunnyside and took Douglas, butevacuated it again, and it is now in their hands. Altogether you cancompare the Boer attitude to a huge man confronting you, Magersfonteinbeing his head, his left arm brought round in front of him almost atright angles to his body and his right stretched wide out in line withhis shoulders. From time to time he makes little efforts to bring theseoutstretched arms farther round, as if to clasp and enfold the Britishposition at Modder River, and it is with the special object of observingand reporting on these movements that our scouting is carried on. Thisis now attended to by fifteen of us only, under Chester Master, therest of the corps, with the Major, having gone down to join French atColesberg now that the advance here has ceased. On the east side of theline we patrol the plain nearly to Jacobsdal, and often lie in the grassor sit among the rocks and watch the little figures of Boers canteringalong the road that leads south by the river. Further scouting in thatdirection is carried on by the garrison along the line.A strong reconnaissance of ours the other day (January 9th) in thedirection of Jacobsdal was a very dignified and solemn exhibition. Ourguns rumbled forward with their eight-horse teams across the plain,while our cavalry, stretched out in open order at fifty yards apart,traversed the country in long strings that might have been seen andadmired by the enemy at a distance, I daresay, of twenty miles. ChesterMaster took us forward on the left close to the river, where a party ofthe enemy, stealing up from the river-bed, tried to cut us off--therewere only six or eight of us--and chivied us back to the main body ashard as we could go, two miles _ventre a terre_ through the peltingrain, blazing away from horseback all the time at us, but naturallydoing no harm. We thought we should lead them into a trap when we liftedthe rise, but our troops had all halted far back in the plain, and ourpursuers turned as soon as they saw them. However, we got some men tojoin us, and set to work to chase them as they had done us. It wasreally quite exciting; little bent figures of horsemen with flappinghats on ahead, bundling along for dear life, each with its spot of dustattending, we following, whooping and spurring. But bustled as theywere, the Boers knew the way they were going. There are some narrowbelts of bush that run out from the river into the plain, and as weneared one of these, crick-crack, crick-crack, the familiar croakingvoices of Mausers warned us against a nearer approach. We dismounted andfired away vaguely at the distant foe, not so much with the idea ofhitting anything, but it is always a relief to one's feelings. I don'tknow why the guns didn't come up, but was told that they didn't like topush on too far, as the Boers were supposed to be in force here. Itseemed a pity to miss such a good shot, especially as we had an enormousgreat escort and an open country back to camp. But that is the way withguns; sometimes they rush up to within 500 yards of the enemy beforethey shoot, and sometimes they won't shoot at all.The afternoon was spent in carrying out our reconnaissance. Areconnaissance is undertaken with a view to exposing the enemy'sposition and strength. Without intending a real attack, you demonstrate,feign a forward movement, push on in one place or another, or threatento turn his flanks; so obliging him to move his men here and there,expose his strength and the limits of the position, and, perhaps, thewhereabouts and number of his guns, if they should be tempted to openfire at our scouts. This is the theory of the thing. In practice itdoesn't quite work, owing to the utter ignorance of the Boers of allmilitary tactics. On all occasions when we have carried out thesemanoeuvres, notably round the Magersfontein hills before the battle,they have not only failed to make the proper responses to our moves, buthave neglected to take notice of them in any way whatever. Not a gunspeaks, not a man is to be seen. We demonstrate before empty hills.Creepily, you may conjecture the fierce eyes along the rock edge, butnothing shows. In vain we circle about the plain, advance, retire,curtsey, and set to him; our enemy, like the tortoise, "will not jointhe dance." Nothing is more discouraging. It is like playing to an emptyhouse. However, as young B---- said to me, we did our part anyway, andif they are so ignorant as not to know the counter-moves, well, theymust take the consequences. Manoeuvres of this kind, I must tell you,are a high test of military skill, and are often not fully intelligibleto the lay mind. As an instance of this, I heard a man of ours, a shrewdfellow but no soldier, say, in his coarse Colonial way, as we wereriding home, that he "was glad we had finished making a b----yexhibition of ourselves." It is to be hoped that after a little we shallget to appreciate these manoeuvres better. Just at first there is aslight suggestion of Gilbert and Sullivan about them.LETTER VIIISCOUTING ON THE MODDERTHORNHILL FARM, _January 30_, 1900.On the eastern or Jacobsdal side the country is all a plain, dull andmonotonous like a huge prairie, with no shade from the heat or shelterfrom the thunderstorms. On the western side it is very different. Greathills run roughly parallel to the river course, but leave a wide plainbetween themselves and it. They are clothed with a few scant bushes, outof which their tops rise bare and rocky; but in the shady hollows andgorges the low thorn-trees (mimosas) grow thickly, and over the plainthat stretches to the river their grey foliage gathers into thick coversor is sometimes dotted here and there. The smell of the mimosa flowers(little yellow balls of pollen-covered blossom) is the most delicious Iknow, and the air as we ride through these lonely covers, where a fewbuck seem the only tenants, is fragrant with it. Far apart there arefarms, prettily situated, generally close to the hills, the rocky sidesof the kopjes rising behind, the wide plain spread in front. Each hasits dam, sometimes more than one, built round with mud embankments, withhuge weeping willows overhanging, and rows of tall poplars and blue gums(with shreds of bark rattling), and plenty of other trees. Thefarmhouses themselves are uninteresting, but the gardens, with theirgreat thicket hedges of prickly pear and quince and brilliant blossomingpomegranate, are delightful, especially at this time, when the fruit isjust getting ripe.It was out on this western side, where we were feeling for the enemy'sright flank, some twenty miles from camp, in a niche half way up themountain, that we spent our last Christmas. We rather expected anattack, as a Kaffir of ours had been taken by them, and might beexpected to reveal our movements. After dark we climbed the hill,dragging our ponies over the boulders and scratching our way through thethorns.The Boer hill was four or five miles distant, north across the plain.All along its purple sides we ranged with our glasses, seeing nothing;but after dark several little points of light showed where their laagerwas. We sat all night among the rocks (I thought of you and theroast-turkey and holly), occasional heavy drops of rain falling, and aflicker of lightning now and then. Heavy clouds rolled up, and the nightset in as dark as pitch. The level plain below us lay flat as a pancakefrom their hill to ours. So passed our '99 Christmas, picturesquepossibly, but not very comfortable. Dark hillside; rain in large warmdrops; night dark, with a star or two and struggling moon. In front, adistant hillside, with points of camp-fire twinkling, where the Boers,indifferent to our little party, were carousing and drinking their_dop._ Now and then a yawn or groan as a man stretches his crampedlimbs. Down below under us an expanse of dark plain, like a murky sea,reaching to our feet, which we peer across, but can make out nothing.Peep-of-day time is the Boer's favourite hour for a call, and we wereall very much on the _qui vive_ when the white line showed along theeast. No doubt, however, they all had such heads after their Christmasdrink that they were in no humour for such a diversion. At any rate,they let us alone. Very stiff and weary and wet, we crept down the hillsoon after daybreak and started on our twenty-mile homeward march. Itwas 5 P.M. before we reached camp, and we had had nothing to eat allday. I don't know if we were most tired or hungry. Take that three daysas a sample of work. We start at 6 A.M. on Sunday; do a full day'sriding and scouting, and get three hours' sleep that night at Enslin.Then we saddle up and pass the rest of the night and all the next dayriding, except when we are climbing hills on foot to look out. Thesecond night we sit among the hills expecting an attack, and next daytill one o'clock are in the saddle again. _A la guerre comme a laguerre_. Three days and two nights' hard work on three hours' sleep. Andall this time you are drinking champagne (well, most of it, anyway), andsleeping in soft beds with delicious white sheets, and smoking Egyptiancigarettes, and wearing clean clothes, with nice stiff collars and shirtcuffs, and having a bath in the morning, warm, with sweet-smelling soap(Oh, my God!), and sitting side by side at table, first a man and then awoman; the same old arrangement, I suppose, knives to the right andforks to the left as usual. Ho! ho! There are times I could laugh. Nodoubt we shall all get _redigested_ as soon as we get back, butmeantime, as a set-off to the hardship, one knows what it is to feelfree. We eat what we can pick up, and we lie down to sleep on the bareground. We wash seldom, and our clothes wear to pieces on our bodies. Wefind we can do without many things, and though we sometimes miss them,there comes a keen sense of pleasure from being entire master of oneselfand all one's possessions. Your water-bottle hangs on your shoulder;your haversack, with your blanket, is strapped to your saddle; rifle,bandolier, and a pair of good glasses are your only other possessions.As you stand at your pony's side ready to mount, you may be starting forthe day or you may be away a fortnight, but your preparations are thesame.Above all others does this scouting life develop your faculties, sharpenyour senses of hearing and of seeing, and, in practical ways, ofthinking too; of noting signs and little portents and drawingconclusions from them; of observing things. You feel more _alive_ thanyou ever felt before. Every day you are more or less dependent on yourown faculties. Not only for food and drink for yourself and your pony,but for your life itself. And your faculties respond to the call. Yourglance, as it scans the rocks and the plain, is more wary and morevigilant; your ears, as you lie in the scrub, prick themselves at asound like a Red Indian's, and the least movement among cattle or gameor Kaffirs, or the least sign that occurs within range of your glasses,is noticed and questioned in an instant.This you get in return for all you give up--in return for thesweet-smelling soap and the footman who calls you in the morning. Oh,that pale-faced footman! It is dawn when, relieved on look-out, Iclamber down the rocks to our bivouac. A few small fires burn, and mypal points to a tin coffee cup and baked biscuit by one of them. It isthe hour at home for the pale-faced footman. I see him now, entering theroom noiselessly with cautious tread as if it were a sick-room, softlydrawing a curtain to let a little light into the darkened apartment, andapproaching with a cup of tea that the poor invalid has barely to reachout his hand to. Round our little camp I look, noting trifles with akeen enjoyment. Shall I ever submit to that varlet again? No, never! Iwill leap from my bed and wrestle with him on the floor. I will anointhim with my shaving soap and duck him in the bath he meant for me. Doyou know the emancipated feeling yourself? Do you know the sensationwhen your glance is like a sword-thrust and your health like a devil's;when just to touch things with your fingers gives a thrill, and to lookat and see common objects, sticks and trees, is like drinking wine?Don't you? Oh, be called by twenty footmen and be hanged to you!This Christmas patrol of ours was of use in touching the southernmostand westernmost limits of the Boer position. It has shown that theenveloping movement of which so much has been said, and which has beenpressed now and then on the east side, has not made much progress on thewest.The big mountain range, running east and west, comes to an end somethirty miles west of Modder Camp, where it breaks up into a few detachedmasses and peaks. The extreme one of these, a sugar-loaf cone, is calledthe Pintberg, and on this lonely eerie a picket of ours is generallyplaced; crouched among the few crags and long grass tufts that form itspoint, the horses tethered in the hollow behind; listening by night andwatching by day. When we come out thus far, we sometimes stay out a weekor more at a time. The enemy's position is along the hills north of theplain by the river--chiefly north of it, but in places south.I am turning over my diary with the idea of giving you a notion of thesort of life we lead, but find nothing remarkable."Last night, Vice, Dunkley, and I were on lookout on the kopje. Therehad been a heavy storm in the afternoon and another broke as we reachedthe hill. We crouched in our cloaks waiting for it to pass beforeclimbing up, as the ironstone boulders are supposed to attract thelightning (I have heard it strike them; it makes a crack like apistol-shot, and Colonials don't like staying on the hill tops during astorm). We passed all night on our airy perch among the rocks, half wetand the wind blowing strong. It was a darkish and cloudy night, rathercold. Watched the light die out of the stormy sky; the lightningflickering away to leeward; wet gleams from the plain where the watershone here and there; moaning and sighing of wind through rock andbranch. We were relieved by Lancers in the morning and jogged back toThornhill, where our little camp is, and I am writing this in the shadeof a big mimosa close to the garden wall."I have seen prints in shop windows of farms and soldiers, bits ofcountry life and war mixed, a party of Lancers or Uhlans calling at someold homestead, watering their horses or bivouacking in the garden. Oftenwhat I see now makes me think of these subjects. A large camp is hideousand depressing; dirty and worn, the ground trampled deep in dust; filthand refuse lying about; the entrails and skins of animals, flies,beastly smells, and no excitement or animation. But these outlyingscenes, scouts, pickets, &c., have a peculiar interest. This garden, forinstance, is itself pretty and wild, with its tangle of figs, its avenueof quinces (great golden fruit hanging), its aloes all down the side,with heavy, blue spikes and dead stems sticking thirty feet in air,branching and blackened like fire-scorched fir-trees, and its dark greenoranges and other fruit and flower-trees all mixed in a kind ofwilderness; and behind this the steep kopjes, with black boulders heapedto the sky, and soft grey mimosas in between. It is a pretty spot initself, but what a different, strange interest is brought in by the twoor three carbines leaning against the wall, the ponies, ready saddled,tethered at the corner, the hint of camp-fire smoke climbing up througha clump of trees, and now and then a khaki-clad figure or two passingbetween the trunks or lying under them asleep."Here is another little extract, a bit of a night-spy by three of us onthe west side, where we had heard that the Douglas commando wasestablishing a laager near a drift some thirteen miles below camp; amove forward of their right arm, if true."The night was dark as pitch, and very windy, just what we wanted. Aftermissing our way several times, whispering, consulting, and feeling aboutin the dark, we came on the wattle fence and beehive huts of a Kaffirkraal. Up to this we crept, and Vice dived into the hole of an entrance,and after some underground rumblings emerged with an old nigger as youdraw a badger from his earth. The old man was soon persuaded by amoderate bribe to be our guide to the spot we wished to reconnoitre. Hetold us that parties of Boers were pretty often round that way, and thatone had passed the previous night at the kraal. Dunkley agreed to staywith the horses, and Vice and I went on with the Kaffir. The country wasgrassy, with plentiful belts and clumps of silvery bush. After a whilethe moon shone out and the clouds dispersed, which made us feeldisagreeably conspicuous in the white patches between the bush."Exmoor, as far as the contour of the ground is concerned, is a littlelike the more up-and-down parts of the veldt, and scouting there wouldbe very much like scouting here. For instance, suppose your camp was atMinehead, the Boers being in strength at Winsford, and a report comes inthat they have pushed on a strong picket to Simonsbath. This rumour itis your business to test. With two friends on a dark, windy night youset out. You leave the road and take to the moor. You ride slowly,listening, watching intently, keeping off the high ground, and as muchas possible avoiding sky-lines. At some cottage or moorland farm youleave the horses and creep forward on foot, working along the hollowsand studying every outline. If they are at Simonsbath, they will have alookout on the hill this side. A British picket would show its helmetsat a mile, but the Boers don't affect sky-lines. They will be on thisside, with the hill for a background, and very likely right down on theflat; for though by day the higher you are the better for seeing, yet atnight, when your only chance is to see people against the sky, the loweryou are the better. These points and others you discuss in whispers,crouched in the dark hollows, and then creep forward again."Vice and I crawled to the top of our ridge at last just as morning wasbreaking. There were bushes and rocks to hide among, and the clouds hadall gone, and day broke clear. The deep river ravine lay right below us,and as the light penetrated, the first thing we saw was a small sheltertent with a cart or waggon by the side of it. We grinned and nudged eachother and wagged our heads at the discovery, but kept them carefullyhidden. Farther west was a detached kopje, the site of a permanent Boerpicket, according to the Kaffir; but there was no regular laager. Therewere no horses grazing about, no cattle, no smoke, none of the usual andinevitable signs. A picket! Yes. Pushed out from Koodoosberg, the bighill which rises abruptly from the plain three or four miles off, but noreal occupation. After studying the country yard by yard with ourglasses, and making a few notes about the lie of the land and the namesand positions of farms, we creep off and get back to camp by mid-day."The results of these exciting little prowls, when worth while, are sentin to the General, and from the mass of evidence thus placed before himhe is supposed to be able to define the enemy's position and movements.Chester Master and our little body were paid a pretty compliment by theGeneral the other day; for the Major having written to ask if we mightjoin him, Methuen replied that he was sorry to have to refuse, but thatwe were doing invaluable work, and he really couldn't spare us.Well, fare you well. We hear of heavy reinforcements arriving. They willbe very welcome. Magersfontein, Colenso, Stormberg; we could do with achange. But what a revelation, is it not? Are these the prisoners thatwe played at dice for? One thing in it all pleases me, and that is thetemper and attitude of England. I like the gravity, the quiet, doggedrolling up of the shirt-sleeves much better than the blustering,wipe-something-off-a-slate style which the papers made so familiar to usat the beginning.LETTER IXTHE ADVANCEMODDER RIVER CAMP,_February 13_, 1900.We are back in the old camp, but only for a few hours. This afternoon wemarch. Yesterday, crossing the line, we had a glimpse of Rimington andthe rest of the corps. They have come up with French, and are offeastward on the flank march. We shall be after them hotfoot before dark.Things begin to shape themselves. We are going to bring our right armround, leaving Magersfontein untouched, and relieve Kimberley by a flankmarch in force. Methuen stays here. Poor fellow! I wish him joy of it.Bobs and Kitchener direct the advance; French heads it. They say weshall march 50,000 strong. The line is choked with troop trains,batteries, siege guns, naval guns, and endless truckloads of stores andprovisions. _At last!_ is every one's feelings. The long waited formoment has come. You know a hawk's hover? Body steady, wings beating,and then the rushing swoop. So with the army. We have hovered steadyhere these two months with our wings stretched. Now we swoop.Far out on the left flank our little body of fifteen has been in a greatstate of suspense for several weeks. We knew the great tide of advancewas setting up from Orange River to the Modder, and as no orders camefor us, we began to think we should be out of it. Then one evening, as Iwas sitting on some boulders above camp looking out over the country, Isaw Chester Master riding in from headquarters with a smile on his face,and the sort of look that a man has who brings good news. Down Iclambered. Yes, it had come. We were to move that night. The advance hadbegun, and we were off on an all-night march to catch up French. What achange came over the men! Instead of bored, sulky faces, and growlingsand grumblings, all were now keen and alert. When the moon rose westarted. Our very ponies seemed to know they were "in the movement," andstepped out cheerily. The night was clear as silver, and each man'sshadow moved by his side, clean cut on the ground like the shadowsthrown by the electric light outside the Criterion. Song and joke passedonce more, and soon up went the favourite cavalry march, the moststirring tune of any, "Coming thro' the Rye." It was very jolly. Notoften has one ridden on such a quest, on such a night, to such a tune asthat.So, old Modder, fare you well! Farewell the huge plain that one grew sofond of, with its blue and yellow bars of light, morning and evening;the shaggy kopjes heaped with black rocks, the secluded, lonely farmsnestling beneath, old Cook's, where the figs were ripe in the garden,and Mrs. Dugmore, who gave us fresh bread and butter and stewed peaches.Not soon shall I forget those morning patrols. The sea of veldt, thepure air, the carelessness, the comradeship, and the freedom. OldGordon has a good verse that I find sometimes running in my head--    "It was merry in the morning    Among the gleaming grass,    To wander as we've wandered many a mile,    And blow the cool tobacco cloud    And watch the white wreaths pass,    Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while."And then the secret bivouacs and lurking-places along the river or inamong the deserted hills. The lookout from the tall pyramid, where Ihave kept watch so many hours day and night, in heat of sun or withstars glittering overhead.It was from this kopje that we got notice to quit, by the way. Ournotice taking the shape of several little brown-backed Boers gallopingabout and spying at us from a hill one and a half miles to the north.That night we drew out in the plain after dark and camped (no fires)among the bushes, and at grey dawn stole back to have another look. Backdashes one of our advance scouts to tell us that a big force of Boerswas just rounding the point. Next minute we were swinging out into theplain, through the low scrub and thorn bush, and as we did so the Boerscame through the Nek. They must have known exactly where our usual campwas, and crept up overnight to cut us off. It wasn't by much that theymissed. Three or four loiterers, as it was, had a warm minute or two.The first single shots grew to a sudden fierce crackle, like the crackleof a dry thorn branch on the fire, as they came through the bush. Butthey came on nevertheless, one horse hit only, and joined us, and weformed up and started at a steady gallop for the hills beyond the plain,six miles off; where there was a quite strong camp, established a fewdays before, for which we have lately been scouting. The Boers chased ussome way, but we had got a long start, as they came through the roughground, and they were never on terms with us. Still it was near enough.Five minutes earlier and what a slating we should have got!We were told afterwards that the plan on this side was to draw the Boerssouth of the hills, so as to give the cavalry, which was to movewestward just north of the range, a chance of cutting them off. Thecavalry, however, didn't turn up. No one seemed to know what had becomeof them, and I daresay they were saying the same of us. The advice notto let your left hand know what your right hand is doing is sometimesrather too literally followed in these manoeuvres, I think. Meantime theBoers have driven off all old Cook's cattle and all Mrs. Dugmore's too;and as we were sent out with the express object of "reassuring thefarmers," the result is not entirely satisfactory.No matter; this was all a side issue; now for a larger stage and moreimportant operations. Blow trumpets and sound drums. Enter Lord Robertsand the main army.LETTER XRELIEF OF KIMBERLEYKIMBERLEY CLUB, _February 18_.It is with feelings of the deepest satisfaction that I look at theaddress at the head of this notepaper. Indeed for the last five minutesI have been staring at it dreamily without putting pen to paper,repeating "Kimberley Club, Kimberley," to myself, vaguely thinking ofall it portends; the varied fortunes of the last three months; thecheery setting out; the first battles, that already seem so long ago;the repulse, and long, dreary wait by Modder; the gradual reconstructionof the whole plan of attack, and now the final achievement. Christianand I have been sharing a pint of champagne in the club bar. It was nottill I heard the bottle pop that I realised, as by a sudden inspiration,that the British army had really attained its object at last. Verygravely we gave each other luck, and gravely drank our wine. Both of us,I am glad to be able to tell you, rose to the occasion, and as we lookedacross the bubbles, no foolish chaff or laughter marred the moment.I wrote you my last letter from old Modder just as we were leaving tocatch French. Marching light and fast, we got up with him on the nightof the 15th at the Klip Drift on the Modder, northeast of Jacobsdal.From there we were sent back to guide on Kitchener, which we did,bringing him to French's camp on the river by 6 A.M. next morning(16th). We met on the way our little ambulance cart bobbing home withthe adjutant languidly reclining. He had had one of those escapes thatnow and then come off. There was a high hill to the north, and up thisthe previous morning, R., an active walker, had climbed to have a viewof the country. He reached the top, which is like a gable, slanting bothsides to a thin edge, and precisely as he did so, ten or a dozen greathairy Boers reached it from the other side, and, at ten yards' distanceacross the rock edge, their eyes met. Can you conceive a more disgustingtermination to a morning stroll? Without a word said, R. took to hisheels and the Boers to their Mausers. Down the hill went R., boundinglike a buck, and all round him whipped and whined the bullets among therocks. Twice he went headlong, twisting his ankle badly once as thestones turned underfoot; but he reached the bottom untouched and theshelter of the bluff where he had left his pony, jumped on and dashedout into the plain and under the Boer fire again, and got clean awaywithout a scratch, him and his pony. Was ever such luck?French started on his final relief march about an hour later, and wewere not able to accompany him as our horses were absolutely done up. Itwas very disappointing at the time to see him ride off on this laststage with a large party of our comrades, led by Rimington himself (hewas first into Kimberley, we heard afterwards) at the head. However, asthings turned out, it did not much matter, for the next day we had aninteresting time, and saw a big job put in train, which is not finishedyet, and which we shall probably see more of if we start, as they say,to-morrow.The thing began at grey dawn. Chester Master and two or three Guideswere sent forward to reconnoitre a kopje where the Boers the day beforehad had a gun. We found the gun gone. Some marks of blood, a half-duggrave, and two dead horses, showed that the fire of our long naval gunhad been more or less effective. We then rode on, the column we wereguiding getting gradually into formation, and we were just mounting thenext ridge, when down in the valley beneath we saw a long line ofwaggons, stretching away eastward for miles, dragged by huge bullockteams. They were making the best of their way forward, each with a partyof mounted men riding at the side, and at the first glance, so close toour army and camp were they, I almost fancied it must be a convoy of ourown. However, we realised what was up pretty quickly. The Boers, hearingof French's flank march, and fearing they would be cut off if theyremained, were abandoning their position in the hills aboutMagersfontein, which they had intrenched so strongly, and were quietlyand promptly moving off towards Bloemfontein. The rearguard of theirline was at that moment just opposite to us.Chester Master immediately sent back an orderly as hard as he could goto tell our fellows what was in front and hurry them up, every momentbeing now of the utmost importance if we wanted to intercept the enemy.The Boers themselves took their measures instantly and with their usualcoolness. A long line of kopjes ran eastward across the plain, flankingthe line of their march, and directly they saw they were discovered,their horsemen dashed forward and began to occupy these, thus guardingthe right flank of their retreat from our attack. Seeing this, ChesterMaster galloped back himself to urge on our Mounted Infantry, who werenow mustering rapidly to the attack.From the kopje on the extreme left front, where we were, we could nowsee extended at our feet the whole plan of the approaching battle, whileas yet the two sides were invisible to each other. In the valley on thenorth side of the kopjes the Boers were urging on their convoy andrapidly despatching their sharpshooters to hold the hills along theirright. On the south side were the masses of our columns, with thesquadrons of Mounted Infantry now detaching themselves from the mainbody, and beginning to stream across the level plain towards the samehills; all with heads bent one way, horses prancing and pulling, andwith all the signs of eager excitement, as though they divined, thoughas yet they could not see, the presence of the enemy. Over the dustyplain they canter, but they are too late by a few minutes. The Boers arethere already, and as the Mounted Infantry come along, passing closebeneath us, an outbreak of rifle-fire occurs, and the dry plain, whichis of perfectly bare earth, is dotted with little white puffs of dust asthe bullets strike along it. The fire is a bit short, but schooled bythis time in "kopje tactics," and realising what is coming, oursquadrons very prudently pull up and wait for the guns. They haven'tlong to wait. I always love to see the guns come up. Over stones androcks and bushes, six strong horses at the gallop, the drivers lashingthe off horses, the guns jumping and rumbling and swinging; then theyell, "Action front," and round come the teams with a splendid sweep;next instant they are cast off and jingle to the rear, and the littlevenomous guns are left crouching like toads, looking towards the enemy;the gunners are upon them before they are at a standstill (everythinghappens simultaneously); there is an instant's pause while the barrelrises, and then comes the naked spurt of fire, no smoke, and the officersteps clear of the dust and glues his glasses to his eyes as the shellscreams on its way. Within ten minutes of our first viewing the enemy,half a battery had got into action near our kopje, and was bombardingthe first hill along the enemy's flank.Two or three of the Boer waggons, the last of the line, had beenabandoned when their retreat was first discovered. These we tookpossession of, and with them two Dutchmen and some coloured boys, one ofwhom had been driver to a field-cornet of Cronje's. From him we learntthat Cronje had definitely abandoned the whole Magersfontein position,that this was the tail of his force going through, and that consequentlythere was nothing to be feared from a rear attack. Chester Master wrotea hasty despatch to this effect to Kitchener and gave it to me, afterwhich I had a most amusing ride through our lines from the extreme leftto the extreme right, where Kitchener was. First by our batteries,thundering and smoking (the enemy only had one gun in action that I saw,but I must say it did very well, feeling for the range with two shortshots, and after that getting well into our guns every time), and thenon through the Mounted Infantry, who kept on charging and retiring,until finally after three miles' ride I came to the far right, whereKitchener and the big naval gun sat together in state on the top of asmall kopje strewn with black shining rocks. Here I gave in my despatch,"From Captain Chester Master, left front, sir," and the best militarysalute I have yet mastered (inclined to go into fits of laughter at theabsurdity of the whole thing all the time), and the great man, with hissullen eye, sitting among his black rocks all alone, reads it and asksme a question or two, and vouchsafes to tell me that the information is"very important," which I suppose meant that he had not been certainwhether he was in contact with the middle or extreme tail of the enemy'sforce. Various officers of the staff come up and I tell them all I know.I am very hungry and parched with thirst, but I know I shall get nothingout of these fellows. However, my luck holds. Under some thorn-treesbelow I spy the flat hats of the sailors, and under the lee of anammunition waggon hard by a group of officers. All is well. Five minuteslater I am pledging them in a whisky and sparklet, and sitting down tosuch a breakfast as I have not tasted for weeks. God bless all sailors,say I!Orders meantime come thick and fast from the grim watcher on the rocksabove, and troop after troop of Mounted Infantry go scouring away to theattack. It is a running fight. Kopje after kopje, as the Boers push on,breaks into fire and is left extinct behind. But still they keep theirflank unbroken and their convoy intact. For the hundredth time I admiretheir dogged courage under these, the most trying of all circumstances,the protection of a slow retreat.So it goes on through the day, and I have great fun galloping about onmy own account, looking into things here and there, and watching thegeneral progress of events. I meet Chester Master again about 5 P.M.,and he asks me to ride forthwith to Kimberley with him if Flops canstand it. All the Boer force has cleared from Magersfontein (ourinformation was all right) and is in retreat on Bloemfontein, andKitchener is sending word by Chester Master to French, bidding him rightturn and march to head off the Boer retreat, while he (Kitchener) hangson their tail.An hour later we start; four of us. Chester Master, myself, May, and ablack boy. It is a twenty-three mile ride. A full moon is in the sky butclouds obscure it, which is a good thing, as the country is beingtraversed by stragglers of theirs, leaving the hills and in retreateastward. We hear of several such fugitive bodies from our pickets forthe first few miles. Then we are in absolute solitude. The plain liesbare and blanched around us. A thorn bush or two sticks up on it, or,now and then, the ghastly shape of a dead horse lying in puffed uprelief with legs sticking out stiff and straight and an awful stenchblowing from it. Kimberley's search-light at stated intervals stillswings its spoke over our head.Six or seven miles out from Kimberley my pony gives out, and ChesterMaster and May on fresh horses ride on, leaving me the boy. We plod on,an interesting, delicious ride. I get off and walk. A little windrustles over the dry earth and bushes, but otherwise there is not awhisper of sound. The landscape at one moment lies white before us as ifit had been washed in milk, and the next is blotted out with clouds. Nowand again we pause to listen, and the boy stands like a bronze image ofAttention with bent head and held breath, the whites only of his eyesmoving as he rolls them from one object to another. At last from a lowkopje top by the path comes the first loud and welcome "Halt! Who goesthere?" of an English picket. Another two or three miles brings me to anoutpost of the town, and there, dead tired and Flops the same, I flingmyself on the ground, after hearty greetings and a word or two of talkwith the guard, and do a three hours' sleep till the dawn of the 17th.In a grey light I rouse myself to look out across the wet misty flat,hearing some one say, "Who's that? What force is that?" followedimmediately by "Call out the guard; stand to your arms, men." But then,as light increases, we see by the regular files and intervals that theforce is British, and I know that Chester Master has got in all rightand delivered his message, and French already, at a few hours' notice,is casting back with that terrible cavalry of his after Cronje and theretreating Boers.Kimberley does not in the least give one the idea of a beleaguered andrelieved town. There are a few marks of shells, but so few and farbetween as not to attract attention, and you might walk all about thetown without being struck by anything out of the common. I have sampledthe roast-horse and roast-mule which the garrison seems to have beenchiefly living on for the past five or six weeks, and find both prettygood, quite equal, if not superior, to the old trek-ox. Some people tellus pathetic stories of the hardships to women and young children andbabies, owing to the difficulty of getting proper food, especially milk.On the other hand, many seem to have actually enjoyed the siege, and twoor three young ladies have assured me that they found it infinitelydiverting and enjoyed an excellent time, making up afternoon tea-partiesamong their friends. The relief was not the occasion of any excitementor rejoicing whatever. People walked about the streets and went abouttheir business and served in their shops without showing in theirappearance or manner any trace of having passed through a bad time orhaving been just delivered from it. They seemed, on the whole, glad tosee us, but there was no enthusiasm. This was partly due, I think, tothe absence of drink. The Colonial's idea of gratitude andgood-fellowship is always expressed in drink, and cannot be separatedfrom it, or even exist without it. Many felt this. Several said to me,"We are awfully glad to see you, old chap, but the fact is there's nowhisky." On the whole, except the last week, during which the Boers hada hundred-pounder gun turned on, one doesn't gather that the siege ofKimberley was noteworthy, as sieges go, either for the fighting done orthe hardships endured. But that is not to reflect on the defenders, whoshowed a most plucky spirit all through, and would have resisted a muchseverer strain if it had been brought to bear upon them.LETTER XIPAARDEBERG--THE BOMBARDMENT_February 24_, 1900.We are once more upon the Modder. I should think the amount of blood,Dutch and English, this river has drunk in the last few months will giveit a bad name for ever. There is something deadly about that wordModder. Say it over to yourself. Pah! It leaves a taste of blood in themouth.We have been fighting in a desultory kind of way for the last week here.Coming from Kimberley, where we had gone to holloa back French (youcould follow him by scent all the way from the dead horses), we made aforced march and rejoined him here by the river, where he is busilyengaged, with Kitchener at the other end, in bombarding old Cronje inthe middle. They have fairly got the old man. Kitchener had stuck to himpretty tight, it seems, after we left them that evening at Klip Drift.French has nicked in ahead. Macdonald has arrived, I believe, or isarriving, and there are various other brigades and divisions casting upfrom different quarters, all concentrating on unhappy Cronje. LordRoberts, I suppose, will get the credit, but part of it, one wouldthink, belongs to Kitchener, who planned the movement and put it intrain before Lord Roberts arrived.Cronje, by all accounts, has about 4000 men with him. He has dughimself into the river banks, which are steep and afford good cover. Youwould never guess, sweeping the scene with your glasses, that an armycould be hiding there. The river curves and winds, its course marked bythe tops of the willows that grow along its banks. The land on bothsides stretches bare and almost level, but there are a few rises andknolls from which our artillery smashes down its fire on the Boerlaager. At one point you can make out a ragged congregation of waggons,broken and shattered, some of them burning or smouldering. That is wherethe laager is, but not a soul can one see move. The place looks an uttersolitude, bare and lifeless in the glare of the sun. There is no replyto our busy guns. The little shrapnel clouds, stabbed with fire, burstnow here now there, sometimes three or four together, over the spot, andthe blue haze floats away, mingling with the darker, thicker vapour fromthe less frequent lyddite. "What are they shooting at?" a stranger wouldsay; "there is nobody there." Isn't there? Only 4000 crafty, vigilantBoers, crowding in their holes and cuddling their Mausers. Ask theHighlanders.You will have heard all about that by this time. The desperate attemptlast Sunday to take the position by storm. It was another of thosefiendish "frontal attacks." Have we been through Belmont and Graspan andModder River and Magersfontein for nothing? Or must we teach everygeneral in turn who comes to take charge of us what the army has learntlong ago, that a frontal attack against Mausers is leading up to yourenemy's strong suit. For Methuen there were reasons. Methuen could notoutflank, could not go round, was not strong enough to leave his linesof communication, and had practically no cavalry. He had to go straighton. Belmont, Graspan, and Modder were turnpike gates. The toll washeavy, but there was no choice but to pay. But what was the reason ofthis latest? We had them here safely bottled up. We have them still. Itis only a question of days. The attack could have gained nothing bysuccess; has lost little by its failure. The casualties were 1500. Iknow all about eggs and omelettes, but these were simply thrown in thegutter.Never tell me these Boers aren't brave. What manner of life, think you,is in yonder ditch? Our artillery rains down its cross fire of shellsperpetually. The great ox-waggons are almost totally destroyed or burnt.The ammunition in the carts keeps blowing up as the fire reaches it. Thebeasts, horses and oxen, are strewn about, dead and putrid, anddeserters say that the stench from their rotting carcasses isunbearable. Night and day they have to be prepared for infantry attacks,and yet, to the amazement of all of us, they still hold out.Old Cronje's apparent object is to try and save Bloemfontein by delayingus till reinforcements come up from the south and east. This is reallywhat we want, because the more of the enemy we get in front of thisgreat army of ours, the harder we shall be able to hit them. Butevidently Cronje is ignorant of our strength.Meantime we can make out in our break-of-day scoutings up the river thatbodies of men are approaching from the east. They have made a laagerabout ten miles up, and evidently mean to dispute our passage to thecapital. The longer old Cronje holds out, the more men from Colesbergand Natal will come up, the more entrenchments will be cut, and theharder will be our way to Bloemfontein. 'Tis the only way he sees tosave the town, for we should march straight in else. Perhaps, too, hecherishes some hope of being relieved himself; of a determined attackfrom without, which might enable him, by a sudden sally, to breakthrough; though, for dismounted men (and their horses are all dead bythis time), the chances of ultimate escape in a country like this mustbe very small, one would think. Anyhow, he sticks to his work like aglutton. The shells burst over them. The lyddite blows them up in smokeand dust, the sun grills, the dead bodies reek, our infantry creep onthem day and night; foul food, putrid water, death above and around,they grin and bear it day after day to gain the precious hours. And allthe time we on our side know perfectly well that no relief they couldpossibly bring up would serve our army for rations for a day.LETTER XIIPAARDEBERG--THE SURRENDER_March 5_, 1900.Well, that is over, and I hope you are satisfied. We have got Cronje.His victories are o'er. We have also got Mrs. Cronje, which was a bitmore than we bargained for. They cut her an extra deep hole, I hear, tobe out of shell-fire, and she sat at the bottom all day long, receivingoccasional visits from Cronje, and having her meals handed down to her.One can fancy her blinking up at her "Man," whom she always, I am told,accompanies on his campaigns, and shaking her head sorrowfully over thesituation. There is nothing very spirit-stirring about a mud hole and anold woman sitting at the bottom of it, but the danger and the terriblehardships were real enough. That is always the way with these Dutch.They have all the harsh realities and none of the glamour and romance.Athens, with their history and record, would have made the whole worldring for ever. But they are dumb. It seems such a waste.Albrecht too is among the prisoners, the famous German "expert," whodesigns their works for them and manages their artillery; and we havetaken 4000 prisoners, and several guns and one detested "pompon." Come,now, here is a little bit of all right at last.I was one of a party that rode down with the Major on the morning ofthe surrender to the laager and saw the prisoners marched in. Theyseemed quite cheery and pleased with themselves. They were dressed inall sorts of ragged, motley-looking clothes; trousers of cheap tweed,such as you see hung up in an East End slop-shop; jackets once black,now rusted, torn and stained, and battered hats. They reminded me moreof a mob of Kent hop-pickers than anything else, and it was a matter ofsome surprise, not to say disgust, to some of us to think that such asorry crowd should be able to withstand disciplined troops in the waythey did.I talked to several of them. They all agreed in saying that they hadbeen through the most ghastly time in the last ten days and wereheartily glad it was over. They exchanged nods and good-days with us andthe soldiers who were standing about, and altogether seemed in a veryfriendly and conciliatory mood. All this, however, it struck me, wasrather put on, a bit of acting which was now and then a trifle overdone.Boers are past-masters at hiding their real feelings and affecting anythat they think will be acceptable. It is a trait which has become anational characteristic, and the craft, dissimulation, the _slimness_,as it is called, of the Boers is a by-word. I suppose it comes from thepolitical situation, the close neighbourhood of a rival race, strongerand more energetic, which fosters in the stolid Dutchman, by way ofbuckler, this instinctive reticence and cunning. His one idea is to makewhat he can out of the situation without troubling his head for amoment about his own candour and sincerity. It is Oriental, the traityou expect to find in a John Chinaman, but which surprises you in aburly old Dutchman. Still there it is. At any farm you go to, men,women, and children will put on a semblance of friendship, and set towork to lie with a calmness which is really almost dignified. No one inthis country ever believes a thing a bit the more because a Dutchmansays it.We went on into the captured laager. It was an extraordinary,interesting, and loathsome sight. Dead bodies of horses and men lay inall directions in various stages of decomposition, and the reeking smellwas something quite indescribable. I fancied, even after leaving theplace, that I carried the smell about with me, and that it had got intomy clothes. The steep river banks were honeycombed with little holes andtunnels, and deep, narrow pits, like graves; narrow at the top, andhollowed out below to allow less entrance for shells. Evidently each manhad cut his own little den. Some were done carelessly, mere pits scoopedout. Others were deep, with blankets or old shawls spread at the bottom,and poles with screens of branches laid across the top to keep off thesun. I saw one or two which were quite works of art; very narrow tunnelscut into the side of the river-cliff, and turning round after youentered, making a quite secure retreat, unless perhaps an extra heavyold lyditte might happen to burst the whole bank up. This actuallyhappened, they told us, with the very last shot fired the night before;a bit of the bank having been blown up with eight men in it, of whomfive were killed and three wounded. The whole river channel looks as ifa big colony of otters or beavers had settled here, honeycombing thebank with their burrows, and padding the earth bare and hard with theirfeet. It was all worn like a highroad. On the other side, the waggonswere a sight; shattered, and torn, and wrecked with shot; many of themburnt; several, huge as they are, flung upside down by the force of ashell bursting beneath them. All their contents were littered and strewnabout in every direction; blankets, clothes, carpenters' andblacksmiths' tools, cooking utensils, furniture. You would have thoughtthe Boers were settlers moving to a new country with all their effects,instead of an army on the march. This is how they do things, however, inthe homely, ponderous fashion. They often take their women and childrenwith them. There were many in the crowd we captured.I wandered about alone a long time, looking at the dismal, curious scenewhere so much had been endured. White flags, tied to poles or strippedbranches, fluttered from waggon tops. Our ambulance carts came along,and the Tommies, stripping to the waist, proceeded to carry, one by one,the Dutch wounded through the ford on stretchers.We are bivouacked ourselves far up the river, in a secluded nook amongmimosas and kopjes with the thick current of the lately unknown, but nowtoo celebrated, Modder rolling in front of us. The weather has changedof late. It is now autumn. We have occasional heavy rains, and you wakeup at night sometimes to find yourself adrift in a pool of water. Itgets chilly too.The enemy are all about the place, and we interview them every morningat daybreak, sometimes exchanging shots, sometimes not. We lay littletraps for each other, and vary our manoeuvres with intent to deceive.This advance guard business (we are dealing here with the relief partiesof Boers that have come up between us and Bloemfontein) always remindsme of two boxers sparring for an opening. A feint, a tap, a leap back,both sides desperately on the alert and wary.We lost poor Christian yesterday in one of these little encounters. Hewas mortally wounded in stopping at short range to pick up a friendwhose horse had been shot. I have mentioned him, I think, to you in myletters. There was no one in the corps more popular. "Tell the old dad Idied game," was what he said when the Major, coming up with supports,knelt down to speak to him.Nothing very noteworthy has occurred since the surrender. The army hasbeen quietly resting, taking stock of the prisoners, and sending them tothe railway, and we are expecting every day now the order to advance.The enemy, meanwhile, have been collecting in some force, and areevidently prepared to dispute our march east. Yesterday we had a duelwith a gun which they have managed, goodness knows how, to drag up tothe top of a commanding hill some miles up the river. However, it wastoo strongly placed. We lost several men. The enemy's fire was veryaccurate, and they ended up by sending three shots deliberately oneafter the other right into our ambulance waggons.We shall be able to post letters to-day, and the reason this one is soextremely dirty is that I am finishing it in a drizzling rain, being onpicket guard a couple of miles up the river, not far from the scene ofyesterday's shooting. The Boers are on the bustle this morning. One cansee them cantering about on the plain just across the river, wherethousands of their cattle are grazing. In front the big-gun hillglimmers blue in the mist. Two or three of the enemy have crept up thewoody river-course and tried a shot at us; some close; the bulletsmaking a low, quick whistle as they flit overhead. My twocompanions--there are three of us--are still blazing an indignant replyat the distant bushes. By the amount of fire tap, tap, tapping like anold woodpecker all round the horizon, it seems that there is a suddenwish for a closer acquaintanceship among the pickets generally thismorning. Those fellows in the river are at it again!LETTER XIIIPOPLAR GROVE_March 8_, 1900.We left our camp on Modder River at midnight of the 6th. The night wasclear and starlit, but without moon. Moving down the river to take upour position in the flank march, we passed battalion after battalion ofinfantry moving steadily up to carry the position in front. The plan isthis. The infantry advance up the river as if to deliver a frontalattack; but meanwhile the mounted troops, which have started during thenight, are to make a wide detour to the right and get round at the backof the Boer position, so as to hem them in. The idea sounds a very goodone, but our plans were upset by the Boers not waiting to be hemmed in.However, it is certain that if they _had_ waited we _should_ have hemmedthem in. You must remember that.The guns go rumbling past in the darkness. We are on the right of thecolumn. Along our left we can just distinguish a long, black river offigures moving solidly on. It flows without break or gap. Now and then ajar or clank, the snort of a horse, the rattle of chains, rises abovethe murmur, but underneath all sounds the deep-toned rumbling of thewheels as the English guns go by.Close in front of us is a squadron of Lancers, their long lances,slender, and black, looking like a fringe of reeds against the fastpaling sky, and behind us there is cavalry without end. The morning isbeautifully clear with a lovely sunrise, and that early hour, withhorses fresh, prancing along with a great force of mounted men, alwaysseems to me one of the best parts of the whole show.As soon as we can see distinctly we make out that we have got to thesouth of the enemy's hills, and are marching along their flanks. Theylook like a group of solid indigo pyramids against the sunrise. Arethose kopjes out of range? is a question that suggests itself as we drawalongside, leaving them wide on our port beam. Yes, no! No! a lock ofsmoke, white as snow, lies suddenly on the dark hillside, followed byfifteen seconds of dead silence. Then comes the hollow boom of thereport, and immediately afterwards the first whimper, passing rapidlyinto an angry roar of the approaching shell, which bursts closealongside the Lancers. "D----d good shot," grunts the next man to me,with sleepy approval, as indeed it is.The order to extend is given, but before the Lancers can carry it outthe smoke curl shows again, and this time the shell comes with a yell oftriumph slosh into the thickest group of them, and explodes on theground. There is a flutter of lances for an instant round the spot, andthe head and mane of a shot horse seen through the smoke as it rears up,but the column moves steadily on, taking no notice, only now it inclinesa little to the right to get away from that long-range gun.We march on eastward as day broadens, through a country open andgrassy, rising and falling in long slopes to the horizon. Suddenly fromthe far side of one of these ridges comes the rapid, dull,double-knocking of the Mausers. The enemy are firing at our flankers;these draw back under cover of the slope, and we continue to advance,the firing going on all the time, but passing over our heads. Now theMajor, curious as to the enemy's position, sends half-a-dozen of ourtroop up the slope to get a view. These ride up in open order, and areat once made a mark of by the Boer riflemen, luckily at long range.Wing, wing, with their sharp whirring note, came the bullets. They takea rapid survey and return to tell the Major that the scenery in thatdirection is exceptionally uninteresting, a long slant of grassstretching up for a mile or more, and somewhere about the sky-line Boersshooting. Then comes the usual interval while we wait for "the guns."The guns shortly arrive and a brace of Maxims. These open a hot fire atthe top of the hill. They are rather in front of us, and fire back upthe slope across our front; the bullets passing sound like the rushingof wind through grass.After a bit the order is given to take the hill, and we advance firingas we go. Beyond the guns and Maxims other men are moving up. You noticethat the Colonials shoot as sportsmen do. The regulars blaze away allthe time, seeing nothing, but shooting on spec at the hill top; load andshoot, load and shoot, as hard as they can. Our fellows have a likingfor something to shoot at. With their carbines at the ready, they walkquickly forward as if they were walking up to partridges. Now a man seesa head lifted or the grass wave, and instantly up goes the carbine witha crack as it strikes the shoulder. Another jumps up on to an anthill toget a better view. Every time an extra well directed shell falls amongthe prostrate Boers, one or two start up and run back, and noticingthis, several of the Guides wait on the guns, and as each shell screamsoverhead on its way to the hill top, they stand ready for a snapshot._Wang_! goes the shell, up leaps a panic-stricken Dutchman, and crack,crack, crack, go half-a-dozen carbines. Though absolutely without cover,the enemy keep up for some time a stubborn reply, and when at last wereach the crest, tenanted now only by a few dead bodies, we have lostnearly two precious hours. Below across the vast plain the Dutch are infull retreat. It is doubtful already if we shall be able to interceptthem.The doubt is soon decided against us. We are crossing the flat, kopjesin front and a slope on the right. Suddenly several guns open from thekopjes ahead, the shells dropping well among us. At this coarsebehaviour we pause disgusted. An A.D.C. galops up. We are to make a_reconnaissance_ (hateful word!) on the right to see if the slope isoccupied. "Will the Guides kindly ...?" and the officer waves his handairily towards the hill and bows. We are quite well aware that the slopeis occupied, for we have seen Boers take up their position there, andseveral experimental shots have already been fired by them. However,"anything to oblige" is the only possible answer, and the squadronright wheels and breaks into a canter. Once on the rise the bullets comewhizzing through our ranks quick enough. Down goes one man, thenanother, then another. Maydon of the _Times_, who is with us, drops, butonly stunned by a grazing bullet, as it turns out. The Life Guardsdeploying on our left catch it hot, and many saddles are emptied.A charge at this time would have scattered the Boers instantly (theywere very weak) and saved both time and lives. Instead of this, however,it is thought more advisable to keep every one standing still in orderto afford a more satisfactory test of Boer marksmanship. It is veryirksome. The air seems full of the little shrill-voiced messengers. Ourponies wince and shiver; they know perfectly well what the sound means.At last the fact that the hills are held is revealed to the sagacity ofour commanders, and we are moved aside and the guns once more come intoaction.It is easy (thank goodness!) to be wise after the event. I find everyone very discontented over this action, and especially the cavalry partof it. Had we made a good wide cast instead of a timid little half-cockmovement, and come round sharp, we should have intercepted the Boerconvoy. As it is, we lose two more hours at this last stand which bringsus till late in the afternoon, and soon afterwards, on approaching theriver, we see five miles off the whole Dutch column deliberatelymarching away eastward. Our failure stares us in the face, and we seewith disgust that we have been bluffed and fooled and held in check allday by some sixty or eighty riflemen, while the main body, waggons,guns, and all, are marching away across our front. "The day'sproceedings," says one of our officers to me with laughabledeliberation, "afford a very exact representation of the worst possibleway of carrying out the design in hand."LETTER XIVBLOEMFONTEINMy last letter was written after Poplar Grove, and we marched in heresix days later on the 13th. Of the fighting on the way I can give you noaccount, as I was knocked up with a bad chill and had to go with theambulance. Unluckily we had two nights of pouring rain, and as I hadleft behind my blanket and had only my Boer mackintosh (with the redlining), I fared very badly and got drenched both nights and very cold.This brought on something which the doctor described as "not realdysentery." However, whatever it was (or wasn't), it made me as weak asa baby, and I was transferred to our ambulance, in which I lay,comfortable enough, but only vaguely conscious of my surroundings.The next day, the 10th, they fought the battle of Spytfontein. All Iremember of it was some shells of the Boers falling into the long riverof convoy which stretched in front of me in an endless line, and thehuge bullock and mule waggons wheeling left and right and coming backacross the veldt, with long bamboo whips swaying and niggers utteringdiabolical screams and yells. We lost a good many men, but did fairlywell in the end, as our infantry got into the enemy among some hills,where there were not supposed to be any enemy at all, and cut them up agood deal.The following day I made the march on a bullock-waggon, which is reallya very fine and imposing way of getting along. Your team of twentystrong oxen, in a long two-by-two file, have a most grand appearance,their great backs straining and the chain between taut as a bar, and theview you get over the field from your lofty perch among the piled-upkits and sacks is most commanding. There used to be an old print at homeof Darius at the head of the Persian host "o'erlooking all the war" fromthe summit of some stately chariot or other, which much reminded me ofmy present position. I managed to mount my pony to ride intoBloemfontein, which we did on the 13th, and am now quite well.This morning I sent you a wire to tell you that I had got my commission,thinking thereby to impress you with the importance of the event. Thepast five months of trooper life have not passed unpleasantly. Therehave been the inconveniences and hardships of the moment, "les petitesmiseres de la vie militaire," which sound trifling enough, but arerather a tax on one's endurance sometimes. The life of a trooper, andespecially of a scout, is often a sort of struggle for existence insmall ways. You have to care for and tend your pony, supplement hismeagre ration by a few mealies or a bundle of forage, bought or beggedfrom some farm and carried miles into camp; watch his going out andcoming in from grazing; clean him when you can, and have an eye alwaysto his interests. Your life and work depend so entirely on your ponythat this soon becomes an instinct with you. Then there are your ownwants to be supplied. You will be half starved often if you can't raisesomething to put in your pocket--eggs from a Kaffir, or a fowl, or aloaf of bread. Then there is the cooking question. Wood is scarce;unless you or your pal have an eye to this, you may go supperless forwant of a fire. Another scarcity is water. Very likely there will benone nearer than a mile from camp, and this means a weary tramp after along day. Then what about your bedding? You can carry only a blanket orgreatcoat on your horse, so that, when you are away from your convoy,which is often enough, you have not much covering, and if it comes on torain you have a poor time of it. Of clothes, too, you have only what youride in. If wet, they dry on you; and few and far between are yourchances of washing them. All these things sound and are trifles. A manwould think little of them in a sporting expedition in the Himalayas;but after a long time the monotony tells. The heat tells. You aresometimes "a bit slack," and at those times the cooking of your wretchedmorsel of flesh, or the struggle for a drop of pea-soup coloured waterbecomes irksome.The little star on your shoulder saves you from all that. You can tellthe new commissioned man by the way he has of constantly looking overhis shoulder. Poor fellow! he likes to catch the pretty glitter--the"twinkle, twinkle, little star"--that lifts privates' hands to him asthey pass. Some one else cooks for him now, and there is the officers'mess cart with a few welcome extras and a merry gathering at meals and abatman to tend the pony (though you keep an eye on that yourself too),and extra clothes and blankets, and a shelter of some sort to sleepunder, and a Kaffir boy to put out his washing things when he comes inhot and tired, and altogether life seems, by comparison, a veryluxurious and pleasant affair. I am a bit of a democrat, as you know,and all for equality and the rights of man; but now I say, like Mesty,when they made him a butler, "Dam equality now I major-domo."Bloemfontein is a pretty little place, but it takes you by surprise. Thecountry round is, for endless leagues, so barren, a mere grassy,undulating expanse of prairie land, with a few farms at ten-mileintervals, that the appearance of a town seems incongruous. All of asudden you come to a crowd of low bungalow-like roofs under the shadowof some flat-topped kopjes and realise the presence in this void of theFree State capital.The place is suggestive, in its low single storey houses and prettygardens, of quiet ease, and has a certain kindliness about it. It ispleasant to see the creeper grown fronts and flower patches, and fewshady trees after our long sojourn in the veldt. But the one memorablesight of the place, the scene of a special and unique interest, is theBloemfontein Club. This is the first time that the great army under LordRoberts has found itself in occupation of any town, and the first time,therefore, that all its various contingents have had a chance of meetingtogether in one place. At the Bloemfontein Club the chance has occurred,and certainly never before, in any time or place, could you have seensuch representative gatherings of the British race from all parts ofthe world as you will see if you stroll any day into the verandah andsmoking-room and bar of the Bloemfontein Club. From the old country andfrom every British colony all over the world these men of one race, in acommon crisis, here for one moment meet, look into each others' faces,drink, and greet and pass on; to be drawn back each to his own quarterof the globe and separated when the crisis is passed and not to meetagain. But what a moment and what a meeting it is, and what adistinction for this little place. Organise your mass meetings and packyour town-halls, you never will get together such a sample of theBritish Empire as you will see any afternoon in this remote pothouse.What would you give for a peep at the show; to see the types and hearthe talk? You would give a hundred pounds, I daresay. I wish I couldtake you one of these afternoons: I would do it for half the money.You can see the great mountain of Thaba Nchu quite clearly from here,though it is forty miles away, and trace every ravine and valley in itssteep sides, defined in pure blue shadows. We have been out there theselast ten days on what is known as a "bill-sticking" expedition;distributing, that is, a long proclamation which Lord Roberts has justissued, in which he explains to the Free State Burghers that all theirproperty will be respected, and they will be allowed themselves toreturn to their farms forthwith if they will just take a little quietoath of allegiance to the British Crown. A few have done so and receivedpasses, but the interest taken in the scheme seems less on the wholethan one would have supposed likely. Some explain it by saying that theBoers are such liars themselves that they can't believe but what theEnglish are lying too; while others think the move is premature, andthat the Free State is not prepared yet to abandon the war or herallies.We were by way also of endeavouring to cut off any stray parties ofBoers who might be making their way north from Colesberg and thatneighbourhood. Broadwood was in command of us. There was a stray party,sure enough, but it was 7000 strong. It passed across our bows, fifteenmiles east of us, and we let it severely alone.Meantime there is a general lull. In the midst of war we are in peace. Iam going off to-morrow to our old original Modder River camp (havingridden in from Thaba Nchu yesterday), that cockpit where so muchfighting was done and where we spent so many weary weeks watching theheights of Magersfontein, to get luggage and things left behind. It willbe strange to see the old place deserted and to ride near the hillswithout being shot at. Buller is peacefully sleeping at or nearLadysmith; the sound of his snoring faintly reaches us along the wires.Gatacre slumbers at Colesberg. Kitchener has disappeared, no one knowsexactly where; and Little Bobs has curled himself up at Government Househere, and given orders that he is not to be called for a fortnight. Whatnews can you expect in such times? There is positively none.Bloemfontein gives one the curious impression just now of a town thathas been unpacked and emptied of all its contents, and had them dumpeddown on the land alongside. The shops contain little or nothing. Theyhave been bought up and have not had time to restock. But outside thetown, on the veldt, a huge depot of all sorts of goods is growing largerand larger every day, as the trains, one after another, come steamingnorth with their loads of supplies. There is a street, ankle deep inmud, of huge marquees, each with a notice of its contents outside:"Accoutrements," "Harness," "Clothing," "Transit Store," and what not.Behind and between are vast piles of boxes, bales, bags, and casksheaped up, and more arrive every hour on loaded trucks along a branchrail from the station. It is a busy, animated scene. Orderlies run orgallop about; quartermasters and adjutants and others hurry here andthere, with their hands full of papers from one marquee to another,collecting their orders; shopping as it were, but shopping on rather alarge scale; and the big ox-waggons come creaking along and churning upthe mud. This is where the cost of a war comes in. These are a few ofthe little things that our army will require on its way to Pretoria.There will be money to pay for this. We shall feel this some day, youand I.And poor unstuffed Bloemfontein lies there empty. There are all theshops, and here all the merchandise. You may guess that the tradesmenare indignant. Never has there been such a market. Here is the wholeBritish army clamouring for all kinds of things; most furiously perhapsfor eatables and drinkables, baccy and boots. All these things have longbeen bought up, and the poor Tommies can only wander, sullen andunsated, up and down the streets and stare hungrily in at the emptyshop windows; while out of the empty shop windows the shopkeeper glaresstill more hungrily at them. I have heard how in the Fraser River thefish positively pack and jostle as they move up. So here; but theunhappy sportsman has nothing to catch them with. Brass coal-scuttlesand duplex lamps are about all that remains in the way of bait, andthese are the only things they won't rise to. He rushes off toKitchener. "Give me a train a day. Give me a train a week." "You bed----d," growls Kitchener. Back he comes. The hungry eyes are stillstaring. Incarnate custom flows past. Never in all his life will such achance recur. Poor wretch! It is like some horrible nightmare.LETTER XVMODDER REVISITEDBLOEMFONTEIN, _April 9_, 1900.All the way from Modder River down the Kimberley line and up the centralone from Naauwpoort, the most dismal rumours reached me at all stations,growing more definite as I neared Bloemfontein. Sanna's Post andReddersberg! You have heard all about them by now. Nearly 1000casualties and seven guns taken.You remember I told you in my last letter that a big body of Boersmarched north across our bows. Pilcher was out on that side and drewback. The Boers got wind of him, and wheeled west in pursuit. Broadwood,not strong enough to hold Thaba Nchu, moved in on Bloemfontein, theBoers after him.It is no fun describing things one has not seen. The ground I know. Itis a flat plain the whole way, but down the middle of it is a deep sluitor watercourse, some thirty feet deep, with steep, sudden banks, andthrough this the road dips down and passes. Broadwood halted on the eastside of it, thus leaving it between himself and home. In doing this hegave a chance to an enemy who never throws a chance away. The Boerleader was Christian De Wet.The first thing in the morning the enemy began shelling our camp. Theconvoy was sent on, not a scout with it. Meantime, during the nightseveral hundred Boer marksmen had been sent round into the sluit, andwere now lying right across poor Broadwood's retreat. The Boers, actingwith their devilish coolness as usual, took possession of the waggonswithout giving the alarm. Our two batteries and Roberts' Horse camealong, and were allowed to get to point-blank distance, and then thevolley came; magazine rifles at pistol-shot range. For the moment theresult, as at Magersfontein, was chaos.Hornby dealt the first counter-blow. With the five manageable guns hegalloped back a bit and brought them into action at 1000 yards. Heshowed first that it was going to be a fight and not a stampede. "Steadyand hit back," said Q Battery. You should hear the men talk of thatbattery. It lost almost every man, killed or wounded, but it was thechief means in restoring some sort of order to the retreat. But thedisaster was past retrieving. In killed, wounded, and prisoners we losta third of our force, the whole convoy, and seven guns out of twelve. Ican see the question you are dying to ask. Why on earth did Broadwoodcamp the wrong side of that ditch? That is exactly the sort of questionthat a "blooming civilian" would ask. And then came Reddersberg and theloss of another five hundred. Christian De Wet again! And all thiswithin hearing, as you may say, of the main British army.These disasters come most inopportunely for us. Many of the Orange FreeState Burghers, when their capital was taken, seem to have thought itwas all up and some of them took the oath. But this right and left of DeWet's has changed that impression. It comes just in time to fan into afresh blaze embers that seemed dying out. We hear that all the farmerswho had taken the oath are under arms again. They had not much choice,for the fighting Boers simply came along and took them.My visit to old Modder River was very interesting. It was quitedeserted; only a few odds and ends of militia, where, when I remember itlast, there were stately great squares of ordered tents and long linesof guns and limbers and picketed horses, and the whole place crawledwith khaki, and one felt around one all the bustle and energy of a hugecamp. I felt quite melancholy, as when one revisits some scene ofchildhood changed beyond recall. Trains were running regularly up toKimberley and ordinary citizens were travelling up and down. It seemedthe war was forgotten. To me, who had been living in the head and frontof a big army for seven months, all these old signs of peace and a quietlife seemed strange enough. There were some children going up with theirpapas and mamas. As we came one after another to the lines of hills atBelmont and Graspan they pointed and crowded to the windows, and papabegan to explain that the great fights had been here, and to tell allabout them, quite wrong.The hills look peaceful enough now. The children press their noses andlittle india-rubber fingers against the glass, and chatter and laugh andbob up and down--    "Little they think of those strong limbs    That moulder deep below."And I sit back in my corner ashamed of my dirty old tunic and the holesin it, and peer between two small flaxen heads at hills I last saw alivewith bursting shell.At Modder village I hired a horse and rode across the plain toMagersfontein. I must often have described the place to you--the greatflat and the beak of hill, like a battleship's ram, thrust southwardinto it. Do you know, I felt quite awestruck as I approached it. Itseemed quite impossible that I, alone on my pony, could be going to rideup to and take single-handed that redoubtable hill, which had flung backthe Highlanders, and remained impregnable to all our shelling. I thoughtsome Boer, or ghost of a Boer, would pop up with his Mauser to defendthe familiar position once more. However, none did. I picked my waythrough the trench, littered with scraps of clothing and sacks andblankets, with tins and cooking things, and broken bottles and all sortsof rags and debris littered about. The descriptions of the place senthome after the battle are necessarily very inaccurate. Those I have seenall introduce several lines of trenches and an elaborate system ofbarbed wire entanglements. There is only one trench, however, and nobarbed wire, except one fence along a road. There are, however, a greatnumber of plain wire strands, about ten yards long perhaps, made fastbetween bushes and trees, and left dangling, say, a foot from theground. They were not laid in line, but dotted about in every direction,and, in anything like a dim light, would infallibly trip an advancingenemy up in all directions. The single trench is about five feet deep,the back of it undercut so as to allow the defenders to sleep in goodshelter, and the number of old blankets and shawls lying here showed ithad been used for this. It followed closely the contour of the hill,about twenty yards from its base. Eastward it was continued across theflat to the river.The "disappearing guns," in the same way, were not disappearing at all.They simply had strong redoubts of sandbags built round them, theopening in front being partly concealed by bushes. On each side of thegun, inside the redoubt, was a pit, with a little side passage ortunnel, where two or three gunners could lie in perfect security, andyet be ready at an instant's notice to serve their gun. As for thekopjes themselves, every rock and stone there was split with shell andstarred with bullet marks. The reverse side of the slopes were steepenedwith stone walls here and there, as a protection against shrapnel, andsangars and lookout places were built at points of vantage. Altogether,though not so elaborate as one had been led to believe, the defencesstruck one as extremely practical and business-like.I stayed there for two interesting hours. You can guess with whatfeelings I looked down on the plain from Long Tom's redoubt, poor oldJoey's rival, and traced the long line of the river, with its fringe ofwillows, and marked, up and down, a score of places where we hadskirmished or hidden, distinguishing the positions of our guns andpickets, and all the movements and manoeuvres of our army. For thefirst time one realised what a bird's-eye view the Boers had of it all,and how our whole position and camp lay unrolled like a map almost attheir very feet.I must add a word to tell you that the boxes have arrived! I only wishyou could have been here to see the contents distributed. First (thiswas about a week ago) came a huge box full of good things to eat,raisins, figs, a great many tins of cocoa and milk, chocolate, and otherthings. We spread them all out on sheets in the verandah of the farm inlittle heaps, and very pretty and tempting they looked, the white sheetsdown the shady verandah, and little piles of sweetmeats and thingsdotted all over them. Each man drew a ticket and chose his eatable, someputting it carefully away, others bolting it immediately. One can getabsolutely nothing in Bloemfontein, and the men were as keen as schoolchildren. It was an excellent idea sending such a lot of figs andraisins. They are soon gone, but they are so immensely appreciated whilethey last; they give the men the badly wanted holiday feeling. I almostthink that, in the way of provisions, delicacies are more liked by menon service, and really do them more good than the more practicallyuseful things.Then, a day or two ago, came another great box full of clothing. Flannelshirts, socks, under-clothing, &c. There was, especially, in this box, apacket of little handkerchiefs with a card, and on it written: "Workedby Mrs. Hope and her little girls for the soldiers." The little presenttouched us all very much. I have kept the card with the intention ofthanking "the little girls" if ever I get the chance.We are only about a hundred strong now, and there were enough things togo round several times. If you had foreseen and planned the date oftheir arrival they could not have reached us at a more opportune moment.The men have scarcely anything to wear, for all our kit and clothes,everything we possess, was lost at the Sanna Post surprise party. Iassure you they are grateful. I read them the names of the subscribers,and they all send their best thanks. Several came up to me and askedthat their thanks might be sent to you for your trouble in getting thesubscriptions, &c. No money that could have been expended in any charitycould have been better spent than this. The men have done fearfully hardwork, and were many of them literally in rags. It has been the greatesthelp. The Major has sent you a few words of thanks, but has asked me towrite more particularly. You will let those know who have helped, willyou not, how this Colonial corps of ours has appreciated your Englishpresent.And now, farewell. They say we move forward in a week. I hope it may betrue. They also say we shall finish the campaign in a couple of months.Fiddle-de-dee! is what I say. Tell H. to educate little S. as a scoutamong the Devonshire hedges, and give him a bit of practical trainingagainst the time he will be old enough to come out. There will be Boersto take him on.LETTER XVIJUSTIFICATION OF THE WARBLOEMFONTEIN, _April_, 1900.Yes, certainly, my own reason for fighting is plain and strong. I amfighting for a united South Africa. A united South Africa will, in myopinion, justify the war. The Boers are genuinely patriotic, I haven't adoubt. They have every right and reason to fight to the last for theirfreedom and independence. But the continued existence of independentStates on the pattern of the Dutch republics in the midst of SouthAfrica is bound to be a perpetual irritation. The development of theresources of the country will be checked. The effort to remain separateand apart has obliged, and will more and more oblige, these States tobuild themselves round with a whole system of laws specially directed tohamper immigration; and the richer are found to be the resources of thecountry, the more harassing and stringent will this system of laws haveto become. In fact, in this great, free, and undivided country, to hedgea State round with artificial barriers of this sort, in order that itmay enjoy a kind of obsolete, old-fashioned independence of its own,soon becomes intolerable. It is unjust to all the rest of the continent.The country, if it is to have its due weight and influence in theaffairs of the world, must be united and make itself felt as a whole.It is not fair on such a country, young but rapidly developing, to taketwo of the richest tracts of it right in its midst and to say, "You maygo ahead with the development of all the rest, but these two portionsare to be left on one side, to drop out of the running, to be witheredand useless members, and instead of contributing to the total, andjoining in with the progress of the rest, are to do all in their powerto impede the general advance."It is bad enough when any naturally separate State shows the retrogradetemper and an inability to profit by its own resources, but when thatState is an integral part of one great and young continent, then itsaction becomes intolerable. I think it is not only the people in acountry that have claims, but the country itself that has a claim. Ifyou want South Africa to ripen ultimately into a great first-class worldPower (and that is _its_ claim), instead of a bunch of fifth-rateantagonistic States, the first thing to do is to range the country underone Government, and as a British Government will be progressive, and aDutch one will certainly be retrograde, you must put it under a Britishone. That is the first essential, and if any genuinely patrioticinstincts are overridden in the process, it is very sad, but it cannotbe helped. Better this than that the whole country should miss itsdestiny.As for the Uitlanders and their grievances, I would not ride a yard orfire a shot to right all the grievances that were ever invented. Themass of the Uitlanders (_i.e._, the miners and working-men of the Rand)had no grievances. I know what I am talking about, for I have lived andworked among them. I have seen English newspapers passed from one toanother, and roars of laughter roused by the _Times_ telegrams aboutthese precious grievances. We used to read the London papers to find out_what our grievances were_; and very frequently they would be due tocauses of which we had never even heard. I never met one miner orworking-man who would have walked a mile to pick the vote up off theroad, and I have known and talked with scores and hundreds. And no manwho knows the Rand will deny the truth of what I tell you.No; but the Uitlanders the world has heard of were not these, but theStock Exchange operators, manipulators of the money market, companyfloaters and gamblers generally, a large percentage of them Jews. Theyvoiced Johannesburg, had the press in their hands, worked the wires, andcontrolled and arranged what sort of information should reach England.As for the grievances, they were a most useful invention, and have had ahand in the making of many fortunes. It was by these that a feeling ofinsecurity was introduced into the market which would otherwise haveremained always steady; it was by these that the necessary and periodicslump was brought about. When the proper time came, "grievances," suchas would arrest England's attention and catch the ear of the people,were _deliberately invented_; stories again were deliberately inventedof the excitement, panic, and incipient revolution of Johannesburg, andby these means was introduced that feeling of insecurity I have spokenof, which was necessary to lower prices.Not a finger would I raise for these fellows. And another war-cry whichI profoundly disbelieve in, and which will probably turn out in the longrun to be a hoax, is the "Dutch South Africa" cry. How any one who knowshis South Africa, who knows the isolation of life among the farmers, andthe utter stagnation of all ideas that exists among the people, cancredit the Boers with vaulting ambitions of this sort, is always asurprise to me. I fancy such theories are mostly manufactured for theEnglish market. Naturally I form my opinion more or less from the men inour corps who seem best worth attending to. They, most of them, have anintimate knowledge of the Colony and of one or both of the Republics,and I do not find that they take the "Great Dutch Conspiracy" at allseriously. Some people maintain that, though perhaps the Boer farmersthemselves were not in it, yet their leaders were. But the farmers formthe vast majority of the Boers. They are an independent and stiff-neckedtype; and it is as absurd to suppose that their leaders could pledgethem to such vast and visionary schemes as it is to suppose that suchschemes could have the slightest interest for them. As a matter of fact,what has given old Kruger his long ascendency is the way in which heshares and embodies the one or two simple, dogged ideas of the mass ofthe Burghers. "God bless the Boers and damn the British" are two of thechief of these, but they only apply them within their own borders.But it's a case of the proof of the pudding. If this scheme for ageneral rising existed, why is not the Colony in arms now? What do youthink the answer to that is? Why, that the plot did indeed exist and hadbeen carefully matured, and that it would have come off all right if theBoers had marched boldly south; but that, for some unknown reason, theirhearts failed them at the last moment, and they didn't dare go on andreap what they had sown. "If only they had marched on Cape Town, thewhole Colony would have risen."Doesn't it sometimes occur to you that, when his own interests areconcerned, the Boer is a tolerably wide-awake gentleman, and that heknows how to look after those interests of his almost as well as we canteach him? Are you prepared to believe of him: first, that he laid downand organised this vast conspiracy; second, that he deliberately armedhimself to the teeth with a view of carrying it out; third, that hechose his own time for war and declared it when he thought the momentwas ripe; fourth, that he gained advantages to begin with, and had theColony at his feet; and fifth, that he was seized with a suddenparalysis at the last moment, and found himself unable to march aheadand gather in the recruits who were on tip-toe to join him? No, no. Ifthe plot existed, why didn't the plot work? It had every chance.I will tell you what there was. There were a number of appeals andletters (some of them I have seen) from families in the north to theirrelations in the Colony, praying for sympathy, and perhaps for activehelp. But these were merely personal appeals. There is no hard and fastline, so far as the people are concerned, between the Colony, OrangeFree State, and Transvaal. The same big families, or clans almost, havetheir branches in all three, and probably there is not a family of anyconsequence in either that has not a number of relations in the othertwo. Consequently as war drew closer the excitement and anxiety itcaused spread southward from family to family. There was a good deal ofsympathy felt, no doubt, by the Dutch in the Colony for their relationsfarther north, and there has been surreptitious help, information given,and sympathy. But there the matter has usually ended. There have beenvery few recruits, and there never was an organised conspiracy.It is curious to notice how the several sections of the Dutch werepicked up just as they were laid down. The most determined spirits ofall, the most bitter against English rule, the irreconcilables, hadfought their way farthest north, and formed the Transvaal. South of themcame the Orange Free State, just across the Colony border--independent,but not so bitter; while in the Colony itself remained all those weakerbrethren whose hearts had failed them in the Great Trek days, and whohad remained under our government.The present war has revealed these strata just as they were deposited.The northern State was the leader and aggressor. The southern one, drawnin by its fiercer neighbour, was still true to the cause. And so, too,the Dutch of the Colony were exactly to-day where they had been sixtyyears ago. They could no more join the war than they could join thetrek. And, in spite of individual appeals to relations, &c., you may besure that the northerners knew pretty accurately how the land lay. Theirown action shows this.Therefore, I put aside utterly, so far as I am concerned, the Uitlanderand Dutch conspiracy arguments, of which one hears so much, as thingswhich, though they may occupy the attention of leading article writersin London, yet are not convincing, and have no smack of reality to anyone who knows something about the Uitlanders from personal observation,and something about the Boers and Boer life from personal observation. Iput these aside and come back to the only argument that will reallywash, that has no clap-trap in it. And that is South Africa under oneGovernment, and under a strong and progressive Government. Human natureis pretty much the same all the world over, and if the Boers have beento blame in the past, no doubt the Britons have been just as much toblame. Anyway, it is impossible and would be useless to strike a balancebetween them now. The fact that stands out salient and that has to bedealt with in the present is that South Africa is divided againstitself; that it never can and never will step up into its proper placeuntil it is united, and that, therefore, to fight for a united SouthAfrica is to fight on the right side and in a good cause.And one thing I much like this plain reason for is, that it makes iteasy for one to do full justice to one's adversaries. I admire theircourage and patriotism very much. I acknowledge fully their doggedobstinacy in defence and their dangerous coolness in retreat, and I amsorry for them, too, and think it a sad thing that such brave men shouldbe identified with so impossible a cause. You must be careful how youbelieve the reports sent home by war correspondents. I suppose peoplelike to hear harm of their enemies, and a daily paper's best business isto give the public what the public wants rather than what is strictlytrue. The consequence is that accounts of Boer fighting and of the Boersthemselves (traitors and cowards are the commonest words) are nowappearing which are neither more nor less than a disgrace to the paperswhich publish them. I don't know since when it has become a Britishfashion to slander a brave adversary, but I must say it seems to me asingularly disgusting one, the more so when it is coupled with a grossand indiscriminating praise of our own valour and performances.LETTER XVIITHE MARCH NORTHNEAR JOHANNESBURG, _May 31_, 1900."_May 1st_, 1900.--The long-looked, long-waited for moment has come atlast. We march from Bloemfontein on a glorious autumn morning, in freshcool air and the sky cloudless. Forty miles off Thaba Nchu, that hill ofill omen, might be ten, so bold and clear it stands up above the lowerranges. The level plain between the island hills is streaked with gauzymist."North of Bloemfontein we get into a pretty, uneven country with severallevel-topped kopjes set end to end like dominoes, and thickets of greymimosas clustering in the hollows. The great column is moving forward onour left. Big ambulance waggons, with huge white covers nodding onebehind the other, high above the press; the naval twelve-pounders, withten-oxen teams and sailors swinging merrily alongside; infantry marchingwith the indescribable regular undulation of masses of drilled men,reminding one of the ripple of a centipede's legs; field artillery,horse artillery, transport waggons, more infantry, more guns--theystretch in a long, dark river right across the plain."Now a halt is called. The men drop on one knee where they stand, orhitch up their knapsacks to ease their tired shoulders. Then on again,guns jolting, men sweating, marching at ease, with helmets on wrong sidefirst to shelter their eyes, and rifles with butt-ends over shoulders.They have a rest after a few hours, and fall out by the wayside, flingoff the heavy accoutrements, light pipes, and fall a-yarning, stretchedon the grass, or pull out scraps of old newspapers to read."That was written the day we left Bloemfontein, just a month ago, and 250miles away. We have come along well, have we not?Brandfort is a little town on the railway some forty miles north ofBloemfontein, overlooked by a big rocky kopje on the north. Here we findour dear friends once more assembled to meet us after this longinterval, and we have a little battle with them, of which I will spareyou the description. An incident of some interest was the appearance ofthe "Irish Brigade" from the Natal side, who held the hill above thetown. Rimington got leave from Hutton to turn them out, which he did socleverly, and taking us at them at such a pace that we did the businesswithout loss, except, indeed, in horses, of which several were hit. Idon't know if the two or three prisoners we took (and that we had somethought of shooting out of hand) were a fair sample of the brigade, butfouler-mouthed scoundrels I think I never set eyes on.Our plan of advance has been all along very simple and effective. Ourcentre keeps the railway, while our wings, composed largely of mountedtroops, are spread wide on each side, and threaten by an enclosingmovement to envelop the enemy if he attempts to make a stand. Thesetactics have been perfectly successful, and the Boers have been forcedagain and again to abandon strong positions from a fear of beingsurrounded. A bear's hug gives the notion of the strategy. No sooner doour great arms come round than away slip the Boers while there is stilltime. The Vet River was probably their strongest position, and here theydid make some attempt at a stand. This is how things looked thatmorning:--"_May_ 5_th_, 12.30.--We have just got to the big slopes overlooking VetRiver. The enemy is in a strong position along the river-bed, which isthickly wooded, and in the hills beyond. Our left has touched them, andas I write this our pompon on that side has a couple of goes. Kaffirstell us that the valley is full of Boers. Boers everywhere; in theriver-bed, in the sluits on the far side, in the hills; and that theyhave plenty of guns. It is something like the Modder River position, butstronger, inasmuch as there are ranges of hills on the far side of andoverlooking the river; so that they have two lines of defence, thesecond commanding the first. An excellent arrangement. Walking forwardto the brow, a few of us had the whole panorama at our feet. We had noidea it was so strong, and you might notice a thoughtful look on morethan one face as we walked back to our men behind the hill."We have now got the guns to a nearer rise, sloping to the river, andare standing in extended order waiting for the next move. This will takethe form of artillery practice, and it is prophesied that we shall getit pretty hot, as they will certainly have better guns than ourtwelve-pounders. The sun is melting. Guns unlimber (1.15). Teams jingleback, and the guns open fire from edge of slope, each one as it deliversits shot starting back as if with surprise at its own performance."3 P.M.--Our guns are blazing away merrily now. The Boers, if they haveguns, are very reticent. They have sent us a few shells, which have doneno harm, mostly falling short. Hamilton is said to be at or nearWinburg. If this is so, he will be threatening the retreat of the Boershere soon. Meantime a huge column, miles long, is crawling in thedistance across the flattish grass sweeps far to the east. This is themain column, under Lord Roberts."We thought, you see, that we were in for quite a big fight. We thoughtthe same often later. At this river or this range they will make theirstand. But always, as here at Vet River, we advanced on such a widefront that the enemy had to retire betimes to avoid being outflanked,and so the "stand" was never made. We joined Ian Hamilton at Kronstad,and while we were out with him on the east side the enemy once or twiceattacked our flank or rearguard in the most determined manner. However,we held on our way very composedly, our waggons rumbling along sleepilyindifferent, while the Boers with all their might would be hanging on toour tail. Usually, after we had towed them for a day or two, they wouldlet go, and then another lot would come along and lay hold. The firstparty would then retire to its own village and district, feeling, nodoubt, that it had barked us off the premises in great style, and lay inwait for the next army of ten or twenty thousand men that should happento pass that way.It is the convoy that always hampers our movements so, that dictates theformation of an advance and makes us almost a passive target to attack.Our convoy with Ian Hamilton must have been seven or eight miles long,and was often delayed for hours at fords and creeks, where scenes ofwild confusion took place and you were deafened with yelling Kaffirs andcracking whips. This convoy has of course to be guarded throughout,which means a very attenuated and consequently weakened force, an attackon one part of which might be carried on without the knowledge of therest of the column, or the possibility of its giving much help anyway.When we left Lindley we had a sharp rearguard action, and the Boerspushed their attack very vigorously. They did the same on the rightflank, and the advance guard also had some fighting. Neither of theseparties knew that the others were engaged at all, and probably the bulkof the main column were quite ignorant that a shot had been firedanywhere.Lindley is one of those peculiar, bare, little Dutch towns, the presenceof which on the lonely hillside always seems so inexplicable. It iseven more than usually hideous. There is the inevitable big church, theonly large building in the place, occupying a central position, andlooking very frigid and uninviting, like the doctrine it inculcates; afew large general stores, where you can buy anything from a plough to apennyworth of sweets, and some single-storey, tin-roofed houses orcottages flung down in a loose group. But around it there are none ofthe usual signs of a town neighbourhood. No visible roads lead to it; nofertile and cultivated land surrounds it; no trees or parks or pleasuregrounds are near it. The houses might have been pitched down yesterdayfor all the notice the veldt takes of them. Spread out over the hillsand valleys for some hundreds of miles each side this barren treelessveldt, which, after all, is the main fact of South African life, seemsto carry these little unexpected towns on its breast with the same easeand unconsciousness that the sea carries its fleets of ships;surrounding and lapping at their very hulls; not changed itself norinfluenced by their presence.During our stay of a day or two at Lindley it became increasinglyevident that the people of that neighbourhood resented our presencethere. Our pickets were constantly engaged. There are some rather abrupthills on the east side of the town, among the nearer ones of which ourlook-outs were stationed while the Boers prowled among the others. Herethe Mausers and Lee-Metfords talked incessantly, and the conversationwas carried on in a desultory way down in the river valley and among therolling hills on the southern side. It was plain that the enemy wasquite prepared to "put up a show" for us, and no one was surprised, whenthe morning of our departure came, to see the strong force of MountedInfantry told off for rearguard, or note the presence of the Generalhimself in that part of the field.There are long slanting hills that rise above the village on its southside, the crests of which were occupied by our pickets. As the picketswere withdrawn, the Boers rapidly followed them up, occupied the crestin turn, and began to put in a heavy fire and press hard on ourretreating men.From a square and flat-topped kopje just north of the town we had thewhole scene of the withdrawal down the opposite slopes before our eyes.Our Mounted Infantry were hotly engaged but perfectly steady. They layin the grass in open order, firing, their groups of horses clusteredlower down the hill; then retired by troops and set to work again. Thisgiving ground steadily and by degrees is a test of coolness andsteadiness, and it was easy to see that our men were under perfectcontrol. At last they came under the protection of our hill. We had gotour battery of guns up it, and it was a moment of great satisfaction toall concerned, except possibly the Boers, when the first angry roar roseabove the splutter of rifles, and the shell pitched among some of theforemost of the enemy's sharpshooters. In a duel of this sort theinterference of artillery is usually regarded as decisive. Guns, aspeople say, have "a moral effect" that is sometimes out of proportion tothe actual damage they inflict. Anyway, skirmishers seldom advanceunder gun-fire, and the Boers on this occasion were decisively checkedby our battery. Even when the guns left, we were able from thevantage-ground of the hill to keep them at arm's length until the timecame to catch up the column.On the right flank they were more successful, pressing home a heavyattack on the Mounted Infantry on that side. A squadron got cut off andrushed by the enemy, who rode in to it shooting at pistol-shot distance,and shouting "Hands up!" We lost pretty heavily in casualties, besidesabout fifty prisoners. These small mishaps are of no great importance inthemselves, but they encourage the enemy no doubt to go on fighting. Thestory as it goes round the farms will lose nothing in the telling.Probably in a very short time it will amount to the rout of Hamilton'scolumn, and the captured troopers will lend a colour to the yarn.Burghers who have taken the oath of allegiance will be readier than everto break it. However, time no doubt will balance the account all rightin the long-run.From Lindley, fighting a little every day, we marched north to Heilbron,where Broadwood got hold of the Boer convoy by the tail, and succeededin capturing a dozen waggons. From there we cut into the railway, andcrossed it at Vredefort, passing through the main body of the advance indoing so. Anything like the sight of these vast columns all pushing inone direction you never saw. In this country one can often see thirty orforty miles, and in that space on the parched, light-coloured groundyou may see from some point of vantage five or six separate streams ofadvance slowly rolling northward, their thin black lines of convoyoverhung by a heavy pall of dust. As we closed in and became involvedfor a moment in the whole mass of the general advance, though accustomedto think no small beer of ourselves as an army, for we number 11,000men, we realised that we were quite a small fraction of the Britishforce. Endless battalions of infantry, very dusty and grimy, but goinglight and strong (you soon get into the habit of looking attentively atinfantry to see _how they march_); guns, bearer-companies, ColonialHorse, generals and their staffs, go plodding and jingling by in aprocession that seems to be going on for ever. And beside and throughthem the long convoys of the different units, in heavy masses, comegroaning and creaking along, the oxen sweating, the dust whirling, thenaked Kaffirs yelling, and the long whips going like pistol-shots. Thewhole thing suggests more a national migration than the march of anarmy. And ever on the horizon hang new clouds of dust, and on distantslopes the scattered advance guards of new columns dribble into view. Ifancy the Huns or the Goths, in one of their vast tribal invasions, mayhave moved like this. Or you might liken us to the dusty pilgrims onsome great caravan route with Pretoria for our Mecca.We crossed the Vaal at Lindiquies Drift, being now on the west flank,and met the Boers the day before yesterday two miles from here on theWest Rand. The fight was a sharp one. They were in a strong position onsome ridges, not steep, but with good cover among stones and rocks. Wecame at them from the west, having made a circuit. Our advance washidden by the rolling of the ground, but the enemy guessed it, and senta few shells at a venture, which came screaming along and buriedthemselves in the ground without doing much damage that I could seebeyond knocking a Cape cart to pieces. By 2 P.M. we had crawled up thevalley side and got several batteries of artillery where they couldshell the Boer position. The two great "cow-guns," so called from thelong teams of oxen that drag them, were hauled up the slope. The enemygot an inkling of our intention now, and his shells began to fall moreadjacent. Then our fire began. It was difficult to see clearly. The drygrass of the veldt, which is always catching fire, was burning betweenus and the Boers; long lines of low smouldering fire, eating their wayslowly along, and sending volumes of smoke drifting downward, obscuringthe view. Half the ground was all black and charred where the fire hadbeen; the rest white, dry grass. The Boer position was only about twomiles from our ridge; a long shallow hollow of bare ground, without bushor rock, or any sort of cover on it, except a few anthills, separatingus from them. Our field-batteries opened, and then the great five-inchcow-guns roared out. We ourselves were close to these with Hamilton (weare acting as his bodyguard), and with the other officers I crept up tothe ridge and lay among the stones watching the whole show. After a shotor two all our guns got the range, a mere stone's throw for the greatfive-inchers. Their shrapnel burst along the rise, and we could see thehail of bullets after each explosion dusting the ground along the topwhere the Boers lay. The enemy answered very intermittently, mostly fromtheir Long Tom far back, which our big guns kept feeling for. I neverheard anything like the report of these big guns of ours and the shriekof the shells as they went on their way.After the cannonade had been kept up for a bit, the infantry began theiradvance. This was, I think, the finest performance I have seen in thewhole campaign. The Gordons did it; the Dargai battalion. They came up,line by line, behind our ridge and lay down along with us. Then, at theword "Advance," the front line got up and walked quietly down the slope,and away towards the opposite hill, walking in very open order, withgaps of about fifteen yards between the men. A moment or two would pass.Then when the front line had gone about fifty yards, the "Advance" wouldagain be repeated, and another line of kilted men would lift themselvesleisurely up and walk off. So on, line behind line, they went on theirway, while we watched them, small dark figures clearly seen on the whitegrass, through our glasses with a painful interest. Before they hadreached half way across, the vicious, dull report, a sort of double"crick-crack," of the Mausers began. Our guns were raining shrapnelalong the enemy's position, shooting steady and fast to cover theGordons' advance; but the Boers, especially when it comes to endurance,are dogged fellows. They see our infantry coming, and nothing will movethem till they have had their shot. Soon we can see the little puffs ofdust round the men, that mark where the bullets are striking. All thefurther side, up the long gradual slope to the Boer rocks, has beenburnt black and bare, and the bullets, cutting through the cinders,throw up spots of dust, that show white against the black. Men here andthere stagger and fall. It is hard to see whether they fall from beinghit, or whether it is to shoot themselves. The fire gets faster andfaster, our guns thunder, and through the drifting smoke of the veldtfires we can still see the Gordons moving onward. Then among thelooking-out group, crouched near the guns, goes a little gasp and mutterof excitement. We catch on the black background, glistening in the sun,the quick twinkle of a number of little steel points. They are fixingbayonets! Now the little figures move quicker. They make for the leftside of the ridge. A minute more, and along the sky-line we see themappear, a few at first, then more and more. They swing to the right,where the enemy's main position lies, and disappear. There is a sharp,rapid interchange of shots, and then the fire gradually lessens and diesaway, and the position is captured. They have lost a hundred men in tenminutes, but they've done the trick.Later on, Hamilton, one of the most beloved of our Generals, gallopsforward, and on the hill they have won, as evening is closing, says afew words to the Gordons. "Men of the Gordons, officers of the Gordons,I want to tell you how proud I am of you; of my father's old regiment,and of the regiment I was born in. You have done splendidly. To-morrowall Scotland will be ringing with the news." This charge will, no doubt,take rank as one of the most brilliant things of the war.Next morning at dawn, escorting the cow-guns, I came to where the Boershad held out so long among the scattered rocks. The Gordons were buryingsome of the Boer dead. There were several quite youngsters among them.One was a boy of not more than fourteen, I should think, like an Englishschoolboy. One of the Gordons there told me he saw him, during theadvance, kneeling behind a stone and firing. He was shot through theforehead. There is something pathetic and infinitely disagreeable infinding these mere children opposed to one.These infantry advances are the things that specially show up thecourage of our troops. Each man, walking deliberately and by himself, isbeing individually shot at for the space of ten minutes or more, thebullets whistling past him or striking the ground near him. To walksteadily on through a fire of this sort, which gets momentarily hotterand better aimed as he diminishes the distance between himself and theenemy, in expectation every instant of knowing "what it feels like," isthe highest test of courage that a soldier in these days can give.Nothing the mounted troops are, as a rule, called upon to perform comesnear it. Knowing exactly from experience what lay in front of them,these Gordons were as cool as cucumbers. As they lay among the stoneswith us before beginning the advance, I spoke to several, answeringtheir questions and pointing them out the lie of the ground and theBoer position. You could not have detected the least trace of anxiety orconcern in any of them. The front rank, when the order to advance wasgiven, stepped down with a swing of the kilt and a swagger that only aHighland regiment has. "Steady on the left;" they took their dressing asthey reached the flat. Some one sang out, "When under fire wear acheerful face;" and the men laughingly passed the word along, "Whenunder fire wear a cheerful face."LETTER XVIIIPRETORIAPRETORIA, _June 6_, 1900.It is generally considered rather a coup in war, I believe, to take theenemy's capital, isn't it? like taking a queen at chess. We keep ontaking capitals, but I can't say it seems to make much difference. TheBoers set no store by them apparently; neither Bloemfontein nor Pretoriahave been seriously defended, and they go on fighting after their lossjust as if nothing had happened.For months Pretoria has been our beacon, and at first it seemed quite animpossibly long way off. Looked at from Bloemfontein, across 300 milesof dreary veldt and rugged kopjes and steep-banked rivers, and allowingfor the machinations and devilments of ten or fifteen thousand Boers,our arrival here did seem a vague, indefinite, and far-off prospect. Andyet in a day or two over the month here we are. Lord Roberts has broughtus up in the most masterly way. He has moved with a big central columnon the railway, while at the same time other columns, stretched far toright and left, moved parallel and threatened to outflank and enclosethe enemy at every stand. So with wings beating and body steadilyadvancing, like some great kite or bird of prey, we have flapped our waynorthward.Even here no stand was made. The town is strongly defended with severalnew forts, armed, we were told, with 10-inch guns, with a range of abouttwelve miles, which we supposed would put the noses of our poor cow-gunscompletely out of joint. The Boers had burnt the grass on all the hillsto the south of the town, so that the blackened surface might show upthe khaki uniform of our men, and offer a satisfactory mark, and thingsgenerally, as we slowly approached the tall black rampart of mountainsouth of Pretoria, seemed to point to a big engagement. But here, as sooften elsewhere, it was borne in upon them that if they finally stayedand defended their capital, they would assuredly be surrounded and cutoff; and so, though only at the last moment, we hear, they decided toleave. They put up an afternoon fight on the hills near the town, butthis was only the work of a handful of men, probably intended to staveus off for a while while they finished their packing in Pretoria and gotaway. Lord Roberts got a battery up to the crest of a great big ridge,and we got a pompon up a still steeper one, and a vigorous cannonade waskept up and a good deal of rifle-fire indulged in till nearly dark. Butthis is often very deceptive. No doubt if it was the first battle youhad been at, you would have put down the casualties, judging from thenoise made, at several hundred. As a matter of fact, the peculiar thingabout all this shooting is that, like the cursing in the _Jackdaw ofRheims_, "nobody seems one penny the worse." Loading is now so easy thatit is not the slightest trouble to fire. The consequence is that aglimpse of a Boer's head on the sky-line a couple of miles off willfind work for a battery of guns and a few score of rifles for the restof the afternoon. About sunset time, when it begins to get cold, theywill limber up and come away, and the report will go in that ourshelling was very accurate, but that the enemy's loss could not bepositively ascertained.The day after the fight we made a triumphal procession through Pretoria,and marched past Lord Roberts and his staff, and all his generals andtheir staffs, assembled in the big square facing the Parliament House.We came along a long, straight street, with verandahed houses standingback in gardens, and trees partly shading the road, a ceaseless, slow,living river of khaki; solid blocks of infantry, with measured, eventread, the rifle barrels lightly rising and falling with the elastic,easy motion that sways them altogether as the men keep time; cavalry,regular and irregular, and, two by two, the rumbling guns. Mile aftermile of this steady, deliberate, muddy tide that has crept so far,creeps on now through the Dutch capital. Look at the men! Through longexposure and the weeding out of the weak ones, they are now all pickedmen. The campaign has sorted them out, and every battalion is so muchsolid gristle and sinew. They show their condition in their lean,darkly-tanned faces; in the sinewy, blackened hands that grasp the riflebutts; in the way they carry themselves, with shoulders well back andheads erect, and in the easy, vigorous swing of their step.I should like, while I am about it, to speak to you rather more atlength about the British soldier. I should think my time spent onservice, especially the five months in the ranks, time well spent, ifonly for the acquaintanceship it has brought with soldiers. In thefield, on the march, in bivouac, I have met and associated and talkedwith them on equal terms. Under fire and in action I have watched them,have sat with them, long afternoons by rivers and under trees, andyarned with them on tramps in the blazing sun. Their language, habits,and character have to some extent grown familiar to me.They are not, to begin with, a bit like the description I sometimes readof them in newspapers. In one of Kipling's books there is a descriptionof a painting of a soldier in action; realistic and true to life; dirtyand grimed and foul, with an assegai wound across the ankle, and theterror of death in his face. The dealer who took the picture made theartist alter it; had the uniform cleaned and the straps pipe-clayed, andthe face smoothed and composed, and the ferocity and despair toned downto a plump and well-fed complacency, and made, in fact, all thosealterations which were supposed to suit it to the public taste.The newspapers describe the British soldier, I suppose, to suit thepublic too, much on the same lines. He is the most simpering,mild-mannered, and perfect gentleman. If you asked him to loot a farm,he would stare at you in shocked amazement. He is, of course, "as braveas a lion," his courage being always at that dead level of perfectheroism which makes the term quite meaningless. Except, however, whenthey are shining with the light of battle, his eyes regard all people,friends and foes alike, with an expression of kindness and brotherlylove. He never uses a strong word, and under all circumstances thegentleness and sweet decorum of his manner is such as you would neverexpect to meet outside the Y.M.C.A.This is about as much like our dear, old, real Tommy Atkins as Kipling'sportrait was. Such a likeness does no honour to the man. It is simplylifeless. Whatever Tommy is, he is a man; not a round-eyed, pink-cheekedwaxwork stuffed with bran. The truth is coarse and strong, but he canstand having the truth told about him.Soldiers as a class (I take the town-bred, slum-bred majority, mind) aremen who have discarded the civil standard of morality altogether. Theysimply ignore it. This, no doubt, is why civilians fight shy of them. Inthe game of life they don't play the same rules, and the consequence isa good deal of misunderstanding, until finally the civilian says hewon't play with the Tommy any more. In soldiers' eyes lying, theft,drunkenness, bad language, &c., are not evils at all. They steal likejackdaws. No man's kit or belongings are safe for an instant in theirneighbourhood unless under the owner's eye. To "lift" or "pinch"anything from anybody is one of the Tommy's ordinary everyday interests,a thing to be attended to and borne in mind along with his other dailycares and duties. Nothing is more common than to see some distractedprivate rushing about in search of a missing article, which he declaresin anguished tones he has only just that instant laid down; his ownagitation a marked contrast to the elaborate indifference of every onenear him.As to language, I used to think the language of a merchant ship'sfo'c'sle pretty bad, but the language of Tommies in point of profanityquite equals, and in point of obscenity beats it hollow. This departmentis a speciality of his. Of course, after a little it becomes simplymeaningless, and you scarcely notice it, but the haphazard andindiscriminate way, quite regardless of any meaning, in which heinterlards ordinary sentences with beastly words, at first revolts you.Lying he treats with the same large charity. To lie like a trooper isquite a sound metaphor. He invents all sorts of elaborate lies for themere pleasure of inventing them. He will come back from headquarters andtell you of the last despatch which he has just read with his own eyes(a victory or disaster, according to his mood at the moment), with allkinds of realistic details added; and you go and see for yourself, andthere is no despatch at all. Looting, again, is one of his perpetualjoys. Not merely looting for profit, though I have seen Tommies takepossession of the most ridiculous things--perambulators and sewingmachines, with a vague idea of carting them home somehow--but lootingfor the sheer fun of the destruction; tearing down pictures to kicktheir boots through them; smashing furniture for the fun of smashing it,and may be dressing up in women's clothes to finish with, and dancingamong the ruins they have made. To pick up a good heavy stone and sendit _wallop_ right through the works of a piano is a great moment forTommy. I daresay there is something in it, you know.These are roughish traits, are they not? Sit down by this group ofTommies by the water-hole in the mid-day halt. They are filthy dirty,poor fellows. Their thin, khaki, sweat-stained uniforms are rotting onthem. They have taken off tunics and shirts, and among the rags offlannel are searching for the lice which pester and annoy them. Here isa bit of raw humanity for you to study, a sample of the old Anglo-Saxonbreed; what do you make of it? Are thieving, and lying, and looting, andbestial talk very bad things? If they are, Tommy is a bad man. But forsome reason or other, since I got to know him, I have thought ratherless of the iniquity of these things than I did before.The day has been fearfully hot, as usual, and they have done a longmarch. They were up last night on picket, and have had nothing to eatall day as yet but a biscuit or two and a cup of milkless coffee. Thissort of thing has been going on for months. They are tired and hungryand footsore. More than one falls back where he sits and drops into asleep of utter exhaustion. But of any serious grumbling or discontentthere is no sign. A few curse at the heat perhaps, but their hardshipsare mostly a subject for rough chaff and Cockney jokes. You thought youwere roughing it a good deal, but look at the state these men are in.You gave yourself credit for some endurance, but look at theirunaffected cheeriness. The whole army is the same. In their thousands,as you see them pass, the prevailing expression down all the swarthyfaces is one of unfailing good-humour. They make no more of theirhardships than Sandow of throwing about bars and bells that would crushan ordinary man flat. It dawns on one, the depth of manhood that isimplied in endurance like this. "We sometimes get licked at first, butwe mostly come out all right in the end." Tommy's good-natured face ashe sweats it across the veldt gives some meaning to that boast.In the crowds of his mates in the East End, in crowds of the unemployedand the like, you see the same temper--a sort of rough, good spirits, anindomitable, incorrigible cheerfulness that nothing, no outward misery,seems able to damp. In West End crowds (Hyde Park, for instance) youdon't get this. There are smiles and laughs, as you look about at thefaces, but they seem merely individual--one here, another there. In thecrowd of roughs--though goodness knows there is little cause formerriment, so far as one can see--there is a quite different, deeper,and more universal feeling of bluff cheeriness, not put on, butunconscious, as though, in spite of present misery, things were goingright for them somehow. I should say an East End crowd gave one a fardeeper impression of animal spirits, of hope and cheeriness, than a WestEnd one. And it is the same with soldiers. The officers are finefellows, but in this point they yield to the soldiers.And it means a lot. Of what use is even courage itself if it goes withimpatience and a flash in the pan endurance? This quality ofcheerfulness is really the quality that outlasts all others. It meansnot only that you have an army in good fighting trim to-day, but thatthis time next year, or the year after, you will still have an army ingood fighting trim. In the long-run it wears down all opposition, but itis not a characteristic you notice at first. Gradually it makes itselffelt, and gradually it governs your estimate of the whole army. And thenthe peculiar wickedness of Tommy (a child's naughtiness forsuperficiality) ceases to offend you so much. Rather your own regulationcode seems a trifle less important than it did. Let's all lie and steal;what does it signify? I would lie and steal till the crack of doom togain the serene endurance of the British soldier.[1]Of his courage one need scarcely speak. It is a subject on which a greatdeal of rubbish has been talked. It is not true that all soldiers arebrave, nor is it true that even brave soldiers will go anywhere and doanything. On the other hand, it certainly is true that our soldiers'courage--that is, their apparent unconsciousness of danger--strikes oneas very remarkable. You need not believe more about the _light ofbattle_ and the _warrior's lust_, and all that sort of thing, than youwant to. There is very little excitement in a modern battle, and theEnglish soldier is not an excitable man, but this only makes the displayof courage more striking. Nothing can be more terrible than one of our_slow_ charges, a charge in which all the peril which used to becompressed into a hundred yards' rush in hot blood is spread out over anafternoon's walk. I am sure any man who has ever taken part in one ofthose ghastly processions, and, at thirty yards interval, watched thedust-spots, at first promiscuous, gradually concentrating round him, andlistened to the constant soft whine or nearer hiss of passing bullets,and seen men fall and plodded on still, solitary, waiting his turn,would look upon the maddest and bloodiest rush of old days as a positiveluxury by comparison.What I think about our soldiers' courage is that it is of such a sortthat it takes very little out of them. One of the foreign officers onLord Roberts' staff, in a criticism in one of his own papers, haswritten that the English infantry, more than any he knows, has the knackof fighting and marching and keeping on at it, day after day, withoutgetting stale or suffering from any reaction. The fact is, our Tommiesgo into a fight with much the same indifferent good-humour that they doeverything else with. Towards the end of each day's march the soldiersall begin to look out for firewood, and if at that time you knock upagainst the enemy, you may see our infantry advancing to the attack withbig logs tied to their backs and sticking up over their heads. Though itencumbers and bothers them and makes them much more conspicuous, not aTommy will abandon his wood. Supper is a reality. The thought of beingshot does not bother him. Men who fight like this can fight every day.Taking him altogether, then, your general impression of the Tommy is oneof solid good temper and strength. Of his faults and failings, when youget to know him, you cannot help making light; for his faults are faultsof conduct only, while his strength is strength of character. As anindividual, I daresay you could criticise him, but in the mass, for thestrength of breed he shows and the confidence he gives you in your race,you will have nothing but admiration.I have told you what I could about him, because he is a man you havenever seen, and will probably never have a chance of seeing. For no onewho has not seen Tommy in the field has seen him at all. If you loveEngland, you must love the army. If you are a patriot, not merely aJingo, the sight of these ragged battalions passing will give you such athrill as only very fine and splendid things do give; and very proud youwill feel if ever you have had a hand in sharing their work and beenadmitted to some sort of fellowship with them.These are the lads who in their packed thousands tramped yesterdaythrough Pretoria. Past old Kruger's house, a cottage you might almostcall it, with its lions in front and several old burghers in blackcrying in the verandah, we went at a foot's pace, choking in the cloudof red dust, with the strains of "God Save the Queen" in our ears. Weemerge into the square. The Volksraad is on our right; then the GrandHotel, with all its windows full of English people, or sympathisers withEngland, many of them women, all waving handkerchiefs and raising acracked cheer as we pass. I was staring at all this, whilst a big bandon the right broke merrily out with the "Washington Post," and did notsee till I almost brushed his horse's nose, our Commander-in-Chiefstanding like an amiable little statue at the head of all his generalsand their staffs, with finger raised to helmet. It is quite a moment toremember, and I do really feel for an instant, what all the morning Ihave been trying to feel, that we are what literary people call "makinghistory."As for Pretoria itself, it is a pretty and well-wooded little place,with pink and white oleander trees in blossom, fir-trees, gums, andweeping-willows along the streams and round the little bungalow houses.The shady gardens and cool verandahs give these houses a very invitingair in this land of blazing sun. They have a comfortable, and at thesame time sociable, look, the houses being near by each other, but eachwith a pretty garden and trees overhanging. Like all the works of thesevery practical people, the place is designed for convenience and comfortand not a bit for beauty. But the first two give it the last to someextent, give it a sort of simple and homely beauty of its own which ispleasing as far as it goes."Take heed to thyself, for the devil is unchained." We are told thatChristian De Wet is loose again, and is trifling with our lines ofcommunication. If this is so, our supplies will be cut off, the armywill be starved, and you will never get this letter. There has been apretty general hope that the taking of the capital would mean the end ofthe war. "We have fired our last shot," said some. At least we countedon a good rest. Alas! orders have just come in. Good-bye flowers andshady gardens and dreams of bottled beer and a dinner at the club. Wemarch immediately.Talking of soldiers, here is a soldier's story for you--Officer (to distracted Tommy, fleeing for his life under shower ofbullets): "Dash you! what the dash are you running for?"Tommy, tearing on: "'Cause I ain't got no b----y wings."Here's another--First Tommy: "And the bullets was comin' that thick----"Second Tommy: "Well, but 'adn't you got no ant'ills?"First Tommy: "Ant'ills! Why, there wasn't ant'ills 'nough for theorficers."FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 1: This account is true of a type, but I should not let itstand if I thought it would make the reader forget that, besides these,there are any number of men in the army who lead lives in every waystraight and honourable.]LETTER XIXTHE MARCH SOUTHBETHLEHEM, _July 14_, 1900.Whenever in this campaign we have dealt the enemy what looked like acrushing blow, he has always hit back instantly at us. When Methuenreached the limit of his advance at the Modder River victory, the Boerswere round immediately threatening us from behind. When we tookBloemfontein they at once swarmed round to the east and south, and dealtus two nasty blows at Sanna's Post and Reddersberg; and no sooner had wetaken Pretoria than the same activity was displayed again.They threatened us now from two points. Louis Botha had collected alarge force, and was watching us from the hills east of the town, whilethe everlasting De Wet, far south, was breaking up the railway andburning our letters. The first thing we did, and we did it the very dayafter entering the capital, was to march against Botha. Ian Hamilton haspaid our little corps the compliment of taking it on as his bodyguard.He is a general that inspires every one under him with great confidence.It is curious, by the way, how very soon troops get to know the worth ofa leader; just as a pack of hounds knows by instinct when it is properlyhandled. Outsiders may argue about this or that general, and analysehis tactics, and never very likely get much nearer the truth (for thereis a monstrous lot of luck one way or the other in all manoeuvres, andthe ones often succeed that didn't ought to, and _vice versa_); but onceyou are under a man, you don't need to argue; you know. We all know thatIan Hamilton, with his pleasant well-bred manner, and the mutilated handdangling as he rides, is the best man we have had over us yet, and wewould all do great things to show our devotion.The Diamond Hill action was one of those great big affairs which itwould be impossible to explain without a plan of the country and a lotof little flags. Our attack from extreme left to right was spread over afrontage of, I daresay, twenty miles. The idea was for the mountedtroops to turn the enemy's flanks and let in the infantry in front. IanHamilton had to deal with the Boer left flank, French with the right. Ofcourse we saw and heard nothing of French, who might as well have beenfighting in another planet, so far as we knew. Our difficulty here, ason some former occasions, was to find the limit of their flanks. Themore we stretch out, the more they stretch out. They have the advantageof being all mounted, while the bulk of our force is infantry, massedinertly in the middle; and also from the lofty position they occupy theycan command a bird's-eye view of the wide valley across which we areadvancing, and perceive the disposition of our forces, and in whatstrength we are threatening the various points of defence, while theirforces are quite concealed from us. This is so much in their favourthat, on our flank at least, it is we, and not they, who are threatenedwith being outflanked.Their position could scarcely have been stronger if nature had designedit for the purpose. A low range of hills gives admittance on the westside to a long wide valley, and on the east side of this a steep rockyrange rises boldly up, showing in the sky a level outline like a rampartfringed with wall-like slabs of rock or detached masses, givingexcellent cover from shrapnel. But besides this higher and last line ofdefence, there are some lower hills and slopes which project from themain rampart and command the valley, while they are in turn commanded bythe heights. It is a two-step position, in fact. You carry the lowerstep first, and immediately come under the fire of the upper. TheGeneral told me next day that he thought it as strong as anything he hadseen on the Natal side, and Winston Churchill set the matter at rest bypronouncing it stronger in point of formation than Spion Kop.In the first day's fighting we drove them from the western hills andacross the valley, which was more fertile than usual and full of cover,until we had forced them into the two-step eastern range. My own worklay right out on the flank end, at the very finger-tips, where thefarthest limit of each force was trying to feel a way round the other.Here, with some of the Camerons, we felt about the hills, shelling themwith a couple of guns for Boer sharpshooters, and occasionally flushingone or two. We were rather detached and out of the main action, feelingrather like a gun that has been sent to stop birds from "going back"while the main battue is at work in front. We stayed out all day, and aswe rode in that night to headquarters the whole valley under thestarlight was echoing like a great gallery and bustling with themultitude of our army arranging itself and settling down for the night.We picked our way through the various convoys hurrying forward in searchof their brigades, but often losing their way or getting off the track,checked by muddy fords, where an engulfed team wallows piteously,barring the passage. We pass detachments of infantry hurrying in tiredand silent, and meet other detachments with blankets and greatcoatscoming out on picket. Waifs and strays, by ones and twos, who have losttheir way, shout for guidance, hallooing dismally for the brigades orregiments to which they belong, and which many have small hope ofrejoining that night. Meantime, right down the valley and far across it,the various camp-fires twinkle out like glow-worms. The air is keen andfrosty, and stars, clear and sharp as icicles, glitter all over the sky.Above everything is still and calm, very well arranged evidently, andeverything in its proper place. Below all is confusion, noise, anddarkness, disappointment, and difficulty, vague wandering to and fro,lamentations, and general chaos. They manage these things better upthere! However, after a bit order begins to reign. The several unitsdraw together. The camp-fires are beacons. The waggons struggle up. Thebleating of the lost sheep is gradually hushed, as one by one they findtheir way to their various folds, and slowly, in spite of darkness andbroken ground, the tangle is smoothed out.By a small farm, where the General lodges, blazes a huge fire. Round itgather some staff officers, and among them, recognised from afar, arethe welcome tiger-skins of the Guides' officers. The Major sits by theblaze in that familiar attitude of his, like a witch in "Macbeth," witha wolf-skin karross drawn over his shoulders, and the firelight on hisswarthy face as he turns it up with a grim laugh to chaff the othersstanding round. But there is rather a gloom on the party to-night. Newshas just come in that poor Airlie, charging at the head of his Lancers,has been killed. Many here knew him, and every one who knew him seems tohave been fond of him.Winston Churchill turns up and enlivens us. There are several colonelsand senior officers squatting about, and Churchill takes the opportunityof giving them a bit of his mind. He is much annoyed with the day'sproceedings. He has been a good deal shot at; so has the Duke, and sohas the General. They have had to use their Mauser pistols. This sort ofthing should not happen. Then where was French? Checked, indeed! apretty fine thing! And the Guards? The Guards were somewhere where theyhad no business to be, instead of being somewhere else. Would any onekindly tell him why the Guards were not somewhere else? And Churchill(he has a face like a good-natured child, and looks about fourteen) eyesthe old colonels, who fidget nervously round the fire like disturbedhens. He talks and argues incessantly, but very cleverly. Before he goeshe dashes off a sketch of South Africa's future with a few words aboutfarming and gold-mining. He gives us a cup of hot cocoa all round, whichhe produces from nowhere, like a conjuring trick, re-arranges our fire,tells us when the war will be over, and strolls off (daring the oldcolonels with his eye to so much as look at him) to the farm to give theGeneral his final instructions about to-morrow's action.Next day our infantry established itself on the lower step of the Boerposition, but the final ridge still remained in their hands. It was ading-dong fight between the two, for the positions were withinhalf-rifle shot of each other. However, we could not turn them out,though we got a field-battery right up in the firing line, which crackedshrapnel over them as hard as ever it could load and fire. They haddetermined to hold that ridge till night gave them the opportunity ofmoving off their waggons and guns safely; and hold it they did. No doubtwe could have carried it by storm, but crossing that thousand yards ofopen ground would have meant a terrible loss, and the General did notattempt it. As it was, there was a great deal of banging and blazing,almost like the old Modder days, for a time; guns hard at it, andMausers and Lee-Metfords jabbering away at a great rate, though, as bothsides were under cover, the loss was not heavy. The firing went on tillpitch dark, and we camped close under the ridge we had won. Next morningwe found the ridge vacant, with only heaps of empty cartridge cans andan occasional blood-stain on the rocks to show where our enemy had lain.A little way out from Pretoria there are some very smart-looking newhouses, what they call "villa residences" in England, built in thestyle, a sort of mild and tepid Gothic (what I call grocer's Gothic, forit always reminds me of brown sugar and arrowroot), common aroundwatering-places; small gables sticking out everywhere, till it lookslike a cluster of dog-kennels; walls faced with ornamental tiles andlath and plaster; small shrubberies round, and a name on the gate. Therewere two especially beautiful ones. The General had one and we had theother. Ours was quite new. There was no furniture in it; but this, as wehad been so long without it, we did not miss. But everything we reallyneeded--gorgeous wall-papers, and dados, and polished floors, andelectric-bells, and stained-glass windows--was there. We had hot bathsat the Grand Hotel, and we dined at the club, and we forgot all aboutthe war, and the veldt, and the dust, and the long marches, and the Boerlurking in ambush, and the whispering bullet from the hill. This went onfor two days, and then we marched again, and we have been marching eversince.We left Pretoria on June 19th, and, taking it easy, reached Bethlehem onJuly 9th, doing a bit under 200 miles in the twenty days. The meaning ofthe new scheme begins to dawn on us. Clements and Paget have come upfrom the west; Rundle is down south-west, near Ficksburg; the Basutoborder runs up from there south and south-east, and within the groundthus enclosed we have penned a very considerable force of the enemy,among whom is that Jack-in-the-box, Christian De Wet. We know they arethere, and indeed we have little fights with their scouts every day. Thequestion is, how are we to collar them? The country is very broken andhilly and very extensive.Hunter is looking after us now. Poor Ian Hamilton, as you will know, hadan accident at Heidelberg. His horse put a foot in an antbear's hole,just in front of me as it happened, and came down, flinging the generalforward over his head. I thought he was killed, he lay so still, but itwas only his collar-bone and a bad shaking. He is in the field againnow.Hunter has a great reputation as a fighter, which is rather alarming,especially when we are confronted with such a poisonous country as theone before us now; a medley of big mountain ranges, fantasticallyheaped, stretching thirty miles south to Basutoland, and forming part ofthe great mountain formation that reaches to and culminates in theDrakensberg range. These hills are garrisoned by about 7000 Boers withseveral guns, and De Wet to lead them; altogether a formidable force.There is a saying, that you should not bite off more than you can chew.I hope we have not done that. Hunter looks as if he could chew a goodlot, I think. Still the job is likely to be a difficult one to handle,and if he asks my advice I shall tell him to leave it to Rundle.I should think a life of this sort would be likely to have somepermanent effect on one's mind and intellect. The last mail--that is tosay, the last news of any sort of the outside world--which we havereceived was on April 27th before leaving Bloemfontein; three monthsless a week since any whisper concerning events or people out of ourimmediate sight has reached us. My ignorance of things in general weighson me. It is a taste of life in the dark ages before modern inventionskept one in touch with the world.During all this time we have been wandering like an army in a dream overthe unlimited surface of the veldt. The same programme is repeated dayby day. A little before dawn you hear through your blanket-folds thefirst unwelcome "Saddle up," and the muttered curses in reply. Youunwind yourself with groans. A white-frost fog blots out everything atfifty yards, and a white sugary frost encrusts the grass. These firsthours are piercingly cold, for it is now mid-winter with us. A cup ofwater left overnight is frozen solid. You dress by simply drawing yourrevolver-strap over your shoulder, and flinging your blanket round you,make your way to where a couple of black boys are bending over thebeginnings of a fire, and to which several other blanketed and shiveringfigures are converging with the same thought--_coffee_--in every mind.Then the great army column that has curled itself up like a caterpillarfor the night begins slowly to uncurl. On the march our huge convoystretches out in line, waggon following waggon along the rude track, andextending to a length of nearly ten miles. At night, of course, itcollects (parks is the proper word) at some selected spot where theground is favourable, and where in the shape of a sluit, river, orfarm-dam there is water. On the slopes and hills around infantry picketsare set, while the convoy and main camp are massed in the hollowbeneath. You must not think of our _camp_ in the English sense of theword. We have no tents. The men sleep tightly rolled in greatcoat andblanket, stretched on the bare earth, with saddles for pillows. Ifanything takes you about the camp at night, you might think you werewalking among thick strewn corpses after a fearful carnage, so stiff andstill the frosted bodies lie on the ground.Now the great creature wakes for its next crawl. First its antennae, orlong feelers, are pushed out in front. Its scouts, that is, among which,if you belong to our corps, you will probably find yourself, gocantering on ahead. They pass the pickets on the hill, who promptlyshoulder blankets and turn back to camp, and break into extended order,and throw out little feelers of their own in front and to the sides asthey enter an unexplored country. Following them come several companiesof infantry, a block of solid strength, marching at the top of thecolumn, and a battery or section of guns. Then comes the long line ofconvoy waggons, piled high with provisions, fodder, and kit,strengthened and protected at intervals by companies of infantrymarching at ease, with the two great cow-guns somewhere about themiddle. The tail of the column, like the head, is strengthened by aconsiderable force of infantry, followed at an interval of a mile or soby the mounted rearguard, which has scattered its scouts far and wideacross the track of the column, and withdraws them from point to pointas we advance. Likewise to left and right, far out on the plain, thehorsemen of the flank guards are scattered in little bands of twos andthrees, cantering along or stopping and spying, sniffing cautiouslyround kopjes or peeping into farms, and by-and-by you will probably hearfrom one direction or other a few scattered single shots, and yonder twoscouts in the distance, lately advancing so quietly, are now seen to beturned and galloping back as hard as they can split, while two or threeMausers crack at them from the sky-line.It is a pretty sight, from some hill far in advance, to turn back andwatch the army coming into view. You push on, scouts feeling the way, tooccupy some prominent kopje on the line of march, and climbing up andsitting among the rocks, command with your glasses a view far and wideover the plain. The air has been very cold and sharp, with an intensepenetrating cold hitherto, but now the sun is shining and its mellowwarmth is instantly felt. The rich pure colour-lines, only seen when thesun, rising or setting, is low in the sky, lie straightly ruled acrossthe plain, brown and orange and pale yellow, and in the distance blue.The ten-mile off rocks look but a mile in this air. Every object,distant or near, is exact to the least detail. So clear are the outlinesyou would think there was no atmosphere here at all, and that you mightbe looking out over the unaired landscapes of the moon. One would thinkthat such an air would breed an exceptional race, and that the men, andhorses too, for that matter, of this country would show something of theArab character, sensitive, fiery, and high strung. Yet nothing can beconceived less Arab like than your stolid but practical Dutchman and theunderbred screw he rides.Left and right of you, your two or three flankers, half a mile off, havehalted, in obedience to your halting, and are standing by their horses'heads scanning the country. Under the kopje your main body are sittingabout, while their ponies, with bridles thrown over their heads, graze.Far back, two or three miles, the bits of dark kilt showing behind theirkhaki aprons, a company of the Camerons comes into view, the browncolour so exactly matching the plain that they are first visible only bytheir motion. Here come the flank guards, sprinkled far out over thecountry. And now, at the point where the distant kopjes slope to theplain, the air grows heavy with dust-wreaths, rising like steam from acauldron, and underneath, slowly emerging, comes something dark andsolid. It is the head of the column. The great caterpillar is crawlingforward. You must push on--"Stand to your horses!"LETTER XXPRINSLOO'S SURRENDER--ICAMP, NEAR FOURIESBERG, _July 26_, 1900.We have a whole day of peace and rest before us--very welcome after thehard fighting we have been doing lately. This lull is to allowBruce-Hamilton and Macdonald to stop the exits at the eastern end of thevalley. We don't want to push the enemy east till we are sure the passesin that direction have been secured. Some of us are annoyed at thedelay. We were in touch with the enemy this morning, our scouts andadvance guard exchanging shots with their rearguard. We could see themprancing about on the bare hills east of Fouriesberg, and making off ina leisurely way up the eastern valley, and most of us were quiteexpecting that we should give chase immediately.Hunter rode forward to have a look. He watched the tiny horsemenhovering on the hills or cantering away; then back he came with a quietsmile on his face, and instead of ordering the advance, as the impetuousones expected, he led his column back over the way we had come forseveral miles, and then camped.So here we are, sitting or lying about, sleeping, smoking, or reading.Our camp is in a small plain, five or six miles from Fouriesberg,surrounded by ranges of great hills. Those south and east, their gauntpeaks rising, streaked with white, above the lower and nearer ones, arein Basutoland. They play an important part in our programme, for it isagainst that huge barrier that we are pressing the Boers. There are somerounded, turf-clad hills, but most are rocky. Sharp points and stonyridges rise up with jagged and clear-cut outlines into the sky, withgorges and valleys retreating in between, full of deep blue shade, andoften horizontal bands of strata, showing like regularly built coursesof white masonry along the flanks of the mountains. It is very fine,though gaunt, bare, and untenanted. We have had nothing but level veldtto march on for weeks past, and the change to the eye is a pleasant one.Nevertheless, it is a bad country for our business. To us mountainranges are not fine scenery, but strong positions; and rocks and cragsare not grand and picturesque, but merely good cover. We always serveout extra-ammunition when we come to a pretty bit of scenery.The present position is this: We have got the Boers, a big lot of them,at any rate, into a very broken and mountainous country, a countrywhich, though it suits their tactics and is strong for defence, isnevertheless very difficult to get out of. The way south is barred bythe Basutoland border. They dare not cross that or they would have thehordes of Basutos, who are already buzzing and humming like ahalf-roused hive, on to them. The other passes Hunter occupies in thisway: Rundle comes up from the south-west to Fouriesberg through CommandoNek. Paget and Clements march south towards the same point throughSlabbert's Nek. A little farther east Hunter himself forces RetiefsNek, while farther east still Bruce-Hamilton, helped by Macdonald, is tohold Naawpoort Nek and block the Golden Gate road. The western columns,_i.e._ Rundle's, Clement's, Paget's, and Hunter's, are to force asimultaneous entrance into the Fouriesberg valley, and having got theenemy's force jammed against the Basuto border, to force it to turneastward up the rugged Caledon valley, the only two exits to which are,we hope, by this time held by Bruce-Hamilton and Macdonald. This we havenow done. Now it only remains to see whether these eastern exits havebeen successfully occupied by our columns or not.[Illustration: PLAN TO ILLUSTRATE PRINSLOO'S SURRENDER]From the moment of leaving Bethlehem, at which place we remained nearlya fortnight while the General placed his columns, we entered among thehills and fighting was continuous. Our passage to force was Relief'sNek, and, as we had expected, the Boers made a determined stand there.The ground lay in a naturally defensive position; a narrow plain amongsteep, almost precipitous, ranges, and in the plain, arresting furtherprogress, an abruptly sunken valley, scooped out to a depth of a coupleof hundred feet; as though, what must perhaps have happened, some suddencollapse down below had allowed the ground here to fall in. The sidesare in most places precipitous, but to the north they shelve up bydegrees in terraces of sloping rock which a man can easily clamber up.The first terrace is only a few feet deep, and accordingly a number ofmen can form here along the brink and fire across the plain, beingtotally concealed from the advancing troops. Moreover, the edge of thiscurious and sudden valley is indented and pierced with a number oflittle crevices and fissures in which riflemen can snugly ensconcethemselves with little risk of being seen by attackers in front. Thiswas the main Boer position. You see it departed from the general rule,and instead of occupying a hill, occupied a hollow. They arepast-masters in the art of choosing ground. The adjacent heights werealso held.On the morning of the 23rd we struck our camp a few miles north of theNek, and advanced to find out whether the enemy were in position here ornot. We started before daylight. The night had been intensely cold andvery wet. On the high mountains snow had fallen. The sky was heavilyclouded, and about sunrise-time dense masses of mist rose and clungabout the hills, sometimes closing in the view at fifty yards and thendrifting off and leaving it clear again. Our scouts advanced steadily,reconnoitring hill after hill and ridge after ridge, but still there wasno sound of firing, and we began to think that the enemy had abandonedthe place altogether. This preliminary scouting work, poking about inthe hills with a handful of men to find the enemy, always reminds me oftufting for deer in the Exmoor woods before the pack is laid on.Then there came a few shots from our extreme right, from the hills onthe right of the valley's nose, sounding very muffled and dull in themist, and we, out on the left, advanced with the more caution. It was mychance to come upon the enemy first on this side, and as it will giveyou a fair notion of the usual risks of scouting, I will tell you how ithappened!I was out with my tufters on the left front, and we were drawing withall possible care the hills on that side. In front of us was a tallpeak, and I sent a few men to work round it on the left while I wentround the right. This hill really overlooked the Boer position. My leftflankers got round and rejoined me in front. Either they must have beenconcealed from the Boers by the mist or have been mistaken for a partyof Boers themselves, for they had passed within a few hundred yards ofthe edge where the enemy lay and were not fired at.Damant, our captain, coolest and bravest of officers, now joined me, andwith two or three men we pushed cautiously on towards some loose rocks,which, from the top of the rise, seemed to command a view of the valleybeneath. We had advanced to within eighty yards of the rocks, in openorder, when we thought we heard voices talking, and immediatelyafterwards some one said loudly in Dutch, "Who rides there?" And thenanother voice more to the right exclaimed, "Here they are!" At the sameinstant one caught a motion as of heads and shoulders cuddling down andadjusting themselves in a disagreeable way. There they were and nomistake, all tucked in among the rocks like wood-lice.Our position then was a curious one, for we had actually walked quite inthe open up to within speaking distance of the main Boer position, aposition that was to defy our army for a day and a half.The ground sloped down in a slight hollow. It was thickly sprinkled withsnow and dotted here and there with little green spots where the grasstufts showed through. A wire fence crossed the hollow lower down.Luckily we heard their voices before they started shooting, andinstantly we turned and rode for it, the Mausers all openingimmediately and the bullets cracking and whistling round our ears. Asbad luck would have it, my pony, which, like most of them, knows anddreads the sound of rifles fired at him (though he will stand close to abattery or among men firing without minding it in the least), became sofrantic at the noise of the bullets that I was quite unable to steerhim. With head wrenched round he bored away straight down the hilltowards the wire. As we got to it I managed to lift him half round andwe struck it sideways. The shock flung me forward on to his neck, whichI clasped with my left arm and just saved myself falling. For an instantor two he struggled in the wire, a mark for every rifle, and then gotclear. In his efforts he had got half through his girths and the saddlewas back on his rump. A pretty spectacle we must have looked, I sittingback on his tail, my hat in my hand, both stirrups dangling, and thebullets whistling round both of us like hailstones. However, I luggedhim out at last, and we went up the side of the fence broadside on tothe shooters, as hard as ever we could lay legs to the ground. It is adifficult thing to bring off a crossing shot at that pace, and in a fewhundred yards we were over the slope and out of shot. I have seen lotsof our men have much narrower escapes than this.Well, after all that, we will get back to the action. Having located theenemy, the Guides all collected behind the conical hill, climbed up, andfrom the edges of it began shooting down into the Boer position. Here wewere joined by the Black Watch, who carried on the same game. It wasnot, however, at all a paying game, and the fact that the Boers had notheld this hill themselves, though so close to their position, issufficient of itself to show their remarkable skill in choice of ground.For the hill, conical and regular in shape, was perfectly bare, andwhile they behind the sharp ledges and in the fissures of the rocksbelow were well concealed from the men above, these as they crept roundthe smooth hillside came into immediate view against the sky. The sleetof bullets shaving the hill edge was like the wind whistling past. TheBlack Watch lost a lot of men here. In the afternoon the Guides and someof Lovat's Scouts pushed forward on the left and gained a low ridge,where, lying down, we could command a part of the enemy's position, andsend in a flanking fire. This manoeuvre was useful and suggested a planfor next day. That night I had to take out a picket on a hill on oursouth-east front and had but a sorry time of it; for it was a bitterlycold, rather wet night, and the position was not without its anxiety. Igot little sleep.Next morning, July 24, soon after light, the main body of the Guides andLovat's Scouts (who are under Rimington at present) came out, and werode down to the slopes on the left of the Boer valley again. Here wecrept up as far as we could and began to put in our fire. It must havebeen very annoying for them, for a part of their position was quiteexposed to us. We could see the short white cliff at the edge of thebasin and the Boers moving about and running up and down, diving intofissures and getting under cover, for all the world like rabbits, as ourfire searched the position. They replied, but though a lot of bulletswere whistling about, no one was hit. There was a Maxim at the foot ofthe conical hill rattling away, and the Black Watch were again on thehill itself, blazing away at the rocks as vigorously as ever. Then atlast between us and them up gallops a section of guns, and the littlepuff balls begin to burst along the rock edge in a way which we couldsee was very disconcerting for the Boers, who were rapidly finding theplace too hot for them. A little after, some one sings out, "Here comesthe attack!" and true enough we can make out the little khaki dots inlong loose strings moving forward round the hill towards the valleyhead. It is the Seaforths. We on our side "carry on the motion," dashforward, lie down and shoot, and on again. We make for a kopje on ouredge of the valley. The fire is too hot for the Boers to dare to show upmuch and there is not much opposition. But I can assure you that acharge of 1500 yards, even without the enemy's fire, is a serious thingenough. Puffing and panting, I struggle on. Long-legged Colonials gostriding by land leave me gasping in the rear. When at last we reach thekopje and look down into the sunken valley, the Seaforths are pouring intheir fire on the retreating Boers, our fellows are doing the same fromthe kopje top, but I myself am too pumped out to care for anything andcan only lie on the ground and gasp.I see in your last letter you want to know about the character of theGuides, and whether there has been any cases of treachery among them. Idon't know what started these old yarns. They were invented aboutMagersfontein time, probably to account for that awful mishap, and gotinto the local press here and made a lot of fuss, but we have heardnothing since on that score. There is such a lot of treachery put here(owing to the intermingling of English and Dutch in their twoterritories) that almost anything in that line seems credible, and thereare numbers of people about, loafers in bars and fifth-rateboarding-houses, to whom anything base seems perfectly natural, and whodelight in starting and circulating such tales. At the same time thereare also numbers of honest and loyal men, and it is from these, andexclusively from these, that the fighters are drawn. In South Africa,and among the South Africans, a war of this sort, between neighbours andcousins, is the sternest test of loyalty. Many have failed to stand it.But the loyalty of those who have not wavered, but have taken up armsfor their country in a quarrel like this, is of a sort you can trust tothe utmost extremity. There are no men in the field who feel so deep ananimosity towards the Boers, and whom the Boers in their turn hate somuch, as the fighting South African Colonials. As for the Guides, I canassure you that there has not been a single case of any one of our menhaving been accused of treachery, nor suspected of treachery. I havemade careful inquiries, lest such a case might have occurred without myknowledge, and I am assured by our adjutant (C.H. Rankin, Captain 7thHussars) that there has been no such case, and that the slander waswithout the slightest foundation whatever.Shortly after Magersfontein the greater part of the Guides turned backto Colesberg, leaving fifteen of us with Methuen, the services of thewhole corps not being required, as Methuen's force was now stationary.Before it left, Methuen paraded the corps and spoke in the warmest termsof the good work it had done. Nevertheless it was their turning back, orbeing _sent back_, as it was called, that gave a pretext to the slanderthat was then started. Later, when his attention was called to thestory, Methuen wrote to the _Cape Times_ a most emphatic lettervindicating the corps from the least suspicion, and indignantly denyingthat the least cause for any had existed. Lord Roberts himself, who cameup soon afterwards, wrote a very handsome and decisive letter to thesame paper, and since then I don't think we have heard anything aboutit. The whole story is so ridiculous, considering the way the Guideshate the Boers, and the danger of the services they do, that to any onewho knows anything about the corps it is a tale rather to be laughed, atthan seriously resented. I saw the other day a letter from Hunter toRimington, in which the General speaks of the corps with a kind ofweighty deliberation that is very satisfactory, mentioning emphaticallyits "trustworthiness," its "bravery," and its "exceptional and provedvalue in the field."Our casualty list so far is about forty per cent., I believe; but thisloss, though not light, does not in a Colonial corps give an adequateidea of the service done. All the Colonials, so far as I know (theAustralians and South Africans certainly), have much the same qualitiesthat make our enemies so formidable. They have individual intelligenceand skill, a faculty for observation, and the habit of thinking forthemselves. They are therefore able to take care of themselves in a waywhich our regular troops, mostly town-bred men, without independenttraining, cannot do.The difference comes out chiefly in scouting, including all the flankingand advance guard business, extending for several miles to left andright, and in front and rear of an army column, by which that columnfeels its way through an enemy's country. The regulars usually carry outthese tactics in long lines with wide intervals between the men. Butnothing is so conspicuous as a long line of men riding at fifty yards'interval. They can be detected a dozen miles off, and plenty ofopportunities will occur for a mobile, cunning enemy like the Boers tolie in ambush and get a shot at the outsider. Our regulars are better atthis game than they used to be, but many lives have been lost at it. Onthe other hand, Colonials adopt more the tactics of a Scotch gillie in adeer forest, whose object is to see, but not to be seen. Sky-lines areavoided and cover taken every advantage of. From places where a goodview is to be obtained the country is intently studied; not by ahorseman poised in relief like the Achilles statue in Hyde Park, but bya man who has left his horse on the reverse slope and lies hidden amongthe rocks with his glass. Again, if a farm or suspicious-looking kopjehas to be approached, this is partly encircled, and threatened orexamined in flank or rear before being occupied; while if the place, along range of hills for instance, has to be approached in front, asudden left or right wheel at long range may often draw the enemy'sfire. These are a few of the many expedients that sometimes suggestthemselves to lessen risk. In all, the first necessity is personalintelligence in the men and the habit of taking notice and thinking forthemselves, faculties which the independent, self-reliant life of theColonials has greatly developed. Just the same holds good when it comesto shooting; choosing cover, keeping oneself hidden, creeping on frompoint to point without giving the enemy a fair shot, or detecting theprobable bushes or rocks behind which an enemy may be lying, or any signof his whereabouts. The Tommy as he advances is apt to expose himself,because he doesn't think. The Colonial will get to the same spot perhapsquite unperceived. This is why I say that our loss does not give anadequate idea of the work done by the corps. The defence of the conicalhill here at Relief's Nek is a good example. Our men hold the hill forseveral hours before the regulars come up, and lose one man. As soon asthe regulars arrive (though by this time the exposed places are knownand the enemy located), they begin to lose men, and by the conclusion ofthe action have lost, I am told, over forty. I think, and have oftenspoken so highly of our soldiers' courage, that I don't hesitate topoint out their weakness. They are lacking in personal intelligence.For all their pluck, they don't know how to look after themselves. Therehave been, as you will have heard, many cases in which detached partiesof our cavalry, mounted infantry, and yeomanry have been cut off andcaptured. How often has this happened to the Colonials?LETTER XXIPRINSLOO'S SURRENDER--II_August 4th_.We have been up the valley and back again, and I write this once morefrom Fouriesberg. We passed through here, joining Rundle, as I told youa week ago, and pushed on eastward in the direction of Naawpoort Nek andthe Golden Gate. Six miles out from here, passing through a very ruggedcountry, we came on their outposts. These we shelled and drove back.They then retired to some hills not very high, but with perpendicularsides of low white cliffs commanding the approach across the plain.These they held till nightfall. We shelled them a good deal and knockedout the only gun they had, and the infantry pushed forward in front andwe took a hill on the right, but the attack was not pressed home, as itwould have cost too many lives. The infantry took the hill during thenight, but found it evacuated, the Boers having retired as soon as itgot dark.We did not know all this time how things had gone with Macdonald andBruce-Hamilton, and whether or not they had been able to block theeastern exits. On this everything depended. So it was with a feeling ofthe most gleeful satisfaction that we heard next morning, havingfollowed the Boers up some two or three miles without seeing anythingof them, the deep, heavy baying of a big gun in the distance, which weall recognised as the voice of one of the 5-inch cow-guns that had gonewith Bruce-Hamilton. It fired a few shots and then ceased. With infinitetoil, forty oxen to each gun, we then dragged our own two 5-inchers upthe hill we were on, and got them into position for shelling the defilesahead. They were not, however, needed. Messengers now began to arrivefrom the Boer laagers carrying white flags. There was a lot of palaver.These went, others came. Le Gallais, our chief of the staff, interviewedthem, while Hunter strolled a little way apart, dreamily admiring theview. It was evident the Boer envoys were sticking out for terms whichthey couldn't get. I could see Le Gallais indicate the surroundings withsummary gestures. The Boers looked very glum. They eyed the cow-gunsespecially with profound disgust. These were looking particularlyridiculous. The nose of one of them projected in the direction of thosesecret Boer-tenanted defiles as if the great creature were sniffing forits enemies in the distance; which gave it a very truculent andthreatening air, as who should say, "Come now, Le Gallais, old fellow,suppose you let me put a word in," while the other, hanging its headtill its nose touched the very ground, seemed overcome, poor wretch,with a sudden fit of bashfulness, most absurd in so huge and warlike amonster. The Boers looked from them to Le Gallais and from Le Gallais tothem, but there was no more hope from one than the other, and at lastthey realised that there was nothing for it but to surrender, andsurrender was agreed to. We could scarcely believe our good fortune. AtPaardeberg we caught 4000, but we used 50,000, more or less, to do it,and we lost about 1500 doing it. Here we trapped as many or more,composed of some of the best commandoes of the Free State, caught them,too, in a wild mountainous country such as you would think was almostimpregnable. We used 15,000 to do it, and we lost, I suppose, not 200altogether. Also, we have taken enormous quantities of horses, oxen, andwaggons, which will come in very useful.It seems to me that Hunter deserves the utmost credit that can be givento him. We have had plenty of generals who have done direct fighting anddone it well; but, with the doubtful exception of Paardeberg, we havehad no triumph of tactics. We have never scored off the Boers, nevermade a big capture, or cut them up, or taken guns or transport, orbested them in any decisive way by superior strategy till now. This hasalways been our lament. We have always said, "Why, with all these armiesin the field, cannot we surround them, or catch them, or deal a decisiveblow of some sort?" But hitherto we have never succeeded in bringing offsuch a coup. We have pushed them before us, losing as many or more thanthey at every shift, but, whenever we have thought to get a hold ofthem, they have always eluded us. You may think it is a strange thingthat they have been caught this time. The daring of Hunter's plan andthe rapidity it was carried out with made it succeed. The Boers--so theytell me at least--never believed that we should venture with so small aforce to penetrate by four or five different routes into such a strongcountry. The scheme seemed to lay us open to a disaster if the enemy hadrapidly concentrated and flung itself on one of the separated forces.This danger, however, was more apparent than real, because the groundmanoeuvred over was not altogether of very large extent, so that reliefmight be sent from one column to another, or the enemy, if concentratedagainst one column, rapidly followed up by one or more of the others.Besides which, if the country offered strong positions to take, itoffered strong ones to hold, and in a very short time any threatenedcolumn could have placed itself in such a position as to make itimpossible for the Boers to shift it in the time at their disposal.Still the plan, considering the Boers' skill in defending strongpositions, had an audacious look about it. Several of the Boer prisonershave since told me--I don't know with what truth--that they thought weshould follow them in by the Relief Nek pass, and that it was theirintention to work round and threaten our communications, and either cutus off or force us to fight our way out as best we could.The quickness of our advance, too, was of the utmost importance. Fromthe moment we started, the enemy was given no opportunity to pullhimself together and look about him. Hunter, Paget, Clements, and Rundledashed into the Fouriesberg Valley exactly together. Directly we had gotthrough, Hunter detached the main part of his column, the HighlandBrigade, under Macdonald, and sent it with several guns as hard as itcould pelt to back up Bruce-Hamilton, knowing, now that we had carriedour end of the valley, that the pressure would come at the east end.Meantime, while Macdonald marched, we waited. We even retreated two orthree miles, and for twenty-four hours lay on the pass and slept. Thenwe got up and began sauntering up the big irregular valley along theBasutoland border towards Naawpoort Nek.It was a moment of infinite expectation. Bets were laid on the amount ofour bag. The general impression was that we should get some of them, butthat the main body would, somehow or other, escape. We had so oftentoiled and taken nothing, that this sudden miraculous draught quiteflabbergasted us. And what must have been the feelings of the poorBoers? They tried Naawpoort Nek: no exit. They knocked at the GoldenGate: it was locked. Then back they turned and met Hunter sauntering upthe valley, and we gave them the time of day with our cow-guns, and toldthem how glad we were to see them. "Fancy meeting you, of all people inthe world!" And so they chucked it. It was a complete checkmate.The surrender occupied the next three days; our total bag 4100, I amtold. I wish you could have been there. It was a memorable sight amongthose uninhabited and lonely mountains. The heights of Basutoland, ridgebehind ridge, to right of us; the tops snow streaked; groups of excitedBasutos riding about in the plains, watching our movements; to left thegreat mountain chain we had fought our way through; and in the midstspread over the wide saddle-backed hill, that slopes awaynorth-eastward, and breaks up in a throng of sharp peaks and a jumbleof inaccessible-looking hills in the direction of the Golden Gate, isdrawn up the dirty, ragged, healthy, sun-scorched British army withgreasy rifles in its blackened hands, watching imperturbably and withoutmuch interest, the parties of Boers, and waggons, and droves of cattleas they come meandering in. Each Boer, as he rides up, hands over hisrifle, or more often flings it angrily on the ground, and the armourersset to work, smashing them all across an anvil. Rather a waste of goodweapons it seemed, I must say. Many of the Boers were quite boys, aboutfourteen or fifteen. They are much better looking than you would thinkfrom the men. The men are big and well built, but they look, for themost part, stupid and loutish, and when this is not so, their expressionis more often cunning than intelligent. The amount of hair about theirface, too, and their indifference to washing, does not improve theirappearance. However, in the boy stage, and before the dulness of theirsurrounding has had time to tell, they are quite different, frank-facedand manly, with clear skin, tall and well grown, like young larches. Itdoes seem strange that such mere children should be in the field againstus. What would you think of giving Puckie a rifle and sending him out tofight? Boer prisoners have told me that the courage of these boys couldbe relied on; they were often braver, and would stick to a position theyhad been placed in longer than the men. They showed traces of theexperience they had been through, though. Not only in being deeplytanned and more or less ragged and thin, but by an unmistakableexpression (in many instances) in their faces and in their eyes; adilated look, as of one who sees something appalling before him, andbraces himself to face it out. Considering what it is to be exposed tolyddite and shrapnel fire (the absolute hell of din and concussionbesides rain of bullets), one doesn't wonder that it leaves marks onyoung faces.R. and I rode eastward through the hills in the Golden Gate direction,meeting parties of Boers, waggons, Cape-carts, &c., coming stragglingin. It reminded me of the road to Epsom on a Derby morning. There issome pleasure in meeting Boers on these terms. "Good morning. How areyou? A pleasant morning for a ride, is it not?" "Good morning, sir; itis fine now, but I think we shall have rain later." That's what I like.There's nothing like a little urbanity.Towards the end of a long valley we come to some signs of defensive workthat interest us. The Boers evidently expected to be able to await ouradvance here before they found their retreat was cut off. They havethrown up some shelters. We noticed from afar off several veryconspicuous stone sangars, but coming close, we were surprised to findthat they were made of stones loosely put together with big chinks, veryflimsy and frail, and much too high for their purpose, too. Theyevidently were not intended for shelters at all. What were they therefor? We looked carefully round, and at last the meaning of the devicestruck us. A hundred yards to the right the ground dropped sharp,leaving an edge; here was the real position and the natural cover. Wewalked over, and found the usual little hollows and inconspicuousstones arranged. Here was where their riflemen had lain, with a viewright up the valley. And the meaning of those conspicuous edifices wasnow plain. Stuck up on the bare brow, plain to be seen at 2000 yards,they were simply meant to draw our fire. The smokeless Mausers wouldhave told no tales, and I have no doubt that, if the attack had comeoff, the device would have more or less succeeded, for the stoneshelters, though obviously dummies on close inspection, looked all rightat a distance. Besides, a definite mark always attracts fire. It wascharacteristic of Boer cuteness.LETTER XXIIFIGHTING AND TREKKINGHEILBRON, _August 17_.We stayed several days among the mountains on the scene of thesurrender, collecting our prisoners and the waggons, guns, horses, &c.,and sending them off to the railway. The valley, viewed from the hillwhere we were camped, looked much like one of our West Country horsefairs on a very large scale. The separate commandoes were herdedtogether in big groups of several hundred men, sitting and lying aboutand talking. The ox-waggons and battered Cape-carts were drawn uptogether in a great array; but the busiest part of it all was thedivision of the horses into mobs fit or unfit for remounts, and thedistribution of them to the various regiments. Rimington superintendedthis job. Of course, after all our marching, we were sadly in want ofremounts. The Boers had any number of horses, many of them bringing intwo or three apiece, and the majority were in good condition and fit forwork, probably owing to the fact that the grazing all about this side ofthe Free State, especially among these mountains, is excellent. TheSouth African ponies, I may tell you, are the only satisfactory mountsfor South Africa. We have tried horses from all parts of the world now,and they can none of them stand the climate, work, and food like thenative breeds. The South African pony, wretched little brute as helooks, will tripple and amble on, week after week and month after month,with a heavy man on his back, and nothing to eat but the pickings ofsour, dried-up veldt grass and an occasional handful of Indian corn; andthough you will eye him with an eye of scorn, no doubt (if he shouldhappen to be allotted to your use), and envy some other man his fatBurmese or Argentine, yet by-and-by you will find out your mistake; forthe fat Burmese and the Argentine, and all the other imported breeds,will gradually languish and fade away, and droop and die, worn down bythe unremitting work and the bad, insufficient food; but your raggedlittle South African will still amble on, still hump himself for hissaddle in the morning, and still, whenever you dismount, poke about forroots and fibres of withered grass as tough as himself, or make anoccasional hearty meal off the straw coverings of a case of whiskybottles. With an action that gives the least possible exertion; with thedigestion of an ostrich, and the eye of a pariah dog for any straymorsel of food; with an extraordinary capacity for taking rest insnatches, and recouping himself by a roll whenever you take his saddleoff; and of course, from the natural toughness of his constitution, too,he is able to stand the long and gradual strain of being many hoursunder the saddle every day (and perhaps part of the night, too) in a waythat unaccustomed horses cannot do. By this time we all know hismerits, and there is immense demand from every mounted corps for theBoer ponies. The Major is up to his eyes in work, as officers andorderlies come galloping up with requisitions from the variousregiments. He has the born horse lover's dislike for parting with areally good horse except to a man he knows something about. Loud anduproarious is the chaff and protestations (now dropping to confidentialmutterings) as the herds of horses are broken up and the various lotsassigned. As I say, it looks from the hilltop exactly like a westcountry fair on an enlarged scale, and the great lonely Basutomountains, too, might seem a larger edition of the Exmoor hills aroundWinsford. The Boer prisoners, poor fellows, have no eye for thepicturesque. They congregate together and grumble and watch thedistribution of their horses with a very sour expression.From this point we sent our prisoners in, _via_ Winberg, to the railway,the Major and most of the corps going with them as part of the escort;while I with twenty men, consisting partly of Guides and partly ofLovat's Scouts, was detached to continue as bodyguard to Hunter. He,with the main column (we reunited at Bethlehem), marched to Lindley andthen here to Heilbron.It was ten miles south of this that we came in contact with Olivier.Olivier and De Wet had both broken through our cordon at different timesand escaped from the hills. Sent one morning with a message to theSussex outside Slabbert's Nek I saw shells bursting, and all theappearance of a heavy fight going on over the hills to the north-west.This was Christian De Wet, who with several guns and about 1500well-mounted men, had made a dash for freedom when he found the placewas getting too hot, and had been promptly tackled by Broadwood when hegot outside. Pursuer and pursued vanished into the blue distance of theveldt, battering each other as they went, like birds that fight and flyat the same time. Broadwood, however, had got hold of his enemy by thewrong end. What happened exactly we don't know, but De Wet got clearsomehow, and immediately turned his attention to his beloved railwayline, which he never can tear himself away from for more than a few daysat a time. He is now, I should imagine, in the very seventh heaven ofdelight, having torn up miles of it, besides capturing several trains.De Wet is getting an immense reputation. The rapidity of his movementsis extraordinary. He always has two or three of our columns after him;sometimes half-a-dozen. Among these he wings his way like a fowl of somedifferent breed, a hawk among owls. Some amusement was caused by thereport in orders the other day that De Wet had marched north pursued "byvarious generals;" as if two or three, more or less, didn't matter, asindeed it didn't. Of course, mere fast marching would not alwaysextricate him, but he shows such marvellous coolness and common sense inthe way in which he doubles. Several times he has been reportedsurrounded; but each time when we came to look he had disappeared. It islike a conjuring trick. He seems to have an intuitive knowledge of theplans of our generals, and to divine how any movements of his willmodify theirs. He makes a swift march. This he knows will set in motiona certain column. Night comes and back he steals, and dashes out throughthe gap left without any one being the wiser. He never loses hissangfroid, but acts always, in the most hopeless positions, with equalcraft and rapidity. In short, like the prophet Isaiah, he is "_capablede tout_." For he can hit hard, too. I think since the arrival of themain army he is the only man who has scored off us at all freely.Sanna's Post and Reddersberg came first; then, last May, came thecapture of the 500 Yeomanry at Lindley; that was followed immediately bythe surprise of the Heilbron convoy and all its escort; then came thecapture of the Derbyshire Militia, and a few days later the taking ofRoodeval with a train of mails and various details. Even when he hadbolted out the other day between our legs, and was flying north with twoor three cavalry brigades after him, he found time to snap up a hundredWelsh Fusiliers and break the line as he passed. He is, they say,extremely amusing, and keeps his men always in a good temper with hisjests; the other day, after one of his many train captures, he sent amessage to the base to say that "he was sufficiently supplied withstores now, and would they kindly send up some remounts." He is now theonly prize left worth taking, and every one is desperately keen in hispursuit. I notice, however, that people never seem to meet him when theywant to, though when they don't want to, they very often do.Olivier, with a force about equal to De Wet, also broke out from thehills, and having reached the open country, hung about to watch ourmovements. There are some kopjes ten miles south of Heilbron, verynicely arranged, with a back hill commanding a front one, so that thefirst position gained would only bring us under the fire of the second;a very favourite Boer trick. Here Olivier awaited our coming, and,knowing the range to an inch, landed his first shell plump in the middleof our convoy. Hunter, and we with him (it is certainly great fun beingwith the Staff for the time being), were at the head of the column, andheard the shell go over. Never have I seen a better shot. It exploded onthe track, right underneath a great waggon, to the amazement andconsternation of the Kaffir drivers and the wretched oxen; though theywere all, I believe, a good deal more frightened than hurt. Three orfour more quickly followed. "Roll that up," said Le Gallais to the Guidecarrying the General's flag. A few minutes passed, during which we wereshot at without being able to reply. Then two Field Batteries camegalloping to the front. Guns! Guns! Way for the guns! like thefire-engines down Piccadilly they came tearing along. As the iron wheelsstrike upon rocks the guns leap and swing. Stones and splinters flyright and left, and the dust flung up by wheel and hoof boils alongtheir course. Nothing is more stirring than to see guns coming fullspeed into action. In another minute they have lined up on the ridge andtheir shells are bursting on the enemy's hill.Hector Macdonald is a man who always amuses me. Ordinarily he is asomewhat grim-looking individual; but when there is any fighting goingon his whole manner changes, and he beams and mantles with a sort ofsuppressed mirth. He comes swaggering up now as the guns are opening,looking like a man who has just been told the best story he ever heardin his life, and is still chuckling over it. "They're on to us again,"he bubbles out, knocking his boot with his whip in irrepressible glee."What! what! they're on to us again." He looks round at us and grins,and seems to lick his lips as a shell goes howling overhead and burstsbehind us. His merits as a general are very much discussed, but there isone thing he does thoroughly enjoy, more than any man I know, and thatis being shot at. I suppose he would rather win a battle than lose one,but I am sure he would rather lose one than not fight at all.Next to him, in marked contrast to his excitement, stands out the coolattentive face of "Archie" Hunter; the most popular officer, as Ibelieve one might call him, of all the British army. He is noted chieflyas a fighter and for his dash and gallantry. He did all the fighting inthe Egyptian campaign. During the siege of Ladysmith it was he whoplanned and led the night attack which blew up the big Boer gun. When Iwas coming out on the steamer the one question asked among the warcorrespondents, who wanted to be where the most fighting was going on,was "Where will Hunter be?" But it is probably his kindness and the deepinterest he feels in all his men that makes him so universally popular.Here is a tiny instance, perhaps not worth mentioning. We were halted onthe march for a moment, sitting about and smoking, when the General gavethe word to mount, and one of the orderlies, a trooper of the Lancers,jumped up in a hurry and left his pipe behind him. Hunter saw thefilthy, precious object lying on the ground, and put it in his ownpocket. At the next halt he went up to the trooper, and with that mannerof his of deliberate kindness, returned it to him. A mere nothing, ofcourse, but very characteristic.He has a way of looking at you, no matter who you are, Tommy or officeror what not, with a wonderfully kind expression, as if he felt the mostfriendly interest in you. And so he does; it is not a bit put on. Hedoes not seem to think about himself, but about the people and thingsround him. Every morning he finds time to stop and ask after the horsesand men of our little body, and to exchange a word with one or two ofthe men whom he has had occasion to notice. Not a grain of condescensionis there in him; not even a thought that he is giving them pleasure. Itis a natural impulse with him, the result of the real regard andinterest he feels in every soldier that marches under him. In action hismanner, always calm, is just as calm as at any other time. He sayslittle; observing the most important developments or listening to thereports of orderlies from various parts of the field, more often thannot without any comment at all. Yet nothing escapes him.Our action with Olivier is a rather stupid one, and I shall not attemptto describe it. We take the first position, losing from forty to fiftymen, only to find that the enemy have retired to the second range, andthat it is too late to follow them up. Probably the only man at allsatisfied with the day's performance is old Mac.Through a weary land we have come marching north these ten days. Theveldt is at its worst, parched and dry and dead. Our column trekkingraises a huge cloud of reddish dust that hangs still in the air, andmarks for miles back the way we have come. The whole expanse is quitecolourless--almost white, or a dirty grey. All day long the blue sky isunvaried, and the sun glares down unobscured by a cloud; sky and earthemphasising each other's dull monotony. Only at sunrise and late eveningsome richer and purer lines of colour lie across the distant plain, andthe air is fresh and keen. Round about the town, which, like all theseBoer towns, stuck down in the middle of the veldt, reminds one of somemoonstruck flotilla becalmed on a distant sea, the grass is all worn andeaten to the very dust. Whiffs of horrid smell from dead carcases ofhorses and cattle taint the air. All the water consists of a feeblestream, stagnant now and reduced to a line of muddy pools, some reservedfor horses, some for washing, and some for drinking, but all of the samemud colour.And yet even for this country, I think it with a kind of dull surpriseas I look out over the naked hideousness of the land, men can be foundto fight. What is it to be a child of the veldt, and never to have knownany other life except the life of these plains? It is to reproduce inyour own nature the main features of this extraordinary scenery. Here isa life of absolute monotony, a landscape, huge, and on a grand scale,but dull and unvaried, and quite destitute of any kind of interest, ofany noteworthy detail, of any feature that excites attention and remark.And the people, its children, are like unto it. Their minds are asblank, as totally devoid of culture and of ideas as the plains aroundthem. They have an infinite capacity for existing without doing anythingor thinking anything; in a state of physical and mental inertia thatwould drive an Englishman mad. A Boer farmer, sitting on his stoep,large and strong, but absolutely lethargic, is the very incarnation ofthe spirit of the veldt. At the same time, when one remembers theclatter and gabble of our civilisation, it is impossible to deny him acertain dignity, though it may be only the dignity of cattle.The problem will apparently be, when we have burnt these people out orshot them, and in various ways annexed a good deal of the land they nowlive on, how are we to replace them? What strikes one is that time andthe country, acting on the naturally phlegmatic Dutch character, hasproduced a type exactly suited to this life and these surroundings. Andit does seem in many ways a pity to destroy this type unless you havesomething to take its place. Except in one or two very limited areas,accessible to markets, and where there is a water supply, no Englishcolonist would care to settle in this country. The Canadians andAustralians, many of whom volunteered, and came here with the view ofhaving a look at the land and perhaps settling, are, I hear, unanimousin condemning it. Indeed, it does not require any great knowledge ofagriculture to see that a country like this, a lofty table-land, dry andbarren, with no market handy, or chance of irrigation, is a wretchedpoor farming country. Hence the pity it seems of wiping out theburghers. They may not be a very lofty type of humanity, but they hadthe advantage in nature's scheme of filling a niche which no one else,when they are turned out, will care to fill in their place. The olddead-alive farm, the sunny stoep, the few flocks and herds and wanderinghorses sparsely scattered over the barren plain, the huge ox-waggon,most characteristic and intimate of their possessions, part tent andpart conveyance, formed for the slow but sure navigation of thesesolitudes, and reminding one a great deal of the rough but seaworthysmacks and luggers of our coasts, that somehow seem in their rudenessand efficiency to stand for the very character of a whole life, allthese things are no doubt infinitely dear to the Boer farmer, and makeup for him the only life possible, but I don't think it would be apossible life for any one else. It seems inevitable that large numbersof farms, owing to death of owners, war indemnity claims, bankruptcy,and utter ruin of present holders, &c., will fall into the hands of ourGovernment when the war is over, and these will be especially the poorerfarms. But yet probably as years pass they will tend to lapse once moreinto Dutch hands, for it is difficult to believe that men of our racewill ever submit to such a life of absolute stagnation. In dealing withthe future of the country, it will always be a point that will have tobe borne in mind, that the natural conditions of life outside the townsare such as favour the Dutch character very much more than they do theEnglish.LETTER XXIIIWRITTEN FROM HOSPITALHOSPITAL, KRONSTADT, _September 6_, 1900.It is only a bad attack of influenza. I lie here in a dim, brown hollandcoloured twilight. A large marquee of double folded canvas keeps out thesun; a few shafts of light twinkle through here and there. Through threeentrance gaps I catch glimpses, crossed by a web of tent ropes, of othersurrounding tents, each neatly enclosed by a border of whitened stones,the purpose of which is to prevent people at night from tripping overthe ropes. Everything is scrupulously neat and clean. Orderlies run fromtent to tent minding their patients. Every now and then a pretty littlenursing sister, with white cuffs and scarlet pelisse, trips across theopen spaces between the straight lines of marquees, or stops to have amoment's chat and a little quiet bit of a flirt (they can always findtime for that, I notice) with one of the officers or doctors. I watchwith faint interest and a feeling of vague recollection. She looks upsideways and shades the sun off her eyes with her fingers. They keep itup still then!Some way off, among the Tommies' quarters, I can see groups of patientsin clean, dark-blue clothes walking about, or sitting on seats, takingthe air; some hobbling on crutches, some with arms in slings, headsbandaged, or patched and mended in some way or other. You feel like somedamaged implement tossed aside a moment for repair. "Mend me thislieutenant!" The doctors get to work, deft and quick; a littlestrengthening, repairing, polishing, and out you are shot again.It has been the only glimpse of absolute peace and rest I have had thiseleven months. Every one is kind and sympathetic; a cool breeze blowsthrough the looped-up tents; it is all very luxurious and pleasant forwearied-out soldiers. I like to lie and watch the little picturesthrough the tent openings of low blue veldt hills in the distance (whichsomehow remind one of the background glimpses in old Italian pictures),and dream over things one has seen and done, many of which seem alreadysuch ages ago, and listen to the bugle calls that sound at intervals inthe camp. I have managed to buy some pyjamas. Probably you would seesomething very ludicrous in the way in which, after an elaboratehot-bath and hair-cutting, dressed out in one's clean pyjamas and lyingbetween clean sheets, one rolls one's eyes with unutterable complacencyon one's surroundings. All our comforts are attended to. We have ashell-proof shelter in a ravine close by, handy in case of visits fromDe Wet; and the two great cow-guns, like guardian angels, doze on thetop of the hill behind the hospital. Under the shadow of their wing Ialways feel perfectly safe.From patients who come in daily from various parts of the country andvarious columns we get a general impression of how things are going.The army seems to be adopting very severe measures to try and end thecampaign out of hand, and the papers at home are loudly calling for suchmeasures, I see, and justifying them. Nevertheless, it is childish topretend that it is a crime in the Boers to continue fighting, or thatthey have done anything to disentitle them to the usages of civilisedwarfare. The various columns that are now marching about the country arecarrying on the work of destruction pretty indiscriminately, and we haveburnt and destroyed by now many scores of farms. Ruin, with greathardship and want, which may ultimately border on starvation, must bethe result to many families. These measures are not likely, I am afraid,to conduce much to the united South Africa we talk so much of andthought we were fighting for.I had to go myself the other day, at the General's bidding, to burn afarm near the line of march. We got to the place, and I gave theinmates, three women and some children, ten minutes to clear theirclothes and things out of the house, and my men then fetched bundles ofstraw and we proceeded to burn it down. The old grandmother was veryangry. She told me that, though I was making a fine blaze now, it wasnothing compared to the flames that I myself should be consumed inhereafter. Most of them, however, were too miserable to curse. The womencried and the children stood by holding on to them and looking withlarge frightened eyes at the burning house. They won't forget thatsight, I'll bet a sovereign, not even when they grow up. We rode awayand left them, a forlorn little group, standing among their householdgoods--beds, furniture, and gimcracks strewn about the veldt; thecrackling of the fire in their ears, and smoke and flame streamingoverhead. The worst moment is when you first come to the house. Thepeople thought we had called for refreshments, and one of the women wentto get milk. Then we had to tell them that we had come to burn the placedown. I simply didn't know which way to look. One of the women'shusbands had been killed at Magersfontein. There were others, men andboys, away fighting; whether dead or alive they did not know.I give you this as a sample of what is going on pretty generally. Ourtroops are everywhere at work burning and laying waste, and enormousreserves of famine and misery are being laid up for these countries inthe future.How far do you mean to go in this? Are you going to burn down everyhouse, and turn the whole country into a desert? I don't think it can bedone. You can't carry out the Cromwellian method in the nineteenthcentury. Too many people know what is going on, and consciences are tootender. On the other hand, nothing is so disastrous as that method halfcarried out. We can't exterminate the Dutch or seriously reduce theirnumbers. We can do enough to make hatred of England and thirst forrevenge the first duty of every Dutchman, and we can't effectivelyreduce the numbers of the men who will carry that duty out. Of course itis not a question of the war only. It is a question of governing thecountry afterwards.So far we only really hold the ground on which our armies stand. If Iwere to walk out from this tent a mile or two over the hills yonder, Ishould probably be shot. Kronstadt has been ours for four months. It ison the main railway. The country all round is being repeatedly crossedby our troops. Yet an Englishman would not be safe for a minute out ofrange of those guns on the hill.There is a delightful feeling of spring in the air. We have had somewarm, heavy rains lately. The veldt grass, till now dry and dusty andalmost white, is beginning to push up tiny green blades, and the greencolour is beginning to spread almost imperceptibly over the distanthills. I begin to feel a sort of kindred impulse in myself. The oldlethargy, bred of the dull, monotonous marches over the dreary plains,is passing, and I begin to cock an attentive eye at the signs ofawakening, and feel that I am waking up myself. If you could see theview from here, the barren expanse of veldt stretching miles away, thecluster of tin roofs and the few leafless thorn-trees beyond, I have nodoubt you would laugh at this fancy of a spring day. And yet I am sure Ican feel it; there is a change in the air. It has grown elastic andfeels alive, and there is a smell in it to my mind of earth andvegetables. Yesterday, when I toddled in as far as the village, I saw alittle fruit tree in a garden that carried white starry blossoms at theends of its black twigs. It gave me quite a thrill. Oh, to be in Englandnow that April--Dear me! I was forgetting 'tis autumn, and partridgesand stubble fields with you.The Hospital Commission of Inquiry has just turned up here, verydignified and grand in a train of half-a-dozen saloon carriages, whichmust be a great nuisance on the overworked lines. I have had severaltalks with the R.A.M.C. officers and men here about the alleged neglectand deficiencies, especially with the second in command, a very candid,liberal-minded man. He quite admits the shortcomings. The service isunder-manned. There are not enough medical officers and not enoughorderlies. This hospital, for instance, is entitled to a full coloneland two lieutenant-colonels, instead of which it has only onelieutenant-colonel, and the same proportion is preserved in the lowergrades. Men in all departments are stinted, and the hospitals are allseriously short-handed. They have done their best to make up thedeficiency with volunteers and civilian doctors and surgeons, but it isonly partly made up. Their numbers compare very unfavourably with thenumbers allotted to other nations' hospitals in the field. This has allbeen represented to the War Office many times of late years withoutresult.At the same time, with the men and accommodation they had, the hospitalshave done their utmost. In the base hospitals there was nothing tocomplain of. At Bloemfontein there was great suffering owing to lack ofmedical staff, surgeons, nurses, orderlies, &c., and also owing to thelack of necessary supplies and medical comforts. For the shortness ofthe staff the War Office is of course responsible, and as blaming theWar Office hurts nobody, I dare say the Commission will come down on itseverely. For the shortness of supplies, this was due to the working ofour line of communication, which considered the efficiency of the army agreat deal, and the lives of the sick very little. But here you come toindividuals, and the matter craves careful handling.It is no fun fighting for you people at home, because you don't knowwhen to clap. The English papers' account of Prinsloo's surrender havejust come in. By Jupiter, for all the notice you take of it, it might bethe capture of a Boer picket and a dozen men. Here have we been marchingand fighting and freezing and sweating and climbing up great Alpinemountains in the snow for weeks, and captured 4000 great ugly live Boersand all their guns and baggage, and by the god of war, you hardly takethe trouble to say thank you. This sort of thing will just suit Hunter,because his idea of bliss is to do the work and run the risk, and thensomehow to evade the praise. But he ought not to be allowed to evade it.It is true we had no war correspondents with us, but I should havethought the bare facts would have spoken for themselves. It was thefirst thing of the war and our one really big score off the Boers.However, I shall not discuss it any more. I am disgusted with you.Mafeking day is about your form.LETTER XXIVFIGHTING AND FARM-BURNINGFrankfort, _November 23_, 1900.Frankfort is one of our small garrison towns. It exists in a perpetualstate of siege, like Heilbron, Lindley, Ladybrand, Winberg, Bethlehem,and a dozen others in this neighbourhood; in fact, like all the townsheld by us not on the railway. At intervals of a month or two a columncomes along bringing supplies and news from the outside world; mails,papers, parcels, clothes and kit, great quantities of regular rations,ammunition, &c., &c. You can imagine how eagerly the little garrison,stranded for months in this aching desolation, looks for the column'scoming. Then arise other questions. Sometimes a part of the garrison isrelieved and receives orders to join the column, while some of thetroops forming the column are left behind in their place. Of courseevery one in the town is longing to get away, and every one in thecolumn is dreading having to stay, and there is an interval of ghastlyexpectation while contradictory rumours go hurtling from village to campand back again; and men look at each other like cannibals, every onehoping the doom will fall on some one else. We in our corps are sparedall this anxiety, and can lie on our backs and look on and condole withthe unlucky ones. We never get left anywhere.For the last few weeks we have been cruising about over the veldt fromone little British fort to another with our huge fleet of waggons,doling out supplies. During this time we have been fighting more orless, I think, every day. Perhaps you would hardly call it fighting;long-range sniping the greater part of it. Out of our 250 mounted men wehave had some half-dozen casualties only, and we have accounted for adozen or so of the enemy and a few prisoners. They have the advantage oftheir intimate knowledge of the country. We have the advantage of apompom and two 15-pounders. These are invaluable in keeping the Boers ata respectful distance. It is rather satisfactory to plump some shrapnelon to a group of waiting, watching Boers three miles off, who are justconcocting in their sinful hearts some scheme for getting a shot at you;or to lay a necklace of exploding pompom shells among some rocks whereyou guess they are hiding. "There, my boys, take that, and I hope youenjoy it," I feel inclined to say. You will understand that the sidethat has no guns at this game is apt to look rather silly. Rimington hasinitiated an entirely new use for guns. They are used now _with theScouts_. Instead of remaining with the column, where they would never beof the slightest use, he takes them right out to the limits of hisflankers or advance or rear guard, or wherever there is most need ofthem. So that when these scattered skirmishers get engaged, as they areconstantly doing, instead of having to extricate themselves as they bestcan from an awkward corner, and being followed up and hampered andpressed as they keep up with the column, they know that in about twominutes they will hear the voice of one of the 15-pounders or theindignant pompom speaking on their behalf, and that the pressure will beimmediately relieved. I am sure that the use made of these guns hassaved us a number of casualties, besides inflicting loss on the enemy.It isn't very orthodox, I fancy, and I have noticed officers of thecolumn rather stare sometimes at the sight of these volatile guns ofours careering away in the distance, but with the Colonel this is onlyanother reason for using them so. At the same time the pertinacity ofthese Dutchmen is really remarkable, and the instant the guns limber up,on they come, darting round corners and creeping upon us with a zealthat never seems to diminish.The work falls chiefly on front and rear guards, but perhaps mainly onthe rear, as the difficulty of retiring is usually greater thanadvancing; _i.e.,_ if the advance guard gets pressed, all they have todo is to sit tight and the natural advance of the column will bring themup supports. But when the rear guard gets engaged, the advance of themain column tends to leave it stranded; it is bound to keep on retiringto avoid this, and retiring under fire is a difficult and dangerous job.The Boers, who have an instinctive knowledge how to make themselves mostdisagreeable, of course know all about this susceptibility of arearguard, and there are always sure to be a number of them sniffingabout in that direction. "Where are you to-day?" "Rearguard." "Oh!_Good-bye, then!_" was the farewell given to a rearguard officer thismorning.On the other hand, the advance is of course the most exciting. You makea dash for a kopje, probably uncertain if it is held or not. Theclucking of the old Mausers at long range warns you that it is, and afew bullets kick the dust up. The squadron swing to the right to flankthe kopje, and the fire gets hotter and the whistle of bullets sharperand closer. Suddenly the welcome report of a gun, followed by a secondone, sounds behind you, and next instant the rush of the quick-comingshells is heard overhead. Then the squadron goes headlong for the kopje.The ponies tear along, mad with excitement, their hoofs thundering onthe hard ground. The men grip their loaded carbines with their righthands; not one that won't be first if he can. There go the shells! Thereis a little shout of approval; one bursts right among the rocks on thetop of the kopje in a puff of white smoke; the other half-way down,raising a great cloud of dust. The Mauser fire ceases as if by magic,and the next instant the racing squadron has reached the rise. Down jumpthe riders and clamber up over the stones. Yonder the enemy go, bundlingalong a rough track not 500 yards away, half seen through whirling dust.The men fling themselves down, some tearing a handful of cartridges fromtheir bandoliers to have handy, and settle their carbines on the rocks.Crack! goes the first shot, and at the sound, as at a signal, the coveyof fleeing Boers shakes out and scatters over the veldt. The firequickens rapidly as the carbines come into action. Every Boer as herides off, you can see through the glasses, is pursued and attended bylittle dust tufts that tell where the bullets strike. Surely they can'tbe going to get off scot-free. "Take your time, men; _now do take yourtime_," insists our captain. "A thousand yards, and aim well ahead!" Andnow at last it is seen with glee that something is the matter with theman on the white horse. Horse is it, or man? Both apparently. The manseems to be lying on his horse's neck, and the horse has lapsed into awalk. Instantly two of his comrades have turned to him. One beginsthrashing the horse with his rifle into a canter. The other seems to beholding the rider in the saddle. Every carbine is on to them. AnotherBoer jumps off and lies down, and the report of his rifle reaches us atthe same instant that a bullet whistles overhead. No one attends to him.Every man is blazing away at the little slow moving group of three, agood mark even at this distance. But it is not to be; though the dustspots are all round them, hit them we can't; and at last as they moveaway in the distance, the last reluctant shot is fired, and we give itup. On this particular occasion we capture one of the Boers a littlefurther on hidden in a farm garden, his horse having been shot, thoughwe did not notice it. This accounts for two anyway, which is about whatwe expect, and we proceed good-naturedly to help the farm people outwith some of their furniture before burning the house down.I am writing this lying on my back in our tiny tent. Outside the sun isblazing. Across the river, on the edge of the hill, our picket, underthe lee of a kraal wall, is shooting at intervals. It sounds as if someone in the distance were chopping wood. The Colonel and Driscoll arestanding just outside watching through their glasses. They can make outBoer scouts on the horizon, but no one pays much attention.Driscoll, of Driscoll's Scouts, is a thick-set, sinewy man, rather shortthan tall. He is of an absolute sooty blackness. Hair and moustachecoal-black, and complexion so scorched and swarthy that at a littledistance you might almost take him for a nigger. There is about his facea look of unmistakable determination amounting to ferocity in moments ofexcitement. He looks and is a born fighter, but is apt to be overheadlong in action. His scouts are part of our 250 mounted men underRimington.As for the Colonel I don't know if I have ever tried to describe him toyou. He is a man who invites description. Of all the men in the army heis the one you would single out to sketch. An artist would be at him atonce. He is the living image of what one imagines Brian de Bois Guilbertto have been. An inch or two over six feet high, his figure, spare butlengthy and muscular, has been so knocked about (by hunting and poloaccidents) that it has rather a lopsided look, and he leans slightly toone side as he walks, but this does not interfere with his strength andactivity nor detract from the distinguished and particularly gracefullook of the man. His face, like Driscoll's, is sun-blackened rather thansun-browned; its general expression stern and grim, and when he isthinking and talking about the Boers (he talks about them just as BoisGuilbert did about the Saracens) this expression deepens into somethingpositively savage, and he looks, and can perhaps sometimes be, arelentless enemy. But this is only half the man. In ordinary talk he isquite different. He has the Celtic sensitiveness and humour. He is anartist. His manner among friends is extraordinarily winning andsympathetic, and his grave melancholy face has a way of breaking into amost infectious laugh. Altogether, what with his tall person, darkdetermined face, his fierceness and gentleness, and the general air ofthe devil about him, you are not surprised to find that no soldier'sname is more common in men's mouths out here than Mike Rimington's. Youmight fit Marmion's lines to him well enough--    "His square-turned joints and length of limb    Show him no carpet knight so trim,    But in close fight a warrior grim."He ought to have lived five hundred years ago and dressed in chain-mailand led out his lances to plunder and foray. As it is he does his besteven in the nineteenth century. Picturesque is the word that bestdescribes him. He makes every one else look hopelessly commonplace. Hismen admire him immensely, like him a good deal, and fear him a little.Generals in command sometimes find him, I fancy, a bit of a handful,that is, if their policy is at all a backward one. But most people watchhim and talk of him with a certain interest, and whatever their opinionsor ideas of him may be, one feels sure that none who have once met willeasily forget him.He is essentially a man who means business, who believes that the armyis here to fight, and it is especially in action that he makes his valuefelt. Then, when he leads his squadron and the rifles begin to speak,and the first few shots come one by one like the first drops of ashower, and when he turns round in his saddle and thunders his, "Letthem go" down the ranks, then I tell you there is not a trooper at hisheels who does not realise that the man at their head is the right manin the right place.At the same time it would be a mistake to think of him as one of our"let me get at them," all sword and spurs officers. There have beenseveral of this sort in the army, and it is impossible to help veryoften admiring their dash. But they are most dangerous leaders. Whatchiefly distinguishes the Boers is their coolness. You cannot bluff orflurry them, or shift them by the impetuosity of your attack from aposition which they are strong enough to hold. If indeed you have reasonto believe them weak, then the faster you go at them the better: for ifthey mean going this will force them to go in a hurry and you willdiminish the time you are under fire. But see your calculations arepretty sound, for if they don't mean bolting it will not be the fury ofyour charge that will make them. Generally when they begin on you at avery long range it is safe to go for them; but if they reserve theirfire then look out for squalls. The Colonel has a very cool judgment inthese matters; and though no one, when he does go for them, goesstraighter and faster than he, no one, on the other hand, calculatesmore coolly the probable effect and consequence of the move.In all scouting operations in our frequent long patrols he shows thesame mixture of prudence and daring. He goes long distances from hissupports and penetrates far into the enemy's country, and yet in none ofthese expeditions has he ever got trapped or cut off. Of course with menlike the Guides, who have experience of the country and the enemy, andways of picking up information not open to strangers, this is easierthan it would be with men who had no such experience; but at the sametime the chief credit and responsibility in these affairs must rest withthe commanding officer. For one thing Rimington has an extraordinarygood eye for a country. Perhaps at first you will scarcely realise thevalue of this gift. The features of this country and the way the long,undulating slopes of the veldt merge into each other are extremelyperplexing, and as an engagement may be carried on over many miles ofground and your own movements may be extensive and involved, it becomesvery difficult, in fact to most people absolutely impossible, toremember the lie of the land and how the various hills and slopes arerelated to each other. Thinking about it and trying to observe does nogood at all; but some people have an extraordinary instinct by whichthey hold the configuration of the ground mapped in their head; judgingnot by slow calculation and an effort of the memory, but intuitively andat once. This instinct is called "an eye for a country," and is a mostvaluable gift. Personally, I am very ill equipped with it, which makesme the more inclined perhaps to admire it in others. It is developed inthe Colonel to an extraordinary degree, and is one of the chief means bywhich, however hard beset, he has always been able, so far, to find away out. Most nearly of any of our officers his tactics in daring and incraft resemble the tactics of that prince of scouting officers,Christian De Wet.Kronstadt, Lindley, Heilbron, Frankfort, has been our round so far. Wenow turn westward along the south of the Vaal. Farm burning goes merrilyon, and our course through the country is marked as in prehistoric ages,by pillars of smoke by day and fire by night. We usually burn from sixto a dozen farms a day; these being about all that in thissparsely-inhabited country we encounter. I do not gather that anyspecial reason or cause is alleged or proved against the farms burnt. IfBoers have used the farm; if the owner is on commando; if the linewithin a certain distance has been blown up; or even if there are Boersin the neighbourhood who persist in fighting--these are some of thereasons. Of course the people living in the farms have no say in thesematters, and are quite powerless to interfere with the plans of thefighting Boers. Anyway we find that one reason or other generally coverspretty nearly every farm we come to, and so to save trouble we burn thelot without inquiry; unless, indeed, which sometimes happens, some namesare given in before marching in the morning of farms to be spared.The men belonging to the farm are always away and only the women left.Of these there are often three or four generations; grandmother, mother,and family of girls. The boys over thirteen or fourteen are usuallyfighting with their papas. The people are disconcertingly like English,especially the girls and children--fair and big and healthy looking.These folk we invite out on to the veldt or into the little garden infront, where they huddle together in their cotton frocks and big cottonsun-bonnets, while our men set fire to the house. Sometimes they entreatthat it may be spared, and once or twice in an agony of rage they haveinvoked curses on our heads. But this is quite the exception. As a rulethey make no sign, and simply look on and say nothing. One young womanin a farm yesterday, which I think she had not started life long in,went into a fit of hysterics when she saw the flames breaking out, andfinally fainted away.I wish I had my camera. Unfortunately it got damaged, and I have notbeen able to take any photographs. These farms would make a goodsubject. They are dry and burn well. The fire bursts out of windows anddoors with a loud roaring, and black volumes of smoke roll overhead.Standing round are a dozen or two of men holding horses. The women, in alittle group, cling together, comforting each other or hiding theirfaces in each other's laps. In the background a number of Tommies areseen chasing poultry, flinging stones, and throwing themselves prostrateon maimed chickens and ducks, whose melancholy squawks fill the air.Further off still, herds and flocks and horses are being collected anddriven off, while, on the top of the nearest high ground, a party ofmen, rifles in hand, guard against a surprise from the enemy, a few ofwhom can generally be seen in the distance watching the destruction oftheir homes.One hears the women talk. Their ideas about the war are peculiar, forthey all maintain that they will succeed in the long-run in assertingtheir independence, and seem to think that things are going quitesatisfactorily for them. "Of course we shall go on fighting," they say,quite with surprise. "How long?" "Oh, as long as may be necessary. Tillyou go away." It is curious coming to household after household andfinding the whole lot of them, women and children, so unanimous, soagreed in the spirit in which they face their afflictions. Husbands andsons in the hill fighting. Homes in the valley blazing, and they sittingand watching it all, almost always with the same fortitude, the samepatience, and the same resolve. I am impressed, for I have never seenanything of the sort before. It is not often in these days that you seeone big, simple, primitive instinct, like love of country, acting on awhole people at once. Many of our officers, the thoughtful andcandid-minded ones, do these people justice; but many don't. Many catchat any explanation but the true one, and attribute every kind of motivesave the only one that will explain the facts. They refuse to call theBoers patriots, but that the Boers are prepared to face a slowextermination in defence of their country is now evident. It has becomemore evident since the war has assumed its present character ofindividual, personal effort. I much respect and admire them for it.It is time to bring this long letter to an end. I wish I could see anend to the campaign. When I come home "an old, old, aged and infirm oldman," I mean to pass the evening of my days in a quiet cottage with itsfull allowance of honeysuckle and roses. There I shall grow sweetwilliams and, if I can stand the extra excitement, perhaps keep a pig.They tell me the _Times_ has pronounced the war over. I would be glad topay L5 out of my own pocket to have the man who wrote that out here onthe veldt with us for a week. We have just heard that Dewetsdorp hasfallen, and that there is a rising in the Colony near Aliwal North._Vogue la galere!_LETTER XXVTHE SITUATION  CAMP ON THE VAAL,  NEAR KLERKSDORP,  _December 23_, 1900.We are encamped close to the Vaal, which is here a fine stream, as wideas the Thames at Richmond. I have just been bathing in it. It is earlymorning, and I am sitting under a thicket of great weeping willows bythe river. The banks slope down and make a trough for the stream a gooddeal below the level of the plain, and in this hollow, hidden till youare close to it, congregates all the verdure there is for miles,especially a quantity of willow trees, with gnarled black trunks leaningdown to the stream, sometimes bending over and burying themselves in theground and then shooting up again, making arches and long vistas, withgreen grass below and silvery foliage waving above. After our longmarches on the veldt, the contrast here is wonderfully refreshing. Oneseems to drink in the coolness and greenness of the scene with eyes thathave grown thirsty for such things. The trees straddling down the bankare rather like figures of men, giants that have flung themselves down,resting on hands and elbows, delighted, one would think, as I am, tocome and rest near water again.I can hardly believe that it only wants two days to Christmas. Our lastChristmas we spent on the Modder. I remember it well; a wet night, andall night long we sat on a steep kopje watching the lights of a Boerlaager and expecting to be attacked. Methuen's little campaign strikesone now as a sort of prelude, or overture, to the main show; but howvery much surprised we should have been that November morning when wemarched from Orange River Camp if you had told us we should ever belooked at in that light. Ten thousand men was a big army in those days.We have been on the trek now for about six weeks with Bruce-Hamilton,and though we have not so far been seriously engaged, there has beenalmost daily fighting round the fringes and skirts of the column("skirt-fighting," you may call it)."_November_ 17.--Left Lindley. This neighbourhood quite as disturbed asever. Shooting."_November_ 18.--More shooting. Boers in all hills."_November_ 19.--More shooting and galloping about. Reached Heilbron."_November_ 20.--Left for Frankfort. Boers in attendance as usual. Ourtwo guns and pompom very useful."Those were the last entries I made in my diary. The day's events becametoo monotonous to chronicle, but very much the same sort of entrieswould have applied to almost every day since. Sometimes there areexciting incidents. Yesterday half-a-dozen Boers hid in a little hollowwhich just concealed them until our column came along, and opened fireat close range on the flank guard. One or two men were hit and severalhorses. My friend Vice had five bullets through his horse and was nottouched himself, which was rather lucky for him (or unlucky for thehorse). A few days before that we were camped on the river and had apicket on the other side. Two or three Boers crept up the river rightbetween our picket and the main body, and then walked straight to thepicket as if coming from us and fired into it at point-blank range. Theymortally wounded one of our men and in the dusk escaped. They are ascunning as Indians. Sometimes, as in these cases, they show greatcoolness and daring, while at others they are easily dispersed; but theyare generally pretty keen, and you have to be very much on the alert indealing with them.You at home will probably be annoyed to find the war dragging on so.About election time the papers were announcing that it was over. It hadbeen a hard job, they said, but it was finished at last. A good deal wasoccurring out here which did not quite tally with that theory, but thosethings were ignored or very slightly referred to, so that we on the spotwondered to see the war drop out of sight, and were puzzled to read inthe _Times_ that only a few desperadoes remained in the field just atthe time that two commandoes were invading the Colony, another raidingNatal, a garrison and two guns captured at Dewetsdorp, and the lineblown up in ten different places. The continuance of the war must strikeyou as a renewal, but there was never a lull really.People who think the war can be ended by farm-burning, &c., mistake theBoer temper. I scarcely know how to convey to you any idea of thespirit of determination that exists among them all, women and evenchildren as well as men. The other day I picked up at a farmhouse ashort characteristic form of prayer, written out evidently by the wifein a child's copybook, ending thus: "Forgive me all my sins for the sakeof your Son Jesus Christ, in whom I put all my trust for days of sorrowand pain. And bring back my dear husband and child and brothers, andgive us our land back again, which we paid for with blood from thebeginning." Simple enough as you see, and no particular cant about it,but very much in earnest. At another farm a small girl interrupted herpreparation for departure to play indignantly their national anthem atus on an old piano. We were carting the people off. It was raining hardand blowing--a miserable, hurried home-leaving; ransacked house, muddysoldiers, a distracted mother saving one or two trifles and pushingalong her children to the ox-waggon outside, and this poor little wretchin the midst of it all pulling herself together to strum a finaldefiance. One smiled, but it was rather dramatic all the same, andexactly like a picture. These are straws, but one could multiply themwith incidents from every farm we go to. Their talk is invariably, andwithout so far a single exception, to the same effect--"We will nevergive in, and God sooner or later will see us through."And then I see a speech of Buller's explaining that the war is beingcarried on by a few mercenaries and coerced men, and that it is in nosense a patriotic war. He is emphatic on this point and his audiencecheer him. One realises the difficulty of getting you to understand. Thebreaking up of the big commandoes and the change to guerilla tactics, inwhich every man fights on his own account, shows in a way there is nomistaking that it is the personal wish of each man to fight out thequarrel to the last. It is just because they are so individually keenthat this sort of warfare of theirs is so hard to cope with. These menare uncoerced. Spontaneously and one by one they turn out to fight us assoon as we show ourselves in their neighbourhood, and all the sufferingwe can inflict only serves to harden their resolution.Yet we certainly inflict a great deal. Boer families usually average upto a dozen. They stick together, and grow up on their farms, which areof enormous extent, and which they get to love with the instinctiveforce of people who have never seen any other place. Love of family andlove of home are their two ruling affections. The household life of abig family on a 20,000 acre farm--three and often four generationsrepresented--is usually uninterrupted for weeks at a time by the sightof a strange face or a bit of outside news. Their lives are altogetherbound up, in their serene and stolid way, with each other and with theirhomes. Anything that breaks up a family is felt by them more grievouslythan would be the case with most people; and, in the same way, anythingthat severs them from "the land" would be more profoundly felt too. Itamounts to an entire dislocation of their ideas of life.This must make the war at present very hard to bear. "My dear husbandand child and brothers" are away fighting. One or two of them verylikely killed by this time, or in Ceylon or St. Helena. "And as for theothers who are still in the field, we are in constant terror of hearingthe bad news, which we know, if the war continues, must some day come."So the family is quite broken up, and now the home is being destroyedand the occupants carried off, so that altogether the chances of everrenewing the old life again in the old place seem very remote indeed.All this should be enough to break Boer hearts, and there is no doubtthey feel it very much. I can recall many scenes and incidents whichshow that--scenes which, if you saw them out of your peaceful, naturallife, you would perhaps be never able to forget. But yet, in spite ofall they have to suffer, their determination remains just the same.Anything like loud lamentations or complaints are almost unheard. Theyrise to the occasion, and though naturally a very simple people, whoexpress openly what they feel, they act now in this crisis with aconstant composure which I have often thought most remarkable.What supports them and keeps them going is just that spirit ofpatriotism which Buller denies the existence of. A patriot is a man whoputs his country first thing of all. The final result of it all, "theuselessness of prolonging the struggle," and such newspaper talk asthat, is not for him. There fronts him one fact, his country is invaded;and there fronts him one duty, to fight till he dies for it. This wouldhave been a Greek's definition of the word, and it is the Boer farmer'sdefinition. It is of course just because patriots never do count thecost, and are what the newspapers call "deaf to reason," that theysometimes bring off such astonishing results.The Boers have now to watch a slow, implacable, methodical devastationof their country, tract by tract. Day by day they fight, and one by onethey fall. Comrades and friends drop at each other's sides; sons drop byfathers, and brothers by brothers. The smoke rises in the valley, andthe home is blotted out. All that makes life worth living goes, thenlife itself. What sterner test can a nation be put to than this? It is atorture long and slow; the agony and bloody sweat. I know well that ifmy own country were invaded I should, or hope I should, behave exactlyas these men are doing; and as I should call it patriotism in my owncase, I cannot refuse to call it the same in theirs. You see bribery andcoercion are not adequate motives, and do not explain the facts; only,unfortunately, a lot of people would rather hunt up any base motive,however inadequate, than take the obvious one if it did their enemy anycredit.It is most important that the situation should be realised at home, forif it were the conduct of the war would be changed. You cannot tortureand terrorise men like this into submission. Probably no system will endthe war off quickly, but certainly kind, or at least fair, treatment isthe best chance and best policy in every way. The present system hardensthese men's resolution to iron, and so tends to prolong the war; and itembitters Dutch hatred of the British, and so tends to perpetuate theill effects of the war. In fact, I am convinced that it is the worstpolicy you could possibly adopt, and the sooner you change it thebetter.As for the fighting itself, you must make great allowance for ourdifficulties. So long as we had big commandoes with guns, convoys, &c.,to deal with, there was a definite object to hit at. It was possible todeal a blow that took effect. Now we are fighting shadows. Our columnsmarch through the country and see no enemy, or at most only a few smallparties hovering on the sky-line. Scouts and patrols are often engaged,and no one can wander out of sight of the column but the ugly voice of aMauser will warn him back. Invisible eyes watch us all the time, readyto take advantage of detached parties or unprotected convoys. We areteased and annoyed, but never definitely engaged. We are like thetraveller and the gnats--    "Nor could my weak arm disperse    The host of insects gathered round my head,    And ever with me as I walked along."Carried on in a country like this, where a man on horseback is like abird in the air, and by people so individually keen as the Boers, thepresent kind of war may go on indefinitely. After all, it is the sort ofwar the Boers understand best. The big-battle war is a matter of sciencewhich he had in a great measure to be instructed in, but this is a warwhich the natural independence of his own character and self-relianthabits make natural to him. The war, now that it has become a matter ofindividuals, is exciting all its old enthusiasm again, and the Burghersare up in arms in every district in the country. Fighting in their owncountry, the Boers have one advantage over us, which is their salvation:they can disperse in flight, but we cannot disperse in pursuit.This vagrant form of war is more formidable than it sounds. Thesewandering bands can unite with great rapidity and deal when leastexpected a rapid blow. As we cannot catch them we must be prepared toreceive them at all points. The veldt is a void to us, all darkness, andit hides a threat which, as it may fall anywhere, must be guardedagainst everywhere. This, what with all our garrisons and enormous linesof communication, means that the far greater part of our army has to acton the defensive; to sit still waiting for an enemy who may be a hundredmiles off or behind the next hill. As for our wandering columns, theyhave about as much chance of catching Boers on the veldt as a LordMayor's procession would have of catching a highwayman on HounslowHeath. The enemy are watching us now from a rise a few miles away,waiting for our next move, and probably discussing some devilry or otherthey are up to. The line of our march is blotted out already. Where wecamp one day they camp the next. They are all round and about us likewater round a ship, parting before our bows and reuniting round ourstern. Our passage makes no impression and leaves no visible trace. Itdoes amuse me to read the speeches and papers in England with theirtalk of what we are to do with the country now we have conquered it."With the conclusion of the war in South Africa arises the question,"&c., &c. It reminds one of a child's game of make-believe. There is thesame pompous air of reality. "This is the shop and you are theshopwoman. Good morning, Mrs. Snooks, I have come to buy a pound ofsugar." Unfortunately the facts remain. I find that some of theshrewdest onlookers out here are just beginning to feel a sort of halfdoubt whether we shall ever conquer the country at all. It depends onwhether the home Government and press give up their babyish "let'spretend" attitude and face the difficulties of the situation.All this is very sad and lugubrious, is it not? and I daresay you thinkme a croaker; but there is a melancholy satisfaction in trying to seethings as they are, and I believe what I have told you is nearer thetruth than what you get from the papers. I only hope I may turn out tobe wrong.I add a note (January 12th) from Ventersberg, where we have justarrived. This has been our last trek, we believe. Rimington takescommand of his regiment, and the corps, like the rest of the ColonialDivision, will be paid off. I have a vision of a great blue steamer witha bow like a cliff bursting her way through the seas on her homewardvoyage. And yet I can scarcely believe it.Bad news waits us here. They say the Colony is rising. Now mark mywords. If we don't watch it, we shall end by bringing about the verystate of things we have been dreading. There will be a Dutch SouthAfrican conspiracy, but it will be one of our own making. We shall haveour own treatment of these people to thank for it. Be sure of this, thatfor every house up here that is destroyed, three or four in the southare slowly rousing to arms.You will think, I daresay, that I have been putting the caseone-sidedly. Possibly that is so; but I am putting the side that wantsputting. I am constantly seeing it stated that any measures arejustifiable so long as they are likely to end the war. "Well, but wemust end it somehow," is a common phrase. That is all rubbish. We mustfight fairly, that's the first rule of all. I daresay there may havebeen individual acts of cruelty or treachery on the part of the Boers,but I am sure that any just and unprejudiced officer will tell you thaton the whole they have behaved surprisingly well, and in a way that isreally very striking when we consider how undisciplined and individuallyindependent they are. Let us then, on our side, play the game fairly. Nodoubt it is very exasperating to have the thing dragging on in the wayit is doing, and the present intangible, elusive warfare is desperatelyirritating, but there is after all nothing unfair about these tactics ofthe Boers, nothing illegitimate in any way; they are merely the turningto account of natural advantages; and this being the case, we have noright to lose our tempers and get vicious just because we have taken ona tougher job than we thought for. Unluckily there seems to be a bigparty who are prepared to do anything and fight anyhow to get the thingfinished. You will gain nothing by those means. You will not hasten theend of the war, and you will make its after effects more lasting andhard to deal with.[2]FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 2: Here is a telegram copied from the _Evening Standard_ ofOctober 16, 1901. "Addressing the volunteers who have returned from thefront, the Governor of Natal this morning said that he could not nowrefer to the Boers as dogs of war, but rather as yelping, snarlingcurs." As against that take the opinion of Lord Cranborne who has justcome back from the front: "They had fought and they were fighting withsome of the bravest, some of the most tenacious, and some of the mostadmirable troops that the nation had ever had to encounter;" and he endshis speech: "Personally he had, as one who had served as a soldier inSouth Africa, a great admiration for the Boers themselves." What Isubmit is, that it makes the whole difference to your chances of asettlement whether you speak of and regard your enemy as brave andadmirable, or as a yelping cur. We shall have to settle down with thesepeople sooner or later, and every paltry insult uttered and countenancedagainst them only makes the process much more difficult. The odd thingis that even in England they seem to excite no surprise or dissent. Theyare printed as a natural comment on the situation. What I always feelis, now as when I was out there, that the chances of a future agreementwould be very much improved if the English people were to treat theBoers in the way that brave enemies ought to be treated, with a certainamount of courtesy and respect.]LETTER XXVIPLAIN MISTER!Cape Town.I am trying to din the fact into my head that I am a civilian again andnot a soldier any more. It is difficult. I find myself lookingquestioningly at my suit of grey flannel. It feels like a disguise. Nosoldiers' hands as I pass them rise in salute now, though my owninvoluntarily half rises in answer They look at me and take no notice. Arecruiting sergeant tried to induce me this morning to join an irregularcorps. He told me I should get five shillings a day, and that it was afine life and a beautiful country.And yet I know that, in a few days even, the civilian life that seems sounreal now will be the real, and the old soldier life the unreal. Ishall not in my walks find my eyes wandering "with a vague surmise" overthe nearest hilltops in search of Boers, nor measuring unconsciously therange from the top of Table Mountain, which I find myself doing even asI write this, looking up at it through the window. The trekking, thefighting, the croak of the invisible rifle, the glare of the sun, therow of swarthy determined faces, the roar of horse hoofs, all this, andthe lounging days by river banks (shooting guinea-fowl and springbuck),will drop back and be shut off from one's life to rise now and then, Isuppose, with the creeping of an old excitement in one's memory.There was a heavy gloom on the last days of my soldiering. It was atNaauwpoort that I first joined the Guides. We stopped there coming down.There was the waiting-room, the very table I had slept on; the sun-bakedflat where first I met the Major; the slopes where our tents werepitched--Lord! how the sight of the place brings it all back, and howdifferent everything has turned out from what we expected; it was therethat I joined, and it was there, travelling down with our time-expiredmen, that we first heard the news of the Queen's death. You at home willfeel this deeply--of course every one must--but I can't help thinkingthat out here, far away from home and fighting, one feels it even more.I am almost surprised at minding so much. There is an irksome sense atthe back of one's mind, even when one is thinking of other things--ofloss, of something wanting. England seems less England to me than it didand I less of an Englishman. It gives a faint satisfaction to have beenone of her soldiers at the end.I will spare you my raptures on reaching Cape Town and seeing the woodsand clear streams and sea again. The change from a comparatively barrencountry to the richly-wooded slopes under Table Mountain, and the burstof sparkling sea beyond is quite sudden. At one step, in the twinklingof an eye, you pass from monotony and desolation and the old life of theveldt into everything that is most lovely and suggestive of freedom andvariety. Huge Table Mountain rises high over the town, its steep slopeswooded with forests of pine and oak. Gorge-like narrow passages windinto the upright precipices of rock and separate them into greatpinnacles of grey stone. I clambered up there a few days ago, throughhot-smelling pine woods, heaths of all sorts, evergreens and flowers,clear water like Scotch burns coming down among the rocks with its tossof white froth and amber pools, and such a view, when one got to thetop, down over the whispering woods and out over the flat sea!The sea was the thing that beat all--"the great sea perfect as aflower,"--the sight of it was a stab. There are great four-mastedbarques and full-rigged ships lying at the wharfs and outside--doublet'gallant yarders, my boy; I yelled at them by way of greeting downacross the tree-tops.Nearer in lies a long black steamer, a transport. She is an ugly lookingold tub, but in my eyes perfect. Handsome is as handsome does. She takesus home to-morrow, my pony and me.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of With Rimington, by L.

I do not suppose that any gentleman occupying this positionwould be guilty of so much disrespect to the many eminent names whichhave already appeared in your columns, as would be implied in not givingall the attention it deserved to any communication you might see fit topublish; and with this feeling, and under this shelter, I return to thesubject of Marlowe, and his position as a dramatic writer relative toShakspeare. I perceive that a re-issue of Mr. Knight's _Shakspeare_ hascommenced, and from the terms of the announcement, independently ofother considerations, I conclude that the editor will take advantage ofthis opportunity of referring to doubtful or disputed points that mayhave made any advance towards a solution since his previous editions. Ihave read also an advertisement of an edition of Shakspeare, to besuperintended by Mr. Halliwell[1], which is to contain the plays of"doubtful authenticity, or in the composition of which Shakspeare issupposed only to have taken a part." Neither of these gentlemen can wellavoid expressing an opinion on the subject I have adverted to, and tothem more especially I would address my observations.I think I have observed that the claims of Marlowe have been maintainedwith something very like party spirit. I have seen latterly severalindications of this, unmistakeable, though expressed, perhaps, but by asingle word. Now it is true both Mr. Collier and Mr. Dyce are committedto a positive opinion on this subject; and it would be unreasonable toexpect either of those gentlemen to change their views, except with thefullest proof and after the maturest consideration. But who, besidesthese, is interested in maintaining the precedence of Marlowe? Theseremarks have been called forth by an article in the _Athenaeum_,containing the following passages:--    "All Marlowe's works were produced prior, we may safely assert,    to the appearance of Shakspeare _as a writer for the stage_, or    as an author, in print.    "It is now universally admitted among competent critics, that    Shakspeare commenced his career as a dramatic author, by    remodelling certain pieces written {370} either separately or    conjointly by Greene, Marlowe, Lodge, and Peele."An anonymous writer commits himself to nothing, and I should not havenoticed the above but that they illustrate my position. In the passagefirst cited, if the writer mean "as a writer for the stage _in print_,"it proves nothing; but if the words "in print" are not intended to be soconnected, the assertion cannot be proved, and _many_ "competentcritics" will tell him it is most improbable. The assertion of thesecond quotation is simply untrue; Mr. Knight has not admitted what isstated therein, and if I recollect right, an Edinburgh Reviewer hasconcurred with him in judgment. Neither of these, I presume, will becalled incompetent. I cannot suppose that either assertion would havebeen made but for the spirit to which I have alluded; for no cause wasever the better for allegations that could not be maintained.In some former papers which you did me the honour to publish, I gave itincidentally as my opinion that Marlowe was the author of the _Taming ofa Shrew_. I have since learned, through Mr. Halliwell, that Mr. Dyce isconfident, from the style, that he was not. Had I the opportunity, Imight ask Mr. Dyce "which style?" That of the passages I cited as beingidentical with passages in Marlowe's acknowledged plays will not, Ipresume, be disputed; and of that of such scenes as the one betweenSander and the tailor, I am as confident as Mr. Dyce; it is the stylerather of Shakspeare than Marlowe. In other respects, I learn that thekind of evidence that is considered by Mr. Dyce good to sustain theclaim of Marlowe to the authorship of the _Contention_ and the _TrueTragedy_, is not admissible in support of his claim to the _Taming of aShrew_. I shall take another opportunity of showing that the verypassages cited by Mr. Dyce from the two first-named of these plays willsupport my view of the case, at least as well as his; doing no more nowthan simply recording an _opinion_ that Marlowe was a follower andimitator of Shakspeare. I do not know that I am at present in a positionto maintain this opinion by argument; but I can, at all events, show onwhat exceedingly slight grounds the contrary opinion has been founded.I have already called attention to the fact, that the impression ofMarlowe's being an earlier writer than Shakspeare, was founded solelyupon the circumstance that his plays were printed at an earlier date.That nothing could be more fallacious than this conclusion, the factthat many of Shakspeare's earliest plays were not printed at all untilafter his death is sufficient to evince. The motive for withholdingShakspeare's plays from the press is as easily understood as that forpublishing Marlowe's. Thus stood the question when Mr. Collierapproached the subject. Meanwhile it should be borne in mind, that not asyllable of evidence has been advanced to show that Shakspeare could nothave written the _First part of the Contention_ and the _True Tragedy_,if not the later forms of _Henry VI._, _Hamlet_ and _Pericles_ in theirearliest forms, if not _Timon of Athens_, which I think is also an earlyplay revised, _Love's Labour's Lost_, _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_,&c., all of which I should place at least seven years distance fromplays which I think were acted about 1594 or 1595. I now proceed to givethe kernel of Mr. Collier's argument, omitting nothing that is reallyimportant to the question:--    "'Give me the man' (says Nash) 'whose extemporal vein, in any    humour, will excel our greatest _art masters_' deliberate    thoughts.'    "Green, in 1588, says he had been 'had in derision' by 'two    gentlemen poets' because I could not make my verses get on the    stage in tragical buskins, every word filling the mouth like the    faburden of Bow-bell, daring God out of heaven with that atheist    tamburlane, or blaspheming with the mad priest of the sun.    Farther on he laughs at the 'prophetical spirits' of those 'who    set the end of scholarism in an _English blank-verse_.'    "Marlowe took his degree of _Master of Arts_ in the very year    when Nash was unable to do so, &c.    "I thus arrive at the conclusion, that Christopher Marlowe was    our first poet who used blank-verse in dramatic compositions    performed in public theatres."--_Hist. of Dramatic Poetry_, vol.    iii. pp. 110, 111, 112.This is literally all; and, I ask, can any "conclusion" be much moreinconclusive? Yet Mr. Collier has been so far misled by the deferencepaid to him on the strength of his unquestionably great services, andappears to have been so fully persuaded of the correctness of hisdeduction, that he has since referred to as a _proved fact_ what isreally nothing more than an exceedingly _loose conjecture_.Of the two editors whose names I have mentioned, Mr. Knight's hithertoexpressed opinions in reference to the early stage of Shakspeare'scareer in a great measure coincide with mine; and I have no reason tosuppose that it is otherwise than an open question to Mr. Halliwell. Forsatisfactory proof in support of my position, time only, I firmlybelieve, is required; but the first stage in every case is to remove thefalse conclusion that has been drawn, to weaken its impression, and toreduce it to its true value; and that I have endeavoured to do in thepresent paper. In conclusion, I take the opportunity of saying, as thecircumstance in some degree bears upon the present question, that theevidence in support of the priority of Shakspeare's _Taming of theShrew_ to the so-called older play which I withheld, together with whatI have collected since my last paper on the subject, is I think strongereven than that which I communicated.SAMUEL HICKSON.October, 1850.[Footnote 1: This communication was written and in our hands before theappearance of Mr. Halliwell's advertisement and letter to _The Times_,announcing that the edition of Shakspeare advertised as _to be_ editedby him and published by the Messrs. Tallis, is only a reprint of anedition, with Notes and Introductions by Mr. Halliwell, which wascommenced at New York some months ago.--ED.]       *       *       *       *       * {371}A PLAN FOR A CHURCH-HISTORY SOCIETY.The formation of a Society, having for its object any special literaryservice, is a matter so closely connected with the very purpose forwhich this paper was established, that we shall only be carrying outthat purpose by calling the attention of our readers to a small pamphletin which our valued correspondent DR. MAITLAND offers a few suggestionsto all who may be interested in the formation of a "CHURCH-HISTORYSOCIETY, and willing to co-operate in such a design."DR. MAITLAND'S suggestions are:1. The collection of a library containing the books particularlyrequired for the objects of the proposed society: and those who have notpaid attention to the subject will perhaps be surprised to learn that inDR. MAITLAND'S opinion (and few higher authorities can be found on thispoint), "A moderate-sized room would hold such a library, and a very fewhundred pounds would pay for it." On the advantage of this plan to theeditors of the works to be published by the Society, it can scarcely benecessary to insist; but other benefits would result from the formationof such a library, for which we may refer, however, to the pamphletitself.The next points treated of are the works to be undertaken by theSociety; which may briefly be described as2. New and corrected editions of works already known and esteemed;critical editions, for instance, of such well-known writers as Fox,Fuller, Burnet, and Strype: and the completion, by way of "posting up,"of such as have become defective through lapse of time, like Le Neve's_Fasti_, Godwin's _De Presulibus_, &c.3. The compilation of such original works as may be considereddesiderata. A General Church-History on such a scale, and so farentering into details as to interest a reader, is not to be found in ourlanguage; nor has the Church of England any thing like the _GalliaChristiana_ or _Italia Sacra_. We mention these merely as instances,referring, of course, for further illustration to the pamphlet itself,merely quoting the following paragraph:--    "But on the subject of publication, I must add one thing more,    which appeals to me to be of vital importance to the    respectability and efficiency of such a Society. It must not    build its hopes, and stake its existence, on the cupidity of    subscribers--it must not live on appeals to their    covetousness--it must not be, nor act as if it were, a    joint-stock company formed to undersell the trade. It must not    rest on the chance of getting subscribers who will shut their    eyes, and open their mouths, and take what is given them, on a    mere assurance that it shall be more in quantity for the money,    than a bookseller can afford to offer."DR. MAITLAND's fourth section, on the _Discovery of Materials_, temptsus to further extracts. After remarking that    "It would be a most important and valuable part of the Society's    work to discover in various ways--chiefly by the employing fit    persons to look for, inspect, and make known--such materials for    Church-History as remain unpublished."And    "That no person, not wholly illiterate and ignorant of    Church-History, could go about the metropolis only, seeking    after such matters during one month, without gathering into his    note-book much valuable matter."The Doctor proceeds:    "By those who have not been led to consideration or inquiry upon    the subject, this may be deemed a mere speculation; but those    who are even slightly acquainted with the real state of things,    will, I believe agree with me that if men, respectable and in    earnest and moderately informed, would only set about the    matter, they would soon be astonished at the ease and rapidity    with which they would accumulate interesting and valuable    matter. Transcribing and printing, it is admitted, are expensive    processes, and little could be effected by them at first; but    merely to make known to the world by hasty, imperfect, even    blundering, lists or indexes, that things unsought and unknown    _exist_, would be an invaluable benefit."We pass over the section on _Correspondence_, and that on theestablishment of _Provincial Societies_; but from the last, _On thePrivileges of Members_, we quote at even greater length.    "It is but honest to confess in plain terms, that the chief and    most obvious privilege of members at first, is likely to be    little more than a satisfactory belief that they are doing a    good work, and serving their generation. In a word, the    nicely-balanced _quid pro quo_ is not offered. It might be    prudent for the present to confine one's self to a positive    assurance that the Society will, at the worst, make as good a    return as several other societies formed for the promotion and    cultivation of other branches of knowledge. If subscribers will    only be content to pay as much, and receive as little, as the    fellows of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, the    Church-History Society will thrive. But considering the nature    and object of the proposed Society, I cannot help expressing my    confidence that there are many Christian people who will give    their money freely, and no more wish to have part of it    returned, than if they had put it into a plate at a    church-door--let them only be satisfied that it will not be    embezzled or turned into waste paper.    "At the same time, the members of the Society might derive some    legitimate benefits. They would have constantly increasing    advantages from the use of their library, which would gradually    become, not only rich in books, but in transcripts, catalogues,    indexes, notices, &c., not to be found together elsewhere. Of    all these they would have a right to as much use and advantage    as joint-proprietors could enjoy without hindrance to each    other. With regard to works published by the Society, they might    reasonably expect to be supplied {372} with such as they should    choose to possess, on the same terms as if they were the    authors, or the owners of the copyright. These, however, are    details which, with many others, must be settled by the    managers; they are not mentioned as matters of primary    importance or inducement."DR. MAITLAND concludes by observing, that he should not have ventured topublish his plan, had he not been encouraged to do so by some whosejudgment he respected; and by inviting all who may approve or sanctionthe plan, to make known (either by direct communication to himself, orin any other way) their willingness to support such a Society, and theamount of contribution, or annual donation, which, if the design iscarried out, may be expected from them. Of course such expressions ofopinion would be purely conditional, and would not pledge the writers tosupport the Society if, when organised, they did not approve of thearrangements; but it is clear no such arrangements can well be madeuntil something, is known as to the amount of support which may beexpected.We have entered at some length upon this _Plan of a Church-HistorySociety_, and have quoted largely from DR. MAITLAND's pamphlet, becausewe believe the subject to be one likely to interest a large body of ourreaders, who might otherwise not have their attention called to aproposal calculated to advance one of the most important branches ofhistorical learning.       *       *       *       *       *BURNET AS A HISTORIAN.The following extract from Charles Lamb ought to be added to the_testimonia_ already given by "NOTES AND QUERIES" (Vol. i., pp. 40. 181.341. 493.):--    "_Burnet's Own Times._--Did you ever read that garrulous,    pleasant history? He tells his story like an old man past    political service, bragging to his sons on winter evenings of    the part he took in public transactions when his 'old cap was    new.' Full of scandal, which all true history is. So palliative;    but all the stark wickedness that actually gives the _momentum_    to national actors. Quite the prattle of age and outlived    importance. Truth and sincerity staring out upon you perpetually    _in alto relievo_. Himself a party-man, he makes you a    party-man. None of the cursed philosophical Humeian    indifference, 'so cold and unnatural and inhuman.' None of the    cursed Gibbonian fine writing, so fine and composite. None of    Dr. Robertson's periods with three members. None of Mr. Roscoe's    sage remarks, all so apposite and coming in so clever, lest the    reader should have had the trouble of drawing an inference.    Burnet's good old prattle I can bring present to my mind; I can    make the Revolution present to me."--_Charles Lamb: Letters_.GUSTAVE MASSON.Hadley, near Barnet._Bishop Burnet_.--An Epigram on the Reverend Mr. Lawrence Eachard's andBishop Gilbert Burnet's Histories.

His sharp and strong incision pen,  Historically cuts up men,  And does with lucid skill impart  Their inward ails of head and heart.  Lawrence proceeds another way,  And well-dressed figures does display:  His characters are all in flesh,  Their hands are fair, their faces fresh;  And from his sweet'ning art derive  A better scent than when alive;  He wax-work made to please the sons,  Whose fathers were Gil's skeletons."From a _Collection of Poems by several hands_.

Cooke Taylor, in the introduction to his elegant reprint of_Chapman's Homer_, says of George Chapman, that "he died on the 12th ofMay, 1655, and was buried at the south side of St. Giles's Church." Thedate here is an error; for 1655 we should read 1634.Sir Egerton Brydges, in his edition of Phillip's _Theatrum Poetarum_(Canterbury, 1800, p. 252.), says of the same poet, "A monument waserected over his grave by Inigo Jones, which was destroyed with the oldchurch." Here also is an error. Inigo Jones's altar-tomb to the memoryof his friend is still to be seen in the churchyard, against the southwall of the church. The inscription, {373} which has been imperfectlyre-cut, is as follows:--  "Georgius Chapman        Poeta        MDCXX   Ignatius Jones,  Architectus Regius     ob honorem  bonarum Literarum      familiari     suo hoe mon     D.S.P.F.C."There is no proof that Inigo Jones's tomb now occupies its originalsite. The statement that Chapman was studied on the south side of thechurch is, I believe, mere conjecture.EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.       *       *       *       *       *MINOR NOTES_Shakspeare and George Herbert._--Your correspondent D.S. (Vol. ii., p.263.) has pointed out two illustrations to Shakspeare in GeorgeHerbert's poems. The _parallel passages_ between the two poets areexceedingly numerous. There are one or two which occur to me on theinstant:--  _The Church Porch_:  "In time of service, seal up both thine eyes,  And send them to thy heart; that, spying sin,  They may weep out the stains, by them did rise."  Cf. _Hamlet_, III. 4.:                "O Hamlet, speak no more;  Thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul,  And there I see such black and grained spots  As will not leave their tinct."       *       *       *       *       *  _Gratefulness_:  "Thou, that hast given so much to me,  Give one thing more, a grateful heart."  Cf. _Second Pt. Henry Sixth_, I. i.:                   "O Lord, that lends me life,  Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness;  For Thou hast given me, in this beauteous face,  A world of earthly blessings to my soul."       *       *       *       *       *  _The Answer_:                  "All the thoughts and ends  Which my fierce youth did bandy, fall and flow  Like leaves about me, or like summer friends,  Flies of estate and sunshine."  Cf. _Troil. and Cressida_, III. S.:                         "Men, like butterflies,  Show not their mealy wings but to the summer;  And not a man, for being simply man,  Hath any honour."  Also, _Third Pt. Henry Sixth_, II. 6.:  "The common people swarm like summer flies,  And whither fly the gnats, but to the sun?  And who shines now, but Henry's enemies?"S.A.Y._Old Dan Tucker._--In a little book entitled _A Thousand Facts in theHistories of Devon and Cornwall_, p. 50., occurs the following passage:    "The first governor [of Bermuda] was a Mr. Moore, who was    succeeded by Captain Daniel Tucker."Does this throw any light on the popular negro song--  "Out o' de way, old Dan Tucker," &c.?H.G.T._Lord John Townsend._--I have a copy of the _Rolliad_, with the names ofmost of the contributors, taken from a copy belonging to Dr. Lawrence,the editor of the volume, and author of many of the articles. In themargin of "Jekyll," lines 73. to 100. are stated to be "inserted byTickle;" and lines 156. to the end, as "altered and enlarged by Tickle:"and at the end is the following note:--    "There are two or three other lines in different parts of the    foregoing eclogue, which were altered, or inserted by    Tickle--chiefly in the connecting parts. The first draft (which    was wholly Lord John Townsend's) was a closer parody of Virgil's    18th eclogue; especially in the beginning and conclusion, in the    latter of which only Jekyll was introduced as 'the poet.'    "Tickle changed the plan, and made it what it is. The title (as    indeed the principal subject of the eclogue) was in consequence    altered from 'Lansdown' to 'Jekyll.' The poetry and satire are    certainly enriched by Tickle's touches; but I question whether    the humour was not more terse and classical, and the subject    more just, as the poem originally stood."--_L_.Probationary Odes No. XII. is by "Lord John Townsend."    "Three or four lines in the last stanza, and perhaps one or two    in some of the former, were inserted by Tickle."--_L._Dialogue between a certain Personage and his Minister (p. 442. of the22nd edition) is by "Ld. J.T."A new ballad, Billy Eden, is by "Ld. J.T., or Tickle."Ode to Sir Elijah Impey (p. 503.):    "Anonymous--I believe L'd. J.T."--_L._Ministerial undoubted Facts (p. 511.):    "Lord J. Townsend--I believe."--_L._W.C. TREVELYAN._Croker's Boswell_ (Edit. 1847, p. 721.).--Mr. Croker cannot discoverwhen a good deal of intercourse could have taken place between Dr.Johnson and the Earl of Shelburne, because "in 1765, when Johnsonengaged in politics with Hamilton, {374} Lord Shelburne was but twenty."In 1765 Lord Shelburne was twenty-eight. He was born in 1737; was inParliament in 1761; and a Privy Councillor in 1763.L.G.P._Misquotation--"He who runs may read_."--No such passage exists in theScriptures, though it is constantly quoted as from them. It is usuallythe accompaniment of expressions relative to the clearness of meaning ordirection, the supposititious allusion being to an inscription writtenin very large characters. The text in the prophet Habakkuk is thefollowing: "Write the vision and make it plain upon tables, that he mayrun that readeth it." (Ch. ii. 2.) Here, plainly, the meaning is, thatevery one reading the vision should be alarmed by it, and should flyfrom the impending calamity: and although this involves the notion oflegibility and clearness, that notion is the secondary, and not theprimary one, as those persons make it who misquote in the manner statedabove.MANLEIUS._Tindal's New Testament._--The following Bibliographical Note, by thelate Mr. Thomas Rodd, taken from a volume of curious early Latin andGerman Tracts, which will be sold by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson onFriday next, deserves a more permanent record than the Sale Catalogue.    "I consider the second tract of particular interest and    curiosity, as it elucidates an important point in English    literature, viz., the place (Worms) where Tindal printed the    edition of the New Testament commonly called the first, and    generally ascribed to the Antwerp Press.    "This book is printed in a Gothic letter, with woodcuts and    Initial Letters (in the year 1518).    "I have carefully examined every book printed at Antwerp, at the    period, that has fallen in my way; but in no one of them have I    found the same type or initial letters as are used therein.    "In the present tract I find the same form of type and woodcuts,    from the same school; and also, what is more remarkable, an    initial (D) letter, one of the same alphabet as a P used in the    Testament. These initial letters were always cut in alphabets,    and in no other books than these two have I discovered any of    the letters of this alphabet.    "The mistake has arisen from the circumstance of there having    been a piratical reprint of the book at Antwerp in 1525, but of    which no copy is known to exist."The following is the title of the tract referred to by Mr. Rodd:--    "_Eyn wolgeordent und nuetzlich buchlin, wie man Bergwerck suchen    un finden sol, von allerley Metall, mit seinen figuren, nach    gelegenheyt dess gebirgs artlich angezeygt mit enhangendon    Berchnamen den anfahanden_" and the colophon describes it as    "_Getruckt zu Wormbs bei Peter Schoerfern un volendet am funfften    tag Aprill_, M.D.XVIII."_The Term "Organ-blower._"--In an old document preserved among thearchives of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, is an entry relative tothe celebrated composer and organist HENRY PURCELL, in which he isstyled "our _organ-blower_." What is the meaning of this term? Itcertainly does not, in the present case, apply to the person whoseoffice it was to fill the organ with wind. Purcell, at the time theentry was made, was in the zenith of his fame, and "organist to theking." Possibly it may be the old term for an organist, as it will beremembered that in the fifteenth century the organ was performed upon by_blows_ from the fist.At the coronation of James II., and also at that of George I., two ofthe king's musicians walked in the procession, clad in scarlet mantles,playing each on a sackbut, and another, drest in a similar manner,playing on a double curtal, or bassoon. The "organ-_blower_" had also aplace in these two processions, having on him a short red coat, with abadge on his left breast, viz. a nightingale of silver, gilt, sitting ona sprig.In a weekly paper, entitled the _Westminster Journal_, Dec. 4. 1742, isa letter subscribed "Ralph Courtevil, _Organ-blower_, Essayist, andHistoriographer." This person was the organist of St. James's Church,Piccadilly, and the author of the _Gazetteer_, a paper written indefence of Sir Robert Walpole's administration. By the writers on theopposite side he was stigmatized with the name of "Court-evil."At the present time, as I am given to understand, the organist of St.Andrew's Church, Holborn, is styled in the vestry-books, the"_organ-blower_."EDWARD F. RIMBAULT."_Singular" and "Unique_."--The word _singular_, originally applied tothat of which there is no other, gradually came to mean extraordinaryonly, and "rather singular," "very singular indeed," and such likephrases, ceased to shock the ear. To supply the vacancy occasioned bythis corruption, the word _unique_ was introduced; which, I amhorror-struck to see, is beginning to follow its predecessor. TheVauxhall bills lately declared Vauxhall to be the "most _unique_ placeof amusement in the world." Can anything be done to check this ill-fatedword in its career? and, if not, what must we look to for a successor?M.       *       *       *       *       *QUERIES.EARLY POETRY, ETC., FIVE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES RESPECTING.1. Who was the author of--    "A Poeme on the King's most excellent maiesties happy progress    into Scotland and much desired returne. May, 1685. Imprinted at    London, MDCXXXIII." {375}It consists of ten leaves, exclusive of title-page, and is signed withthe initials J.R. No copy has been traced in any public or privatelibrary.2. How many leaves does _Nich. Breton's Fantastiques_ contain? I have acopy, apparently of a more recent date than the one alluded to in "NOTESAND QUERIES" (Vol. i., p. 410.), wanting the title, and probablyintroductory leaf; the text, however, is quite complete. Where can aperfect copy be found?3. There is in my possession a poetical collection, of which I can findno trace in any library public or private. It is dedicated to "EdmondLord Sheffield, Lord President of his Maiesties Council established inthe north parts," and the following is a copy of the title-page:--    "Northerne Poems congratulating the King's Maiesties most happy    and peaceable entrance to the crowne of England.               'Sorrowe was ouer night                But joy came in the morning.'                   'Sero, quamvis serio,                    Sat cito, si sat bene.'

Can any account be given of a sort of autobiography by an individualwhom Lord Orford sneers at in his _Anecdotes of Painting_; it isentitled:    "A Manifestation by Sir Balthazar Gerbier, K't. Job. xiii., ver.    18.; 'Behold now, I have ordered my cause, I know that I shall    bee justified.' London, Printed for the author, 1651." 12mo. 36    leaves and title.This very singular production does not appear to have been published,and I cannot trace it in any catalogue. It gives the author's descent,which is noble, and contains many interesting personal details of SirBalthazar, which cannot be found elsewhere.5. In the _Bibliographer's Manual_, by Lowndes, there occurs this entry:"Life and death of Major Clancie, the grandest cheat in this age," 1680,and the full catalogue of the Hon. Mr. Nassau is referred to. Can any ofyour readers state where a copy of this production may be found? A briefaccount of Clancie is contained in the _Memoirs of Gamesters andSharpers_, by Theophilus Lucas. He wrote, or there was written, underthis name, various other works not noticed by Lowndes. Can anyinformation be given as to the assumed or real author of these works?Lowndes also mentions _Clancie's Cheats, or the Life and Death of MajorClancie_, 1687.

If    each London or provincial journalist, each reader, and each    critic, who has an anecdote and a date, would give it publicity,    some future volume might be prepared from the combined supply,    much more complete than any to be fairly expected from a    comparatively unaided writer who ventures upon an almost    untrodden ground."The foregoing extract from the interesting volumes recently published byMr. Knight Hunt, under the unpretending title of _The Fourth Estate:Contributions towards a History of Newspapers, and of the Liberty of thePress_, has been very kindly recommended to our attention by _TheExaminer_. We gladly avail ourselves of the suggestion, and shall bepleased to record in our columns any facts of the nature referred to byMr. Hunt._Steele's Burial-place._--Sir Richard Steele died in the house now the"Ivy Bush" Inn, at Carmarthen, on the 1st of September, 1729.Where was he buried?Is there a monument or inscription to his memory in any church in ornear Carmarthen?LLEWELLYN._Socinian Boast._--In an allocution recently held by Dr. Pusey, to theLondon Church Union, in St. Martin's Hall, reported in _The Times_ ofOct. 17, the following passage occurs:    "The Socinian boast might be a warning to us against such    declarations. The Socinian pictured Calvin as carrying on the    protest against Rome more vigorously than Luther, himself than    Calvin:      "Tota jacet Babylon; destruxit tecta Lutherus,       Calvinus muros, sed fundamenta Socinus."Query, By what Socinian writer are these two hexameter verses used?L._Descent of Edward IV._--Professor Millar, in his _Historical View ofthe English Government_ (ii. 174.), in discussing the claim of EdwardIV. to the English throne, speaks of "a popular though probably agroundless tradition, that by his mother he was descended from HenryIII. by an elder brother of Edward I., who, on account of his personaldeformity, had been excluded from the succession to the crown." Wheremay I find this tradition? or where meet with any information on thesubject?S.A.Y. {376}_Viscount Castlecomer._--Sir Christopher Wanderforde, who succeeded poorStrafford as Lord Deputy of Ireland, in April, 1640, was created,between that date and his death, which occurred in December of the sameyear, Baron Mowbray and Musters, and Viscount Castlecomer. I should beglad to know the date of the patent of his creation, whether SirChristopher himself ever took up the title, and what became of the titleafterwards?S.A.Y._Judge Cradock, afterwards Newton._--MR ELLACOMBE (Vol. ii., p. 249.),in his notice of a monument in Yatton Church to "Judge Newton, _alias_Cradock," says, "the arms of Cradock are _Arg._ on chevron _az._ threegarbs _or_." Richard Cradock, he adds, "was the first of his family whotook the name of Newton." Does MR. ELLACOMBE mean that the above armswere those of the _Cradock family_, or that this Richard Cradock assumedthe coat as well as the name of _Newton_? The above was the bearing ofthe family of Newton, of East Newton, in the North Riding of York. Theeldest daughter and coheir of John Newton of East Newton was married toWilliam Thornton, which family thus became possessed of the estate ofEast Newton, and quartered the coat assigned by MR. ELLACOMBE toCradock. I should be glad to know the occasion on which Richard Cradockassumed the name and arms of Newton, as well as the connexion betweenthese Newtons and those settled at East Newton.S.A.Y._Totness Church._--In Totness Church, the N. angle of the chancel is cutoff in the lower part of the building, in order to allow an archedpassage from one side of the church to the other outside.The upper part of the building is supported by a very strong buttress orpier, leaving the diagonal passage between it and the internal wall. Canany one tell whether this was done merely to afford a gangway for wantof room outside?The graveyard has been recently enlarged in that direction, for all thetombstones beyond the line of the chancel appear to be of late date. Anold woman informed me, with an air of solemn authenticity, that thisarched passage was reserved as a place of deposit for the bodies ofpersons seized for debt, which lay there till they were redeemed.H.G.T._Meaning of "Harissers_."--It is customary in the county of Dorset,after carrying a field of corn, to leave behind a sheaf, to intimate tothe rest of the parish that the families of those who reaped the fieldare to have the first lease. After these gleaners have finished, thesheaf is removed, and other parties are admitted, called "barissers." Ihave been told that the real title is "arishers," from "arista." Ishould feel obliged if any of your correspondents could inform mewhether this name is known in any other county, and what is thederivation of the word.CLERICUS RUSTICUS._Ringelbergius--Drinking to Excess._--Ringelbergius, in the notes to histreatise _De Ratione Studii_, speaking of great drinkers, has thispassage:    "Eos qui magnos crateras haustu uno siccare possunt, qui sic    crassum illud et porosum corpus vino implent, ut per cutem humor    erumpat (nam tum se satis inquiunt potasse, cum, positis quinque    super mensam digitis, _quod ipse aliquando vidi_, totidem guttae    excidunt) laudant; hos viros esse et homines dicunt."He says that he himself _has seen this_. Does any reader of the "NOTESAND QUERIES" know of _any other author_ who says that he _has seen_ suchan exhibition? Or can Ringelbergius's assertion be confirmed from anysource?J.S.W.Stockwell, Oct. 15._Langue Pandras._--In the Life of Chaucer prefixed to the Aldine editionof his poetical works, there is published, for the first time, "a veryinteresting ballad," "addressed to him by Eustache Deschamps, acontemporary French poet," of which I beg leave to quote the firststanza, in order to give me the opportunity of inquiring the meaning of"_la langue Pandras_," in the ninth line:  "O Socrates, pleins de philosophie,  Seneque en moeurs et angles en pratique,  Ovides grans en ta poeterie,  Bries en parier, saiges en rethorique,  Aigles tres haulte qui par ta theorique  Enlumines le regne d'Eneas  L'isle aux geans, ceulx de Bruth, et qui as  Seme les fleurs et plante le rosier  Aux ignorans de _la langue Pandras_;  Grant translateur, noble Geoffroy Chaucier."May I ask, further, whether any particulars are known of thiscontemporary and admirer of Chaucer?I hope I shall not be deemed presumptuous if I add that I should havedoubted of the _genuineness_ of the poem quoted from, if Sir HarrisNicolas had not stated that it had been communicated to him by "ThomasWright, Esq., who received it from M. Paulin Paris," gentlemen in everyway qualified to decide on this point, and being sanctioned by them, Ihave no wish to appeal from their judgment.J.M.B._The Coptic Language._--I read in _The Times_ of this morning thefollowing:    "The Coptic is an uncultivated and formal tongue, with    monosyllabic roots and _rude inflexions, totally different_ from    the neighbouring languages of Syria and Arabia, _totally    opposite_ to the copious and polished Sanscrit."Do you think it worth while to try if some Coptic scholar among yourlearned correspondents can give us some clearer account of the realposition of that tongue, historically so interesting? {377} The point isthis, Is it _inflected_, or, does it employ _affixes_, or is itabsolutely without inflections and affixes?If the first, it cannot be "totally opposite" to the Sanscrit: if thesecond, it cannot be "totally different" from Syriac and Arabic: if thethird, it cannot have "rude inflections."J.E.Oxford, October 23. 1850._Cheshire Cat._--Will some of your correspondents explain the origin ofthe phrase, "grinning like a Cheshire cat?" The ingenious theory ofsomebody, I forget who, that Cheshire is a county palatine, and that thecats, when they think of it, are so tickled that they can't helpgrinning, is not _quite_ satisfactory toK.I.P.B.T._Mrs. Partington._--Where may I find the original Mrs. Partington, whosemaltreatment of the Queen's English maketh the newspapers so witty andmerry in these dull days?IGNORANS._Cognation of the Jews and Lacedemonians._--In the 12th chapter of the1st Book of Maccabees the letter of Jonathan, the High Priest, to theLacedemonians is given, in which he claims their amity. This is followedby a letter of Arcus, the Spartan king, in answer, and which containsthis assertion:    "It is found in writing that the Lacedemonians and Jews are    brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham."Have critics or ethnographers commented on this passage, which, to saythe least, is remarkable?As I am quoting from the Apocrypha, I may point out the anomaly of thesebooks being omitted in the great majority of our Bibles, whilst theirinstructive lessons are appointed to be read by the Church. Hundreds ofpersons who maintain the good custom of reading the proper lessons forthe day, are by this omission deprived, during the present season, oftwo chapters out of the four appointed.MANLEIUS.       *       *       *       *       *REPLIES.FAIRFAX'S TRANSLATION OF TASSO.On referring to my memoranda, I find that the copy of Fairfax'stranslation of the _Gerusalemme Liberata_ of Tasso, containing the_third_ variation of the first stanza, noticed in my last, has the _two_earliest pages reprinted, in order that the alteration might be morecomplete, and that the substitution, by pasting one stanza over another(as the book is usually met with) might not be detected. A copy with thereprinted leaf is, I apprehend, still in the library of the late WilliamWordsworth; and during the last twenty years I have never been able toprocure, or even to see, another with the same peculiarity.The course with the translator was, no doubt, this: he first printed hisbook as the stanza appears under the pasted slip; this version he sawreason to dislike, and then he had the slip printed with the variation,and pasted over some copies not yet issued. Again he was dissatisfied,and thinking he could improve, not only upon the first stanza, but upon"The Argument" by which it was preceded, he procured the two pages to bereprinted. It is, however, by no means clear to me that, after all,Fairfax liked his third experiment better than his two others: had heliked it better, we should, most probably, have found it in more copiesthan the single one I have pointed out.As your readers and contributors may wish to see "The Argument" andfirst stanza as they are given in Mr. Wordsworth's exemplar, Itranscribe them from my note-book, because, before I gave the book away,I took care to copy them exactly:--  THE ARGUMENT.  "God sends his angell to Tortosa downe:  Godfrey to counsell cals the Christian Peeres,  Where all the Lords and Princes of renowne  Chuse him their general: he straight appeeres  Mustring his royall hoast, and in that stowne  Sends them to Sion, and their hearts upcheeres.    The aged tyrant, Judaies land that guides,    In feare and trouble to resist provides.  "I sing the sacred armies and the knight  That Christ's great tombe enfranchis'd and set free.  Much wrought he by his witte, much by his might,  Much in that glorious conquest suffred hee:  Hell hindered him in vaine: in vaine to fight  Asia's and Affrick's people armed bee;    Heav'n favour'd him: his lords and knights misgone    Under his ensigne he reduc'd in one."I own that, to my ear and judgment, this is no improvement upon what wemay consider the author's second attempt, although I think that the slippasted over some (if not most) copies is better than the firstexperiment.THE HERMIT OF HOLYPORT.       *       *       *       *       *SMALL WORDS.I stand convicted by the critical acumen of your correspondent [Greek:Ph]. of having misquoted the line from Pope which heads my "note" at p.305. I entirely agree with [Greek: Ph]. that the utmost exactness isdesirable in such matters; and as, under such circumstances, I fear Ishould be ready enough to accuse others of "just enough of learning tomisquote," I have not a word to say in extenuation of my owncarelessness.But I entirely dispute [Greek: Ph].'s inference, and am unable to seethat the difference detracts in any substantial degree from theapplicability of my remarks, such as they were. {378}What does Pope's epithet "low" mean? Is it used for "vulgar" (as Ipresume [Greek: ph]. intends us to infer), or simply for "small, petty,of little size or value"?To me it appears impossible to read the line without seeing that Popehad in his mind the latter idea, that of poor, little, shabby,statureless monosyllables, as opposed to big, bouncing, brave, sonorouspolysyllables, such as Aristophanes called [Greek: hraemata hippokraemna].After all, however, it would do me very little damage to concede that heintended the meaning which [Greek: ph]. appears to attribute to theepithet "low", for _if he did_ mean "_vulgar_" words, it is evident thathe considered vulgarity in such matters inseparable from littleness, asthe "low" words must, if his line is not to lose its point altogether,have been _ten_ in number, that is, _every one a monosyllable_, a"small" word.Take it which way you will, the leading idea is that of "littleness;"moreover, there is no propriety in the word "creep" as applied to_merely vulgar_ words, while words petty in size may, with greatjustice, be said to "creep" in a "petty pace," requiring no less thanten steps to walk the length of a line.Pope was criticising compositions intended to pass as poetry of the bestkind. Will [Greek: ph]. point out in any existing poem of suchprofession and character, a single heroic line, consisting of _ten_words, _all_ which _ten_ words shall be "low" in the sense of "vulgar"?Can even the Muses of burlesque and slang furnish such an instance?Has not [Greek: ph]. suffered himself to be carried too far by hisexultation in being "down" (the last-named Muse has kindly supplied mewith the expression) upon a piece of verbal carelessness on the part ofK.I.P.B.T.?       *       *       *       *       *REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES._Concolinel_ (Vol. ii., pp. 217. 317.).--As _Calen O Custore me_, aftersorely puzzling the critics, was at length discovered to be an Irishair, or the burthen of an Irish song, is it not possible that theequally outlandish-looking "_Concolinel_" may be only a corruption of"_Coolin_", that "far-famed melody," as Mr. Bunting terms it in his_last_ collection of _The Ancient Music of Ireland_ (Dublin, 1840),where it may be found in a style "more Irish than that of the setshitherto published?" And truly it is a "sweet air," well fitted to "makepassionate _the_ sense of hearing," and melt the soul of even DonAdriano de Armado. The transmogrification of "_Coolin_" into"_Concolinel_", is hardly more strange than that of "_Cailin og astoremo_" [_chree_] (=my dear young girl, my [heart's] darling) into _Callinocastore me_.J.M.B.DR. RIMBAULT'S communication is very interesting, but not quitesatisfactory, not affording me any means of identifying the air. Itwould under most circumstances, have given me much pleasure to have lentDR. R. the MS., for I know no one so likely to make good use of it; butthe fact is, that without pretending to compete with DR. RIMBAULT in theknowledge of old music, I have also meditated a similar work on theballads and music of Shakspeare, and my chief source is the volume whichis said to contain the air of Concolinel. It will be some time before Ican execute the work alluded to, and I would prefer to see the Doctor'swork published first. Whichever first appears will most likelyanticipate much that is in the other, for, although Dr. R. says he hasspent "many years" on the subject, the accidental possession of severalMS. volumes has given me such singular advantages, I am unwilling tosurrender my project. I have the music to nearly twenty jigs, and twohave some of the words, which are curious.R._Wife of the Poet Bilderdijk--Schweickhardt the Artist_ (Vol. ii., pp.309. 349.).--JANUS DOUSA will find a very sufficient account ofSouthey's visit to the Dutch poet Bilderdijk, in vol. v. of the _Lifeand Correspondence of Southey_, now publishing by his son. To thespecial inquiry of JANUS DOUSA I can say nothing, but I would fain askwho was Katherine Wilhelmina Schweickhardt? I have in my possession aseries of eight etchings of studies of cattle, by H.W. Schweickhardt,published in 1786, and dedicated to Benjamin West. My father was veryintimate with Schweickhardt, and I think acted in some sort as hisexecutor. I do not know when be died but it must be thirty years since Iheard my father speak of his friend, who was then deceased, but whetherrecently or not I cannot say. I am rather disposed to think the eventwas comparatively a remote one: he left a widow. Was Mrs. Bilderdijk hisdaughter? The etchings are exceedingly clever and artistical; my copyhas the artist's name in his own handwriting. If I am not mistaken,Schweickhardt lived, when my father knew him, at Lambeth, then apicturesque suburb very unlike the "base, common, and popular" regionwhich it has since become. B.T. Pouncy, another clever artist of thatday, and a friend of my father's, resided there also. Pouncy publishedsome etchings which, although not professedly views of Lambeth, were inreality studies in that locality. When I was a boy I remember my fatherpointing out to me the Windmill, which was the subject of one of them.The Mrs. Bilderdijk who translated Roderick, was, according to Southey,the second wife of her husband. How did JANUS DOUSA learn that hermaiden name was Schweickhardt?G.J. DE WILDE. {379}_Noli me tangere_ (Vol. ii., p. 153.).--In addition to the list ofartists given by J.Z.P. (p. 253.), BR. will find that the subject hasalso been treated by--_Duccio_, in the Duomo at Siena._Taddeo Gaddi_, Rinnucini Chapel._Titian_, Mr. Roger's Collection._Rembrandt_, Queen's Gallery._Barroccio_. An altar piece which came to England with the Duke ofLucca's paintings, but I cannot say where it is now; it is well known bythe engraving from it of Raphael Morgen.B.N.C._Chimney Money_ (Vol. ii., pp. 120. 174. 269. 344.).--There is a churchat Northampton upon which is an inscription recording that the expenseof repairing it was defrayed by a grant of chimney money for, I believe,seven years, temp. Charles II.There is also a tombstone in Folkestone churchyard curiouslycommemorative of this tax. The inscription runs thus--  "In memory of  Rebecca Rogers,  who died August 29. 1688,  Aged 44 years.  "A house she hath, it's made of such good fashion,  The tenant ne'er shall pay for reparation,  Nor will her landlord ever raise her rent,  Or turn her out of doors for non-payment;  From chimney money, too, this cell is free,  To such a house, who would not tenant be."E.B. PRICE._Passage from Burke_ (Vol. ii., p. 359.).--Q.(2) will find the passagehe refers to in Prior's _Life of Burke_, vol. i. p. 39. It is extractedfrom a letter addressed by Burke to his old schoolfellow Matthew Smith,describing his first impressions on viewing Westminster Abbey, and otherobjects in the metropolis. Mr. Prior deserves our best thanks for givingus a letter so deeply interesting, and so characteristic of the giftedwriter, then barely of age.I.H.M.Bath._Nicholas Assheton's Journal_ (Vol. ii., pp. 331-2.).--If T.T. WILKINSONwill turn to pp. 45, 6, 7, of this very amusing journal, published bythe Chetham Society (vol. xiv., 1848), he will find some account of theRevels introduced before James the First at Hoghton Tower, in thecopious notes of the editor, the Rev. F.R. Raines, M.A., F.S.A.,elucidating the origin and history of these "coarse and indecorous"dances--the _Huckler_, _Tom Bedlo_, and the _Cowp Justice of Peace_.J.G.Manchester._Scotch Prisoners_, 1651 (Vol. ii., pp. 297. 350.).--Heath's _Chronicle_(p. 301. edit. 1676) briefly notices these unhappy men, "driven like aherd of swine, through Westminster to Tuthill Fields, and there _sold_to several merchants, and sent in to the Barbadoes."The most graphic account, however, is given in _Another Victory inLancashire_, &c., 4to. 1651, from which the parts possessing _local_interest were extracted by me in the _Civil War Tracts of Lancashire_,printed by the Chetham Society, with references to the _other matters_noticed, namely, Cromwell's entry into London, and the arrival of thefour thousand "_Scots, Highlands, or Redshanks_."These lay on Hampstead Heath, and were thence guarded through Highgate,and behind Islington to Kingsland and Mile End Green, receiving charityas they went, and having "a cart load or two of biskett behind them."Thence they proceeded by Aldgate, through Cheapside, Fleetstreet, andthe Strand, and on through Westminster.    "Many of them brought their wives and berns in with them, yet    were many of our scotified citizens so pitifull unto them, that    as they passed through the city, they made them, though    prisoners at mercy, masters of more money and good white bread    than some of them ever see in their lives. They marched this    night [Saturday, Sept. 13.] into Tuttle Fields. Some Irishmen    are among them, but most of them are habited after that    fashion."The contemporary journals in the British Museum would probably statesome epidemic which may have caused the mortality that followed.GEO. ORMERODSedbury Park, Clepstow._Long Friday_ (Vol. ii., p. 323.).--T.E.L.L. is not correct in hissupposition that "Long Friday" is the same as "Great Friday". In Danish,Good Friday is Langfredag; in Swedish, Laengfredag. I have alwaysunderstood the epithet had reference to the length of the services.COLL. ROYAL SOC._The Bradshaw Family_ (Vol. ii., p. 356.).--The president of thepretended high court of justice, a Cheshire man, had no connexion withHaigh Hall, in Lancashire. E.C.G. may satisfy himself by referring toMr. Ormerod's _History of Cheshire_ (vol. iii. p. 408.) for somevaluable information respecting the regicide and his family, and toWotton's _Baronetage_ (vol. iii. P. 2. p. 655.) for the descent of theloyal race of Bradshaigh.J.H.M.Bath._Julin, the drowned City_ (Vol. ii., pp. 230. 282.).--I am sorry I didnot state more clearly the inquiry respecting the fate of _Julin_, whichDR. BELL has been so good as to notice. This is partly the printer'sfault. I spoke of the _drowned_, not the _doomed_ city.The _drowning_ was what I desired some account of. "A flourishingemporium of commerce", extant {380} in 1072, and now surviving only intradition, and in "records" of ships wrecked on its "submerged ruins,"does not sink into the ocean without exciting wonder and pity. I knew ofthe tradition, and presumed there was some probability of the existenceof a legend (_legendum_, something to be _read_) describing acatastrophe that must have been widely heard of when it happened.This I conjectured might be found in Adam of Bremen; to whose mention ofJulin DR. BELL referred. But it seems that in his time the city wasstill existing, and flourishing ("urbs locuples").The "excidium civitatis," if the _Veneta_ of Helmold were Julin, musthave taken place, therefore, between 1072 and 1184, when the latteraccount was written. If Veneta was Julin, and "aquarum aestu absorpta,"there must, I suppose, be some account of this great calamity: and as Ihave seen in modern German works allusions to the drowning of the greatcity, and to the ruins still visible at times under water, I hoped tofind out the _where_ of its site, and the _when_ of its destruction--asgreat cities do not often sink into the waves, like exhalations, withoutsome report of their fate.V.Belgravia._Dodsley's Poems_ (Vol. ii., pp. 264. 343).--THE HERMIT OF HOLYPORT isinformed that the first edition of Dodsley's _Collection of Poems, byseveral Hands_, was published in 1748, 3 vols. 12mo. A fourth volume wasadded in 1749, containing pieces by Collins, Garrick, Lyttelton, Pope,Tickell, Thomson, &c. Those by Garrick and Lyttelton are anonymous. Thefour volumes were reprinted uniformly in 1755. The fifth and sixth wereadded in 1758.AMICUS CURIAE._Shunamitis Poema_ (Vol. ii., p. 326.).--The titlepage to the volume ofpoems inquired after by E.D. is as follows:    "Latin and English Poems, by a Gentleman of Trinity College,    Oxford.    'Nec lusisse pudet sed non incidere ludum.' HOR.    London: printed for L. Bathurst over against St. Dunstan's    Church, in Fleet Street, MDCCXLI."I know not the author; but I suspect either that the title of an Oxfordman was assumed by a Cantab, who might fairly wish not to be suspectedas the author of several of the poems; or that the author, having beenrusticated at Cambridge, vide at p. 84. the ode "Ad Thomam G." (whom Itake to be Thomas Gilbert of Peterhouse), transferred himself and hissomewhat licentious muse to Oxford.COLL. ROYAL SOC._Jeremy Taylor's Works_ (Vol. ii., p. 271.).--It seems desirable that anadvance should occasionally be made in _editing_, beyond the mereverification of authorities, in seeing, that is, whether the passagescited are _applicable_ to the point in hand, and properly apprehended.Bp. Taylor, in his _Liberty of Prophecying_, sect. vi., for instance,seems incorrect in stating that Leo I., bishop of Rome, _rejected_ theCouncil of Chalcedon; whereas his reproofs are directed againstAnatolias, bishop of Constantinople, an unwelcome aspirant toecclesiastical supremacy. (See _Concilia Studio Labbei_, tom. iv., col.844, &c.)A passage frown Jerome's _Epistle to Evangelus_ is often quoted in workson church government, as equalising, or nearly so, the office of bishopand presbyter; but the drift of the argument seems to be, to show thatthe _site_ of a bishop's see, be it great or small, important orotherwise, does not affect the episcopal _office_. Some readers willperhaps offer an opinion on these two questions.NOVUS._Ductor Dubitantium_.--The Judge alluded to by Jeremy Taylor in thepassage quoted by A.T. (Vol. ii., p. 325.), was Chief-JusticeRichardson; but the place where the outrage was committed was notLudlow, as stated by the eloquent divine, but Salisbury, as appears fromthe following marginal note in Dyer's _Reports_, p. 1886--a curiousspecimen of the legal phraseology of the period:--    "Richardson, C.J. de C.B. at Assizes at Salisbury in Summer 1631    fuit assault per Prisoner la condemne pur Felony; que puis son    condemnation ject un Brickbat a le dit Justice, que narrowly    mist. Et pur ceo immediately fuit Indictment drawn pur Noy    envers le Prisoner, et son dexter manus ampute et fixe al    Gibbet, sur que luy mesme immediatement hange in presence de    Court."EDWARD FOSS._Aerostation_ (Vol. ii., p. 317.).--The account published by Lunardi ofhis aerial voyage, alluded to by M., is, in the copy I have seen,entitled    "An Account of the First Aerial Voyage in Britain, in a series    of letters to his guardian, the Chevalier Gherardo Compagni,    written under the impressions of the various events that    affected the undertaking, by Vicent Lunardi, Esq., Secretary to    the Neapolitan Ambassador. 'A non esse nec fuisse non datur    argumentum ad non posse.' Second edition, London: printed for    the Author, and sold at the Panther; also by the Publisher J.    Bell, at the British Library, Strand, and at Mr. Molini's,    Woodstock Street, MDCCLXXXIV."The book contains printed copies of the depositions of witnesses whobeheld Lunardi's descent; and Mr. Baker, who, as a magistrate, tookthose depositions on oath, to establish what he thought so wonderful afact, erected on the spot where the balloon descended, in a field nearColliers End, in the parish of Standon, Herts, on the left of the highroad from London to Cambridge, a stone with the following inscription ona copper plate. It is still {381} legible, though somewhat defaced. Itis engraved in lines of unequal length, but to save your space I havenot adhered to those divisions.    "Let posterity know, and knowing, be astonished, that on the    fifteenth day of September, 1784, Vincent Lunardi of Lucca, in    Tuscany, the first aerial traveller in Britain, mounting from    the Artillery Ground in London, traversing the regions of the    air for two hours and fifteen minutes, in this spot revisited    the earth. On this rude monument for ages be recorded, that    wondrous enterprise, successfully achieved by the powers of    chemistry and the fortitude of man, that improvement in science,    which the great Author of all knowledge, patronising by His    providence the inventions of mankind, hath graciously permitted    to their benefit and His own eternal glory."COLL. ROYAL SOC._Gwyn's London and Westminster_ (Vol. ii., p. 297.).--A reference to Mr.Croker's _Boswell_ (last edit. 1847, p. 181.) may best satisfy Sec. N."Gwyn," says Mr. Croker, "proposed the _principle_, and in manyinstances the _details_, of the most important improvements which havebeen made in the metropolis in our day." Was this copied into the_Literary Gazette_?Mr. Sydney Smirke speaks favourably of Gwyn's favourite project, "theformation of a permanent Board or Commission for superintending andcontrolling the architectural embellishments of London." (_Suggestions_,&c., 8vo. 1834, p. 23.)J.H.M.Bath._Gwyn's London and Westminster_ (Vol. ii., p. 297.).--Under this head Sec.N. inquires, "Will you permit me, through your useful publication, tosolicit information of the number and date of the _Literary Gazette_which recalled public attention to this very remarkable fact:" namely,that stated by Mr. Thomas Hunt, in his _Exemplars of Tudor Architecture_(Longmans, 1830), to the effect that the _Literary Gazette_ had referredto the work entitled _London and Westminster Improved, by John Gwynn_.London, 1766, 4to., as having "pointed out almost all the designs forthe improvement of London which have been _devised_ by the civil andmilitary architects of the present day."In answer to the above, your correspondent will find two articles in the_Literary Gazette_ on this interesting subject; the first in No. 473.,Feb. 11. 1826, in which it is mentioned that _Mr. Gwynn_, foundinghimself in some degree upon the plan of _Sir C. Wren_, proposed    "To carry a street from Piccadilly through Coventry Street,    Sydney's Alley, Leicester Fields, Cranbourn Alley, and so to    Long Acre, Queen Street, and Lincolns Inn Fields, and thus    afford an easy access to Holborn; he also recommends _the    widening the Strand_ in its narrow parts," &c.I need hardly notice that by the removal of Exeter Change, thealterations near Charing Cross, and the more recent openings fromCoventry Street, along the line suggested by Mr. Gwynn, his designs havebeen so far carried out.The second paper in the _Literary Gazette_ was rather a long one, No.532., March 31. 1827. In it Mr. Gwynn's publication is analysed, and allthe leading particulars bearing on the "_old novelties_ of our modernimprovements" are brought to light.The whole is worth your reprinting, and at your service, if you willsend a copyist to the _Literary Gazette_ office to inspect the volumefor 1827.W.J., ED."_Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis_" (Vol. ii., p. 267.).--Thishexameter verse, which occurs in collections of Latin apophthegms, isnot to be found in this form, in any classical author. It has beenconverted into a single proverbial verse, from the following passage ofClaudian:  "Componitur orbis  Regis ad exemplum: nec sic inflictere sensus  Humanos edicta valent, ut vita regentis."  _De IV. Consul. Honor_., 299.L._St. Uncumber_ (Vol. ii., pp. 286. 342.).--Sir Thomas More details inhis _Dialoge_, with his usual quaintness, the attributes and merits ofmany saints, male and female, highly esteemed in his day, and, amongstothers, makes special mention of _St. Uncumber_, whose proper name, itappears, was _Wylgeforte_. Of these saints he says--    "Some serve for the eye onely, and some for a sore breast. _St.    Germayne_ onely for children, and yet will he not ones loke at    them, but if the mother bring with them a white lofe and a pot    of good ale: and yet is he wiser than _St. Wylgeforte_, for she,    good soule, is, as they say, served and contented with otys.    Whereof I cannot perceive the reason, but if it be bycause she    sholde provyde an horse for an evil housebonde to ride to the    Devyll upon; for that is the thing that she is so sought for, as    they say. In so much that women hath therefore chaunged her    name, and in stede of _St. Wylgeforte call her St. Uncumber,    bycause they reken that for a pecke of otys she will not fayle    to uncumber theym of theyr housbondys_."--(Quoted in Southey's    _Colloquies_, vol. i. p. 414.)_St. Wylgeforte_ is the female saint whom the Jesuit Sautel hascelebrated (in his _Annus Sacer Poeticus_) for her _beard_--a mark ofDivine favour bestowed upon her in answer to her prayers. She was abeautiful girl, who wished to lead a single life, and that she might besuffered to do so free from importunity, she prayed earnestly to berendered disagreeable to look upon, either by wrinkles, a hump on theback, or in any other efficacious way. Accordingly the beard was givenher; and it is satisfactory to know that it had the desired {382} effectto the fullest extent of her wishes. (Vid. Southey's _Omniana_, vol. ii.p. 54., where Sautel's lines are quoted.)J.M.B._West (James), President of Royal Society_ (Vol. ii., p. 289.).--T.S.D.states there "has certainly never been a president or even a secretaryof the Royal Society, of the name of James West." Your readers willremember that West is mentioned by Mr. Cunningham in his _London_, ashaving filled the former distinguished office: his statement, whichT.S.D. thus contradicts, is perfectly correct.Mr. West's election took place 30th of November, 1768, and he filled thechair until his death in July, 1772.J.H.M.[Mr. Cooper, of Cambridge, J.G.N., and other correspondents, have calledour attention to this oversight.]       *       *       *       *       *MISCELLANEOUS.NOTES OF BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.The idea of selecting from the _Spectator_ those papers in which therefined taste of Addison, working on the more imaginative genius ofSteele, has embodied that masterpiece of quiet thorough English humourwhich is exhibited in the portrait of Sir Roger de Coverley, is a mosthappy one,--so excellent indeed, and when done, it is so obviously wellthat it is done, that we can only wonder how it is, that, instead ofhaving now to thank Messrs. Longman for the quaintly and beautifully gotup volume entitled _Sir Roger de Coverley. By the Spectator. The Notesand Illustrations by Mr. Henry Wills: the Engravings by Thompson, fromDesigns by Fred. Tayler_,--as a literary novelty--such a selection hasnot been a stock book for the last century. Excellent, however, as isthe idea of the present volume, it has been as judiciously carried outas happily conceived. Mr. Tayler's designs exhibit a refined humourperfectly congenial with his subject, and free from that tendency tocaricature which is the prevailing fault of too many of the comicillustrators of the present day; while the pleasant gossiping notes ofMr. Wills furnish an abundance of chatty illustration of the scenes inwhich Sir Roger is placed, and the localities he visited, and so enableus to realise to ourselves, in every respect, Addison's admirablepicture of the worthy knight, "in his habit as he lived." May we addthat, on looking through these amusing notes, we were much gratified tofind Mr. Wills, in his illustration of the passage, "hisgreat-grandfather was inventor of that famous country-dance called afterhim," speaking of "the real sponsor to the joyous conclusion of everyball" as having "only been recently revealed, after the most vigilantresearch," since that revelation, with other information contained inthe same note, was procured by that gentleman through the medium of"NOTES AND QUERIES."Messrs.

What it aims atdoing is, to reach the learning which lies scattered not only throughoutevery part of our own country but all over the literary world, and tobring it all to bear upon the pursuits of the scholar; to enable, inshort, men of letters all over the world to give a helping hand to oneanother. To a certain extent, we have accomplished this end. Our lastnumber contains communications not only from all parts of themetropolis, and from almost every country in England, but also fromScotland, Ireland, Holland, and even from Demerara. This looks well. Itseems as if we were in a fair way to accomplish our design. But much yetremains to be done. We have recently been told of whole districts inEngland so benighted as never to have heard of "NOTES AND QUERIES;" andafter an interesting question has been discussed for weeks in ourcolumns, we are informed of some one who could have answered itimmediately if he had seen it. So long as this is the case the advantagewe may confer upon literature and literary men is necessarily imperfect.We do what we can to make known our {383} existence through thecustomary modes of announcement, and we gratefully acknowledge the kindassistance and encouragement we derive from our brethren of the publicpress; but we would respectfully solicit the assistance of our friendsupon this particular point.

H. F. CARY, M.A.PARADISECanto 1 - 33CANTO IHis glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,Pierces the universe, and in one partSheds more resplendence, elsewhere less.  In heav'n,That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,Witness of things, which to relate againSurpasseth power of him who comes from thence;For that, so near approaching its desireOur intellect is to such depth absorb'd,That memory cannot follow.  Nathless all,That in my thoughts I of that sacred realmCould store, shall now be matter of my song.Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,And make me such a vessel of thy worth,As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' browsSuffic'd me; henceforth there is need of bothFor my remaining enterprise Do thouEnter into my bosom, and there breatheSo, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'dForth from his limbs unsheath'd.  O power divine!If thou to me of shine impart so much,That of that happy realm the shadow'd formTrac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd treeCome to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;For to that honour thou, and my high themeWill fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire!To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreathCaesar or bard (more shame for human willsDeprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must springFrom the Pierian foliage, when one breastIs with such thirst inspir'd.  From a small sparkGreat flame hath risen: after me perchanceOthers with better voice may pray, and gainFrom the Cirrhaean city answer kind.Through diver passages, the world's bright lampRises to mortals, but through that which joinsFour circles with the threefold cross, in bestCourse, and in happiest constellation setHe comes, and to the worldly wax best givesIts temper and impression.  Morning there,Here eve was by almost such passage made;And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere,Blackness the other part; when to the leftI saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sunGazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken.As from the first a second beam is wontTo issue, and reflected upwards rise,E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'dInto my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyesUpon the sun.  Much is allowed us there,That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the placeMade for the dwelling of the human kindI suffer'd it not long, and yet so longThat I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,As iron that comes boiling from the fire.And suddenly upon the day appear'dA day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with kenFix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'dAt her aspect, such inwardly becameAs Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,That made him peer among the ocean gods;Words may not tell of that transhuman change:And therefore let the example serve, though weak,For those whom grace hath better proof in storeIf I were only what thou didst create,Then newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd,Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,Desired Spirit! with its harmonyTemper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blazeWith the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er madeA lake so broad.  The newness of the sound,And that great light, inflam'd me with desire,Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd,Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began:"With false imagination thou thyselfMak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st;For light'ning scap'd from its own proper placeNe'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd."Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt,By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,And said: "Already satisfied, I restFrom admiration deep, but now admireHow I above those lighter bodies rise."Whence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh,She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,As on her frenzied child a mother casts;Then thus began: "Among themselves all thingsHave order; and from hence the form, which makesThe universe resemble God.  In thisThe higher creatures see the printed stepsOf that eternal worth, which is the endWhither the line is drawn.  All natures lean,In this their order, diversely, some more,Some less approaching to their primal source.Thus they to different havens are mov'd onThrough the vast sea of being, and each oneWith instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course;This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,This the brute earth together knits, and binds.Nor only creatures, void of intellect,Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those,That have intelligence and love, are pierc'd.That Providence, who so well orders all,With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seatPredestin'd, we are carried by the forceOf that strong cord, that never looses dart,But at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true,That as ofttimes but ill accords the formTo the design of art, through sluggishnessOf unreplying matter, so this courseIs sometimes quitted by the creature, whoHath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,From its original impulse warp'd, to earth,By vicious fondness.  Thou no more admireThy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapseOf torrent downwards from a mountain's height.There would in thee for wonder be more cause,If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyselfBelow, like fire unmoving on the earth."So said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.CANTO IIAll ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,Eager to listen, on the advent'rous trackOf my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,Backward return with speed, and your own shoresRevisit, nor put out to open sea,Where losing me, perchance ye may remainBewilder'd in deep maze.  The way I passNe'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,Apollo guides me, and another NineTo my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.Ye other few, who have outstretch'd the neck.Timely for food of angels, on which hereThey live, yet never know satiety,Through the deep brine ye fearless may put outYour vessel, marking, well the furrow broadBefore you in the wave, that on both sidesEqual returns.  Those, glorious, who pass'd o'erTo Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,When they saw Jason following the plough.The increate perpetual thirst, that drawsToward the realm of God's own form, bore usSwift almost as the heaven ye behold.Beatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her,And in such space as on the notch a dartIs plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myselfArriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight.Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,Bespake me: "Gratefully direct thy mindTo God, through whom to this first star we come."Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smitWithin itself the ever-during pearlReceiv'd us, as the wave a ray of lightReceives, and rests unbroken.  If I thenWas of corporeal frame, and it transcendOur weaker thought, how one dimension thusAnother could endure, which needs must beIf body enter body, how much moreMust the desire inflame us to beholdThat essence, which discovers by what meansGod and our nature join'd!  There will be seenThat which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,But in itself intelligibly plain,E'en as the truth that man at first believes.I answered: "Lady! I with thoughts devout,Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world.But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spotsUpon this body, which below on earthGive rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?"She somewhat smil'd, then spake: "If mortals errIn their opinion, when the key of senseUnlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keenOught not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wingsOf reason to pursue the senses' flightAre short.  But what thy own thought is, declare."Then I: "What various here above appears,Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare."She then resum'd: "Thou certainly wilt seeIn falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if wellThou listen to the arguments, which IShall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displaysNumberless lights, the which in kind and sizeMay be remark'd of different aspects;If rare or dense of that were cause alone,One single virtue then would be in all,Alike distributed, or more, or less.Different virtues needs must be the fruitsOf formal principles, and these, save one,Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd.  Beside,If rarity were of that dusk the cause,Which thou inquirest, either in some partThat planet must throughout be void, nor fedWith its own matter; or, as bodies shareTheir fat and leanness, in like manner thisMust in its volume change the leaves.  The first,If it were true, had through the sun's eclipseBeen manifested, by transparencyOf light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.But this is not.  Therefore remains to seeThe other cause: and if the other fall,Erroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee.If not from side to side this rarityPass through, there needs must be a limit, whenceIts contrary no further lets it pass.And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,Must be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glassReflected, which behind it lead conceals.Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hueThan in the other part the ray is shown,By being thence refracted farther back.From this perplexity will free thee soonExperience, if thereof thou trial make,The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two removeFrom thee alike, and more remote the third.Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;Then turn'd toward them, cause behind thy backA light to stand, that on the three shall shine,And thus reflected come to thee from all.Though that beheld most distant do not stretchA space so ample, yet in brightness thouWill own it equaling the rest.  But now,As under snow the ground, if the warm raySmites it, remains dismantled of the hueAnd cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,Dismantled in thy mind, I will informWith light so lively, that the tremulous beamShall quiver where it falls.  Within the heaven,Where peace divine inhabits, circles roundA body, in whose virtue dies the beingOf all that it contains.  The following heaven,That hath so many lights, this being divides,Through  different essences, from it distinct,And yet contain'd within it.  The other orbsTheir separate distinctions variouslyDispose, for their own seed and produce apt.Thus do these organs of the world proceed,As thou beholdest now, from step to step,Their influences from above deriving,And thence transmitting downwards.  Mark me well,How through this passage to the truth I ford,The truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,May'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold."The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,As mallet by the workman's hand, must needsBy blessed movers be inspir'd.  This heaven,Made beauteous by so many luminaries,From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,Its image takes an impress as a seal:And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,Through members different, yet together form'd,In different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en soThe intellectual efficacy unfoldsIts goodness multiplied throughout the stars;On its own unity revolving still.Different virtue compact differentMakes with the precious body it enlivens,With which it knits, as life in you is knit.From its original nature full of joy,The virtue mingled through the body shines,As joy through pupil of the living eye.From hence proceeds, that which from light to lightSeems different, and not from dense or rare.This is the formal cause, that generatesProportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear."CANTO IIIThat sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'dHad of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect,By proof of right, and of the false reproof;And I, to own myself convinc'd and freeOf doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my headErect for speech.  But soon a sight appear'd,Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd,That of confession I no longer thought.As through translucent and smooth glass, or waveClear and unmov'd, and flowing not so deepAs that its bed is dark, the shape returnsSo faint of our impictur'd lineaments,That on white forehead set a pearl as strongComes to the eye: such saw I many a face,All stretch'd to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'dDelusion opposite to that, which rais'dBetween the man and fountain, amorous flame.Sudden, as I perceiv'd them, deeming theseReflected semblances to see of whomThey were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;Then turn'd them back, directed on the lightOf my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beamsFrom her celestial eyes.  "Wonder not thou,"She cry'd, "at this my smiling, when I seeThy childish judgment; since not yet on truthIt rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.True substances are these, which thou behold'st,Hither through failure of their vow exil'd.But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,That the true light, which fills them with desire,Permits not from its beams their feet to stray."Straight to the shadow which for converse seem'dMost earnest, I addressed me, and began,As one by over-eagerness perplex'd:"O spirit, born for joy! who in the raysOf life eternal, of that sweetness know'stThe flavour, which, not tasted, passes farAll apprehension, me it well would please,If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and thisYour station here." Whence she, with kindness prompt,And eyes glist'ning with smiles: "Our charity,To any wish by justice introduc'd,Bars not the door, no more than she above,Who would have all her court be like herself.I was a virgin sister in the earth;And if thy mind observe me well, this form,With such addition grac'd of loveliness,Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt knowPiccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,Here 'mid these other blessed also blest.Our hearts, whose high affections burn aloneWith pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,Admitted to his order dwell in joy.And this condition, which appears so low,Is for this cause assign'd us, that our vowsWere in some part neglected and made void."Whence I to her replied: "Something divineBeams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,From former knowledge quite transmuting you.Therefore to recollect was I so slow.But what thou sayst hath to my memoryGiven now such aid, that to retrace your formsIs easier.  Yet inform me, ye, who hereAre happy, long ye for a higher placeMore to behold, and more in love to dwell?"She with those other spirits gently smil'd,Then answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'dWith love's first flame to glow: "Brother! our willIs in composure settled by the powerOf charity, who makes us will aloneWhat we possess, and nought beyond desire;If we should wish to be exalted more,Then must our wishes jar with the high willOf him, who sets us here, which in these orbsThou wilt confess not possible, if hereTo be in charity must needs befall,And if her nature well thou contemplate.Rather it is inherent in this stateOf blessedness, to keep ourselves withinThe divine will, by which our wills with hisAre one.  So that as we from step to stepAre plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases all,E'en as our King, who in us plants his will;And in his will is our tranquillity;It is the mighty ocean, whither tendsWhatever it creates and nature makes."Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav'nIs Paradise, though with like gracious dewThe supreme virtue show'r not over all.But as it chances, if one sort of foodHath satiated, and of another stillThe appetite remains, that this is ask'd,And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did IIn word and motion, bent from her to learnWhat web it was, through which she had not drawnThe shuttle to its point.  She thus began:"Exalted worth and perfectness of lifeThe Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,By whose pure laws upon your nether earthThe robe and veil they wear, to that intent,That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleepWith their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.from the world, to follow her, when youngEscap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.God knows how after that my life was fram'd.This other splendid shape, which thou beholdstAt my right side, burning with all the lightOf this our orb, what of myself I tellMay to herself apply.  From her, like meA sister, with like violence were tornThe saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.E'en when she to the world again was broughtIn spite of her own will and better wont,Yet not for that the bosom's inward veilDid she renounce.  This is the luminaryOf mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,Which blew the second over Suabia's realm,That power produc'd, which was the third and last."She ceas'd from further talk, and then began"Ave Maria" singing, and with that songVanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave.Mine eye, that far as it was capable,Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:So that the sight sustain'd it not at first.Whence I to question her became less prompt.CANTO IVBetween two kinds of food, both equallyRemote and tempting, first a man might dieOf hunger, ere he one could freely choose.E'en so would stand a lamb between the mawOf two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:E'en so between two deer a dog would stand,Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praiseI to myself impute, by equal doubtsHeld in suspense, since of necessityIt happen'd.  Silent was I, yet desireWas painted in my looks; and thus I spakeMy wish more earnestly than language could.As Daniel, when the haughty king he freedFrom ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjustAnd violent; so look'd Beatrice then."Well I discern," she thus her words address'd,"How contrary desires each way constrain thee,So that thy anxious thought is in itselfBound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;What reason that another's violenceShould stint the measure of my fair desert?"Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem'd,Return.  These are the questions which thy willUrge equally; and therefore I the firstOf that will treat which hath the more of gall.Of seraphim he who is most ensky'd,Moses and Samuel, and either John,Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary's self,Have not in any other heav'n their seats,Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;Nor more or fewer years exist; but allMake the first circle beauteous, diverselyPartaking of sweet life, as more or lessAfflation of eternal bliss pervades them.Here were they shown thee, not that fate assignsThis for their sphere, but for a sign to theeOf that celestial furthest from the height.Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:Since from things sensible alone ye learnThat, which digested rightly after turnsTo intellectual.  For no other causeThe scripture, condescending graciouslyTo your perception, hands and feet to GodAttributes, nor so means: and holy churchDoth represent with human countenanceGabriel, and Michael, and him who madeTobias whole.  Unlike what here thou seest,The judgment of Timaeus, who affirmsEach soul restor'd to its particular star,Believing it to have been taken thence,When nature gave it to inform her mold:Since to appearance his intention isE'en what his words declare: or else to shunDerision, haply thus he hath disguis'dHis true opinion.  If his meaning be,That to the influencing of these orbs revertThe honour and the blame in human acts,Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.This principle, not understood aright,Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,And Mercury, and Mars.  That other doubt,Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it bringsNo peril of removing thee from me."That, to the eye of man, our justice seemsUnjust, is argument for faith, and notFor heretic declension.  To the endThis truth may stand more clearly in your view,I will content thee even to thy wish"If violence be, when that which suffers, noughtConsents to that which forceth, not for thisThese spirits stood exculpate.  For the will,That will not, still survives unquench'd, and dothAs nature doth in fire, tho' violenceWrest it a thousand times; for, if it yieldOr more or less, so far it follows force.And thus did these, whom they had power to seekThe hallow'd place again.  In them, had willBeen perfect, such as once upon the barsHeld Laurence firm, or wrought in ScaevolaTo his own hand remorseless, to the path,Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,When liberty return'd: but in too fewResolve so steadfast dwells.  And by these wordsIf duly weigh'd, that argument is void,Which oft might have perplex'd thee still.  But nowAnother question thwarts thee, which to solveMight try thy patience without better aid.I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,That blessed spirit may not lie; since nearThe source of primal truth it dwells for aye:And thou might'st after of Piccarda learnThat Constance held affection to the veil;So that she seems to contradict me here.Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for menTo do what they had gladly left undone,Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:E'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suitSlew his own mother, so made pitilessNot to lose pity.  On this point bethink thee,That force and will are blended in such wiseAs not to make the' offence excusable.Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,That inasmuch as there is fear of woeFrom non-compliance, it agrees.  Of willThus absolute Piccarda spake, and IOf th' other; so that both have truly said."Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well'dFrom forth the fountain of all truth; and suchThe rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I found."O thou of primal love the prime delight!Goddess!"  I straight reply'd, "whose lively wordsStill shed new heat and vigour through my soul!Affection fails me to requite thy graceWith equal sum of gratitude: be hisTo recompense, who sees and can reward thee.Well I discern, that by that truth aloneEnlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam,Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:Therein she resteth, e'en as in his lairThe wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound,And she hath power to reach it; else desireWere given to no end.  And thence doth doubtSpring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;And it is nature which from height to heightOn to the summit prompts us.  This invites,This doth assure me, lady, rev'rentlyTo ask thee of other truth, that yetIs dark to me.  I fain would know, if manBy other works well done may so supplyThe failure of his vows, that in your scaleThey lack not weight."  I spake; and on me straightBeatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparksOf love celestial in such copious stream,That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,I turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight.CANTO V"If beyond earthly wont, the flame of loveIllume me, so that I o'ercome thy powerOf vision, marvel not: but learn the causeIn that perfection of the sight, which soonAs apprehending, hasteneth on to reachThe good it apprehends.  I well discern,How in thine intellect already shinesThe light eternal, which to view aloneNe'er fails to kindle love; and if aught elseYour love seduces, 't is but that it showsSome ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam."This would'st thou know, if failure of the vowBy other service may be so supplied,As from self-question to assure the soul."Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,Began; and thus, as one who breaks not offDiscourse, continued in her saintly strain."Supreme of gifts, which God creating gaveOf his free bounty, sign most evidentOf goodness, and in his account most priz'd,Was liberty of will, the boon wherewithAll intellectual creatures, and them soleHe hath endow'd.  Hence now thou mayst inferOf what high worth the vow, which so is fram'dThat when man offers, God well-pleas'd accepts;For in the compact between God and him,This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,He makes the victim, and of his own act.What compensation therefore may he find?If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,By using well thou think'st to consecrate,Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed.Thus I resolve thee of the greater point."But forasmuch as holy church, hereinDispensing, seems to contradict the truthI have discover'd to thee, yet behoovesThou rest a little longer at the board,Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,Digested fitly to nutrition turn.Open thy mind to what I now unfold,And give it inward keeping.  Knowledge comesOf learning well retain'd, unfruitful else."This sacrifice in essence of two thingsConsisteth; one is that, whereof 't is made,The covenant the other.  For the last,It ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and henceI spake erewhile so strictly of its force.For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,Though leave were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to changeThe offering, still to offer.  Th' other part,The matter and the substance of the vow,May well be such, to that without offenceIt may for other substance be exchang'd.But at his own discretion none may shiftThe burden on his shoulders, unreleas'dBy either key, the yellow and the white.Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,If the last bond be not within the newIncluded, as the quatre in the six.No satisfaction therefore can be paidFor what so precious in the balance weighs,That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.Take then no vow at random: ta'en, with faithPreserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,Blindly to execute a rash resolve,Whom better it had suited to exclaim,'I have done ill,' than to redeem his pledgeBy doing worse or, not unlike to himIn folly, that great leader of the Greeks:Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'dHer virgin beauty, and hath since made mournBoth wise and simple, even all, who hearOf so fell sacrifice.  Be ye more staid,O Christians, not, like feather, by each windRemovable: nor think to cleanse ourselvesIn every water.  Either testament,The old and new, is yours: and for your guideThe shepherd of the church let this sufficeTo save you.  When by evil lust entic'd,Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,Hold you in mock'ry.  Be not, as the lamb,That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother's milk,To dally with itself in idle play."Such were the words that Beatrice spake:These ended, to that region, where the worldIs liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd.Though mainly prompt new question to propose,Her silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb.And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,Leapeth unto its mark; so on we spedInto the second realm.  There I beheldThe dame, so joyous enter, that the orbGrew brighter at her smiles; and, if the starWere mov'd to gladness, what then was my cheer,Whom nature hath made apt for every change!As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,If aught approach them from without, do drawTowards it, deeming it their food; so drewFull more than thousand splendours towards us,And in each one was heard: "Lo! one arriv'dTo multiply our loves!" and as each cameThe shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,Witness'd augmented joy.  Here, reader! think,If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;And thou shalt see what vehement desirePossess'd me, as soon as these had met my view,To know their state.  "O born in happy hour!Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy closeOf fleshly warfare, to behold the thronesOf that eternal triumph, know to usThe light communicated, which through heavenExpatiates without bound.  Therefore, if aughtThou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill."Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;And Beatrice next: "Say on; and trustAs unto gods!"--"How in the light supremeThou harbour'st, and from thence the virtue bring'st,That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,I mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lotThis sphere assign'd, that oft from mortal kenIs veil'd by others' beams."  I said, and turn'dToward the lustre, that with greeting, kindErewhile had hail'd me.  Forthwith brighter farThan erst, it wax'd: and, as himself the sunHides through excess of light, when his warm gazeHath on the mantle of thick vapours prey'd;Within its proper ray the saintly shapeWas, through increase of gladness, thus conceal'd;And, shrouded so in splendour answer'd me,E'en as the tenour of my song declares.CANTO VI"After that Constantine the eagle turn'dAgainst the motions of the heav'n, that roll'dConsenting with its course, when he of yore,Lavinia's spouse, was leader of the flight,A hundred years twice told and more, his seatAt Europe's extreme point, the bird of JoveHeld, near the mountains, whence he issued first.There, under shadow of his sacred plumesSwaying the world, till through successive handsTo mine he came devolv'd.  Caesar I was,And am Justinian; destin'd by the willOf that prime love, whose influence I feel,From vain excess to clear th' encumber'd laws.Or ere that work engag'd me, I did holdChrist's nature merely human, with such faithContented.  But the blessed Agapete,Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voiceTo the true faith recall'd me.  I believ'dHis words: and what he taught, now plainly see,As thou in every contradiction seestThe true and false oppos'd.  Soon as my feetWere to the church reclaim'd, to my great task,By inspiration of God's grace impell'd,I gave me wholly, and consign'd mine armsTo Belisarius, with whom heaven's right handWas link'd in such conjointment, 't was a signThat I should rest.  To thy first question thusI shape mine answer, which were ended here,But that its tendency doth prompt perforceTo some addition; that thou well, mayst markWhat reason on each side they have to plead,By whom that holiest banner is withstood,Both who pretend its power and who oppose."Beginning from that hour, when Pallas diedTo give it rule, behold the valorous deedsHave made it worthy reverence.  Not unknownTo thee, how for three hundred years and moreIt dwelt in Alba, up to those fell listsWhere for its sake were met the rival three;Nor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev'dDown to the Sabines' wrong to Lucrece' woe,With its sev'n kings conqu'ring the nation round;Nor all it wrought, by Roman worthies home'Gainst Brennus and th' Epirot prince, and hostsOf single chiefs, or states in league combin'dOf social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,And Quintius nam'd of his neglected locks,The Decii, and the Fabii hence acquir'dTheir fame, which I with duteous zeal embalm.By it the pride of Arab hordes was quell'd,When they led on by Hannibal o'erpass'dThe Alpine rocks, whence glide thy currents, Po!Beneath its guidance, in their prime of daysScipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,Under whose summit thou didst see the light,Rued its stern bearing.  After, near the hour,When heav'n was minded that o'er all the worldHis own deep calm should brood, to Caesar's handDid Rome consign it; and what then it wroughtFrom Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere's flood,Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fillsThe torrent Rhone.  What after that it wrought,When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap'dThe Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,That tongue nor pen may follow it.  Tow'rds SpainIt wheel'd its bands, then tow'rd Dyrrachium smote,And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,E'en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;Its native shores Antandros, and the streamsOf Simois revisited, and thereWhere Hector lies; then ill for PtolemyHis pennons shook again; lightning thence fellOn Juba; and the next upon your west,At sound of the Pompeian trump, return'd."What following and in its next bearer's gripeIt wrought, is now by Cassius and BrutusBark'd off in hell, and by Perugia's sonsAnd Modena's was mourn'd.  Hence weepeth stillSad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,Took from the adder black and sudden death.With him it ran e'en to the Red Sea coast;With him compos'd the world to such a peace,That of his temple Janus barr'd the door."But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,And was appointed to perform thereafter,Throughout the mortal kingdom which it sway'd,Falls in appearance dwindled and obscur'd,If one with steady eye and perfect thoughtOn the third Caesar look; for to his hands,The living Justice, in whose breath I move,Committed glory, e'en into his hands,To execute the vengeance of its wrath."Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.After with Titus it was sent to wreakVengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,And, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,Did gore the bosom of the holy church,Under its wings victorious, CharlemagneSped to her rescue.  Judge then for thyselfOf those, whom I erewhile accus'd to thee,What they are, and how grievous their offending,Who are the cause of all your ills.  The oneAgainst the universal ensign rearsThe yellow lilies, and with partial aimThat to himself the other arrogates:So that 't is hard to see which more offends.Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your artsBeneath another standard: ill is thisFollow'd of him, who severs it and justice:And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown'd CharlesAssail it, but those talons hold in dread,Which from a lion of more lofty portHave rent the easing.  Many a time ere nowThe sons have for the sire's transgression wail'd;Nor let him trust the fond belief, that heav'nWill truck its armour for his lilied shield."This little star is furnish'd with good spirits,Whose mortal lives were busied to that end,That honour and renown might wait on them:And, when desires thus err in their intention,True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.But it is part of our delight, to measureOur wages with the merit; and admireThe close proportion.  Hence doth heav'nly justiceTemper so evenly affection in us,It ne'er can warp to any wrongfulness.Of diverse voices is sweet music made:So in our life the different degreesRender sweet harmony among these wheels."Within the pearl, that now encloseth us,Shines Romeo's light, whose goodly deed and fairMet ill acceptance.  But the Provencals,That were his foes, have little cause for mirth.Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrongOf other's worth.  Four daughters were there bornTo Raymond Berenger, and every oneBecame a queen; and this for him did Romeo,Though of mean state and from a foreign land.Yet envious tongues incited him to askA reckoning of that just one, who return'dTwelve fold to him for ten.  Aged and poorHe parted thence: and if the world did knowThe heart he had, begging his life by morsels,'T would deem the praise, it yields him, scantly dealt."CANTO VII"Hosanna Sanctus Deus SabaothSuperillustrans claritate tuaFelices ignes horum malahoth!"Thus chanting saw I turn that substance brightWith fourfold lustre to its orb again,Revolving; and the rest unto their danceWith it mov'd also; and like swiftest sparks,In sudden distance from my sight were veil'd.Me doubt possess'd, and "Speak," it whisper'd me,"Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quenchThy thirst with drops of sweetness."  Yet blank awe,Which lords it o'er me, even at the soundOf Beatrice's name, did bow me downAs one in slumber held.  Not long that moodBeatrice suffer'd: she, with such a smile,As might have made one blest amid the flames,Beaming upon me, thus her words began:"Thou in thy thought art pond'ring (as I deem),And what I deem is truth how just revengeCould be with justice punish'd: from which doubtI soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;For they of weighty matter shall possess thee."That man, who was unborn, himself condemn'd,And, in himself, all, who since him have liv'd,His offspring: whence, below, the human kindLay sick in grievous error many an age;Until it pleas'd the Word of God to comeAmongst them down, to his own person joiningThe nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,By the mere act of his eternal love.Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.The nature with its Maker thus conjoin'd,Created first was blameless, pure and good;But through itself alone was driven forthFrom Paradise, because it had eschew'dThe way of truth and life, to evil turn'd.Ne'er then was penalty so just as thatInflicted by the cross, if thou regardThe nature in assumption doom'd: ne'er wrongSo great, in reference to him, who tookSuch nature on him, and endur'd the doom.God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:So different effects flow'd from one act,And heav'n was open'd, though the earth did quake.Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hearThat a just vengeance was by righteous courtJustly reveng'd.  But yet I see thy mindBy thought on thought arising sore perplex'd,And with how vehement desire it asksSolution of the maze.  What I have heard,Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this wayFor our redemption chose, eludes my search."Brother! no eye of man not perfected,Nor fully ripen'd in the flame of love,May fathom this decree.  It is a mark,In sooth, much aim'd at, and but little kenn'd:And I will therefore show thee why such wayWas worthiest.  The celestial love, that spumeAll envying in its bounty, in itselfWith such effulgence blazeth, as sends forthAll beauteous things eternal.  What distilsImmediate thence, no end of being knows,Bearing its seal immutably impress'd.Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,Free wholly, uncontrollable by powerOf each thing new: by such conformityMore grateful to its author, whose bright beams,Though all partake their shining, yet in thoseAre liveliest, which resemble him the most.These tokens of pre-eminence on manLargely bestow'd, if any of them fail,He needs must forfeit his nobility,No longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlikeTo the chief good; for that its light in himIs darken'd.  And to dignity thus lostIs no return; unless, where guilt makes void,He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.Your nature, which entirely in its seedTrangress'd, from these distinctions fell, no lessThan from its state in Paradise; nor meansFound of recovery (search all methods outAs strickly as thou may) save one of these,The only fords were left through which to wade,Either that God had of his courtesyReleas'd him merely, or else man himselfFor his own folly by himself aton'd."Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,On th' everlasting counsel, and explore,Instructed by my words, the dread abyss."Man in himself had ever lack'd the meansOf satisfaction, for he could not stoopObeying, in humility so low,As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:And for this reason he had vainly triedOut of his own sufficiency to payThe rigid satisfaction.  Then behoovedThat God should by his own ways lead him backUnto the life, from whence he fell, restor'd:By both his ways, I mean, or one alone.But since the deed is ever priz'd the more,The more the doer's good intent appears,Goodness celestial, whose broad signatureIs on the universe, of all its waysTo raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,Either for him who gave or who receiv'dBetween the last night and the primal day,Was or can be.  For God more bounty show'd.Giving himself to make man capableOf his return to life, than had the termsBeen mere and unconditional release.And for his justice, every method elseWere all too scant, had not the Son of GodHumbled himself to put on mortal flesh."Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remainsI somewhat further to thy view unfold.That thou mayst see as clearly as myself."I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,The earth and water, and all things of themCompounded, to corruption turn, and soonDissolve.  Yet these were also things create,Because, if what were told me, had been trueThey from corruption had been therefore free."The angels, O my brother! and this climeWherein thou art, impassible and pure,I call created, as indeed they areIn their whole being.  But the elements,Which thou hast nam'd, and what of them is made,Are by created virtue' inform'd: createTheir substance, and create the' informing virtueIn these bright stars, that round them circling moveThe soul of every brute and of each plant,The ray and motion of the sacred lights,With complex potency attract and turn.But this our life the' eternal good inspiresImmediate, and enamours of itself;So that our wishes rest for ever here."And hence thou mayst by inference concludeOur resurrection certain, if thy mindConsider how the human flesh was fram'd,When both our parents at the first were made."CANTO VIIIThe world was in its day of peril darkWont to believe the dotage of fond loveFrom the fair Cyprian deity, who rollsIn her third epicycle, shed on menBy stream of potent radiance: therefore theyOf elder time, in their old error blind,Not her alone with sacrifice ador'dAnd invocation, but like honours paidTo Cupid and Dione, deem'd of themHer mother, and her son, him whom they feign'dTo sit in Dido's bosom: and from her,Whom I have sung preluding, borrow'd theyThe appellation of that star, which views,Now obvious and now averse, the sun.I was not ware that I was wafted upInto  its orb; but the new lovelinessThat grac'd my lady, gave me ample proofThat we had entered there.  And as in flameA sparkle is distinct, or voice in voiceDiscern'd, when one its even tenour keeps,The other comes and goes; so in that lightI other luminaries saw, that cours'dIn circling motion, rapid more or less,As their eternal phases each impels.Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,Whether invisible to eye or no,Descended with such speed, it had not seem'dTo linger in dull tardiness, compar'dTo those celestial lights, that tow'rds us came,Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,Conducted by the lofty seraphim.And after them, who in the van appear'd,Such an hosanna sounded, as hath leftDesire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hearRenew'd the strain.  Then parting from the restOne near us drew, and sole began: "We allAre ready at thy pleasure, well dispos'dTo do thee gentle service.  We are they,To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing'O ye! whose intellectual ministryMoves the third heaven!' and in one orb we roll,One motion, one impulse, with those who rulePrincedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,That to please thee 't will be as sweet to rest."After mine eyes had with meek reverenceSought the celestial guide, and were by herAssur'd, they turn'd again unto the lightWho had so largely promis'd, and with voiceThat bare the lively pressure of my zeal,"Tell who ye are," I cried.  Forthwith it grewIn size and splendour, through augmented joy;And thus it answer'd: "A short date belowThe world possess'd me.  Had the time been more,Much evil, that will come, had never chanc'd.My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shineAround, and shroud me, as an animalIn its own silk enswath'd.  Thou lov'dst me well,And had'st good cause; for had my sojourningBeen longer on the earth, the love I bare theeHad put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank,That Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves."In me its lord expected, and that hornOf fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd,From where the Trento disembogues his waves,With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.Already on my temples beam'd the crown,Which gave me sov'reignty over the landBy Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyondThe limits of his German shores.  The realm,Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloudBituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did lookTo have its scepter wielded by a raceOf monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;had not ill lording which doth spirit upThe people ever, in Palermo rais'dThe shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long.Had but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much,He had been warier that the greedy wantOf Catalonia might not work his bale.And truly need there is, that he forecast,Or other for him, lest more freight be laidOn his already over-laden bark.Nature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift,Would ask the  guard of braver arms, than suchAs only care to have their coffers fill'd.""My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy wordsInfuse into me, mighty as it is,To think my gladness manifest to thee,As to myself, who own it, when thou lookstInto the source and limit of all good,There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,Thence priz'd of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me.Now make intelligent, clearing the doubtThy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown."I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:"If I have power to show one truth, soon thatShall face thee, which thy questioning declaresBehind thee now conceal'd.  The Good, that guidesAnd blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,Ordains its providence to be the virtueIn these great bodies: nor th' all perfect MindUpholds their nature merely, but in themTheir energy to save: for nought, that liesWithin the range of that unerring bow,But is as level with the destin'd aim,As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd.Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,Would their effect so work, it would not beArt, but destruction; and this may not chance,If th' intellectual powers, that move these stars,Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?"To whom I thus: "It is enough: no fear,I see, lest nature in her part should tire."He straight rejoin'd: "Say, were it worse for man,If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?""Yea," answer'd I; "nor here a reason needs.""And may that be, if different estatesGrow not of different duties in your life?Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no."'Thus did he come, deducing to this point,And then concluded: "For this cause behooves,The roots, from whence your operations come,Must differ.  Therefore one is Solon born;Another, Xerxes; and MelchisidecA third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyageCost him his son.  In her circuitous course,Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns'Twixt one or other household.  Hence befallsThat Esau is so wide of Jacob: henceQuirinus of so base a father springs,He dates from Mars his lineage.  Were it notThat providence celestial overrul'd,Nature, in generation, must the pathTrac'd by the generator, still pursueUnswervingly.  Thus place I in thy sightThat, which was late behind thee.  But, in signOf more affection for thee, 't is my willThou wear this corollary.  Nature everFinding discordant fortune, like all seedOut of its proper climate, thrives but ill.And were the world below content to markAnd work on the foundation nature lays,It would not lack supply of excellence.But ye perversely to religion strainHim, who was born to gird on him the sword,And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths."CANTO IXAfter solution of my doubt, thy Charles,O fair Clemenza, of the treachery spakeThat must befall his seed: but, "Tell it not,"Said he, "and let the destin'd years come round."Nor may I tell thee more, save that the meedOf sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your wrongs.And now the visage of that saintly lightWas to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,As to the good, whose plenitude of blissSufficeth all.  O ye misguided souls!Infatuate, who from such a good estrangeYour hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,Alas for you!--And lo! toward me, next,Another of those splendent forms approach'd,That, by its outward bright'ning, testifiedThe will it had to pleasure me.  The eyesOf Beatrice, resting, as before,Firmly upon me, manifested forthApproval of my wish.  "And O," I cried,"Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd;And prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughtsI can reflect on thee."  Thereat the light,That yet was new to me, from the recess,Where it before was singing, thus began,As one who joys in kindness: "In that partOf the deprav'd Italian land, which liesBetween Rialto, and the fountain-springsOf Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,But to no lofty eminence, a hill,From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,That sorely sheet the region.  From one rootI and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:And here I glitter, for that by its lightThis star o'ercame me.  Yet I naught repine,Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive."This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,And not to perish, ere these hundred yearsFive times absolve their round.  Consider thou,If to excel be worthy man's endeavour,When such life may attend the first.  Yet theyCare not for this, the crowd that now are girtBy Adice and Tagliamento, stillImpenitent, tho' scourg'd.  The hour is near,When for their stubbornness at Padua's marshThe water shall be chang'd, that laves VicenaAnd where Cagnano meets with Sile, oneLords it, and bears his head aloft, for whomThe web is now a-warping.  Feltro tooShall sorrow for its godless shepherd's fault,Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,Was Malta's bar unclos'd.  Too large should beThe skillet, that would hold Ferrara's blood,And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suitThe country's custom.  We descry above,Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to usReflected shine the judgments of our God:Whence these our sayings we avouch for good."She ended, and appear'd on other thoughtsIntent, re-ent'ring on the wheel she lateHad left.  That other joyance meanwhile wax'dA thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,For, in that upper clime, effulgence comesOf gladness, as here laughter: and below,As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade."God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,"Said I, "blest Spirit!  Therefore will of hisCannot to thee be dark.  Why then delaysThy voice to satisfy my wish untold,That voice which joins the inexpressive song,Pastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?I would not wait thy asking, wert thou knownTo me, as thoroughly I to thee am known."He forthwith answ'ring, thus his words began:"The valley' of waters, widest next to thatWhich doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,Between discordant shores, against the sunInward so far, it makes meridian there,Where was before th' horizon.  Of that valeDwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's streamAnd Macra's, that divides with passage briefGenoan bounds from Tuscan.  East and westAre nearly one to Begga and my land,Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:And I did bear impression of this heav'n,That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flameGlow'd Belus' daughter, injuring alikeSichaeus and Creusa, than did I,Long as it suited the unripen'd downThat fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,That was beguiled of Demophoon;Nor Jove's son, when the charms of IoleWere shrin'd within his heart.  And yet there hidesNo sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),But for the virtue, whose o'erruling swayAnd providence have wrought thus quaintly.  HereThe skill is look'd into, that fashionethWith such effectual working, and the goodDiscern'd, accruing to this upper worldFrom that below.  But fully to contentThy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,Demands my further parle.  Inquire thou wouldst,Who of this light is denizen, that hereBeside me sparkles, as the sun-beam dothOn the clear wave.  Know then, the soul of RahabIs in that gladsome harbour, to our tribeUnited, and the foremost rank assign'd.He to that heav'n, at which the shadow endsOf your sublunar world, was taken up,First, in Christ's triumph, of all souls redeem'd:For well behoov'd, that, in some part of heav'n,She should remain a trophy, to declareThe mighty contest won with either palm;For that she favour'd first the high exploitOf Joshua on the holy land, whereofThe Pope recks little now.  Thy city, plantOf him, that on his Maker turn'd the back,And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,Engenders and expands the cursed flower,That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,Turning the shepherd to a wolf.  For this,The gospel and great teachers laid aside,The decretals, as their stuft margins show,Are the sole study.  Pope and Cardinals,Intent on these, ne'er journey but in thoughtTo Nazareth, where Gabriel op'd his wings.Yet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,And other most selected parts of Rome,That were the grave of Peter's soldiery,Shall be deliver'd from the adult'rous bond."CANTO XLooking into his first-born with the love,Which breathes from both eternal, the first MightIneffable, whence eye or mindCan roam, hath in such order all dispos'd,As none may see and fail to enjoy.  Raise, then,O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,Thy ken directed to the point, whereatOne motion strikes on th' other.  There beginThy wonder of the mighty Architect,Who loves his work so inwardly, his eyeDoth ever watch it.  See, how thence obliqueBrancheth the circle, where the planets rollTo pour their wished influence on the world;Whose path not bending thus, in heav'n aboveMuch virtue would be lost, and here on earth,All power well nigh extinct: or, from directWere its departure distant more or less,I' th' universal order, great defectMust, both in heav'n and here beneath, ensue.Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and museAnticipative of the feast to come;So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.Lo! I have set before thee, for thyselfFeed now: the matter I indite, henceforthDemands entire my thought.  Join'd with the part,Which late we told of, the great ministerOf nature, that upon the world imprintsThe virtue of the heaven, and doles outTime for us with his beam, went circling onAlong the spires, where each hour sooner comes;And I was with him, weetless of ascent,As one, who till arriv'd, weets not his coming.For Beatrice, she who passeth onSo suddenly from good to better, timeCounts not the act, oh then how great must needsHave been her brightness!  What she was i' th' sun(Where I had enter'd), not through change of hue,But light transparent--did I summon upGenius, art, practice--I might not so speak,It should be e'er imagin'd: yet believ'dIt may be, and the sight be justly crav'd.And if our fantasy fail of such height,What marvel, since no eye above the sunHath ever travel'd?  Such are they dwell here,Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;And holds them still enraptur'd with the view.And thus to me Beatrice: "Thank, oh thank,The Sun of angels, him, who by his graceTo this perceptible hath lifted thee."Never was heart in such devotion bound,And with complacency so absoluteDispos'd to render up itself to God,As mine was at those words: and so entireThe love for Him, that held me, it eclips'dBeatrice in oblivion.  Naught displeas'dWas she, but smil'd thereat so joyously,That of her laughing eyes the radiance brakeAnd scatter'd my collected mind abroad.Then saw I a bright band, in livelinessSurpassing, who themselves did make the crown,And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,Than in their visage beaming.  Cinctur'd thus,Sometime Latona's daughter we behold,When the impregnate air retains the thread,That weaves her zone.  In the celestial court,Whence I return, are many jewels found,So dear and beautiful, they cannot brookTransporting from that realm: and of these lightsSuch was the song.  Who doth not prune his wingTo soar up thither, let him look from thenceFor tidings from the dumb.  When, singing thus,Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,As nearest stars around the fixed pole,Then seem'd they like to ladies, from the danceNot ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,List'ning, till they have caught the strain anew:Suspended so they stood: and, from within,Thus heard I one, who spake: "Since with its beamThe grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,That after doth increase by loving, shinesSo multiplied in thee, it leads thee upAlong this ladder, down whose hallow'd stepsNone e'er descend, and mount them not again,Who from his phial should refuse thee wineTo slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,Than water flowing not unto the sea.Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloomIn the bright garland, which, admiring, girdsThis fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav'n.I then was of the lambs, that DominicLeads, for his saintly flock, along the way,Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,And master to me: Albert of CologneIs this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur'd,Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.That next resplendence issues from the smileOf Gratian, who to either forum lentSuch help, as favour wins in Paradise.The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,Was Peter, he that with the widow gaveTo holy church his treasure.  The fifth light,Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,That all your world craves tidings of its doom:Within, there is the lofty light, endow'dWith sapience so profound, if truth be truth,That with a ken of such wide amplitudeNo second hath arisen.  Next beholdThat taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,Clearliest, the nature and the ministryAngelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.In the other little light serenely smilesThat pleader for the Christian temples, heWho did provide Augustin of his lore.Now, if thy mind's eye pass from light to light,Upon my praises following, of the eighthThy thirst is next.  The saintly soul, that showsThe world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,Blest there.  The limbs, whence it was driven, lieDown in Cieldauro, and from martyrdomAnd exile came it here.  Lo! further on,Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,In deep discernment.  Lastly this, from whomThy look on me reverteth, was the beamOf one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,Rebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death.It is the eternal light of Sigebert,Who 'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,Reading in the straw-litter'd street."  Forthwith,As clock, that calleth up the spouse of GodTo win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,Each part of other fitly drawn and urg'd,Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,Affection springs in well-disposed breast;Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heardVoice answ'ring voice, so musical and soft,It can be known but where day endless shines.CANTO XIO fond anxiety of mortal men!How vain and inconclusive argumentsAre those, which make thee beat thy wings belowFor statues one, and one for aphorismsWas hunting; this the priesthood follow'd, thatBy force or sophistry aspir'd to rule;To rob another, and another soughtBy civil business wealth; one moiling layTangled in net of sensual delight,And one to witless indolence resign'd;What time from all these empty things escap'd,With Beatrice, I thus gloriouslyWas rais'd aloft, and made the guest of heav'n.They of the circle to that point, each one.Where erst it was, had turn'd; and steady glow'd,As candle in his socket.  Then withinThe lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smilingWith merer gladness, heard I thus begin:"E'en as his beam illumes me, so I lookInto the eternal light, and clearly markThy thoughts, from whence they rise.  Thou art in doubt,And wouldst, that I should bolt my words afreshIn such plain open phrase, as may be smoothTo thy perception, where I told thee lateThat 'well they thrive;' and that 'no second suchHath risen,' which no small distinction needs."The providence, that governeth the world,In depth of counsel by created kenUnfathomable, to the end that she,Who with loud cries was 'spous'd in precious blood,Might keep her footing towards her well-belov'd,Safe in herself and constant unto him,Hath two ordain'd, who should on either handIn chief escort her: one seraphic allIn fervency; for wisdom upon earth,The other splendour of cherubic light.I but of one will tell: he tells of both,Who one commendeth which of them so'erBe taken: for their deeds were to one end."Between Tupino, and the wave, that fallsFrom blest Ubaldo's chosen hill, there hangsRich slope of mountain high, whence heat and coldAre wafted through Perugia's eastern gate:And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rearMourn for their heavy yoke.  Upon that side,Where it doth break its steepness most, aroseA sun upon the world, as duly thisFrom Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speakOf that place, say Ascesi; for its nameWere lamely so deliver'd; but the East,To call things rightly, be it henceforth styl'd.He was not yet much distant from his rising,When his good influence 'gan to bless the earth.A dame to whom none openeth pleasure's gateMore than to death, was, 'gainst his father's will,His stripling choice: and he did make her his,Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,And in his father's sight: from day to day,Then lov'd her more devoutly.  She, bereav'dOf her first husband, slighted and obscure,Thousand and hundred years and more, remain'dWithout a single suitor, till he came.Nor aught avail'd, that, with Amyclas, sheWas found unmov'd at rumour of his voice,Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldnessWhereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,When Mary stay'd beneath.  But not to dealThus closely with thee longer, take at largeThe rovers' titles--Poverty and Francis.Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,So much, that venerable Bernard firstDid bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peaceSo heavenly, ran, yet deem'd his footing slow.O hidden riches!  O prolific good!Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,And follow both the bridegroom; so the brideCan please them.  Thenceforth goes he on his way,The father and the master, with his spouse,And with that family, whom now the cordGirt humbly: nor did abjectness of heartWeigh down his eyelids, for that he was sonOf Pietro Bernardone, and by menIn wond'rous sort despis'd.  But royallyHis hard intention he to InnocentSet forth, and from him first receiv'd the sealOn his religion.

On the hard rock,'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from ChristTook the last Signet, which his limbs two yearsDid carry.  Then the season come, that he,Who to such good had destin'd him, was pleas'dT' advance him to the meed, which he had earn'dBy his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,As their just heritage, he gave in chargeHis dearest lady, and enjoin'd their loveAnd faith to her: and, from her bosom, will'dHis goodly spirit should move forth, returningTo its appointed kingdom, nor would haveHis body laid upon another bier."Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,To keep the bark of Peter in deep seaHelm'd to right point; and such our Patriarch was.Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in.But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,So that they needs into strange pastures wideMust spread them: and the more remote from himThe stragglers wander, so much mole they comeHome to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks."Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta'enGood heed, if that, which I have told, recallTo mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill'd:For thou wilt see the point from whence they split,Nor miss of the reproof, which that implies,'That well they thrive not sworn with vanity."'CANTO XIISoon as its final word the blessed flameHad rais'd for utterance, straight the holy millBegan to wheel, nor yet had once revolv'd,Or ere another, circling, compass'd it,Motion to motion, song to song, conjoining,Song, that as much our muses doth excel,Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes, as rayOf primal splendour doth its faint reflex.As when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth,Two arches parallel, and trick'd alike,Span the thin cloud, the outer taking birthFrom that within (in manner of that voiceWhom love did melt away, as sun the mist),And they who gaze, presageful call to mindThe compact, made with Noah, of the worldNo more to be o'erflow'd; about us thusOf sempiternal roses, bending, wreath'dThose garlands twain, and to the innermostE'en thus th' external answered.

Where one is,The other worthily should also be;That as their warfare was alike, alikeShould be their glory.  Slow, and full of doubt,And with thin ranks, after its banner mov'dThe army of Christ (which it so clearly costTo reappoint), when its imperial Head,Who reigneth ever, for the drooping hostDid make provision, thorough grace alone,And not through its deserving.

In that clime,Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfoldThe fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herselfNew-garmented; nor from those billows far,Beyond whose chiding, after weary course,The sun doth sometimes hide him, safe abidesThe happy Callaroga, under guardOf the great shield, wherein the lion liesSubjected and supreme.  And there was bornThe loving million of the Christian faith,The hollow'd wrestler, gentle to his own,And to his enemies terrible.  So repleteHis soul with lively virtue, that when firstCreated, even in the mother's womb,It prophesied.  When, at the sacred font,The spousals were complete 'twixt faith and him,Where pledge of mutual safety was exchang'd,The dame, who was his surety, in her sleepBeheld the wondrous fruit, that was from himAnd from his heirs to issue.  And that suchHe might be construed, as indeed he was,She was inspir'd to name him of his owner,Whose he was wholly, and so call'd him Dominic.And I speak of him, as the labourer,Whom Christ in his own garden chose to beHis help-mate.  Messenger he seem'd, and friendFast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show'd,Was after the first counsel that Christ gave.Many a time his nurse, at entering foundThat he had ris'n in silence, and was prostrate,As who should say, "My errand was for this."O happy father!

But the track,Which its smooth fellies made, is now deserted:That mouldy mother is where late were lees.His family, that wont to trace his path,Turn backward, and invert their steps; erelongTo rue the gathering in of their ill crop,When the rejected tares in vain shall askAdmittance to the barn.

Illuminato here,And Agostino join me: two they were,Among the first of those barefooted meek ones,Who sought God's friendship in the cord: with themHugues of Saint Victor, Pietro Mangiadore,And he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining,Nathan the prophet, MetropolitanChrysostom, and Anselmo, and, who deign'dTo put his hand to the first art, Donatus.Raban is here: and at my side there shinesCalabria's abbot, Joachim, endow'dWith soul prophetic.  The bright courtesyOf friar Thomas, and his goodly lore,Have mov'd me to the blazon of a peerSo worthy, and with me have mov'd this throng."CANTO XIIILet him, who would conceive what now I saw,Imagine (and retain the image firm,As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),Of stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal hostSelected, that, with lively ray serene,O'ercome the massiest air: thereto imagineThe wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,Spins ever on its axle night and day,With the bright summit of that horn which swellsDue from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,T' have rang'd themselves in fashion of two signsIn heav'n, such as Ariadne made,When death's chill seized her; and that one of themDid compass in the other's beam; and bothIn such sort whirl around, that each should tendWith opposite motion and, conceiving thus,Of that true constellation, and the danceTwofold, that circled me, he shall attainAs 't were the shadow; for things there as muchSurpass our usage, as the swiftest heav'nIs swifter than the Chiana.  There was sungNo Bacchus, and no Io Paean, butThree Persons in the Godhead, and in oneSubstance that nature and the human join'd.The song fulfill'd its measure; and to usThose saintly lights attended, happier madeAt each new minist'ring.  Then silence brake,Amid th' accordant sons of Deity,That luminary, in which the wondrous lifeOf the meek man of God was told to me;And thus it spake: "One ear o' th' harvest thresh'd,And its grain safely stor'd, sweet charityInvites me with the other to like toil."Thou know'st, that in the bosom, whence the ribWas ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose tasteAll the world pays for, and in that, which pierc'dBy the keen lance, both after and beforeSuch satisfaction offer'd, as outweighsEach evil in the scale, whate'er of lightTo human nature is allow'd, must allHave by his virtue been infus'd, who form'dBoth one and other: and thou thence admir'stIn that I told thee, of beatitudesA second, there is none, to his enclos'dIn the fifth radiance.  Open now thine eyesTo what I answer thee; and thou shalt seeThy deeming and my saying meet in truth,As centre in the round.  That which dies not,And that which can die, are but each the beamOf that idea, which our Soverign SireEngendereth loving; for that lively light,Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin'dFrom him, nor from his love triune with them,Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,Mirror'd, as 't were in new existences,Itself unalterable and ever one."Descending hence unto the lowest powers,Its energy so sinks, at last it makesBut brief contingencies: for so I nameThings generated, which the heav'nly orbsMoving, with seed or without seed, produce.Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:And thence with lustre, more or less, it showsTh' ideal stamp impress: so that one treeAccording to his kind, hath better fruit,And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,Are in your talents various.  Were the waxMolded with nice exactness, and the heav'nIn its disposing influence supreme,The lustre of the seal should be complete:But nature renders it imperfect ever,Resembling thus the artist in her work,Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.Howe'er, if love itself dispose, and markThe primal virtue, kindling with bright view,There all perfection is vouchsafed; and suchThe clay was made, accomplish'd with each gift,That life can teem with; such the burden fill'dThe virgin's bosom: so that I commendThy judgment, that the human nature ne'erWas or can be, such as in them it was."Did I advance no further than this point,'How then had he no peer?'  thou might'st reply.But, that what now appears not, may appearRight plainly, ponder, who he was, and what(When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'dTo his requesting.  I have spoken thus,That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'dFor wisdom, to the end he might be kingSufficient: not the number to search outOf the celestial movers; or to know,If necessary with contingent e'erHave made necessity; or whether thatBe granted, that first motion is; or ifOf the mid circle can, by art, be madeTriangle with each corner, blunt or sharp."Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,At which the dart of my intention aims.And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'Thou shalt discern it only hath respectTo kings, of whom are many, and the goodAre rare.  With this distinction take my words;And they may well consist with that which thouOf the first human father dost believe,And of our well-beloved.  And let thisHenceforth be led unto thy feet, to makeThee slow in motion, as a weary man,Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.For he among the fools is down full low,Whose affirmation, or denial, isWithout distinction, in each case alikeSince it befalls, that in most instancesCurrent opinion leads to false: and thenAffection bends the judgment to her ply."Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,Since he returns not such as he set forth,Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.And open proofs of this unto the worldHave been afforded in Parmenides,Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,Who journey'd on, and knew not whither: so didSabellius, Arius, and the other fools,Who, like to scymitars, reflected backThe scripture-image, by distortion marr'd."Let not the people be too swift to judge,As one who reckons on the blades in field,Or ere the crop be ripe.  For I have seenThe thorn frown rudely all the winter longAnd after bear the rose upon its top;And bark, that all the way across the seaRan straight and speedy, perish at the last,E'en in the haven's mouth seeing one steal,Another brine, his offering to the priest,Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thenceInto heav'n's counsels deem that they can pry:For one of these may rise, the other fall."CANTO XIVFrom centre to the circle, and so backFrom circle to the centre, water movesIn the round chalice, even as the blowImpels it, inwardly, or from without.Such was the image glanc'd into my mind,As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas'd;And Beatrice after him her wordsResum'd alternate: "Need there is (tho' yetHe tells it to you not in words, nor e'enIn thought) that he should fathom to its depthAnother mystery.  Tell him, if the light,Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with youEternally, as now: and, if it doth,How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,The sight may without harm endure the change,That also tell."  As those, who in a ringTread the light measure, in their fitful mirthRaise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,The saintly circles in their tourneyingAnd wond'rous note attested new delight.Whoso laments, that we must doff this garbOf frail mortality, thenceforth to liveImmortally above, he hath not seenThe sweet refreshing, of that heav'nly shower.Him, who lives ever, and for ever reignsIn mystic union of the Three in One,Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thriceSang, with such melody, as but to hearFor highest merit were an ample meed.And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,With gentle voice and mild, such as perhapsThe angel's once to Mary, thus replied:"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;And that as far in blessedness exceeding,As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.Our shape, regarmented with glorious weedsOf saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,Show yet more gracious.  Therefore shall increase,Whate'er of light, gratuitous, impartsThe Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,The better disclose his glory: whenceThe vision needs increasing, much increaseThe fervour, which it kindles; and that tooThe ray, that comes from it.  But as the greedWhich gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shinesMore lively than that, and so preservesIts proper semblance; thus this circling sphereOf splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earthNow covers.  Nor will such excess of lightO'erpower us, in corporeal organs madeFirm, and susceptible of all delight."So ready and so cordial an "Amen,"Followed from either choir, as plainly spokeDesire of their dead bodies; yet perchanceNot for themselves, but for their kindred dear,Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd,Ere they were made imperishable flame.And lo! forthwith there rose up round aboutA lustre over that already there,Of equal clearness, like the brightening upOf the horizon.  As at an evening hourOf twilight, new appearances through heav'nPeer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;So there new substances, methought beganTo rise in view; and round the other twainEnwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.O gentle glitter of eternal beam!With what a such whiteness did it flow,O'erpowering vision in me!  But so fair,So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd,Mind cannot follow it, nor words expressHer infinite sweetness.  Thence mine eyes regain'dPower to look up, and I beheld myself,Sole with my lady, to more lofty blissTranslated: for the star, with warmer smileImpurpled, well denoted our ascent.With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaksThe same in all, an holocaust I madeTo God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd.And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'dThe fuming of that incense, when I knewThe rite accepted.  With such mighty sheenAnd mantling crimson, in two listed raysThe splendours shot before me, that I cried,"God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!"As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,Distinguish'd into greater lights and less,Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,Those rays describ'd the venerable sign,That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.Here memory mocks the toil of genius.  ChristBeam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now.But whoso takes his cross, and follows ChristWill pardon me for that I leave untold,When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spyThe glitterance of Christ.  From horn to horn,And 'tween the summit and the base did moveLights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd.Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,The atomies of bodies, long or short,To move along the sunbeam, whose slant lineCheckers the shadow, interpos'd by artAgainst the noontide heat.  And as the chimeOf minstrel music, dulcimer, and helpWith many strings, a pleasant dining makesTo him, who heareth not distinct the note;So from the lights, which there appear'd to me,Gather'd along the cross a melody,That, indistinctly heard, with ravishmentPossess'd me.  Yet I mark'd it was a hymnOf lofty praises; for there came to me"Arise and conquer," as to one who hearsAnd comprehends not.  Me such ecstasyO'ercame, that never till that hour was thingThat held me in so sweet imprisonment.Perhaps my saying over bold appears,Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.But he, who is aware those living sealsOf every beauty work with quicker force,The higher they are ris'n; and that thereI had not turn'd me to them; he may wellExcuse me that, whereof in my excuseI do accuse me, and may own my truth;That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd,Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.CANTO XVTrue love, that ever shows itself as clearIn kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'dThe sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right handUnwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayersShould they not hearken, who, to give me willFor praying, in accordance thus were mute?He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,Despoils himself forever of that love.As oft along the still and pure serene,At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,Attracting with involuntary heedThe eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,And seems some star that shifted place in heav'n,Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,That on the dexter of the cross extends,Down to its foot, one luminary ranFrom mid the cluster shone there; yet no gemDropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy listLike flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aughtOur greater muse may claim) the pious ghostOf old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,When he perceiv'd his son.  "O thou, my blood!O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gateBeen e'er unclos'd?" so spake the light; whence ITurn'd me toward him; then unto my dameMy sight directed, and on either sideAmazement waited me; for in her eyesWas lighted such a smile, I thought that mineHad div'd unto the bottom of my graceAnd of my bliss in Paradise.  ForthwithTo hearing and to sight grateful alike,The spirit to his proem added thingsI understood not, so profound he spake;Yet not of choice but through necessityMysterious; for his high conception scar'dBeyond the mark of mortals.  When the flightOf holy transport had so spent its rage,That nearer to the level of our thoughtThe speech descended, the first sounds I heardWere, "Best he thou, Triunal Deity!That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!"Then follow'd: "No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,Which took me reading in the sacred book,Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,From whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her.Who for such lofty mounting has with plumesBegirt thee.  Thou dost deem thy thoughts to meFrom him transmitted, who is first of all,E'en as all numbers ray from unity;And therefore dost not ask me who I am,Or why to thee more joyous I appear,Than any other in this gladsome throng.The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hueBoth less and greater in that mirror look,In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown.But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,May be contended fully, let thy voice,Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forthThy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,Whereto my ready answer stands decreed."I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heardEre I had spoken, smiling, an assent,That to my will gave wings; and I began"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'dThe nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;For that they are so equal in the sun,From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,As makes all likeness scant.  But will and means,In mortals, for the cause ye well discern,With unlike wings are fledge.  A mortal IExperience inequality like this,And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,For thy paternal greeting.  This howe'erI pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'stThis precious jewel, let me hear thy name.""I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expectEven, hath pleas'd me:" thus the prompt replyPrefacing, next it added; "he, of whomThy kindred appellation comes, and who,These hundred years and more, on its first ledgeHath circuited the mountain, was my sonAnd thy great grandsire.  Well befits, his longEndurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds."Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace.She had no armlets and no head-tires then,No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eyeMore than the person did.  Time was not yet,When at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale.For fear the age and dowry should exceedOn each side just proportion.  House was noneVoid of its family; nor yet had comeHardanapalus, to exhibit featsOf chamber prowess.  Montemalo yetO'er our suburban turret rose; as muchTo be surpass in fall, as in its rising.I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroadIn leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,His lady leave the glass.  The sons I sawOf Nerli and of Vecchio well contentWith unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handlingThe spindle and the flax; O happy they!Each sure of burial in her native land,And none left desolate a-bed for France!One wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing itWith sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:Another, with her maidens, drawing offThe tresses from the distaff, lectur'd themOld tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.A Salterello and Cianghella weHad held as strange a marvel, as ye wouldA Cincinnatus or Cornelia now."In such compos'd and seemly fellowship,Such faithful and such fair equality,In so sweet household, Mary at my birthBestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and thereIn your old baptistery, I was madeChristian at once and Cacciaguida; as wereMy brethren, Eliseo and Moronto."From Valdipado came to me my spouse,And hence thy surname grew.  I follow'd thenThe Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood heDid gird on me; in such good part he tookMy valiant service.  After him I wentTo testify against that evil law,Whose people, by the shepherd's fault, possessYour right, usurping.  There, by that foul crewWas I releas'd from the deceitful world,Whose base affection many a spirit soils,And from the martyrdom came to this peace."CANTO XVIO slight respect of man's nobility!I never shall account it marvelous,That our infirm affection here belowThou mov'st to boasting, when I could not choose,E'en in that region of unwarp'd desire,In heav'n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!Yet cloak thou art soon shorten'd, for that time,Unless thou be eked out from day to day,Goes round thee with his shears.  Resuming thenWith greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,But since hath disaccustom'd I began;And Beatrice, that a little spaceWas sever'd, smil'd reminding me of her,Whose cough embolden'd (as the story holds)To first offence the doubting Guenever."You are my sire," said I, "you give me heartFreely to speak my thought: above myselfYou raise me.  Through so many streams with joyMy soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it;So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts notSay then, my honour'd stem! what ancestorsWhere those you sprang from, and what years were mark'dIn your first childhood?  Tell me of the fold,That hath Saint John for guardian, what was thenIts state, and who in it were highest seated?"As embers, at the breathing of the wind,Their flame enliven, so that light I sawShine at my blandishments; and, as it grewMore fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwithIt answer'd: "From the day, when it was said'Hail Virgin!' to the throes, by which my mother,Who now is sainted, lighten'd her of meWhom she was heavy with, this fire had come,Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beamsTo reilumine underneath the footOf its own lion.  They, of whom I sprang,And I, had there our birth-place, where the lastPartition of our city first is reach'dBy him, that runs her annual game.  Thus muchSuffice of my forefathers: who they were,And whence they hither came, more honourableIt is to pass in silence than to tell.All those, who in that time were there from MarsUntil the Baptist, fit to carry arms,Were but the fifth of them this day alive.But then the citizen's blood, that now is mix'dFrom Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,Ran purely through the last mechanic's veins.O how much better were it, that these peopleWere neighbours to you, and that at GalluzzoAnd at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,Than to have them within, and bear the stenchOf Aguglione's hind, and Signa's, him,That hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!Had not the people, which of all the worldDegenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,But, as a mother, gracious to her son;Such one, as hath become a Florentine,And trades and traffics, had been turn'd adriftTo Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'dThe beggar's craft.  The Conti were possess'dOf Montemurlo still: the Cerchi stillWere in Acone's parish; nor had haplyFrom Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.The city's malady hath ever sourceIn the confusion of its persons, asThe body's, in variety of food:And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one swordDoth more and better execution,Than five.  Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,How they are gone, and after them how goChiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seemNo longer new or strange to thee to hear,That families fail, when cities have their end.All things, that appertain t' ye, like yourselves,Are mortal: but mortality in someYe mark not, they endure so long, and youPass by so suddenly.  And as the moonDoth, by the rolling of her heav'nly sphere,Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;So fortune deals with Florence.  Hence admire notAt what of them I tell thee, whose renownTime covers, the first Florentines.  I sawThe Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:And great as ancient, of Sannella him,With him of Arca saw, and SoldanieriAnd Ardinghi, and Bostichi.  At the poop,That now is laden with new felony,So cumb'rous it may speedily sink the bark,The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprungThe County Guido, and whoso hath sinceHis title from the fam'd Bellincione ta'en.Fair governance was yet an art well priz'dBy him of Pressa: Galigaio show'dThe gilded hilt and pommel, in his house.The column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seenUnshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,With them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunkWas in its strength: and to the curule chairsSizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.How mighty them I saw, whom since their prideHath undone! and in all her goodly deedsFlorence was by the bullets of bright goldO'erflourish'd.  Such the sires of those, who now,As surely as your church is vacant, flockInto her consistory, and at leisureThere stall them and grow fat.  The o'erweening brood,That plays the dragon after him that flees,But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem'd,That Ubertino of Donati grudg'dHis father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.Already Caponsacco had descendedInto the mart from Fesole: and GiudaAnd Infangato were good citizens.A thing incredible I tell, tho' true:The gateway, named from those of Pera, ledInto the narrow circuit of your walls.Each one, who bears the sightly quarteringsOf the great Baron (he whose name and worthThe festival of Thomas still revives)His knighthood and his privilege retain'd;Albeit one, who borders them With gold,This day is mingled with the common herd.In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,And Importuni: well for its reposeHad it still lack'd of newer neighbourhood.The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,Through the just anger that hath murder'd yeAnd put a period to your gladsome days,Was honour'd, it, and those consorted with it.O Buondelmonte! what ill counselingPrevail'd on thee to break the plighted bondMany, who now are weeping, would rejoice,Had God to Ema giv'n thee, the first timeThou near our city cam'st.  But so was doom'd:On that maim'd stone set up to guard the bridge,At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell.With these and others like to them, I sawFlorence in such assur'd tranquility,She had no cause at which to grieve: with theseSaw her so glorious and so just, that ne'erThe lily from the lance had hung reverse,Or through division been with vermeil dyed."CANTO XVIISuch as the youth, who came to ClymeneTo certify himself of that reproach,Which had been fasten'd on him, (he whose endStill makes the fathers chary to their sons),E'en such was I; nor unobserv'd was suchOf Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,Who had erewhile for me his station mov'd;When thus by lady: "Give thy wish free vent,That it may issue, bearing true reportOf the mind's impress; not that aught thy wordsMay to our knowledge add, but to the end,That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirstAnd men may mingle for thee when they hear.""O plant! from whence I spring! rever'd and lov'd!Who soar'st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,As earthly thought determines two obtuseIn one triangle not contain'd, so clearDost see contingencies, ere in themselvesExistent, looking at the point wheretoAll times are present, I, the whilst I scal'dWith Virgil the soul purifying mount,And visited the nether world of woe,Touching my future destiny have heardWords grievous, though I feel me on all sidesWell squar'd to fortune's blows.  Therefore my willWere satisfied to know the lot awaits me,The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight."So said I to the brightness, which erewhileTo me had spoken, and my will declar'd,As Beatrice will'd, explicitly.Nor with oracular response obscure,Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,Beguil'd the credulous nations; but, in termsPrecise and unambiguous lore, repliedThe spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:"Contingency, unfolded not to viewUpon the tablet of your mortal mold,Is all depictur'd in the' eternal sight;But hence deriveth not necessity,More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene.From thence, as to the ear sweet harmonyFrom organ comes, so comes before mine eyeThe time prepar'd for thee.  Such as driv'n outFrom Athens, by his cruel stepdame's wiles,Hippolytus departed, such must thouDepart from Florence.  This they wish, and thisContrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,Throughout the livelong day.  The common cry,Will, as 't is ever wont, affix the blameUnto the party injur'd: but the truthShall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, findA faithful witness.  Thou shall leave each thingBelov'd most dearly: this is the first shaftShot from the bow of exile.  Thou shalt proveHow salt the savour is of other's bread,How hard the passage to descend and climbBy other's stairs, But that shall gall thee mostWill be the worthless and vile company,With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,Shall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little whileTheirs and not thine shall be the crimson'd browTheir course shall so evince their brutishnessT' have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee."First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,In the great Lombard's courtesy, who bearsUpon the ladder perch'd the sacred bird.He shall behold thee with such kind regard,That 'twixt ye two, the contrary to thatWhich falls 'twixt other men, the granting shallForerun the asking.  With him shalt thou seeThat mortal, who was at his birth impressSo strongly from this star, that of his deedsThe nations shall take note.  His unripe ageYet holds him from observance; for these wheelsOnly nine years have compass him about.But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,In equal scorn of labours and of gold.His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,As not to let the tongues e'en of his foesBe idle in its praise.  Look thou to himAnd his beneficence: for he shall causeReversal of their lot to many people,Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.And thou shalt bear this written in thy soulOf him, but tell it not;" and things he toldIncredible to those who witness them;Then added: "So interpret thou, my son,What hath been told thee.--Lo! the ambushmentThat a few circling seasons hide for thee!Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extendsThy span beyond their treason's chastisement."Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,Had shown the web, which I had streteh'd for himUpon the warp, was woven, I began,As one, who in perplexity desiresCounsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:"My father! well I mark how time spurs onToward me, ready to inflict the blow,Which falls most heavily on him, who mostAbandoned himself.  Therefore 't is goodI should forecast, that driven from the placeMost dear to me, I may not lose myselfAll others by my song.  Down through the worldOf infinite mourning, and along the mountFrom whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me,And after through this heav'n from light to light,Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,It may with many woefully disrelish;And, if I am a timid friend to truth,I fear my life may perish among those,To whom these days shall be of ancient date."The brightness, where enclos'd the treasure smil'd,Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,Like to a golden mirror in the sun;Next answer'd: "Conscience, dimm'd or by its ownOr other's shame, will feel thy saying sharp.Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov'd,See the whole vision be made manifest.And let them wince who have their withers wrung.What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall proveUnwelcome, on digestion it will turnTo vital nourishment.  The cry thou raisest,Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;Which is of honour no light argument,For this there only have been shown to thee,Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,Spirits, whom fame hath note of.  For the mindOf him, who hears, is loth to acquiesceAnd fix its faith, unless the instance broughtBe palpable, and proof apparent urge."CANTO XVIIICANTO XVIIINow in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'dThat blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,Who led me unto God, admonish'd: "MuseOn other thoughts: bethink thee, that near HimI dwell, who recompenseth every wrong."At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn'd;And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,I leave in silence here: nor through distrustOf my words only, but that to such blissThe mind remounts not without aid.  Thus muchYet may I speak; that, as I gaz'd on her,Affection found no room for other wish.While the everlasting pleasure, that did fullOn Beatrice shine, with second viewFrom her fair countenance my gladden'd soulContented; vanquishing me with a beamOf her soft smile, she spake: "Turn thee, and list.These eyes are not thy only Paradise."As here we sometimes in the looks may seeTh' affection mark'd, when that its sway hath ta'enThe spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,To whom I turn'd, flashing, bewray'd its willTo talk yet further with me, and began:"On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose lifeIs from its top, whose fruit is ever fairAnd leaf unwith'ring, blessed spirits abide,That were below, ere they arriv'd in heav'n,So mighty in renown, as every museMight grace her triumph with them.  On the hornsLook therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloudIts nimble fire."  Along the cross I saw,At the repeated name of Joshua,A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,Ere it was done: then, at the naming sawOf the great Maccabee, another moveWith whirling speed; and gladness was the scourgeUnto that top.  The next for CharlemagneAnd for the peer Orlando, two my gazePursued, intently, as the eye pursuesA falcon flying.  Last, along the cross,William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drewMy ken, and Robert Guiscard.  And the soul,Who spake with me among the other lightsDid move away, and mix; and with the choirOf heav'nly songsters prov'd his tuneful skill.To Beatrice on my right l bent,Looking for intimation or by wordOr act, what next behoov'd; and did descrySuch mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,It past all former wont.  And, as by senseOf new delight, the man, who perseveresIn good deeds doth perceive from day to dayHis virtue growing; I e'en thus perceiv'dOf my ascent, together with the heav'nThe circuit widen'd, noting the increaseOf beauty in that wonder.  Like the changeIn a brief moment on some maiden's cheek,Which from its fairness doth discharge the weightOf pudency, that stain'd it; such in her,And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,Whose sixth orb now enfolded us.  I saw,Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparksOf love, that reign'd there, fashion to my viewOur language.  And as birds, from river banksArisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop,Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,The saintly creatures flying, sang, and madeNow D. now I. now L. figur'd I' th' air.First, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then oneBecoming of these signs, a little whileDid rest them, and were mute.  O nymph divineOf Pegasean race! whose souls, which thouInspir'st, mak'st glorious and long-liv'd, as theyCities and realms by thee! thou with thyselfInform me; that I may set forth the shapes,As fancy doth present them.  Be thy powerDisplay'd in this brief song.  The characters,Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.In order each, as they appear'd, I mark'd.Diligite Justitiam, the first,Both verb and noun all blazon'd; and the extremeQui judicatis terram.  In the M.Of the fifth word they held their station,Making the star seem silver streak'd with gold.And on the summit of the M. I sawDescending other lights, that rested there,Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good.Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,Sparkles innumerable on all sidesRise scatter'd, source of augury to th' unwise;Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres henceSeem'd reascending, and a higher pitchSome mounting, and some less; e'en as the sun,Which kindleth them, decreed.  And when each oneHad settled in his place, the head and neckThen saw I of an eagle, livelyGrav'd in that streaky fire.  Who painteth there,Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;And every line and texture of the nestDoth own from him the virtue, fashions it.The other bright beatitude, that seem'dErewhile, with lilied crowning, well contentTo over-canopy the M. mov'd forth,Following gently the impress of the bird. Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gemsDeclar'd to me our justice on the earthTo be the effluence of that heav'n, which thou,Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whomThy motion and thy virtue are begun,That he would look from whence the fog doth rise,To vitiate thy beam: so that once moreHe may put forth his hand 'gainst such, as driveTheir traffic in that sanctuary, whose wallsWith miracles and martyrdoms were built.Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey!O beg ye grace for those, that are on earthAll after ill example gone astray.War once had for its instrument the sword:But now 't is made, taking the bread awayWhich the good Father locks from none.  --And thou,That writes but to cancel, think, that they,Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.Thou hast good cause to cry, "My heart so cleavesTo him, that liv'd in solitude remote,And from the wilds was dragg'd to martyrdom,I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul."CANTO XIXBefore my sight appear'd, with open wings,The beauteous image, in fruition sweetGladdening the thronged spirits.  Each did seemA little ruby, whereon so intenseThe sun-beam glow'd that to mine eyes it cameIn clear refraction.  And that, which nextBefalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd,Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasyWas e'er conceiv'd.  For I beheld and heardThe beak discourse; and, what intention form'dOf many, singly as of one express,Beginning: "For that I was just and piteous,l am exalted to this height of glory,The which no wish exceeds: and there on earthHave I my memory left, e'en by the badCommended, while they leave its course untrod."Thus is one heat from many embers felt,As in that image many were the loves,And one the voice, that issued from them all.Whence I address them: "O perennial flowersOf gladness everlasting! that exhaleIn single breath your odours manifold!Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas'd,That with great craving long hath held my soul,Finding no food on earth.  This well I know,That if there be in heav'n a realm, that showsIn faithful mirror the celestial Justice,Yours without veil reflects it.  Ye discernThe heed, wherewith I do prepare myselfTo hearken; ye the doubt that urges meWith such inveterate craving."  Straight I saw,Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.So saw I move that stately sign, with praiseOf grace divine inwoven and high songOf inexpressive joy.  "He," it began,"Who turn'd his compass on the world's extreme,And in that space so variously hath wrought,Both openly, and in secret, in such wiseCould not through all the universe displayImpression of his glory, that the WordOf his omniscience should not still remainIn infinite excess.  In proof whereof,He first through pride supplanted, who was sumOf each created being, waited notFor light celestial, and abortive fell.Whence needs each lesser nature is but scantReceptacle unto that Good, which knowsNo limit, measur'd by itself alone.Therefore your sight, of th' omnipresent MindA single beam, its origin must ownSurpassing far its utmost potency.The ken, your world is gifted with, descendsIn th' everlasting Justice as low down,As eye doth in the sea; which though it markThe bottom from the shore, in the wide mainDiscerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is,But hidden through its deepness.  Light is none,Save that which cometh from the pure sereneOf ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,'Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,Or else its poison.  Here confess reveal'dThat covert, which hath hidden from thy searchThe living justice, of the which thou mad'stSuch frequent question; for thou saidst--'A manIs born on Indus' banks, and none is thereWho speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,And all his inclinations and his acts,As far as human reason sees, are good,And he offendeth not in word or deed.But unbaptiz'd he dies, and void of faith.Where is the justice that condemns him?  whereHis blame, if he believeth not?'--What then,And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sitTo judge at distance of a thousand milesWith the short-sighted vision of a span?To him, who subtilizes thus with me,There would assuredly be room for doubtEven to wonder, did not the safe wordOf scripture hold supreme authority."O animals of clay!  O spirits gross IThe primal will, that in itself is good,Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been mov'd.Justice consists in consonance with it,Derivable by no created good,Whose very cause depends upon its beam."As on her nest the stork, that turns aboutUnto her young, whom lately she hath fed,While they with upward eyes do look on her;So lifted I my gaze; and bending soThe ever-blessed image wav'd its wings,Lab'ring with such deep counsel.  Wheeling roundIt warbled, and did say: "As are my notesTo thee, who understand'st them not, such isTh' eternal judgment unto mortal ken."Then still abiding in that ensign rang'd,Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,Those burning splendours of the Holy SpiritTook up the strain; and thus it spake again:"None ever hath ascended to this realm,Who hath not a believer been in Christ,Either before or after the blest limbsWere nail'd upon the wood.  But lo! of thoseWho call 'Christ, Christ,' there shall be many found, In judgment, further off from him by far,Than such, to whom his name was never known.Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:When that the two assemblages shall part;One rich eternally, the other poor."What may the Persians say unto your kings,When they shall see that volume, in the whichAll their dispraise is written, spread to view?There amidst Albert's works shall that be read,Which will give speedy motion to the pen,When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.There shall be read the woe, that he doth workWith his adulterate money on the Seine,Who by the tusk will perish: there be readThe thirsting pride, that maketh fool alikeThe English and Scot, impatient of their bound.There shall be seen the Spaniard's luxury,The delicate living there of the Bohemian,Who still to worth has been a willing stranger.The halter of Jerusalem shall seeA unit for his virtue, for his vicesNo less a mark than million.  He, who guardsThe isle of fire by old Anchises honour'dShall find his avarice there and cowardice;And better to denote his littleness,The writing must be letters maim'd, that speakMuch in a narrow space.  All there shall knowHis uncle and his brother's filthy doings,Who so renown'd a nation and two crownsHave bastardized.  And they, of PortugalAnd Norway, there shall be expos'd with himOf Ratza, who hath counterfeited illThe coin of Venice.  O blest Hungary!If thou no longer patiently abid'stThy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm theeIn earnest of that day, e'en now are heardWailings and groans in Famagosta's streetsAnd Nicosia's, grudging at their beast,Who keepeth even footing with the rest."CANTO XXWhen, disappearing, from our hemisphere,The world's enlightener vanishes, and dayOn all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,Is yet again unfolded, putting forthInnumerable lights wherein one shines.Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,As the great sign, that marshaleth the worldAnd the world's leaders, in the blessed beakWas silent; for that all those living lights,Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,Such as from memory glide and fall away.Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!After the precious and bright beaming stones,That did ingem the sixth light, ceas'd the chimingOf their angelic bells; methought I heardThe murmuring of a river, that doth fallFrom rock to rock transpicuous, making knownThe richness of his spring-head: and as soundOf cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, roseThat murmuring of the eagle, and forthwithVoice there assum'd, and thence along the beakIssued in form of words, such as my heartDid look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them."The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,In mortal eagles," it began, "must nowBe noted steadfastly: for of the fires,That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,Are chief of all the greatest.  This, that shinesMidmost for pupil, was the same, who sangThe Holy Spirit's song, and bare aboutThe ark from town to town; now doth he knowThe merit of his soul-impassion'd strainsBy their well-fitted guerdon.  Of the five,That make the circle of the vision, heWho to the beak is nearest, comfortedThe widow for her son: now doth he knowHow dear he costeth not to follow Christ,Both from experience of this pleasant life,And of its opposite.  He next, who followsIn the circumference, for the over arch,By true repenting slack'd the pace of death:Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'nAlter not, when through pious prayer belowToday's is made tomorrow's destiny.The other following, with the laws and me,To yield the shepherd room, pass'd o'er to Greece,From good intent producing evil fruit:Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'dFrom his well doing, doth not helm him aught,Though it have brought destruction on the world.That, which thou seest in the under bow,Was William, whom that land bewails, which weepsFor Charles and Frederick living: now he knowsHow well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.Who in the erring world beneath would deem,That Trojan Ripheus in this round was setFifth of the saintly splendours?  now he knowsEnough of that, which the world cannot see,The grace divine, albeit e'en his sightReach not its utmost depth."  Like to the lark,That warbling in the air expatiates long,Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear'dThat image stampt by the' everlasting pleasure,Which fashions like itself all lovely things.I, though my doubting were as manifest,As is through glass the hue that mantles it,In silence waited not: for to my lips"What things are these?"  involuntary rush'd,And forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'dA sudden lightening and new revelry.The eye was kindled: and the blessed signNo more to keep me wond'ring and suspense,Replied: "I see that thou believ'st these things,Because I tell them, but discern'st not how;So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:As one who knows the name of thing by rote,But is a stranger to its properties,Till other's tongue reveal them.  Fervent loveAnd lively hope with violence assailThe kingdom of the heavens, and overcomeThe will of the Most high; not in such sortAs man prevails o'er man; but conquers it,Because 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,Though conquer'd, by its mercy conquering."Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'stThe region of the angels deck'd with them.They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,This of the feet in future to be pierc'd,That of feet nail'd already to the cross.One from the barrier of the dark abyss,Where never any with good will returns,Came back unto his bones.  Of lively hopeSuch was the meed; of lively hope, that wing'dThe prayers sent up to God for his release,And put power into them to bend his will.The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,A little while returning to the flesh,Believ'd in him, who had the means to help,And, in believing, nourish'd such a flameOf holy love, that at the second deathHe was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.The other, through the riches of that grace,Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,As never eye created saw its rising,Plac'd all his love below on just and right:Wherefore of grace God op'd in him the eyeTo the redemption of mankind to come;Wherein believing, he endur'd no moreThe filth of paganism, and for their waysRebuk'd the stubborn nations.  The three nymphs,Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,Were sponsors for him more than thousand yearsBefore baptizing.  O how far remov'd,Predestination! is thy root from suchAs see not the First cause entire: and ye,O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:For we, who see our Maker, know not yetThe number of the chosen: and esteemSuch scantiness of knowledge our delight:For all our good is in that primal goodConcentrate, and God's will and ours are one."So, by that form divine, was giv'n to meSweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,And, as one handling skillfully the harp,Attendant on some skilful songster's voiceBids the chords vibrate, and therein the songAcquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,It doth remember me, that I beheldThe pair of blessed luminaries move.Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds.CANTO XXIAgain mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice,And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looksFound all contentment.  Yet no smile she woreAnd, "Did I smile," quoth she, "thou wouldst be straightLike Semele when into ashes turn'd:For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,So shines, that, were no temp'ring interpos'd,Thy mortal puissance would from its raysShrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt.Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,That underneath the burning lion's breastBeams, in this hour, commingled with his might,Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror'dThe shape, which in this mirror shall be shown."Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fedMy sight upon her blissful countenance,May know, when to new thoughts I chang'd, what joyTo do the bidding of my heav'nly guide:In equal balance poising either weight.Within the crystal, which records the name,(As its remoter circle girds the world)Of that lov'd monarch, in whose happy reignNo ill had power to harm, I saw rear'd up,In colour like to sun-illumin'd gold.A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,So lofty was the summit; down whose stepsI saw the splendours in such multitudeDescending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,Was shed thence.  As the rooks, at dawn of dayBestirring them to dry their feathers chill,Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,Returning, cross their flight, while some abideAnd wheel around their airy lodge; so seem'dThat glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,As upon certain stair it met, and clash'dIts shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'dSo bright, that in my thought: said: "The love,Which this betokens me, admits no doubt."Unwillingly from question I refrain,To her, by whom my silence and my speechAre order'd, looking for a sign: whence she,Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted meT' indulge the fervent wish; and I began:"I am not worthy, of my own desert,That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,Who hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit blest!That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,Doth the sweet symphony of ParadiseKeep silence here, pervading with such soundsOf rapt devotion ev'ry lower sphere?""Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;"Was the reply: "and what forbade the smileOf Beatrice interrupts our song.Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,And of the light that vests me, I thus farDescend these hallow'd steps: not that more loveInvites me; for lo! there aloft, as muchOr more of love is witness'd in those flames:But such my lot by charity assign'd,That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,To execute the counsel of the Highest.""That in this court," said I, "O sacred lamp!Love no compulsion needs, but follows freeTh' eternal Providence, I well discern:This harder find to deem, why of thy peersThou only to this office wert foredoom'd."I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and thenThe love, that did inhabit there, replied:"Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,Its virtue to my vision knits, and thusSupported, lifts me so above myself,That on the sov'ran essence, which it wells from,I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blazeThe keenness of my sight.  But not the soul,That is in heav'n most lustrous, nor the seraphThat hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall solveWhat thou hast ask'd: for in th' abyss it liesOf th' everlasting statute sunk so low,That no created ken may fathom it.And, to the mortal world when thou return'st,Be this reported; that none henceforth dareDirect his footsteps to so dread a bourn.The mind, that here is radiant, on the earthIs wrapt in mist.  Look then if she may do,Below, what passeth her ability,When she is ta'en to heav'n."  By words like theseAdmonish'd, I the question urg'd no more;And of the spirit humbly sued aloneT' instruct me of its state.  "'Twixt either shoreOf Italy, nor distant from thy land,A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,They call it Catria: at whose foot a cellIs sacred to the lonely Eremite,For worship set apart and holy rites."A third time thus it spake; then added: "ThereSo firmly to God's service I adher'd,That with no costlier viands than the juiceOf olives, easily I pass'd the heatsOf summer and the winter frosts, contentIn heav'n-ward musings.  Rich were the returnsAnd fertile, which that cloister once was us'dTo render to these heavens: now 't is fall'nInto a waste so empty, that ere longDetection must lay bare its vanityPietro Damiano there was I yclept:Pietro the sinner, when before I dweltBeside the Adriatic, in the houseOf our blest Lady.  Near upon my closeOf mortal life, through much importuningI was constrain'd to wear the hat that stillFrom bad to worse it shifted.--Cephas came;He came, who was the Holy Spirit's vessel,Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc'd,At the first table.  Modern Shepherd's needThose who on either hand may prop and lead them,So burly are they grown: and from behindOthers to hoist them.  Down the palfrey's sidesSpread their broad mantles, so as both the beastsAre cover'd with one skin.  O patience! thouThat lookst on this and doth endure so long."I at those accents saw the splendours downFrom step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,Each circuiting, more beautiful.  Round thisThey came, and stay'd them; uttered them a shoutSo loud, it hath no likeness here: nor IWist what it spake, so deaf'ning was the thunder.CANTO XXIIAstounded, to the guardian of my stepsI turn'd me, like the chill, who always runsThither for succour, where he trusteth most,And she was like the mother, who her sonBeholding pale and breathless, with her voiceSoothes him, and he is cheer'd; for thus she spake,Soothing me: "Know'st not thou, thou art in heav'n?And know'st not thou, whatever is in heav'n,Is holy, and that nothing there is doneBut is done zealously and well?  Deem now,What change in thee the song, and what my smilehad wrought, since thus the shout had pow'r to move thee.In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,The vengeance were already known to thee,Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,The sword of heav'n is not in haste to smite,Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,Who in desire or fear doth look for it.But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold."Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I sawA hundred little spheres, that fairer grewBy interchange of splendour.  I remain'd,As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,Abates in him the keenness of desire,Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,One largest and most lustrous onward drew,That it might yield contentment to my wish;And from within it these the sounds I heard."If thou, like me, beheldst the charityThat burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,Were utter'd.  But that, ere the lofty boundThou reach, expectance may not weary thee,I will make answer even to the thought,Which thou hast such respect of.  In old days,That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,Was on its height frequented by a raceDeceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,Who thither carried first the name of Him,Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.And such a speeding grace shone over me,That from their impious worship I reclaim'dThe dwellers round about, who with the worldWere in delusion lost.  These other flames,The spirits of men contemplative, were allEnliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly forceGives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'dWithin the cloisters, and held firm their heart."I answ'ring, thus; "Thy gentle words and kind,And this the cheerful semblance, I beholdNot unobservant, beaming in ye all,Have rais'd assurance in me, wakening itFull-blossom'd in my bosom, as a roseBefore the sun, when the consummate flowerHas spread to utmost amplitude.  Of theeTherefore entreat I, father! to declareIf I may gain such favour, as to gazeUpon thine image, by no covering veil'd.""Brother!"  he thus rejoin'd, "in the last sphereExpect completion of thy lofty aim,For there on each desire completion waits,And there on mine: where every aim is foundPerfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe.There all things are as they have ever been:For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,Our ladder reaches even to that clime,And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretchIts topmost round, when it appear'd to himWith angels laden.  But to mount it nowNone lifts his foot from earth: and hence my ruleIs left a profitless stain upon the leaves;The walls, for abbey rear'd, turned into dens,The cowls to sacks choak'd up with musty meal.Foul usury doth not more lift itselfAgainst God's pleasure, than that fruit which makesThe hearts of monks so wanton: for whate'erIs in the church's keeping, all pertains.To such, as sue for heav'n's sweet sake, and notTo those who in respect of kindred claim,Or on more vile allowance.  Mortal fleshIs grown so dainty, good beginnings last notFrom the oak's birth, unto the acorn's setting.His convent Peter founded without goldOr silver; I with pray'rs and fasting mine;And Francis his in meek humility.And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,Then look what it hath err'd to, thou shalt findThe white grown murky.  Jordan was turn'd back;And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,May at God's pleasure work amendment here."So saying, to his assembly back he drew:And they together cluster'd into one,Then all roll'd upward like an eddying wind.The sweet dame beckon'd me to follow them:And, by that influence only, so prevail'dOver my nature, that no natural motion,Ascending or descending here below,Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied.So, reader, as my hope is to returnUnto the holy triumph, for the whichI ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrustingThy finger in the fire, than I was, ereThe sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,And enter'd its precinct.  O glorious stars!O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!To whom whate'er of genius lifteth meAbove the vulgar, grateful I refer;With ye the parent of all mortal lifeArose and set, when I did first inhaleThe Tuscan air; and afterward, when graceVouchsaf'd me entrance to the lofty wheelThat in its orb impels ye, fate decreedMy passage at your clime.  To you my soulDevoutly sighs, for virtue even nowTo meet the hard emprize that draws me on."Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,"Said Beatrice, "that behooves thy kenBe vigilant and clear.  And, to this end,Or even thou advance thee further, henceLook downward, and contemplate, what a worldAlready stretched under our feet there lies:So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,Present itself to the triumphal throng,Which through the' etherial concave comes rejoicing."I straight obey'd; and with mine eye return'dThrough all the seven spheres, and saw this globeSo pitiful of semblance, that perforceIt moved my smiles: and him in truth I holdFor wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughtsElsewhere are fix'd, him worthiest call and best.I saw the daughter of Latona shineWithout the shadow, whereof late I deem'dThat dense and rare were cause.  Here I sustain'dThe visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;And mark'd, how near him with their circle, roundMove Maia and Dione; here discern'dJove's tempering 'twixt his sire and son; and henceTheir changes and their various aspectsDistinctly scann'd.  Nor might I not descryOf all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;Nor of their several distances not learn.This petty area (o'er the which we strideSo fiercely), as along the eternal twinsI wound my way, appear'd before me all,Forth from the havens stretch'd unto the hills.Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return'd.CANTO XXIIIE'en as the bird, who midst the leafy bowerHas, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,With her sweet brood, impatient to descryTheir wished looks, and to bring home their food,In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gazeExpects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,Removeth from the east her eager ken;So stood the dame erect, and bent her glanceWistfully on that region, where the sunAbateth most his speed; that, seeing herSuspense and wand'ring, I became as one,In whom desire is waken'd, and the hopeOf somewhat new to come fills with delight.Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,Long in expectance, when I saw the heav'nWax more and more resplendent; and, "Behold,"Cried Beatrice, "the triumphal hostsOf Christ, and all the harvest reap'd at lengthOf thy ascending up these spheres."  Meseem'd,That, while she spake her image all did burn,And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,In peerless beauty, 'mid th' eternal nympus,That paint through all its gulfs the blue profoundIn bright pre-eminence so saw I there,O'er million lamps a sun, from whom all drewTheir radiance as from ours the starry train:And through the living light so lustrous glow'dThe substance, that my ken endur'd it not.O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!Who cheer'd me with her comfortable words!"Against the virtue, that o'erpow'reth thee,Avails not to resist.  Here is the might,And here the wisdom, which did open layThe path, that had been yearned for so long,Betwixt the heav'n and earth."  Like to the fire,That, in a cloud imprison'd doth break outExpansive, so that from its womb enlarg'd,It falleth against nature to the ground;Thus in that heav'nly banqueting my soulOutgrew herself; and, in the transport lost.Holds now remembrance none of what she was."Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seenThings, that empower thee to sustain my smile."I was as one, when a forgotten dreamDoth come across him, and he strives in vainTo shape it in his fantasy again,Whenas that gracious boon was proffer'd me,Which never may be cancel'd from the book,Wherein the past is written.  Now were allThose tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milkOf Polyhymnia and her sisters fedAnd fatten'd, not with all their help to boot,Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.And with such figuring of ParadiseThe sacred strain must leap, like one, that meetsA sudden interruption to his road.But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,And that 't is lain upon a mortal shoulder,May pardon, if it tremble with the burden.The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooksNo unribb'd pinnace, no self-sparing pilot."Why doth my face," said Beatrice, "thusEnamour thee, as that thou dost not turnUnto the beautiful garden, blossomingBeneath the rays of Christ?  Here is the rose,Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;And here the lilies, by whose odour knownThe way of life was follow'd."  Prompt I heardHer bidding, and encounter once againThe strife of aching vision.  As erewhile,Through glance of sunlight, stream'd through broken cloud,Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,Though veil'd themselves in shade; so saw I thereLegions of splendours, on whom burning raysShed lightnings from above, yet saw I notThe fountain whence they flow'd.  O gracious virtue!Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher upThou didst exalt thy glory to give roomTo my o'erlabour'd sight: when at the nameOf that fair flower, whom duly I invokeBoth morn and eve, my soul, with all her mightCollected, on the goodliest ardour fix'd.And, as the bright dimensions of the starIn heav'n excelling, as once here on earthWere, in my eyeballs lively portray'd,Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,Circling in fashion of a diadem,And girt the star, and hov'ring round it wheel'd.Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,And draws the spirit most unto itself,Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,Compar'd unto the sounding of that lyre,Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlaysThe floor of heav'n, was crown'd. "Angelic LoveI am, who thus with hov'ring flight enwheelThe lofty rapture from that womb inspir'd,Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,Lady of Heav'n! will hover; long as thouThy Son shalt follow, and diviner joyShall from thy presence gild the highest sphere."Such close was to the circling melody:And, as it ended, all the other lightsTook up the strain, and echoed Mary's name.The robe, that with its regal folds enwrapsThe world, and with the nearer breath of GodDoth burn and quiver, held so far retir'dIts inner hem and skirting over us,That yet no glimmer of its majestyHad stream'd unto me: therefore were mine eyesUnequal to pursue the crowned flame,That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;And like to babe, that stretches forth its armsFor very eagerness towards the breast,After the milk is taken; so outstretch'dTheir wavy summits all the fervent band,Through zealous love to Mary: then in viewThere halted, and "Regina Coeli" sangSo sweetly, the delight hath left me never.O what o'erflowing plenty is up-pil'dIn those rich-laden coffers, which belowSow'd the good seed, whose harvest now they keep.Here are the treasures tasted, that with tearsWere in the Babylonian exile won,When gold had fail'd them.  Here in synod highOf ancient council with the new conven'd,Under the Son of Mary and of God,Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,To whom the keys of glory were assign'd.CANTO XXIV"O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc'dTo the great supper of the blessed Lamb,Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill'd!If to this man through God's grace be vouchsaf'dForetaste of that, which from your table falls,Or ever death his fated term prescribe;Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;But may some influence of your sacred dewsSprinkle him.  Of the fount ye alway drink,Whence flows what most he craves."  Beatrice spake,And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheresOn firm-set poles revolving, trail'd a blazeOf comet splendour; and as wheels, that windTheir circles in the horologe, so workThe stated rounds, that to th' observant eyeThe first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;E'en thus their carols weaving variously,They by the measure pac'd, or swift, or slow,Made me to rate the riches of their joy.From that, which I did note in beauty mostExcelling, saw I issue forth a flameSo bright, as none was left more goodly there.Round Beatrice thrice it wheel'd about,With so divine a song, that fancy's earRecords it not; and the pen passeth onAnd leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,Nor e'en the inward shaping of the brain,Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds."O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devoutIs with so vehement affection urg'd,Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere."Such were the accents towards my lady breath'dFrom that blest ardour, soon as it was stay'd:To whom she thus: "O everlasting lightOf him, within whose mighty grasp our LordDid leave the keys, which of this wondrous blissHe bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,By the which thou didst on the billows walk.If he in love, in hope, and in belief,Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thouHast there thy ken, where all things are beheldIn liveliest portraiture.  But since true faithHas peopled this fair realm with citizens,Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse."Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,And speaks not, till the master have propos'dThe question, to approve, and not to end it;So I, in silence, arm'd me, while she spake,Summoning up each argument to aid;As was behooveful for such questioner,And such profession: "As good Christian ought,Declare thee, What is faith?"  Whereat I rais'dMy forehead to the light, whence this had breath'd,Then turn'd to Beatrice, and in her looksApproval met, that from their inmost fountI should unlock the waters.  "May the grace,That giveth me the captain of the churchFor confessor," said I, "vouchsafe to meApt utterance for my thoughts!" then added: "Sire!E'en as set down by the unerring styleOf thy dear brother, who with thee conspir'dTo bring Rome in unto the way of life,Faith of things hop'd is substance, and the proofOf things not seen; and herein doth consistMethinks its essence,"--"Rightly hast thou deem'd,"Was answer'd: "if thou well discern, why firstHe hath defin'd it, substance, and then proof.""The deep things," I replied, "which here I scanDistinctly, are below from mortal eyeSo hidden, they have in belief aloneTheir being, on which credence hope sublimeIs built; and therefore substance it intends.And inasmuch as we must needs inferFrom such belief our reasoning, all respectTo other view excluded, hence of proofTh' intention is deriv'd."  Forthwith I heard:"If thus, whate'er by learning men attain,Were understood, the sophist would want roomTo exercise his wit."  So breath'd the flameOf love: then added: "Current is the coinThou utter'st, both in weight and in alloy.But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.""Even so glittering and so round," said I,"I not a whit misdoubt of its assay."Next issued from the deep imbosom'd splendour:"Say, whence the costly jewel, on the whichIs founded every virtue, came to thee.""The flood," I answer'd, "from the Spirit of GodRain'd down upon the ancient bond and new,--Here is the reas'ning, that convinceth meSo feelingly, each argument besideSeems blunt and forceless in comparison."Then heard I: "Wherefore holdest thou that each,The elder proposition and the new,Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav'n?""The works, that follow'd, evidence their truth;"I answer'd: "Nature did not make for theseThe iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.""Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,"Was the reply, "that they in very deedAre that they purport?  None hath sworn so to thee.""That all the world," said I, "should have been turn'dTo Christian, and no miracle been wrought,Would in itself be such a miracle,The rest were not an hundredth part so great.E'en thou wentst forth in poverty and hungerTo set the goodly plant, that from the vine,It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble."That ended, through the high celestial courtResounded all the spheres.  "Praise we one God!"In song of most unearthly melody.And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,Examining, had led me, that we nowApproach'd the topmost bough, he straight resum'd;"The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos'dThat, whatsoe'er has past them, I commend.Behooves thee to express, what thou believ'st,The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown.""O saintly sire and spirit!" I began,"Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,Toward the sepulchre?  thy will is here,That I the tenour of my creed unfold;And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask'd.And I reply: I in one God believe,One sole eternal Godhead, of whose loveAll heav'n is mov'd, himself unmov'd the while.Nor demonstration physical alone,Or more intelligential and abstruse,Persuades me to this faith; but from that truthIt cometh to me rather, which is shedThrough Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms.The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.In three eternal Persons I believe,Essence threefold and one, mysterious leagueOf union absolute, which, many a time,The word of gospel lore upon my mindImprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,The lively flame dilates, and like heav'n's starDoth glitter in me."  As the master hears,Well pleas'd, and then enfoldeth in his armsThe servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,And having told the errand keeps his peace;Thus benediction uttering with songSoon as my peace I held, compass'd me thriceThe apostolic radiance, whose behestHad op'd lips; so well their answer pleas'd.CANTO XXVIf e'er the sacred poem that hath madeBoth heav'n and earth copartners in its toil,And with lean abstinence, through many a year,Faded my brow, be destin'd to prevailOver the cruelty, which bars me forthOf the fair sheep-fold, where a sleeping lambThe wolves set on and fain had worried me,With other voice and fleece of other grainI shall forthwith return, and, standing upAt my baptismal font, shall claim the wreathDue to the poet's temples: for I thereFirst enter'd on the faith which maketh soulsAcceptable to God: and, for its sake,Peter had then circled my forehead thus.Next from the squadron, whence had issued forthThe first fruit of Christ's vicars on the earth,Toward us mov'd a light, at view whereofMy Lady, full of gladness, spake to me:"Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might,That makes Falicia throng'd with visitants!"As when the ring-dove by his mate alights,In circles each about the other wheels,And murmuring cooes his fondness; thus saw IOne, of the other great and glorious prince,With kindly greeting hail'd, extolling bothTheir heavenly banqueting; but when an endWas to their gratulation, silent, each,Before me sat they down, so burning bright,I could not look upon them.  Smiling then,Beatrice spake: "O life in glory shrin'd!"Who didst the largess of our kingly courtSet down with faithful pen! let now thy voiceOf hope the praises in this height resound.For thou, who figur'st them in shapes, as clear,As Jesus stood before thee, well can'st speak them.""Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:For that, which hither from the mortal worldArriveth, must be ripen'd in our beam."Such cheering accents from the second flameAssur'd me; and mine eyes I lifted upUnto the mountains that had bow'd them lateWith over-heavy burden.  "Sith our LiegeWills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,In the most secret council, with his lordsShouldst be confronted, so that having view'dThe glories of our court, thou mayst therewithThyself, and all who hear, invigorateWith hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,And whence thou hadst it?"  Thus proceeding still,The second light: and she, whose gentle loveMy soaring pennons in that lofty flightEscorted, thus preventing me, rejoin'd:Among her sons, not one more full of hope,Hath the church militant: so 't is of himRecorded in the sun, whose liberal orbEnlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his termOf warfare, hence permitted he is come,From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see.The other points, both which thou hast inquir'd,Not for more knowledge, but that he may tellHow dear thou holdst the virtue, these to himLeave I; for he may answer thee with ease,And without boasting, so God give him grace."Like to the scholar, practis'd in his task,Who, willing to give proof of diligence,Seconds his teacher gladly, "Hope," said I,"Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,Th' effect of grace divine and merit preceding.This light from many a star visits my heart,But flow'd to me the first from him, who sangThe songs of the Supreme, himself supremeAmong his tuneful brethren.  'Let all hopeIn thee,' so speak his anthem, 'who have knownThy name;' and with my faith who know not that?From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,In thine epistle, fell on me the dropsSo plenteously, that I on others showerThe influence of their dew."  Whileas I spake,A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,Play'd tremulous; then forth these accents breath'd:"Love for the virtue which attended meE'en to the palm, and issuing from the field,Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspiresTo ask of thee, whom also it delights;What promise thou from hope in chief dost win.""Both scriptures, new and ancient," I reply'd;"Propose the mark (which even now I view)For souls belov'd of God. Isaias saith,That, in their own land, each one must be cladIn twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.In terms more full,And clearer far, thy brother hath set forthThis revelation to us, where he tellsOf the white raiment destin'd to the saints."And, as the words were ending, from above,"They hope in thee," first heard we cried: wheretoAnswer'd the carols all.  Amidst them next,A light of so clear amplitude emerg'd,That winter's month were but a single day,Were such a crystal in the Cancer's sign.Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,And enters on the mazes of the dance,Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,Than to do fitting honour to the bride;So I beheld the new effulgence comeUnto the other two, who in a ringWheel'd, as became their rapture.  In the danceAnd in the song it mingled.  And the dameHeld on them fix'd her looks: e'en as the spouseSilent and moveless.  "This is he, who layUpon the bosom of our pelican:This he, into whose keeping from the crossThe mighty charge was given."  Thus she spake,Yet therefore naught the more remov'd her SightFrom marking them, or ere her words began,Or when they clos'd.  As he, who looks intent,And strives with searching ken, how he may seeThe sun in his eclipse, and, through desireOf seeing, loseth power of sight: so IPeer'd on that last resplendence, while I heard:"Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,Which here abides not?  Earth my body is,In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,As till our number equal the decreeOf the Most High.  The two that have ascended,In this our blessed cloister, shine aloneWith the two garments.  So report below."As when, for ease of labour, or to shunSuspected peril at a whistle's breath,The oars, erewhile dash'd frequent in the wave,All rest; the flamy circle at that voiceSo rested, and the mingling sound was still,Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.I turn'd, but ah! how trembled in my thought,When, looking at my side again to seeBeatrice, I descried her not, althoughNot distant, on the happy coast she stood.CANTO XXVIWith dazzled eyes, whilst wond'ring I remain'd,Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,Issued a breath, that in attention muteDetain'd me; and these words it spake: "'T were well,That, long as till thy vision, on my formO'erspent, regain its virtue, with discourseThou compensate the brief delay.  Say then,Beginning, to what point thy soul aspires:"And meanwhile rest assur'd, that sight in theeIs but o'erpowered a space, not wholly quench'd:Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her lookHath potency, the like to that which dweltIn Ananias' hand." I answering thus:"Be to mine eyes the remedy or lateOr early, at her pleasure; for they wereThe gates, at which she enter'd, and did lightHer never dying fire.  My wishes hereAre centered; in this palace is the weal,That Alpha and Omega, is to allThe lessons love can read me."  Yet againThe voice which had dispers'd my fear, when daz'dWith that excess, to converse urg'd, and spake:"Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,And say, who level'd at this scope thy bow.""Philosophy," said I, ''hath arguments,And this place hath authority enough'T' imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good,Kindles our love, and in degree the more,As it comprises more of goodness in 't.The essence then, where such advantage is,That each good, found without it, is naught elseBut of his light the beam, must needs attractThe soul of each one, loving, who the truthDiscerns, on which this proof is built.  Such truthLearn I from him, who shows me the first loveOf all intelligential substancesEternal: from his voice I learn, whose wordIs truth, that of himself to Moses saith,'I will make all my good before thee pass.'Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim'st,E'en at the outset of thy heralding,In mortal ears the mystery of heav'n.""Through human wisdom, and th' authorityTherewith agreeing," heard I answer'd, "keepThe choicest of thy love for God.  But say,If thou yet other cords within thee feel'stThat draw thee towards him; so that thou reportHow many are the fangs, with which this loveIs grappled to thy soul."  I did not miss,To what intent the eagle of our LordHad pointed his demand; yea noted wellTh' avowal, which he led to; and resum'd:"All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,Confederate to make fast our clarity.The being of the world, and mine own being,The death which he endur'd that I should live,And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,To the foremention'd lively knowledge join'd,Have from the sea of ill love sav'd my bark,And on the coast secur'd it of the right.As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,My love for them is great, as is the goodDealt by th' eternal hand, that tends them all."I ended, and therewith a song most sweetRang through the spheres; and "Holy, holy, holy,"Accordant with the rest my lady sang.And as a sleep is broken and dispers'dThrough sharp encounter of the nimble light,With the eye's spirit running forth to meetThe ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg'd;And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees;So, at his sudden waking, he misdeemsOf all around him, till assurance waitsOn better judgment: thus the saintly cameDrove from before mine eyes the motes away,With the resplendence of her own, that castTheir brightness downward, thousand miles below.Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,Recover'd; and, well nigh astounded, ask'dOf a fourth light, that now with us I saw.And Beatrice: "The first diving soul,That ever the first virtue fram'd, admiresWithin these rays his Maker."  Like the leaf,That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;By its own virtue rear'd then stands aloof;So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow'd.Then eagerness to speak embolden'd me;And I began: "O fruit! that wast aloneMature, when first engender'd!  Ancient father!That doubly seest in every wedded brideThy daughter by affinity and blood!Devoutly as I may, I pray thee holdConverse with me: my will thou seest; and I,More speedily to hear thee, tell it not."It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,Through the sleek cov'ring of his furry coat.The fondness, that stirs in him and conformsHis outside seeming to the cheer within:And in like guise was Adam's spirit mov'dTo joyous mood, that through the covering shone,Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:"No need thy will be told, which I untoldBetter discern, than thou whatever thingThou holdst most certain: for that will I seeIn Him, who is truth's mirror, and HimselfParhelion unto all things, and naught elseTo him.  This wouldst thou hear; how long since GodPlac'd me high garden, from whose houndsShe led me up in this ladder, steep and long;What space endur'd my season of delight;Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish'd me;And what the language, which I spake and fram'dNot that I tasted of the tree, my son,Was in itself the cause of that exile,But only my transgressing of the markAssign'd me.  There, whence at thy lady's hestThe Mantuan mov'd him, still was I debarr'dThis council, till the sun had made complete,Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,His annual journey; and, through every lightIn his broad pathway, saw I him return,Thousand save sev'nty times, the whilst I dweltUpon the earth.  The language I did useWas worn away, or ever Nimrod's raceTheir unaccomplishable work began.For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,Left by his reason free, and variable,As is the sky that sways him.  That he speaks,Is nature's prompting: whether thus or thus,She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it.Ere I descended into hell's abyss,El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then 't was call'dAnd so beseemeth: for, in mortals, useIs as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,And other comes instead.  Upon the mountMost high above the waters, all my life,Both innocent and guilty, did but reachFrom the first hour, to that which cometh next(As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth."CANTO XXVIIThen  "Glory to the Father, to the Son,And to the Holy Spirit," rang aloudThroughout all Paradise, that with the songMy spirit reel'd, so passing sweet the strain:And what I saw was equal ecstasy;One universal smile it seem'd of all things,Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,Imperishable life of peace and love,Exhaustless riches and unmeasur'd bliss.Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit;And that, which first had come, began to waxIn brightness, and in semblance such became,As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,And interchang'd their plumes.  Silence ensued,Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appointsVicissitude of ministry, enjoin'd;When thus I heard: "Wonder not, if my hueBe chang'd; for, while I speak, these shalt thou seeAll in like manner change with me.  My placeHe who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,Which in the presence of the Son of GodIs void), the same hath made my cemeteryA common sewer of puddle and of blood:The more below his triumph, who from henceMalignant fell."  Such colour, as the sun,At eve or morning, paints an adverse cloud,Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.And as th' unblemish'd dame, who in herselfSecure of censure, yet at bare reportOf other's failing, shrinks with maiden fear;So Beatrice in her semblance chang'd:And such eclipse in heav'n methinks was seen,When the Most Holy suffer'd.  Then the wordsProceeded, with voice, alter'd from itselfSo clean, the semblance did not alter more."Not to this end was Christ's spouse with my blood,With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:That she might serve for purchase of base gold:But for the purchase of this happy lifeDid Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,And Urban, they, whose doom was not withoutMuch weeping seal'd.  No purpose was of ourThat on the right hand of our successorsPart of the Christian people should be set,And part upon their left; nor that the keys,Which were vouchsaf'd me, should for ensign serveUnto the banners, that do levy warOn the baptiz'd: nor I, for sigil-markSet upon sold and lying privileges;Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red.In shepherd's clothing greedy wolves belowRange wide o'er all the pastures.  Arm of God!Why longer sleepst thou?  Caorsines and GasconaPrepare to quaff our blood.  O good beginningTo what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!But the high providence, which did defendThrough Scipio the world's glory unto Rome,Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,Who through thy mortal weight shall yet againReturn below, open thy lips, nor hideWhat is by me not hidden."  As a HoodOf frozen vapours streams adown the air,What time the she-goat with her skiey hornTouches the sun; so saw I there stream wideThe vapours, who with us had linger'd lateAnd with glad triumph deck th' ethereal cope.Onward my sight their semblances pursued;So far pursued, as till the space betweenFrom its reach sever'd them: whereat the guideCelestial, marking me no more intentOn upward gazing, said, "Look down and seeWhat circuit thou hast compass'd."  From the hourWhen I before had cast my view beneath,All the first region overpast I saw,Which from the midmost to the bound'ry winds;That onward thence from Gades I beheldThe unwise passage of Laertes' son,And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!Mad'st thee a joyful burden: and yet moreOf this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,A constellation off and more, had ta'enHis progress in the zodiac underneath.Then by the spirit, that doth never leaveIts amorous dalliance with my lady's looks,Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyesLed unto her: and from her radiant smiles,Whenas I turn'd me, pleasure so divineDid lighten on me, that whatever baitOr art or nature in the human flesh,Or in its limn'd resemblance, can combineThrough greedy eyes to take the soul withal,Were to her beauty nothing.  Its boon influenceFrom the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,And wafted on into the swiftest heav'n.What place for entrance Beatrice chose,I may not say, so uniform was all,Liveliest and loftiest.  She my secret wishDivin'd; and with such gladness, that God's loveSeem'd from her visage shining, thus began:"Here is the goal, whence motion on his raceStarts; motionless the centre, and the restAll mov'd around.  Except the soul divine,Place in this heav'n is none, the soul divine,Wherein the love, which ruleth o'er its orb,Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;One circle, light and love, enclasping it,As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,Who draws the bound, its limit only known.Measur'd itself by none, it doth divideMotion to all, counted unto them forth,As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.The vase, wherein time's roots are plung'd, thou seest,Look elsewhere for the leaves.  O mortal lust!That canst not lift thy head above the wavesWhich whelm and sink thee down!  The will in manBears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promiseIs, by the dripping of perpetual rain,Made mere abortion: faith and innocenceAre met with but in babes, each taking leaveEre cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let looseGluts every food alike in every moon.One yet a babbler, loves and listens toHis mother; but no sooner hath free useOf speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.So suddenly doth the fair child of him,Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,To negro blackness change her virgin white."Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that noneBears rule in earth, and its frail familyAre therefore wand'rers.  Yet before the date,When through the hundredth in his reck'ning dropsPale January must be shor'd asideFrom winter's calendar, these heav'nly spheresShall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fainTo turn the poop, where she hath now the prow;So that the fleet run onward; and true fruit,Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom!"CANTO XXVIISo she who doth imparadise my soul,Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life,And bar'd the truth of poor mortality;When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spiesThe shining of a flambeau at his back,Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,And turneth to resolve him, if the glassHave told him true, and sees the record faithfulAs note is to its metre; even thus,I well remember, did befall to me,Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence loveHad made the leash to take me.  As I turn'd;And that, which, in their circles, none who spies,Can miss of, in itself apparent, struckOn mine; a point I saw, that darted lightSo sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear upAgainst its keenness.  The least star we viewFrom hence, had seem'd a moon, set by its side,As star by side of star.  And so far off,Perchance, as is the halo from the lightWhich paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,There wheel'd about the point a circle of fire,More rapid than the motion, which first girdsThe world.  Then, circle after circle, roundEnring'd each other; till the seventh reach'dCircumference so ample, that its bow,Within the span of Juno's messenger,lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev'nth,Follow'd yet other two.  And every one,As more in number distant from the first,Was tardier in motion; and that glow'dWith flame most pure, that to the sparkle' of truthWas nearest, as partaking most, methinks,Of its reality.  The guide belov'dSaw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:"Heav'n, and all nature, hangs upon that point.The circle thereto most conjoin'd observe;And know, that by intenser love its courseIs to this swiftness wing'd."  To whom I thus:"It were enough; nor should I further seek,Had I but witness'd order, in the worldAppointed, such as in these wheels is seen.But in the sensible world such diff'rence is,That is each round shows more divinity,As each is wider from the centre.  Hence,If in this wondrous and angelic temple,That hath for confine only light and love,My wish may have completion I must know,Wherefore such disagreement is betweenTh' exemplar and its copy: for myself,Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.""It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil'dDo leave the knot untied: so hard 't is grownFor want of tenting."  Thus she said: "But take,"She added, "if thou wish thy cure, my words,And entertain them subtly.  Every orbCorporeal, doth proportion its extentUnto the virtue through its parts diffus'd.The greater blessedness preserves the more.The greater is the body (if all partsShare equally) the more is to preserve.Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheelsThe universal frame answers to that,Which is supreme in knowledge and in loveThus by the virtue, not the seeming, breadthOf substance, measure, thou shalt see the heav'ns,Each to the' intelligence that ruleth it,Greater to more, and smaller unto less,Suited in strict and wondrous harmony."As when the sturdy north blows from his cheekA blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air,Clear'd of the rack, that hung on it before,Glitters; and, With his beauties all unveil'd,The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles;Such was my cheer, when Beatrice droveWith clear reply the shadows back, and truthWas manifested, as a star in heaven.And when the words were ended, not unlikeTo iron in the furnace, every cirqueEbullient shot forth scintillating fires:And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,In number did outmillion the accountReduplicate upon the chequer'd board.Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,"Hosanna," to the fixed point, that holds,And shall for ever hold them to their place,From everlasting, irremovable.Musing awhile I stood: and she, who sawby inward meditations, thus began:"In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,Are seraphim and cherubim.  Thus swiftFollow their hoops, in likeness to the point,Near as they can, approaching; and they canThe more, the loftier their vision.  Those,That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,Are thrones; in whom the first trine ends.  And allAre blessed, even as their sight descendsDeeper into the truth, wherein rest isFor every mind.  Thus happiness hath rootIn seeing, not in  loving, which of sightIs aftergrowth.  And of the seeing suchThe meed, as unto each in due degreeGrace and good-will their measure have assign'd.The other trine, that with still opening budsIn this eternal springtide blossom fair,Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,Breathe up in warbled melodies threefoldHosannas blending ever, from the threeTransmitted. hierarchy of gods, for ayeRejoicing, dominations first, next thenVirtues, and powers the third.  The next to whomAre princedoms and archangels, with glad roundTo tread their festal ring; and last the bandAngelical, disporting in their sphere.All, as they circle in their orders, lookAloft, and downward with such sway prevail,That all with mutual impulse tend to God.These once a mortal view beheld.  DesireIn Dionysius so intently wrought,That he, as I have done rang'd them; and nam'dTheir orders, marshal'd in his thought.  From himDissentient, one refus'd his sacred read.But soon as in this heav'n his doubting eyesWere open'd, Gregory at his error smil'dNor marvel, that a denizen of earthShould scan such secret truth; for he had learntBoth this and much beside of these our orbs,From an eye-witness to heav'n's mysteries."CANTO XXIXNo longer than what time Latona's twinsCover'd of Libra and the fleecy star,Together both, girding the' horizon hang,In even balance from the zenith pois'd,Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,Part the nice level; e'en so brief a spaceDid Beatrice's silence hold.  A smileBat painted on her cheek; and her fix'd gazeBent on the point, at which my vision fail'd:When thus her words resuming she began:"I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;For I have mark'd it, where all time and placeAre present.  Not for increase to himselfOf good, which may not be increas'd, but forthTo manifest his glory by its beams,Inhabiting his own eternity,Beyond time's limit or what bound soe'erTo circumscribe his being, as he will'd,Into new natures, like unto himself,Eternal Love unfolded.  Nor before,As if in dull inaction torpid lay.For not in process of before or aftUpon these waters mov'd the Spirit of God.Simple and mix'd, both form and substance, forthTo perfect being started, like three dartsShot from a bow three-corded.  And as rayIn crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,E'en at the moment of its issuing; thusDid, from th' eternal Sovran, beam entireHis threefold operation, at one actProduc'd coeval.  Yet in order eachCreated his due station knew: those highest,Who pure intelligence were made: mere powerThe lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,Intelligence and power, unsever'd bond.Long tract of ages by the angels past,Ere the creating of another world,Describ'd on Jerome's pages thou hast seen.But that what I disclose to thee is true,Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov'dIn many a passage of their sacred bookAttest; as thou by diligent search shalt findAnd reason in some sort discerns the same,Who scarce would grant the heav'nly ministersOf their perfection void, so long a space.Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,Thou know'st, and how: and knowing hast allay'dThy thirst, which from the triple question rose.Ere one had reckon'd twenty, e'en so soonPart of the angels fell: and in their fallConfusion to your elements ensued.The others kept their station: and this task,Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,That they surcease not ever, day nor night,Their circling.  Of that fatal lapse the causeWas the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seenPent with the world's incumbrance.  Those, whom hereThou seest, were lowly to confess themselvesOf his free bounty, who had made them aptFor ministries so high: therefore their viewsWere by enlight'ning grace and their own meritExalted; so that in their will confirm'dThey stand, nor feel to fall.  For do not doubt,But to receive the grace, which heav'n vouchsafes,Is meritorious, even as the soulWith prompt affection welcometh the guest.Now, without further help, if with good heedMy words thy mind have treasur'd, thou henceforthThis consistory round about mayst scan,And gaze thy fill.  But since thou hast on earthHeard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,Canvas the' angelic nature, and disputeIts powers of apprehension, memory, choice;Therefore, 't is well thou take from me the truth,Pure and without disguise, which they below,Equivocating, darken and perplex."Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,Rejoicing in the countenance of God,Have held unceasingly their view, intentUpon the glorious vision, from the whichNaught absent is nor hid: where then no changeOf newness with succession interrupts,Remembrance there needs none to gather upDivided thought and images remote"So that men, thus at variance with the truthDream, though their eyes be open; reckless someOf error; others well aware they err,To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.Each the known track of sage philosophyDeserts, and has a byway of his own:So much the restless eagerness to shineAnd love of singularity prevail.Yet this, offensive as it is, provokesHeav'n's anger less, than when the book of GodIs forc'd to yield to man's authority,Or from its straightness warp'd: no reck'ning madeWhat blood the sowing of it in the worldHas cost; what favour for himself he wins,Who meekly clings to it.  The aim of allIs how to shine: e'en they, whose office isTo preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,And pass their own inventions off instead.One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan moonBent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sunWith intervenient disk, as she withdrew:Another, how the light shrouded itselfWithin its tabernacle, and left darkThe Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew.Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,Bandied about more frequent, than the namesOf Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, returnFrom pasture, fed with wind: and what availsFor their excuse, they do not see their harm?Christ said not to his first conventicle,'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'But gave them truth to build on; and the soundWas mighty on their lips; nor needed they,Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,To aid them in their warfare for the faith.The preacher now provides himself with storeOf jests and gibes; and, so there be no lackOf laughter, while he vents them, his big cowlDistends, and he has won the meed he sought:Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the whileOf that dark bird which nestles in his hood,They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,That every counterfeit, who spreads abroadThe hands of holy promise, finds a throngOf credulous fools beneath.  Saint AnthonyFattens with this his swine, and others worseThan swine, who diet at his lazy board,Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare."But (for we far have wander'd) let us seekThe forward path again; so as the wayBe shorten'd with the time.  No mortal tongueNor thought of man hath ever reach'd so far,That of these natures he might count the tribes.What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'dWith finite number infinite conceals.The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,With light supplies them in as many modes,As there are splendours, that it shines on: eachAccording to the virtue it conceives,Differing in love and sweet affection.Look then how lofty and how huge in breadthThe' eternal might, which, broken and dispers'dOver such countless mirrors, yet remainsWhole in itself and one, as at the first."CANTO XXXNoon's fervid hour perchance six thousand milesFrom hence is distant; and the shadowy coneAlmost to level on our earth declines;When from the midmost of this blue abyssBy turns some star is to our vision lost.And straightway as the handmaid of the sunPuts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light,Fade, and the spangled firmament shuts in,E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng.Thus vanish'd gradually from my sightThe triumph, which plays ever round the point,That overcame me, seeming (for it did)Engirt by that it girdeth.  Wherefore love,With loss of other object, forc'd me bendMine eyes on Beatrice once again.If all, that hitherto is told of her,Were in one praise concluded, 't were too weakTo furnish out this turn.  Mine eyes did lookOn beauty, such, as I believe in sooth,Not merely to exceed our human, but,That save its Maker, none can to the fullEnjoy it.  At this point o'erpower'd I fail,Unequal to my theme, as never bardOf buskin or of sock hath fail'd before.For, as the sun doth to the feeblest sight,E'en so remembrance of that witching smileHath dispossess my spirit of itself.Not from that day, when on this earth I firstBeheld her charms, up to that view of them,Have I with song applausive ever ceas'dTo follow, but not follow them no more;My course here bounded, as each artist's is,When it doth touch the limit of his skill.She (such as I bequeath her to the bruitOf louder trump than mine, which hasteneth on,Urging its arduous matter to the close),Her words resum'd, in gesture and in voiceResembling one accustom'd to command:"Forth from the last corporeal are we comeInto the heav'n, that is unbodied light,Light intellectual replete with love,Love of true happiness replete with joy,Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight.Here shalt thou look on either mighty hostOf Paradise; and one in that array,Which in the final judgment thou shalt see."As when the lightning, in a sudden spleenUnfolded, dashes from the blinding eyesThe visive spirits dazzled and bedimm'd;So, round about me, fulminating streamsOf living radiance play'd, and left me swath'dAnd veil'd in dense impenetrable blaze.Such weal is in the love, that stills this heav'n;For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!No sooner to my list'ning ear had comeThe brief assurance, than I understoodNew virtue into me infus'd, and sightKindled afresh, with vigour to sustainExcess of light, however pure.  I look'd;And in the likeness of a river sawLight flowing, from whose amber-seeming wavesFlash'd up effulgence, as they glided on'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,There ever and anon, outstarting, flewSparkles instinct with life; and in the flow'rsDid set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;Then, as if drunk with odors, plung'd againInto the wondrous flood; from which, as oneRe'enter'd, still another rose.  "The thirstOf knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam'd,To search the meaning of what here thou seest,The more it warms thee, pleases me the more.But first behooves thee of this water drink,Or ere that longing be allay'd."  So spakeThe day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin'd:"This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,And diving back, a living topaz each,With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,Are but a preface, shadowy of the truthThey emblem: not that, in themselves, the thingsAre crude; but on thy part is the defect,For that thy views not yet aspire so high."Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,As I toward the water, bending me,To make the better mirrors of mine eyesIn the refining wave; and, as the eavesOf mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwithSeem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round,Then as a troop of maskers, when they putTheir vizors off, look other than before,The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;So into greater jubilee were chang'dThose flowers and sparkles, and distinct I sawBefore me either court of heav'n displac'd.O prime enlightener! thou who crav'st me strengthOn the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd,    There is in heav'n a light, whose goodly shineMakes the Creator visible to allCreated, that in seeing him aloneHave peace; and in a circle spreads so far,That the circumference were too loose a zoneTo girdle in the sun.  All is one beam,Reflected from the summit of the first,That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyesIts image mirror'd in the crystal flood,As if 't admire its brave apparelingOf verdure and of flowers: so, round about,Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,Stood, eminent, whatever from our earthHas to the skies return'd.  How wide the leavesExtended to their utmost of this rose,Whose lowest step embosoms such a spaceOf ample radiance!  Yet, nor amplitudeNor height impeded, but my view with easeTook in the full dimensions of that joy.Near or remote, what there avails, where GodImmediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspendsHer sway?  Into the yellow of the rosePerennial, which in bright expansiveness,Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolentOf praises to the never-wint'ring sun,As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,Beatrice led me; and, "Behold," she said,"This fair assemblage! stoles of snowy whiteHow numberless!  The city, where we dwell,Behold how vast! and these our seats so throng'dFew now are wanting here!  In that proud stall,On which, the crown, already o'er its stateSuspended, holds thine eyes--or ere thyselfMayst at the wedding sup,--shall rest the soulOf the great Harry, he who, by the worldAugustas hail'd, to Italy must come,Before her day be ripe.  But ye are sick,And in your tetchy wantonness as blind,As is the bantling, that of hunger dies,And drives away the nurse.  Nor may it be,That he, who in the sacred forum sways,Openly or in secret, shall with himAccordant walk: Whom God will not endureI' th' holy office long; but thrust him downTo Simon Magus, where Magna's priestWill sink beneath him: such will be his meed."CANTO XXXIIn fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay thenBefore my view the saintly multitude,Which in his own blood Christ espous'd.  MeanwhileThat other host, that soar aloft to gazeAnd celebrate his glory, whom they love,Hover'd around; and, like a troop of bees,Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,Flew downward to the mighty flow'r, or roseFrom the redundant petals, streaming backUnto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;The rest was whiter than the driven snow.And as they flitted down into the flower,From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,Whisper'd the peace and ardour, which they wonFrom that soft winnowing.  Shadow none, the vastInterposition of such numerous flightCast, from above, upon the flower, or viewObstructed aught.  For, through the universe,Wherever merited, celestial lightGlides freely, and no obstacle prevents.All there, who reign in safety and in bliss,Ages long past or new, on one sole markTheir love and vision fix'd.  O trinal beamOf individual star, that charmst them thus,Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below!If the grim brood, from Arctic shores that roam'd,(Where helice, forever, as she wheels,Sparkles a mother's fondness on her son)Stood in mute wonder 'mid the works of Rome,When to their view the Lateran aroseIn greatness more than earthly; I, who thenFrom human to divine had past, from timeUnto eternity, and out of FlorenceTo justice and to truth, how might I chooseBut marvel too?  'Twixt gladness and amaze,In sooth no will had I to utter aught,Or hear.  And, as a pilgrim, when he restsWithin the temple of his vow, looks roundIn breathless awe, and hopes some time to tellOf all its goodly state: e'en so mine eyesCours'd up and down along the living light,Now low, and now aloft, and now around,Visiting every step.  Looks I beheld,Where charity in soft persuasion sat,Smiles from within and radiance from above,And in each gesture grace and honour high.So rov'd my ken, and its general formAll Paradise survey'd: when round I turn'dWith purpose of my lady to inquireOnce more of things, that held my thought suspense,But answer found from other than I ween'd;For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,I saw instead a senior, at my side, Rob'd, as the rest, in glory.  Joy benignGlow'd in his eye, and o'er his cheek diffus'd,With gestures such as spake a father's love.And, "Whither is she vanish'd?"  straight I ask'd."By Beatrice summon'd," he replied,"I come to aid thy wish.  Looking aloftTo the third circle from the highest, thereBehold her on the throne, wherein her meritHath plac'd her."  Answering not, mine eyes I rais'd,And saw her, where aloof she sat, her browA wreath reflecting of eternal beams.Not from the centre of the sea so farUnto the region of the highest thunder,As was my ken from hers; and yet the formCame through that medium down, unmix'd and pure,"O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!Who, for my safety, hast not scorn'd, in hellTo leave the traces of thy footsteps mark'd!For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy powerAnd goodness, virtue owe and grace.  Of slave,Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,Is loosen'd from this body, it may findFavour with thee."  So I my suit preferr'd:And she, so distant, as appear'd, look'd down,And smil'd; then tow'rds th' eternal fountain turn'd.And thus the senior, holy and rever'd:"That thou at length mayst happily concludeThy voyage (to which end I was dispatch'd,By supplication mov'd and holy love)Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,This garden through: for so, by ray divineKindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;And from heav'n's queen, whom fervent I adore,All gracious aid befriend us; for that IAm her own faithful Bernard."  Like a wight,Who haply from Croatia wends to seeOur Veronica, and the while 't is shown,Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,And, all that he hath heard revolving, saithUnto himself in thought: "And didst thou lookE'en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?And was this semblance thine?"  So gaz'd I thenAdoring; for the charity of him,Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy'd,Stood lively before me.  "Child of grace!"Thus he began: "thou shalt not knowledge gainOf this glad being, if thine eyes are heldStill in this depth below.  But search aroundThe circles, to the furthest, till thou spySeated in state, the queen, that of this realmIs sovran."  Straight mine eyes I rais'd; and bright,As, at the birth of morn, the eastern climeAbove th' horizon, where the sun declines;To mine eyes, that upward, as from valeTo mountain sped, at th' extreme bound, a partExcell'd in lustre all the front oppos'd.And as the glow burns ruddiest o'er the wave,That waits the sloping beam, which PhaetonIll knew to guide, and on each part the lightDiminish'd fades, intensest in the midst;So burn'd the peaceful oriflame, and slack'dOn every side the living flame decay'd.And in that midst their sportive pennons wav'dThousands of angels; in resplendence eachDistinct, and quaint adornment. At their gleeAnd carol, smil'd the Lovely One of heav'n,That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,As is the colouring in fancy's loom,'T were all too poor to utter the least partOf that enchantment.  When he saw mine eyesIntent on her, that charm'd him, Bernard gaz'dWith so exceeding fondness, as infus'dArdour into my breast, unfelt before.CANTO XXXIIFreely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,Assum'd the teacher's part, and mild began:"The wound, that Mary clos'd, she open'd first,Who sits so beautiful at Mary's feet.The third in order, underneath her, lo!Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songsOf sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,Are in gradation throned on the rose.And from the seventh step, successively,Adown the breathing tresses of the flow'rStill doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.For these are a partition wall, wherebyThe sacred stairs are sever'd, as the faithIn Christ divides them.  On this part, where bloomsEach leaf in full maturity, are setSuch as in Christ, or ere he came, believ'd.On th' other, where an intersected spaceYet shows the semicircle void, abideAll they, who look'd to Christ already come.And as our Lady on her glorious stool,And they who on their stools beneath her sit,This way distinction make: e'en so on his,The mighty Baptist that way marks the line(He who endur'd the desert and the painsOf martyrdom, and for two years of hell,Yet still continued holy), and beneath,Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,Thus far from round to round.  So heav'n's decreeForecasts, this garden equally to fill.With faith in either view, past or to come,Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleavesMidway the twain compartments, none there areWho place obtain for merit of their own,But have through others' merit been advanc'd,On set conditions: spirits all releas'd,Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.And, if thou mark and listen to them well,Their childish looks and voice declare as much."Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;And gladly will I loose the knot, whereinThy subtle thoughts have bound thee.  From this realmExcluded, chalice no entrance here may find,No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can.A law immutable hath establish'd all;Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,Exactly, as the finger to the ring.It is not therefore without cause, that these,O'erspeedy comers to immortal life,Are different in their shares of excellence.Our Sovran Lord--that settleth this estateIn love and in delight so absolute,That wish can dare no further--every soul,Created in his joyous sight to dwell,With grace at pleasure variously endows.And for a proof th' effect may well suffice.And 't is moreover most expressly mark'dIn holy scripture, where the twins are saidTo, have struggled in the womb.  Therefore, as graceInweaves the coronet, so every browWeareth its proper hue of orient light.And merely in respect to his prime gift,Not in reward of meritorious deed,Hath each his several degree assign'd.In early times with their own innocenceMore was not wanting, than the parents' faith,To save them: those first ages past, behoov'dThat circumcision in the males should impThe flight of innocent wings: but since the dayOf grace hath come, without baptismal ritesIn Christ accomplish'd, innocence herselfMust linger yet below.  Now raise thy viewUnto the visage most resembling Christ:For, in her splendour only, shalt thou winThe pow'r to look on him."  Forthwith I sawSuch floods of gladness on her visage shower'd,From holy spirits, winging that profound;That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,Had not so much suspended me with wonder,Or shown me such similitude of God.And he, who had to her descended, once,On earth, now hail'd in heav'n; and on pois'd wing."Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena," sang:To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,From all parts answ'ring, rang: that holier joyBrooded the deep serene.  "Father rever'd:Who deign'st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!Say, who that angel is, that with such gleeBeholds our queen, and so enamour'd glowsOf her high beauty, that all fire he seems."So I again resorted to the loreOf my wise teacher, he, whom Mary's charmsEmbellish'd, as the sun the morning star;Who thus in answer spake: "In him are summ'd,Whatever of buxomness and free delightMay be in Spirit, or in angel, met:And so beseems: for that he bare the palmDown unto Mary, when the Son of GodVouchsaf'd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,And note thou of this just and pious realmThe chiefest nobles.  Those, highest in bliss,The twain, on each hand next our empress thron'd,Are as it were two roots unto this rose.He to the left, the parent, whose rash tasteProves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,That ancient father of the holy church,Into whose keeping Christ did give the keysOf this sweet flow'r: near whom behold the seer,That, ere he died, saw all the grievous timesOf the fair bride, who with the lance and nailsWas won.  And, near unto the other, restsThe leader, under whom on manna fedTh' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.On th' other part, facing to Peter, lo!Where Anna sits, so well content to lookOn her lov'd daughter, that with moveless eyeShe chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos'dTo the first father of your mortal kind,Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,When on the edge of ruin clos'd thine eye."But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)Here break we off, as the good workman doth,That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:And to the primal love our ken shall rise;That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, farAs sight can bear thee.  Yet, alas! in soothBeating thy pennons, thinking to advance,Thou backward fall'st.  Grace then must first be gain'd;Her grace, whose might can help thee.  Thou in prayerSeek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,Attend, and yield me all thy heart."  He said,And thus the saintly orison began.CANTO XXXIII"O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,Created beings all in lowlinessSurpassing, as in height, above them all,Term by th' eternal counsel pre-ordain'd,Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc'dIn thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,Himself, in his own work enclos'd to dwell!For in thy womb rekindling shone the loveReveal'd, whose genial influence makes nowThis flower to germin in eternal peace!Here thou to us, of charity and love,Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,To mortal men, of hope a living spring.So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,That he who grace desireth, and comes notTo thee for aidance, fain would have desireFly without wings.  Nor only him who asks,Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oftForerun the asking.  Whatsoe'er may beOf excellence in creature, pity mild,Relenting mercy, large munificence,Are all combin'd in thee.  Here kneeleth one,Who of all spirits hath review'd the state,From the world's lowest gap unto this height.Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring graceFor virtue, yet more high to lift his kenToward the bliss supreme.  And I, who ne'erCoveted sight, more fondly, for myself,Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst driveEach cloud of his mortality away;That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.This also I entreat of thee, O queen!Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thouWouldst after all he hath beheld, preserveAffection sound, and human passions quell.Lo!  Where, with Beatrice, many a saintStretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit!"The eyes, that heav'n with love and awe regards,Fix'd on the suitor, witness'd, how benignShe looks on pious pray'rs: then fasten'd theyOn th' everlasting light, wherein no eyeOf creature, as may well be thought, so farCan travel inward.  I, meanwhile, who drewNear to the limit, where all wishes end,The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),Ended within me. Beck'ning smil'd the sage,That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,Already of myself aloft I look'd;For visual strength, refining more and more,Bare me into the ray authenticalOf sovran light.  Thenceforward, what I saw,Was not for words to speak, nor memory's selfTo stand against such outrage on her skill.As one, who from a dream awaken'd, straight,All he hath seen forgets; yet still retainsImpression of the feeling in his dream;E'en such am I: for all the vision dies,As 't were, away; and yet the sense of sweet,That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart.Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal'd;Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lostThe Sybil's sentence.  O eternal beam!(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)Yield me again some little particleOf what thou then appearedst, give my tonguePower, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,Unto the race to come, that shall not loseThy triumph wholly, if thou waken aughtOf memory in me, and endure to hearThe record sound in this unequal strain.Such keenness from the living ray I met,That, if mine eyes had turn'd away, methinks,I had been lost; but, so embolden'd, onI pass'd, as I remember, till my viewHover'd the brink of dread infinitude.O grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav'stBoldness to fix so earnestly my kenOn th' everlasting splendour, that I look'd,While sight was unconsum'd, and, in that depth,Saw in one volume clasp'd of love, whateverThe universe unfolds; all propertiesOf substance and of accident, beheld,Compounded, yet one individual lightThe whole.  And of such bond methinks I sawThe universal form: for that wheneverI do but speak of it, my soul dilatesBeyond her proper self; and, till I speak,One moment seems a longer lethargy,Than five-and-twenty ages had appear'dTo that emprize, that first made Neptune wonderAt Argo's shadow darkening on his flood.With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,Wond'ring I gaz'd; and admiration stillWas kindled, as I gaz'd.  It may not be,That one, who looks upon that light, can turnTo other object, willingly, his view.For all the good, that will may covet, thereIs summ'd; and all, elsewhere defective found,Complete.  My tongue shall utter now, no moreE'en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe'sThat yet is moisten'd at his mother's breast.Not that the semblance of the living lightWas chang'd (that ever as at first remain'd)But that my vision quickening, in that soleAppearance, still new miracles descry'd,And toil'd me with the change.  In that abyssOf radiance, clear and lofty, seem'd methought,Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:And, from another, one reflected seem'd,As rainbow is from rainbow: and the thirdSeem'd fire, breath'd equally from both.  Oh speechHow feeble and how faint art thou, to giveConception birth!  Yet this to what I sawIs less than little.  Oh eternal light!Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyselfSole understood, past, present, or to come!Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in theeSeem'd as reflected splendour, while I mus'd;For I therein, methought, in its own hueBeheld our image painted: steadfastlyI therefore por'd upon the view.  As oneWho vers'd in geometric lore, would fainMeasure the circle; and, though pondering longAnd deeply, that beginning, which he needs,Finds not; e'en such was I, intent to scanThe novel wonder, and trace out the form,How to the circle fitted, and thereinHow plac'd: but the flight was not for my wing;Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,And in the spleen unfolded what it sought.Here vigour fail'd the tow'ring fantasy:But yet the will roll'd onward, like a wheelIn even motion, by the Love impell'd,That moves the sun in heav'n and all the stars.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Divine Comedy of Dante:  Paradiseby Dante Alighieri*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARADISE ******** This file should be named 1007.txt or 1007.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/0/1007/Produced by Judith Smith and Natalie SalterUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

BRAEME[Illustration]CHAPTER I.The Trial.Mr. Kent was a very able magistrate. He had sat on the bench for manyyears and was considered a man of great legal attainments and skill. Hevery seldom erred in his judgment, and being gifted with a naturalshrewdness, he saw the difference at once between a guilty and aninnocent man.He rarely erred; long practice had made him an adept in reading faces.But on this morning, the fourteenth of May, he was puzzled. Many caseshad been brought before him. Drunken men dismissed with a fine and areprimand, thieves sentenced to weeks or months of imprisonment, wiveswith pale faces and bruised arms had given reluctant evidence againsthusbands who had promised to love and cherish them until death.It was a bright May morning, and the sun did his best to pour throughthe dusky windows of the police court; a faint beam fell on the stolidfaces of the policemen and ushers of the court, the witnesses and thelookers-on; a faint beam that yet, perhaps, brought many messages ofbright promise to those present.A little boy had been sent on an errand with sixpence and had stolen themoney; with many sobs and tears he confessed that he had spent it incakes. Mr. Kent looked at the tear-stained face; the untidy brown headscarcely reached to the table, and the good magistrate thought, withsomething like pain at his heart, of a fair-haired boy at home. So hespoke kindly to the poor, trembling prisoner, and while he stronglyreprimanded, still encouraged him to better ways. The boy was removed,and then Mr. Kent was puzzled by the prisoner who took his place.A tall, handsome young man, apparently not more than twenty, with aclear-cut aristocratic face, and luminous dark gray eyes. A face that noone could look into without admiration--that irresistibly attracted man,woman and child. He was a gentleman--there could be no mistake about it.That clear-cut Norman face had descended to him from a long line ofancestors; the well-built, manly figure, with its peculiar easy graceand dignity told of ancient lineage and noble birth.His hands were white, slender and strong, with almond-shapednails--hands that had never been soiled with labor, and surely neverstained with crime.He carried his handsome head high; it was proudly set on a firm,graceful neck, and covered with clusters of dark hair. He would havelooked in his place near the throne of a queen, or, on the back of a warhorse, leading a forlorn hope; but no one could understand his beingprisoner in a dock. Mr. Kent looked at him, wondering with what he wascharged. Surely, with that noble face and gentlemanly bearing, he hadnever been guilty of a common assault. Magistrate as he was, Mr. Kentlistened to the recital of the charge, with some curiosity.Jules St. Croix, Count of the French Empire, charged the prisoner at thebar with having broken into his rooms for the purpose of robbery. He hadbeen discovered in the count's drawing-room, where he had forced open anivory casket and stolen the contents, which were an ancient and valuablegold watch and a gold ring, also of considerable value. At the momentthat the count, followed by his servant, entered the room, the prisonerhad these articles in his hand. He dropped them immediately, but thecount, hastily calling for the police, gave him in charge.There was a smell of burned paper in the room and it was nearly elevenat night.The magistrate asked if the prisoner had made any resistance. PolicemanC. No. 14, answered, "No, he gave in at once; and came straight away."Mr. Kent asked again: "Was there anything in the casket beside thejewelry?"It seemed to be a very insignificant question, but the prisoner and thecount looked steadfastly at each other and both answered: "No."There were two witnesses. Robert Bolton, the count's servant, and C. No.14, the policeman. The evidence of the servant was taken first. He saidthat the prisoner had called several times to see his master, alwayscoming when the count was from home; that he had, before, made one ortwo efforts to get into the count's room, but that he, the servant, hadalways refused him permission.On this evening the count went out early, and Robert Bolton having someerrands to do, followed his master. About ten o'clock the prisonercalled at the house, No. 24 Cambridge Terrace, and asked to speak toCount St. Croix. The landlady of the house told him the count was fromhome; then the prisoner said:"I know. I will go to his room and wait there for him."The landlady, believing him to be a perfect gentleman, allowed him togo up to the count's room. Robert Bolton returned home just as hismaster was at the door; when the landlady told him a gentleman waswaiting there, it flashed instantly into his mind there was somethingwrong. He hastily told his suspicions to the count and they ran upstairstogether. Opening the door quickly, they found the prisoner with thecasket in one hand and the watch in the other. There was an odor ofburnt paper in the room.The count immediately opened the window and called for the police. C.No. 14 was just passing, and in marvelously quick time he ran upstairs."This man has gotten into my room on false pretences," said the count."He is a stranger to me. I give him in charge for breaking open mycasket and stealing a watch and ring from it.""What did the prisoner say.""He pointed to the watch and ring, and said: 'There they are;' then helooked at the count with a smile.""Did he seem frightened?""Not the least in the world," was the answer; "just the contrary.""What happened next?""The prisoner told him he must consider himself a prisoner on the chargeof stealing a watch. He laughed aloud and walked away."The landlady of the house, the policeman and the count all gave the sameevidence. It seemed very clear against him."What have you to say?" asked, the magistrate of the prisoner.He raised his luminous gray eyes."Not one word," he replied, in a clear, refined voice."What is your name? I see you have refused to give any."For the first time the prisoner's face flushed crimson, and the countsmiled malignantly."My name is--John Smith," he replied, and again the count smiled."Your address?"He gave some number and street which every one knew to be false."Your occupation?" asked the magistrate again."I have none--that is, no settled occupation," he replied."Have you no lawyer to defend you?" asked Mr. Kent."I require none," said the prisoner; "I have no defense. All that CountJules St. Croix says is true; he found me in his room with the opencasket in my hand.""You had gone there for the purpose of robbery?""I have not a word to answer.""You can surely give some account of your presence there?"The prisoner smiled again."I refuse to do so," he replied, with great firmness, yet courtesy ofmanner."Then I must commit you for trial," said the magistrate. "Have you nowitnesses to bring forward in your own defense now, as to character--noreferees?" he continued."None," was the quiet reply."I am sorry," said Mr. Kent; "to see one who is so evidently agentleman and a man of education in such a position."But there was no shame in the handsome face; none in the proud eyes. Heraised his head with haughty grace and made no reply."I can take bail," said Mr. Kent, but the prisoner said, "I have none tooffer."Then was the good magistrate puzzled. He had no resource but to committhe young man to take his trial at the Sessions. Yet looking at theclear, aristocratic face, and the firm, proud lips, he could have swornthat the prisoner was perfectly innocent of the theft.He read pride, honesty, loyalty and chivalry in the face, yet there wasnothing left for him to do but to commit him.He looked very grave as he did so, and then John Smith was taken away bythe policeman. As he left the dock he turned to his accuser, the CountSt. Croix, who stood there with a dark frown on his face; he looked athim for one moment, then waved his hand, as one who had won a greatvictory."I have conquered," he said, and the count's sallow face grew pale withrage,"Curse you," he said, between his teeth, "I should like to stand with myfoot on your neck."CHAPTER II.The Sentence.John Smith--for the prisoner was known by no other name--lay in prisonuntil the time for his trial. He had not long to wait, but he made nocomplaint. He seemed perfectly at his ease--much more so than was Mr.Kent. In vain the good magistrate said to himself that it was nobusiness of his; that he had nothing whatever to do with the case, hehad simply performed his duty--done what was required of him. Yet hecould not feel satisfied; he was sure there was a mystery, and he longedto fathom it.He resolved to go and see the young man, and ask him more questions, totry to ascertain who he really was. He went to his cell and the prisonerlooked at him in utter surprise."I have come purposely," said Mr. Kent, "to see if I cannot induce youto tell the truth over this affair. I will call you John Smith, if youlike, yet I am sure you are a gentleman; you will not deny that?""I neither admit nor deny anything," was the smiling reply; "I have madeup my mind that there will be a certain punishment, and I shall gothrough it like a brave man.""Have you well considered what degradation that punishment will bringupon you as long as you live?"His face flushed hotly."Since you ask me," he answered, "I tell you frankly, no; I had notthought of that part of the business at all--it never even occurred tome; my thoughts were all otherwise engrossed.""You should take it into consideration," said the magistrate. "I knownothing of what your position in society may be, but remember, youvoluntarily cut yourself off from all association with even respectablepeople; a man who has been in prison cannot expect the countenance orfellowship of his fellow-men.""I suppose you are right," replied the young man; "although, believe me,never a thought of this occurred to me.""Now, would it not be better to tell the truth? Have you done it for awager? is it the trick of a foolish young man? or were you reallytempted to steal the watch?"Something like a smile curved his handsome lips."I cannot tell you," he replied. "I am deeply grateful for your kindinterest--indeed, I shall never forget it; but I cannot, in return, tellyou one word.""Then I can do nothing to help you?""No," he answered slowly; "you could not help sending me for trial. Willyou tell me what the probable result will be, supposing, as a matter ofcourse, that I am found guilty?""Most probably, six months imprisonment, without hard labor, if it be afirst offence.""It is the first of its kind," was the smiling reply."You will not let me help you, then, in any way?" said Mr. Kent."There is nothing you can do for me," said the young man, gratefully."If you take my advice," continued the magistrate, "you will send forsome clever lawyer; tell him the truth, whatever it may be, and whilepreserving your incognito, he may be able to do something for you. Ishould certainly do so in your place.""I think not," he replied; "the less stir made about it the better.Surely in the crowd of a criminal court and in the prison dress, I shallescape recognition?""An admission," thought the magistrate, "that he has concealed hisidentity.""I cannot tell; I think it doubtful.""Well, whatever comes, I shall always he grateful to you, Mr. Kent, foryour interest in me.""I am sorry you will not trust me," said the magistrate, rising to leavethe cell."I am still more sorry that I cannot," was the reply, and then theprisoner was left alone.He did not look much like a thief; there was a light on his face such asone sees in the pictures of the martyrs, a clear fire in the gray eyes."My ancestors have smiled with their heads on a block," he said."Surely, with such a motive, I may bear six months of prison."The day of his trial came. The report of it in the papers read asfollows:"John Smith, aged twenty, occupation unknown, was charged by Count JulesSt. Croix with stealing from his room an ivory casket, containing awatch and an antique ring of great value. The prisoner, who refused togive any account of himself, pleaded guilty; he made no defence, and hadretained no counsel. The judge made a few remarks to the effect that itwas very hard to see a young man, evidently possessed of some educationand refinement, in such a position, then sentenced him to six months'imprisonment without hard labor. Prisoner made no remark, and was thenremoved."The papers did not tell of a little incident that occurred, simplybecause the reporters did not know it. During the hearing of the case,which did not last long, one of the leading barristers, Mr. Macfarlane,sat with his eyes riveted on the prisoner's face, his own growing verypale and anxious; then he wrote a little note, which he dispatched by amessenger, who soon returned, accompanied by Mr. Forster, one of themost celebrated lawyers in Lincoln's Inn.He spoke a few words to Mr. Macfarlane."Nonsense!" he said; "the idea is incredible, impossible, even. What canhave made you think of such a thing?""Stand here in my place; you cannot see over all those heads. Now lookwell at him. Am I right or wrong?"A strange gray look came over Mr. Forster's face."I--I believe you are right," he said. "My God! what can this mean?""Look now! his face is turned this way! Look!" cried Mr. Macfarlane,eagerly."It is he!" cried the lawyer, and he stood like one turned to stone,then recovering himself, he said quickly:"Why is he here? What is he charged with?"Mr. Macfarlane whispered into the lawyer's ear:"With stealing a watch and ring from the room of Count Jules St. Croix.""Absurd!" was the reply, in accents of the deepest contempt; "whatidiotic nonsense! He steal a watch! I could believe myself mad ordreaming.""Then," said Mr. Macfarlane. "he has pleaded guilty; he has made nodefence, engaged no counsel.""The boy is mad! completely mad!" cried the lawyer."Hush!" said the barrister; "the judge is speaking."Mr. Forster stood in a most impatient mood, while the grave, clear voiceof the judge sentenced the prisoner. Then he turned to the barristerabruptly."I tell you," he cried, "the boy is mad! Steal a watch! Why, he couldbuy one-half the watches in London if he liked. I must see him. Comethis way.""No," said Mr. Macfarlane, "he evidently does not wish to be known. Ishall not go near him.""If he got into trouble, why in the world did he not send for me or forsome one else?" said the lawyer to himself. "It must be a young man'sfrolic, a wager, a bet. He has spirit enough for anything. He nevercould have been such a mad fool as to wreck his life for a paltrywatch."Mr. Forster went to the room, where with other prisoners, John Smithstood, awaiting his removal in the prison van. He went up to him andtouched him on the shoulder."Is it really you?" he cried, and the luminous gray eyes smiled intohis."Ah! Forster, I am sorry to see you. What has brought you here?""It is you," said the lawyer. "I was in hopes that my senses deceivedme.""I hope you will keep the fact of having seen me here a profoundsecret.""But in the name of heaven, what does it mean?" cried Mr. Forster. "Youknow you have not attempted to steal a watch. Pardon me, but how dareyou plead guilty? You will cover yourself with disgrace and infamy. Youwill break your mother's heart. You will be utterly ruined for life.""My dear Forster, no one knows of my being here, and no one need knowexcept yourself.""You are mistaken; you have been recognized. I was sent for to identifyyou."Then the proud face did grow pale, but the proud light did not die outof the gray eyes."I am sorry for it, but I cannot help it. I must 'dree my weird.'"Mr. Forster stood looking at him like one stupefied."If the sun had fallen from the heavens," he said, "it would not havesurprised me more. Surely, surely you are going to trust me and tell mewhat this means?""I cannot. Go on with everything just the same. Tell my mother I havegone abroad for six months, and if you value my name, keep my secretfrom spreading, if you can."And then a rough voice called John Smith to the prison van.CHAPTER III.The Papers Again.Mr. Foster went home in a terrible rage. His clerks could not imaginewhat had happened. He looked pale, worried, anxious and miserable. "Ishould not think," he said to himself, "that such a thing ever happenedin the world before." His clients thought him bad tempered; he had theair of a man with whom everything had gone wrong--out of sorts with allthe world."The man is mad," he said to himself, with a shrug of his shoulders;"neither more nor less than mad to fling away his life and disgrace hisname. It is useless to think it will never be known; those stupid papersare sure to get hold of it, and then there is little chance of secrecy."He went about his work with a very unsettled, wretched expression on hisshrewd face. Something or other had evidently disturbed him very much.While on his part John Smith, with the same light in his face and thesame fire in his eyes, went off in the prison van.He heard very little of what was going on around him. He seemed to bequite apart in some dreamland, some world of his own. When the coarsesuit of prison clothes was brought to him, instead of the disgust theattendants expected to see, there came over his face a smile. To himselfhe said: "I could almost kiss them for her sweet sake.""That man is no thief," said one of the warders. "I do not care if theydid catch him with the watch in his hand, he is no thief! I know thestamp!"How he passed that first day and night was best known to himself. Thejailer who brought his breakfast the next morning said, "You looktired."He smiled and said to himself, "I would have gone to death for her sweetsake! This will be easy to bear."When that same morning dawned Mr. Forster was all impatience for hisnewspaper. Twice he rang the bell and asked if it had come, and when theservant brought it up he looked at it eagerly."Give it to me quickly," he said. Then he opened it, and was soonengrossed in the contents. Suddenly he flung it down, and almost stampedupon it in his rage."I knew it would be so! Now it will be blazoned all over England! Whatcan have possessed him?"The paragraph that excited his attention and anger ran as follows:"We are informed on good authority that the John Smith tried yesterdayon the charge of stealing a watch is no less a person than BasilCarruthers, Esquire, the owner of Ulverston Priory, and head of one ofthe oldest families in England.""What can I do?" cried Mr. Forster; "it will break his mother's heart;she can never forget it. He is ruined for life. For a lawyer, I amstrangely unwilling to tell a lie; but it must be done! He must be savedat any price!" He went to his desk and wrote the following note:     "To the Editor of 'The Times':     "Sir: I beg to call your attention to a paragraph that appears in     'The Times' of today stating that a man, tried under the name of     John Smith for stealing a watch, is no less a person than Basil     Carruthers, Esq., of Ulverston Priory. As the solicitor of that     family, and manager of the Ulverston property, I beg to contradict     it. Mr. Carruthers, himself, informed me of his intention to go     abroad. Without doubt his indignant denial will follow mine. I am,     sir, etc.,     "Herbert Forster.""That may help him," he said. "I do not like doing it, but I cannot seemy old friend's son perish without trying to save him. I may fail, but Imust try. Perhaps my lie may be blotted out, like Uncle Toby's oath. IfI can persuade him to send a denial, and date it Paris or Vienna, hewill be saved."Mr. Forster lost no time in applying for an order to see the prisoner.It was granted at once.Basil Carruthers--we may use his right name now--looked up in surprisewhen Mr. Forster, with the paper in his hand, entered the cell."Back again?" he said."Yes; it is just as I expected; the papers have got hold of your name,and there is a grand expose."Basil held out his hand and read the paragraph."It is enough to make your father rise up from his grave," said thelawyer; "I cannot understand what madness, what infatuation, has comeover you, to drag such a proud name as yours through the dust.""So it is known," said Basil, slowly. "Well, I cannot help it.""I have done my best," said Mr. Forster. "I have never yet asked you ifyou stole the watch--the idea is too absurd.""They are so far right that I was found in the room; nothing elsematters.""I can only imagine that the same folly which has brought you here willkeep you here," said Mr. Forster. "The only thing to be done is to senda denial to the papers. If you will write one, I will go to Paris myselfto post it."Basil Carruthers laughed contemptuously."I shield myself behind a lie!" he said. "Never!""You are too late," replied Mr. Forster; "I have already written, andsent, a very indignant denial, saying you have gone abroad."Basil's face grew pale, as it had not done during that trial; then anangry fire flashed from his eyes."And you have dared to do this?" he cried. "You have dared to publish alie to screen a Carruthers?""I would have dared a great deal more to have saved you from publicignominy," said Mr. Forster."Do not apply that word to me!" said Basil, angrily."If I do not, every one else will. Your position is ignominious, Mr.Carruthers; the paltry crime you are charged with is the same; and thename that for centuries has been honored in England will be low in thedust, sir. I would rather have been dead than have seen such a day."The handsome young face changed slightly; evidently these thoughts hadnot occurred to him; he seemed to seek solace from some inward source ofcomfort of which the lawyer knew nothing."I must bear it," he said, unflinchingly."There is but one thing you can do," said Mr. Forster; "only one meansof escape--write a letter at once containing a most indignant denial ofthe identity. I will go myself purposely to Paris and post it there.""My dear Forster," said the young man with a smile of languid contempt,"I would not ransom my life, even, with a lie!""In my opinion," said the lawyer, bluntly, "you have done worse inpleading guilty--you have acted a lie, at least.""I know my own motive. I am the best judge of my own actions.""Certainly," was the sarcastic reply. "I should not think any young manof your prospects was ever in such a position before.""Perhaps, as I said before, no man ever had the same motive," and a lookof heroism and high resolve came over his face which astonished thelawyer."In the name of your dead father," he said, "who held the honor of hishouse so dear, I pray of you to write that letter!""Not to save my head from the block!" he replied. "I am here, and I mustbear all that follows. I had hoped to preserve my incognito. If Icannot, well, I must bear the shame.""And your mother?" asked the lawyer."My poor mother! Perhaps, after all, you had better go down to Ulverstonand tell her! She will begin to wonder where I am. Besides, the Londonhouse must be attended to.""If I know Lady Carruthers rightly," said the lawyer, "she will neverget over the blow.""Tell her that I am here, and why, but tell her also that I refuse togive an explanation to any human being. Tell her the honor of theCarruthers seals my lips; try to comfort her if she seems distressed; doall she wishes you.""How am I to comfort a mother whose eldest and only son has thrown allprudence to the wind; who has disgraced himself so far as to stand in afelon's dock; who has wantonly laid his life bare and waste--for what?"A strange smile came over the young face."Ah! for what! I know; no one else does. There is a reward, and itsatisfies me.""If ever a Carruthers went mad," said Mr. Forster, angrily, "I shouldsay you were mad now!"Basil paid no heed to the remark."The only thing I can do," he said, "I will do. I will go to Vienna assoon as I leave here. I will not remain in London one-half hour.""I fear your compliance will be too late then," he said. "I must leaveyou, if I go to Ulverston this evening. I have several matters that Imust attend to. Will any persuasion of mine induce you to alter yourmind?""No; though I thank you for your interest."And the lawyer left the young man's cell with something like a moan uponhis lips.CHAPTER IV.Ulverston Priory.During his walk from the prison to his office, Mr. Forster was stoppedseveral times."Is this rumor about young Carruthers true?" asked Sir James Hamlyn,anxiously."No," replied the little lawyer, stoutly, "the paragraph is a joke, andif we can find out the author of it, he will be punished.""Serve him right. I told Lady Hamlyn there was some absurd mistake. Veryglad to hear it. Good morning.""Mr. Forster, stop one moment!" cried Major Every; "surely this tale ofCarruthers stealing a watch is all false?""False as the foul fiend himself," said the little man, in a rage."I knew it--I said so. Young men with twenty thousand a year do notsteal. A likely story! What does it mean, then?""Some one who owes him an ill-turn has played this sorry jest upon him;but we shall pay him.""He deserves transportation. I do not know a nobler young fellow in allthe world than Basil Carruthers." A fashionable carriage was standing athis office door when he reached it."The Countess of Northdown waiting to see you, sir," said the clerk.Entering his private room he saw a lovely lady, fashionably attired, whogreeted him with exquisite grace. Her face was very pale and her lipsquivered as she spoke to him."Good morning, Mr. Forster. You will be surprised to see me, but knowingyou are the family solicitor, I called to ask you if this shocking storyabout Mr. Carruthers is true.""Heaven have mercy on me this day," thought the lawyer, "my soul issteeped in lies.""Certainly not, Lady Northdown. Mr. Carruthers is abroad. The fact ofthe matter is, the prisoner resembles him, as a vile caricature does, attimes, resemble the original, and some would-be wag who saw it, thoughtthe writing of this absurd paragraph a great joke.""He deserves shooting," said my lady, angrily."That may be his fate, when Mr. Carruthers catches him," was the grimreply."I told Lord Northdown it was all nonsense," she continued. "I am muchobliged to you for your kindness, Mr. Forster."There was a rustle of silken robes, a stirring of sweet perfume, andthen Lady Northdown was gone, only to be succeeded by another andanother, until the lawyer gave himself up for lost on account of themany falsehoods he had told."Tomorrow my contradiction will set all this straight," he thought;"especially if it be followed by a letter from my lady, and I mustcompel her to write. I would as soon try to drive wild oxen as topersuade a Carruthers."He was not able to start for Ulverston until the end of the afternoon.It was full two hours' ride by rail from London, and all the way therethe lawyer was worrying himself with conjectures, and trying to solvewhat he thought honestly the greatest mystery he had ever known.It was six o'clock on a bright May evening when he reached Ulverston.He ordered a fly, and drove at once to the Priory. More than half thatbusy town of Rutsford belonged to the Carruthers. They were lords of themanor, masters of the soil. To them belonged also the fertile lands, theprofitable farms, the hop gardens, and broad meadows that stretchedbetween Rutsford and the Priory.As the lawyer drove through this rich inheritance, his wonder increased.What could possess any man blessed with such a birthright to placehimself in so false and degraded a position?Then the carriage entered the Ulverston woods, said by connoisseurs tobe the finest and most picturesque in England. Such a glorious sight onthis May evening as made the lawyer's heart beat, though many years hadpassed since the fountain of poetry flowed for him. The hawthorn andchestnut trees were all in flower; the maple and ash wore their mostluxuriant foliage. The grand old oaks in their leafy boughs concealedmyriads of singing birds; underneath the shade of the trees, the bluehyacinths stretched out like the waves of the azure sea, the violets hidtheir modest heads, great golden primroses shone like stars from themidst of green leaves. The air was sweet and warm; the music of thebirds and the whispers of the wind were full of melody."A man possessed of all this," thought Mr. Forster again; "he must bemad."Then the carriage stopped before the grand entrance of one of the mostmagnificent mansions in England. Ulverston Priory--whose beauty has beendescribed, in prose and in verse, by pens more eloquent than mine."Is Lady Carruthers at home?" asked Mr. Forster of the stately oldbutler."My lady is at home, sir.""Will you ask if it is convenient for me to see her? I have come hastilyfrom London on important business."With all the solemnity an old family retainer displays on suchoccasions, the butler led the way to the library."I will send your message to my lady at once, sir."He went away and soon returned."My lady is dressing, but she will be with you in a few minutes." Heplaced a decanter of the famous Ulverston sherry on the table, andwithdrew. Mr. Forster gladly helped himself to a glass. "I would takethat or anything else to give me courage," he said to himself. "How am Ito tell her? I know not."In a quarter of an hour the door opened, and a stately lady,magnificently dressed, entered the room. She was very dignified, ofqueenly presence and bearing, with the remains of great beauty in herface.She bowed most courteously to the lawyer, and held out her white,jeweled hand."Good evening, Mr. Forster," she said; "your visit has taken me bysurprise. You are well. I hope?""Quite well, Lady Carruthers, myself. Quite well, I thank you."But his manner was so confused, his face so flushed, that the statelylady looked at him in wonder."And my son, Mr. Forster! Have you seen him lately? Have you left himwell?""He was in perfect health, Lady Carruthers, when I saw him last,"replied the lawyer, stiffly."I am glad of it. I have no wish to complain, but I have not heard frommy son lately. He has not time to write, I suppose.""There will be no use in beating about the bush," the lawyer thought. "Ihad better speak plainly at once.""Lady Carruthers," he said, "have you seen today's 'Times'?""No," she replied; "I have been so deeply engaged with visitors, I havereally not opened it.""Then I must ask you to prepare yourself for something verydisagreeable. I wish I knew how to save you from the knowledge--but I donot."The diamond necklace rose and fell as though she breathed heavily; herface grew quite white."Does it concern my son, Mr. Carruthers?" she asked."Alas, that I must say yes, Lady Carruthers," he answered; "I am not aman of sentiment, but I would give many years of my life to spare youthis pain.""Is he dead?" she asked, hoarsely."No, it is not so bad as that," he replied."Not death; and I know it is not disgrace. I can bear what you have totell me, Mr. Forster."He took both papers from his pocket and laid them before her."Read this paragraph first," he said; "and then this."She did as he wished. When she read the second, her proud face flushed,and she drew her figure to its full height."What does this mean?" she said, contemptuously. "My son, Mr.Carruthers, charged with stealing a watch? What does it mean, Mr.Forster?""Lady Carruthers," said the lawyer, "it is true. I was in court whenyour son, under the name of John Smith, pleaded guilty to the charge ofgetting in the room belonging to Count Jules St. Croix, and I, myself,heard him sentenced to six months' imprisonment."She sat for some minutes, silent, mute and motionless. Then in a lowvoice she asked: "Is he mad?""That was my first thought. It is some weeks since I had seen him, andyesterday morning a note was brought to my office, from a gentleman incourt, telling me your son was in the dock. I hastened there and foundit true. You may imagine how quickly I followed him and implored of himto tell me the mystery, for mystery I feel sure there is. Instead oflooking ashamed of himself and miserable, he had a light in his facethat puzzled me. I blamed him, told him the consequences--how his lifewould be useless to him after this, but he only smiled; my words made noimpression on him; he evidently derived comfort and support from somesource known to himself and no others.""And is it possible?" asked Lady Carruthers, with ghastly face; "does helie in prison now?""He does indeed, and there he must remain until the six months areended."CHAPTER V.Lady Carruthers.My lady rose from her seat with an air of almost tragical dignity."My son in prison!" she cried; "I cannot believe it. What has come overhim? Can you explain the mystery to me, Mr. Forster?""I cannot--the only thing that occurs to me is that he has gone to thiscount's room for some purpose that he will confide to no one, and thathe has taken the watch in his hands and was discovered with it. He askedme to tell you that the honor of the Carruthers sealed his lips.""Did he say that--my Basil, Mr. Forster? If that be the case, restassured--although I blush to say it--there is a woman in it. I canimagine Basil capable of suffering anything from a mistaken motive ofchivalry. Do you know with whom Mr. Carruthers has chiefly associatedsince he has been in town?""I do not. I know that he has been in a very fast and fashionable set;he told me as much; also that he has spent a good deal of money. Onecheck for three thousand pounds vanished in a day, and he gave noaccount of it.""Three thousand pounds!" cried Lady Carruthers; "yet he neither drank,betted nor gambled.""No," said the lawyer; "Mr. Carruthers told me he had never touched acard and never would. I know he did not care for betting."The proud, anxious mother raised her eyes to the lawyer's face. "How,then, do you think he has got through it?""I cannot tell. You must pardon me, my lady, if I remind you thatalthough I am family solicitor, agent and manager of the property, I amnot the guardian of your son.""I know," she said, clasping her hands. "I little thought he would everneed a guardian; he seemed all that was honorable and upright. I cannotimagine what has changed him. I regret so bitterly that I let him go toLondon alone.""It is a terrible position," said the lawyer; "the only thing is toclear him as much as we can. The moment I read this I wrote an answerand sent it to the 'Times' to the effect that Mr. Carruthers had goneabroad."A slight frown came over the delicate face."I implored Mr. Carruthers to write an indignant denial, and to let mego to Paris to post it, but he would not hear of such a thing; the veryidea seemed offensive to him. I hope, Lady Carruthers, to induce you towrite such a letter.""What kind of a letter?" she asked."One to the editor of the 'Times' denying the report, and saying thatyour son has gone abroad.""But that would be grossly untrue," she said."Yes, yes! I know that, still if we can save him, we should.""I will try any honorable means you choose to suggest," she replied;"but not even to save my son from death could I consent to write orpublish a lie.""Of course you know best, Lady Carruthers," said the lawyer, with ashrug of the shoulders. "Words are but words, and very few of them mighthave saved your son from public shame.""I have never yet believed in the success of a lie," said her ladyship."Pardon me," said Mr. Forster, grimly, "then you have forgotten thepages of history. I came down purposely to persuade your ladyship to dothis. I am well aware that at first sight it seems contrary to all one'snotions of truth and honor, but there is so much at stake. My denial,couched in strong terms, will appear tomorrow. If it were succeeded by aletter from your ladyship, written in the same strain, people wouldlaugh and believe that it was a great mistake. I had so many inquiriesthis morning before I left London, and I gave the same answer to all,that it was the sorry jest of an evil-disposed person. If your ladyshipwould but second my efforts, all would be well; we could get him throughin safety."But Lady Carruthers had risen from her seat and stood with her proudfigure drawn to its utmost height."I will do anything you propose, save tell a lie. If my son can berescued by no other means, he must bear his punishment.""Then my journey is in vain," said Mr. Forster. "I may return to Londonat once.""No," said Lady Carruthers; "I cannot allow you to return after thatlong journey--you must stay and dine with us. Pardon me," she said,seeing that he looked hurt and uncomfortable. "I have spoken strongly,but truth has always been far dearer to me than life. I do full justiceto your motives. I appreciate your kindness, but in this manner I cannothelp you. Stay and take dinner with us; then we can consult as to whatis best to be done.""May I give your ladyship one piece of advice?" said the lawyer. "Havethe papers--yesterday's and today's--destroyed, so that no rumor ofanything amiss can reach your servants; also say nothing of it--it maypossibly die away, as some rumors do. Your visitors and friends will notbroach such a subject to you, I am sure.""I shall not mention it," she replied; "although Marion will be sure tosuspect something wrong." At that moment the last dressing-bell rang."You will join us in a few minutes," said Lady Carruthers; "never mindyour traveling-dress; Miss Hautville and I are quite alone."No one who saw Lady Carruthers leave the library with stately step anddignified air, would have believed that she had received a blow whichlaid her life and all her hopes in ruins--as the lightning smites thelofty oak. She went back to her sumptuous bedroom that she had left halfan hour ago, so calm and serene, so unconscious of coming evil. Lookingin the mirror, she saw her face was deadly pale--there was no trace ofcolor left on it, and deep lines had come on her brow that had been socalm."It will not do to look so pale," said Lady Carruthers; and from one ofthe mysterious little drawers she took a small powder puff that soonremedied the evil.Then she went to the dining-room. Miss Hautville and Mr. Forster weretalking together like old acquaintances, and the three sat down todinner together.Mr. Forster was, as he himself often said, a grim old lawyer, withoutany poetry or romance, but even he could not sit opposite the pale, pureloveliness of Marion Hautville unmoved; there was something about herthat reminded one irresistibly of starlight, delicate, graceful, holyveiled loveliness. She was slender and graceful, with a figure that wascharming now, but that promised, in years to come, to be superb; thesame promise of magnificent womanhood was in the lovely delicate face.The pure profile, the delicate brows, the shining hair, braided Madonnafashion, were all beautiful, but looking at her, one realized there wasgreater beauty to come.She looked across the table with a smile."And now, Mr. Forster, you have told me how London looks; tell mesomething about my cousin, Mr. Carruthers."He made some indifferent answer, and as he did so, he thought tohimself:"Can it be possible, that with a chance of winning this lovely girl--oneof the richest heiresses in London--that Basil Carruthers has given hisheart to some worthless creature, who has spent his money and helped himto prison?"A question that, if our readers will kindly follow us, we will answer inthe succeeding chapters.CHAPTER VI.Youth Full of Beauty and Promise.There was no man of greater note in England than the late RoystonCarruthers, Esq., Lord of the Manor of Rutsford. He was one of theablest statesmen and finest orators in England. He had been returned forthe Borough of Rutsford for many years, without opposition. To hear himmake a speech was a decided treat; a handsome man of stately presence,he invested every word with new dignity. The grand volume of soundrolled on in one continuous stream; the ideas he expressed were noble,the sentiments patriotic and exalted; his gestures were full ofanimation and grace.Royston Carruthers had done great service to his country in his time. Hehad advocated several important measures; his eloquence had facilitatedthe introduction of several bills; his country thought well of him, andfor a wonder, was grateful to him.Government offered him the title of Baron Rutsford of Rutsford, and hehad declined it, saying that his ancestors had for years asked no highertitle than that of Lord of the Manor, and he valued his name--Carruthersof Ulverston--too highly to ever exchange it for another.In the very pride and zenith of his prosperity he married the LadyHildegarde Blenholme, the only daughter of the Duke of Blenholme. Shewas a very beautiful and accomplished woman--proud to a fault, butgenerous and noble in disposition. They had one child, Basil, and whilehe was yet a boy, his father died, worn out with work and over-exertion.He left his wife, Lady Hildegarde Carruthers, sole guardian of the boy,expressing a wish that she should bring him up to resemble herself inmind and disposition as far as it was possible.Three years after the great statesman's death, a cousin of LadyHildegarde died, leaving her only child, Marion Hautville, under thesole care and guardianship of the mistress of Ulverston Priory."Bring her up as you would a daughter of your own," wrote the dyingmother. "She has a large fortune--save her from fortune-hunters."And Lady Carruthers scrupulously carried out her kinswoman's wish. Shetook the girl to her own home, Ulverston Priory; she superintended hereducation; she brought her up in simple, refined habits--succeeded inmaking of her a perfect lady and a noble woman.Then the dearest wish of her heart was to see her son, the heir toUlverston, marry Marion Hautville, one of the loveliest girls andwealthiest heiresses in England. She was far too wise ever to expresssuch a wish openly, none the less it was deeply engraven on her heart.They were warmly attached to each other and Lady Carruthers fancied thatshe already saw some signs of liking on the part of Marion for Basil.While Miss Hautville pursued her quiet, ordinary course of educationunder Lady Carruthers' roof, Basil went through Eton and Oxford; at bothplaces he gained high honors and at both places he succeeded in puzzlinghis tutors and masters. He was of such a peculiar disposition;chivalrous, romantic, brave, yet with something about him--they couldnot define what, but quite unlike other boys.He did not evince any taste for any particular branch of study; he hadno inclination for the navy, for serving his country as his father haddone before him. In fact, it was difficult to tell in what direction histaste really lay. Still, he left college with high honors, and hismasters prophesied great things for him."He will make himself famous some day," they wrote to his anxiousmother. "In the mean time, let him see something of the world, and youwill know in what direction his talent lies."So, crowded with honors, he came home to Ulverston. He was eighteen thenand one of the handsomest young men England could boast. No barber'sbeauty; strong, comely, of noble bearing, with a face that had come tohim from the crusaders of old.Then Lady Hildegarde set herself to work to discover what manner of manher son was. She was puzzled; he was brave, generous, full of highspirits, truthful, even to bluntness. She could not discover any gravefault in him. She thanked God he had no vices, no mean faults, nocontemptible failings."Basil," she said to him, one evening, as the three sat around thedrawing-room fire. "Confess now, do you not like and admire the oldentimes better than these?""Yes," he replied; "I always did.""I knew it," said Lady Hildegarde; "I understand now what has alwayspuzzled everyone who has had the care of you. You were born two hundredyears too late; the ancient days of knight errantry and chivalry wouldhave suited you better than these.""It is your fault, mother," he replied. "When I was only twelve yearsold, you gave me a beautiful edition of Froissart's Chronicles, andeverything else has seemed dull and tame to me since.""I thought as much," she said, quietly; "you make the same mistakeothers have made before you; you live in the past, not in the present.""You are right, mother; in these days, there seems to me nothing to do.""Your father thought differently," she said; "he died from overwork.""Ah! my dear father was a genius," said the young man, thoughtfully, andfor some minutes there was silence between them."I can understand you," said Lady Hildegarde, with a smile; "you wouldlike to have been a knight, always looking out for some romanticadventure; you would have fought giants, released distressedprincesses.""Overthrown all wrong and upheld all right," he said; "that would havebeen my vocation."Lady Hildegarde went over to him and laid her hand on his head. "Mydearest boy, you are young yet, but will live to see that there is asmuch to be done in the way of redressing wrong now as there was in thedays when knights rode forth to do battle for lady fair.""I want some romantic adventure," he said; "I cannot see much in theplain, common ways of man. I should like to do something that would makeme a hero at once, something brave and glorious.""My dear boy," she said; "God grant you may learn to distinguish truefrom false, true romance from mere sentiment, true gold from mereglitter."He looked so eager, so handsome, she kissed him with passionate love."I should like to have been one of King Arthur's knights," he said,musingly."My dear Basil," said his mother; "your mind is chaos. I tell you thereare giants to be fought, hydra-headed ones--the giants of ignorance, ofwickedness, of injustice, and they call for a sharper, keener sword thanthat wielded by the knights of old."And there came into her heart a great fear lest her boy, who had toomuch imagination, too much ideality, would waste his life in dreams."I will tell you, Basil," said Marion Hautville; "what I call a greathero. The man who does his duty perfectly in the state of life in whichGod has placed him.""We all do that," replied Basil."Indeed we do not--you do not, to begin with. You ought now, instead ofdreaming about Froissart and his barbaric times, you ought to bestudying hard how to make a good master of this large estate--how toemploy the vast wealth given to you--how best to serve your God, yourcountry and those who will depend upon you.""Solomon in petticoats!" cried Basil, gaily, and Marion joined in hislaugh.That conversation gave Lady Carruthers many uneasy moments. Sheunderstood so well the dreamy, yet ardent, romantic temperament of theboy."What shall I make of him?" she said. "Will he ever learn to livecontentedly here at Ulverston, doing his duty, as Marion says, to Godand man? My poor Basil, he lives too late!"She asked advice from those best fitted to give it. One and all said thesame thing; there would be nothing so useful for him as a tour on theContinent, seeing plenty of the world and going into society.So Lady Carruthers, who loved home very dearly, gave up its peacefultranquillity, and went with Basil and Miss Hautville to Paris, wherethey remained some months until they saw all that was most brilliant inthat brilliant capital; from there to Berlin; then on to Vienna, andBasil lost much of his dreamy nature.He was eager, ardent, impetuous, longing, as is the fashion of youngmen, to do brave deeds, to be a great hero, and not in the least knowingwhat to do.He was just twenty when they returned home, at the commencement of theyear; Lady Carruthers, worn out with travel and excitement, longing forrest. There was more to be done--her son had been presented at most ofthe courts of Europe; he must attend the first levees held in Londonthis season.The Carruthers had a magnificent mansion in Belgravia. Miss Hautvillebegged for one year more of seclusion and privacy, so that LadyHildegarde and her son went to London alone. She remained there for aweek, and then, finding her son afloat in London society, she returnedto Ulverston.And Basil Carruthers, the dreamy, ardent, romantic boy, remained inLondon alone.CHAPTER VII.A Modern Bayard.Perhaps Lady Carruthers never did a more unwise thing than when she lefther son, with his peculiar temperament and notions, to go through aLondon season alone. She honestly believed herself to be doing right.She was ill and unable to bear the whirl of fashion and gaiety. Shecould not withdraw him from town to spend the gayest month of the yearin seclusion."Leave him to me, Hildegarde," said her cousin, Colonel Mostyn. "I willpilot him safely through the rocks and deep waters; nothing makes a manas self-reliant as feeling that he is trusted entirely."And knowing that Colonel Mostyn was an elderly man, who knew about asmuch as there was to know of life in all its phases, Lady Hildegarde hadno scruples.The colonel and the young squire were most luxuriously established atRoche House, the Carruthers' family mansion in Belgravia. LadyHildegarde made every arrangement for keeping up the establishment inall bachelor's comforts. There was an excellent housekeeper, one who hadbeen at Ulverston Priory for many years."You will be able to give some good dinner-parties," she said to herson; "bachelor dinners--bien entender--for Mrs. Richards is an excellenthousekeeper."Assured and satisfied that all would go well, she left London. Shehesitated as to whether she should give her son any warning about loveor marriage, then decided that it would be quite useless."The boy is naturally so fastidious and refined," she thought; "he willnever love beneath him. He will see no one so nice as Marion."So Lady Hildegarde Carruthers went to her stately home, little dreamingof the fatal news that was to follow her.Basil cared little for the fashions and frivolities of the day; ColonelMostyn tried to laugh him out of his romantic and chivalrous ideas."You are behind the age, Basil--quite unfit for it," he would say tohim. "Chevalier Bayard would not be appreciated in these times."He listened with a smile on his face, while the young man talked ofsomething to do--some grand action to fill up his life, some heroic deedwith which to crown himself."Utopian, Basil--all those are Utopian ideas. Progress is the order ofthe day.""Is there nothing?" asked Basil, "no way in which a man may distinguishhimself after the fashion of the heroes of old?"The colonel smiled sarcastically."My dear boy," he said, "between ourselves, some of those heroes ofyours were unmitigated ruffians, I hardly like to give utterance to sucha sentiment, yet I believe it. You cannot defend a bridge after thefashion of Horatius--you cannot conquer worlds like Alexander. I fancyyou will have to be content with being one of the best lords of themanor Rutsford has ever known.""You are sentimental, Basil," he said to him one morning, "but notpractical. A man is nothing unless he is practical. Why not give up allthese foolish notions of being a great hero? Go down to Ulverston,build schools, almhouses, mechanics' institutes and all that kind ofthing. Marry and bring up your family to fear God and serve the queen.One ounce of such practice is worth all the theory in the world."But Basil could not see it--he longed for the unattainable, the ideal.What lay plainly before him was a matter of great indifference to him.Colonel Mostyn, the keen, cynical man of the world, was, perhaps, thebest companion he could have had. But the colonel had many anxiousthoughts over him. At last an idea struck him."The finest thing that could happen to Basil would be a very decidedflirtation with a beautiful, worldly woman, who would laugh him out ofthese fantastic ideas and make a modern man of him."So thought the colonel, and so has thought many a one before him, littledreaming of the danger of playing with fire.But Basil did not seem to care much for ladies' society. He went to twoor three grand balls and pronounced them stupid, on hearing which, thecolonel raised his eyes and hands in horror."A young man of twenty who finds a ball stupid is past hope," he said.There had been a great flutter in the dovecotes when it was known thatBasil Carruthers, the heir of Ulverston, son of the great statesman, ayoung man whose income was quite twenty thousand per annum, besides thesavings of a long minority, was in London--free, disengaged, and, as amatter of course, wanting a wife. Invitations literally poured in uponhim--he accepted them at first, but soon grew tired."A tres dansantes at Lady Cecilia Gorton's," he said, holding out aninvitation card at arm's length. "Go, if you like, colonel. I do notcare for it."The colonel was engrossed in the buttering of his roll, an operationwhich he always performed himself, but he was sufficiently astonished topause in his proceedings and look at his nephew with a very horrifiedface."You do not mean to tell me, Basil, that you are tired of ladies--youngladies?""My dear colonel," said the young man, quietly, "I am very sorry to tellyou that I find one chignon very much the same as another."Colonel Mostyn sighed deeply. What Mentor could make anything out ofsuch a Telemachus? He resigned himself, thankful that what he called onecivilized taste remained--Basil enjoyed the opera."I would really sooner see him fall in love with an opera dancer thanremain what he is," thought the man of the world.One evening they went to the opera. It was "Lucretia Borgia," and, asusual, Basil Carruthers saw nothing but the stage. In vain did theunwearied colonel call his attention to Lady Evelyn Hope, the lovelyblonde; the fascinating Spanish Countess Rosella; to the twin sisters,the Ladies Isabel and Marie Duncan--he looked at them without interest."I wonder," thought the colonel to himself, "if the woman be living whocould touch that cold, icy heart!"The opera was nearly over when he saw Basil looking intently at theoccupants of a box on the grand tier. He even raised his glass, and satfor some minutes oblivious of everything and everyone except one centralfigure. Very quietly and without attracting Basil's attention, ColonelMostyn raised his glass and looked at the box. His gaze was steadfastfor some minutes, then he gave utterance to a prolonged sigh."That will do," he said to himself.Like the diplomatist that he was, Colonel Mostyn said never a word, butwhen the act was ended, he turned to Basil."I see a lady, an old friend of mine, and I am going to spend a fewminutes with her."He went to the box, and had the satisfaction of seeing that Basil neverremoved his glass. When he returned to his own seat, the heir ofUlverston said, somewhat eagerly:"Who is that lady, colonel, with whom you have been speaking?""My dear boy," he replied, "one chignon is just like another; which doyou mean?""There is no chignon in this case. I mean the lady with whom you havebeen speaking.""That is Lady Amelie Lisle," he replied, briefly."Amelie Lisle!" repeated Basil; "but who is she?""If you wish to know her pedigree, you must consult Burke's Peerage. Ican only remember that she is the daughter of Lord Grayson, who marrieda French duchess, and rumor says she is the loveliest and mostaccomplished woman in England.""Is she married?" was the next question."Yes; she married Lord Lisle, and rumor, always busy with beautifulwomen, says again that she is not too happy. Do you know Lord Lisle?""No; I do not remember having ever seen him.""When you do, you will realize what it is for a man to be all animal. Heeats well, sleeps well, drinks well; he rides out a great deal in thefresh air; he is tall and portly, never, perhaps, read a book through inhis life, good humored, generous in his way, but obstinate as a--well,as a woman.""And is that lovely lady married to such a man?""Yes; the lovely lady was very young, and perhaps his fortune temptedher. She is all fire and poetry, plays with passion as children playwith sharp knives.""Will you introduce me?" asked Basil Carruthers."My dear Basil," replied the wily diplomatist, with an air of assumedfrankness, "I really do not think you would like her. She is fond ofballs, of dancing, of all sorts of amusements that you despise. If Iintroduce you to anybody at all, it must be to Minerva in disguise.""I should not like Minerva," was the abrupt reply."Well, as you seem anxious, I will undertake it. We are going to theDuchess of Hexham's ball tomorrow evening. Lady Amelie Lisle is sure tobe there--no grand ball is complete without her. She is so surroundednow. I hardly like to interrupt her. Are you going to the Hexham ball?"Now Basil had said no, he should certainly decline the invitation, buthe seemed to forget it."Certainly I shall go," he said."Ah, then we shall see her there," replied the colonel, and his longmustache concealed the triumphant smile with which he listened to thewords.CHAPTER VIII.Lady Amelie at Home.The poets of old must have been thinking of a woman like Lady Ameliewhen they wrote of circes and sirens, and women whose beauty has provedfatal to men. It is perhaps quite as well that they are very rare--thepower of a beautiful woman is great. If she be good, and use it for agood purpose; the world is the better for it. If she be bad, and herbeauty is simply used as a lure, the world is the worse for it.Either for good or evil, the power of Lady Amelie was great, for a moreroyally beautiful woman had seldom been seen. She was the very ideal ofglowing, luxurious loveliness, and her beauty was perhaps the least ofher charms. She had that wonderful gift of fascination which makes evena plain woman irresistible. Allied to beauty so wondrous as hers, it wasfatal.It is morning, and Lady Amelie, fresh and radiant as a June rose, is inher boudoir, an exquisite little room, hung with pink silk and whitelace; the windows were draped with pink silk, and the light that camethrough was subdued and rosy, the fairest of all lights in which to seea fair woman.A gem of a room, from which a painter would have made a room glowing inluxurious color. The air was heavy with the perfume of white hyacinthsand daphnes--the jardinieres were filled with the sweetest of flowers;Lady Amelie loved them so well; she was never so pleased as when in themidst of them. There was a marble Flora, whose hands were filled withpurple heliotropes--in fact, every beauty that money, taste or luxurycould suggest, was there. Pale pink was a color that Lady Amelieloved--her chairs and couches were covered with it. She is sitting nowin a pretty, fantastic chair, the subdued rosy light of the room fallingfull upon her. She is reading the fashionable daily paper, smiling assome on dits meet her eye. Surely such beauty as that should beimmortal. No wonder that Basil Carruthers, whose eyes had never restedlong on a woman's face before, should not weary of hers.It is the beauty of an empress, royal, commanding, statuesque, yetradiant and full of grace. Her figure, as she reclines, is perfection;the soft, flowing lines, the gracious curves, the free, unfetteredgrace, the queenly dignity, all combined, enchant one. The head, whosecontour is simply perfect, is crowned with a mass of dark hair, shininglike the lustrous wing of some rare bird. The brow is white, rounded atthe temples and clear as the leaf of the lily. The brows are straight,delicate and have in them wonderful expression. But it was Lady Amelie'seyes that drew men so irresistibly to her feet. They were irresistible.Black, with a languid, golden light in their wondrous depths; full ofveiled fire and repressed passion. They could melt and flash, persuadeand command, as no other eyes did. No man ever looked into their depthswithout losing himself there. Her mouth was no less beautiful, tenderand sensitive; yet those lovely lips could curl with scorn that witheredand pride that crashed.She knew that she was beautiful, and she rejoiced in her beauty, as thelion in his strength or the serpent in its cunning. Men she looked uponas her natural vassals, her subjects, her lawful prey. She never once,in the whole course of her triumphant life, paused to think whether ornot she inflicted pain. If any one had said to her, abruptly, "You havemade such a person suffer," she would have laughed gaily. The ache andpain of honest hearts is incense to a coquette.And Lady Amelie Lisle was a coquette to the very depth of her heart! Shecould have counted her victims by the hundred. Who ever saw her and didnot love her? She delighted in this universal worship; it becamenecessary to her as the air she breathed. Universal dominion was her endand aim; but once sure of a man's love or admiration, it becameworthless to her and she longed for something fresh. Like Alexander, shewould have conquered worlds.Not, be it understood, that Lady Amelie, as she expressed it, "ever wentin for anything serious." She had never been in love in her life, exceptwith herself, and to that one affection she was most constant. Sheaccepted all, but gave none. Once or twice her flirtations had been onthe verge, but Lady Amelie was one of those who can look very steadilyover the brink but never fall in.The world spoke well of her. "She was certainly a great coquette,"people said, indulgently, but then she was so beautiful and so muchadmired. She smiles as she reads the fashionable intelligence; there isa paragraph describing her appearance at a ball given by one of thequeens of society. The paper speaks of her beauty, her magnificent dressand costly jewels. She remembered all the homage, the sighs, thewhispered words, the honeyed compliments, smiled and thought how sweetlife was.At that moment her maid entered. "My lady," she said. "Colonel Mostynwould be so much obliged if you could see him. It is on importantbusiness.""Certainly. I will see him here," she replied. "What can he want withme?" thought my lady. "He was very empresse last night; surely he is notgoing to make love to me."And the notion of a gray-haired lover piqued her and made her smileagain.The colonel entered with the most courtly of bows, and she received himgraciously. He talked of the opera, of the ball, of the last new novel,of the latest marriage on the tapis, and all the time Lady Lisle'sbeautiful eyes were looking at him. "It was not for this you came," shethought. At last the colonel spoke openly."I have come to ask of you a great favor, Lady Lisle," he said. "Youhave perhaps heard of my young kinsman, Basil Carruthers?""The heir of Ulverston?" she said. "Certainly. He is one of the prizesin the matrimonial market at present, colonel."Colonel Mostyn drew a very animated and interesting portrait of hisyoung charge."He wants modernizing; his ideas are dated two hundred years back. LadyLisle, there is no one who could work such wonders for him as you.""What could I do?" she asked, with a conscious smile."You could modernize him and humanize him. Will you allow me tointroduce him to you? And will you take him in hand a little--teach himsomething of life as it is, not as he dreams of it?""What if he burns his wings, like many other silly moths?" she asked,laughingly."It would do him all the good in the world," he replied, withenthusiasm. "Will you believe, Lady Lisle, that he never admired anyone, not even Lady Evelyn Hope? He never admired any face until he sawyours last evening." That piqued her. "I have never seen anything likehis indifference to all ladies. Dear Lady Lisle, you are the brilliantsun that alone can melt this icicle. I assure you, that his mother andmyself are in despair.""You must not blame me," she said, "for whatever happens. You choose torun the risk.""Nothing can happen but what will be for his greatest good," said thecolonel, gallantly."You may introduce him to me," said Lady Amelie, "and I will do the bestI can for him.""You will be at the Duchess of Hexham's ball this evening?" he asked."Yes," she replied. "You have described your charge, Colonel Mostyn; nowI know the carte du pays. It would be better not to mention having seenme.""Certainly not"--"Let me see," she interrupted. "I am to teach him what life is like inthis nineteenth century, to try to inoculate him with modern ideas; toteach him how to appreciate the society of ladies; he shall learn hislesson well."There was something in her peerless face and her brilliant smile thatmade Colonel Mostyn pause, and wonder if after all he had done a wisething."The boy cannot be hurt," he said to himself; "he has too much sense tofall in love with a married lady. A violent flirtation will do him good,and cure him of his absurd ideas.""Your ladyship will be the benefactress of the whole family if you canrescue our young hero, and help us make him in some degree fit for theage he lives in."Lady Amelie smiled; there was not much fear in her failing in anythingshe undertook."It is not often that young men err on the side of originality andsingularity," she said; "I have always considered realism the sin of theage. I am quite curious to see your hero, Colonel Mostyn.""I believe he is quite as anxious to see you, Lady Lisle; he positivelyasked me to introduce him to you, and that is a request he has nevermade before, though I have shown him some beautiful women.""I ought to feel flattered," said Lady Amelie, and again there wassomething in her smile that made the colonel wonder whether he had doneamiss."We are quite in a conspiracy," he said, and Lady Lisle laughinglyassured him that all women were fond of plots."Your sex, my dear colonel, are so strong and so wise that it is a realpleasure to any poor weak woman to outwit you." And Lady Amelie shot hima glance from her beautiful eyes that made the colonel again half pityhis young kinsman.CHAPTER IX.Weaving the Spell.The Duchess of Hexham bore the reputation of being a most accomplishedwoman; if she excelled in anything it was certainly the giving of balls.She had the largest, loftiest and best ball-room in London. It was neverovercrowded."As many flowers as possible," she was in the habit of saying; "but wemust limit our guests."It did not matter either who was fashionable and who was not, theduchess would have nothing but beauty and grace at her balls. You weresure at Hexham House to meet the most beautiful women in London and themost eligible men. It was consequently agreed on all sides that hergrace gave the best balls during the season. This one at which LadyAmelie was to be present, promised unusual splendor.An archduke of one of the European courts was just then the guest of thequeen, and he had promised to honor Hexham House with his presence."He shall see such lovely women," said the duchess to her husband, "thathe shall go back to his own country in despair."To Lady Amelie she had said, laughingly: "Look your very loveliest. Iwant you to make a conquest of the archduke."And that queen of coquettes thought to herself that her hands on thateventful evening would indeed be full. Not one word did the diplomaticold colonel say to Basil, but that young man was not quite himself. Hehad been wonderfully attracted by Lady Lisle's face; he read poetry,love of romance and everything else beautiful and piquant in it. Of allthe women he had seen she was the only one who had interested him. Hewondered whether the mind matched the peerless face. She must be clever,witty, brilliant, he thought, or she would not have kept all those menenchained as she did. He was very anxious to see her again."If she is like everyone else," he said, "I shall soon be disenchanted,but if she speaks as she looks, she will indeed be peerless amongwomen."He longed for the evening. He said nothing of her, but he talked soincessantly of the Duchess of Hexham, that the colonel understoodexactly where his thoughts were, and smiled again most knowingly tohimself.He looked at his young kinsman in his faultless evening dress, and saidto himself that there was not in all England a more noble or handsomeman.Lady Amelie called all the skill of the milliner to her aid; her dresswas superb and effective--gold flowers on a white ground--a dress thatirresistibly reminded one of sunbeams; it fell around her in statuesquefolds that would have driven a sculptor to despair. Her beautiful neckand white arms were bare. She wore a diamond necklace of almostpriceless value; her dark, shining hair was crowned with a circlet ofthe same royal stones; a diamond bracelet clasped one rounded arm. Asshe moved the light shone on her dress and gleamed on her jewels, untilone was dazed with her splendor.Lady Amelie was very particular about her flowers. On this evening, withher costly dress and magnificent jewels, she would have nothing butwhite daphnes. Did she know that the sweet, subtle fragrance of a daphnereaches the senses long before the odor of other flowers touches them?As she surveyed herself in the mirror, she felt devoutly satisfied."I shall be able to convert Basil Carruthers, Esq., to anything I like,"she said; "if he has resisted all the world, he will yield to me."So she drove off, resplendent, happy, animated, ready for the weaving ofher spells.Any good Christian, seeing her pass by with that triumphant smile on herlovely face, might have prayed their nearest and dearest should be keptfrom harm.Lady Amelie never arrived very early at a ball. She liked to make herentree when most of the other guests were assembled. It was sweet to herto see how sorry and shy the ladies looked at her arrival, and how thefaces of the men brightened. The first thing, of course, when shearrived at Hexham House, was the archduke. It was wonderful to watch thevarious phases of character that she could assume at will. With thearchduke, she was the brilliant woman of the world, witty, sarcastic,adorable. He was enchanted with her; he declared that she combined allthe charms of English and French women; he danced with her and wouldfain have lingered by her side, but that etiquette called him away.Then Lady Amelie, already the belle of the ball, looked up, for ColonelMostyn was standing before her, and by his side one of the handsomestand noblest young men she had ever seen. He introduced Basil Carruthersto his fate.She looked in his face with a smile, and drawing aside a fold of hersumptuous dress, made room for him to sit near her.He thought her even more dazzlingly beautiful than when he had seen herat the opera. The perfume of the white daphnes must have touched hissenses as those most lovely eyes smiled into his; his brain seemed toreel; he was intoxicated with her beauty as some men are with the fumesof rare wine.Colonel Mostyn lingered for a few minutes, then, well satisfied, wentaway, leaving Basil and Lady Amelie together. She had taken her seatunder the shade of a magnificent mass of gorgeous, blooming flowers,with wondrous leaves and rich perfume. As she sat with her gleamingdress and jewels showing to perfection, from against this beautifulbackground, Basil was completely charmed. In all his life he had nevereven seen such a picture. She turned to him, when they were alone, withthe sweetest smile on her lovely lips; her eyes seemed to rain downlight into his."This is a brilliant scene, Mr. Carruthers; the duchess excels in thearrangement of her rooms."He made some reply; he never quite knew what it was. It was enough forhim to watch the charm of that irresistible face as she spoke. "Ofcourse, everything depends on taste," she continued; "I quite expect youto laugh at me, but do you know what scene I should find much morebrilliant than this?""I cannot imagine," he replied; "but I shall not laugh.""Ah, well. I am peculiar in my tastes. In place of this brilliantballroom, I should like to be seated at a tournament. I should like tosee the knights with their banners and waving plumes, in the lists--theladies in their balconies all hung with cloth of gold--the queen ofbeauty with the prize. Ah, me! in those days, ladies had knights and menwere heroes."As he looked at her, his whole soul shone in his eyes."And I, too," he cried. "I love those days ten thousand times betterthan these.""Do you?" asked her ladyship with admiring eyes, "how strange! It is notlong since I was speaking to one whom I may call a young man of theperiod, and his reply was, 'Horrid bore, those kind of things were, LadyLisle,' and I thought most young men were of his opinion.""I am not," said Basil, "I love those knights and heroes of old! greatmen and grand men who were content to ride forth, and to battle untodeath for a woman's smile."She raised her radiant eyes to his."Would you do that much for a woman's smile, Mr. Carruthers?"He paused a moment before speaking, then said: "For one such woman asthose men loved, I would." She sighed deeply; the jewels on her whitebreast gleamed and glistened."Ah, you think, then, that the glorious race of women heroes loved anddied for, have disappeared?""I thought so, until I saw you," he replied."You are wrong," she said. "You will live to tell me that you are wrong.There may be no Helen such as she who lived at Troy, and no Cleopatrasuch as Egypt's dusky queen, but there are grand women living yet,worthy of heroes' love.""I am sure of it," he said, "now that I have seen you."But she made no reply; she did not even appear to have heard his words."I can understand you," she said, gently. "Women have sometimes the raregift of entering into the minds of reserved men. I understand you asthough I had known you for years."His face cleared, his heart beat, his eyes brightened for her as theyhad never done for any other woman."I can remember," she said, "when I had many similar opinions. I used tothink these, our present days of steam and progress, quite unfit forheroes; I used to long for olden times again, when, by one great deed, aman made a great name."His eyes shone with new fire as he looked at her; it seemed to him thathe had found his other soul at last. His mother laughed at him; MarionHautville was sarcastic to him, but this beautiful woman--thismagnificent queen at whose feet men bowed--she not only sympathized withhim, but she had the self-same ideas."The great thing that I complain of," said Lady Amelie, "is that therereally seems in these days nothing to do. You, for instance, supposingthat you were ambitious, how would you distinguish yourself?"And as she asked the question, my lady gave a sidelong look at hervictim and was charmed to see the progress she had made.CHAPTER X.Deeper and Deeper Still.It was not possible that the queen of the ball should be allowed to sitapart from the dancers long. Many curious glances were bent on the pairwho sat before the grand tier of fragrant blossoms."Who is that with Lady Amelie?" asked one of another."Mr. Carruthers of Ulverston," was the, reply; and great was theindignation felt by young ladies and their mammas.Poor Lady Masham had five marriageable daughters, and none had as yetreceived even the faintest shadow of an offer. In her own mind she hadthought of Mr. Carruthers as especially eligible for one of them, andhad resolved, when he did go more into society, upon a decided mode ofattack. Her dismay, when she saw the state of things, can be betterimagined than described."My dear," she said to her friend and confidant, Mrs. Scrops, "look,only look! Lady Amelie has victimized Mr. Carruthers.""She cannot do him any harm," replied Mrs. Scrops; "she is married, I amthankful to say.""There will be no good done with him this season," said poor LadyMasham. "I would rather he had fallen in love than that she tookpossession of him."But Basil was not allowed to remain very long tete-a-tete with hischarming queen. The Duchess of Hexham, alarmed lest her most brilliantstar should be eclipsed, came to the rescue. Lady Amelie was soonsurrounded, and then was carried off by the archduke.Not, however, before she had managed to turn round to Basil and say tohim, sotto voce, "You must call and see me. We shall be friends, I canforetell." And he was more charmed than ever by those words. Friendswith that enchanting woman, that proud, peerless queen, that radiantbeauty! Be friends with her! It was more than he had dared to venture tohope. That he might worship her in the distance seemed to him honorenough.He had dreamed of such women, but he had not thought they existed; theybelonged to the heroic ages, past now and dead. Here, in the midst ofthe days he considered so degenerate, he had found the very ideal of hisheart.The brilliant scene before him seemed to fade away. Ah! if there was butsome faint chance of distinguishing himself for her sake!--if she werebut a princess in distress!--a lady for whom he could enter the listsand fight until he won! What was there in this prosaic century that hecould do for her?--literally nothing but give her flowers."Basil! Basil! my dear boy," said a voice near him. "Pray excuse me, butwhat are you doing here? Dreaming in a ballroom? This will not do."And Basil, aroused from his dream, looked up to see the face of ColonelMostyn, wearing an expression of perfect horror."Do rouse up, Basil! Do, for heaven's sake, try to be like every oneelse! Lady Masham wishes to know you; come with me."Basil followed, like a victim. Lady Masham received him cordially,mentioned casually that she had been to school with his mother,therefore felt called upon to take a special interest in himself, andthen, very kindly, introduced him to her youngest daughter, Miss Nellie,whom she pathetically called the flower of her flock. Miss Nellie was apretty girl, as were all the Misses Masham, or they would not havefigured at her grace's ball. She wore the regulation chignon, goldenbrown in her case, her eyes were blue, her lips rosy and sweet, her facefair as the lilies and roses of summer. They had all been brought upafter the same pattern; they all knew exactly what to say in every caseand how to say it. As a matter of course, and not, it is to be feared,because he felt the least inclination, Basil asked the young lady todance, and Miss Nellie, with the prettiest pink flush on her cheek,consented.She talked about the rooms, the opera, the archduke, until Basil almostgroaned aloud. There was his beautiful queen, with her face full ofpoetry and her eyes of love. Yet if he could but have had both hearts,he would have seen that pretty, simple Nellie Masham, who talkedinnocent little commonplaces to him, was worth a thousand of such womenas Lady Amelie Lisle. But it is not given to men to see clearly;anything but that. When Basil Carruthers had finished that dance helonged to escape, lest he should be compelled to go through another.Then came another moment of rapture for him, when, from the midst of acrowd of courtiers, Lady Amelie summoned him to take her to hercarriage. Already they seemed like old friends. Basil drew the laceshawl around the white shoulders and held her flowers."You have told me I may call," he said; "will you tell me when?""I am visible any time after two," said Lady Amelie. Not for any amountof love or homage would she forego her comforts. Then it seemed to himthat the world stopped until two the next day. He went back to theballroom, but its beauty had all departed--there was no soul in themusic, no fragrance in the flowers."Colonel," he said, "I have had quite enough of the ball. Are you readyfor home?"The colonel, who was quite satisfied with the result of the night'swork, declared that he also was ready, and they went."A very pleasant ball," remarked the diplomatist, as they drove home."Was it?" said Basil dreamily. "I did not notice much--the only part ofit I enjoyed was the conversation I had with Lady Lisle. Ah, colonel, ifthe ladies of the present day resembled her, there would be some hopefor chivalry.""God forbid," thought the colonel to himself. Aloud he replied: "Yes,she is a very beautiful and most accomplished woman.""She is more than that; she has a touch of genius and fire and poetry. Ihave met no one like her.""I can only hope," thought Colonel Mostyn, "he will not take the diseasetoo severely. I want a difference, but I do not care to have a case ofraving love and madness on my hands."At breakfast time the next morning, Colonel Mostyn was pleased to seethat, for the first time, Basil eagerly opened the papers and spokeanxiously of the evening engagements."Better rest at home, tonight," said the colonel; "you were out lastevening, and going out much tires you, I know. What do you say to aquiet game at chess?""I cannot say positively. I shall not know what my evening engagementsare until dinner-time."And then the colonel felt quite relieved. "He is going to call on LadyAmelie," he thought, "and wherever she goes this evening he will follow.I shall soon see him like other young men."As for Basil himself, he simply lived in one longing for two o'clock. Mylady was perfectly ready to receive him. She had arranged a little sceneand smiled to herself as she thought how sure it was to succeed."He saw me all magnificence last evening; now I will play a differentrole."She wore a plain dress of some white flowing material, with a knot ofscarlet ribbons on her fair neck; her shining hair was drawn from herwhite brow and fell in luxuriant waves; in it she wore one rose halfshrouded in green leaves, and never in all her gorgeous magnificence hadLady Amelie looked one-half as fair. She was seated in her own boudoir,where the white daphnes shone like stars in the rosy light. A picturethat would have ravished the heart of any man that gazed upon it, andLady Amelie knew that it was perfect, even down to the graceful attitudeand half sad, half languid expression of her face.It was not much after two when he came. Her reception of him wasperfect--unstudied, graceful, natural; and he looking at her, thoughther more beautiful than ever."You were reading," he said; "have I disturbed you?""No; Owen Meredith is a favorite poet of mine; there is something veryunworldly and beautiful about his verses.""That is why you like them--you are so unworldly yourself.""Perhaps so, in one sense. I have just sufficient tinge of it about meto teach me that whatever are my thoughts and opinions, if they differmuch from other people's, I must keep them to myself, unless, as is thecase now, I meet a congenial soul."A view of the subject which was quite new to Basil."I thought originality was a sign of genius," he replied, "and thatpeople admired it."She smiled with an air of superiority that left him miles behind."My observation teaches me that there is nothing worldly peopledisapprove of so highly as originality," she said. "To be more cleverthan your neighbor is a crime they never pardon."Basil, drinking in the beauty of that marvelous face, and the light ofthose lovely eyes, learned more worldly wisdom in one hour from thelovely lips of Lady Amelie than he had ever learned before.CHAPTER XI.How the Plot Succeeded.Colonel Mostyn had no longer any reason to complain of his youngkinsman; it was a month since he had been introduced to Lady Amelie, andhe had lived in one long dream. He no longer found the time wearisome,or longed for something to do. He was in the power of a beautiful andheartless coquette, who took care that he should not lightly wear herchains.He no longer showed any indifference to his evening engagements; to bewith her was the one wish of his life; where she went, he went--to ball,opera, soiree, concert, fete, to dinners at Richmond, to water-parties;whoever saw the beautiful Lady Amelie, saw her last victim with her.Colonel Mostyn began to think that really matters had been carried quitefar enough; all the good he had anticipated was done; he did not wishevil to follow, and he was beginning to scheme for his young kinsman'srescue, when he was suddenly summoned to join his regiment, just orderedabroad, and Basil was left to his fate.He gave him some parting words of advice, but they fell on deaf ears.Even had Basil quite understood them, he would have asked how was itpossible for a matter-of-fact, prosaic soldier like Colonel Mostyn, aman of the world, to understand such transcendental beings as LadyAmelie and himself.During the whole of this time, believe me, he had no thought of harm orwrong; he never dreamed of being in love with Lady Amelie. What was sheto him? His queen, his lode-star, his inspiration to all that was greatand glorious, the Lama to his Petrarch; but of anything less exalted, hehad no notion. Basil Carruthers, with all his eccentricity, would haveshuddered at the bare notion of dishonorable love or sin. He was anenthusiast, a dreamer, a poet in heart and soul, but he was not the manto betray a woman; he scorned the notion of such a sin; it was utterlybeneath his lofty nature. How skilfully she managed him! How artfullyshe contrived to lead him on, to engage his whole thought, time andattention, yet never to lose her influence for one moment!Take a scene from her life and his. A bright, beautiful summer day,when, with a large party of friends, they had gone down to Richmond.When dinner was over, and the sweet, soft gloaming lay over the earth,Lady Amelie left the room, where the guests were lingering over the wineand grapes, and went out into the balcony that overlooked the green parkand the smooth, clear water.Seeing that, and feeling tired of the conversation, Basil followed her.She was leaning over the stone balustrade, and the green foliagewreathed round the balcony formed a beautiful frame-work for a lovelypicture. He went up to her, and stood in silence by her side."How different these two worlds are!" she said. "The world in there, allheat, noise and frivolity; the world out here, so calm, so grand andstill. Look at the shadow of the trees in the water! Look at thefloating clouds of rose-colored light in the sky!"But he thought nothing in that outside world so beautiful as sheherself."Are you found of German stories?" he asked her, suddenly."Yes, some of them. I like the mystery and the spirituality, the poetryand the romance.""I read a book of Fouque's last night that charmed me--Minstrel Love. Doyou know it, Lady Amelie?""No," she replied; "tell me what it is.""Only the history of a poet-knight who loved the lofty Lady Alcarda. Shelived with her husband, a German warrior, in an old castle, and the poetwas her knight."Do you know, Lady Amelie," he whispered, "that book made me ambitious?""Of what?" she asked."Dare I tell you? The Lady Alcarda was beautiful, gifted, pure of heartand soul, lofty and spiritual--like you," he added, passionately, "andshe accepted the poet's service--she made him her knight.""There are no knights in these days," she said, half sadly."Ah! let me prove to you that you are wrong. You are like Lady Alcarda.Let me be your knight. I would be content to serve you in all chivalry,and in all honor, until death, if you would reward me with a kind wordand a smile."His handsome young face looked so eager, so wistful, that the coquette'sheart smote her for one half moment. Knowing what was before him, was itnot too cruel to lead him on? But the short-lived feeling of compunctionsoon died. She bent her head and the perfume of the flowers she carriedreached him."Would you be my knight?" she said; "would you go through danger andperil to serve me?""I would die for you," he replied, simply; "quite content, if you smiledon me as I died.""Do you mean it, without any romance or nonsense? Seriously, would you,to serve me?""Yes: and count all loss as gain.""Then you shall be my knight, my friend. I am not a queen. I have nosword to lay on your shoulder, but I place my hand in yours, and Iaccept your loyal service."She laid her white hand in his, and the touch of those slender fingersthrilled him as nothing had ever done before."I am your sovereign liege," she said, with a smile. "If I come to youin distress you are sworn, remember, to help me. If I require yourservice, it is mine.""Yes," he said; "at all times and at all hours.""I shall go through life the more happily for knowing that I have sotrue and chivalrous a defender," she replied.And they sat in the flower-wreathed balcony, watching the sun set overthe river, and the simple, dreaming boy believed himself in Paradise.It seemed to him that the spell was broken when the other guests cameout and joined them. As he could no longer talk to Lady Amelie, he wascontent to stand by himself and think over his own happiness. To him itwas like a beautiful page from some old romance, that this lovely ladyshould have smiled upon him, and have laid her gracious hand upon him,calling him her knight. How insufferable the empty talk of the menaround him seemed! Ah, if they knew how he was sworn to do the lady'sservice!It was more than an hour afterward when Lady Lisle was free again; thenhe enjoyed the felicity of helping her with her shawls, and of sittingby her side while they drove home in the moonlight.Lady Amelie was the very queen of coquettes. In the course of all herlong experience, she had never, through all her flirtations, said oneword too much. But no other woman living could imply so much by agesture, a look or an exclamation. One morning Basil had called early,in the hope of escorting her to an exhibition of paintings. He found heralone, and while he was talking to her, a gentleman entered the room--atall, portly, sensual-looking man, whom Basil disliked at first sight.Lady Amelie introduced him to her husband, Lord Lisle, who was verycordial in his greeting."Lady Lisle has often spoken of you," he said; "but this is, strange tosay, the first time I have ever had the pleasure of seeing you. I metyour mother, Lady Carruthers, a year ago, and have a most pleasantrecollection of her."Lord Lisle sat down, and Lady Amelie gave a pretty little sigh,expressive of her resignation to something unpleasant.And truly a conversation with Lord Lisle was about as unpleasant amatter as one could well experience. His language was coarse; his ideascoarser still. There was very little to redeem it. He mistook slang forwit, told stories that made his wife shudder, and misbehaved himself asonly such a man can do.Basil looked at him in dismay. Could it be possible that this man wasthe husband of that queen of beauty? What a life for her! No wonder shelooked sad as she sat listening to him! The young man's heart ached forher."Are you engaged this evening?" asked Lord Lisle; "if not, dine with us.I expect Sir Harry Vere, and he is the most amusing character I know."He would have refused, but that he met the imploring glance of LadyAmelie's eyes."I will come with pleasure," he replied; and her eyes thanked him.Then Lord Lisle, thinking he had been most amiable and charming, rosefrom his chair and quitted the room. In some vague, indistinct way theatmosphere seemed clearer after he had gone.Lady Amelie made no comment; a woman less gifted than herself might havedone so; she merely raised her hands and eyes and gave one deep sigh.Will you believe me that that sigh meant more than any other woman couldhave put into words? It meant "Pity me! see how I am wasted on this boorof a man! think how uncongenial he is, how wretched I am."No one could sigh so effectively as Lady Amelie Lisle; thus it was withdifficulty she refrained from smiling. Basil looked so wretchedlyanxious and uncomfortable, she saw that he was longing to say something,but dare not."I shall not be five minutes," she said, with a graceful little smile;"and then we can spend a long hour with the pictures."CHAPTER XII.Caught in the Snare.The first part of that hour was charming. Basil never forgot it; therooms were not crowded, the pictures beautiful, and Lady Amelie in oneof her most graceful moods. They both stood before a little gem by oneof our first English artists, called "The Coquette's Decision," a verypretty picture that told its own story. A young girl, standing, halfhesitating between two gentlemen. They looked anxious, she smiling andtriumphant. She inclined ever so little to the fair-haired youth on theright, her eyes and lips smiling on him, but her hand was extended tohis dark-haired rival on the left."I do not like that kind of picture," said Basil, "it lowers one's idealof woman. I do not think there is one-half so much coquetry in the worldas people would make you believe.""Perhaps you never knew a coquette," she said; and the look she gave himfrom underneath those long lashes was quite irresistible."No," he replied; "indeed, a coquette could never charm me. My ideal ofwoman is some one as lofty, grand, beautiful and gifted as you.""Yet there are coquettes," she said, gravely."I do not doubt it. I only say there would be no charm for me in thefairest of them all."Just then two gentlemen entered at the other end of the room, and theslight noise made by their entrance caused Lady Amelie to look up.Basil, who was watching her every movement, as he always did,attentively, saw her turn very pale and a sudden cloud of fear dimmedthe radiance of her eyes."Lady Amelie, you are ill!" he cried; "or tired.""I am tired," she said, and they sat down on one of the seats, placedin the middle of the room. It struck him that she was anxiously tryingto conceal herself from observation, yet the idea seemed absurd.In the meantime, the two gentlemen advanced slowly up the room. They,too, paused before "The Coquette's Decision," and laughed. Then one,leaving his companion, came hastily to the seat where Lady Amelie wassitting. He held out his hand as though surprised and delighted."Lady Amelie!" he said. "I felt sure that I was not mistaken--that itmust be you."There was no answering delight on her face; nothing but constraint,embarrassment and confusion."How do you do, Count Jules?" she said, coldly. "This is an unexpectedsurprise. I thought you had left London for some years.""L'homme propose, Dieu dispose," said the count. "I only reached Englandlast night, and have hurried to London.""It is strange that I should meet you here," she said."My friend, Monsieur Le Blanc, has a picture here, and I have beencriticising it for him."Then Lady Amelie seemed to remember the laws of politeness, for sheintroduced the two gentlemen, who looked very unpleasantly at eachother.Basil did not like the count, although at first sight he was certainly avery handsome man, essentially French, with a quick, shrewd, handsomeface and dark hair, eyes black as night, yet bright and eloquent. It wasthose very eyes that Basil disliked; they were not clear, true norhonest. In fact, a sudden hatred to the French count sprang up in hisheart, he could not tell how or why. They exchanged a few words, andthen, under pretense of drawing Lady Amelie's attention to a picture,Count Jules said to her:"Can you not dismiss your young cavalier? I have come to London onpurpose to see you--I must speak to you.""I cannot dismiss him," she said, curtly. "He is not a footman to besent away at my pleasure. Tell me in few words what you want.""I want money!" he said, with a very dark frown; "and money, Amelie, Imust have.""I can give you none--you have no conscience. How much have you hadalready?""I have kept no account." he replied; "and really what I have had is notof the least consequence--it is what I have to get.""That will be nothing from me," she replied. "I gave you a thousandpounds three months ago, and you promised you would ask for no more.""I did not foresee the present necessity," he said. "Amelie, I must havemoney.""Count Jules," said Lady Lisle, "you are a villain, who trades upon awoman's fears!""My charming lady shall call me anything she will, but I must have themoney.""I tell you," she replied, angrily, "that I have not got it, nor is itany use asking my lord for it; he was angry the last time, and I shallask him no more.""Then get it from some other source.""There is no other source open to me," she replied.The count's face darkened angrily."There need not be so many words about it, Lady Lisle. I must have themoney.""By what right do you incessantly demand money from me?" she asked."You promised, in those happier days, to be my friend always; and as afriend you have lent me money often. As a friend, I ask you for itagain.""And as a friend," she retorted, "I refuse.""Then I shall be obliged to adopt the very unpleasant alternative ofasking it from Lord Lisle.""Lord Lisle would refuse it.""He would give it to me as the means of purchasing my silence," he said."You forget, Lady Amelie, what I have to show Lord Lisle, if he doesrefuse?""You mean my letters?" she said, indignantly. "You are coward enough tothreaten me with showing my husband the letters I was so mistaken as towrite to you?""I should be deeply grieved, indeed," he said, "but I have no otheralternative.""And I mistook you for a gentleman," she said, with calm scorn."You were very kind to me, Lady Amelie," he said, with a polite sneer."I do not believe you have those letters," she said."I have, indeed. I have locked them up with the only two familyheirlooms I possess--a watch and a ring--in an ivory casket, and I gonowhere without it.""You must do your worst!" said Lady Amelie."Nay," he said, "I do not wish to do that. My worst would be to bringthe honored name of Lady Amelie Lisle into the divorce court, and that Ishould not like to do. Do not decide hastily. I cannot remain in Englandvery long. Take a week to decide in and let me know when I am to havethe money."She turned from him with the scornful gesture of an outraged queen."We shall see," she muttered between her white teeth. "We shall see."She spoke no other word to him, but went back to her seat. Count Julesbowed and quitted the room."You do not like that man, Lady Lisle?" said Basil, as he looked at herfair, flushed face. Before she had time to answer, they were joined bysome ladies of his acquaintance, and were not able to exchange anotherword on the subject. As he was leaving, Lady Lisle looked out of thecarriage."Mr. Carruthers!" she said. He was by her side in a moment. She was paleand agitated, not quite herself."You are my sworn knight," she said, laying her hand on his."Until death!" he replied."You promised to help me at any risk, in any difficulty, and now I amgoing to ask your aid.""It is yours. My whole life is yours," he cried. She smiled, sadly."There are some things more valuable than life. Perhaps what I ask fromyou will cost you dear.""I do not care in the least what it costs," he said."You are coming to dine with us; we do not dine this evening untileight. Come soon after six. I have a story to tell you.""I will not fail," he replied. "Do not be anxious, Lady Lisle, you lookdistressed. Trust in me; far as human aid can go, mine is yours."His clear blue eyes lingered on her perfect face, and again, for thesecond time in her life, the queen of coquettes felt something like pityfor the man she was luring to his doom. She leaned back in the carriageafter he was gone, with a most triumphant smile on her lips."What wonders a pretty face can work," she thought. "I feel quite safe,now that my troubles are to rest on his broad shoulders. How I shouldlike to see that Jules trampled upon and crushed. My knight will saveme."She never remembered that he was the only son of his mother--a widow.She cared little that he was the head of a grand old race. She thoughtstill less of his talents, his honest enthusiasm, his simplicity, exceptso far as it answered her purpose.CHAPTER XIII.Ladie Amelie's Story.A few hours later, and Lady Lisle was seated in her boudoir, exquisitelyattired. She, who knew so well the effect of every fold in her dress, ofevery flower she wore or carried; she, who had studied the art oflooking beautiful more completely than any other woman, had notneglected her most potent charm. She wore a dinner dress of white silk,with crimson flowers, that suited her dark, glowing beauty toperfection. An elegant toilet! No jewels, but a massive golden braceleton one arm, and a golden chain of exquisite workmanship round her neck."I knew you would come," she said, looking up with a smile as Basil wasshown into her boudoir; "I knew you would not fail me. We shall havetime for a long conversation. Lord Lisle never reaches home until aquarter of an hour before dinner, and then he has to hurry. Our guestswill not arrive until nearly eight, so we shall not be interrupted."He looked round that little fairy nook, wondering at its elegance,wondering at the soft, rosy light, at the fragrance of the whitedaphnes, but more than all at the queenly loveliness of the beautifulwoman before him.She sat in the very heart of the crimson glow, her glistening silkendress sweeping in rich waves, and quite sure that her attitude, likeeverything else about her, was perfect. She held out her hand to him,with a smile that would have bewildered any man older and wiser than he."Sit down here," she said, pointing to a velvet fauteuil; "I am going tomake you my judge. Ah, Basil, for this one night I may call you Basil;perhaps after you have heard what I have to say, you will never be myknight again; it may change you.""I shall belong to you, and ask no greater happiness than to serve youuntil I die," he replied,A fan lay on the table by her side, with jeweled handle, and made ofwhite, soft feathers. She opened it and quietly stirred the warm,perfumed air."I could only tell my trouble to you," she began, in her soft, caressingvoice. "You will understand me, because you know what it is to havewishes, hopes and aspirations that are never realized. You know what itis to be unworldly and unlike others."I was but a girl when I was married, Basil--an innocent, unsuspectinggirl, just seventeen. I might plead, in excuse of what followed, that Iwas married without my own inclination being consulted--unwillinglysacrificed to money that never has done me any good, and never will. Imight plead my youth, my unhappiness, the utter want of congenialitywith the man I married; but I will not. You shall judge me withoutexcuses. I must, however, tell you that at first, for the first twoyears of my married life, I was in despair. There seemed to me no hope,no respite--nothing but despair. Now I have grown accustomed to mymisery, and can wear it with a smile; then it was otherwise. At thattime I was first introduced to Count Jules Ste. Croix. I hate myself,"she continued, passionately, "when I remember how that man duped me. Idid not think him handsome, although other ladies raved of his beauxyeux and his classical face."But I liked him, Basil, because he had the art of expressing silentsympathy for me. He said nothing--if he had done so, my pride would havetaken fire and I should have been saved--but all that other men say inpassionate words, he conveyed to me in passionate looks. He was verykind to me; he used to visit us a great deal, and on several occasionshe stood between me and Lord Lisle's fierce anger."He knew all my distress, my troubles, my misery, as well as I know themmyself. Let me tell you briefly, Basil, that at this unhappy time Iwrote to him three letters--only three. I was so miserable, so wretched,that, unless I had opened my heart to some one, I must have died. Nowlisten, Basil, and do not wonder if I have ceased to believe in men. Heanswered them, and then, after a time, presumed upon my having writtento him. Oh, Basil, if I could but spare myself the shame of telling you!He made a compact of friendship with me that nothing was ever to break.I was but a frightened child, and I made it. He asked me to lend himmoney. Oh, Basil, I was but a frightened, terrified girl, and I lent it!Then he tried to make love to me--he flattered me; he followed me likemy shadow. But there I was firm; he could not frighten me into anythingI thought wrong.""Why, the man is a villain!" cried Basil; "an unprincipled, cowardlyvillain!""Wait," she said, laying her hand on his arm. "Wait; you have not heardall. He uses the three letters as a means of extorting money from me.Now he threatens that if I do not lend it to him, he will show them tomy husband."Basil sprang from his seat, with a hot flush on his handsome young face."I will shoot him!" he said. "Such a man is not fit to breathe the airof heaven.""Hush!" she said again. "You cannot help me unless you are calm. Myhusband does not love me, Basil. The least whisper of this, and,innocent as I am, I should be separated from him and disgraced. It isfrom this I want you to save me. If I were married to a noble, generousman, I should go to him at once, and tell him the truth. If Lord Lisleknew it, he would use it as a pretext for separating himself from me.Basil, you are my knight--you must save me; you must get those letters.""I will," he replied, "at any cost.""I tremble to think how much money, I, in my cowardly fear, have lenthim. He will want more and more, until he has drained a fortune, and Ishall be no safer in the end. I will lend him no more money, Basil; butyou, my only friend, shall get the letters.""I will. How shall I do it! Oh, Lady Lisle, let me fight him--let mepunish him as he deserves!""No," she said; "he is too cunning. If you were to offer to fight withhim, he would know it was for my sake, and he would so place the lettersas to fall into my husband's hands if anything happened to him."But the hot flush did not fade from Basil's face."I must thrash him," he cried."No; for my sake, and because you would do me true service, you mustnot," she said."I will give him all my fortune for the letters," he said."That would not do--he would take your money first, then, holding theletters, would still want more. I will tell you the only plan by whichyou can help me. Go boldly into the room and bring the letters away.""But that looks so much like stealing them," he said. "Let me fight himand take them because I win.""No," she said, sadly. "If you will not help me, as I wish, I mustforego all aid, and suffer on.""You have but to command," he cried, "and I will obey.""This is the count's address," she said. "Go into his rooms; you willfind there an ivory casket; he keeps the letters there; he told me so.""I will do it," he said, quietly.A beautiful light came into her eyes."I knew you would save me, Basil," she said, tenderly. "When will you doit?""I will make my first essay tonight. I shall not rest again until it isdone.""Go to his rooms," she said; "ask for him; if they tell you he is notin, say you will wait for him; then, while you are in the room, open thecasket, take out the letters, destroy them at once, and send word to mewhen it is done. Do not stop to think whether I am right, whether it isthe better plan, but do it at once, because I have said so.""I will do it," he replied. Then she saw a shadow fall over his face."There is nothing really in them, I suppose, Lady Lisle?""Nothing," she said, "but the cry of a woman's breaking heart! Enough toruin me, should my husband ever come to know it.""That he never shall; they shall be destroyed. If I die for it, theyshall be destroyed.""Ah, me," she said; "had ever liege lady so true a knight? Basil, howshall I thank you?""The pleasure of serving you will be thanks enough," he replied."Ah, generous knight, noble knight, who shall say true chivalry isdead?" And she praised him, she flattered him, she thanked him until theslight doubt that had occurred to him died away and he was ashamed ofit.He thought of nothing but obeying her. It was sadly against his highEnglish spirit to steal into a man's room and take from it; he wouldhave preferred fighting until one or the other lay dead. But she hadsaid nay, and it could not be. That very evening he called and was toldthe count was not in; the day following he repeated the call, and theservant, as he had said at the trial, was suspicious, not recognizinghim as one of his master's friends.He called another evening, and, owing to the fact of there being a newservant, he was admitted into the count's room. It was empty, althoughthe gas was burning. He saw the little ivory casket, and with one strokeof his strong, young hand, opened it.There lay the letters, underneath a watch and ring. He obeyed her; hedid not lose one instant. He emptied the casket, carried the letters tothe lighted gas, and burned them! Just as he had raised the watch andring in his hand to replace them, the door opened and the count, withhis servant, entered the room.CHAPTER XIV.The Trap Closed.The count did not utter one word. He saw at one glance what had beendone. He recognized the young gentleman whom he had sneered at as LadyAmelie's victim. He understood at once what had been done."She had asked him to destroy the letters, and he has done it," he saidto himself. In one moment he had formed his scheme of revenge. He wouldgive the young man in charge for stealing his watch and ring. If hecleared himself at all, he must tell the truth. He must tell that he hadnot come there to steal a watch, but to destroy Lady Lisle's letters."If he confesses that," said the quick-witted count to himself, "shewill be doubly disgraced; if he declines to confess, I am at leastrevenged upon him." So, until the entrance of the policeman, the two menstood and glared at each other."You can save yourself," said the count, "if you will confess what youcame for, and if you will write that confession down."Basil smiled contemptuously. "Of what do you charge me?" he said."I shall charge you with stealing my watch and ring," was the reply."Knowing I am innocent?""The alternative lies before you. Confess, as I have said, and LadyAmelie suffers; deny, and you go to prison for stealing."It seemed to him far easier. "I will go to prison," he thought, "I cangive a false name; no one will know me. There will be no fuss, no stir,nothing known, and she, my queen, will be saved."Of course there was no common sense in such a proceeding, nothing butenthusiasm and romance. He certainly had not calculated upon the factbeing known. He had really believed the false name would shield him. Hefound means through a heavy bribe to send one word to Lady Amelie; itwas merely the word, "Destroyed.--B.C." But it gave the queen ofcoquettes a sense of security she had not enjoyed for long. While Basilstill lay in prison, Count Jules sought her."You have baffled me, my lady," he said."Yes," was the calm reply, "I have checkmated you, count. You willextort no more money from me, nor will you threaten me again.""Well," said the count, "I confess myself beaten, and I am not a goodman, either, my Lady Amelie, but sooner than have blighted that youngman's life, as you have done, I would have suffered anything.""My dear count," said Lady Amelie, philosophically, "some men seem, byfate and by nature, destined to be used as a cat's-paw."Count Jules was baffled; his only hold upon the rich and beautiful LadyAmelie was broken. What those letters contained was known only to thelady and himself. If simply the written expressions of her ownunhappiness, he placed more value on them than they were worth. Thechances are that they held more than that.He was entirely defeated--they had been his last resources for long. Hehad never failed, by means of them, to extort money from Lady Lisle atpleasure. It was useless to threaten any more. She had but to dare himto bring forth his proofs, and he had not one word to say.His only consolation was, that in revenge, he had completely blightedthe young hero's life, for hero he was, although his heroism was of amistaken kind.And Lady Amelie--did she feel any regret for the young life tarnished?She missed a very pleasant companion, an enthusiastic adorer, but asfortune would have it, there came to England a young Roman prince, whowas both artist and poet, handsome as a Greek god, and wealthy beyondcompare. His appearance created a perfect furore in fashionable society,and he, as a matter of course, fell in love with Lady Amelie, so thatshe soon forgot the young knight who languished in prison. When theseason was over, she persuaded her husband to go to Rome, and never lefteven a line or a message for the mistaken young man who had done so muchfor her.She only did what suited her; she was the queen of coquettes, and shemade him useful to her; nothing else mattered.The lonely months wore on very slowly for Basil. At first the notion ofheroism and the conviction that he was performing a most noble andchivalrous deed sustained him; but there was a fund of common sense inhis character, and this common sense suggested to him that instead ofbeing a hero, he had been the dupe of a wily coquette. Not at first didthis idea strike him; not until long, dreary weeks had passed, and shehad never sent him even one message of thanks or sympathy. He was veryangry with the idea at first, thinking it quite a false one, butgradually he awakened to the conviction that it was true.Then his fortitude forsook him, and it was some consolation to hear fromMr. Forster that what the kind-hearted lawyer called hismisrepresentations had been effectual. People had almost forgotten thatlittle paragraph that had one morning taken London by storm."I have denied it so constantly and emphatically," he said, "that mywords have been believed. As soon as you get out of here, make hasteabroad, then all may be well."Even he could not help seeing how entirely the light and brightness hadfaded from the young face."I have never said anything to you," said Mr. Forster, one morning, "butI have a certain conviction, Mr, Carruthers, that there is some woman inthis; you are here for a woman's sake and to screen her from blame; ifso, it is useless asking you to tell the truth, I know, but make thebest of it; get out of this as soon as you can."He did so. When the six months were over, "John Smith" was dischargedand did not linger many hours in London; he went at once to Paris, andthere made out where Lady Amelie was."In Rome," replied the gentleman of whom he asked the question. "Herlast caprice was a young Roman prince, and they are settled there forthe winter." To Rome he resolved to go. He would see for himself whethershe was all that his dreaming fancy had painted her, or whether she waswhat men said--a heartless coquette.He went to Rome, and found her, as usual, queen of all that was mostbrilliant and gay.It was at a soiree given by the Duchessa Sforza. He saw her again,beautiful, radiant and magnificent. By her side stood a young man, whowas handsome as one of the grand old statutes that ornamented thegalleries of Rome. He watched her, thinking bitterly of the time thathad passed since be looked his last on that radiant face, and all thebitter shame that had been his portion since then.He crossed the room and went over to her. Whatever dismay she may havefelt, she showed none. She looked up with a bright, cold smile, asthough they had parted but yesterday."Mr. Carruthers!" she said. "I hope you are well. I really believe thathalf of England is coming to Rome.""Can you wonder," said the prince, "when England's fairest queen ishere?"Lady Amelie introduced the two gentlemen, and after a time the princewent away. Then she turned her lovely face to the young man she hadduped so cleverly."How do you like Rome?" she asked,"I cannot talk commonplace to you, Lady Lisle," he said; "I have comefrom England purposely to see you,"She looked slightly impatient."Ah," she replied. "Of course I am very much obliged to you; but youmust have been terribly imprudent. Could you not have managed withoutbeing discovered in that suspicious attitude? I was so grievouslydistressed. You are too quixotic--you seek needless dangers."That was the extent of her gratitude to the man who had saved herreputation, character, and fair fame."I did not compromise you," he said. "I preferred imprisonment to that.""Yes; but it was quixotic; there was no need for anything of the kind.""I am very sorry to have erred from excess of zeal," he replied,sarcastically. "It is a comfort to me to think that I shall not sooffend again.""I hope," she said, more anxiously, "that it will not injure you--thatno one will know about it. It was really too shocking. Prison for ayoung man of your position! It was absurd.""I thought so myself, before I came out; it was absurd; but you will becomforted to know, Lady Amelie, that no one seems to have known of itbut my mother, Lady Carruthers, and my lawyer, Mr. Forster. So far asthe world is concerned, I am safe."The prince returned, looking slightly jealous, and then Basil amusedhimself, after a bitter fashion. He watched Lady Amelie playing off allher airs, graces, and fascinations on the young prince, as she hadplayed them upon him. He was cured. It was a bitter lesson, but itlasted him. He began to understand the difference between romance andreality--between dreaming and doing. It had been a hard, bitter, almostshameful, lesson, but he was thankful in after years that he had learnedit.He found, after a time, that the world was wiser than he thought."There is some story about Mr. Carruthers," people would say, but no oneever knew exactly what it was. He remained in Rome for a whole week.Before it was over he was quite cured of his liking for the queen ofcoquettes.CHAPTER XV.The Denouement.Then Basil Carruthers set himself busily to work to discover how hemight best undo the effects of his folly. The duties he had thought solightly of rose before him now."I will go down to Ulverston," he said to himself, "and with God's helpI will be a wiser and a better man."He saw what his mistaken notions of chivalry had done for him--howcompletely they had misled him--how near they had brought him to ruinand disgrace. The meeting between mother and son was not the mostpleasant in the world. Lady Carruthers, stately, sensitive, and proud,could not forgive the dark disgrace under which her son had lain. He sawhow deeply she felt it."Mother," he said, "you must judge me leniently. I own myself mistaken.I think, sometimes, I must have been mad, I cannot tell you preciselywhat took me to prison. Will you believe me that it was for a woman'ssake?""I knew it!" she interrupted."It was to screen a woman's folly," he continued. "And, indeed, wrong asI was, I believed myself to be doing a most chivalrous deed.""It is a great pity, Basil," said Lady Carruthers."Yes," he said, quietly; "but I was a woman's dupe, and I have sufferedenough. It was one false step, but I shall spend my life in trying toredeem it."He kept his word. In four years' time the name of Basil Carruthers rangthrough the land with a pleasant sound; he had, indeed, found somethingto do.He was returned for the borough of Rutsford, and his fame as an able andeloquent orator spread over the country.Then he studied to become a model landlord; he built large, airycottages and schools; he paid the attention that every landlord ought topay that the land be well drained, well cultivated. He was a friend toall his tenants, a benefactor to his dependants. In the course of timepeople forgot to whisper there had been some story about Mr. Carruthers;they only mentioned him in terms of praise. The very quality that hismother once thought would be against him now proved to be in his favor.If he was more romantic, more enthusiastic than other young men, heemployed the superabundance of his gifts to excellent purpose.After some years there was a grand wedding at Ulverston. BasilCarruthers won Marion Hautville for his wife. Before they were marriedhe took her one afternoon for a long ramble in the green summer woodsand told her this story. Marion was shocked at first; it seemed to herimpossible that a man could be so foolish as to mistake a deed like thatfor chivalry."And what has become of your lovely Lady Amelie now?" she asked."She is still the queen of coquettes," replied Basil; "but, Marion,although it was a terrible mistake, and I suffered so bitterly for it, Icannot be altogether sorry that it happened. I should have been auseless dreamer until the day of my death if this had not taken place.It was a rude, rough, but sure awakening.""I shall never call you my knight," said Marion. "Why, Basil, dear, aschoolboy would not have been taken in by such nonsense.""But, Marion, I was not so wise as a schoolboy," he replied."She only used you for her own purposes. She simply made a cat's-paw ofyou, Basil.""I can see it now, darling, I did not then. But you will forgive me,Marion?""Yes; because, after all, though you were so greatly mistaken, still thefaults that led to your mistake were almost virtues."Lady Carruthers was rendered very happy by her son's marriage. When Mrs.Carruthers went to London, she proved to be Lady Amelie's greatestrival. She was quite as beautiful, as witty, as clever, but in place ofcoquetry, she was gifted with honest simplicity, that men pronouncedcharming, while Lady Amelie, to her great chagrin, began to find herattractions on the wane. Men grew tired of her vanity and her cruelty.Women disliked her for her selfish disregard of everything but her owntriumph.Basil Carruthers bows his head in shame and contrition when he remembersthis episode in his career. Then Marion, his wife, kisses him with asmile, and tells him he is not much the worse for having been once upona time a coquette's victim.THE END.[Illustration]GOLD MONOGRAM DINNER SET FREEYOUR OWN INITIAL--DISTINCTIVE--INDIVIDUAL--ELEGANTBIG 42-PIECE SETThese dishes are not the kind you see every day, but the exquisite,ultra-fashionable kind; the pure white, lovely decorated and dainty setsuch as we offer you herewith.

My idea isthat the cheap cab-fare should include any place in the Home Counties.Cabmen should also be prevented by law from refusing to take a person,say, from Piccadilly to St. Albans, on the plea that their horse"could not do the distance." All assertions of that kind should bepunished as perjury. Cabmen are notoriously untruthful. Why shouldnot Cab Proprietors, too, be obliged to keep relays of horses atconvenient spots on all the main roads out of Town in case a horsereally proves unequal to going fifteen miles or so into the country,in addition to a hard day's work in London?--Yours unselfishly,_St. Albans_. NORTHWARD HO!SIR,--Why _will_ people libel the Suburbs, and keep on describingthem as dull? I am sure that a place which, like the one I writefrom, contains a Lawn Tennis Club (entrance into which we keep _very_select), a Circulating Library, where all the new books of twoyears' back are obtainable without much delay, a couple of handsomeand ascetic young Curates, and a public Park, capable of holdingtwenty-six perambulators and as many nursemaids at one and the sametime, can only fitly be described as an Elysium. Still, we _should_ begrateful for better facilities for getting away from its delights nowand then, and this proposal to extend the Cab Radius has the warmestsupport of Yours,EASILY SATISFIED.SIR,--By all means let us have cheaper Cabs in Greater London! TheCounty Council should subsidise a lot of Cabs, to ply exclusivelybetween London and the outskirts. Or why not a Government Cab PurchaseBill, like the Irish Land Purchase one? We want a special Minister forPublic Locomotion--perhaps Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL would accept thepost?Yours, spiritedly, HAMPSTEAD HEATHEN.       *       *       *       *       *"HARD TO BEER!"(_ADVANCE-SHEET FROM A PROJECTED ANTI-BACCHANALIAN TRAGI-FARCE, TO BECALLED "BY ORDER OF THE KAISER."_)    SCENE--_A Market Place in Berlin._ German Students    _carousing._ Emissary of the Emperor _seated at table apart    watching them.

Miss PRENDERGAST has brought "The Stones of Venice" for the    benefit of her brother and PODBURY.

He did so on the ground that he hadalways understood that _Henry the Eighth_ was by SHAKSPEARE, and foundit credibly asserted that that gentleman had no part in the authorshipof the piece. Mr. BRAM STOKER, M.A., was called to the assistanceof the box-keeper, and ably discussed the point. Whilst declining tocommit himself to the admission that SHAKSPEARE had no hand in thework, he quoted authority which assigned the authorship to FLETCHERand MASSENGER; in which case, he ingeniously argued, the authorshipbeing dual, the price of the Stalls ought to be doubled.

Personally, I prefer Mr.IRVING's picture of WOLSEY to the extant portraits, which concur inrepresenting him as a heavy, jowly-faced man, who might be taken asa model for one of GUSTAVE DORE'S eccentric-looking ecclesiastics inthe _Contes Drolatiques_, rather than as the living presentment of thegreat Chancellor, Statesman, and Churchman who ruled a cruel, crafty,sensual tyrant, and successfully guided the policy of England at homeand abroad. HENRY IRVING's _Cardinal_ is a grand figure, courtly,though somewhat too cringing withal, evidently despising the variousmeans he uses to further the end he has in view, and looking upon theLords, Courtiers and all around him as merely puppets, whose stringshe holds to work them as he will.[Illustration: The Cardinal's _Train de Luxe_.]Then, after seeing him as Sole Adviser of the Crown, after seeing himas Highest Judge in the Ecclesiastical Divorce Court in such splendidstate as our Judge JEUNE may eye with envy, after seeing him in hisown Palace, most courteous as Grand Master and liberal Provider ofRight Royal Revels, he is exhibited to us in the deserted Hall, aspectacle for gods and men (that is, shown to the Gallery and the restof the audience), the single figure of the Great Cardinal, fallen fromhis high estate; and to him, in place of all his princely retinue,comes his one faithful servant, CROMWELL, supporting his dying master,for dying he is, as he staggers feebly from the Palace at Bridewell.It is difficult to call to mind any situation in any play moregenuinely affecting in its simplicity than this. The audience isheld spell-bound,--yet, for my part, I should have welcomed a greatervariety in tone and action.[Illustration: Ellen Terry as Kate.]Miss ELLEN TERRY's _Queen Katharine_ is a "very woman." You can seehow she has caught the King, and how she still holds him. She loveshim, actually loves him, to the last to respect him is impossible, butshe respects herself; and it is just this love for him, for what hewas, not what he is, and her respect for herself, which Miss ELLENTERRY marks so forcibly. _Katharine_ is a foreigner, therefore isher bearing, though stately, less stolid than that of the typicalEnglish Tragedy Queen. The note of her dying scene, so striking byits simplicity, is its perfect tranquillity. Who's _Griffith_? Whythe veteran HOWE (ah, Howe, When and Where did I first see you,Sir? Wasn't it in the days when good old Mortonian farces were theattraction at the Haymarket?) is "_the_ safe man," and excellentlywell did he deliver his epitaph on _Wolsey_. But all are good, notforgetting our old friend the sterling, that is the ARTHUR STIRLINGactor as _Cranmer_, and the youthful GILLIE FARQUHAR, unrecognisableas _Lord Sands_, looking as ancient as if he were The Sands of Time.This revival is bound to have a long--it may be an unprecedentedlylong--run. All of us dearly love a show.

There was a heart,a tender one, a pen of gold, a set of Golf-clubs, a bat, wickets, anda ball, oars and a boat, boxing gloves, foils, guns, rifles, books,everything, except ready money, that heart could desire. Unluckilyone Fairy, who was old, deaf, plain, and who had not been invited,observed, "It is all very well, my child, but not one of thesearticles shall you be able to use satisfactorily." This awful cursehas hung heavy on my doom. With a restless desire to shine and excel,at Lord's, on the river, on the Moors, in the forests, in Society,on the Links, bitter personal experience and the remarks of candidfriends, tell me that the doom has come upon me. I am "an all-roundDuffer," as my youngest nephew, _aetat._ XI., freely informed me, whenI served twice out of court (once into the conservatory, the othertime through the study window). I was a Duffer at marbles, alsoat tops, and my personal efforts in these kinds were constantly inliquidation. But what are marbles and tops! The first regular game Iwas entered at was Golf. Five is not too early to begin, and I beganat five by being knocked down with a club which another small boy wasbrandishing. This naturally gave me an extreme zeal for the sportof MARY STUART, the Great Marquis of MONTROSE, CHARLES EDWARD (whointroduced Golf into Italy), DUNCAN FORBES of Culloden, Mr. HORACEHUTCHINSON, and other eminent historical characters.[Illustration]Almost everybody now knows that Golf is not Hockey. Nobody _runs_after the ball except young ladies at W--m--n! The object is to puta very small ball into a very tiny and remotely distant hole, withengines singularly ill adapted for the purpose. There are manyengines. First there is the Driver, a long club, wherewith the ballis supposed to be propelled from the tee, a little patch of sand.The Tee and the Caddie have nothing to do with each other; nobodybut a flippant Cockney sees any fun in plays upon words which, inthemselves, are only too serious. Then there is a weapon called aBrassey. It is like unto a club, but is shod with brass, and is usedfor hitting a ball in "a bad lie" among long grass or heather. A smalltomahawk, styled a Cleek, is employed when you don't know what else toplay with. The same remark applies to an Iron, which is very good formissing the ball with, also for hitting to square leg when you meantto go straight. A "Mashy" is a smaller "iron." The skilful use thesewhen the ball lies in sand, in gorse, or when they wish to make theball soar for a short distance and then fall dead. A Putter is a shortthickish club used for jogging the ball into the hole with. There areplenty of other kinds of clubs, also spoons, but _these_ are enough tobreak the heart of any Duffer.I am an old player, of forty years' standing, but, like _Parolles_ Iwas "made for every man to breathe himself on." When my form is espiednear the links, the players shirk off as if I were a leper. They areafraid I may want to make a match with them, and there is no falsehoodfrom which they will shrink, in their desire to escape me. EvenLadies,--but this is a delicate theme. Beginners breathe themselves onme, and give me odds after two or three engagements.Yet I don't know why I am so bad. True, I am short-sighted, never seethe flag at the hole, play in the wrong direction, and talk a gooddeal on topics of academic interest during the round. The Golfer'smind should be a blank, and generally is "blank enough," like _SirTor's_ shield. My mind is, perhaps, too active--that may be whatis the matter with me. It is the same thing at whist--but of thishereafter. My Caddie, or arm-bearer, has his own views about thecauses of my incompetence."Ye're no standing richt. Ye haud yer hands wrang. Ye tak' yer ee offthe ba'. Ye're ower quick up. Ye're ower slow doun. Ye dinna swing.Ye fa' back. Ye haud ower ticht wi' yer richt hand. Ye dinna let yourarms gang easy. Ye whiles tap, and whiles slice, and whiles heel, orye hit her aff the tae. Ye're hooking her. Ye're no thinking o' whatye're doing. Ye'll never be a Gowfer. Lord! ony man can lairn Greek,but Gowf needs a heid."Here are fifteen ways of going wrong, and there is only one way ofgoing right! Fifteen things to think of, every time you take a driverin hand. And, remember, that is not nearly all. These fifteen fatalerrors apply to long driving. You may (or at least _I_ may, and do)make plenty of other blunders with the other weapons. Say the balllies in sand--"a bunker," technically. If you hit it whack on the top,it disappears in a foot-mark. If you "tak' plenty o' sand," why, you_get_ plenty of sand in your mouth, your eyes, down the back of yourneck, and the ball is no forwarder. If you strike her quite clean,she goes like a bullet against the face of the bunker, soars in theair, falls on your head, and you lose the hole! Oh, Golf is full ofbitterness!Suppose we play a round. The ball is neatly "tee'd" on a patch ofsand. I approach, I shuffle with my feet for a secure footing, Iwaggle my club in an airy manner. Then I take it up and whack it down.A variety of things _may_ occur. I may smite the top of the hall, whenit runs on for twenty yards and lies in a rut on the road. I may hither on the heel of the club, when she spins, with much "cut" on, intothe sea. I may hit her with the toe of the club, when she soars tosquare leg, and perhaps breaks a window. I used to try running in atthe ball, as if it were a half-volley at Cricket, but that way liesmadness. However, suppose that, in a lucid interval (as will happen),I hit her clean. She soars away, and falls within forty yards of ameandering burn. The hole, the haven where one would be, is beyond theburn.I seize a cleek or an iron, it turns in my hand, cuts up the turf, andthe ball rolls half a dozen feet. My opponent has crossed the burn.I try again; a fearful misdirected shot; the ball soars over theburn and lands in a road behind the hole. There is no hitting out ofthis road, or, if one does hit a desperate blow, the ball lands inan eccentric sand-hole, called the Scholar's Bunker. We start forthe next hole. _Meme jeu!_ Now we are in the gorse, now among theStation Master's potatoes, now in the railway, where all hope may beabandoned, now in bunkers many, now missing the ball altogether, whenyou feel as if your arms had flown off. As for "putting" the shortstrokes on the green, near the hole, if I hit sharp, the ball runsover the hole yards and yards beyond, or if I hit mild, it stops withan air of plaintive resignation, after dribbling for a foot or two.And the worst of it is that, sometimes, you will play as well asanother for half-a-dozen holes. Then one thinks one has The Secret!But it falls from us, vanishes, we are topping and slicing, andheeling, and missing again as sorrily as ever.The beauty of Golf is that there are so many ways of going wrong, andso many things to think of. A person of very moderately active mindhas his ideas diverted by the landscape, the sea, the blossom on thegorse, the larks singing overhead, not to mention the whole systemof the universe. He forgets to keep his eye on the ball, in devotinghis energy to holding tight with his left, and being slow up. Orhe remembers to keep his eye on the ball, and forgets the otheressentials. Then an awful moment comes when he loses his temper.Thereby all is lost, honour (not to mention "the honour,") andeverything. People in front, old people, are so provoking. They pottertardily along, pass ten minutes in considering a putt, shout and swearif you hit into them, and are not pleased if you sit down and smokewhile you wait. The only entity that I don't lose my temper with is mypartner. The worse he plays, the better am I pleased to have a brotherin adversity. The subjective Golfer, however, is certainly a bore. Heis "put off" by every simple circumstance, by his opponent wearing anunbecoming cap and the like. Afterwards, he will hold forth for hourson all his sorrows and all the sins of others. The Duffer is moremodest and less apologetic. He is kept always playing (as I said)by the diabolical circumstance that he has lucid intervals, thoughrarely, when he plays like other people for three or four holes.I once, myself did the long hole in--but never mind. Nobody wouldbelieve me. The most amiable of Duffers was he who, after ten strokesin a bunker, cut his ball into three parts. "I am bringing it out," hesaid, "in penny numbers."The born Duffer, I speak feelingly, is incurable. No amount of oddswill put him on the level even of Scotch Professors. For the learnedhave divided Golf into several categories. There is ProfessionalGolf, the best Amateur Golf, Enthusiasts' Golf, Golf, Beginners'Golf, Ladies' Golf, Infant Golf, Parlour Golf, the Golf of ScotchProfessors. But the true Duffer's Golf is far, far below that. ADuffer like me is too bad for hanging. He should be condemned to playfor life at Chorley Wood, or to bush-whack at Bungay.       *       *       *       *       *FREE AND EASY THEATRES.--We have no sympathy whatever with the idea ofa Theatre Libre or with a Free-and-Easy Theatre, but we shall be veryglad when all Theatres are made Easy, Easy, that is, as to sittingaccommodation, and Easy of egress and ingress.

LILLY. In a recent trial it came out that Mr. GEORGE MEREDITHis the accredited and professional reader for Messrs. CHAPMAN ANDHALL. Is it possible that this eminent philosophical Novelist isindebted to a quiet perusal of _Shibboleths_ for some of the quaintphilosophical touches not to be read off schoolboywise, with hurriedellipses, blurting lips, and unintelligent brain, if any, which make_One of Our Conquerors_ and others, worth perusal? Be this as it may,which is a convenient shibbolethian formula, the Baron read this book,and enjoyed it muchly. There is an occasional dig into the Huxleiananatomy, given with all the politeness of a Louis-the-Fifteenthian"M.A.," otherwise _Maitre d'Armes_, and a passing reference to "ThePeople's WILLIAM" and the carrying out of the People's will--which isquite another affair,--all, to quote Sir PETER, "vastly entertaining."The chapter on the Shibboleth "Education" is, thinks the Baron, aboutthe best. Mr. LILLY is a Satirist who, as GEORGIUS MEREDITHIUS MAGNUSmight express it, is, in his fervour, near a truth, grasps it, and ismoved to moral distinctness, mental intention, with a preference ofstrong, plain speech, and a chuck of interjectory quotation over thecrack of his whip, with which tramping active he flicks his fellowssharply. With which Meredithism concludesTHE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.       *       *       *       *       *PREUX CHEVALIER.SIR,--The amazing popularity of the Costermonger Songs seems to mea significant phenomenon. While no humane person would deny to theitinerant vendor of comestibles that sympathy which is accordedto the joys and sorrows of his more refined fellow-creatures, itis impossible to view without alarm the hold which his loose andungrammatical diction is obtaining in the most cultured _salons_ ofto-day. Anxious to minimise the danger, yet loth to check a sentimentof fraternity so creditable to our common humanity, I have deviseda plan by which Mr. CHEVALIER's songs may he rendered in such-wisethat while all their deep humanity is preserved, their English is soelevated as to be innocuous to the nicest sensibility. Permit me togive, just as a sample, my treatment of that very popular ballad,known, _rubesco referens_, as "_Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road_."Not being a singer, I have adopted Mr. CLIFFORD HARRISON's charmingplan of speaking through the music of the song, and this is how _I_render the chorus:--"'How is it with you?' was the universal exclamation of the residentsin the vicinity."'With whom, WILLIAM, have you made an appointment?'"'Have you, WILLIAM, purchased all the house-property in thisthoroughfare?'"Were my risible faculties exercised?--you ask me. Nay. Indeed I wasactually apprehensive of a fatal issue."So striking was the effect produced upon those in the ancient Cantianhighway."This, Sir, not only gives the sense, but gives it, I venture to claim,in a form fit for the apprehension of the most refined. Judging,too, by the reception it met with at our recent Penny Readings, Iam convinced that Mr. CHEVALIER's peculiar humour is thoroughlypreserved, for, indeed, many of the audience laughed till I becamepositively concerned for their safety.Yours faithfully, ROBERT BOWDLER SPALDING.       *       *       *       *       *GOOD NEWS INDEED!That fiendish malefactor, the Influenza Bacillus, has been caughtat last!

JOHN HAYS HAMMONDLongmans, Green, and Co.39 Paternoster Row LondonNew York and Bombay1897PREFACETo the American Public, whose sympathy was my chief support throughdays of bitter trial, this book is gratefully dedicated. My personalexperience forms the subject of my story. The causes of the Revolt inJohannesburg, and the ensuing political questions, are but lightlytouched upon, in deference to the silence enforced upon my husband asone of the terms of his liberation by the Boer Government.                    NATALIE HAMMOND.  BOUGHTON: BICKLEY, KENT.      February, 1897.A WOMAN'S PART IN A REVOLUTION    I hope I may be able to tell the truth always, and to see    it aright according to the eyes which God Almighty gives    me.--THACKERAY.I.Totsey the terrier lay blinking in the hot African sun, while CeciliaRhodes, the house kitten, languished in a cigar box wrapped about withtwine to represent bars of iron. Above her meek face was a large labelmarked 'African Lion.' Her captor, my young son Jack, was out againamong the flower-beds in quest of other big game, armed with myriding-crop. The canvas awnings flapped gently in the cool breeze.Every now and then a fan-like arm of one of the large Madeira chairswould catch the impetus and go speeding down the wide red-tiledverandah. I looked up from the little garment which I was making, uponthis quiet picture. It was the last restful moment I was to know formany long months--such months of suffering and agonised apprehensionas God in His mercy sends to few women.David, my husband's black coachman, drove rapidly through the gate,and, coming up to me, handed me a letter. It was from his master andbriefly written. Jameson had crossed the Border; Johannesburg wasfilled with strange people, and he thought it wise for me to move withour family and servants into town. Rooms had been secured for us atHeath's Hotel, and he would meet us that night at dinner. This summonswas not entirely unexpected. For many months the political kettle hadbeen simmering. Johannesburg had grown tired of sending petitions into the Government to be answered by promises which were neverredeemed. An appalling death-rate of fifty-six in each thousand,directly traceable to lack of proper sanitation, resulting from badgovernment, spurred the general discontent, and a number ofrepresentative citizens, unwilling longer to wait upon gods andGovernment, finding all attempts to obtain redress of their grievancesby constitutional means ineffectual, determined to enforce theirdemands for right by arms if necessary. As arms for the Uitlanderunder the law of the Transvaal could only be obtained by a permit,guns and ammunition were smuggled into the country, hidden away in oiltanks and coal cars.My husband had vast interests in his charge; many million poundssterling had been invested at his instance in the mining industry ofthe country, and, actuated by a sense of duty and responsibility tothose who had confided in him, he felt in honour bound to take anactive part in the movement, for the protection and preservation ofthe property placed under his control.My leaving for the Cape, in case affairs should assume a dangerousphase, was frequently discussed between us, but I could not make up mymind to leave my husband, feeling that the separation would be moretrying than if I remained, even should a conflict be forced upon us.In addition to my wish to be with him, I knew that many of his staffhad their wives and children in Johannesburg, and would be unable tosend them away, and for me, the wife of their chief, 'to bundle to therear' would subject my husband, as well as myself, to harsh, and notunjust, criticism.The Leonard Manifesto was published December 26th, setting forth thedemands of the Uitlander.'We want,' it reads:     '1. The establishment of this Republic as a true Republic.     '2. A Grondwet or constitution which shall be framed by     competent persons selected by representatives of the whole     people, and framed on lines laid down by them; a     constitution which shall be safeguarded against hasty     alteration.     '3. An equitable Franchise law and fair representation.     '4. Equality of the Dutch and English languages.     '5. Responsibility to the Legislature of the heads of the     great departments.     '6. Removal of religious disabilities.     '7. Independence of the Courts of Justice, with adequate and     secured remuneration of the judges.     '8. Liberal and comprehensive education.     '9. An efficient Civil Service, with adequate provision for     pay and pension.     '10. Free Trade in South African products.'It was further planned to hold another meeting of the 'NationalUnion,' and afterward make a last demand upon the Government toredress our wrongs.Arrangement meanwhile was made with Dr. Jameson, who was encamped onthe western border of the Republic with a body of the CharteredCompany's troops. In case of a disturbance he was to come to the aidof Johannesburg with at least a thousand men and 1,500 guns. It wasalso distinctly understood between him and the five gentlemen who werethe recognised leaders of the movement, that he should not start untilhe had received instructions to do so directly from them.I gathered my household about me, explained the situation, and gavethe servants their choice, whether they would go into town or remainin the house. The four white servants decided to remain, but thenative boys begged leave to depart under various pretexts. One to gethis missis from Pretoria because he was afraid the Boers might killher. Another to tell his mother in Natal that he was all right.Another frankly said, that as the white men were going to fight amongthemselves, this was no place for Kaffirs.I arranged to leave Mr. Hammond's secretary in charge of the house.We hastily packed up a few of our most precious belongings, and left,to take possession of four tiny rooms at the hotel in town. With afull heart I looked back at my pretty home. The afternoon shadows werebeginning to lengthen; I saw the broad verandah, the long easy chairssuggestive of rest; my books on the sill of the low bedroom window;the quiet flower garden, sweet with old-fashioned posies associatedwith peace and thrift. We were going to--WHAT?IIMy diary carries the story on:--DECEMBER 30.--We find the town intensely excited, but there is nodisorder. Men are hurrying about in cabs and on foot withdetermined-looking faces, but no other visible evidence of the day'stragedy.My husband ran in to see how we were faring about 8 o'clock thisevening. I had not seen him since early morning. He told me that aReform Committee had been formed of the leading men of the city. Alsothat the Americans had called a meeting in the course of the afternoonto hear the results of a Special Deputation, consisting of Messrs.Hennen Jennings and Perkins, to President Kruger. Mr. Jenningsreported the President as having listened to them attentively whilethey conveyed to him what they believed to be the sentiment of theAmericans on the Rand. They assured him that, although the Americansrecognised the rights of the Boers as well as those of the Uitlanders,unless he could in some way meet the demand of the unenfranchisedpeople of the Transvaal he could not expect their support when therevolution came. They also told him that the Americans wanted to seethe Republic preserved, but on a truer basis. And when questioned bythe President if in case of rebellion the Americans would be with oragainst the Government, they answered bluntly, 'They would be againstthe Government.'President Kruger dogmatically declared 'this was no time fordiscussion, but a time for the people to obey the law,' and with thisthey were dismissed.A Committee of three is appointed to visit Pretoria to-morrow andagain lay before the President a statement of the demands of theUitlanders, the attitude of the Americans and their wish to preservethe integrity of the Republic, but also to warn him that, if theGovernment insists upon ignoring these just demands, and thusprecipitates war, the Americans must array themselves on the side ofthe other Uitlanders.A large mass meeting is called to receive these gentlemen on theirreturn from Pretoria and to decide upon the Americans' future courseof action.The mail train to Cape Town was crowded with hundreds ofterror-stricken women and children sent away by anxious husbands to aplace of safety. The ordinary accommodation was far too inadequate tosupply the sudden rush. They were crowded like sheep on cattle trucks.I fear the journey of a thousand miles will be one of greatdiscomfort.[1]There are many anxious souls in Johannesburg to-night.Betty and I are sitting up. The night is sultry, and we have draggedour chairs out on to the verandah which overhangs the street.MIDNIGHT.--The town has quieted down. Once a wild horseman clattereddown the street towards the 'Gold Fields' shouting, 'A despatch, men!a despatch. We've licked the Dutchmen!' A few heads peered out ofwindows--but that was all.DECEMBER 31.--My husband came in at 4 o'clock this morning, lookingvery tired. He was on the point of going to bed, when a messenger camefrom the 'Gold Fields' and hurried him away.The streets are alive at a very early hour, and the excitementincreases. The Reform Committee sits in perpetual session in theoffices of the 'Gold Fields.' They are appointing sub-committees forthe safeguard and comfort of the town; 51,000_l._ for the relief ofthe poor has already been raised. Messengers are sent out to call inall the women and children from the mines. Arrangements are being madefor the housing and feeding of these. Nothing is forgotten, andeverything goes on with the utmost method and precision. It is like agreat, splendid piece of machinery.The merchants have sent up a deputation to try to bring the Presidentto reason. He has temporarily removed the dues from food stuffs as aresult of the interview. The Government has prohibited all telegraphiccommunication. _We are cut off from the world_.The Reform Committee repudiates Dr. Jameson's inroad, but publishesits intention to adhere to the National Union Manifesto, and'earnestly desires that the inhabitants should refrain from taking anyaction which can be construed as an overt act of hostility against theGovernment.' A certain tone of security and dignity pervades all thenotices of the Reform Committee. The town is sure of success.In order to silence rumours in regard to the hoisting of the Englishflag, Mr. Hammond after some difficulty secured a flag of theTransvaal, and took it into the committee room this morning. Theentire body of men swore allegiance with uncovered heads and upraisedhands. The flag now floats from the roof of the 'Gold Fields.' Themerchants have closed their shops and battened up the windows withthick boards and plates of corrugated iron. Boer police are withdrawnfrom the town. Excitement at fever heat, but everything runningsmoothly. No drunkenness nor rioting. The streets are filled withearnest-looking men. Near the Court House arms are being distributed.At another point horses are given over to the newly-enrolledvolunteers.4 P.M.--I have driven from one end of the town to the other, throughbusy crowded streets, without seeing one disorderly person, or beingregarded a second time by one of the thousands of men filing solemnlypast my carriage. They would form into squads and march gravely totheir posts of duty. A splendid-looking set of men, ranging in agefrom 25 to 35. Men from every walk in life, professional men, robustminers, and pale clerks, some among the faces being very familiar. Myeyes filled when I thought of what the future might be bringing them.At the hotel dinner Mrs. Dodd, Betty and I were the only womenpresent. The room was crowded with men who spoke excitedly of apossible war and exchanged specimen cartridges across the table. Ihear that one thousand Lee-Metford rifles have been given out. Thetown is now policed by Uitlanders under Trimble.The Americans have held another meeting. Five hundred men werepresent, and with only five dissenting votes determined to stand bythe Manifesto. After this meeting, the George Washington Corps of 150members was formed.Following are the names of the various Brigades:--Australian, Scotch, Africander, Cycle, Colonial, Natal, Irish,Northumbrian, Cornish, and Bettington's Horse and the Ambulance Corps.Most of the mines are closing down. Women and children are stillflying from the town. Alas! some men, too, who are heartily jeered bythe crowd at the railroad station.[2]St. John's Ambulance Society is advertising for qualified nurses orladies willing to assist.Natives are in a state of great panic. One of the Kaffir servants inthe hotel gave me a tremendous shock this morning by rushing into myroom to fling himself at my feet, sobbing and imploring me not toallow the Boers to kill him.LATER.--The sultry day has cooled down into a calm, moonlit night.This evening the Reform Committee received a deputation from theGovernment consisting of Messrs. Marais and Malan; these gentlemenshowed their authority from the Government, and were duly accredited.They are both progressive Boers and highly respected by theUitlanders. They stated that they had come with the olive branch, thatthe Government had sent them to the Reform Committee to invite adelegation of that Committee to meet in Pretoria a Commission ofGovernment officials, with the object of arranging an amicablesettlement of the political questions. They emphatically asserted thatthe Government would meet the Reform Committee half-way--that theGovernment was anxious to prevent bloodshed, &c. That they couldpromise that the Government would redress the Uitlander grievancesupon the lines laid down in the Manifesto, but that of course all thedemands would not be conceded at once, and both sides must be willingto compromise. The Reform Committee met to consider this proposal,and after long discussion decided to send a deputation to Pretoria.These gentlemen leave with Messrs. Malan and Marais on a special trainto-night for Pretoria.Johannesburg is quiet as ever was country town. The streets deserted.Nothing to suggest a city girt around by a cordon of soldiers, and yetsuch it is.At midnight my husband ran in for a moment to see how we had stood thestrain of the day.'Is the news from Jameson really true?' I asked, still hoping it wasrumour.'I am afraid so.''And are those heavy wagons just going down the street carrying thebig guns to the outskirts?''Yes. Good-night, dear.' He was gone.FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 1: The sufferings of this hapless crowd were acute.Provisions were hard to obtain at the way stations. The water supplygave out. A little child died of exposure, and the heart-broken motherheld the lifeless body twenty-four hours on her lap. There was no roomto lay it to one side. Another woman gave birth to an infant.][Footnote 2: The Cornish miners were politely presented at Kimberleyand other places en route with bunches of white feathers by thehowling mob. One Cornishman afterwards related that he was pulled outat every station and made to fight. After the fourth mauling he turnedround and went back to Johannesburg, preferring to take his chanceswith the Boers.]IIIJanuary 1, 1896.--With the dawn of day I am out of bed and at thewindow waiting for the cry of the newsboy.What will the New Year bring us?With nervous dread I opened the paper brought to my door. In largeheadlines it told of disaster.The Natal train filled with refugee women and children has beenwrecked, with great loss of life. The papers say forty have beenkilled outright, and many fearfully injured. Entire families have beenwiped out in some cases. Mr. ---- has lost his wife, his sister, andthree little children. This is the result of a Boer concession. Theaccident was caused by the Netherlands carriages being poorly builtand top-heavy. In rounding a curve they were swung off thetrack--collapsed at once like card-houses, crushing and mangling thehelpless and crowded occupants.The deputation to Pretoria did not leave last night, as was expected.They go this morning instead.My husband is greatly disturbed at the delay. He says time is allimportant, and the Reform Committee's hands should not be tied whilethe Boers gain time.Reports of Jameson's meeting the enemy have been amplified. Now it issaid that fifty of his men have been killed and three hundred Boers.Sir John Willoughby is believed to be shot.I drove out to my home to reassure my women, Mr. Sharwood havingbrought in word that the coachman Adams had almost caused a panic byhis garish tipsy account of 'what was going on in town,' and 'the manyrisks he ran when taking the mistress out.'Parker was overjoyed to see me, and so was Totsey. I found allstaunch, and ready, not only to protect themselves, but to fightanything, particularly the valiant Adams.On my way back to town I heard firing beyond the ridge east of us.Some men at practice probably, but it gave me a wrench and detractedfrom Adams's dignified bearing. More organising and drilling oftroops. I hear there is much suffering among them. The book-keeper,clerks, and indoor men find the unaccustomed exposure and fatiguetrying in the extreme. But they are a plucky lot, and stand for hourson guard in the scorching sun, and walk miles with their poorblistered feet with pathetic cheerfulness; swooning in many cases attheir posts rather than give in; to a man, eager to fight.Betty and I began our daily visits to the women and children at theWanderers' and Tattersall's to-day. At the Wanderers' alone are nearlythree hundred. The wonderful provision made for their health andcomfort spoke well for the intelligence as well as heart of theReform Committee, and Mr. Lingham, an American, who has that especialdepartment in charge. We found the dancing-hall of the Wanderers'converted into a huge dormitory, the supper-room into a sick ward, andthe skating-rink reserved for women newly confined--fright andexcitement having brought on many premature births. There is a matronin charge of the sick, and a medical inspector, who comes twice a dayto visit the different wards. I overheard him soundly berate a motherwho kept her children too much indoors. The food was good, and therewas plenty of it. Fresh cow's milk was supplied to the children. Inoticed a large vessel of galvanised iron marked 'Boiled water fordrinking purposes.' The little children were romping and tumblingabout with great energy. The women were wonderfully patient, Ithought, and firm in their adherence to the cause. This in some caseswas but vaguely understood, but there was a general belief that therewas 'goin' to be some fighten,' which was sure to make us all betteroff. I heard but one complaint, and that from a hulking slouch of aman who had sneaked in from duty to take a nap on the foot of his sickwife's pallet. He complained of the food, showing me the remains ofdainties given out to the sick woman, and _which he had helped her toeat_. The woman looked up at me with haggard eyes: 'It ain't thevittles, but the pain that's worrying me, ma'am.'A touching sight were the yelping dogs of every breed, family petstethered to the fence outside. All canteens are closed by order of theReform Committee as a precautionary measure, and where there was doubtof these precautions being observed, the liquors were bought andthrown away.Hundreds of varying rumours are afloat, which rush and swirl alonguntil lost in distorting eddies.This afternoon a horseman went through the town distributing aProclamation from the High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson:--     PROCLAMATION BY     _His Excellency the Right Hon. Sir Hercules George Robinson,     Bart., Member of Her Majesty's Most Hon. Privy Council,     K.C.B., of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and     St. George, Governor, Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's     Colony of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and of the     Territories, Dependencies thereof, Governor of the Territory     of British Bechuanaland, and Her Majesty's Commissioner,     &c., &c_.     'Whereas it has come to my knowledge that certain British     subjects, said to be under the leadership of Dr. Jameson,     have violated the territory of the South African Republic,     and have cut telegraph wires, and done various other illegal     acts; and     'Whereas the South African Republic is a friendly State in     amity with Her Majesty's Government; and whereas it is my     desire to respect the independence of the said State:     'Now therefore I hereby command the said Dr. Jameson and all     persons accompanying him, to immediately retire from the     territory of the South African Republic, on pain of the     penalties attached to their illegal proceedings; and I do     further hereby call upon all British subjects in the South     African Republic to abstain from giving the said Dr. Jameson     any countenance or assistance in his armed violation of the     territory of a friendly State.     'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.     'Given under my hand and seal this 31st day of December,     1895.          'HERCULES ROBINSON,              'High Commissioner.     'By command of His Excellency the High Commissioner.'Johannesburg is dumfounded!The sixth edition of the 'Star' this evening says that Jameson is onlyfifteen miles away, and that he has had a second encounter with theBoers. The populace has recovered from the Proclamation, and theirwild enthusiasm can scarcely be restrained. They want to go out tomeet Jameson and bring him in with triumphal outcry. It is hard to beonly a 'she-thing' and stay in the house with a couple of limber-kneedmen, when such stirring happenings are abroad.11 P.M.--Mr. Lionel Phillips has just addressed the crowd collectedaround the 'Gold Fields' waiting for news. He told them that theReform Committee Delegation--of which he was one--had been receivedwith courtesy by the Government Commission, the Chief Justice of theRepublic acting as chairman.They were assured that their proposals should be earnestly considered.Mr. Phillips then explained what was wanted, and reiterated the ReformCommittee's determination to stand by the Manifesto. He also told theCommission that the leaders of the Reform Committee had arranged withJameson to come to their assistance when necessary, but thatunfortunately he had come before required, probably through somemisunderstanding or false report. While the Reform Committee regrettedJameson's precipitate action, they would stand by him. And as they hadno means of stopping him they offered to prove their good faith bygiving their own persons as hostages that Jameson should leaveJohannesburg peacefully if he were allowed to come in unmolested. Thisoffer was rejected by the Commission, but a list of the names of theReform Committee was asked for.[3]As a result of this interview the Government decided to accept theoffer made by Her Majesty's High Commissioner to come to Pretoria tosettle differences and avoid bloodshed. An armistice was then agreedupon pending the High Commissioner's arrival. Mr. Phillips was ofteninterrupted by the crowd, some with cheers and others hooting. Onevoice called out, 'And how about Jameson?' Mr. Phillips answered, 'Iam instructed by the Reform Committee to state to you, as I did to theGovernment, that we intend to stand by Jameson. Gentlemen, I now callupon you to give three cheers for Dr. Jameson.' There was prolongedand enthusiastic cheering.The Reform Committee has sent out J.J. Lace to escort a messenger fromthe British Agent, who carries the Proclamation, and also to explainthe situation to Dr. Jameson.It is said that Lieutenant Eloff was captured by Jameson some milesbeyond Krugersdorp. Eloff declaring he had official orders to obstructhis advance, Jameson expressed his determination to go on, but addedthat he had no hostile intentions against the Government.JANUARY 2.--Betty and I sat up all night. The excitement is toointense to admit of hunger or fatigue. We know nothing beyond therumours of the street. Jameson is said to be at Langlaagte, fightinghis way into town, the Boers in hot pursuit.Mademoiselle has asked leave to go to the Convent to make her will.In the streets, private carriages, army wagons, Cape carts andambulances graze wheels. Every hour or two a fresh edition of the'Star' is published; public excitement climbing these bulletins, likesteps on a stair. We sit a half-dozen women in the parlour at Heath'sHotel. Two sisters weep silently in a corner. Their father is managerof the 'George and May'; a battle has been fought there a couple ofhours ago. No later news has come to them. A physician, with a hugered-cross badge around his arm, puts his head in at the door, andtells his wife that he is going out with an ambulance to bring in thewounded. At this we are whiter than before, if it were possible.Poor Mademoiselle returned an hour ago and was obliged to go to bed,done up with the nervous tension.Jacky is loose on the community; in spite of energetic endeavours(accompanied by the laying-on of hands in my case) his Aunt Betty andI cannot restrain his activity. He is intimate with the frequenters ofthe hotel bar, and on speaking terms with half the town. The day seemsendless.Things have gone so far, men want the issue settled, and perhaps theirresponsible are eager for a little blood-letting; there are certainprimitive instincts which are latent in us all, and the thought of waris stimulating.Mr. Lace returned this afternoon and reported that he had riddenthrough the lines to Jameson. He had had very little speech with thedoctor, as the time was short, and the messenger bearing theproclamation of the High Commissioner was also present. Jameson askedwhere the troops were. Lace told him that he could not rely on anyassistance from the Uitlanders, as they were unprepared, and anarmistice had been declared between the Boer Government and the peopleof Johannesburg.LATER.--News is brought of a battle fought at Doornkop this forenoon,and _Jameson has surrendered_. Johannesburg has gone mad.MIDNIGHT.--My husband has just come in, his face as white and drawn asa death mask.We talked earnestly, and then I insisted upon his going to bed, andfor the first time in three days he drew off his clothes and lay downto rest. The exhausted man now sleeps heavily; I sit beside himwriting by the spluttering candle. Now, while it is fresh in my mind,I am trying to put down all that I have just heard from my husband.He told me the Reform Committee were greatly surprised when theyreceived the report of Mr. Lace, as Jameson had no right to expectaid and succour from Johannesburg for the following reasons:--_First_.--In answer to a telegram from Jameson, expressingrestlessness at the delay, my husband wired him on December 27 avigorous protest against his coming._Second_.--Strong and emphatic messages were taken by Major Heaney,one of Jameson's own officers, to the same effect, also by Mr. Holden.Major Heaney went by special train from Kimberley, and Mr. Holden onhorseback across country.These messages informed Dr. Jameson that the time had not arrived forhis coming; that the people of Johannesburg were without arms, andthat his coming would defeat the aim and purposes of the wholemovement; and, further, that he could not expect any aid orco-operation from the people of Johannesburg.Notwithstanding all this, Jameson left Pitsani Sunday night, and thefirst intimation which Johannesburg had of his advance was throughtelegrams received Monday afternoon.The Reform Committee, thus informed of Jameson's coming, and knowingthat he was fully aware of their unarmed condition, believed that herelied only on his own forces to reach Johannesburg; and the Committeewere assured by Major Heaney and Captain White (two of Jameson'sofficers, the latter having two brothers with the invading force) thatno Boer force could stop him in his march; and this was confirmed byone of Jameson's troopers, who came from him this morning of thesurrender, and reported that he was getting along well; that, althoughhis horses were tired, he would reach Johannesburg within a few hours,and that he needed no assistance.The hope of the Committee was that, after receiving the proclamationof the High Commissioner, Jameson would retrace his steps instead ofpushing on.Monday, when we first heard of his starting, there were only 1,000guns, and very little ammunition in the country, and these werehidden away at the different mines. One thousand five hundred moreguns arrived next day. So desperate was the extremity, these guns weresmuggled in at great risk of being discovered by the Boer Custom Houseofficials, under a thin covering of coke on ordinary coal cars. Butfor the bold courage of several men, who rushed the coke through, theywould have fallen into the hands of the Boers. The leaders had takenas few men as was possible into their confidence, so as to reduce to aminimum all liability of their plans being discovered by theGovernment. They had made almost no organisation, and Jameson's suddenoncoming placed them in a terrible position. To confess at thisjuncture that the Reform Committee was short of guns would havedemoralised the people, and placed Johannesburg entirely at the mercyof the Boers. These leaders played a losing game with splendidcourage. Realising that all would be lost if the true situation weresuspected, and feeling the fearful responsibility of their position,they kept their counsel, and turned bold faces to the world,continuing to treat with Government with the independence ofwell-armed men, and men ready to fight.When the news of Jameson's surrender was confirmed this evening, thesurging crowd around the 'Gold Fields' became an excited and dangerousmob. Pressing thickly together, in their frenzy, they began to mutterthreats against the Reform Committee, and demanded, 'Where is Jameson?We thought you promised to stand by Jameson! Why didn't you give usguns and let us go out to help Jameson?'Plans were made to blow up the 'Gold Fields' where the Reformers satin session. Several gentlemen of the Committee essayed to speak fromthe windows, but were received with howls and curses from the stormytumult below. At last Mr. Samuel Jameson, brother to Dr. Jameson, madehimself heard:--'I beg you, for my brother's sake, to maintain a spirit of calmrestraint. We have done everything in our power for him, and used ourvery best judgment. In face of the complicated circumstances, no othercourse could have been taken.'It was as oil on the troubled waters.     JANUARY 3.--         FROM THE REFORM COMMITTEE.The Reform Committee issued the following notice at noon:--     '_Resolved_: That in view of the declaration by the     Transvaal Government to Her Majesty's Agent that the     mediation of the High Commissioner has been accepted, and     that no hostile action will be taken against Johannesburg     pending the results of these negotiations, the Committee     emphatically direct that under no circumstances must any     hostile action be taken by the supporters of the Reform     Committee, and that in the event of aggressive action being     taken against them, a flag of truce be shown, and the     position explained.     'In order to avoid any possibility of collision, definite     orders have been given. The matter is now left with the     mediation of the High Commissioner, and any breach of the     peace in the meanwhile would be an act of bad faith.     'By order of the Committee.'Deep and universal depression follows upon the great excitement.Jameson and his men are prisoners of war in Pretoria. Armed Boertroops encircle the town.One man said to me to-day: 'If we do get the franchise after losingonly thirty men, how much we will have gained and at how cheap aprice.'It was a man's view; birth and death could never mean so little to awoman!JANUARY 4.--The High Commissioner has arrived at Pretoria.They say poor Dr. Jameson is greatly dejected, and never speaks to asoul.JANUARY 5.--This beautiful Sunday, quiet and serene, dawns upon usfree of the sounds of the past week. No cries of newspaper boys norhurry of wheels. A couple of bands of recruits drilled for a whilesedately on Government Square, and then marched away. It is wonderfulto an American woman, who still retains a vivid recollection ofPresidential Elections, to see two warring factions at the mostcritical point of dispute mutually agree to put down arms and waitover the Sabbath, and more wonderful yet seems the self-restraint ofgoing without the daily paper. The George Washington Corps attended aspecial service. The hymns were warlike and the sermon strong andanything but pacific.JANUARY 6.--The Government issues an ultimatum: Johannesburg must laydown its arms.The letter of invitation signed by Messrs. Charles Leonard, FrancisRhodes, Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond and George Farrar, invitingDr. Jameson to come to the succour of Johannesburg under certaincontingencies, was printed in this morning's paper. It was picked upon the battlefield, in a leathern pouch, supposed to be Dr. Jameson'ssaddle-bag. _Why in the name of all that is discreet and honourabledidn't he eat it!_Two messengers from the High Commissioner, Sir Jacobus de Wet, theBritish Agent, and Sir Sydney Shippard, were received by the ReformCommittee this morning. De Wet told them that Johannesburg must laydown its arms to save Jameson and his officers' lives; that unlessthey complied with this appeal, which he made on behalf of the HighCommissioner, who was in Pretoria ready to open negotiations,Johannesburg would be responsible for the sacrifice of Jameson and hisfellow prisoners. It would be impossible for the Government to conductnegotiations with the High Commissioner for redress of grievancesuntil arms were laid down. He urged them to comply with this appeal toprevent bloodshed, and promised that they could depend upon theprotection of the High Commissioner, and that not 'a hair of theirheads would be touched.' After much discussion, the Committee agreedto lay down their arms.Betty and Mrs. Clement were busy all the morning giving out books andflowers which had been generously sent by various ladies andcommercial firms for distribution among the women and children at theWanderers' and Tattersall's. Betty says the women were most grateful.They are busy, hard-working women, and the enforced leisure is verytrying to them. She spoke with the manager of Tattersall's; he thankedher for her gifts, remarking, with some weariness in his tone: 'Youdon't know, Miss, how hard it is to keep the women amused andcontented--and several of them have been confined!' as if that, too,were a proof of insubordination.My husband tells me that the Committee is to hold a meeting atmidnight, and another at six to-morrow morning. He says that LionelPhillips nearly fainted from exhaustion to-day. Mr. Phillips isconsistent and brave, and George Farrar, too, is proving himself ahero. Dear old Colonel, with the kind thoughtfulness so characteristicof him, never fails to ask how we are bearing the trial.JANUARY 7.--Sir Jacobus de Wet and Sir Sydney Shippard addressed thepopulace from the Band Club balcony, exhorting them to accept theultimatum.LATER.--I have had such a reassuring conversation with Sir SydneyShippard this evening. He is a most intelligent man, and speaks withsuch fluent decisiveness that all he says carries conviction. I amtold that Sir Jacobus's speech was a rambling, poor affair and weak;the crowd showed a restlessness that at one time threatened to becomedangerous. He was fortunately pulled down by his coat-tails before thecrowd lost self-control.Sir Sydney's speech, on the contrary, was strong and full of feeling.He told the people that he sympathised deeply with them in theirstruggle for what he believed to be their just rights, but that beingan English Government official he could take no part. He reminded themthat Jameson was lying in prison, his life and the lives of hisfollowers in great jeopardy. The Government had made one condition forhis safety: the giving up of their arms. 'Deliver them up to your HighCommissioner, and not only Jameson and his men will be safe, but alsothe welfare of those concerned in this movement--I mean the leaders.'He continued: 'I, whose heart and soul are with you, say again thatyou should follow the advice of the High Commissioner, and I beg youto go home and to your ordinary avocations; deliver up your arms toyour High Commissioner, and if you do that you will have no occasionto repent it.'JANUARY 8.--Arms are being delivered up. About 1,800 guns alreadyhanded in. The Government assert that we are not keeping our agreementand are holding back the bulk of the guns. My husband tells me thatthese are being given up as fast as possible, but that there are notover 2,700 among the entire Uitlander population. The Reform Committeehas assured the High Commissioner that they are keeping good faith,but that they never had more than about 2,700. The disarmament isuniversally considered the first step to an amicable settlement. TheReform Committee has sent out orders and the guns are coming quietlyin. Everybody feels a certain relief now that the strain is eased; themembers of the Committee are dropping down into all sorts of oddplaces to make up for the lost sleep of the past week. Dozens arestretched on the floor of the club rooms. Some steady-going gentlemenof abstemious habit are unprejudiced enough to allow themselves to befound under the tables wrapped in slumber as profound as that ofinfancy.In contrast to my feelings of yesterday I am almost joyous. But forpoor impetuous Jameson and the newly dead and wounded of Doornkop, Icould laugh again.The women are going back to the mines. Many brave little men who haveremained in the shade to comfort their wives now step boldly to thefront and tell us what they would have done if it had really come to aquestion of fighting. There is so much talk of _moral courage_ fromthese heroes, I fear it is the only kind of courage which theypossess. One gentleman, not conspicuous for his bravery during thepreceding days, gravely said to me: 'If there had been war, I wonderif I should have had the moral courage to keep out of the fight?' Ilooked into his face, and, seeing there his character, answered withdryness, 'Oh! I suspect you would.' He was too complaisant toappreciate the sarcasm. God made little as well as great things! Isuppose we should love all humanity, even if it be in the spirit of acollector of curios.The protracted excitement has caused several deaths from heartfailure, and I heard of two cases of acute mania. There woulddoubtless have been a far greater mortality but for the fact thatJohannesburg is populated by young and, for the most part, vigorousmen and women.I hear that Dr. Jameson answered, when asked after his first night inthe Pretoria jail if there was anything he would like to have,'Nothing, thank you, but flea powder.'I sat on the verandah with Sir Sydney Shippard and Betty this eveningand watched the 'Zarps'[4] take control of the town. There was noremonstrance on the part of the populace.LATER.--It is rumoured that a Commando of Boers will attack the townto-night. The place is practically defenceless; most of the men havingreturned to their work and the companies being disbanded.[5]JANUARY 9.--There is a fearful impression abroad this morning that theReform Committee, or at least the leaders, will be arrested. Myhusband comforts me by saying the Government could not pursue such acourse after having recognised the Reform Committee and offered notonly to consider, but reform the grievances which have brought allthis trouble about. He declares that Great Britain would not allowthis after commanding her subjects to disarm and promising them herprotection, and to see that their wrongs were righted.'It would be the worst sort of faith,' he insists.NOON.--The situation is very strained. I can see that my husband istrying to prepare me for his possible arrest. 'It will merely be amatter of form.' Ah me! I can read in his grave face another truth.May God in His mercy grant us a happy issue out of all ourafflictions.At a quarter to ten on the night of January 9, my husband, with twodozen others of the Reform Committee, was arrested and thrown intojail on the charge of rebellion and high treason. They had heard thatthis was probable several hours earlier in the day.The four leaders were secretly offered a safe conduct over the border,but refused to forsake their comrades and the Cause. Leaving wordwhere he was to be found, and with the further stipulation that nohandcuffs were to be used in his arrest, or 'he would blow the brainsout of the first man who approached him,' my husband hastened tobreak the news gently to us. I packed a tiny handbag with necessariesand filled his pockets with cakes of chocolate; chocolate wasnourishing, and would sustain a hungry man hours, even days. We satdown hand in hand to wait for the officer, Betty in delicacy havingleft us alone together.The Australians were giving a banquet below stairs, and as we clung toeach other we could hear their shouts of boisterous mirth andhand-clapping. We started up at a tap on the door. A friend to tell usthe officer was waiting at the street entrance. I helped my husbandinto his coat and we kissed each other good-bye. He was filled withsolicitude for me. My thoughts were of the two thousand excited Boerslaagered between Johannesburg and Pretoria, but recollection of myunborn child steadied me and gave me self-command.Kind Mrs. Heath came to me, and, putting her arms about my shoulders,led me gently back into the bedroom, 'Mrs. Heath, will you pleasetell my sister-in-law that I am alone?' and Betty knew what hadhappened and came to me at once. Some time later Mr. John Stroyanbrought a note from my husband:--     Johannesburg Jail--2 A.M.     'We are well--a couple of dozen--waiting for the train to     Pretoria. Don't worry.     'Yours, J.H.H.'Then nature came to my relief. My overtaxed nerves refused to bear anymore--they were paralysed. I threw myself across the foot of my littleboy's bed, and lay like a dead woman until the morning broke....Many days afterward I heard further details of the arrest. Some of theincidences were amusing, as was the polite borrowing and making use ofMr. King's carriage--he being one of the Reformers--for conveyance ofthe prisoners to the gaol. At the Rand Club there was so large acollection of Reformers, that the carriages, even over-crowded, couldnot carry them all. Lieuts. de Korte and Pietersen, the officers incharge, said in the most friendly manner, 'Very well, gentlemen, someof you must wait until we can come back for you.' And they _did_ wait.Colonel Rhodes was taken from his own home; roused from his bed, hestood brushing his hair with martial precision, and expressing to theofficer his regret at putting him to the trouble of waiting while hedressed, Mr. Seymour Fort meanwhile packing his valise. 'Fort, oldman, put in some books,' said the Colonel, who is a great reader; 'allthe books you can find;' and Mr. Fort threw in book after book--bigones and little ones; and for this lavish provision the poor Colonelpaid dearly some hours later, in company with several husbands, whosewives in excess of tenderness had provided them with every knowntoilette luxury filled into silver-topped cut crystal bottles. Thesight of these afflicted men carrying their heavy burdens from thestation to the prison at Pretoria was both amusing and dramatic. Attimes their speech reached the epic.The sad side was poor Sam Jameson, crippled and broken withrheumatism--a seriously ill man--accompanied to the very prison gatesby his ever-faithful wife; and the second lot of Reformers, sent toPretoria the following morning, met with an experience which some ofthem have never since been able to speak of without turning white. Bythe hour of their arrival the whole country round about Pretoria knewof their coming, and a large and violent mob was gathered at therailroad station to receive them. Through some misadventure, aninadequate guard was detailed to march them to the gaol. The prisonerswere set upon by the mob, reviled, stoned, and spat upon, the officersin charge trampling them under their horses' hoofs, in their vain andexcited endeavours to protect them. The poor prisoners reached thejail in a full run, bruised and breathless, but thankful for theasylum the prison door afforded them from their merciless pursuers.They were quickly locked into cells. For many hours they had nottasted food. The first Reformers imprisoned slipped in to them a partof their own provisions, but as it was quickly and stealthily done onecell would receive the pannikin of meat, another the tin of potatoes,&c. The cells were in a filthy condition. As has been truly said, aBoer prison is not built for gentlemen. It was an unavoidablemisfortune that this prison, which had up to this time housed onlyrefractory Kaffirs, should by force of circumstance become thedomicile for six long dreary months, and through a hot tropicalsummer, of gentlemen nurtured in every decency. Captain Mein told methat he stood the greater part of that first night rather than situpon the filthy floor, but exhaustion at length conquered hisrepugnance. These were times which proved men's natures. It distilledthe very essence of a man, and if anywhere in his make-up was the saltof selfishness, it was pretty sure to appear. Many who before hadappreciated Charlie Butter's open hospitality, realised now that itwas more than kindliness which prompted him to give up his lastswallow of whisky to a man who was older or weaker than himself. Andthey tell me that my own good man's cheery spirits helped along many afellow of more biliary temperament.The four leaders were put into a cell 11 feet by 11 feet, which wasclosed in by an inner court. There was no window, only a narrow grilleover the door. The floor was of earth and overrun by vermin. Of thefour canvas cots two were blood-stained, and all hideously dirty. Theywere locked in at 6 o'clock--one of them ill with dysentery--and therethey remained sweltering and gasping through the tropical night untilsix of the morning. For two weeks they remained in this cell.Meanwhile, I knew nothing of my husband's plight, being mercifullydeceived by both him and our friends, every day Mr. Heath bringing toParktown telegrams from my husband assuring me of his good treatmentby the Government, and imploring me not to worry.The Reform Committee consisted of seventy-eight members; sixty-fourwere arrested. One of this number subsequently committed suicide in atemporary fit of insanity caused by protracted anxiety and prisonhardship.The Committee was composed of men of many nationalities and variousprofessions--lawyers, doctors, and, with only one or two exceptions,all the leading mining men on the Rand. The Young Men's ChristianAssociation was well represented, and a Sunday-school Superintendentwas one of the list.I returned to my home, and was in the doctor's care, and attended by aprofessional nurse.By my Journal I see how good was Mr. Seymour Fort and how faithful Mr.Manion, the American Consular Agent, during this time of trial. Fromthe flat of my back I listened to and took into consideration manyplans suggested for the liberation of my husband. One lady proposedgetting up a petition, which she would take to England to the Queen.It was to be headed with my name, as wife of one of the leaders: Mrs.Lionel Phillips being in Europe, and Mrs. George Farrar at the Cape;Colonel Rhodes a bachelor. I had small hopes of the success of thingswhich had to be sent to Court, or placed before Courts. The subjectwas dismissed.Then there was another plan thought out by a very shrewd man, andbrought to my bedside, 'news which concerns your husband' being apassport to any one. I was to go at once to Cape Town, see Mr. CecilRhodes, and demand one hundred thousand dollars from him.'What for?' I asked.'You see,' said the gentleman, 'your husband and those other men aregoing to be tried _sure_, and we need money to lobby Pretoria.'I was stupid--it was my first Revolution--and I hadn't the least ideawhat lobbying Pretoria meant. My friend gave me a sketchy view of itsmeaning, and assured me it was usually done in grave cases.'But it will kill me to leave my bed and start for Cape Townto-morrow,' I exclaimed.My adviser delicately hinted that my husband's life was of more valuethan my own. On this point we agreed. I was to make Mr. Rhodesunderstand that we didn't want any more 'tom-fool military men up hereto ball up the game.'He was to give the money to me unconditionally, to be disbursed as myfriend saw fit. We rehearsed the part several times; I was hopelesslydull!'And now,' he questioned, 'if Rhodes refuses to give you the money,what will you do?'I thought of Jael and Charlotte Corday, and all the other women whohad to do with history, and said, 'I suppose I'll have to shoot him.'My preceptor looked discouraged. We went over the part once again.It is but fair to say that he had made every provision for my comfort.Attendants were ready, and at the right moment I have no doubt butthat a neat pine coffin could have been produced. Reflection, however,showed me the inadvisability of this project; but I was happily sparedthe embarrassment of drawing back from promised compliance.There was a higher power ruling. The next morning's papers announcedthe sailing of C.J. Rhodes for England.The morning of January 10th, Johannesburg disarmed, and the Reformersin prison, the President of the Transvaal Republic issued aproclamation offering pardon to all who should lay down their arms,and declaring them to be exempt from prosecution on account of whathad occurred at Johannesburg--'_with the exception of all persons orbodies who may appear to be principal criminals, leaders, instigators,or perpetrators of the troubles at Johannesburg and suburbs_. Suchpersons or bodies will justify themselves before the legal andcompetent Courts of this Republic'The principal criminals, leaders, instigators, or perpetrators werethe same to whom was tendered the olive-branch brought from Pretoriaby Messrs. Malan and Marais, acting envoys by the unanimous vote ofthe Executive; and three of these same principal criminals, leaders,instigators, or perpetrators were received seven days since, asrepresentatives of the Reform Committee, in a conciliatory spirit bythe Government's Special Commission, and told that their demands wouldbe earnestly considered. During the intervening seven days Dr. Jamesonhad been conquered at Doornkop and made a prisoner of the State. TheReform Committee, in obedience to Sir Jacobus de Wet's long and prolixsolicitation, and the strong appeal of Sir Sydney Shippard, assuringthem that Jameson's life was in imminent danger, and the Governmenthad made Johannesburg's disarmament the one condition of his safety,laid down their arms to preserve the life of a man already protectedby the terms of his own surrender. 'Placing themselves,' cables theHigh Commissioner to Mr. Chamberlain, 'and their interestsunreservedly in my hands, in the fullest confidence that I will seejustice done them.' The sixty-four Reformers were then promptly driveninto jail, and their property placed under an interdict.Six months later, the four principal leaders were tried and sentencedto be hanged by their necks until they were dead, by a judge _broughtfrom a neighbouring Republic, the Orange Free State_, for thatpurpose.FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 3: This list was used as a roll-call a week later in thearrest of the Sixty-four members.][Footnote 4: Abbreviated term for South African police.][Footnote 5: The following cablegram will show that there were verysubstantial grounds for the rumour:--'Sir Hercules Robinson (Pretoria) to Mr. Chamberlain.--8thJanuary--No. 3. Since my telegram No. 1 of this morning matters havenot been going so smoothly. When the Executive Council met I receiveda message that only 1,814 rifles and three Maxim guns had beensurrendered, which the Government of the South African Republic didnot consider a fulfilment of the ultimatum, and orders would beimmediately issued to a Commando to attack Johannesburg. I at oncereplied that the ultimatum required the surrender of guns andammunition for which no permit of importation had been obtained, andthat onus rested with the Transvaal Government to show that guns andammunition were concealed for which no permit had been issued. Ifbefore this was done any hostile step were taken against JohannesburgI should consider it a violation of the undertaking for which I hadmade myself personally responsible to the people of Johannesburg, andI should leave the issue in the hands of Her Majesty's Government ...']IVSUNDAY, JANUARY 12.--Mr. and Mrs. Perkins called this morning toadvise Betty's not going immediately to Pretoria, as was herintention. Mr. Perkins said that the Boer feeling was very bitter, andforeign women were insulted in the streets. Advocate Wessels has alsowritten to me, insisting upon my waiting two or three days, as mypresence in Pretoria could do no good, and might prejudice myhusband's cause. A little trunk was packed and sent to my husband lastnight. I got out of bed to superintend, and felt tragically tender asI watched the things laid in. A fresh suit of clothes, some personaland bed linen, towels, shoes, family photographs, flea powder,ginger-snaps, beef essence, soap, my little down pillow, and hisbeloved and well-read Shakespeare. I was able to sit up for an hourthis afternoon to receive Sir Sydney Shippard, Mr. Seymour Fort, andMr. Manion.Yesterday the Governor of Natal, Sir Walter Hely Hutchinson, startedfor Pretoria to confer with the High Commissioner in regard to thetransport of Dr. Jameson and his men through Natal. They are to behanded over to the English Government.Search parties of mounted Boers are going about looking for hiddenguns. The Robinson Mine seems to be the spot most suspected.Yesterday's 'Volksstem'--a Government organ--recalled to the minds ofthe Boers the Slachter Nek affair of eighty years ago--a story ofBoers hung by Englishmen for their insistence in punishing a negroslave according to established custom. What a cruel sinistersuggestion underlies this![6]Keen resentment is felt here against the young German Emperor and hisindiscreet message to Kruger. I never dreamed years ago, when I usedto see him, a tall, slender-legged boy in Berlin, that in maturity Ishould have so strong a desire to chastise him. England hascommissioned a Flying Squadron, and the forces at Cape Town are to bestrongly augmented.JANUARY 13.--Mr. Manion showed me to-day a cable from the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Mr. Olney. 'Take instant measures toprotect John Hays Hammond, and see that he has fair play.' It broughtsuch a feeling of confidence and comfort! All he wants _is_ fair play,and I pray to God that he may be protected until he gets it.Many business meetings had to be postponed to-day on account of thelarge number of influential men in jail. I hear from Mr. ---- that onThursday and Friday it was most difficult to keep the Boers fromstorming the town. President Kruger dissuaded them by promising each anew suit of clothes. These they have since been seen carrying, tiedto the cantle of their saddles.Feeling is strong and bitter against the leaders; they are heldresponsible for all the trouble brought about by the Jameson invasion.Commandant Cronje's Burgher force paraded the street thismorning--they are the men who captured Jameson. Jameson is the god ofthe hour, and Johannesburg resented the intrusion; but for the sake oftheir hero, still in the power of the Government, there was noindication of intolerance beyond a few audible sarcasms; remarks whichwere answered in kind by the Burghers.Betty says they were an interesting-looking body of men;strong-framed, heavy-featured, with long unkempt hair and beards. Theyrode shaggy, moth-eaten-looking little ponies, each man with a bundleof hay bound to his saddle and a sausage in his wallet. Fathers amongthem as hale as the brawny sons by their sides. They looked capableof any amount of fatigue.Numbers of stray dogs and cats attest the many deserted homes.JANUARY 15.--Every train brings women and children, hobby-horses andcanary birds back to their homes in Johannesburg. Betty has returned,accompanied by Mr. Seymour Port, from Pretoria. She gives a veryspirited account of her visit. Through Mr. Sauer, one of the advocatesretained by the Reformers, a visiting permit was obtained. She and Mr.Fort were obliged to wait several hours, in company with a crowd ofwives, at the prison gates, under a broiling sun. All were loaded downwith offerings.Betty's own donation was several green-lined umbrellas (a god-send ina whitewashed court beat upon by a tropical sun). After being admittedeach lady was taken into a private room and 'felt all over by a Boerwoman,' who was so fat, Betty declares, 'she must have grown up inthe room, as she could not possibly have got through the door, evensideways.'In the prison court the prisoners were sitting about in greatdiversity of costume, pyjamas predominating. The weather wassuffocatingly hot. To while away the tedious time some were playingmarbles, others reading, and a few of the most active brains on theRand were caught dozing at midday, in a strip of shadow the width ofone's hand, the sole shade in the whole enclosure. Colonel Bettingtonsat on a bench near the entrance in a peculiar and striking costumewhich proved to be, to those who had courage to linger and analyse,pyjama drawers rolled to the knees, a crash towel draped with happyblending of coolness and perfect propriety around body, noble Bedouinarrangement of wet crash towel on head, single eyeglass in eye, merrysmile. Mr. Lace was the only one of the company who could suddenlyhave been set down in Piccadilly without confusion to himself andbeholders. He wore a neat brown suit, pale pink shirt, and a_stylish_ straw sailor hat. The prisoners showed a touching interest,Betty says, in the distribution of their gifts. One husband asked hiswife almost before she was within arm's length what she had broughthim. She had brought him a box of Pasta Mack tabloids, andunfortunately there was not at that time a bath in the whole prison.Another gentleman was presented with a Cologne spray. He was the envyof the jail; within twenty-four hours every Cologne spray in Pretoriawas bought up and in the possession of the Reform Committee.The four leaders are kept apart. After much ceremony my husband wasallowed to see his sister at the door of the inner court where theyare housed. Jameson and his men are in a tiny cottage by themselves,and no communication whatever is allowed between the prisoners.Arrangements have been made with the authorities to allow food to beserved to the Reformers from the Pretoria Club at the prisoners'expense. The head jailer, Du Plessis, is a cousin of Kruger's. Aponderous man with a wild beard, a blood-shot eye, and a heavy voice.He is said to have gone to the President several days after the arrestand said, 'Those men are not like us, they are gentlemen, and cannotstand such hardships.' 250,000,000 are estimated as being representedby the men within the four walls of the Pretoria jail.President Kruger suggests the adjournment of the Volksraad. Every onefeels this to be a wise move while party spirit runs so high. TheHollanders in the Transvaal are much more rabid against the Reformersthan the Boers.Mr. Chamberlain has cabled to the High Commissioner respecting theleaders in the recent rising. He points out that their imprisonmentmay disorganise the mining industry, and inquires as to what will bethe likely penalties.America has asked Great Britain to protect Americans arrested inJohannesburg. I hear that a Burgher, who saw some of the great ironpipes of the Waterworks Company being put in the ground, reachedPretoria in a state of intense excitement, exclaiming that he had seen'miles of big guns at Johannesburg.'Mr. Andrew Trimble, chief detective and head of the Uitlander police,quitted Johannesburg the night of the arrest with much precipitation;unfortunately, before indeed he had filed away his most importantprivate papers. Following his hasty flight his office was carefullyguarded by Zarps; no one was allowed to enter--'Oh yes, the Kaffir boymight go in to clean up.' A good friend of Mr. Trimble's, with sternaspect, instructed the boy to make a 'good job' of the room and burnall the papers strewn over the floor and desks. This was faithfullydone by the unconscious negro, to the entire satisfaction of all savethe Zarps in charge.It is said Dr. Jameson entered the Transvaal with his despatch-boxfilled with important papers in cypher, _and the cypher code withit_. I cannot believe this of any man in his sound senses.The High Commissioner left Pretoria by special train yesterday. Thiswas the man who offered his service as Mediator and was accepted byboth Uitlander and Boer. To placate the Boer he refrained fromvisiting Dr. Jameson and his men imprisoned at Pretoria, nor did hepermit Sir Jacobus de Wet to visit them. He never acquainted himselfwith the terms of Dr. Jameson's surrender. He commanded Johannesburgto disarm to appease the Boer, and this being successfullyaccomplished through the self-control of the Reform Committee, hedeparted with his gout and other belongings, leaving the unarmedbetrayed Reformers to shift for themselves. Was this being a Mediator?FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 6: This affair was the result of an interference by theEnglish. It arose out of the ill-treatment of a negro slave. The Boersresisted arrest, there was a clash of arms, and four of the Boers werehanged.]VJANUARY 21.--The Burghers are disbanding and returning to their homes.Trade is thoroughly unsettled, and business of every kind is in anunsatisfactory condition. Great disorder prevails in the town.Scarcely a night but there is some sort of disturbance betweencitizens and police; the latter are mostly raw German recruits.Dr. Jameson and his officers left Pretoria yesterday. Dr. Jamesonlooked very downcast, and sat gazing stolidly before him until thetrain started. They were cheered at many places along the route. TheUnited States Government has thanked Mr. Chamberlain for his offer toprotect Americans in the Transvaal.All travellers coming into the country must submit to a rigorouspersonal search for firearms at Vereeniging. In one case even theinfant of the party was overhauled for guns and ammunition beforebeing handed over to the loving father, who had come down to meet hislittle family.LATER.--I came up to Pretoria this afternoon with Betty and the sicknurse. We were stopped at the station while the officials examined ourhandbags for cannon. This delay would have been irritating, but themen were so universally good-natured--little dull-witted, with noappreciation of fitness, but good-natured. We drove at once to theGrand Hotel, and I went to bed that I might look rested when I saw myhusband on the morrow. Lady de Wet and Dr. Messum, the prisonphysician, called to tell me the four men had been moved into theJameson Cottage, but I was asleep, and not allowed to be roused. Thereis comfort in being this much nearer to my poor prisoner. The hotel isfull of Reformers' wives, and there is much excitement and coming andgoing. We are warned to be cautious in what we say in public places,because of spies. Every woman has a nervous look on her face, and someof them shut the windows and doors before uttering even the mostcommonplace remarks.Pretoria lies in a shallow basin in the heart of the hills--a fittinghome for the Sleeping Princess. It is hushed and drowsy and overrun bya tangle of roses. Weeping willows edge the streets, which are wideand as neglected as a country road. Open gutters carry off, or rathercontain, the sewage of the town. Its altitude is lower than that ofJohannesburg, and the climate very relaxing. Every month or couple ofmonths the town is full of stir and life. The Boers trek in fromneighbouring farms with their long span of oxen, as many as eighteenand twenty being yoked to a wagon. They buy and sell, and partake ofthe Nacht Maal, or sacrament, laagered around the Dopper Church; andwith their dogs, Kaffirs, and oxen make of that square a mostunsavoury spot.JANUARY 24.--I have been several times to the prison, and have seen myhusband. He looks thin, but his face is much rested. He was greatlydistressed on my first visit at the change in my appearance, which Ideclared was most ungrateful, as I had put on my best clothes for theoccasion. His mouth showed a tendency to grow square at the corners; Ihad seen his children's do the same a thousand times in our nursery,and I turned away to conceal my emotion.The leaders are still kept apart from the other Reformers, a chalkedline showing the margin of their liberty. They are fairly comfortablein the Jameson Cottage. It contains two tiny rooms; in one all foursleep, and the other is used for a sitting-room. These are kept veryclean and bright. Mr. Farrar is housekeeper, and 'tidies up' with suchvigour that his three comrades threaten to give up their lodgings anddecamp.'Hang it all,' says Mr. Phillips, 'we never sit down to a meal thatGeorge does not begin to sweep the floor'; 'And he takes our cups awayand begins washing them before we've finished our coffee,' complainsthe Colonel. Mr. Farrar reproaches me for my husband's want of order.He says I have not trained him at all, which is quite the truth. Eachman has his chief treasures on a little shelf above his bed. The threehusbands have photographs of wife and children; Colonel Rhodes, thebachelor, a sponge-bag and pin-cushion. Every day I find a short listof things which they want got for them. It is many a long year sincethey had such simple desires: bed-sheets and pillow-cases, a shade fortheir window, Dutch dictionary, and lead pencils.JANUARY 25.--The Reformers, with the exceptions of Messrs. LionelPhillips, George Farrar, Colonel Rhodes, John Hays Hammond, and PercyFitzpatrick, are released to-day on bail of ten thousand dollarseach. They are not permitted to leave Pretoria however.JANUARY 27.--Dr. Jameson has sailed on the 'Victoria' for England. TheGovernor of Natal was hooted at Volksrust for congratulating PresidentKruger on his defeat of Jameson.We are again in Pretoria. I have asked for an interview with thePresident.       *       *       *       *       *     _My First Prison Pass_     BEWIJS VAN TOEGANG     Aan den Cipier van de Gevangenis te     Pretoria.     Verlof wordt verliend aan Mrs. Hammond     en Miss Hammond en Lady de Wet     Om den gevangene genaamd Hammond,     Phillips, Rhodes en Farrar te bezoeken in     Uwe tegenwoordigheid.     Den 22nd--1--1896.VISir James Sivewright said, as I left my rooms for the President'shouse, 'I am glad that you are going. You will find a man with a roughappearance but a kind heart.' Mr. Sammy Marx accompanied me.The home of the President of the South African Republic is anunpretentious dwelling, built of wood and on one floor. There is alittle piazza running across the front, upon which he is frequentlyseen sitting, smoking his pipe of strong Boer tobacco, with a coupleof his trusted burghers beside him. Two armed sentinels stood at thelatch gate. I hurried through the entrance. A negro nurse wasscurrying across the hall with a plump baby in her arms. A young manwith a pleasant face met me at the sitting-room door and invited meto enter. It was an old-fashioned parlour, furnished with blackhorse-hair, glass globes, and artificial flowers. A marble-toppedcentre table supported bulky volumes bound in pressed leather withlarge gilt titles. There were several men already in the room, Boers.Those nearest the door I saw regard me with a scowl. I was a womanfrom the enemy's camp. At the further end of the long room sat a largesallow-skinned man with long grizzled hair swept abruptly up from hisforehead. His eyes, which were keen, were partly obscured by heavyswollen lids. The nose was massive, but not handsome. The thin-lippedmouth was large and flexible, and showed both sweetness and firmness.A fine mouth! He wore a beard. It was President Kruger. He was fillinghis pipe from a moleskin pouch, and I noticed that his broad stoopingshoulders ended in arms abnormally long. We shook hands, and hecontinued to fill and light his pipe. Mr. Grobler, the pleasant-facedyoung man, grandson and Secretary to the President, observing that Iwas trembling with fatigue and suppressed excitement, offered me achair. We sat opposite each other, the President in the middle. Ispoke slowly, Mr. Grobler interpreting. This was hardly necessary,President Kruger answering much that I said before it was interpreted.I could understand him perfectly from my familiarity with German andespecially _Platt-Deutsch_.I explained that I had not come to talk politics. 'No, no politics,'interrupted the President in a thick loud voice. Nor had I come to askfavour for my husband, as I felt assured that the honesty of hismotives would speak for themselves at the day of his trial; but I_had_ come as a woman and daughter of a Republic to ask him tocontinue the clemency which he had thus far shown, and to thank Mrs.Kruger for the tears which she had shed when Johannesburg was inperil.President Kruger relaxed a little. 'That is true, she did weep.' Hefixed me with his shrewd glance. 'Where were you?' he asked abruptly.'I was in Johannesburg with my husband.''Were you not afraid?''Yes, those days have robbed me of my youth.''What did you think I was going to do?''I hoped that you would come to an understanding with the Reformers.'His face darkened.'I was disappointed that the Americans went against me,' he said.Mr. Sammy Marx rose and left the room. I was seized with one of thosesudden and unaccountable panics, and from sheer embarrassment--my moodwas far too tragic to admit of flippancy--blurted out, 'You must cometo America, Mr. President, as soon as all this trouble is settled, andsee how _we_ manage matters.'Kruger's face lighted up with interest. 'I am too old to go so far.''No man is older than his brain, Mr. President'; and Kruger, who knewthat in all the trouble he had shown the mental vigour of a man in hisprime, accepted my praise with a hearty laugh. This was joined in bythe Boers from the other end of the room.Mrs. Kruger refused to see me, and I liked her none the less for herhonest prejudice. I stood to go. President Kruger rose, removed thepipe from between his teeth, and, coughing violently, gave me hishand.Mr. Grobler escorted me to the gate. 'Mrs. Hammond, I shall be glad toserve you in any way possible to me,' he said with courtesy.'Then will you say to Mrs. Kruger that I am praying to the same Godthat peace may come?'MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3.--The preliminary trial of the Reform Committeeprisoners was called this morning. The hearing was in the secondRaadzaal. Although the accommodation for the public was limited therewas a large crowd of Johannesburgers present.Shortly before ten o'clock an armed escort marched up to the jail forMessrs. Hammond, Phillips, Farrar, Fitz-Patrick, and Rhodes. The otherReformers stood in a bunch at the entrance of the hall. All theprincipal Government officials were present. Sir Jacobus de Wetappeared, accompanied by Mr. J. Rose Innes, Q.C., who had come fromthe Cape to watch the case on behalf of the Imperial Government.Punctually at ten the State Attorney, Coster, took his seat, and,beginning with my husband's name, called the accused into Court.The sixty-four prisoners were assigned to rows of cane-bottomed chairsin the north-west corner of the building. The proceedings were inDutch, and continued throughout the day. With the exception of a few,none of the Reformers understood Dutch. The hall was withoutventilation, and overcrowded, and sixty-four more bored anddisconsolate-looking men, I believe, were never brought together. Someof them fanned vigorously with their hats, others gave themselves upto circumstance and sank into apathy. On the second day, profiting byexperience, fans and paper-backed novels were brought into the Courtroom by the arraigned.When the Reformers filed in I noticed my husband was not amongst them.Captain Mein caught my eye and beckoned me to come down from theladies' gallery. I hurried to him in some alarm. He told me that myhusband was not well, and handed me a permit which Advocate Sauer hadprocured for me. I went at once to the prison, and found my husbandwith acute symptoms of dysentery, a feeble pulse, and a heart whichmurmured when it beat.'Jack,' I said, 'I am going to dig you out of this jail!'He looked incredulous, and said despondently, 'I'd rather stay _here_than go to the prison hospital.''I'm not thinking of the prison hospital,' simply to reassure him, andwith absolutely no plan of procedure in mind I smiled wisely.On my way back to the hotel I was perplexed and uncertain which end totry first--the American Government or the Government of the Transvaal.I decided upon the latter, and, assisted by Advocate Scholtz, set towork with such good effect that by the end of the day I had receivedpermission to remove my invalid into a private house and personallyattend him. Captain Mein cabled to Mr. David Benjamin, who was inEngland, for the use of his cottage. An answer returned within a fewhours, granting us cordial possession.I was told that we should be kept under strict guard and that anofficer would be lodged in the house with us. Colonel Bettingtonadvised me to ask the Government that this officer might be Lieutenantde Korte, who was a gentleman, and a man of kindly instincts. This Idid, and again my wishes were generously considered. My first act inthe cottage home was to cable the United States Secretary of State ofmy privilege; Betty and my faithful housemaid, Parker, were allowed tobe with us.Thirteen men were stationed on guard around the tiny flower-coveredcottage. No letters or telegrams were allowed to be sent or receivedwithout first being read by Lieutenant de Korte; visitors were obligedto obtain permits to see us, and many were the times I saw my bestfriends hang disconsolate faces over the garden gate, because theprescribed number of passes had already been distributed.The ladies of the house were allowed to go out twice in the week. Inever accepted this freedom. Betty did once, and returning after hourswas refused entrance by the sentinel. Fortunately Mr. de Korte cameto the rescue. Another time, in consequence of a change of guard, hehimself was obliged to show his papers before being allowed to leavethe premises. Lieutenant de Korte was excessively strict, as was hisduty to the Government, but throughout the two weeks we were under hiscare he proved himself entirely worthy of Colonel Bettington's praise,'A gentleman and a man of kindly instincts!' One piece of kindness Iparticularly appreciated. _He never wore his uniform in the house_.When he sat down to table it was in the usual evening dress of a manof the world, and our conversation was always on pleasant subjects. Wenever forgot, however, that we were prisoners. My husband and I sleptlike Royalty in the throne-room, with all the Court assembled. Oneguard sat at our bedroom door, gun in hand, and two others on theverandah just outside the low window. I could hear their breathingthroughout the night. My husband and I could never exchange a privateword; sometimes I would write a message which was hurriedly burnt inthe bedroom candle. The day we moved into the cottage I saw a rose inthe garden which I thought would please and refresh my patient. Istepped over the threshold to find my nose in conjunction with thehighly-polished barrel of an unfriendly rifle. There was no necessityfor me to understand the guttural speech of the guard, to appreciatethat he desired me to return into the house at once. I did so. Effortsto induce Mr. Hammond to take a little exercise in the garden I soongave over. After a few steps (a guard only two feet behind him) hewould be utterly exhausted, and would almost faint away on reachinghis chair again. Under these petty irritations my husband showed anangelic patience and fortitude that alarmed me. It was so unlike hisnormal self. I longed to hear him cuss a cosy swear; it would havebraced us both. But he was gentle, and appreciative of littlekindnesses; so, to keep from weakening tears, I took to swearingmyself.Pretoria was like a steam bath. Frequent thunderstorms were followedby a blazing sun. Vegetation grew inches in a day, and emitted a ranksmell. People were sallow and languid, and went about withyellow-white lips. My husband was losing strength perceptibly.I called upon Dr. Messum, and begged that he would summon Dr. Murray,our family physician, from Johannesburg, in consultation. He preferreda Hollander. I would have none of them! We haggled, and he gave in.Dr. Murray came to Pretoria. He was very grave when he came out of myhusband's sick room. His report to the Government gained the allowanceof a daily drive, but even for this slight exertion the sick man wassoon too feeble. I wanted to take him to the bracing heights ofJohannesburg, but lawyers and physicians advised me not to make thisrequest. Johannesburg was still a red rag to the Government, and Iwould be sure to meet with a rebuff. Notwithstanding, I went one nightat eleven o'clock, escorted by Lieutenant de Korte, carrying aglimmering lantern, to interview Dr. Schaagen van Leuwen, and laid thecase before him.My husband would surely die if kept in Pretoria; the Governmentphysician who had been attending him could attest the truth of mystatement. I begged to be allowed to take him to his home inJohannesburg, under whatever restrictions or guard the Governmentmight choose to impose. _Johannesburg was my desire_, and I positivelyrefused to accept any alternative. Dr. Schaagen van Leuwen was verykind, and promised to do all he could to help me, and he gave me goodreason to hope that my request would be considered.In the morning I went again to visit Dr. Messum, this time with Mr.Percy Farrar. I urged him to send in his report of my husband's caseat once, as he seemed inclined to let the matter drift. Mr. Farrarand I also drew his attention to the condition of the Jameson Cottage.The walls were covered with mildew from the recent rains and the floordamp with seepage water. Mr. Phillips was suffering from lumbago, andMr. Fitzpatrick with acute neuralgia.Next day we were pleasantly surprised by a call at the cottage fromMessrs. Phillips, Farrar, and Colonel Rhodes, liberated under the sameconditions as was my husband--a bail of 50,000 dollars and a heavyguard. They were then on their way to a cottage at Sunnyside. Mrs.Farrar and I hugged each other with joy, and were quite ready to dothe same to the lawyers who had been so successful in attaining thisend. When I learned a little later that consent had been given for Mr.Hammond to be taken to Johannesburg my measure of happiness seemedindeed complete.With all speed Parker and I tied up our belongings. Lieutenant deKorte, with nine guards, was to attend us as far as Johannesburg. Abed was made for the sick man on one of the seats, and frequentstimulants helped him bear the journey. The thought of going home didas much as the cordials to stay his strength, I shall always believe.A number of gentlemen of my husband's staff were at the station tomeet us. Mr. Catlin's kind face I could see above all the others, anddear Pope Yeatman's. Before we could exchange greetings we werewhisked off into our carriage by the officer whose duty it was to takeus in charge. A soldier hopped up on the box, and another plantedhimself on the seat opposite to us--to my inconvenience, and Parker'sintense indignation. Our home was alight. There was a good dinner onthe table, and my husband, with his natural hospitality, invited theofficer to share it with us. I think I should have shot him if he hadaccepted--but he did not accept.There had been a fearful dynamite explosion at Fordsburg, a suburb ofJohannesburg, late in the afternoon, and he was busied with bringingin the wounded. Very politely he asked me to take him through thehouse. This I did, grimly remarking, as I pointed to the window in mydressing-room, 'That is the one he will escape by when we have made upour minds to run.' This cheap wit cost me weeks of inconvenience, forthe literal Hollander took me at my word, and posted a guard directlyopposite this window. Being a Vrywilliger[7] and a gentleman, thispoor man suffered as sharply from his position as did I. That nighttwo armed men stood at our chamber door. One was stationed at each ofour bedroom windows. Another guarded the house entrance, and theremainder of the guard were dispersed around the yard. Their guns wereloaded, and a bandolier of cartridges crossed their breasts. All thisto restrain a poor, broken man, who could not walk a dozen yards!FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 7: A volunteer.]VIIASH WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19.--The dynamite explosion was somethingterrific. Fifty-five tons exploded at one time, wounding 700 people,killing 80, and leaving 1,500 homeless. It ripped a chasm in the earthdeep enough to hold an Atlantic steamer with all her rigging. TheKaffirs thought the sun had burst. Betty says the noise of the reportwas something awful. Little Jacky was digging in the garden at thetime. He returned to the house at once with a very troubled face. Thecoachman coming from town an hour later told of the dreadfulcatastrophe. Jacky took his aunt aside: 'Aunt Bet, I heard that greatbig noise when I was diggin' and I thought I had dug up hell.'The explosion was the result of neglect. For four days fifty-five anda half tons of dynamite lay under a hot sun at the NetherlandsRailroad junction, left in charge of an inexperienced youth of twentywho had 'forgotten to remove it' as was ordered the day before theexplosion occurred.Fordsburg is populated by poor Dutch and Boers. With generousdisregard of recent conflicts, the Uitlanders at once gave help andsympathy to the afflicted. Seven of the members on the ReliefCommittee were Reformers; and Reformers' wives were among the first tonurse the wounded. President Kruger came over to Johannesburg to visitthe scene of the accident. He visited the wounded at the Wanderers'and hospital, and seemed greatly affected. He made a speech in whichhe begged the sufferers to turn their eyes to the Great Healer, whoalone could comfort. He also said that he was gratified to hear thatthe subscriptions in aid of the distressed had reached so high afigure; 'Johannesburg had come nobly to the rescue, and he was glad toknow it.' He quoted the words of the Saviour, 'Blessed are themerciful, for they shall obtain mercy.' In benefiting others hedeclared they would benefit themselves.FEBRUARY 23.--I am housed with my ill husband. Betty comes in and goesout in constant service to the sufferers from the dynamite explosion.We can think of nothing else. All the tragic stories we hear fromfriends and read in the papers fill our days with sadness.A friend of my cook's was visiting a neighbour at Fordsburg. She stoodon the threshold, an infant in her arms, and a three-year-old boy ather side. The explosion came. Her baby was killed outright, and thechild clinging to her skirts dropped with one leg ripped entirely fromthe socket. The mother was not even scratched. Another woman wassewing on a sewing machine. After recovering from the shock, she foundherself unhurt, her house collapsed, and the sewing machine entirelydisappeared. Most of the houses fell outward and not inward, andthose persons near the explosion describe their experience of theshock as falling asleep or going off in a trance.The society women of Johannesburg are doing noble work. Dr. Murraysays it is astonishing how intelligently alert and self-sacrificingthey are proving themselves to be. A story has been told me of a Boerwoman who was fearfully mangled; she bore the necessary surgicaloperation with fortitude, but wept copiously when a green baizepetticoat, which she had recently made out of a tablecloth, was takenoff. Only a solemn promise from Mrs. Joel, her lady nurse, to keep thegarment safe until her recovery, appeased her outcries.I asked the officer in charge yesterday if I might see some of myfriends who called, the sentinels having thus far denied thementrance. 'Yes, but there are some women in the place whom I do notcare to have come here.' 'And who might they be?' I asked. 'The wivesof the Reformers,' he answered. 'Then,' I flashed out, 'I do not careto accept _any_ favours at your hands; those women are my personalfriends, and the only persons under existing circumstances whom I wishto see.'(We were under this gentleman's surveillance for some time, and heafterwards proved very friendly, _so my husband says_, but I neverspoke to him again. I did not like him. His voice was unpleasant andhe had a high, hard nose, and I do not fancy people with hard, highnoses.)A poor little two-year-old baby was found wandering among the ruins atFordsburg, with only a slight scratch on her wrist. It is supposedthat she has been lying unconscious under the debris.A Malay woman was discovered cowering over the ruins of what was onceher home, crooning to a dead child at her breast.The Netherlands Railroad Company, _under whose auspices_ the accidenttook place, have donated 50,000 dollars to the Relief Fund; and theTransvaal Government has set aside 125,000 dollars for the samepurpose; the Uitlanders, 325,000 dollars, which was collected within afew hours after the explosion.FEBRUARY 25.--Business continues stagnant.A deputation of mining men go to Pretoria in regard to the depressionin the mining industry resulting from the imprisonment of the leaders.I hear many of the mines will have to shut down.England's Queen and President Kruger have exchanged messages over theexplosion.A Kaffir has been found in the wrecked station at Fordsburg; althoughhe had been imprisoned five days in the debris, he was still alive,and revived promptly after being given food. (He succumbed however,some days later to pneumonia brought on by the exposure).1,500 of the survivors from the dynamite disaster are now encamped atthe Agricultural Show Yard. The Relief Committee are doing allpossible to assuage their sufferings. Poor people! many of them areutterly crushed, and sit about dazed and listless; while the littlechildren, unconscious of the despair surrounding them, frolic aboutwith the chickens, and make mud-pies as if nothing had happened. Butfor the thoughtless elasticity of childhood, how few of us could liveto grow up!VIIIThe preliminary trial dragged its undignified course through theCourts with a fortnight's interruption, because a youth namedShumacher refused to give his opinions on a certain subject to theAttorney-General, and was committed to prison for contempt.The High Commissioner was going through genuflexions before the BoerPresident. Peace, peace, at any price! at the cost of broken promises,humiliating compromises, and the lives of sixty-four Reformers, ifneed be.[8]Mr. Chamberlain had caught the infection, and was salaaming across theworld to Mr. Kruger, like a marionette out of a box. Thoughtful peoplebegan to wonder if he were swung by a heavy weight, which was unknownto us. Sir William Harcourt was giving the House of Commons, inEngland, ill-founded and flippant assurances that 'the Uitlandersdesired no interference from the outside, whether British or other,but preferred rather to work out their own salvation.' He added manyunpleasant remarks about the Reformers. I said to one of hiscountrymen, 'Why does he, in his safety, flourish about, pinning usdeeper down in the wreckage?''Don't let that distress you. Everybody understands that he belongs tothe other party. If he were of the party in power he would be howlingfor the Reformers. Remember, Mrs. Hammond, that our system of partypolitics seems to call for such attitudes of injustice.' I didn'tquite understand the argument, but the gentleman spoke withconviction, and I was willing to accept his proffered comfort.In our quiet home at Park Town we had settled down to domesticroutine. The guard had gone to housekeeping in a tent under thedining-room window. They had made friends with Totsey, and then withTotsey's master, little Jack. Although I never recognised them beyonda formal bow, in answer to their salute as we drove in and out of thegrounds, I realised that they were kind-hearted men. They wereBurghers belonging to the Volunteer Corps, and were quite a differentgrade altogether from the men who composed our guard at Pretoria. Atfirst we had thirteen, then the number was diminished to nine. Eachman was paid 5.00 a day out of my good man's pocket, fed, and cabfare provided (to fetch and carry the relief squad from and to thetown).It was very like boiling a kid in its mother's milk, but I had thegratification of remarking once or twice with casual superiorityduring conjugal conversation, that revolutions were expensive things,and that was _some_ comfort.My invalid's health, which at first showed a decided change for thebetter, began to wane again. Massage was tried, and tonics were freelyadministered. Dr. Murray and I thought of Cape Town and the sea; but Imust own up, it was _the officer in charge_ who was most influentialin obtaining a permit for my husband to leave the Transvaal. The bailbond was increased to a hundred thousand dollars. Fearing _somebody_might change his mind, I insisted on Dr. Murray's starting at oncewith my husband for the Cape. Jacky was thrown in as a bonus. Parkerand I were to follow on the mail train two days later.The guard, who were by this time genuinely attached to their charge,begged him to be photographed in a group with themselves. To theirgreat pride this was done. I missed my husband just before hisdeparture, and Jacky, joining in my search from room to room, gavethe information, 'Papa is playing with his guard outside.' Weak thoughhe was, he had crawled out to the tent, with a big bottle ofchampagne, and when I stepped to the study window I saw, in the paletwilight, Mr. Hammond standing with the men about him. They liftedtheir glasses to him, and their hearty cheers shook me through.The travellers were despatched, and, according to our plan, I followedwith the maid. My dear husband was well enough to meet us in Cape Townat the depot, and Jacky was in high feather--he had a tin steamboat;he was inclined to swagger; and showed a personal complacency notwarranted by his appearance, for some of his clothes were put on withgreat care, _hind-part before_.We found lodgment at Muizenburg, near Cape Town--sun, wind, andprimitive discomfort, this last mitigated by the never-failingkindness of the proprietor. His little children fell over one anotherin eager service to my invalid; they were always sure of appreciativerecognition from him, and every child is sensitive to kindness.Mr. Joseph Story Curtis, the Reformer, joined us, brought down fromthe Rand by his physician and sick nurse; he was suffering frompartial paralysis, induced by the excitement of the revolution andpreliminary trial.Young Shumacher had come to the coast for building up, also Mr. VanGoenert, who had carried a gun on duty when Johannesburg was underarms. We were a saddened little circle at Muizenburg, and we used towatch the great ships sail out for 'home' with a lump in our throats.The strong salt breeze buoyed us up to fresh hope. A new friend cameto me: a woman with all a woman's tenderness, and the simplenecessities of life had a fresh meaning when supplied by you, dearJessie Rose Innes!Dr. Murray was obliged to leave us.An untimely sea-bath brought back most serious symptoms to mypatient, and I was the prey every afternoon to a low fever whichsapped my strength. Although at first this fever bore a horriblemenace, it proved a disguised blessing. For two or three hours eachday I was absolutely free of care, and would lie with quick pulse andmildly intoxicated brain dreaming I was with my elder boy on theborder of England. I saw him in his little Eton jacket and broadturned-down collar, his sweet young face fresh as the morning. Or Iwould dream of the pretty home under the hill, in far-off California.The fragrance of thick beds of violets would seem to float to me overthe long waste of sea, and I could see the tall roses nodding in thewhite summer fog. My temples beat like the winter rain on the roof,and the light before my eyes was the library fire, picking out, in itsold familiar way, the gilt lettering on the books ranged about. It wassweet to go back to all this, even down the scorching path of fever.Our stay at Cape Town was coming to its close.The first trial was called for April 24, and my husband insisted upongoing back to meet his sentence. Drs. Thomas and Scholtz declared thismost unadvisable. His heart was in such condition, any shock mightprove fatal. Their reports were forwarded to the Transvaal Government,and I begged for a few days' reprieve, cabling my urgent request toMr. Olney in Washington, Dr. Coster at Pretoria, and our faithfulfriend, Mr. Robert Chapin, United States Consul at Johannesburg. Mr.Olney _at once_ petitioned the Boer Government in our behalf. Dr.Coster answered curtly by wiring Mr. Chapin that John Hays Hammond wassummoned to appear before the High Court of the Transvaal on themorning of April 24, at 10 o'clock. To me he vouchsafed no word.Letters came from friends in Johannesburg begging my husband not toreturn, and cables from the United States to the same effect. Thesentence was sure to be a death sentence or a term of longimprisonment.From important sources, which for obvious reasons I cannot quote, Ireceived private messages and letters informing of a plan on foot tolynch the leaders. The beam from which four Boers had been hung yearsbefore at Schlaagter's Nek (Oh! that poisonous suggestion in the'Volksstem') had already been brought from the Colony for this specialpurpose. Mr. Manion, the Consular Agent, and Mr. K.B. Brown, anAmerican just arrived in Cape Town from the Rand, took me aside andlaid the case in all its bare brutality before me. _To allow myhusband to return to Pretoria was for him to meet certain death_. Ifhe were not lynched by the excited Boers, he was sure to get a deathsentence. Mr. Brown showed feeling as he plead with me to use a wife'sinfluence to save her husband's life. My head was swimming. I couldonly repeat in a dull, dogged way: 'He says his honour takes himback. He is the father of my sons, and I'd rather see him dead thandishonoured.'Somehow I got to my room, and the page-boy stumbled over me at thedoor some time afterward, and ran for Mrs. Cavanagh. When I felt alittle recovered, I put on my hat, and, not waiting for my husband'sreturn from an appointment with Dr. Thomas, I drove to the office ofMr. Rose Innes. He was not in, and his clerk declared he did not knowwhen he would be in. 'Very well, then; I'll wait until he does comein.'I was given a comfortable chair, and a dictionary was dusted andplaced under my feet. Mr. Rose Innes at length appeared. He wasgreatly astonished to find me waiting for him. I began abruptly: 'DearMr. Innes, I am in need of a friend; my distress is so great that Ican no longer distinguish right from wrong.' I told him everything;showed him the letters which I had received, and, facing him, asked,'What is my duty? I can appeal to my husband--for my sake, to savethe life of our child--and perhaps dissuade him! _My God, it is atemptation!_'Mr. Rose Innes sat deep in thought.'If you think his going back is a needless throwing away of a valuablelife,' I began, with a timid hope beginning to grow in my heart--'Iwill chloroform him and have him taken to sea!'Mr. Rose Innes leaned forward, and took my hand gently between hisown: 'Mrs. Hammond, your husband is doing the right thing in goingback; don't try to dissuade him. If he were my own brother I would saythe same'--and I accepted his decision.For a further strong but ineffectual effort to gain a few days' longerleave of absence for Mr. Hammond, I am indebted to this good friend.Also for many personal kindnesses which I can never forget. MissLouisa Rhodes was a most helpful friend as well; the anxiety incommon brought us very close together. She was a veritablefairy-godmother, bringing us wines and dainty food from GrooteSchuur's well-stocked larder to tempt us to eat.FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 8: Cablegram of the High Commissioner to Mr. Chamberlain,January 8, 1896:--'I intend, if I find that the Johannesburg people have substantiallycomplied with the Ultimatum, to insist on the fulfilment of promisesas regards prisoners and consideration of grievances, and will notallow, at this stage, the introduction of any fresh conditions asregards the London Convention of 1884. Do you approve?']IXAt Cape Town I saw the High Commissioner--a gentle old man withdelicate hands. He had lived two-thirds of his life, and passed thevirile period.The responsibility of taking my husband to Pretoria was more than Icould assume alone; my strength was nearly spent. Doctors Thomas andScholtz assisted me in every way. Although called separately, and notin consultation, these two gentlemen were far too broad-minded andgenerously interested in our welfare to stand upon professionaletiquette. Dr. Scholtz accepted the post of medical attendant on thejourney up-country, and one of the last faces which I saw at Cape Townas our train drew out was that of Dr. Thomas, who had left a criticalcase to hurry down in order to wish us God-speed.Jessie Rose Innes had come too, wild night though it was. Under hertweed cape she had brought from her home at Rondebosch a basket filledwith food--fresh butter, chicken jelly, extract of coffee, and ahome-made cake for 'Jacky boy.' Dear heart of gold! there was no needof words between us that sorrowful night.Trotting along beside the slowly-moving train, Sir James Sivewrightheld my hands thrust through the open window.'When the worst comes, you'll do all you can to help us, Sir James?' Iasked.'Indeed I will,' was the hearty response.The trip was a wearisome one. The weather was hot, and there was muchdust. Little Jack was the leaven of our heavy days, and a sweetletter, tucked away in a safe place, from the boy in England, wrungand cheered my aching heart. It bade us to 'brace up.' He had heardall about the troubles, and was glad his father was not idle when menwere needed. His house had won the football match. There were only afew more weeks to wait, and we would all be together again! Fatecarried a smile in her pocket for me so long as that boy kept well!At night we reached Vereenigen, on the border of the Transvaal. Wewere delayed there two hours (120 minutes, 7,200 seconds) while theCustom House officials examined the luggage. Faint and exhausted, myhusband lay on the seat before me. I sat at the open windowwaiting--waiting with every nerve strained and a fearful rushing soundin my ears, for the possible attack of excited Boers or a stray shotfrom some fanatic's rifle. Jacky, trying to clamber over my lap, wouldwhimper under the fierce clutch of my fingers as I dragged him downfrom the window.As is usual, the passengers' names had been telegraphed ahead, and acrowd of Boers had gathered at the station to see the man who had comeback to get his sentence. They were a wild, uncouth-looking crowdfrom the adjacent farms. I could hear them ask, 'Where is he?' 'Inthere,' another would answer, pointing with his thumb over hisshoulder to our compartment. In threes and fours they would shuffleinto our car and gaze with dull, stupid curiosity upon the prostrateman, as sheep gaze at a dead member of the flock. Dr. Scholtz,keen-eyed and watchful, stood on guard in the doorway. Platinum wouldhave melted under the courteous warmth of his manner to the officials.Our train at last under way, I found some one had thrust a bunch offresh grapes into my little boy's hand.Nearing Johannesburg Dr. Scholtz came to me: 'Your husband isexhausted. I think it best for him to pass the night at his home,going to Pretoria on the mid-day train to-morrow.'It was well we did this, for between Johannesburg and Pretoria thistrain met with one of the collisions so frequent on the NetherlandsRailway. Only the engineer and a brakeman were killed, but the shockwould certainly have been most disastrous to us.SUNDAY, NOON, APRIL 26.--My husband with Dr. Scholtz started forPretoria. I was unable to leave my bed, but it was agreed that Bettyand I should follow on the early train of the morrow.The Reform trial which was begun on Friday, April 24, was resumed onMonday.Repeated wires from Mr. Hammond and Dr. Scholtz prevailed upon me toremain at my home to rest another day. 'It would probably be a longtrial.'XMy husband reached Pretoria Sunday evening, April 26. The informationthat we had received en route, regarding the pleas of guilty enteredby the imprisoned Reformers, was confirmed by his associates: theother three leaders, Messrs. Rhodes, Farrar, and Phillips, had entereda plea of guilty under count one of the indictment for high treason,the fifty-nine Reformers entering a like plea of guilty under thecount of lese-majeste. As conjectured by us when we heard of thisaction of the Reformers, the prisoners had received certain assurancesbefore making such pleas:_First_.--That they should not be tried under the comparativelyobsolete Roman Dutch Law, which punished the crime of treason withdeath; but they would be tried and punished under, and in accordancewith, the code laws of the Transvaal Republic, which imposed penaltiesof fine and imprisonment for the crime charged in the indictment._Second_.--The leaders were further assured that this action on theirpart would measurably mitigate the sentences of the other fifty-nineReformers.On Monday, the 27th, the Court reconvened in the market hall, the_imported_ Judge Gregorowsky occupying the bench.Mr. Hammond took his place with the three leaders, attended by hisphysician, Dr. Scholtz, who remained at his side during the entiretrial.After some preliminary matters were disposed of, Mr. Hammond, actuatedby the same influences that were brought to bear on his associates,entered a plea of guilty to count one of the indictment, and placedhis signature to the written statement which had been previouslysigned by Messrs. Rhodes, Phillips, and Farrar.This written paper was in substance as follows:--     That for a number of years the Uitlanders had earnestly and     peacefully sought relief for their grievances by the     constitutional right of petition. That what they asked was     only what was conceded to new-comers by every other South     African Government.     That petition after petition was placed before the     authorities--one bearing 40,000 signatures, asking     alleviation of their burdens and wrongs; that they could     never obtain a hearing, and that the provisions of law     already deemed obnoxious and unfair were being made more     stringent; and, realising that they would never be accorded     the rights they were entitled to receive, it was determined     to make a demonstration of force in support of their just     demands.     The statement then recites the coming of Jameson against     their express commands and understanding with him, and all     the subsequent acts of the Transvaal Government, the High     Commissioner, and De Wet, Her Majesty's Agent, which are     now matters of history.The paper concluded as follows:--     'We admit responsibility for the action taken by us. We     practically avowed it at the time of the negotiations with     the Government, when we were informed that the services of     the High Commissioner had been accepted with a view to a     peaceful settlement.     'We submit that we kept faith in every detail of the     arrangement. We did all that was humanly possible to protect     both the State and Dr. Jameson from the consequences of his     action; that we have committed no breach of the law which     was not known to the Government at the time; and that the     earnest consideration of our grievances was promised.     'We can now only put the bare facts before the Court, and     submit to the judgment that may be passed upon us.'After the examination of several witnesses and the introduction of thecelebrated cipher telegrams, the Court was adjourned for the day.TUESDAY, THE 28TH.--There was a vast concourse gathered at the MarketHall on this day of the trial. The chamber was crowded to its utmostlimit by anxious and interested listeners. Many ladies were present.His Lordship (the imported Judge) was late in ascending the bench,unnecessarily prolonging the suspense of the waiting crowd.The proceedings were commenced with every formality that could renderthem impressive. A large number of armed men were stationed at theentrance and about the Court-room. A prominent object in theCourt-room, one which immediately struck the eye of those entering, asthis was its first appearance during the trial, was a plain woodendock, low in front, high at the back, and large enough to hold fourmen.As in the preliminary examination, the Court proceedings wereconducted in the Dutch language, an unfamiliar tongue to a majorityof the accused.After the despatch of some minor matters, Mr. Wessels, counsel for thedefence, made his address to the Court, closing by reading the writtenstatement of the four leaders, and asking the clemency of the Court.He made no reference or protest to the tribunal as constituted--aCourt presided over by a Judge _not a_ citizen of the country whosesovereignty had been offended by the treasonable acts charged.Mr. Wessels was followed by the State Attorney, Dr. Coster, in abitter and vindictive speech.He demanded that the prisoners at the bar should be punished under the_Roman Dutch Law_, and that the four leaders should receive the_death_ penalty.This demand of the State Attorney was apparently a surprise to Mr.Wessels, for he sprung to his feet in an excited manner and protestedmost vigorously against the demand of Dr. Coster; his language andmanner were such as to impress many present that it was provoked by abreach of good faith.At the conclusion of the speech of the State Attorney, Gregorowsky(the imported Judge) summed up the case at length, and held that theprisoners were guilty of high treason as charged in the indictment,and that the Roman Dutch Law governed in such cases; and that thesentences imposed would be in accordance therewith.The Sheriff then with a loud voice commanded silence whilst thesentence of death was pronounced.A deep hush fell upon the Court-room--a profound, breathless silencethat became oppressive before the next official utterances disturbedit.'Lionel Phillips, George Farrar, Francis Rhodes, John Hays Hammond!'called the Registrar.In response these four were singled out from the rest of the prisonersand conducted to the new dock.It was the Registrar who again spoke.'Lionel Phillips, have you any legal reasons to urge why sentence ofdeath should not be passed upon you, according to law?''No,' was the response.This was followed by the sentence.In like manner, Farrar and Rhodes were interrogated and sentenced.Mr. Hammond was then called to his feet and the same formal questionasked.Although pale and weak from protracted illness, Mr. Hammond respondedin a firm voice to the Registrar's question.The Judge, then addressing the prisoner, said: 'John Hays Hammond, itis my painful duty to pass sentence of death upon you.'I am only applying the punishment which is meted out and laid downaccording to law, leaving it to his Honour the State President, andthe Executive Council, to show you any mercy which may lie in theirpower.'May the magnanimity shown by his Honour the State President, and thisGovernment, to the whole world, during the recent painful events bealso shown to you.'I have nothing to do with that, however.'I can only say, that in any other country you would not have a claimon their mercy. The sentence of the Court is, that you be taken fromthis place where you are now, and be conveyed to the jail at Pretoria,or any such other jail in this Republic as may be appointed by law, tobe kept there till a time and place of execution shall be appointed bylawful authority, that you be taken to the place of execution to bethere hanged by the neck till you are dead.'May Almighty God have mercy on your soul!'Whilst the sentences were being passed upon the four leaders theauditors were wrought up to the highest pitch; sobs were heard onevery side, tears were on many cheeks, and even stolid old Boers wereseen to weep. One man was carried from the room in a fit.The four Reform leaders, who had borne themselves during this tryingtime in a brave and fearless manner, then stepped out of the dockfirmly and unhesitatingly, and were taken to the Pretoria jail.The other fifty-nine prisoners were then called to the bar andsentenced each to pay a fine of ten thousand dollars, and to suffertwo years' imprisonment.Thus ended this remarkable trial, a judicial trial unprecedented inthe annals of jurisprudence.A mockery of justice and a travesty upon civilisation.[9]FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 9: The foregoing regarding the trial and sentence of theReformers is from information derived from eye-witnesses and the localPress.]XIBy a strange providence Betty and I missed the early train. I had notreckoned on the delay in dressing which sorrow and fatigue couldoccasion.The paper had announced that the sentence was to be given at noon.Though I had no intention of being present in the Court-room, I wishedto be within reach of my husband in case he should need me. We tookthe local train which left Johannesburg at 10.30.Our journey came to an end. I saw Mr. Rose Innes and Dr. Scholtz onthe platform.'Is it the death sentence?'Mr. Rose Innes, with both hands on my shoulders to keep me fromfalling, said 'Yes.'There were many other friends, I have since learned, who were there toreceive me. I have a hazy recollection of Mr. Barnato, goodkind-hearted 'Barney,' begging me 'not to fret'; that he had broughtmy husband to Africa and he meant to stand by him till he got out ofAfrica. Mrs. Clement and Betty remained beside me. The day was withouthours to me, a dry aching stretch of time; I had no tears to shed!At some time in the afternoon Mrs. Joel brought me a flower and a notefrom my husband, beseeching me to keep up a brave heart, and assuringme that he was all right and as comfortable as was possible under thecircumstances.After the death sentence had been pronounced and the Court dismissed,Mrs. Joel, with woman's thoughtfulness, put a flask of brandy in herpocket and started for the prison. In the confusion of receiving theprisoners she managed to slip in and went at once to the condemnedcell. Her visit was a God-send to the four unhappy men, who were muchworn by months of anxiety, ill-health, and this final strain of thedeath sentence. They were bearing up wonderfully well, she said.One of the lawyers came and sat at the end of my sofa. He burst intotears. 'We've been played! we've been played!' he exclaimed, withvehemence. Remembering how the lawyers for the Reformers had muddledeverything from the beginning of the trial, how they hadconscientiously and persistently walked into every trap laid for them,I sat upright to look squarely into his face. 'My God! when haven'tyou been played?'The effect of the death sentence on Johannesburg was extreme: allshops and the Stock Exchange were closed, and the flags of the townwere placed at half mast.This, from the 'Standard and Diggers' News'--a tribute from theenemy's paper--goes to my heart:--'One respects the probity of the man who, dangerously ill and totallyunfit for the hardship of a prison, preferred to take his stand in thedock, rather than sacrifice his self-respect by flight from Cape Town;Mr. Hammond has worthily upheld the reputation of a nation whichclaims its sons as men who "never run away."'It was decided by the Executive this same night to commute the deathsentence, but this was not communicated to the condemned men until thefollowing morning. The night of suspense passed under the eye of thedeath watch with a dim light burning was a needless cruelty; it madethe President's subsequent magnanimity more dramatic, but with that Inaturally felt no sympathy.I have often been asked since if I did not realise that the Boerswould never have _dared_ execute my husband? And many dear friends whowere thousands of miles away assure me now that they never had amoment's real apprehension for his safety. We however, who were inPretoria, at the time, a helpless handful in the power of a primitivepopulation of narrow experience, a people inflamed by long years ofracial feud and recent victory, were by no means so sure that allwould end well. Two prominent men, standing high in authority,confessed to me later that they were most anxious and fearful ofresults, although at the time their sustaining support helped to keepmy body and soul together. _The gallows was prepared, and the orderwas to hang the four victims simultaneously_.The night following the sentence, Mr. Chapin, the U.S. Consul, and hiswife came to me. They were then and for months afterwards as tenderand faithful as people of my own kindred. Mr. Chapin was tireless inhis efforts in behalf of the Americans in trouble, and the highpersonal regard in which he was held by the Boer, as well asUitlander, did much subsequently to ameliorate their circumstances.Mr. Chapin at once interviewed Mr. Wessels, chief advocate for theReformers--and he told me immediately after the interview the resultof their meeting. Mr. Wessels distinctly said that, although it wasnot put in writing, it was understood between the State Attorney andhimself 'as between man and man' that if the prisoners pleaded guiltyhe would not press for severe punishment. (Mr. Wessels has since, forreasons only known to himself, denied this both privately andpublicly.)APRIL 29.--The commutation was published. Mrs. George Farrar had comefrom Johannesburg, and together we went to see our husbands. Our visitwas limited to five minutes. We found the four men haggard, butapparently cheerful. The condemned cell had an earthen floor. It hadbeen newly whitewashed and reeked of antiseptics. Four canvasstretchers, a tin pail filled with water, and a dipper, furnished it.A negro murderer had been its last occupant. I sat on one of thecanvas cots with an arm around my husband and holding Colonel Rhodes'hand. Mrs. Farrar was sitting on the opposite cot, locked in herhusband's embrace. The guard came to order us out. Poor Mrs. Farrarlooked so frail and white, I put my arm about her to give her support.In the courtyard we stopped to speak to one of the Reformers. Theguard became furious, and, swinging his arms in a threatening manner,rushed at us with curses. We were driven violently out of the yardlike depredating dogs. Surely the sun never looked upon two women insadder case. She was just up from her confinement, and I was faradvanced in pregnancy.XIINo cable of political purport could be sent from Pretoria safe frommutilation. I therefore despatched Mr. Hammond's secretary to CapeTown with a message to the American press, reporting Mr. Wessels' pleafor the Reformers, the statement of the four leaders, and thesentence. I did this, believing that, if the American public fullyunderstood the circumstances of the case, popular sympathy would allowno stone to remain unturned to protect their unfortunate countrymanfrom so violent and unjust a sentence.Pretoria seethed with overwrought wives. In the prison the men weresuffering real hardship. The sanitary arrangements were shocking.Twenty-two Reformers were crowded into a room thirty feet by ten.This room had been hastily built of corrugated iron, and leaked atevery seam. Draughts were strong enough to blow the hair about theirtemples; the men slept on straw mattresses laid on the floor, andthere was scarcely room enough for a man to get out of bed withoutstepping on his neighbour. Rations of mealie pap--a coarse, insipidporridge--with a hunk of hard, dark-coloured bread were given to eachprisoner in tin pannikins--not particularly clean. At mid-day a littlegreasy soup and soup meat were added. This unsavoury fare caused manyof the Reformers to go hungry rather than eat it. Others ate it, buttheir stomach afterwards rejected it. They were locked in the cells at5 o'clock and without lights. Prison regulations were most strict atthis period.Mr. S., one of the Reformers, had the misfortune to have his teethdrawn a short while before the trial. A new set was completed the dayafter his incarceration, and although his friends used every effortto convince the jailers of the perfect harmlessness of these falseteeth, and explained Mr. S.'s painful predicament in being withoutthem when he had nothing but hard food to chew, they insisted uponconsidering them contraband, and would not allow them to pass. PoorMr. S. lived for three days on a half-tin of condensed milk, smuggledin by the wife of a fellow-prisoner. The world has never seen suchwholesale smuggling as was practised by these devoted women. Mrs.Solly Joel as she passed daily through the prison gate was a completebuttery. The crown of her hat was filled with cigars; suspended fromher waist, under her dainty summer silk skirt, hung a bottle of cream.Tied to her back by way of a bustle was a brace of duck, or a roastedfowl wrapped neatly in linen. She said this gave her a slightlyout-of-date appearance, but she did not mind that. Under her cape Mrs.Clement wore a good-sized Bologna sausage around her waist as a belt;this was in time adroitly removed by Mr. Clement. Another ladysupplied the prisoners with tins of sardines and beef essence, whichshe carried concealed in her stockings. Occasional vagaries on thepart of these affectionate wives were subsequently explained to thecomplete satisfaction of their captive lords. Mrs. Butters' coynessand refusal to be embraced because of the flask of coffee in her bosomis an instance of this. All this sounds very funny now, but it wasdesperately earnest work then. In time the stringent rules relaxed.The prisoners were allowed to buy their own food, and Mr. AdvocateSauer made the same arrangement with the Pretoria Club to supply foodfor the Reformers as had been done during their former imprisonment.Those were boom times for little Pretoria. Hotel-keepers and tradesmencoined money, and the cab-drivers were able to open an account withthe bank.Mrs. Lionel Phillips closed up her beautiful home in Johannesburg,sent her babies to her people at the Cape, and took permanent lodgingsin Pretoria. She was most faithful in her visits to the prison, andwas kind to the three room-mates of her husband in many ways.XIIIMy diary continues through May:FIRST WEEK.--Petitions in favour of the Reformers are being signed allover the country. All feeling against the Reform Committee has veeredround, and the strongest sympathy is now felt for them. Only theextreme of the Boer and Hollander factions chant the old story oftheir trying to subvert the Government--conniving with Jameson, andthen deserting him, &c., &c.Landdrost Schutte and Captain Shields quarrel over who shall havecharge of the jail. Apparently it is an appointment of honour, orlarge emolument.Gregorowski is publicly hooted on his return to Bloemfontein. I hearthat as soon as Gregorowski had pronounced the death sentence, JudgeMorice dashed from the Court-room and ran hatless through the streetsof Pretoria to withdraw Gregorowski's name, which had been put up atthe Club, at his request. This is a sample of the feeling amonghonourable men. Judge Morice is a Burgher and a prominent Judge of theTransvaal Court. The Jury of Burghers called for the final trial,which was never empanelled, were greatly surprised and affected by thefearful sentence--some of them wept like children. And they were thefirst to draw up a petition for commutation.Prisoners are still wearing their own clothes, although it is saidthat enough jumpers of prison sacking are waiting to breech the lot.They suffer severely from cold and dampness, the prison accommodationsoffering little or no protection from the weather. Many of them areill. There is talk of separating the Reformers and sending them tojail in various districts--Barberton, Rustenburg, and Lydenburg. Thisthreat causes much apprehension, for their one solace is beingtogether.Rumour of English troops gathering on the Border.President Kruger and the High Commissioner exchanging opinion over theuneasiness. Kruger calls out, 'I see Bugaboos in your front yard,' andSir Hercules responds, 'Oh no; that's our tame cat.'Petitions come in from the country districts of the Transvaal. FromDurban and Pietermaritzburg, with over a thousand signatures, fromLorenco Marques, a second from Durban, and one from the Orange FreeState, expressing sympathy and the hopes of President Steyn.Natal sends a petition signed by 4,000 Burghers.The sentences are commuted, but nobody knows to what.General Joubert is sent off with a ten days' leave of absence to takehis annual bath.Messrs. Rose Lines and Solomon visit the jail daily.SECOND WEEK.--In spite of hardships my dear husband's health improves.He vows the death sentence has cured him. From day to day we arepromised a final decision from the Executive, but matters are stilldrifting. Nothing will probably be done in this direction untilGeneral Joubert returns to Pretoria, as he is one of the members ofthe Executive Council. It is suggested to me by one of the Governmentcircle that a visit from me to Mr. Kruger would be timely. All which Iwished to say I would not be allowed to say, and just to pay anaimless visit seemed a foolish thing to do, and, being outspoken, Isaid so. A friend in whom I had implicit confidence advised me to goby all means. I was possibly being used as a political pivot. Aftersome delay I did go, splattering through the mud in a wheezy old cabbehind a splayfooted white horse driven by a hunchbacked negro boy.The interview lasted five minutes, and was perfectly meaningless. Isuppose it was meant to be that. Ten fathoms down under many otherthings I could see that Kruger had strong heart qualities. Educatedand morally matured, he would be one of those grand characters whomake epochs in the world's history. We shook hands at parting and wentout of each other's lives for ever.Mr. G. told me, as he helped me into the cab at the door, that Mr.Kruger had received a cable from America in my husband's behalf,signed by the Vice-President and a large number of the Senate andHouse of Representatives. This information opened my eyes. I now sawwhy a visit from me would be 'timely.'Within an hour news was cabled by _some one_ to all parts of thecivilised world that the wife of the American prisoner, John HaysHammond, had received audience of the President of the Transvaal. 'Theinterview was of long duration. What transpired was of a privatecharacter, but it is believed to be very hopeful and satisfactory.'THIRD WEEK.--Delays, shiftings, postponements, delays with excuses,and delays without excuses. Each day strong petitions sent in to theExecutive. A continual stream of disheartened wives and friends ontheir way to the Presidency, many going in the early dawn, as thePresident--an early riser and of simple habit--was known then to beeasy of access. A pitiful picture lingers in my mind of a dozenReformers' wives in the deep golden yellow of an African sunrisesitting on the edge of the broad side-walk with their feet in the dustwaiting for the President to return from burying a Landdrost's wife. Icannot remember that Mr. Kruger made any specific promises. 'All shallcome right,' he said frequently. 'Wait; don't hurry me. I must goslow, or my Burghers will get out of hand.' We waited, and the meninside of the prison walls one after another sickened and lost heart.On May 12, Dr. Messum sent the following report in to the Landdrost:--Dear Sir,--I have, on the 29th and 30th April, written to theInspector of Jails about the state of the jail. I do not know if I amto report to you or to the Inspector of Jails; in any case, I have thehonour again to report that as yet no alteration has been made in thesheds in which the political prisoners are kept. I must repeat againthat they are too small and unhealthy for the number of prisonersplaced in them. I find now, on account of their immediate vicinity tothe native section, that vermin is beginning to trouble the politicalprisoners. There are amongst the political prisoners very old andsickly men, whose lives, on account of the insufficient accommodation,are placed in danger. There is not yet any proper hospital room forthe sick, who are thus obliged to remain amongst the others. I findthat the accommodation is very insanitary and unhealthy.About the prisoner F. Gray I wish to make special mention, because heis showing signs of developing melancholia (lunacy), caused by theuncertainty of the future and what he has gone through during the lastfew months.I also fear that he later on will develop suicidal tendencies. I wouldrecommend that his sentence should be taken into immediateconsideration, and to discharge him at once from the jail.  I have the honour to be, etc.,        GORDON MESSUM, M.D.,            _District Surgeon_.Unfortunately this report was not considered, and on the 16th day ofMay poor Gray, distraught by his sufferings, cut his throat.Mr. Fred Gray was a man of high business standing. He was married, andthe father of six children. His tragic death was a shock to every one.Johannesburg turned out in a body ten thousand strong to carry hisremains to the burial-place. Inside the jail, his fellow prisoners hadformed in procession and with uncovered heads followed the body as faras the prison gates, the limit of their freedom, not a man with dryeyes._The first prisoner was liberated_.FOURTH WEEK.--The decision still withheld. President Kruger excusesthis by saying it is due to the fact that only half the captiveRandites have signed the petition for commuting the banishment andimprisonment clauses to fines.The suspense is heartbreaking, and night brings no forgetfulness.Those long voiceless nights of South Africa! Not a bird's call, nor achirp from the tiny creatures which hide in the grass. A white moon, awide heaven filled with strange stars, and the tall moon-flowers atthe gate lifting up their mute white trumpets to the night wind.The little boy beside me rouses from his sleep to ask:--'Mother dear,why do you laugh and shake the bed so?'Fearing an illness, I yearned for a last interview with my husband. Itwas a Saturday that I went to Pretoria, and although the prison wassupposed to be closed on that day to visitors, I had several timesgained admittance through the kindness of those in authority. I wentto the Landdrost who had the dispensing of permits.'Will you please make an exception in my favour and allow me to see myhusband? I am ill, and must return to my home in Johannesburg atonce.''What does she say?' roared the Landdrost, who for some reason was ina furious temper. He turned to a Boer in the room. 'Tell her she maywhine as much as she pleases, she can't see her husband on Saturday._Nobody_ can go in the prison on Saturday. If she wants to see herhusband she must wait until next Monday!' The man turned fiercelytowards me, but seeing my patient face, or perhaps for the sake ofsome Boer woman on a distant farm, his voice broke, and became quitegentle as he delivered the message.With one exception this was the only time I ever received harshtreatment from a Boer official. Of course I sometimes met with a_strictness of manner_ which was to be expected, and which I was quiteprepared to submit to. Brutal unkindness I never experienced buttwice.Reaching the jail, whither I had directed the cabman to drive me, Ifound Advocate Sauer and Mr. Du Plessis standing at the gate. Theyalmost dropped at sight of my face. Dignity had deserted me. I wasactually howling in my distress,'Please, _please_ let me in to my husband!'Du Plessis, rough and violent as he was to most people, was alwayskind to me. He opened the wicket and pushed me gently through. Thatwas his answer. My sudden entrance, a ball of a woman with the tearsdripping down on to her breast, surprised the warders. They regardedme with stricken faces. One at last rallied. With his eyes stillfastened upon me, he called,'Mister H-a-m-mond, Mister H-a-m-mond, your missis is here!' and myhusband came rapidly across the yard.I went home to my bed. Dr. Murray came in charge.'Poor little woman! There is nothing to prescribe but oblivion in acase like this.' He ordered narcotics. Two weeks later I was told thatI had been dangerously ill. In that darkened room I had suspected myjeopardy. Surely there is a special place in heaven for mothers whodie unwillingly.From distant parts of the world kind letters came to me--and fromJohannesburg messages, sweet, with full-hearted sympathy--many ofthese from people whom I had never seen, nor ever shall in this life.I found friends in the days of my trouble, as precious as rare jewels,whom I shall wear on my heart until it stops its beating.The Government most generously allowed my husband to come to mybedside. He was accompanied by the chief jailer, Du Plessis. He woresome violets in his buttonhole, I remember, which the jailer's childhad given him. Mr. Du Plessis asked to see me. He had news to tell mewhich would cheer me up, he said. Brought to my bedside, all he couldsay, and he said it over and over again in his embarrassment, was:'Don't be unhappy; your husband won't be many years in prison.'This did not bring the cheer intended. Playing the part of guest wasirksome to Du Plessis. He went home to Pretoria the secondday--leaving Mr. Hammond, who was not on parole, or even under bail,entirely free. No point in my husband's career has ever given me soentire a sense of gratification as the confidence in his honour thusmanifested by the Boer Government. In my convalescence he returned toPretoria and gave himself up at the prison.'You might have waited another day,' said the warder in charge; 'wedon't need you yet.'XIVOne day the 'Star' (in a third edition) announced the great decisionwas at last concluded. The sixty-three Reformers were to be dividedinto four groups and sentenced in lots. Ten were to be liberatedbecause of ill-health. Some were to be imprisoned twelve months,others five, and still others three months. The four leaders weresentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment, which, if carried out, wasequivalent to death. However, this sentence was provisional, and itwas understood petitions would be entertained.This news was first taken into the jail by two wives who had outrunthe messenger. My husband says that when he saw Mrs. X. throw herselfweeping and speechless into her husband's arms, he thought 'it was allup with him.'X. wasn't half the offender he was, and the sentence was evidentlysomething too dreadful to tell. Mr. X. was one of the three months'men, I believe.These sentences, although unpopular, relieved to a certain extent theawful strain. But what was Johannesburg's wrath to hear two days laterthat the sentences were not for the periods mentioned, _but that atthe expiration of these periods the prisoners could make freshapplications to be again considered!_ This was juggling with humansouls! Everybody believed it to be the work of Dr. Leyds. A man moreexecrated than Dr. Leyds, I believe, does not live!Three more weeks of cruel suspense followed.Mr. Chamberlain continued to tumble down the Boer back stairs headover heels, yelling out excuses as he descended. He publicly denied onthe 29th that Great Britain had promised to protect the Reformers,and added that they were not being unfairly treated. I will never makestatesmen of my sons. I'd rather set them to ploughing.Mark Twain came to the Rand. He visited the men at Pretoria. Myhusband did the honours of the prison, and introduced him to theReformers. He talked a long while to them, sitting on a dry goods box.Expressed his satisfaction at finding only one journalist in thecrowd, and no surprise that the lawyers were largely represented. Heassured them that they were to be congratulated and envied, althoughthey did not know it. There was no place one was so safe frominterruption as in a jail. He recalled to their minds Cervantes andColumbus--it was an honour to share captivity with such men as these.They have sent another member of the Executive away to the baths, andlater his absence will be given as an excuse for delay.MAY 30.--All the Reformers with the exception of Davies and Sampson,and the four leaders, are released after paying ten thousand dollarseach, and giving their oath to abstain in future from discussing orparticipating in Transvaal politics.JUNE.--Meetings are called by the labourers on the Rand. They send amonster petition to Pretoria. The miners and mechanics also send apetition. The famous Innes petition is being circulated all over SouthAfrica, and the mayors of all the large towns are preparing to go in abody to Pretoria to present their petitions for the release of theleaders. The President promises and postpones from day to day. Theretention of the leaders is acknowledged to be only a question of theamount of fine.An influential deputation from the Cape Town branch of the AfricanderBond wait upon President Kruger, and a petition signed by sixtymembers of the Cape Parliament is read to him. Another deputationcomes from the Chamber of Commerce. The Mayor of Durban forwardsthrough the Colonial Secretary a petition bearing 1,250 names, and theKimberley branch of the Bond send a petition. Nothing comes of it all.The President appoints the 7th to be a day of humiliation and prayer,and Dr. Leyds doubles his bodyguard.JUNE 10.--The whole of South Africa is appealing to President Krugerto let the leaders free. The entire white population--two millions ofpeople--give voice to this desire and hope of United South Africa. Onehundred and fifty mayors, representing 200 towns and many of the ruraldistricts, are in Pretoria waiting for audience with the ExecutiveCouncil.This evening, Thursday, June 11, the leaders were given their libertyafter paying each a fine of 125,000 dollars, and taking an oath toabstain from taking part in the politics of the Transvaal. ColonelRhodes refused, being an English officer, to take the oath, and wasbanished, not to appear again in the Transvaal, under pain of death.The Executive then politely announced its decision to receive theMayoral delegates on _Saturday morning_ next. Perhaps the Mayors werenot mad! Some of these men had trekked for days in ox-wagons beforereaching the railroad to take train for Pretoria. A large banquet wasgiven in their honour. They insisted upon the liberated leaders beinginvited as guests--but those criminals, leaders, and instigators didnot attend, deeming it injudicious under the circumstances.My husband flew to me, who am still kept indoors. He came with a lightin his face I had not seen for months. 'We are free!'JUNE 12.--This is a gala day in Johannesburg. Everybody isjoyous--Kruger's name is cheered everywhere. Several thousand peoplewere at the station to receive the leaders. Messrs. Phillips andFarrar were the only two left of the four to step off the train. Theywere caught up shoulder-high and carried by the crowd. Cheers rent theair. The horses were unyoked from their victoria, and willing handsgrasped the shafts; and like returning conquerors, instead ofcriminals, these instigators were dragged triumphantly down the heartof the town followed by a vociferous multitude.As the invited guests of Cape Colony we travelled on a special trainto Cape Town--by 'we,' I mean a dozen or two Reformers with theirfamilies. The heartfelt ringing cheers as we pulled out of the stationI can never forget. The cheers again at Bloemfontein and the strangerswho came forward to shake hands and congratulate have enriched mylife. One man at a way station in the Free State rode up shouting:'Where is the American, John Hays Hammond?' My husband came forward.'Mr. Hammond, I have come miles from an ostrich farm to shake handswith you. You are a white man, and Americans are proud of you!'The Mayor of Cape Town received us, and dear friends were there totell us with brimming eyes of their joy in our release.XVThose good people who have followed me thus far will see that awoman's part in a revolution is a very poor part to play. There islittle hazard and no glory in it.The day we made Southampton, as we stood, a number of Reformers andReformers' wives, on the 'Norham's' deck, one of the gentlemen who hadcome to welcome us asked:'Mrs. Hammond, what did _you_ do in the revolution?''She helped us bear our trouble,' said Lionel Phillips, and his wordswere sweet praise to my ears.A few weeks later, in my lovely English home, a third son was born tous. There was something very appropriate in this child of war-timesbeing first consigned to the professional arms of a Miss Gunn.'He is perfect,' were his father's first words to me as he leaned overthe new-born infant, and every mother will know all that meant to me.

Le romann'est pas bien conduit. Il va souvent un peu a l'aventure, a-t-on dit;il manque de proportion. C'est l'opinion de mes amis, et je la croisfondee. Ce defaut, qui ne consiste pas dans un _decousu_, mais dans une_sinuosite_ exageree d'evenements, a ete l'effet de mon infirmiteordinaire: l'absence de plan. Je le corrige ordinairement beaucoup quandl'ouvrage, termine, est entier dans mes mains. Mais la grandeconsommation de livres nouveaux qui s'est faite de 1835 a 1845particulierement, la concurrence des journaux et des revues, l'aviditedes lecteurs, complice de celle des editeurs, ce furent la des causes deproduction rapide et de publication pour ainsi dire forcee, Jem'interessais vivement au succes de la _Revue independante_, fondee parmes amis Pierre Leroux et Louis Viardot, continuee par mes amisFerdinand Francois et Pernet. J'avais commence _Consuelo_ avec le projetde ne faire qu'une nouvelle. Ce commencement plut, et on m'engagea a ledevelopper, en me faisant pressentir tout ce que le dix-huitieme siecleoffrait d'interet sous le rapport de l'art, de la philosophie et dumerveilleux, trois elements produits par ce siecle d'une facontres-heterogene en apparence, et dont le lien etait cependant curieux etpiquant a etablir sans trop de fantaisie.Des lors, j'avancai dans mon sujet, au jour le jour, lisant beaucoup etproduisant aussitot, pour chaque numero de la _Revue_ (car on me priaitde ne pas m'interrompre), un fragment assez considerable.Je sentais bien que cette maniere de travailler n'etait pas normale etoffrait de grands dangers; ce n'etait pas la premiere fois que je m'yetais laisse entrainer; mais, dans un ouvrage d'aussi longue haleine etappuye sur tant de realites historiques, l'entreprise etait temeraire.La premiere condition d'un ouvrage d'art, c'est le temps et la liberte.Je parle ici de la liberte qui consiste a revenir sur ses pas quand ons'apercoit qu'on a quitte son chemin pour se jeter dans une traverse; jeparle du temps qu'il faudrait se reserver pour abandonner les sentiershasardeux et retrouver la ligne droite. L'absence de ces deux securites,cree a l'artiste une inquietude fievreuse, parfois favorable al'inspiration, parfois perilleuse pour la raison, qui, en somme, doitenchainer le caprice, quelque carriere qui lui soit donnee dans untravail de ce genre.Ma reflexion condamne donc beaucoup cette maniere de produire. Qu'ontravaille aussi vite qu'on voudra et qu'on pourra: _le temps ne faitrien a l'affaire_; mais entre la creation spontanee et la publication,il faudrait absolument le temps de relire l'ensemble et de l'expurgerdes longueurs qui sont precisement l'effet ordinaire de laprecipitation. La fievre est bonne, mais la conscience de l'artiste abesoin de passer en revue, a tete reposee, avant de les raconter touthaut, les songes qui ont charme sa divagation libre et solitaire.Je me suis donc presque toujours abstenue depuis d'agir avec cettecomplaisance mal entendue pour les autres et pour soi, et mes amis sesont apercus d'une seconde maniere, plus sobre et mieux digeree, dont jem'etais fait la promesse a moi-meme, en courant a travers champs apresla voyageuse _Consuelo_. Je sentais la un beau sujet, des typespuissants, une epoque et des pays semes d'accidents historiques, dont lecote intime etait precieux a explorer; et j'avais regret de ne pouvoirreprendre mon itineraire et choisir mes etapes, a mesure que j'avancaisau hasard, toujours frappee et tentee par des horizons nouveaux.Il y a dans _Consuelo_ et dans _La Comtesse de Rudolstadt_, desmateriaux pour trois ou quatre bons romans. Le defaut, c'est d'avoirentasse trop de richesses brutes dans un seul. Ces richesses me venaienta foison dans les lectures dont j'accompagnais mon travail. Il y avaitla plus d'une mine a explorer, et je ne pouvais resister au desir depuiser un peu dans chacune, au risque de ne pas classer bien sagementmes conquetes.Tel qu'il est, l'ouvrage a de l'interet et, contre ma coutume quand ils'agit de mes ouvrages, j'en conseille la lecture. On y apprendrabeaucoup de choses qui ne sont pas nouvelles pour les gens instruits,mais qui, par leur rapprochement, jettent une certaine lumiere sur lespreoccupations et, par consequent, sur l'esprit du siecle deMarie-Therese et de Frederic II, de Voltaire et de Cagliostro: siecleetrange, qui commence par des chansons, se developpe dans desconspirations bizarres, et aboutit, par des idees profondes, a desrevolutions formidables!Que l'on fasse bon marche de l'intrigue et de l'invraisemblance decertaines situations; que l'on regarde autour de ces gens et de cesaventures de ma fantaisie, on verra un monde ou je n'ai rien invente, unmonde qui existe et qui a ete beaucoup plus fantastique que mespersonnages et leurs vicissitudes: de sorte que je pourrais dire que cequ'il y a de plus impossible dans mon livre, est precisement ce quis'est passe dans la realite des choses.GEORGE SAND.Nohant, 15 septembre 1854.CONSUELOI."Oui, oui, Mesdemoiselles, hochez la tete tant qu'il vous plaira; laplus sage et la meilleure d'entre vous, c'est ... Mais je ne veux pas ledire; car c'est la seule de ma classe qui ait de la modestie, et jecraindrais, en la nommant, de lui faire perdre a l'instant meme cetterare vertu que je vous souhaite....--_In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritu Sancto_, chanta la Costanzad'un air effronte.--_Amen_, chanterent en choeur toutes les autres petites filles.--Vilain mechant! dit la Clorinda en faisant une jolie moue, et endonnant un petit coup du manche de son eventail sur les doigts osseux etrides que le maitre de chant laissait dormir allonges sur le claviermuet de l'orgue.--A d'autres! dit le vieux professeur, de l'air profondement desabused'un homme qui, depuis quarante ans, affronte six heures par jour toutesles agaceries et toutes les mutineries de plusieurs generationsd'enfants femelles. Il n'en est pas moins vrai, ajouta-t-il en mettantses lunettes dans leur etui et sa tabatiere dans sa poche, sans leverles yeux sur l'essaim railleur et courrouce, que cette sage, cettedocile, cette studieuse, cette attentive, cette bonne enfant, ce n'estpas vous, signora Clorinda; ni vous, signora Costanza; ni vous non plus,signora Zulietta; et la Rosina pas davantage, et Michela encoremoins....--En ce cas, c'est moi ...--Non, c'est moi ...--Pas du tout, c'estmoi?--Moi!--Moi!" s'ecrierent de leurs voix flutees ou percantes unecinquantaine de blondines ou de brunettes, en se precipitant comme unevolee de mouettes crieuses sur un pauvre coquillage laisse a sec sur lagreve par le retrait du flot.Le coquillage, c'est-a-dire le maestro (et je soutiens qu'aucunemetaphore ne pouvait etre mieux appropriee a ses mouvements anguleux, ases yeux nacres, a ses pommettes tachetees de rouge, et surtout auxmille petites boucles blanches, raides et pointues de la perruqueprofessorale); le maestro, dis-je, force par trois fois de retomber surla banquette apres s'etre leve pour partir, mais calme et impassiblecomme un coquillage berce et endurci dans les tempetes, se fit longtempsprier pour dire laquelle de ses eleves meritait les eloges dont il etaittoujours si avare, et dont il venait de se montrer si prodigue. Enfin,cedant comme a regret a des prieres que provoquait sa malice, il prit lebaton doctoral dont il avait coutume de marquer la mesure, et s'enservit pour separer et resserrer sur deux files son troupeauindiscipline. Puis avancant d'un air grave entre cette double haie detetes legeres, il alla se poser dans le fond de la tribune de l'orgue,en face d'une petite personne accroupie sur un gradin. Elle, les coudessur ses genoux, les doigts dans ses oreilles pour n'etre pas distraitepar le bruit, etudiait sa lecon a demi-voix pour n'etre incommode apersonne, tortillee et repliee sur elle-meme comme un petit singe; lui,solennel et triomphant, le jarret et le bras tendus, semblable au bergerParis adjugeant la pomme, non a la plus belle, mais a la plus sage."_Consuelo?_ l'Espagnole?" s'ecrierent tout d'une voix les jeuneschoristes, d'abord frappees de surprise. Puis un eclat de rireuniversel, homerique, fit monter enfin le rouge de l'indignation et dela colere au front majestueux du professeur.La petite Consuelo, dont les oreilles bouchees n'avaient rien entendu detout ce dialogue, et dont les yeux distraits erraient au hasard sansrien voir, tant elle etait absorbee par son travail, demeura quelquesinstants insensible a tout ce tapage. Puis enfin, s'apercevant del'attention dont elle etait l'objet, elle laissa tomber ses mains de sesoreilles sur ses genoux, et son cahier de ses genoux a terre; elle restaainsi petrifiee d'etonnement, non confuse, mais un peu effrayee, etfinit par se lever pour regarder derriere elle si quelque objet bizarreou quelque personnage ridicule n'etait point, au lieu d'elle, la causede cette bruyante gaite."Consuelo, lui dit le maestro en la prenant par la main sans s'expliquerdavantage, viens la, ma bonne fille, chante-moi le _Salve Regina_ dePergolese, que tu apprends depuis quinze jours, et que la Clorindaetudie depuis un an."Consuelo, sans rien repondre, sans montrer ni crainte, ni orgueil, niembarras, suivit le maitre de chant jusqu'a l'orgue, ou il se rassit et,d'un air de triomphe, donna le ton a la jeune eleve. Alors Consuelo,avec simplicite et avec aisance, eleva purement, sous les profondesvoutes de la cathedrale, les accents de la plus belle voix qui les eutjamais fait retentir. Elle chanta le _Salve Regina_ sans faire une seulefaute de memoire, sans hasarder un son qui ne fut completement juste,plein, soutenu ou brise a propos; et suivant avec une exactitude toutepassive les instructions que le savant maitre lui avait donnees, rendantavec ses facultes puissantes les intentions intelligentes et droites dubonhomme, elle fit, avec l'inexperience et l'insouciance d'un enfant, ceque la science, l'habitude et l'enthousiasme n'eussent pas fait faire aun chanteur consomme: elle chanta avec perfection. "C'est bien, mafille, lui dit le vieux maitre toujours sobre de compliments. Tu asetudie avec attention, et tu as chante avec conscience. La prochainefois tu me repeteras la cantate de Scarlati que je t'ai enseignee.--_Si, Signor professore_, repondit Consuelo. A present je puis m'enaller?--Oui, mon enfant. Mesdemoiselles, la lecon est finie."Consuelo mit dans un petit panier ses cahiers, ses crayons, et son petiteventail de papier noir, inseparable jouet de l'Espagnole aussi bien quede la Venitienne, et dont elle ne se servait presque jamais, bienqu'elle l'eut toujours aupres d'elle. Puis elle disparut derriere lestuyaux de l'orgue, descendit ave la legerete d'une souris l'escaliermysterieux qui ramene a l'eglise, s'agenouilla un instant en traversantla nef du milieu, et, au moment de sortir, trouva aupres du benitier unbeau jeune seigneur qui lui tendit le goupillon en souriant. Elle enprit; et, tout en le regardant droit au visage avec l'aplomb d'unepetite fille qui ne se croit point et ne se sent point encore femme,elle mela son signe de croix et son remerciment d'une si plaisantefacon, que le jeune seigneur se prit a rire tout a fait. Consuelo se mita rire aussi; et tout a coup, comme si elle se fut rappele qu'onl'attendait, elle prit sa course, et franchit le seuil de l'eglise, lesdegres et le portique en un clin d'oeil.Cependant le professeur remettait pour la seconde fois ses lunettes dansla vaste poche de son gilet, et s'adressant aux ecolieres silencieuses:"Honte a vous! mes belles demoiselles, leur disait-il. Cette petitefille, la plus jeune d'entre vous, la plus nouvelle dans ma classe, estseule capable de chanter proprement un solo; et dans les choeurs,quelque sottise que vous fassiez autour d'elle, je la retrouve toujoursaussi ferme et aussi juste qu'une note de clavecin. C'est qu'elle a duzele, de la patience, et ce que vous n'avez pas et que vous n'aurezjamais, toutes tant que vous etes, _de la conscience!_--Ah! voila son grand mot lache! s'ecria la Costanza des qu'il futsorti. Il ne l'avait dit que trente-neuf fois durant la lecon, et ilferait une maladie s'il n'arrivait a la quarantieme.--Belle merveille que cette Consuelo fasse des progres! dit la Zulietta.Elle est si pauvre! elle ne songe qu'a se depecher d'apprendre quelquechose pour aller gagner son pain.--On m'a dit que sa mere etait une Bohemienne, ajouta la Michelina, etque la petite a chante dans les rues et sur les chemins avant de venirici. On ne saurait nier qu'elle a une belle voix; mais elle n'a pasl'ombre d'intelligence, cette pauvre enfant! Elle apprend par coeur,elle suit servilement les indications du professeur, et puis ses bonspoumons font le reste.--Qu'elle ait les meilleurs poumons et la plus grande intelligencepar-dessus le marche, dit la belle Clorinda, je ne voudrais pas luidisputer ces avantages s'il me fallait echanger ma figure contre lasienne.--Vous n'y perdriez deja pas tant! reprit Costanza, qui ne mettait pasbeaucoup d'entrainement a reconnaitre la beaute de Clorinda.--Elle n'est pas belle non plus, dit une autre. Elle est jaune comme uncierge pascal, et ses grands yeux disent rien du tout; et puis toujourssi mal habillee. Decidement c'est une laideron.--Pauvre fille! c'est bien malheureux pour elle, tout cela: pointd'argent, et point de beaute!"C'est ainsi qu'elles terminerent le panegyrique de Consuelo, et qu'ellesse consolerent en la plaignant, de l'avoir admiree tandis qu'ellechantait.II.Ceci se passait a Venise il y a environ une centaine d'annees, dansl'eglise des _Mendicanti_, ou le celebre maestro Porpora venaitd'essayer la repetition de ses grandes vepres en musique, qu'il devait ydiriger le dimanche suivant, jour de l'Assomption. Les jeunes choristesqu'il avait si vertement gourmandees etaient des enfants de ces_scuole_, ou elles etaient instruites aux frais de l'Etat, pour etre parlui dotees ensuite, _soit pour le mariage, soit pour le cloitre_, ditJean-Jacques Rousseau, qui admira leurs voix magnifiques vers la memeepoque, dans cette meme eglise. Lecteur, tu ne te rappelles que trop cesdetails, et un episode charmant raconte par lui a ce propos dans lelivre VIII des _Confessions_. Je n'aurai garde de transcrire ici cesadorables pages, apres lesquelles tu ne pourrais certainement pas teresoudre a reprendre les miennes; et bien autant ferais-je a ta place,ami lecteur. J'espere donc que tu n'as pas en ce moment les_Confessions_ sous la main, et je poursuis mon conte.Toutes ces jeunes personnes n'etaient pas egalement pauvres, et il estbien certain que, malgre la grande integrite de l'administration,quelques-unes se glissaient la, pour lesquelles c'etait plutot unespeculation qu'une necessite de recevoir, aux frais de la Republique,une education d'artiste et des moyens d'etablissement. C'est pourquoiquelques-unes se permettaient d'oublier les saintes lois de l'egalite;grace auxquelles on les avait laissees s'asseoir furtivement sur lesmemes bancs que leurs pauvres soeurs. Toutes aussi ne remplissaient pasles vues austeres que la Republique avait sur leur sort futur. Il s'endetachait bien quelqu'une de temps en temps, qui, ayant profite del'education gratuite, renoncait a la dot pour chercher ailleurs une plusbrillante fortune. L'administration, voyant que cela etait inevitable,avait quelquefois admis aux cours de musique les enfants des pauvresartistes dont l'existence nomade ne permettait pas un bien long sejour aVenise. De ce nombre etait la petite Consuelo, nee en Espagne, etarrivee de la en Italie en passant par Saint-Petersbourg,Constantinople, Mexico, ou Arkangel, ou par toute autre route encoreplus directe a l'usage des seuls Bohemiens.Bohemienne, elle ne l'etait pourtant que de profession et par maniere dedire; car de race, elle n'etait ni Gitana ni Indoue, non plusqu'Israelite en aucune facon. Elle etait de bon sang espagnol, sansdoute mauresque a l'origine, car elle etait passablement brune, et toutesa personne avait une tranquillite qui n'annoncait rien des racesvagabondes. Ce n'est point que de ces races-la je veuille medire. Sij'avais invente le personnage de Consuelo, je ne pretends point que jene l'eusse fait sortir d'Israel, ou de plus loin encore; mais elle etaitformee de la cote d'Ismael, tout le revelait, dans son organisation. Jene l'ai point vue, car je n'ai pas encore cent ans, mais on me l'aaffirme, et je n'y puis contredire. Elle n'avait pas cette petulancefebrile interrompue par des acces de langueur apathique qui distingueles _zingarelle_. Elle n'avait pas la curiosite insinuante et lamendicite tenace d'une _ebbrea_ indigente. Elle etait aussi calme quel'eau des lagunes, et en meme temps aussi active que les gondoleslegeres qui en sillonnent incessamment la face.Comme elle grandissait beaucoup, et que sa mere etait fort miserable,elle portait toujours ses robes trop courtes d'une annee; ce qui donnaita ses longues jambes de quatorze ans, habituees a se montrer en public,une sorte de grace sauvage et d'allure franche qui faisait plaisir etpitie a voir. Si son pied etait petit, on ne le pouvait dire, tant iletait mal chausse. Eh revanche; sa taille, prise dans des _corps_devenus trop etroits et craques a toutes les coutures, etait svelte etflexible comme un palmier, mais sans forme, sans rondeur, sans aucuneseduction. La pauvre fille n'y songeait guere, habituee qu'elle etait as'entendre traiter de _guenon_, de _cedrat_, et de _moricaude_, par lesblondes, blanches et repletes filles de l'Adriatique. Son visage toutrond, bleme et insignifiant, n'eut frappe personne, si ses cheveuxcourts, epais et rejetes derriere ses oreilles, en meme temps que sonair serieux et indifferent a toutes les choses exterieures, ne luieussent donne une certaine singularite peu agreable. Les figures qui neplaisent pas perdent de plus en plus la faculte de plaire. L'etre quiles porte, indifferent aux autres, le devient a lui-meme, et prend unenegligence de physionomie qui eloigne de plus en plus les regards. Labeaute s'observe, s'arrange, se soutient, se contemple, et se pose pourainsi dire sans cesse dans un miroir imaginaire place devant elle. Lalaideur s'oublie et se laisse aller. Cependant il en est de deux sortes:l'une qui souffre et proteste sans cesse contre la reprobation generalepar une habitude de rage et d'envie: ceci est la vraie, la seulelaideur; l'autre, ingenue, insouciante, qui prend son parti, qui n'eviteet ne provoque aucun jugement, et qui gagne le coeur tout en choquantles yeux: c'etait la laideur de Consuelo. Les personnes genereuses quis'interessaient a elle regrettaient d'abord qu'elle ne fut pas jolie; etpuis, se ravisant, elles disaient, en lui prenant la tete avec cettefamiliarite qu'on n'a pas pour la beaute: "Eh bien, toi, tu as la mined'une bonne creature"; et Consuelo etait fort contente, bien qu'ellen'ignorat point que cela voulait dire: "Tu n'as rien de plus."Cependant le jeune et beau seigneur qui lui avait offert de l'eau beniteresta aupres de la coupe lustrale, jusqu'a ce qu'il eut vu defiler l'uneapres l'autre jusqu'a la derniere des _scolari_. Il les regarda toutesavec attention, et lorsque la plus belle, la Clorinda, passa pres delui, il lui donna l'eau benite avec ses doigts, afin d'avoir le plaisirde toucher les siens. La jeune fille rougit d'orgueil, et passa outre,en lui jetant ce regard, mele de honte et d'audace, qui n'estl'expression ni de la fierte ni de la pudeur.Des qu'elles furent rentrees dans l'interieur du couvent, le galantpatricien revint sous la nef, et abordant le professeur qui descendaitplus lentement de la tribune: "Par le corps de Bacchus! vous allez medire, mon cher maitre, s'ecria-t-il, laquelle de vos eleves a chante le_Salve Regina_.--Et pourquoi voulez-vous le savoir, comte Zustiniani? repondit leprofesseur en sortant avec lui de l'eglise.--Pour vous en faire mon compliment, reprit le patricien. Il y alongtemps que je suis, non-seulement vos vepres, mais jusqu'a vosexercices; car vous savez combien je suis _dilettante_ de musiquesacree. Eh bien, voici la premiere-fois que j'entends chanter duPergolese d'une maniere aussi parfaite; et quant a la voix, c'estcertainement la plus belle que j'aie rencontree dans ma vie.--Par le Christ! je le crois bien! repliqua le professeur en savourantune large prise de tabac avec complaisance et dignite.--Dites-moi donc le nom de la creature celeste qui m'a jete dans de telsravissements. Malgre vos severites et vos plaintes continuelles, on peutdire que vous avez fait de votre ecole une des meilleures de toutel'Italie; vos choeurs sont excellents, et vos solos fort estimables;mais la musique que vous faites executer est si grande, si austere, quebien rarement de jeunes filles peuvent en faire sentir toutes lesbeautes....--Elles ne les font point sentir, dit le professeur avec tristesse,parce qu'elle ne les sentent point elles-memes! Pour des voix fraiches,etendues, timbrees, nous n'en manquons pas, Dieu merci! mais pour desorganisations musicales, helas! qu'elles sont rares et incompletes!--Du moins vous en possedez une admirablement douee: l'instrument estmagnifique, le sentiment parfait, le savoir remarquable. Nommez-la-moidonc.--N'est-ce pas, dit le professeur en eludant la question, qu'elle vous afait plaisir?--Elle m'a pris au coeur, elle m'a arrache des larmes, et par des moyenssi simples, par des effets si peu cherches, que je n'y comprenais riend'abord. Et puis, je me suis rappele ce que vous m'avez dit tant de foisen m'enseignant votre art divin, o mon cher maitre! et pour la premierefois, moi j'ai compris combien vous aviez raison.--Et qu'est-ce que je vous disais? reprit encore le maestro d'un air detriomphe.--Vous me disiez, repondit le comte, que le grand, le vrai, le beau dansles arts, c'etait le simple.--- Je vous disais bien aussi qu'il y avait le _brillant_, le _cherche_,l'_habile_, et qu'il y avait souvent lieu d'applaudir et de remarquerces qualites-la?--Sans doute; mais de ces qualites secondaires a la vraie manifestationdu genie, il y a un abime, disiez-vous. Eh bien, cher maitre! votrecantatrice est seule d'un cote, et toutes les autres sont en deca.--C'est vrai, et c'est bien dit, observa le professeur se frottant lesmains.--Son nom? reprit le comte.--Quel nom? dit le malin professeur.--Et, _per Dio santo!_ celui de la sirene ou plutot de l'archange que jeviens d'entendre.--Et qu'en voulez-vous faire de son nom, seigneur comte? repliqua lePorpora d'un ton severe.--Monsieur le professeur, pourquoi voulez-vous m'en faire un secret?--Je vous dirai pourquoi, si vous commencez par me dire a quelles finsvous le demandez si instamment.--N'est-ce pas un sentiment bien naturel et veritablement irresistible,que celui qui nous pousse a connaitre, a nommer et a voir les objets denotre admiration?--Eh bien, ce n'est pas la votre seul motif; laissez-moi, cher comte,vous donner ce dementi. Vous etes grand amateur, et bon connaisseur enmusique, je le sais: mais vous etes, par-dessus tout, proprietaire dutheatre San-Samuel. Vous mettez votre gloire, encore plus que votreinteret, a attirer les plus beaux talents et les plus belles voixd'Italie. Vous savez bien que nous donnons de bonnes lecons; que cheznous seulement se font les fortes etudes et se forment les grandesmusiciennes. Vous nous avez deja enleve la Corilla; et comme elle voussera peut-etre enlevee au premier jour par un engagement avec quelqueautre theatre, vous venez roder autour de notre ecole, pour voir si nousne vous avons pas forme quelque nouvelle Corilla que vous vous tenezpret a capturer ... Voila la verite, monsieur le comte: avouez que j'aidit la verite.--Et quand cela serait, cher maestro, repondit le comte en souriant, quevous importe, et quel mal y trouvez-vous?--J'en trouve un fort grand, seigneur comte; c'est que vous corrompez,vous perdez ces pauvres creatures.--Ah ca, comment l'entendez-vous, farouche professeur? Depuis quand vousfaites-vous le pere gardien de ces vertus fragiles?--Je l'entends comme il faut, monsieur le comte, et ne me soucie ni deleur vertu, ni de leur fragilite; mais je me soucie de leur talent, quevous denaturez et que vous avilissez sur vos theatres, en leur donnant achanter de la musique vulgaire et de mauvais gout. N'est-ce point unedesolation, une honte de voir, cette Corilla, qui commencait acomprendre grandement l'art serieux, descendre du sacre au profane, dela priere au badinage, de l'autel au treteau, du sublime au ridicule,d'Allegri et de Palestrina a Albinoni et au barbier Apollini?--Ainsi vous refusez, dans votre rigorisme, de me nommer cette fille,sur laquelle je ne puis avoir des vues, puisque j'ignore si elle posseded'ailleurs les qualites requises pour le theatre?--Je m'y refuse absolument.--Et vous pensez que je ne le decouvrirai pas?--Helas! vous le decouvrirez, si telle est votre determination: mais jeferai tout mon possible pour vous empecher de nous l'enlever.--Eh bien; maitre, vous etes deja a moitie vaincu; car je l'ai vue, jel'ai devinee, je l'ai reconnue, votre divinite mysterieuse.--Oui da? dit le maitre d'un air mefiant et reserve; en etes-vous biensur?--Mes yeux et mon coeur me l'ont revelee; et je vais vous faire sonportrait pour vous en convaincre. Elle est grande: c'est, je crois, laplus grande de toutes vos eleves; elle est blanche comme la neige duFrioul, et rose comme l'horizon au matin d'un beau jour; elle a descheveux dores, des yeux d'azur, un aimable embonpoint; et porte au doigtun petit rubis qui m'a brule en effleurant ma main comme l'etincelled'un feu magique.--Bravo! s'ecria le Porpora d'un air narquois. Je n'ai rien a vouscacher, en ce cas; et le nom de cette beaute, c'est la Clorinda. Allezdonc lui faire vos offres seduisantes; donnez-lui de l'or, des diamantset des chiffons. Vous l'engagerez facilement dans votre troupe, et ellepourra peut-etre vous remplacer la Corilla; car le public de vostheatres prefere aujourd'hui de belles epaules a de beaux sons, et desyeux hardis a une intelligence elevee.--Me serais-je donc trompe, mon cher maitre? dit le comte un peu confus;la Clorinda ne serait-elle qu'une beaute vulgaire?--Et si ma sirene, ma divinite, mon archange, comme il vous plait del'appeler, n'etait rien moins que belle? reprit le maitre avec malice.--Si elle etait difforme, je vous supplierais de ne jamais me lamontrer, car mon illusion serait trop cruellement detruite. Si elleetait seulement laide, je pourrais l'adorer encore; mais je nel'engagerais pas pour le theatre, parce que le talent sans la beauten'est parfois qu'un malheur, une lutte, une supplice pour une femme. Queregardez-vous, maestro, et pourquoi vous arretez-vous ainsi?--Nous voici a l'embarcadere ou se tiennent les gondoles, et je n'envois aucune. Mais vous, comte, que regardez-vous ainsi par la?--Je regarde si ce jeune gars, que vous voyez assis sur les degres del'embarcadere aupres d'une petite fille assez vilaine, n'est point monprotege Anzoleto, le plus intelligent et le plus joli de nos petitsplebeiens. Regardez-le, cher maestro, ceci vous interesse comme moi. Cetenfant a la plus belle voix de tenor qui soit dans Venise; il a un goutpassionne pour la musique et des dispositions incroyables. Il y alongtemps que je veux vous parler de lui et vous prier de lui donner deslecons. Celui-la, je le destine veritablement a soutenir le succes demon theatre, et dans quelques annees, j'espere etre bien recompense demes soins. Hola, Zoto! viens ici, mon enfant, que je te presente al'illustre maitre Porpora.Anzoleto tira ses jambes nues de l'eau, ou elles pendaient avecinsouciance tandis qu'il s'occupait a percer d'une grosse aiguille cesjolies coquillages qu'on appelle poetiquement a Venise _fiori di mare_.Il avait pour tout vetement une culotte fort rapee et une chemise assezfine, mais fort dechiree, a travers laquelle on voyait ses epaulesblanches et modelees comme celles d'un petit Bacchus antique. Il avaiteffectivement la beaute grecque d'un jeune faune, et sa physionomieoffrait le melange singulier, mais bien frequent dans ces creations dela statuaire paienne, d'une melancolie reveuse et d'une ironiqueinsouciance. Ses cheveux crepus, bien que fins, d'un blond vif un peucuivre par le soleil, se roulaient en mille boucles epaisses et courtesautour de son cou d'albatre. Tous ses traits etaient d'une perfectionincomparable; mais il y avait, dans le regard penetrant de ses yeuxnoirs comme l'encre, quelque chose de trop hardi qui ne plut pas auprofesseur. L'enfant se leva bien vite a la voix de Zustiniani, jetatous ses coquillages sur les genoux de la petite fille assise a cote delui, et tandis que celle-ci, sans se deranger, continuait a les enfileret a les entremeler de petites perles d'or, il s'approcha, et vintbaiser la main du comte, a la maniere du pays.--Voici en effet un beau garcon, dit le professeur en lui donnant unepetite tape sur la joue. Mais il me parait occupe a des amusements bienpuerils pour son age: car enfin il a bien dix-huit ans, n'est-ce pas?--Dix-neuf bientot, _sior profesor_, repondit Anzoleto dans le dialectevenitien; mais si je m'amuse avec des coquilles, c'est pour aider lapetite Consuelo qui fabrique des colliers.--Consuelo, repondit le maitre en se rapprochant de son eleve avec lecomte et Anzoleto, je ne croyais pas que tu eusses le gout de la parure.--Oh! ce n'est pas pour moi, monsieur le professeur, repondit Consueloen se levant a demi avec precaution pour ne pas faire tomber dans l'eaules coquilles entassees dans son tablier; c'est pour le vendre, et pouracheter du riz et du mais.--Elle est pauvre, et elle nourrit sa mere, dit le Porpora. Ecoute,Consuelo: quand vous etes dans l'embarras, ta mere et toi, il faut venirme trouver; mais je te defends de mendier, entends-tu bien?--Oh! vous n'avez que faire de le lui defendre, _sior profesor_,repondit vivement Anzoleto; elle ne le ferait pas; et puis, moi, je l'enempecherais.--Mais toi, tu n'as rien? dit le comte.--Rien que vos bontes, seigneur illustrissime; mais nous partageons, lapetite et moi.--- Elle donc ta parente?--Non, c'est une etrangere, c'est Consuelo.--Consuelo? quel nom bizarre! dit le comte.--Un beau nom, illustrissime, reprit Anzoleto; cela veut direconsolation.--A la bonne heure. Elle est ton amie, a ce qu'il me semble?--Elle est ma fiancee, seigneur.--Deja? Voyez ces enfants qui songent deja au mariage!--Nous nous marierons le jour ou vous signerez mon engagement au theatrede San-Samuel, illustrissime.--En ce cas, vous attendrez encore longtemps, mes petits.--Oh! nous attendrons, dit Consuelo avec le calme enjoue del'innocence."Le comte et le maestro s'egayerent quelques moments de la candeur, etdes reparties de ce jeune couple; puis, ayant donne rendez-vous aAnzoleto pour qu'il fit entendre sa voix au professeur le lendemain, ilss'eloignerent, le laissant a ses graves occupations."Comment trouvez-vous cette petite fille? dit le professeur aZustiniani.--Je l'avais vue deja, il n'y a qu'un instant, et je la trouve assezlaide pour justifier l'axiome qui dit: Aux yeux d'un homme de dix-huitans, toute femme semble belle.--C'est bon, repondit le professeur; maintenant je puis donc vous direque votre divine cantatrice, votre sirene, votre mysterieuse beaute,c'etait Consuelo.--Elle! ce sale enfant? cette noire et maigre sauterelle? impossible,maestro!--Elle-meme, seigneur comte. Ne ferait-elle pas une _prima donna_ bienseduisante?"Le comte s'arreta, se retourna, examina encore de loin Consuelo, etjoignant les mains avec un desespoir assez comique:"Juste ciel! s'ecria-t-il, peux-tu faire de semblables meprises, etverser le feu du genie dans des tetes si mal ebauchees!--Ainsi, vous renoncez a vos projets coupables? Dit le professeur.--Bien certainement.--Vous me le promettez? ajouta le Porpora.--Oh! je vous le jure, repondit le comte."III.Eclos sous le ciel de l'Italie, eleve par hasard comme un oiseau desrivages, pauvre, orphelin abandonne, et cependant heureux dans lepresent et confiant dans l'avenir comme un enfant de l'amour qu'il etaitsans doute, Anzoleto, ce beau garcon de dix-neuf ans, qui passait tousses jours aupres de la petite Consuelo, dans la plus complete liberte,sur le pave de Venise, n'en etait pas, comme on peut le croire, a sespremieres amours. Initie aux voluptes faciles qui s'etaient offertes alui plus d'une fois, il eut ete use deja et corrompu peut-etre, s'il eutvecu dans nos tristes climats, et si la nature l'eut doue d'uneorganisation moins riche. Mais, developpe de bonne heure et destine aune longue et puissante virilite, il avait encore le coeur pur et lessens contenus par la volonte. Le hasard lui avait fait rencontrer lapetite Espagnole devant les Madoriettes, chantant des cantiques pardevotion; et lui, pour le plaisir d'exercer sa voix, il avait chanteavec elle aux etoiles durant des soirees entieres. Et puis ils s'etaientrencontres sur les sables du Lido, ramassant des coquillages, lui pourles manger, elle pour en faire des chapelets et des ornements. Et puisencore ils s'etaient rencontres a l'eglise, elle priant le bon Dieu detout son coeur, lui regardant les belles dames de tous ses yeux. Et danstoutes ces rencontres, Consuelo lui avait semble si bonne, si douce, siobligeante, si gaie, qu'il s'etait fait son ami et son compagnoninseparable, sans trop savoir pourquoi ni comment. Anzoleto neconnaissait encore de l'amour que le plaisir. Il eprouva de l'amitiepour Consuelo; et comme il etait d'un pays et d'un peuple ou lespassions regnent plus que les attachements, il ne sut point donner acette amitie un autre nom que celui d'amour. Consuelo accepta cettefacon de parler; apres qu'elle eut fait a Anzoleto l'objection suivante:"Si tu te dis mon amoureux, c'est donc que tu veux te marier avec moi?"et qu'il lui eut repondu: "Bien certainement, si tu le veux, nous nousmarierons ensemble."Ce fut des lors une chose arretee. Peut-etre qu'Anzoleto s'en fit unjeu, tandis que Consuelo y crut de la meilleure foi du monde. Mais ilest certain que deja ce jeune coeur eprouvait ces sentiments contraireset ces emotions compliquees qui agitent et desunissent l'existence deshommes blases.Abandonne a des instincts violents, avide de plaisirs, n'aimant que cequi servait a son bonheur, haissant et fuyant tout ce qui s'opposait asa joie, artiste jusqu'aux os, c'est-a-dire cherchant et sentant la vieavec une intensite effrayante, il trouva que ses maitresses luiimposaient les souffrances et les dangers de passions qu'il n'eprouvaitpas profondement. Cependant il les voyait de temps en temps; rappele parses desirs, repousse bientot apres par la satiete ou le depit. Et quandcet etrange enfant avait ainsi depense sans ideal et sans dignitel'exces de sa vie, il sentait le besoin d'une societe douce et d'uneexpansion chaste et sereine. Il eut put dire deja, comme Jean-Jacques:"Tant il est vrai que ce qui nous attache le plus aux femmes est moinsla debauche qu'un certain agrement de vivre aupres d'elles!" Alors, sansse rendre compte du charme qui l'attirait vers Consuelo, n'ayant guereencore le sens du beau, et ne sachant si elle etait laide ou jolie,enfant lui-meme au point de s'amuser avec elle de jeux au-dessous de sonage, homme au point de respecter scrupuleusement ses quatorze ans, ilmenait avec elle, en public, sur les marbres et sur les flots de Venise,une vie aussi heureuse, aussi pure, aussi cachee, et presque aussipoetique que celle de Paul et Virginie sous les pamplemousses du desert.Quoiqu'ils eussent une liberte plus absolue et plus dangereuse, point defamille, point de meres vigilantes et tendres pour les former a lavertu, point de serviteur devoue pour les chercher le soir et lesramener au bercail; pas meme un chien pour les avertir du danger, ils nefirent aucun genre de chute. Ils coururent les lagunes en barquedecouverte, a toute heure et par tous les temps, sans rames et sanspilote; ils errerent sur les paludes sans guide, sans montre, et sanssouci de la maree montante; ils chanterent devant les chapelles dresseessous la vigne au coin des rues, sans songer a l'heure avancee, et sansavoir besoin d'autre lit jusqu'au matin que la dalle blanche encoretiede des feux du jour. Ils s'arreterent devant le theatre dePulcinella, et suivirent avec une attention passionnee le dramefantastique de la belle Corisande, reine des marionnettes, sans serappeler l'absence du dejeuner el le peu de probabilite du souper. Ilsse livrerent aux amusements effrenes du carnaval, ayant pour toutdeguisement et pour toute parure, lui sa veste retournee a l'envers,elle un gros noeud de vieux rubans sur l'oreille. Ils firent des repassomptueux sur la rampe d'un pont, ou sur les marches d'un palais avecdes fruits de mer[1], des tiges de fenouil cru, ou des ecorces decedrat. Enfin ils menerent joyeuse et libre vie, sans plus de caressesperilleuses ni de sentiments amoureux que n'en eussent echange deuxhonnetes enfants du meme age et du meme sexe. Les jours, les anneess'ecoulerent. Anzoleto eut d'autres maitresses; Consuelo ne sut pas memequ'on put avoir d'autres amours que celui dont elle etait l'objet. Elledevint une jeune fille sans se croire obligee a plus de reserve avec sonfiance; et lui la vit grandir et se transformer, sans eprouverd'impatience et sans desirer de changement a cette intimite sans nuage,sans scrupule, sans mystere, et sans remords.[1 Diverses sortes de coquillages tres-grossier et a fort bas prix dontle peuple de Venise est friand.]Il y avait quatre ans deja que le professeur Porpora et le comteZustiniani s'etaient mutuellement presente leurs _petits musiciens_, etdepuis ce temps le comte n'avait plus pense a la jeune chanteuse demusique sacree; depuis ce temps, le professeur avait egalement oublie lebel Anzoleto, vu qu'il ne l'avait trouve, apres un premier examen, doued'aucune des qualites qu'il exigeait dans un eleve: d'abord une natured'intelligence serieuse et patiente, ensuite une modestie pousseejusqu'a l'annihilation de l'eleve devant les maitres, enfin une absencecomplete d'etudes musicales anterieures a celles qu'il voulait donnerlui-meme. "Ne me parlez jamais, disait-il, d'un ecolier dont le cerveaune soit pas sous ma volonte comme une table rase, comme une cire viergeou je puisse jeter la premiere empreinte. Je n'ai pas le temps deconsacrer une annee a faire desapprendre avant de commencer a montrer.Si vous voulez que j'ecrive sur une ardoise, presentez-la-moi nette. Cen'est pas tout, donnez-la-moi de bonne qualite. Si elle est tropepaisse, je ne pourrai l'entamer; si elle est trop mince, je la briseraiau premier trait." En somme, bien qu'il reconnut les moyensextraordinaires du jeune Anzoleto, il declara au comte, avec quelquehumeur et avec une ironique humilite a la fin de la premiere lecon, quesa methode n'etait pas le fait d'un eleve deja si avance, et que lepremier maitre venu _suffirait pour embarrasser et retarder les progresnaturels et le developpement invincible de cette magnifiqueorganisation_.Le comte envoya son protege chez le professeur Mellifiore, qui deroulade en cadence, et de trilles en grupetti, le conduisit a l'entierdeveloppement de ses qualites brillantes; si bien que lorsqu'il eutvingt-trois ans accomplis, il fut juge, par tous ceux qui l'entendirentdans le salon du comte, capable de debuter a San-Samuel avec un grandsucces dans les premiers roles.Un soir, toute la noblesse dilettante, et tous les artistes un peurenommes qui se trouvaient a Venise furent pries d'assister a uneepreuve finale et decisive. Pour la premiere fois de sa vie, Anzoletoquitta sa souquenille plebeienne, endossa un habit noir, une veste desatin, releva et poudra ses beaux cheveux, chaussa des souliers aboucles, prit un maintien compose, et se glissa sur la pointe du piedjusqu'a un clavecin, ou, a la clarte de cent bougies, et sous lesregards de deux ou trois cents personnes, il suivit des yeux laritournelle, enflamma ses poumons, et se lanca, avec son audace, sonambition et son _ut_ de poitrine, dans cette carriere perilleuse ou, nonpas un jury, non pas un juge, mais tout un public, tient d'une main lapalme et de l'autre le sifflet.Si Anzoleto etait emu interieurement, il ne faut pas le demander;cependant il y parut fort peu, et a peine ses yeux percants, quiinterrogeaient a la derobee ceux des femmes, eurent-ils devine cetteapprobation secrete qu'on refuse rarement a un aussi beau jeune homme, apeine les amateurs, surpris d'une telle puissance de timbre et d'unetelle facilite de vocalisation, eurent-ils fait entendre autour d'euxdes murmures favorables, que la joie et l'espoir inonderent tout sonetre. Alors aussi, pour la premiere fois de sa vie, Anzoleto, jusque-lavulgairement compris et vulgairement enseigne, sentit qu'il n'etaitpoint un homme vulgaire, et transporte par le besoin et le sentiment dutriomphe, il chanta avec une energie, une originalite et une ververemarquables. Certes, son gout ne fut pas toujours pur, ni son executionsans reproche dans toutes les parties du morceau; mais il sut toujoursse relever par des traits d'audace, par des eclairs d'intelligence etdes elans d'enthousiasme. Il manqua des effets que le compositeur avaitmenages; mais il en trouva d'autres auxquels personne n'avait songe, nil'auteur qui les avait traces, ni le professeur qui les avaitinterpretes, ni aucun des virtuoses qui les avaient rendus. Ceshardiesses saisirent et enleverent tout le monde. Pour une innovation,on lui pardonna dix maladresses; pour un sentiment individuel, dixrebellions contre la methode. Tant il est vrai qu'en fait d'art, lemoindre eclair de genie, le moindre essor vers de nouvelles conquetes,exerce sur les hommes plus de fascination que toutes les ressources ettoutes les lumieres de la science dans les limites du connu.Personne peut-etre ne se rendit compte des causes et personne n'echappaaux effets de cet enthousiasme. La Corilla venait d'ouvrir la seance parun grand air bien chante et vivement applaudi; cependant le succesqu'obtint le jeune debutant effaca tellement le sien qu'elle enressentit un mouvement de rage. Mais au moment ou Anzoleto, accable delouanges et de caresses, revint aupres du clavecin ou elle etait assise,il lui dit en se penchant vers elle avec un melange de soumission etd'audace: "Et vous, reine du chant, reine de la beaute, n'avez-vous pasun regard d'encouragement pour le pauvre malheureux qui vous craint etqui vous adore?"La prima-donna, surprise de tant de hardiesse, regarda de pres ce beauvisage qu'elle avait a peine daigne apercevoir; car quelle femme vaineet triomphante daignerait faire attention a un enfant obscur et pauvre?Elle le remarqua enfin; elle fut frappee de sa beaute: son regard pleinde feu penetra en elle, et, vaincue, fascinee a son tour, elle laissatomber sur lui une longue et profonde oeillade qui fut comme le scelappose sur son brevet de celebrite. Dans cette memorable soiree,Anzoleto avait domine son public et desarme son plus redoutable ennemi;car la belle cantatrice n'etait pas seulement reine sur les planches,mais encore a l'administration et dans le cabinet du comte Zustiniani.IV.Au milieu des applaudissements unanimes, et meme un peu insenses, que lavoix et la maniere du debutant avaient provoques, un seul auditeur,assis sur le bord de sa chaise, les jambes serrees et les mainsimmobiles sur ses genoux, a la maniere des dieux egyptiens, restait muetcomme un sphinx et mysterieux comme un hieroglyphe: c'etait le savantprofesseur et compositeur celebre, Porpora. Tandis que son galantcollegue, le professeur Mellifiore, s'attribuant tout l'honneur dusucces d'Anzoleto, se pavanait aupres des femmes, et saluait tous leshommes avec souplesse pour remercier jusqu'a leurs regards, le maitre duchant sacre se tenait la les yeux a terre, les sourcils fronces, labouche close, et comme perdu dans ses reflexions. Lorsque toute lasociete, qui etait priee ce soir-la a un grand bal chez la dogaresse, sefut ecoulee peu a peu, et que les dilettanti les plus chauds resterentseulement avec quelques dames et les principaux artistes autour duclavecin, Zustiniani s'approcha du severe maestro.--C'est trop bouder contre les modernes, mon cher professeur, luidit-il, et votre silence ne m'en impose point. Vous voulez jusqu'au boutfermer vos sens a cette musique profane et a cette maniere nouvelle quinous charment. Votre coeur s'est ouvert malgre vous, et vos oreilles ontrecu le venin de la seduction.--Voyons, _sior profesor_, dit en dialecte la charmante Corilla,reprenant avec son ancien maitre les manieres enfantines de la _scuola_,il faut que vous m'accordiez une grace....--Loin de moi, malheureuse fille! s'ecria le maitre, riant a demi, etresistant avec un reste d'humeur aux caresses de son inconstante eleve.Qu'y a-t-il desormais de commun entre nous? Je ne te connais plus. Porteailleurs tes beaux sourires et tes gazouillements perfides.--Le voila qui s'adoucit, dit la Corilla en prenant d'une main le brasdu debutant, sans cesser de chiffonner de l'autre l'ample cravateblanche du professeur. Viens ici, Zoto[1], et plie le genou devant leplus savant maitre de chant de toute l'Italie. Humilie-toi, mon enfant,et desarme sa rigueur. Un mot de lui, si tu peux l'obtenir, doit avoirplus de prix pour toi que toutes les trompettes de la renommee.[1 Contraction d'_Anzoleto_, qui est le diminutif d'_Angelo, Anzolo_ endialecte.]--Vous avez ete bien severe pour moi, monsieur le professeur, ditAnzoleto en s'inclinant devant lui avec une modestie un peu railleuse;cependant mon unique pensee, depuis quatre ans, a ete de vous fairerevoquer un arret bien cruel; et si je n'y suis pas parvenu ce soir,j'ignore si j'aurai le courage de reparaitre devant le public, chargecomme me voila de votre anatheme.--Enfant, dit le professeur en se levant avec une vivacite et en parlantavec une conviction qui le rendirent noble et grand, de crochu etmaussade qu'il semblait a l'ordinaire, laisse aux femmes les mielleuseset perfides paroles. Ne t'abaisse jamais au langage de la flatterie,meme devant ton superieur, a plus forte raison devant celui dont tudedaignes interieurement le suffrage. Il y a une heure tu etais la-basdans ce coin, pauvre, ignore, craintif; tout ton avenir tenait a uncheveu, a un son de ton gosier, a un instant de defaillance dans tesmoyens, a un caprice de ton auditoire. Un hasard, un effort, un instant,t'ont fait riche, celebre, insolent. La carriere est ouverte, tu n'asplus qu'a y courir tant que tes forces t'y soutiendront. Ecoute donc;car pour la premiere fois, pour la derniere peut-etre, tu vas entendrela verite. Tu es dans une mauvaise voie, tu chantes mal, et tu aimes lamauvaise musique. Tu ne sais rien, tu n'as rien etudie a fond. Tu n'asque de l'exercice et de la facilite. Tu te passionnes a froid; tu saisroucouler, gazouiller comme ces demoiselles gentilles et coquettesauxquelles on pardonne de minauder ce qu'elles ne savent pas chanter.Mais tu ne sais point phraser, tu prononces mal, tu as un accentvulgaire, un style faux et commun. Ne te decourage pas pourtant; tu astous les defauts, mais tu as de quoi les vaincre; car tu as les qualitesque ne peuvent donner ni l'enseignement ni le travail; tu as ce que nepeuvent faire perdre ni les mauvais conseils ni les mauvais exemples, tuas le feu sacre ... tu as le genie!... Helas! un feu qui n'eclairerarien de grand, un genie qui demeurera sterile ... car, je le vois danstes yeux, comme je l'ai senti dans ta poitrine, tu n'as pas le culte del'art, tu n'as pas de foi pour les grands maitres, ni de respect pourles grandes creations; tu aimes la gloire, rien que la gloire, et pourtoi seul ... Tu aurais pu ... tu pourrais ... Mais non, il est trop tard,ta destinee sera la course d'un meteore, comme celle de...."Et le professeur enfoncant brusquement son chapeau sur sa tete, tournale dos, et s'en alla sans saluer personne, absorbe qu'il etait dans ledeveloppement interieur de son enigmatique sentence.Quoique tout le monde s'efforcat de rire des bizarreries du professeur,elles laisserent une impression penible et comme un sentiment de douteet de tristesse durant quelques instants. Anzoleto fut le premier quiparut n'y plus songer, bien qu'elles lui eussent cause une emotionprofonde de joie, d'orgueil, de colere et d'emulation dont toute sa viedevait etre desormais la consequence. Il parut uniquement occupe deplaire a la Corilla; et il sut si bien le lui persuader, qu'elle s'epritde lui tres serieusement a cette premiere rencontre. Le comte Zustinianin'etait pas fort jaloux d'elle, et peut-etre avait-il ses raisons pourne pas la gener beaucoup. De plus, il s'interessait a la gloire et al'eclat de son theatre plus qu'a toute chose au monde; non qu'il fut_vilain_ a l'endroit des richesses, mais parce qu'il etait vraiment;fanatique de ce qu'on appelle les _beaux-arts_. C'est, selon moi, uneexpression qui convient a un certain sentiment vulgaire; tout italien etpar consequent passionne sans beaucoup de discernement. Le _culte del'art_, expression plus moderne, et dont tout le monde ne se servait pasil y a cent ans, a un sens tout autre que le _gout des beaux-arts_. Lecomte etait en effet _homme de gout_ comme on l'entendait alors,amateur, et rien de plus. Mais la satisfaction de ce gout etait la plusgrande affaire de sa vie. Il aimait a s'occuper du public et a l'occuperde lui; a frequenter les artistes, a regner sur la mode, a faire parlerde son theatre, de son luxe, de son amabilite, de sa magnificence. Ilavait, en un mot, la passion dominante des grands seigneurs de province,l'ostentation. Posseder et diriger un theatre etait le meilleur moyen decontenter et de divertir toute la ville. Plus heureux encore s'il eut pufaire asseoir toute la Republique a sa table! Quand des etrangersdemandaient au professeur Porpora ce que c'etait que le comteZustiniani, il avait coutume de repondre: C'est un homme qui aime aregaler, et qui sert de la musique sur son theatre comme des faisans sursa table.Vers une heure du matin on se separa."Anzolo, dit la Corilla, qui se trouvait seule avec lui dans uneembrasure du balcon, ou demeures-tu?"A cette question inattendue, Anzoleto se sentit rougir et palir presquesimultanement; car comment avouer a cette merveilleuse et opulentebeaute qu'il n'avait quasi ni feu ni lieu? Encore cette reponse eut-elleete plus facile a faire que l'aveu de la miserable taniere ou il seretirait les nuits qu'il ne passait pas par gout ou par necessite a labelle etoile."Eh bien, qu'est-ce que ma question a de si extraordinaire? dit laCorilla en riant de son trouble.--Je me demandais, moi, repondit Anzoleto avec beaucoup de presenced'esprit, quel palais de rois ou de fees pourrait etre digne del'orgueilleux mortel qui y porterait le souvenir d'un regard d'amour dela Corilla!--Et que pretend dire par la ce flatteur? reprit-elle en lui lancant leplus brulant regard qu'elle put tirer de son arsenal de diableries.--Que je n'ai pas ce bonheur, repondit le jeune homme; mais que si jel'avais, j'aurais l'orgueil de ne vouloir demeurer qu'entre le ciel etla mer, comme les etoiles.--Ou comme les _cuccali?_ s'ecria la cantatrice en eclatant de rire. Onsait que les goelands sont des oiseaux d'une simplicite proverbiale, etque leur maladresse equivaut, dans le langage de Venise, a notrelocution, _etourdi comme un hanneton._--Raillez-moi, meprisez-moi, repondit Anzoleto; je crois que j'aimeencore mieux cela que de ne pas vous occuper du tout.--Allons, puisque tu ne veux me repondre que par metaphores,reprit-elle, je vais t'emmener dans ma gondole, sauf a t'eloigner de tademeure, au lieu de t'en rapprocher. Si je te joue ce mauvais tour,c'est ta faute.--Etait-ce la le motif de votre curiosite, signora? En ce cas ma reponseest bien courte et bien claire: Je demeure sur les marches de votrepalais.--Va donc m'attendre sur les marches de celui ou nous sommes, dit laCorilla en baissant la voix; car Zustiniani pourrait bien blamerl'indulgence avec laquelle j'ecoute tes fadaises."Dans le premier elan de sa vanite, Anzoleto s'esquiva, et courutvoltiger de l'embarcadere du palais a la proue de la gondole de Corilla,comptant les secondes aux battements rapides de son coeur enivre. Maisavant qu'elle parut sur les marches du palais, bien des reflexionspasserent par la cervelle active et ambitieuse du debutant. La Corillaest toute-puissante, se dit-il, mais si, a force de lui plaire, j'allaisdeplaire au comte? ou bien si j'allais par mon trop facile triomphe, luifaire perdre la puissance qu'elle tient de lui, en le degoutant tout afait d'une maitresse si volage?Dans ces perplexites, Anzoleto mesura de l'oeil l'escalier qu'il pouvaitremonter encore, et il songeait a effectuer son evasion, lorsque lesflambeaux brillerent sous le portique, et la belle Corilla, enveloppeede son mantelet d'hermine, parut sur les premiers degres, au milieu d'ungroupe de cavaliers jaloux de soutenir son coude arrondi dans le creuxde leur main, et de l'aider ainsi a descendre, comme c'est la coutume aVenise."Eh bien, dit le gondolier de la prima-donna a Anzoleto eperdu, quefaites-vous la? Entrez dans la gondole bien vite, si vous en avez lapermission; ou bien suivez la rive et courez, car le seigneur comte estavec la signora."Anzoleto se jeta au fond de la gondole sans savoir ce qu'il faisait. Ilavait la tete perdue. Mais a peine y fut-il, qu'il s'imagina la stupeuret l'indignation qu'eprouverait le comte s'il entrait dans la gondoleavec sa maitresse, en trouvant la son insolent protege. Son angoisse futd'autant plus cruelle qu'elle se prolongea plus de cinq minutes. Lasignera s'etait arretee au beau milieu de l'escalier. Elle causait,riait tres-haut avec son cortege, et, discutant sur un trait, elle lerepetait a pleine voix de plusieurs manieres differentes. Sa voix claireet vibrante allait se perdre sur les palais et sur les coupoles ducanal, comme le chant du coq reveille avant l'aube se perd dans lesilence des campagnes.Anzoleto, n'y pouvant plus tenir, resolut de s'elancer dans l'eau parl'ouverture de la gondole qui ne faisait pas face a l'escalier. Deja ilavait fait glisser la glace dans son panneau de velours noir, et deja ilavait passe une jambe dehors, lorsque le second rameur de la prima-donna,celui qui occupait a la poupe, se penchant vers lui sur le flanc de lacabanette, lui dit a voix basse:"Puisqu'on chante, cela veut dire que vous devez vous tenir coi, etattendre sans crainte."Je ne connaissais pas les usages, pensa Anzoleto, et il attendit, maisnon sans un reste de frayeur douloureuse. La Corilla se donna le plaisird'amener le comte jusqu'a la proue de sa gondole, et de s'y tenir debouten lui adressant les compliments de _felicissima notte_, jusqu'a cequ'elle eut quitte la rive: puis elle vint s'asseoir aupres de sonnouvel amant avec autant de naturel et de tranquillite que si elle n'eutpas risque la vie de celui-ci et sa propre fortune a ce jeu impertinent."Vous voyez bien la Corilla? disait pendant ce temps Zustiniani au comteBarberigo; eh bien, je parierai ma tete qu'elle n'est pas seule dans sagondole.--Et comment pouvez-vous avoir une pareille idee? reprit Barberigo.--Parce qu'elle m'a fait mille instances pour que je la reconduisisse ason palais.--Et vous n'etes pas plus jaloux que cela?--Il y a longtemps que je suis gueri de cette faiblesse. Je donneraisbeaucoup pour que notre premiere cantatrice s'eprit serieusement dequelqu'un qui lui fit preferer le sejour de Venise aux reves de voyagedont elle me menace. Je puis tres-bien me consoler de ses infidelites;mais je ne pourrais remplacer ni sa voix, ni son talent, ni la fureur dupublic qu'elle captive a San-Samuel.--Je comprends; mais qui donc peut etre ce soir l'amant heureux de cettefolle princesse?"Le comte et son ami passerent en revue tous ceux que la Corilla avait puremarquer et encourager dans la soiree. Anzoleto fut absolument le seuldont ils ne s'aviserent pas.V.Cependant un violent combat s'elevait dans l'ame de cet heureux amantque l'onde et la nuit emportaient dans leurs ombres tranquilles, eperduet palpitant aupres de la plus celebre beaute de Venise. D'une part,Anzoleto sentait fermenter en lui l'ardeur d'un desir que la joie del'orgueil satisfait rendait plus puissant encore; mais d'un autre cote,la crainte de deplaire bientot, d'etre raille, econduit ettraitreusement accuse aupres du comte, venait refroidir ses transports.Prudent et ruse comme un vrai Venitien, il n'avait pas, depuis six ans,aspire au theatre sans s'etre bien renseigne sur le compte de la femmefantasque et imperieuse qui en gouvernait toutes les intrigues. Il avaittout lieu de penser que son regne aupres d'elle serait de courte duree;et s'il ne s'etait pas soustrait a ce dangereux honneur, c'est que, nele prevoyant pas si proche, il avait ete subjugue et enleve parsurprise. Il avait cru se faire tolerer par sa courtoisie, et voilaqu'il etait deja aime pour sa jeunesse, sa beaute et sa gloirenaissante! Maintenant, se dit Anzoleto avec cette rapidite d'apercus etde conclusions que possedent quelques tetes merveilleusement organisees,il ne me reste plus qu'a me faire craindre, si je ne veux toucher aulendemain amer et ridicule de mon triomphe. Mais comment me fairecraindre, moi, pauvre diable, de la reine des enfers en personne? Sonparti fut bientot pris. Il se jeta dans un systeme de mefiance, dejalousies et d'amertumes dont la coquetterie passionnee etonna laprima-donna. Toute leur causerie ardente et legere peut se resumerainsi:ANZOLETO.Je sais bien que vous ne m'aimez pas, que vous ne m'aimerez jamais, etvoila pourquoi je suis triste et contraint aupres de vous.CORILLA.Et si je t'aimais?ANZOLETO.Je serais tout a fait desespere, parce qu'il me faudrait tomber du cieldans un abime, et vous perdre peut-etre une heure apres vous avoirconquise au prix de tout mon bonheur futur.CORILLA.Et qui te fait croire a tant d'inconstance de ma part?ANZELOTOD'abord, mon peu de merite. Ensuite, tout le mal qu'on dit de vous.CORILLA.Et qui donc medit ainsi de moi?ANZOLETO.Tous les hommes, parce que tous les hommes vous adorent.CORILLA.Ainsi, si j'avais la folie de prendre de l'affection pour toi et de tele dire, tu me repousserais?ANZOLETO.Je ne sais si j'aurais la force de m'enfuir; mais si je l'avais, il estcertain que je ne voudrais vous revoir de ma vie.--Eh bien, dit la Corilla, j'ai envie de faire cette epreuve parcuriosite.... Anzoleto, je crois que je t'aime.--Et moi, je n'en crois rien, repondit-il. Si je reste, c'est parce queje comprends bien que c'est un persiflage. A ce jeu-la, vous nem'intimiderez pas, et vous me piquerez encore moins.--Tu veux faire assaut de finesse, je crois?--Pourquoi non? Je ne suis pas bien redoutable, puisque je vous donne lemoyen de me vaincre.--Lequel?--C'est de me glacer d'epouvante, et de me mettre en fuite en me disantserieusement ce que vous venez de me dire par raillerie.--Tu es un drole de corps! et je vois bien qu'il faut faire attention atout avec toi. Tu es de ces hommes qui ne veulent pas respirer seulementle parfum de la rose, mais la cueillir et la mettre sous verre. Je net'aurais cru ni si hardi ni si volontaire a ton age!--Et vous me meprisez pour cela?--Au contraire: tu m'en plais davantage. Bonsoir, Anzoleto, nous nousreverrons.Elle lui tendit sa belle main, qu'il baisa avec passion. Je ne m'en suispas mal tire, se dit-il en fuyant sous les galeries qui bordaient lecanaletto.Desesperant de se faire ouvrir a cette heure indue le bouge ou il seretirait de coutume, il songea a s'aller etendre sur le premier seuilvenu, pour y gouter ce repos angelique que connaissent seules l'enfanceet la pauvrete. Mais, pour la premiere fois de sa vie, il ne trouva pasune dalle assez propre pour s'y coucher. Bien que le pave de Venise soitplus net et plus blanc que dans aucun autre lieu du monde, il s'enfallait de beaucoup que ce lit legerement poudreux convint a un habitnoir complet de la plus fine etoffe, et de la coupe la plus elegante. Etpuis la convenance! Les memes bateliers qui, le matin, enjambaienthonnetement les marches des escaliers sans heurter les haillons du jeuneplebeien, eussent insulte a son sommeil, et peut-etre souille a desseinles livrees de son luxe parasite etalees sous leurs pieds.Qu'eussent-ils pense d'un dormeur en plein air, en bas de soie, en lingefin, en manchettes et en rabat de dentelle? Anzoleto regretta en cemoment sa bonne cape de laine brune et rouge, bien fanee, bien usee,mais encore epaisse de deux doigts et a l'epreuve de la brume malsainequi s'eleve au matin sur les eaux de Venise. On etait aux derniers joursde fevrier; et bien qu'a cette epoque de l'annee le soleil soit dejabrillant et chaud dans ce climat, les nuits y sont encore tres-froides.L'idee lui vint d'aller se blottir dans quelque gondole amarree aurivage: toutes etaient fermees a cle. Enfin il en trouva une dont laporte ceda devant lui; mais en y penetrant il heurta les pieds dubarcarolle qui s'y etait retire pour dormir, et tomba sur lui.--Par lecorps du diable! lui cria une grosse voix rauque sortant du fond de cetantre, qui etes-vous, et que demandez-vous?--C'est toi, Zanetto? repondit Anzoleto en reconnaissant la voix dugondolier, assez bienveillant pour lui a l'ordinaire. Laisse-moi mecoucher a tes cotes, et faire un somme a couvert sous ta cabanette.--Et qui es-tu? demanda Zanetto.--Anzoleto; ne me reconnais-tu pas?--Par Satan, non! Tu portes des habits qu'Anzoleto ne pourrait porter, amoins qu'il ne les eut voles. Va-t'en, va-t'en! Fusses-tu le doge enpersonne, je n'ouvrirai pas ma barque a un homme qui a un bel habit pourse promener et pas un coin pour dormir.Jusqu'ici, pensa Anzoleto, la protection et les faveurs du comteZustiniani m'ont expose a plus de perils et de desagrements qu'elles nem'ont procure d'avantages. Il est temps que ma fortune reponde a messucces, et il me tarde d'avoir quelques sequins dans mes poches poursoutenir le personnage qu'on me fait jouer.Plein d'humeur, il se promena au hasard dans les rues desertes, n'osants'arreter de peur de faire rentrer la transpiration que la colere et lafatigue lui avaient causees. Pourvu qu'a tout ceci je ne gagne pas unenrouement! se disait-il. Demain monsieur le comte va vouloir faireentendre son jeune prodige a quelque sot aristarque, qui, si j'ai dansle gosier le moindre petit chat par suite d'une nuit sans repos, sanssommeil et sans abri, prononcera que je n'ai pas de voix; et monsieur lecomte, qui sait bien le contraire, dira: Ah! si vous l'aviez entenduhier!--Il n'est donc pas egal? dira l'autre. Peut-etre n'est-il pasd'une bonne sante?--Ou peut-etre, dira un troisieme, s'est-il fatiguehier. Il est bien jeune en effet pour chanter plusieurs jours de suite.Vous feriez bien d'attendre qu'il fut plus mur et plus robuste pour lelancer sur les planches.--Et le comte dira: Diable! s'il s'enroue pouravoir chante deux airs, ce n'est pas la mon affaire.--Alors, pours'assurer que j'ai de la force et de la sante, ils me feront faire desexercices tous les jours, jusqu'a perdre haleine, et ils me casseront lavoix pour s'assurer que j'ai des poumons. Au diable la protection desgrands seigneurs! Ah! quand pourrai-je m'en affranchir, et, fort de marenommee, de la faveur du public, de la concurrence des theatres, quandpourrai-je chanter dans leurs salons par grace, et traiter de puissancea puissance avec eux?En devisant ainsi avec lui-meme, Anzoleto arriva dans une de ces petitesplaces qu'on appelle _corti_ a Venise, bien que ce ne soient pas descours, et que cet assemblage de maisons, s'ouvrant sur un espace commun,corresponde plutot a ce que nous appelons aujourd'hui a Paris _cite_.Mais il s'en faut de beaucoup que la disposition de ces pretendues courssoit reguliere, elegante et soignee comme nos _squares_ modernes. Cesont plutot de petites places obscures, quelquefois formant impasse,d'autres fois servant de passage d'un quartier a l'autre; mais peufrequentees, habitees a l'entour par des gens de mince fortune et demince condition, le plus, souvent par des gens du peuple, des ouvriersou des blanchisseuses qui etendent leur linge sur des cordes tendues entravers du chemin, inconvenient que le passant supporte avec beaucoup detolerance, car son droit de passage est parfois tolere aussi plutot quefonde. Malheur a l'artiste pauvre, reduit a ouvrir les fenetres de soncabinet sur ces recoins tranquilles, ou la vie proletaire, avec seshabitudes rustiques, bruyantes et un peu malpropres, reparait tout acoup au sein de Venise, a deux pas des larges canaux et des somptueuxedifices. Malheur a lui, si le silence est necessaire a ses meditations;car de l'aube a la nuit un bruit d'enfants, de poules et de chiens,jouant et criant ensemble dans cette enceinte resserree, lesinterminables babillages des femmes rassemblees sur le seuil des portes,et les chansons des travailleurs dans leurs ateliers, ne lui laisserontpas un instant de repos. Heureux encore quand l'_improvisatore_ ne vientpas hurler ses sonnets et ses dithyrambes jusqu'a ce qu'il ait recueilliun sou de chaque fenetre, ou quand Brighella n'etablit pas sa baraque aumilieu de la cour, patient a recommencer son dialogue avec l'_avocato,il tedesco e il diavolo_, jusqu'a ce qu'il ait epuise en vain sa facondegratis devant les enfants deguenilles, heureux spectateurs qui ne sefont scrupule d'ecouter et de regarder sans avoir un liard dans leurpoche!Mais, la nuit, quand tout est rentre dans le silence, et que la lunepaisible eclaire et blanchit les dalles, cet assemblage de maisons detoutes les epoques, accolees les unes aux autres sans symetrie et sanspretention, coupees par de fortes ombres, pleines de mysteres dans leursenfoncements, et de grace instinctive dans leurs bizarreries, offre undesordre infiniment pittoresque. Tout devient beau sous les regards dela lune; le moindre effet d'architecture s'agrandit et prend ducaractere; le moindre balcon festonne de vigne se donne des airs deroman espagnol, et vous remplit l'imagination de ces belles aventuresdites de _cape et d'epee_. Le ciel limpide ou se baignent, au-dessus dece cadre sombre et anguleux, les pales coupoles des edifices lointains,verse sur les moindres details du tableau une couleur vague etharmonieuse qui porte a des reveries sans fin.C'est dans la _corte Minelli_, pres l'eglise San-Fantin, qu'Anzoleto setrouva au moment ou les horloges se renvoyaient l'une a l'autre le coupde deux heures apres minuit. Un instinct secret avait conduit ses pasvers la demeure d'une personne dont le nom et l'image ne s'etaient paspresentes a lui depuis le coucher du soleil. A peine etait-il rentredans cette cour, qu'il entendit une voix douce l'appeler bien bas parles dernieres syllabes de son nom; et, levant le tete, il vit une legeresilhouette se dessiner sur une des plus miserables terrasses del'enceinte. Un instant apres, la porte de cette masure s'ouvrit, etConsuelo en jupe d'indienne, et le corsage enveloppe d'une vieille mantede soie noire qui avait servi jadis de parure a sa mere, vint lui tendreune main, tandis qu'elle posait de l'autre un doigt sur ses levres pourlui recommander le silence. Ils monterent sur la pointe du pied et atatons l'escalier de bois tournant et delabre qui conduisait jusque surle toit; et quand ils furent assis sur la terrasse, ils commencerent unde ces longs chuchotements entrecoupes de baisers, que chaque nuit onentend murmurer sur les toits, comme des brises mysterieuses, ou commeun babillage d'esprits aeriens voltigeant par couples dans la brumeautour des cheminees bizarres qui coiffent de leurs nombreux turbansrouges toutes les maisons de Venise."Comment, ma pauvre amie, dit Anzoleto, tu m'as attendu jusqu'a present?--Ne m'avais-tu pas dit que tu viendrais me rendre compte de ta soiree?Eh bien, dis-moi donc si tu as bien chante, si tu as fait plaisir, si ont'a applaudi, si on t'a signifie ton engagement?--Et toi, ma bonne Consuelo, dit Anzoleto, penetre tout a coup deremords en voyant la confiance et la douceur de cette pauvre fille,dis-moi donc si tu t'es impatientee de ma longue absence, si tu n'es pasbien fatiguee de m'attendre ainsi, si tu n'as pas eu bien froid surcette terrasse, si tu as songe a souper, si tu ne m'en veux pas de venirsi tard, si tu as ete inquiete, si tu m'accusais?--Rien de tout cela, repondit-elle en lui jetant ses bras au cou aveccandeur. Si je me suis impatientee, ce n'est pas contre toi; si je suisfatiguee, si j'ai eu froid, je ne m'en ressens plus depuis que tu es la;si j'ai soupe je ne m'en souviens pas; si je t'ai accuse ... de quoit'aurais-je accuse? si j'ai ete inquiete ... pourquoi l'aurais-je ete?si je t'en veux? jamais.--Tu es un ange, toi! dit Anzoleto en l'embrassant. Ah! ma consolation!que les autres coeurs sont perfides et durs!--Helas! qu'est-il donc arrive? quel mal a-t-on fait la-bas au _fils demon ame?_ dit Consuelo, melant au gentil dialecte venitien lesmetaphores hardies et passionnees de sa langue natale.Anzoleto raconta tout ce qui lui etait arrive, meme ses galanteriesaupres de la Corilla, et surtout les agaceries qu'il en avait recues.Seulement, il raconta les choses d'une certaine facon, disant tout cequi ne pouvait affliger Consuelo, puisque, de fait et d'intention, illui avait ete fidele, et c'etait _presque_ toute la verite. Mais il y acentieme partie de verite que nulle enquete judiciaire n'a jamaiseclairee, que nul client n'a jamais confessee a son avocat, et que nularret n'a jamais atteinte qu'au hasard, parce que dans ce peu de faitsou d'intentions qui reste mysterieux, est la cause tout entiere, lemotif, le but, le mot enfin de ces grands proces toujours si mal plaideset toujours si mal juges, quelles que soient la passion des orateurs etla froideur des magistrats.Pour en revenir a Anzoleto, il n'est pas besoin de dire quellespeccadilles il passa sous silence, quelles emotions ardentes devant lepublic il traduisit a sa maniere, et quelles palpitations etouffees dansla gondole il oublia de mentionner. Je crois meme qu'il ne parla pointdu tout de la gondole, et qu'il rapporta ses flatteries a la cantatricecomme les adroites moqueries au moyen desquelles il avait echappe sansl'irriter aux perilleuses avances dont elle l'avait accable. Pourquoi,ne voulant pas et ne pouvant pas dire le fond des choses, c'est-a-direla puissance des tentations qu'il avait surmontees par prudence et paresprit de conduite, pourquoi, dites-vous, chere lectrice, ce jeunefourbe allait-il risquer d'eveiller la jalousie de Consuelo? Vous me ledemandez, Madame? Dites-moi donc si vous n'avez pas pour habitude deconter a l'amant, je veux dire a l'epoux de votre choix, tous leshommages dont vous avez ete entouree par les autres, tous les aspirantsque vous avez econduits, tous les rivaux que vous avez sacrifies, nonseulement avant l'hymen, mais apres, mais tous les jours de bal, maishier et ce matin encore! Voyons, Madame, si vous etes belle, comme je mecomplais a le croire, je gage ma tete que vous ne faites point autrementqu'Anzoleto, non pour vous faire valoir, non pour faire souffrir un amejalouse, non pour enorgueillir un coeur trop orgueilleux deja de vospreferences; mais parce qu'il est doux d'avoir pres de soi quelqu'un aqui l'on puisse raconter ces choses-la, tout en ayant l'air d'accomplirun devoir, et de se confesser en se vantant au confesseur. Seulement,Madame, vous ne vous confessez que de _presque tout_. Il n'y a qu'untout petit rien, dont vous ne parlez jamais; c'est le regard, c'est lesourire qui ont provoque l'impertinente declaration du presomptueux dontvous vous plaignez. Ce sourire, ce regard, ce rien, c'est precisement lagondole dont Anzoleto, heureux de repasser tout haut dans sa memoire lesenivrements de la soiree, oublia de parler a Consuelo. Heureusement pourla petite Espagnole, elle ne savait point encore ce que c'est que lajalousie: ce noir et amer sentiment ne vient qu'aux ames qui ontbeaucoup souffert, et jusque-la Consuelo etait aussi heureuse de sonamour qu'elle etait bonne. La seule circonstance qui fit en elle uneimpression profonde, ce fut l'oracle flatteur et severe prononce par sonrespectable maitre, le professeur Porpora, sur la tete adoreed'Anzoleto. Elle fit repeter a ce dernier les expressions dont le maitres'etait servi; et apres qu'il les lui eut exactement rapportees, elle ypensa longtemps et demeura silencieuse."Consuelina, lui dit Anzoleto sans trop s'apercevoir de sa reverie, jet'avoue que l'air est extremement frais. Ne crains-tu pas de t'enrhumer?Songe, ma cherie, que notre avenir repose sur ta voix encore plus quesur la mienne ...--Je ne m'enrhume jamais, repondit-elle; mais toi, tu es si peu vetuavec tes beaux habits! Tiens, enveloppe-toi de ma mantille.--Que veux-tu que je fasse de ce pauvre morceau de taffetas perce ajour? J'aimerais bien mieux me mettre a couvert une demi-heure dans tachambre.--Je le veux bien, dit Consuelo: mais alors il ne faudra pas parler; carles voisins pourraient nous entendre, et ils nous blameraient. Ils nesont pas mechants; ils voient nos amours sans trop me tourmenter, parcequ'ils savent bien que jamais tu n'entres chez moi la nuit. Tu feraismieux d'aller dormir chez toi.--Impossible! on ne m'ouvrira qu'au jour, et j'ai encore trois heures agrelotter. Tiens, mes dents claquent dans ma bouche.--En ce cas, viens, dit Consuelo en se levant; je t'enfermerai dans machambre, et je reviendrai sur la terrasse pour que, si quelqu'un nousobserve, il voie bien que je ne fais pas de scandale."--Elle le conduisit en effet dans sa chambre: c'etait une assez grandepiece delabree, ou les fleurs peintes a fresque sur les mursreparaissaient ca et la sous une seconde peinture encore plus grossiereet deja presque aussi degradee. Un grand bois de lit carre avec unepaillasse d'algues marines, et une couverture d'indienne piquee fortpropre, mais rapetassee en mille endroits avec des morceaux de toutescouleurs, une chaise de paille, une petite table, une guitare fortancienne, et un Christ de filigrane, uniques richesses que sa mere luiavait laissees; une petite epinette, et un gros tas de vieille musiquerongee des vers, que le professeur Porpora avait la generosite de luipreter: tel etait l'ameublement de la jeune artiste, fille d'une pauvreBohemienne, eleve d'un grand maitre et amoureuse d'un bel aventurier.Comme il n'y avait qu'une chaise, et que la table etait couverte demusique, il n'y avait qu'un siege pour Anzoleto; c'etait le lit, et ils'en accommoda sans facon. A peine se fut-il assis sur le bord, que lafatigue s'emparant de lui, il laissa tomber sa tete sur un gros coussinde laine qui servait d'oreiller, en disant:"Oh! ma chere petite femme, je donnerais en cet instant tout ce qui mereste d'annees a vivre pour une heure de bon sommeil, et tous lestresors de l'univers pour un bout de cette couverture sur mes jambes. Jen'ai jamais eu si froid que dans ces maudits habits, et le malaise decette insomnie me donne le frisson de la fievre."Consuelo hesita un instant. Orpheline et seule au monde a dix-huit ans,elle ne devait compte qu'a Dieu de ses actions. Croyant a la promessed'Anzoleto comme a la parole de l'Evangile, elle ne se croyait menaceeni de son degout ni de son abandon en cedant a tous ses desirs. Mais unsentiment de pudeur qu'Anzoleto n'avait jamais ni combattu ni altere enelle, lui fit trouver sa demande un peu grossiere. Elle s'approcha delui, et lui toucha la main. Cette main etait bien froide en effet, etAnzoleto prenant celle de Consuelo la porta a son front, qui etaitbrulant."Tu es malade! lui dit-elle, saisie d'une sollicitude qui fit tairetoutes les autres considerations. Eh bien, dors une heure sur ce lit."Anzoleto ne se le fit pas dire deux fois."Bonne comme Dieu meme!" murmura-t-il en s'etendant sur le matelasd'algue marine.Consuelo l'entoura de sa couverture; elle alla prendre dans un coinquelques pauvres hardes qui lui restaient, et lui en couvrit les pieds."Anzoleto, lui dit-elle a voix basse tout en remplissant ce soinmaternel, ce lit ou tu vas dormir, c'est celui ou j'ai dormi avec mamere les dernieres annees de sa vie; c'est celui ou je l'ai vue mourir,ou je l'ai enveloppee de son drap mortuaire, ou j'ai veille sur soncorps en priant et en pleurant, jusqu'a ce que la barque des morts soitvenue me l'oter pour toujours. Eh bien, je vais te dire maintenant cequ'elle m'a fait promettre a sa derniere heure. Consuelo, m'a-t-elle dit,jure-moi sur le Christ qu'Anzoleto ne prendra pas ma place dans ce litavant de s'etre marie avec toi devant un pretre.--Et tu as jure?--Et j'ai jure. Mais en te laissant dormir ici pour la premiere fois, cen'est pas la place de ma mere que je te donne, c'est la mienne.--Et toi, pauvre fille, tu ne dormiras donc pas? reprit Anzoleto en serelevant a demi par un violent effort. Ah! je suis un lache, je m'envais dormir dans la rue.--Non! dit Consuelo en le repoussant sur le coussin avec une douceviolence; tu es malade, et je ne le suis pas. Ma mere qui est morte enbonne catholique, et qui est dans le ciel, nous voit a toute heure. Ellesait que tu lui as tenu la promesse que tu lui avais faite de ne pasm'abandonner. Elle sait aussi que notre amour est aussi honnete depuissa mort qu'il l'a ete de son vivant. Elle voit qu'en ce moment je nefais et je ne pense rien de mal. Que son ame repose dans le Seigneur!"Ici Consuelo fit un grand signe de croix. Anzoleto etait deja endormi."Je vais dire mon chapelet la-haut sur la terrasse pour que tu n'aiespas la fievre," ajouta Consuelo en s'eloignant."Bonne comme Dieu!" repeta faiblement Anzoleto, et il ne s'apercutseulement pas que sa fiancee le laissait seul. Elle alla en effet direson chapelet sur le toit. Puis elle revint pour s'assurer qu'il n'etaitpas plus malade, et le voyant dormir paisiblement, elle contemplalongtemps avec recueillement son beau visage pale eclaire par la lune.Et puis, ne voulant pas ceder au sommeil elle-meme, et se rappelant queles emotions de la soiree lui avaient fait negliger son travail, elleralluma sa lampe, s'assit devant sa petite table, et nota un essai decomposition que maitre Porpora lui avait demande pour le jour suivant.VI.Le comte Zustiniani, malgre son detachement philosophique et denouvelles amours dont la Corilla feignait assez maladroitement d'etrejalouse, n'etait pas cependant aussi insensible aux insolents capricesde cette folle maitresse qu'il s'efforcait de le paraitre. Bon, faibleet frivole, Zustiniani n'etait roue que par ton et par position sociale.Il ne pouvait s'empecher de souffrir, au fond de son coeur, del'ingratitude avec laquelle cette fille avait repondu a sa generosite;et d'ailleurs, quoiqu'il fut a cette epoque (a Venise aussi bien qu'aParis) de la derniere inconvenance de montrer de la jalousie, l'orgueilitalien se revoltait contre le role ridicule et miserable que la Corillalui faisait jouer.Donc, ce meme soir ou Anzoleto avait brille au palais Zustiniani, lecomte, apres avoir agreablement plaisante avec son ami Barberigo sur lesespiegleries de sa maitresse, des qu'il vit ses salons deserts et lesflambeaux eteints, prit son manteau et son epee, et, pour en avoir _lecoeur net_, courut au palais qu'habitait la Corilla.Quand il se fut assure qu'elle etait bien seule, ne se trouvant pasencore tranquille, il entama la conversation a voix basse avec lebarcarolle qui etait en train de remiser la gondole de la prima-donnasous la voute destinee a cet usage. Moyennant quelques sequins, il lefit parler, et se convainquit bientot qu'il ne s'etait pas trompe ensupposant que la Corilla avait pris un compagnon de route dans sagondole. Mais il lui fut impossible de savoir qui etait ce compagnon; legondolier ne le savait pas. Bien qu'il eut vu cent fois Anzoleto auxalentours du theatre et du palais Zustiniani, il ne l'avait pas reconnudans l'ombre, sous l'habit noir et avec de la poudre.Ce mystere impenetrable acheva de donner de l'humeur au comte. Il se futconsole en persiflant son rival, seule vengeance de bon gout, mais aussicruelle dans les temps de parade que le meurtre l'est aux epoques depassions serieuses. Il ne dormit pas; et avant l'heure ou Porporacommencait son cours de musique au conservatoire des filles pauvres, ils'achemina vers la _scuola di Mendicanti_, dans la salle ou devaient serassembler les jeunes eleves.La position du comte a l'egard du docte professeur avait beaucoup changedepuis quelques annees. Zustiniani n'etait plus l'antagoniste musical dePorpora, mais son associe, et son chef en quelque sorte; il avait faitdes dons considerables a l'etablissement que dirigeait ce savant maitre,et par reconnaissance on lui en avait donne la direction supreme. Cesdeux amis vivaient donc desormais en aussi bonne intelligence quepouvait le permettre l'intolerance du professeur a l'egard de la musiquea la mode; intolerance qui cependant etait forcee de s'adoucir a la vuedes encouragements que le comte donnait de ses soins et de sa bourse al'enseignement et a la propagation de la musique serieuse. En outre, ilavait fait representer a San-Samuel un opera que ce maitre venait decomposer."Mon cher maitre, lui dit Zustiniani en l'attirant a l'ecart, il fautque non seulement vous vous decidiez a vous laisser enlever pour letheatre une de vos eleves, mais il faut encore que vous m'indiquiezcelle qui vous paraitra la plus propre a remplacer la Corilla. Cettecantatrice est fatiguee, sa voix se perd, ses caprices nous ruinent, lepublic est bientot degoute d'elle. Vraiment nous devons songer a luitrouver une _succeditrice_. (Pardon, cher lecteur, ceci se dit enitalien, et le comte ne faisait point un neologisme.)--Je n'ai pas ce qu'il vous faut, repliqua sechement Porpora.--Eh quoi, maitre, s'ecria le comte, allez-vous retomber dans voshumeurs noires? Est-ce tout de bon qu'apres tant de sacrifices et dedevouement de ma part pour encourager votre oeuvre musicale, vous vousrefusez a la moindre obligeance quand je reclame votre aide et vosconseils pour la mienne?--Je n'en ai plus de droit, comte, repondit le professeur; et ce que jeviens de vous dire est la verite, dite par un ami, et avec le desir devous obliger. Je n'ai point dans mon ecole de chant une seule personnecapable de vous remplacer la Corilla. Je ne fais pas plus de cas d'ellequ'il ne faut; mais en declarant que le talent de cette fille n'a aucunevaleur solide a mes yeux, je suis force de reconnaitre qu'elle possedeun savoir-faire, une habitude, une facilite et une communication etablieavec les sens du public qui ne s'acquierent qu'avec des annees depratique, et que n'auront pas de longtemps d'autres debutantes.--Cela est vrai, dit le comte; mais enfin nous avons forme la Corilla,nous l'avons vue commencer, nous l'avons fait accepter au public; sabeaute a fait les trois quarts de son succes, et vous avez d'aussicharmantes personnes dans votre ecole. Vous ne nierez pas cela, monmaitre! Voyons, confessez que la Clorinda est la plus belle creature del'univers!--Mais affectee, mais minaudiere, mais insupportable.... Il est vrai quele public trouvera peut-etre charmantes ces grimaces ridicules ... maiselle chante faux, elle n'a ni ame, ni intelligence.... Il est vrai quele public n'en a pas plus que d'oreilles ... mais elle n'a ni memoire,ni adresse, et elle ne se sauvera meme pas du _fiasco_ par lecharlatanisme heureux qui reussit a tant de gens!"En parlant ainsi, le professeur laissa tomber un regard involontaire surAnzoleto, qui, a la faveur de son titre de favori du comte, et souspretexte de venir lui parler, s'etait glisse dans la classe, et setenait a peu de distance, l'oreille ouverte a la conversation."N'importe, dit le comte sans faire attention a la malice rancuniere dumaitre; je n'abandonne pas mon idee. Il y a longtemps que je n'aientendu la Clorinda. Faisons-la venir, et avec elle cinq ou six autres,les plus jolies que l'on pourra trouver. Voyons, Anzoleto, ajouta-t-ilen riant, te voila assez bien equipe pour prendre l'air grave d'un jeuneprofesseur. Entre dans le jardin, et adresse-toi aux plus remarquablesde ces jeunes beautes, pour leur dire que nous les attendons ici,monsieur le professeur et moi."Anzoleto obeit; mais soit par malice, soit qu'il eut ses vues, il amenales plus laides, et c'est pour le coup que Jean-Jacques aurait pus'ecrier: "La Sofia etait borgne, la Cattina etait boiteuse."Ce quiproquo fut pris en bonne part, et, apres qu'on en eut ri souscape, on renvoya ces demoiselles avertir celles de leurs compagnes quedesigna le professeur. Un groupe charmant vint bientot, avec la belleClorinda au centre."La magnifique chevelure! dit le comte a l'oreille du professeur envoyant passer pres de lui les superbes tresses blondes de cettederniere.--Il y a beaucoup plus _dessus_ que _dedans_ cette tete, repondit lerude censeur sans daigner baisser la voix.Apres une heure d'epreuve, le comte, n'y pouvant plus tenir, se retiraconsterne en donnant des eloges pleins de graces a ces demoiselles, eten disant tout bas au professeur:--Il ne faut point songer a cesperruches!"Si votre seigneurie illustrissime daignait me permettre de dire un motsur ce qui la preoccupe ... articula doucement Anzoleto a l'oreille ducomte en descendant l'escalier.--Parle, reprit le comte; connaitrais-tu cette merveille que nouscherchons?--Oui, excellence.--Et au fond de quelle mer iras-tu pecher cette perle fine?--Tout au fond de la classe ou le malin professeur Porpora la tientcachee les jours ou vous passez votre bataillon feminin en revue.--Quoi? est-il dans la scuola un diamant dont mes yeux n'aient jamaisapercu l'eclat? Si maitre Porpora m'a joue un pareil tour!...--Illustrissime, le diamant dont je parle ne fait pas partie de lascuola. C'est une pauvre fille qui vient seulement chanter dans leschoeurs quand on a besoin d'elle, et a qui le professeur donne deslecons particulieres par charite, et plus encore par amour de l'art.--Il faut donc que cette pauvre fille ait des facultes extraordinaires;car le professeur n'est pas facile a contenter, et il n'est pas prodiguede son temps et de sa peine. L'ai-je entendue quelquefois sans laconnaitre?--Votre Seigneurie l'a entendue une fois, il y a bien longtemps, etlorsqu'elle n'etait encore qu'un enfant. Aujourd'hui c'est une grandejeune fille, forte, studieuse, savante comme le professeur, et capablede faire siffler la Corilla le jour ou elle chantera une phrase de troismesures a cote d'elle sur le theatre.--Et ne chante-t-elle jamais en public? Le professeur ne lui a-t-il pasfait dire quelques motets aux grandes vepres?--Autrefois, excellence, le professeur se faisait une joie de l'entendrechanter a l'eglise; mais depuis que les _scolari_, par jalousie et parvengeance, ont menace de la faire chasser de la tribune si elle yreparaissait a cote d'elles....--C'est donc une fille de mauvaise vie?...--O Dieu vivant! excellence, c'est une vierge aussi pure que la porte duciel! Mais elle est pauvre et de basse extraction ... comme moi,excellence, que vous daignez cependant elever jusqu'a vous par vosbontes; et ces mechantes harpies ont menace le professeur de se plaindrea vous de l'infraction qu'il commettait contre le reglement enintroduisant dans leur classe une eleve qui n'en fait point partie.--Ou pourrai-je donc entendre cette merveille?--Que votre seigneurie donne l'ordre au professeur de la faire chanterdevant elle; elle pourra juger de sa voix et de la grandeur de sontalent.--Ton assurance me donne envie de te croire. Tu dis donc que je l'aideja entendue, il y a longtemps ... J'ai beau chercher a me rappeler....--Dans l'eglise des Mendicanti, un jour de repetition generale, le_Salve Regina_ de Pergolese....--Oh! j'y suis, s'ecria le comte; une voix, un accent, une intelligenceadmirables!--Et elle n'avait que quatorze ans, monseigneur, c'etait un enfant.--Oui, mais ... je crois me rappeler qu'elle n'etait pas jolie.--Pas jolie, excellence! dit Anzoleto tout interdit.--Ne s'appelait-elle pas?... Oui, c'etait une Espagnole, un nombizarre....--Consuelo, monseigneur!--C'est cela, tu voulais l'epouser alors, et vos amours nous ont faitrire, le professeur et moi. Consuelo! c'est bien elle; la favorite duprofesseur, une fille bien intelligente, mais bien laide!--Bien laide! repeta Anzoleto stupefait.--Eh oui, mon enfant. Tu en es donc toujours epris?--C'est mon amie, illustrissime.--Amie veut dire chez nous egalement soeur et amante. Laquelle des deux?--Soeur, mon maitre.--Eh bien, je puis, sans te faire de peine, te dire ce que j'en pense.Ton idee n'a pas le sens commun. Pour remplacer la Corilla il faut unange de beaute, et ta Consuelo, je m'en souviens bien maintenant, estplus que laide, elle est affreuse."Le comte fut aborde en cet instant par un de ses amis, qui l'emmena d'unautre cote, et il laissa Anzoleto consterne se repeter ensoupirant:--Elle est affreuse!...VII.Il vous paraitra peut-etre etonnant, et il est pourtant tres certain,cher lecteur, que jamais Anzoleto n'avait eu d'opinion sur la beaute oula laideur de Consuelo. Consuelo etait un etre tellement isole,tellement ignore dans Venise, que nul n'avait jamais songe a cherchersi, a travers ce voile d'oubli et d'obscurite, l'intelligence et labonte avaient fini par se montrer sous une forme agreable ouinsignifiante. Porpora, qui n'avait plus de sens que pour l'art, n'avaitvu en elle que l'artiste. Les voisins de la _Corte-Minelli_ voyaientsans se scandaliser ses innocentes amours avec Anzoleto. A Venise onn'est point feroce sur ce chapitre-la. Ils lui predisaient bien parfoisqu'elle serait malheureuse avec ce garcon sans aveu et sans etat, et ilslui conseillaient de chercher plutot a s'etablir avec quelque honnete etpaisible ouvrier. Mais comme elle leur repondait qu'etant sans familleet sans appui elle-meme, Anzoleto lui convenait parfaitement; comme,depuis six ans, il ne s'etait pas ecoule un seul jour sans qu'on les vitensemble, ne cherchant point le mystere, et ne se querellant jamais, onavait fini par s'habituer a leur union libre et indissoluble. Aucunvoisin ne s'etait jamais avise de faire la cour a l'_amica_ d'Anzoleto.Etait-ce seulement a cause des engagements qu'on lui supposait, ou bienetait-ce a cause de sa misere? ou bien encore n'etait-ce pas que sapersonne n'avait exerce de seduction sur aucun d'eux? La dernierehypothese est fort vraisemblable.Cependant chacun sait que, de douze a quatorze ans, les jeunes fillessont generalement maigres, decontenancees, sans harmonie dans lestraits, dans les proportions, dans les mouvements. Vers quinze ans ellesse _refont_ (c'est en francais vulgaire l'expression des matrones); etcelle qui paraissait affreuse naguere reparait, apres ce court travailde transformation, sinon belle, du moins agreable. On a remarque memequ'il n'etait pas avantageux a l'avenir d'une fillette d'etre jolie detrop bonne heure.Consuelo ayant recueilli comme les autres le benefice de l'adolescence,on avait cesse de dire qu'elle etait laide; et le fait est qu'elle nel'etait plus. Seulement, comme elle n'etait ni dauphine, ni infante,elle n'avait point eu de courtisans autour d'elle pour proclamer que laroyale progeniture embellissait a vue d'oeil; et comme elle n'avait pasl'appui de tendres sollicitudes pour s'inquieter de son avenir, personnene prenait la peine de dire a Anzoleto: "Ta fiancee ne te fera pointrougir devant le monde."Si bien qu'Anzoleto l'avait entendu traiter de laideron a l'age ou cereproche n'avait pour lui ni sens ni valeur; et depuis qu'on ne disaitplus ni mal ni bien de la figure de Consuelo, il avait oublie de s'enpreoccuper. Sa vanite avait pris un autre essor. Il revait le theatre etla celebrite, et n'avait pas le temps de songer a faire etalage de sesconquetes. Et puis la grosse part de curiosite qui entre dans les desirsde la premiere jeunesse etait assouvie chez lui. J'ai dit qu'a dix-huitans il n'avait plus rien a apprendre. A vingt-deux ans, il etait quasiblase; et a vingt-deux ans comme a dix-huit, son attachement pourConsuelo etait aussi tranquille, en depit de quelques chastes baiserspris sans trouble et rendus sans honte, qu'il l'avait ete jusque-la.Pour qu'on ne s'etonne pas trop de ce calme et de cette vertu de la partd'un jeune homme qui ne s'en piquait point ailleurs, il faut faireobserver que la grande liberte dans laquelle nos adolescents vivaient aucommencement de cette histoire s'etait modifiee et peu a peu restreinteavec le temps. Consuelo avait pres de seize ans, et menait encore unevie un peu vagabonde, sortant du Conservatoire toute seule pour allerrepeter sa lecon et manger son riz sur les degres de la Piazzetta avecAnzoleto, lorsque sa mere, epuisee de fatigue, cessa de chanter le soirdans les cafes, une guitare a la main et une sebile devant elle. Lapauvre creature se retira dans un des plus miserables greniers de la_Corte-Minelli_, pour s'y eteindre a petit feu sur un grabat. Alors labonne Consuelo, ne voulant plus la quitter, changea tout a fait de genrede vie. Hormis les heures ou le professeur daignait lui donner sa lecon,elle travaillait soit a l'aiguille, soit au contre point, toujoursaupres du chevet de cette mere imperieuse et desesperee, qui l'avaitcruellement maltraitee dans son enfance, et qui maintenant lui donnaitl'affreux spectacle d'une agonie sans courage et sans vertu. La pietefiliale et le devouement tranquille de Consuelo ne se dementirent pas unseul instant. Joies de l'enfance, liberte, vie errante, amour meme, toutfut sacrifie sans amertume et sans hesitation. Anzoleto s'en plaignitvivement, et, voyant ses reproches inutiles, resolut d'oublier et de sedistraire; mais ce lui fut impossible. Anzoleto n'etait pas assidu autravail comme Consuelo; il prenait vite et mal les mauvaises lecons queson professeur, pour gagner le salaire promis par Zustiniani, luidonnait tout aussi mal et aussi vite. Cela etait fort heureux pourAnzoleto, en qui les prodigalites de la nature reparaient aussi bien quepossible le temps perdu et les effets d'un mauvais enseignement; mais ilen resultait bien des heures d'oisivete durant lesquelles la societefidele et enjouee de Consuelo lui manquait horriblement. Il tenta des'adonner aux passions de son age et de sa classe; il frequenta lescabarets, et joua avec les polissons les petites gratifications que luioctroyait de temps en temps le comte Zustiniani. Cette vie lui plut deuxou trois semaines, au bout desquelles il trouva que son bien-etre, sasante et sa voix s'alteraient sensiblement; que le _far-niente_ n'etaitpas le desordre, et que le desordre n'etait pas son element. Preservedes mauvaises passions par l'amour bien entendu de soi-meme, il seretira dans la solitude et s'efforca d'etudier; mais cette solitude luisembla effrayante de tristesse et de difficultes. Il s'apercut alors queConsuelo etait aussi necessaire a son talent qu'a son bonheur. Studieuseet perseverante, vivant dans la musique comme l'oiseau dans l'air et lepoisson dans l'eau, aimant a vaincre les difficultes sans se rendre plusde raison de l'importance de cette victoire qu'il n'appartient a unenfant, mais poussee fatalement a combattre les obstacles et a penetrerles mysteres de l'art, par cet invincible instinct qui fait que le germedes plantes cherche a percer le sein de la terre et a se lancer vers lejour, Consuelo avait une de ces rares et bienheureuses organisationspour lesquelles le travail est une jouissance, un repos veritable, unetat normal necessaire, et pour qui l'inaction serait une fatigue, undeperissement, un etat maladif, si l'inaction etait possible a de tellesnatures.Mais elles ne la connaissent pas; dans une oisivete apparente, ellestravaillent encore; leur reverie n'est point vague, c'est unemeditation. Quand on les voit agir, on croit qu'elles creent, tandisqu'elles manifestent seulement une creation recente.--Tu me diras, cherlecteur, que tu n'as guere connu de ces organisations exceptionnelles.Je te repondrai, lecteur bien-aime, que je n'en ai connu qu'une seule,et si, suis-je plus vieux que toi. Que ne puis-je te dire que j'aianalyse sur mon pauvre cerveau le divin mystere de cette activiteintellectuelle! Mais, helas! ami lecteur, ce n'est ni toi ni moi quietudierons sur nous-memes.Consuelo travaillait toujours, en s'amusant toujours; elle s'obstinaitdes heures entieres a vaincre, soit par le chant libre et capricieux,soit par la lecture musicale, des difficultes qui eussent rebuteAnzoleto livre a lui-meme; et sans dessein premedite, sans aucune ideed'emulation, elle le forcait a la suivre, a la seconder, a la comprendreet a lui repondre, tantot au milieu de ses eclats de rires enfantins,tantot emportee avec lui par cette _fantasia_ poetique et creatrice queconnaissent les organisations populaires en Espagne et en Italie. Depuisplusieurs annees qu'il s'etait impregne du genie de Consuelo, le buvanta sa source sans le comprendre, et se l'appropriant sans s'enapercevoir, Anzoleto, retenu d'ailleurs par sa paresse, etait devenu enmusique un etrange compose de savoir et d'ignorance, d'inspiration et defrivolite, de puissance et de gaucherie, d'audace et de faiblesse, quiavait plonge, a la derniere audition, le Porpora dans un dedale demeditations et de conjectures. Ce maitre ne savait point le secret detoutes ces richesses derobees a Consuelo; car ayant une fois severementgronde la petite de son intimite avec ce grand vaurien, il ne les avaitjamais revus ensemble. Consuelo, qui tenait a conserver les bonnesgraces de son professeur, avait eu soin de ne jamais se montrer devantlui en compagnie d'Anzoleto, et du plus loin qu'elle l'apercevait dansla rue, si Anzoleto etait avec elle, leste comme un jeune chat, elle secachait derriere une colonne ou se blottissait dans une gondole.Ces precautions continuerent lorsque Consuelo, devenue garde-malade, etAnzoleto ne pouvant plus supporter son absence, sentant la vie,l'espoir, l'inspiration et jusqu'au souffle lui manquer, revint partagersa vie sedentaire, et affronter avec elle tous les soirs les acretes etles emportements de la moribonde. Quelques mois avant d'en finir, cettemalheureuse femme perdit l'energie de ses souffrances, et, vaincue parla piete de sa fille, sentit son ame s'ouvrir a de plus douces emotions.Elle s'habitua a recevoir les soins d'Anzoleto, qui, malgre son peu devocation pour ce role de devouement, s'habitua de son cote a une sortede zele enjoue et de douceur complaisante envers la faiblesse et lasouffrance. Anzoleto avait le caractere egal et les manieresbienveillantes. Sa perseverance aupres d'elle et de Consuelo gagna enfinson coeur, et, a son heure derniere, elle leur fit jurer de ne sequitter jamais. Anzoleto le promit, et meme il eprouva en cet instantsolennel une sorte d'attendrissement serieux qu'il ne connaissait pasencore. La mourante lui rendit cet engagement plus facile en lui disant:Qu'elle soit ton amie, ta soeur, ta maitresse ou ta femme, puisqu'elle neconnait que toi et n'a jamais voulu ecouter que toi, ne l'abandonne pas.--Puis, croyant donner a sa fille un conseil bien habile et biensalutaire, sans trop songer s'il etait realisable ou non, elle lui avaitfait jurer en particulier, ainsi qu'on l'a vu deja, de ne jamaiss'abandonner a son amant avant la consecration religieuse du mariage.Consuelo l'avait jure, sans prevoir les obstacles que le caractereindependant et irreligieux d'Anzoleto pourrait apporter a ce projet.Devenue orpheline, Consuelo avait continue de travailler a l'aiguillepour vivre dans le present, et d'etudier la musique pour s'associer al'avenir d'Anzoleto. Depuis deux ans qu'elle vivait seule dans songrenier, il avait continue a la voir tous les jours, sans eprouver pourelle aucune passion, et sans pouvoir en eprouver pour d'autres femmes,tant la douceur de son intimite et l'_agrement de vivre aupres d'elle_lui semblaient preferables a tout.Sans se rendre compte des hautes facultes de sa compagne, il avaitacquis desormais assez de gout et de discernement pour savoir qu'elleavait plus de science et de moyens qu'aucune des cantatrices deSan-Samuel et que la Corilla elle-meme. A son affection d'habitudes'etait donc joint l'espoir et presque la certitude d'une associationd'interets, qui rendrait leur existence profitable et brillante avec letemps. Consuelo n'avait guere coutume de penser a l'avenir. Laprevoyance n'etait point au nombre de ses occupations d'esprit. Elle eutencore cultive la musique sans autre but que celui d'obeir a savocation; et la communaute d'interets que la pratique de cet art devaitetablir entre elle et son ami, n'avait pas d'autre sens pour elle quecelui d'association de bonheur et d'affection. C'etait donc sans l'enavertir qu'il avait concu tout a coup l'espoir de hater la realisationde leurs reves; et en meme temps que Zustiniani s'etait preoccupe duremplacement de la Corilla, Anzoleto, devinant avec une rare sagacite lasituation d'esprit de son patron, avait improvise la proposition qu'ilvenait de lui faire.Mais la laideur de Consuelo, cet obstacle inattendu etrange, invincible,si le comte ne se trompait pas, etait venu jeter l'effroi et laconsternation dans son ame. Aussi reprit-il le chemin de la_Corte-Minelli_, en s'arretant a chaque pas pour se representer sous unnouveau jour l'image de son amie, et pour repeter avec un pointd'interrogation a chaque parole: Pas jolie? bien laide? affreuse?VIII."Qu'as-tu donc a me regarder ainsi? lui dit Consuelo en le voyant entrerchez elle et la contempler d'un air etrange sans lui dire un mot. Ondirait que tu ne m'as jamais vue.--C'est la verite, Consuelo, repondit-il. Je ne t'ai jamais vue.--As-tu l'esprit egare? reprit-elle. Je ne sais pas ce que tu veux dire.--Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! je le crois bien, s'ecria Anzoleto. J'ai unegrande tache noire dans le cerveau a travers laquelle je ne te vois pas.--Misericorde! tu es malade, mon ami?--Non, chere fille, calme-toi, et tachons de voir clair. Dis-moi,Consuelita, est-ce que tu me trouves beau?--Mais certainement, puisque je t'aime.--Et si tu ne m'aimais pas, comment me trouverais-tu?--Est-ce que je sais?--Quand tu regardes d'autres hommes que moi, sais-tu s'ils sont beaux oulaids?--Oui; mais je te trouve plus beau que les plus beaux.--Est-ce parce que je le suis, ou parce que tu m'aimes?--Je crois bien que c'est l'un et l'autre. D'ailleurs tout le monde ditque tu es beau, et tu le sais bien. Mais qu'est-ce que cela te fait?--Je veux savoir si tu m'aimerais quand meme je serais affreux.--Je ne m'en apercevrais peut-etre pas.--Tu crois donc qu'on peut aimer une personne laide?--Pourquoi pas, puisque tu m'aimes?--Tu es donc laide, Consuelo? Vraiment, dis-moi, reponds-moi, tu es donclaide?--On me l'a toujours dit. Est-ce que tu ne le vois pas?--Non, non, en verite, je ne le vois pas!--En ce cas, je me trouve assez belle, et je suis bien contente.--Tiens, dans ce moment-ci, Consuelo, quand tu me regardes d'un air sibon, si naturel, si aimant, il me semble que tu es plus belle que laCorilla. Mais je voudrais savoir si c'est l'effet de mon illusion ou laverite. Je connais ta physionomie, je sais qu'elle est honnete etqu'elle me plait, et que quand je suis en colere elle me calme; quequand je suis triste, elle m'egaie; que quand je suis abattu, elle meranime. Mais je ne connais pas ta figure. Ta figure, Consuelo, je nepeux pas savoir si elle est laide.--Mais qu'est-ce que cela te fait, encore une fois?--Il faut que je le sache. Dis-moi si un homme beau pourrait aimer unefemme laide.--Tu aimais bien ma pauvre mere, qui n'etait plus qu'un spectre! Et moi,je l'aimais tant!--Et la trouvais-tu laide?--Non. Et toi?--Je n'y songeais pas. Mais aimer d'amour, Consuelo ... car enfin jet'aime d'amour, n'est-ce pas? Je ne peux pas me passer de toi, je nepeux pas te quitter. C'est de l'amour: que t'en semble?--Est-ce que cela pourrait etre autre chose?--Cela pourrait etre de l'amitie.--Oui, cela pourrait etre de l'amitie."Ici Consuelo surprise s'arreta, et regarda attentivement Anzoleto; etlui, tombant dans une reverie melancolique, se demanda positivement pourla premiere fois, s'il avait de l'amour ou de l'amitie pour Consuelo; sile calme de ses sens, si la chastete qu'il observait facilement aupresd'elle, etaient le resultat du respect ou de l'indifference. Pour lapremiere fois, il regarda cette jeune fille avec les yeux d'un jeunehomme, interrogeant, avec un esprit d'analyse qui n'etait pas sanstrouble, ce front, ces yeux, cette taille, et tous ces details dont iln'avait jamais saisi qu'une sorte d'ensemble ideal et comme voile danssa pensee. Pour la premiere fois, Consuelo interdite se sentit troubleepar le regard de son ami; elle rougit, son coeur battit avec violence,et ses yeux se detournerent, ne pouvant supporter ceux d'Anzoleto.Enfin, comme il gardait toujours le silence, et qu'elle n'osait plus lerompre, une angoisse inexprimable s'empara d'elle, de grosses larmesroulerent sur ses joues; et cachant sa tete dans ses mains:"Oh! je vois bien, dit-elle, tu viens me dire que tu ne veux plus de moipour ton amie.--Non, non! je n'ai pas dit cela! je ne le dis pas! s'ecria Anzoletoeffraye de ces larmes qu'il faisait couler pour la premiere fois; etvivement ramene a son sentiment fraternel, il entoura Consuelo de sesbras. Mais, comme elle detournait son visage, au lieu de sa joue fraicheet calme il baisa une epaule brulante que cachait mal un fichu de grossedentelle noire.Quand le premier eclair de la passion s'allume instantanement dans uneorganisation forte, restee chaste comme l'enfance au milieu dudeveloppement complet de la jeunesse, elle y porte un choc violent etpresque douloureux."Je ne sais ce que j'ai, dit Consuelo en s'arrachant des bras de son amiavec une sorte de crainte qu'elle n'avait jamais eprouvee; mais je mesens bien mal: il me semble que je vais mourir.--Ne meurs pas, lui, dit Anzoleto en la suivant et en la soutenant dansses bras; tu es belle, Consuelo, je suis sur que tu es belle."En effet, Consuelo etait belle en cet instant; et quoique Anzoleto n'enfut pas certain au point de vue de l'art, il ne pouvait s'empecher de ledire, parce que son coeur le sentait vivement."Mais enfin, lui dit Consuelo toute palie et tout abattue en un instant,pourquoi donc tiens-tu aujourd'hui a me trouver belle?--Ne voudrais-tu pas l'etre, chere Consuelo?--Oui, pour toi.--Et pour les autres?--Peu m'importe.--Et si c'etait une condition pour notre avenir?"Ici Anzoleto, voyant l'inquietude qu'il causait a son amie, lui rapportanaivement ce qui s'etait passe entre le comte et lui; et quand il envint a repeter les expressions peu flatteuses dont Zustiniani s'etaitservi en parlant d'elle, la bonne Consuelo qui peu a peu s'etaittranquillisee en croyant voir tout ce dont il s'agissait, partit d'ungrand eclat de rire en achevant d'essuyer ses yeux humides."Eh bien! lui dit Anzoleto tout surpris de cette absence totale devanite, tu n'es pas plus emue, pas plus inquiete que cela? Ah! je vois,Consuelina, vous etes une petite coquette; vous savez que vous n'etespas laide.--Ecoute, lui repondit-elle en souriant, puisque tu prends de pareillesfolies au serieux, il faut que je te tranquillise un peu. Je n'ai jamaisete coquette: n'etant pas belle, je ne veux pas etre ridicule. Maisquant a etre laide, je ne le suis plus.--Vraiment on te l'a dit? Qui t'a dit cela, Consuelo?--D'abord ma mere, qui ne s'est jamais tourmentee de ma laideur. Je luiai entendu dire souvent que cela se passerait, qu'elle avait ete encoreplus laide dans son enfance; et beaucoup de personnes qui l'avaientconnue m'ont dit qu'a vingt ans elle avait ete la plus belle fille deBurgos. Tu sais bien que quand par hasard quelqu'un la regardait dansles cafes ou elle chantait, on disait: Cette femme doit avoir ete belle.Vois-tu, mon pauvre ami, la beaute est comme cela quand on est pauvre;c'est un instant: on n'est pas belle encore, et puis bientot on ne l'estplus. Je le serai peut-etre, qui sait? si je peux ne pas me fatiguertrop, avoir du sommeil, et ne pas trop souffrir de la faim.--Consuelo, nous ne nous quitterons pas; bientot je serai riche, et tune manqueras de rien. Tu pourras donc etre belle a ton aise.--A la bonne heure. Que Dieu fasse le reste!--Mais tout cela ne conclut a rien pour le present, et il s'agit desavoir si le comte te trouvera assez belle pour paraitre au theatre.--Maudit comte! pourvu qu'il ne fasse pas trop le difficile!--D'abord, tu n'es pas laide.--Non, je ne suis pas laide. J'ai entendu, il n'y a pas longtemps, leverrotier qui demeure ici en face, dire a sa femme: Sais-tu que laConsuelo n'est pas vilaine? Elle a une belle taille, et quand elle rit,elle vous met tout le coeur en joie; et quand elle chante, elle paraitjolie.--Et qu'est-ce que la femme du verrotier a repondu?--Elle a repondu: Qu'est-ce que cela te fait, imbecile? Songe a tonouvrage; est-ce qu'un homme marie doit regarder les jeunes filles?--Paraissait-elle fachee?--Bien fachee.--C'est bon signe. Elle sentait que son mari ne se trompait pas. Et puisencore?--Et puis encore, la comtesse Mocenigo, qui me donne de l'ouvrage, etqui s'est toujours interessee a moi, a dit la semaine derniere audocteur Ancillo, qui etait chez elle au moment ou j'entrais: Regardezdonc, monsieur le docteur, comme cette _zitella_ a grandi, et comme elleest devenue blanche et bien faite!--Et qu'a repondu le docteur?--Il a repondu: C'est vrai, Madame, par Bacchus! Je ne l'aurais pasreconnue; elle est de la nature des flegmatiques, qui blanchissent enprenant un peu d'embonpoint. Ce sera une belle fille, vous verrez cela.--Et puis encore?--Et puis encore la superieure de Santa-Chiara, qui me fait faire desbroderies pour ses autels, et qui a dit a une de ses soeurs: Tenez,voyez si ce que je vous disais n'est pas vrai? La Consuelo ressemble anotre sainte Cecile. Toutes les fois que je fais ma priere devant cetteimage, je ne peux m'empecher de penser a cette petite; et alors je priepour elle, afin qu'elle ne tombe pas dans le peche, et qu'elle ne chantejamais que pour l'eglise.--Et qu'a repondu la soeur?--La soeur a repondu: C'est vrai, ma mere; c'est tout a fait vrai. Etmoi j'ai ete bien vite dans leur eglise, et j'ai regarde la sainteCecile qui est d'un grand maitre, et qui est belle, bien belle!--Et qui te ressemble?--Un peu.--Et tu ne m'as jamais dit cela?--Je n'y ai pas pense.--Chere Consuelo, tu es donc belle?--Je ne crois pas; mais je ne suis plus si laide qu'on le disait. Cequ'il y a de sur, c'est qu'on ne me le dit plus. Il est vrai que c'estpeut-etre parce qu'on s'imagine que cela me ferait de la peine apresent.--Voyons, Consuelina, regarde-moi bien. Tu as les plus beaux yeux dumonde, d'abord!--Mais la bouche est grande, dit Consuelo en riant et en prenant unpetit morceau de miroir casse qui lui servait de _psyche_, pour seregarder.--Elle n'est pas petite; mais quelles belles dents! reprit Anzoleto; cesont des perles fines, et tu les montres toutes quand tu ris.--En ce cas tu me diras quelque chose qui me fasse rire, quand nousserons devant le comte.--Tu as des cheveux magnifiques, Consuelo.--Pour cela oui! Veux-tu les voir?" Elle detacha ses epingles, et laissatomber jusqu'a terre un torrent de cheveux noirs, ou le soleil brillacomme dans une glace."Et tu as la poitrine large, la ceinture fine, les epaules ... ah! bienbelles, Consuelo! Pourquoi me les caches-tu? Je ne demande a voir que cequ'il faudra bien que tu montres au public.--J'ai le pied assez petit, dit Consuelo pour detourner laconversation;" et elle montra un veritable petit pied andaloux, beaute apeu pres inconnue a Venise."La main est charmante aussi, dit Anzoleto en baisant, pour la premierefois, la main que jusque la il avait serree amicalement comme celle d'uncamarade. Laisse-moi voir tes bras.--Tu les as vus cent fois, dit-elle en otant ses mitaines.--Non, je ne les avais jamais vus, dit Anzoleto que cet examen innocentet dangereux commencait a agiter singulierement."Et il retomba dans le silence, couvant du regard cette jeune fille quechaque coup d'oeil embellissait et transformait a ses yeux.Peut-etre n'etait-ce pas tout a fait qu'il eut ete aveugle jusqu'alors;car peut-etre etait-ce la premiere fois que Consuelo depouillait, sansle savoir, cet air insouciant qu'une parfaite regularite de lignes peutseule faire accepter. En cet instant, emue encore d'une vive atteinteportee a son coeur, redevenue naive et confiante, mais conservant unimperceptible embarras qui n'etait pas l'eveil de la coquetterie, maiscelui de la pudeur sentie et comprise, son teint avait une paleurtransparente, et ses yeux un eclat pur et serein qui la faisaientressembler certainement a la sainte Cecile des nones de Santa-Chiara.Anzoleto n'en pouvait plus detacher ses yeux. Le soleil s'etait couche;la nuit se faisait vite dans cette grande chambre eclairee d'une seulepetite fenetre; et dans cette demi-teinte, qui embellissait encoreConsuelo, semblait nager autour d'elle un fluide d'insaisissablesvoluptes. Anzoleto eut un instant la pensee de s'abandonner aux desirsqui s'eveillaient en lui avec une impetuosite toute nouvelle, et a cetentrainement se joignait par eclairs une froide reflexion. Il songeait aexperimenter, par l'ardeur de ses transports, si la beaute de Consueloaurait autant de puissance sur lui que celle des autres femmes reputeesbelles qu'il avait possedees. Mais il n'osa pas se livrer a cestentations indignes de celle qui les inspirait. Insensiblement sonemotion devint plus profonde, et la crainte d'en perdre les etrangesdelices lui fit desirer de la prolonger.Tout a coup, Consuelo, ne pouvant plus supporter son embarras se leva,et faisant un effort sur elle-meme pour revenir a leur enjouement, semit a marcher dans la chambre, en faisant de grands gestes de tragedie,et en chantant d'une maniere un peu outree plusieurs phrases de dramelyrique, comme si elle fut entree en scene."Eh bien, c'est magnifique! s'ecria Anzoleto ravi de surprise en lavoyant capable d'un charlatanisme qu'elle ne lui avait jamais montre.--Ce n'est pas magnifique, dit Consuelo en se rasseyant; et j'espere quec'est pour rire que tu dis cela?--Ce serait magnifique a la scene. Je t'assure qu'il n'y aurait rien detrop. Corilla en creverait de jalousie; car c'est tout aussi frappantque ce qu'elle fait dans les moments ou on l'applaudit a tout rompre.--Mon cher Anzoleto, repondit Consuelo, je ne voudrais pas que laCorilla crevat de jalousie pour de semblables jongleries, et si lepublic m'applaudissait parce que je sais la singer, je ne voudrais plusreparaitre devant lui.--Tu feras donc mieux encore?--Je l'espere, ou bien je ne m'en melerai pas.--Eh bien, comment feras-tu?--Je n'en sais rien encore.--Essaie.--Non; car tout cela, c'est un reve, et avant que l'on ait decide si jesuis laide ou non, il ne faut pas que nous fassions tant de beauxprojets. Peut-etre que nous sommes fous dans ce moment, et que, commel'a dit M. le comte, la Consuelo est affreuse."Cette derniere hypothese rendit a Anzoleto la force de s'en aller.IX.A cette epoque de sa vie, a peu pres inconnue des biographes, un desmeilleurs compositeurs de l'Italie et le plus grand professeur de chantdu dix-huitieme siecle, l'eleve de Scarlatti, le maitre de Hasse, deFarinelli, de Cafarelli, de la Mingotti, de Salimbini, de Hubert (dit le_Porporino_), de la Gabrielli, de la Molteni, en un mot le pere de laplus celebre ecole de chant de son temps, Nicolas Porpora, languissaitobscurement a Venise, dans un etat voisin de la misere et du desespoir.Il avait dirige cependant naguere, dans cette meme ville, leConservatoire de l'_Ospedaletto_, et cette periode de sa vie avait etebrillante. Il y avait ecrit et fait chanter ses meilleurs operas, sesplus belles cantates, et ses principaux ouvrages de musique d'eglise.Appele a Vienne en 1728, il y avait conquis, apres quelque combat, lafaveur de l'empereur Charles VI. Favorise aussi a la cour de Saxe[1],Porpora avait ete appele ensuite a Londres, ou il avait eu la gloire derivaliser pendant neuf ou dix ans avec Handel, le maitre des maitres,dont l'etoile palissait a cette epoque. Mais le genie de ce dernierl'avait emporte enfin, et le Porpora, blesse dans son orgueil ainsi quemaltraite dans sa fortune, etait revenu a Venise reprendre sans bruit etnon sans peine la direction d'un autre conservatoire. Il y ecrivaitencore des operas: mais c'est avec peine qu'il les faisait representer;et le dernier, bien que compose a Venise, fut joue a Londres ou il n'eutpoint de succes. Son genie avait recu ces profondes atteintes dont lafortune et la gloire eussent pu le relever; mais l'ingratitude de Hasse,de Farinelli, et de Cafarelli, qui l'abandonnerent de plus en plus,acheva de briser son coeur, d'aigrir son caractere et d'empoisonner savieillesse. On sait qu'il est mort miserable et desole, dans saquatre-vingtieme annee, a Naples.[1 Il donna des lecons de chant et de composition a la princesseelectorale de Saxe, qui fut depuis, en France, la _Grande Dauphine_,mere de Louis XVI, de Louis XVIII et de Charles X.]A l'epoque ou le comte Zustiniani, prevoyant et desirant presque ladefection de Corilla, cherchait a remplacer cette cantatrice, le Porporaetait en proie a de violents acces d'humeur atrabilaire, et son depitn'etait pas toujours mal fonde; car si l'on aimait et si l'on chantait aVenise la musique de Jomelli, de Lotti, de Carissimi, de Gasparini, etd'autres excellents maitres, on y prisait sans discernement la musiquebouffe de Cocchi, del Buini, de Salvator Apollini, et d'autrescompositeurs plus ou moins indigenes, dont le style commun et facileflattait le gout des esprits mediocres. Les operas de Hasse ne pouvaientplaire a son maitre, justement irrite. Le respectable et malheureuxPorpora, fermant son coeur et ses oreilles a la musique des modernes,cherchait donc a les ecraser sous la gloire et l'autorite des anciens.Il etendait sa reprobation trop severe jusque sur les gracieusescompositions de Galoppi, et jusque sur les originales fantaisies duChiozzetto, le compositeur populaire de Venise. Enfin il ne fallait pluslui parler que du pere Martini, de Durante, de Monteverde, dePalestrina; j'ignore si Marcello et Leo trouvaient grace devant lui. Cefut donc froidement et tristement qu'il recut les premieres ouverturesdu comte Zustiniani concernant son eleve inconnue, la pauvre Consuelo,dont il desirait pourtant le bonheur et la gloire; car il etait tropexperimente dans le professorat pour ne pas savoir tout ce qu'ellevalait, tout ce qu'elle meritait. Mais a l'idee de voir profaner cetalent si pur et si fortement nourri de la manne sacree des vieuxmaitres, il baissa la tete d'un air consterne, et repondit au comte:"Prenez-la donc, cette ame sans tache, cette intelligence sanssouillure; jetez-la aux chiens, et livrez-la aux betes, puisque telleest la destinee du genie au temps ou nous sommes."Cette douleur a la fois serieuse et comique donna au comte une idee dumerite de l'eleve, par le prix qu'un maitre si rigide y attachait."Eh quoi, mon cher maestro, s'ecria-t-il, est-ce la en effet votreopinion? La Consuelo est-elle un etre aussi extraordinaire, aussi divin?--Vous l'entendrez, dit le Porpora d'un air resigne; et il repeta: C'estsa destinee!"Cependant le comte vint a bout de relever les esprits abattus du maitre,en lui faisant esperer une reforme serieuse dans le choix des operasqu'il mettrait au repertoire de son theatre. Il lui promit l'exclusiondes mauvais ouvrages, aussitot qu'il aurait expulse la Corilla, sur lecaprice de laquelle il rejeta leur admission et leur succes. Il fit memeentendre adroitement qu'il serait tres sobre de Hasse, et declara que sile Porpora voulait ecrire un opera pour Consuelo, le jour ou l'elevecouvrirait son maitre d'une double gloire en exprimant sa pensee dans lestyle qui lui convenait, ce jour serait celui du triomphe lyrique de SanSamuel et le plus beau de la vie du comte.Le Porpora, vaincu, commenca donc a se radoucir, et a desirersecretement le debut de son eleve autant qu'il l'avait redoute jusquela, craignant de donner avec elle une nouvelle vogue aux ouvrages de sonrival. Mais comme le comte lui exprimait ses inquietudes sur la figurede Consuelo, il refusa de la lui faire entendre en particulier et al'improviste."Je ne vous dirai point, repondait-il a ses questions et a sesinstances, que ce soit une beaute. Une fille aussi pauvrement vetue, ettimide comme doit l'etre, en presence d'un seigneur et d'un juge devotre sorte, un enfant du peuple qui n'a jamais ete l'objet de lamoindre attention, ne saurait se passer d'un peu de toilette et depreparation. Et puis la Consuelo est de celles que l'expression du genierehausse extraordinairement. Il faut la voir et l'entendre en memetemps. Laissez-moi faire: si vous n'en etes pas content, vous me lalaisserez, et je trouverai bien moyen d'en faire une bonne religieuse,qui fera la gloire de l'ecole, en formant des eleves sous sa direction."Tel etait en effet l'avenir que jusque la le Porpora avait reve pourConsuelo.Quand il revit son eleve, il lui annonca qu'elle aurait a etre entendueet jugee par le comte. Mais comme elle lui eprima naivement sa crainted'etre trouvee laide, il lui fit croire qu'elle ne serait point vue, etqu'elle chanterait derriere la tribune grillee de l'orgue, le comteassistant a l'office dans l'eglise. Seulement il lui recommanda des'habiller decemment, parce qu'elle aurait a etre presentee ensuite a ceseigneur; et, bien qu'il fut pauvre aussi, le noble maitre, il lui donnaquelque argent a cet effet. Consuelo, tout interdite, tout agitee,occupee pour la premiere fois du soin de sa personne, prepara donc a lahate sa toilette et sa voix; elle essaya vite la derniere, et latrouvant si fraiche, si forte, si souple, elle repeta plus d'une fois aAnzoleto, qui l'ecoutait avec emotion et ravissement: "Helas! pourquoifaut-il donc quelque chose de plus a une cantatrice que de savoirchanter?"X.La veille du jour solennel, Anzoleto trouva la porte de Consuelo fermeeau verrou, et, apres qu'il eut attendu presque un quart d'heure surl'escalier, il fut admis enfin a voir son amie revetue de sa toilette defete, dont elle avait voulu faire l'epreuve devant lui. Elle avait unejolie robe de toile de Perse a grandes fleurs, un fichu de dentelles, etde la poudre. Elle etait si changee ainsi, qu'Anzoleto resta quelquesinstants incertain, ne sachant si elle avait gagne ou perdu a cettetransformation. L'irresolution que Consuelo lut dans ses yeux fut pourelle un coup de poignard."Ah! tiens, s'ecria-t-elle, je vois bien que je ne te plais pas ainsi. Aqui donc semblerai-je supportable, si celui qui m'aime n'eprouve riend'agreable en me regardant?--Attends donc un peu, repondit Anzoleto; d'abord je suis frappe de tabelle taille dans ce long corsage, et de ton air distingue sous cesdentelles. Tu portes a merveille les larges plis de ta jupe. Mais jeregrette tes cheveux noirs ... du moins je le crois.... Mais c'est latenue du peuple, et il faut que tu sois demain une signora.--Et pourquoi faut-il que je sois une signora? Moi, je hais cette poudrequi affadit, et qui vieillit les plus belles. J'ai l'air empruntee sousces falbalas; en un mot, je me deplais ainsi, et je vois que tu es demon avis. Tiens, j'ai ete ce matin a la repetition, et j'ai vu laClorinda qui essayait aussi une robe neuve. Elle etait si pimpante, sibrave, si belle (oh! celle-la est heureuse, et il ne faut pas laregarder deux fois pour s'assurer de sa beaute), que je me sens effrayeede paraitre a cote d'elle devant le comte.--Sois tranquille, le comte l'a vue; mais il l'a entendue aussi.--Et elle a mal chante?--Comme elle chante toujours.--Ah! mon ami, ces rivalites gatent le coeur. Il y a quelque temps si laClorinda, qui est une bonne fille malgre sa vanite, eut fait _fiasco_devant un juge, je l'aurais plainte du fond de l'ame, j'aurais partagesa peine et son humiliation. Et voila qu'aujourd'hui je me surprends am'en rejouir! Lutter, envier, chercher a se detruire mutuellement; ettout cela pour un homme qu'on n'aime pas, qu'on ne connait pas! Je mesens affreusement triste, mon cher amour, et il me semble que je suisaussi effrayee de l'idee de reussir que de celle d'echouer. Il me sembleque notre bonheur prend fin, et que demain apres l'epreuve, quellequ'elle soit, je rentrerai dans cette pauvre chambre, tout autre que jen'y ai vecu jusqu'a present.Deux grosses larmes roulerent sur les joues de Consuelo."Eh bien, tu vas pleurer, a present? s'ecria Anzoleto. Y songes-tu? tuvas ternir tes yeux et gonfler tes paupieres? Tes yeux, Consuelo! ne vapas gater tes yeux, qui sont ce que tu as de plus beau.--Ou de moins laid! dit-elle en essuyant ses larmes. Allons, quand on sedonne au monde, on n'a meme pas le droit de pleurer."Son ami s'efforca de la consoler, mais elle fut amerement triste tout lereste du jour; et le soir, lorsqu'elle se retrouva seule, elle otasoigneusement sa poudre, decrepa et lissa ses beaux cheveux d'ebene,essaya une petite robe de soie noire encore fraiche qu'elle mettaitordinairement le dimanche, et reprit confiance en elle-meme en seretrouvant devant sa glace telle qu'elle se connaissait. Puis elle fitsa priere avec ferveur, songea a sa mere, s'attendrit, et s'endormit enpleurant. Lorsque Anzoleto vint la chercher le lendemain pour laconduire a l'eglise, il la trouva a son epinette, habillee et peigneecomme tous les dimanches, et repassant son morceau d'epreuve."Eh quoi! s'ecria-t-il, pas encore coiffee, pas encore paree! L'heureapproche. A quoi songes-tu, Consuelo?--Mon ami, repondit-elle avec resolution, je suis paree, je suiscoiffee, je suis tranquille. Je veux rester ainsi. Ces belles robes neme vont pas. Mes cheveux noirs te plaisent mieux que la poudre. Cecorsage ne gene pas ma respiration. Ne me contredis pas: mon parti estpris. J'ai demande a Dieu de m'inspirer, et a ma mere de veiller sur maconduite. Dieu m'a inspire d'etre modeste et simple. Ma mere est venueme voir en reve, et elle m'a dit ce qu'elle me disait toujours:Occupe-toi de bien chanter, la Providence fera le reste. Je l'ai vue quiprenait ma belle robe, mes dentelles et mes rubans, et qui les rangeaitdans l'armoire; apres quoi, elle a place ma robe noire et ma mantille demousseline blanche sur la chaise a cote de mon lit. Aussitot que j'aiete eveillee, j'ai serre la toilette comme elle l'avait fait dans monreve, et j'ai mis la robe noire et la mantille: me voila prete. Je mesens du courage depuis que j'ai renonce a plaire par des moyens dont jene sais pas me servir. Tiens, ecoute ma voix, tout est la, vois-tu."Elle fit un trait."Juste ciel! nous sommes perdus! s'ecria Anzoleto; ta voix est voilee,et tes yeux sont rouges. Tu as pleure hier soir, Consuelo; voila unebelle affaire! Je te dis que nous sommes perdus, que tu es folle avecton caprice de t'habiller de deuil un jour de fete; cela porte malheuret cela t'enlaidit. Et vite, et vite! reprends ta belle robe, pendantque j'irai t'acheter du rouge. Tu es pale comme un spectre."Une discussion assez vive s'eleva entre eux a ce sujet. Anzoleto fut unpeu brutal. Le chagrin rentra dans l'ame de la pauvre fille; ses larmescoulerent encore. Anzoleto s'en irrita davantage, et, au milieu dudebat, l'heure sonna, l'heure fatale, le quart avant deux heures, justele temps de courir a l'eglise, et d'y arriver en s'essoufflant. Anzoletomaudit le ciel par un jurement energique. Consuelo, plus pale et plustremblante que l'etoile du matin qui se mire au sein des lagunes, seregarda une derniere fois dans sa petite glace brisee: puis seretournant, elle se jeta impetueusement dans les bras d'Anzoleto."O mon ami, s'ecria-t-elle, ne me gronde pas, ne me maudis pas.Embrasse-moi bien fort, au contraire, pour oter a mes joues cette paleurlivide. Que ton baiser soit comme le feu de l'autel sur les levresd'Isaie, et que Dieu ne nous punisse pas d'avoir doute de son secours!"Alors, elle jeta vivement sa mantille sur sa tete, prit ses cahiers, et,entrainant son amant consterne, elle courut aux Mendiant, ou deja lafoule etait rassemblee pour entendre la belle musique du Porpora.Anzoleto, plus mort que vif, alla joindre le comte, qui lui avait donnerendez-vous dans sa tribune; et Consuelo monta a celle de l'orgue, oules choeurs etaient deja en rang de bataille et le professeur devant sonpupitre. Consuelo ignorait que la tribune du comte etait situee demaniere a ce qu'il vit beaucoup moins dans l'eglise que dans la tribunede l'orgue, que deja il avait les yeux sur elle, et qu'il ne perdait pasun de ses mouvements.Mais il ne pouvait pas encore distinguer ses traits; car elles'agenouilla en arrivant, cacha sa tete dans ses mains, et se mit aprier avec une devotion ardente. Mon Dieu, disait-elle du fond de soncoeur, tu sais que je ne te demande point de m'elever au-dessus de mesrivales pour les abaisser. Tu sais que je ne veux pas me donner au mondeet aux arts profanes pour abandonner ton amour et m'egarer dans lessentiers du vice. Tu sais que l'orgueil n'enfle pas mon ame, et quec'est pour vivre avec celui que ma mere m'a permis d'aimer, pour ne m'enseparer jamais, pour assurer sa joie et son bonheur, que je te demandede me soutenir et d'ennoblir mon accent et ma pensee quand je chanteraites louanges.Lorsque les premiers accords de l'orchestre appelerent Consuelo a saplace, elle se releva lentement; sa mantille tomba sur ses epaules, etson visage apparut enfin aux spectateurs inquiets et impatients de latribune voisine. Mais quelle miraculeuse transformation s'etait opereedans cette jeune fille tout a l'heure si bleme et si abattue, si effareepar la fatigue et la crainte! Son large front semblait nager dans unfluide celeste, une molle langueur baignait encore les plans doux etnobles de sa figure sereine et genereuse. Son regard calme n'exprimaitaucune de ces petites passions qui cherchent et convoitent les succesordinaires. II y avait en elle quelque chose de grave, de mysterieux etde profond, qui commandait le respect et l'attendrissement."Courage, ma fille, lui dit le professeur a voix basse; tu vas chanterla musique d'un grand maitre, et ce maitre est la qui t'ecoute.--Qui, Marcello? dit Consuelo voyant le professeur deplier les psaumesde Marcello sur le pupitre.--Oui, Marcello, repondit le professeur. Chante comme a l'ordinaire,rien de plus, rien de moins, et ce sera bien."En effet, Marcello, alors dans la derniere annee de sa vie, etait venurevoir une derniere fois Venise, sa patrie, dont il faisait la gloirecomme compositeur, comme ecrivain, et comme magistrat. Il avait eteplein de courtoisie pour le Porpora, qui l'avait prie d'entendre sonecole, lui menageant la surprise de faire chanter d'abord par Consuelo,qui le possedait parfaitement, son magnifique psaume: _I cieli immensinarrano_. Aucun morceau n'etait mieux approprie a l'espece d'exaltationreligieuse ou se trouvait en ce moment l'ame de cette noble fille.Aussitot que les premieres paroles de ce chant large et franc brillerentdevant ses yeux, elle se sentit transportee dans un autre monde.Oubliant le comte Zustiniani, les regards malveillants de ses rivales,et jusqu'a Anzoleto, elle ne songea qu'a Dieu et a Marcello, qui seplacait dans sa pensee comme un interprete entre elle et ces cieuxsplendides dont elle avait a celebrer la gloire. Quel plus beau theme,en effet, et quelle plus grande idee!    I cieli immensi narrano    Del grande Iddio la gloria;    Il firmamento lucido    All'universo annunzia    Quanto sieno mirabili    Della sua destra le opere.Un feu divin monta a ses joues, et la flamme sacree jaillit de sesgrands yeux noirs, lorsqu'elle remplit la voute de cette voix sans egaleet de cet accent victorieux, pur, vraiment grandiose, qui ne peut sortirque d'une grande intelligence jointe a un grand coeur. Au bout dequelques mesures d'audition, un torrent de larmes delicieuses s'echappades yeux de Marcello. Le comte, ne pouvant maitriser son emotion,s'ecria:"Par tout le sang du Christ, cette femme est belle! C'est sainte Cecile,sainte Therese, sainte Consuelo! c'est la poesie, c'est la musique,c'est la foi personnifiees!"Quant a Anzoleto, qui s'etait leve et qui ne se soutenait plus sur sesjambes flechissantes que grace a ses mains crispees sur la grille de latribune, il retomba suffoque sur son siege, pret a s'evanouir et commeivre de joie et d'orgueil.Il fallut tout le respect du au lieu saint pour que les nombreuxdilettanti et la foule qui remplissait l'eglise n'eclatassent point enapplaudissements frenetiques, comme s'ils eussent ete au theatre. Lecomte n'eut pas la patience d'attendre la fin des offices pour passer al'orgue, et pour exprimer son enthousiasme au Porpora et a Consuelo. Ilfallut que, pendant la psalmodie des officiants, elle allat recevoir,dans la tribune du comte, les eloges et les remerciements de Marcello.Elle le trouva encore si emu qu'il pouvait a peine lui parler."Ma fille, lui dit-il d'une voix entrecoupee, recois les actions degrace et les benedictions d'un mourant. Tu viens de me faire oublier enun instant des annees de souffrance mortelle. Il me semble qu'un miracles'est opere en moi, et que ce mal incessant, epouvantable, s'est dissipepour toujours au son de ta voix. Si les anges de la-haut chantent commetoi, j'aspire a quitter la terre pour aller gouter une eternite desdelices que tu viens de me faire connaitre. Sois donc benie, enfant, etque ton bonheur en ce monde reponde a tes merites. J'ai entendu laFaustina, la Romanina, la Cuzzoni, toutes les plus grandes cantatricesde l'univers; elles ne te vont pas a la cheville. Il t'est reserve defaire entendre au monde ce que le monde n'a jamais entendu, et de luifaire sentir ce que nul homme n'a jamais senti."La Consuelo, aneantie et comme brisee sous cet eloge magnifique, courbala tete, mit presque un genou en terre, et sans pouvoir dire un mot,porta a ses levres la main livide de l'illustre moribond; mais en serelevant, elle laissa tomber sur Anzoleto un regard qui semblait luidire: Ingrat, tu ne m'avais pas devinee!XI.Durant le reste de l'office, Consuelo deploya une energie et desressources qui repondirent a toutes les objections qu'eut pu faireencore le comte Zustiniani. Elle conduisit, soutint et anima leschoeurs, faisant tour a tour chaque partie et montrant ainsi l'etendueprodigieuse et les qualites diverses de sa voix, plus la forceinepuisable de ses poumons, ou pour mieux dire la perfection de sascience; car qui sait chanter ne se fatigue pas, et Consuelo chantaitavec aussi peu d'effort et de travail que les autres respirent. Onentendait le timbre clair et plein de sa voix par-dessus les cent voixde ses compagnes, non qu'elle criat comme font les chanteurs sans ame etsans souffle, mais parce que son timbre etait d'une purete irreprochableet son accent d'une nettete parfaite. En outre elle sentait et ellecomprenait jusqu'a la moindre intention de la musique qu'elle exprimait.Elle seule, en un mot, etait une musicienne et un maitre, au milieu dece troupeau d'intelligences vulgaires, de voix fraiches et de volontesmolles. Elle remplissait donc instinctivement et sans ostentation sonrole de puissance; et tant que les chants durerent, elle imposanaturellement sa domination qu'on sentait necessaire. Apres qu'ilseurent cesse, les choristes lui en firent interieurement un grief et uncrime; et telle qui, en se sentant faiblir, l'avait interrogee et commeimploree du regard, s'attribua tous les eloges qui furent donnes enmasse a l'ecole du Porpora. A ces eloges, le maitre souriait sans riendire; mais il regardait Consuelo, et Anzoleto comprenait fort bien.Apres le salut et la benediction, les choristes prirent part a unecollation friande que leur fit servir le comte dans un des parloirs ducouvent. La grille separait deux grandes tables en forme de demi-lune,mises en regard l'une de l'autre; une ouverture, mesuree sur ladimension d'un immense pate, etait menagee au centre du grillage pourfaire passer les plats, que le comte presentait lui-meme avec grace auxprincipales religieuses et aux eleves. Celles-ci, vetues en beguines,venaient par douzaines s'asseoir alternativement aux places vacantesdans l'interieur du cloitre. La superieure, assise tout pres de lagrille, se trouvait ainsi a la droite du comte place dans la salleexterieure. Mais a la gauche de Zustiniani, une place restait vacante;Marcello, Porpora, le cure de la paroisse, les principaux pretres quiavaient officie a la ceremonie, quelques patriciens dilettanti etadministrateurs laiques de la Scuola; enfin le bel Anzoleto, avec sonhabit noir et l'epee au cote, remplissaient la table des seculiers. Lesjeunes chanteuses etaient fort animees ordinairement en pareilleoccasion; le plaisir de la gourmandise, celui de converser avec deshommes, l'envie de plaire ou d'etre tout au moins remarquees, leurdonnaient beaucoup de babil et de vivacite. Mais ce jour-la le gouterfut triste et contraint. C'est que le projet du comte avait transpire(quel secret peut tourner autour d'un couvent sans s'y infiltrer parquelque fente?) et que chacune de ces jeunes filles s'etait flattee ensecret d'etre presentee par le Porpora pour succeder a la Corilla. Leprofesseur avait eu meme la malice d'encourager les illusions dequelques-unes, soit pour les disposer a mieux chanter sa musique devantMarcello, soit pour se venger, par leur depit futur, de tout celuiqu'elles lui causaient aux lecons. Ce qu'il y a de certain, c'est que laClorinda, qui n'etait qu'externe a ce conservatoire, avait fait grandetoilette pour ce jour-la, et s'attendait a prendre place a la droite ducomte; mais quand elle vit cette _guenille_ de Consuelo, avec sa petiterobe noire et son air tranquille, cette _laideron_ qu'elle affectait demepriser, reputee desormais la seule musicienne et la seule beaute del'ecole, s'asseoir entre le comte et Marcello, elle devint laide decolere, laide comme Consuelo ne l'avait jamais ete, comme le deviendraitVenus en personne, agitee par un sentiment bas et mechant. Anzoletol'examinait attentivement, et, triomphant de sa victoire, il s'assitaupres d'elle, et l'accabla de fadeurs railleuses qu'elle n'eut pasl'esprit de comprendre et qui la consolerent bientot. Elle s'imaginaqu'elle se vengeait de sa rivale en fixant l'attention de son fiance, etelle n'epargna rien pour l'enivrer de ses charmes. Mais elle etait tropbornee et l'amant de Consuelo avait trop de finesse pour que cette lutteinegale ne la couvrit pas de ridicule.Cependant le comte Zustiniani, en causant avec Consuelo, s'emerveillaitde lui trouver autant de tact, de bon sens et de charme dans laconversation, qu'il lui avait trouve de talent et de puissance al'eglise. Quoiqu'elle fut absolument depourvue de coquetterie, elleavait dans ses manieres une franchise enjouee et une bonhomie confiantequi inspirait je ne sais quelle sympathie soudaine, irresistible. Quandle gouter fut fini, il l'engagea a venir prendre le frais du soir, danssa gondole avec ses amis. Marcello en fut dispense, a cause du mauvaisetat de sa sante. Mais le Porpora, le comte Barberigo, et plusieursautres patriciens accepterent. Anzoleto fut admis. Consuelo, qui sesentait un peu troublee d'etre seule avec tant d'hommes, pria tout basle comte de vouloir bien inviter la Clorinda, et Zustiniani, qui necomprenait pas le badinage d'Anzoleto avec cette pauvre fille, ne futpas fache de le voir occupe d'une autre que de sa fiancee. Ce noblecomte, grace a la legerete de son caractere, grace a sa belle figure, ason opulence, a son theatre, et aussi aux moeurs faciles du pays et del'epoque, ne manquait pas d'une bonne dose de fatuite. Anime, par le vinde Grece et l'enthousiasme musical, impatient de se venger de _saperfide_ Corilla, il n'imagina rien de plus naturel que de faire la coura Consuelo; et, s'asseyant pres d'elle dans la gondole, tandis qu'ilavait arrange chacun de maniere a ce que l'autre couple de jeunes gens setrouvat a l'extremite opposee, il commenca a couver du regard sa nouvelleproie d'une facon fort significative. La bonne Consuelo n'y compritpourtant rien du tout. Sa candeur et sa loyaute se seraient refusees asupposer que le protecteur de son ami put avoir de si mechants desseins;mais sa modestie habituelle, que n'alterait en rien le triomphe eclatantde la journee, ne lui permit pas meme de croire de tels desseinspossibles. Elle s'obstina a respecter dans son coeur le seigneur illustrequi l'adoptait avec Anzoleto, et a s'amuser ingenument d'une partie deplaisir ou elle n'entendait pas malice.Tant de calme et de bonne foi surprirent le comte, au point qu'il restaincertain si c'etait l'abandon joyeux d'une ame sans resistance ou lastupidite d'une innocence parfaite. A dix-huit ans, cependant, une filleen sait bien long, en Italie, je veux dire _en savait_, il y a cent anssurtout, avec un _ami_ comme Anzoleto. Toute vraisemblance etait donc enfaveur des esperances du comte. Et cependant, chaque fois qu'il prenaitla main de sa protegee, ou qu'il avancait un bras pour entourer sataille, une crainte indefinissable l'arretait aussitot, et il eprouvaitun sentiment d'incertitude et presque de respect dont il ne pouvait serendre compte.Barberigo trouvait aussi la Consuelo fort seduisante dans sa simplicite;et il eut volontiers eleve des pretentions du meme genre que celle ducomte, s'il n'eut cru fort delicat de sa part de ne pas contrarier lesprojets de son ami. "A tout seigneur tout honneur, se disait-il envoyant nager les yeux de Zustiniani dans une atmosphere d'enivrementvoluptueux. Mon tour viendra plus tard." En attendant, comme le jeuneBarberigo n'etait pas trop habitue a contempler les etoiles dans unepromenade avec des femmes, il se demanda de quel droit ce petit droled'Anzoleto accaparait la blonde Clorinda, et, se rapprochant d'elle, ilessaya de faire comprendre au jeune tenor que son role serait plutot deprendre la rame que de courtiser la donzelle. Anzoleto n'etait pas assezbien eleve, malgre sa penetration merveilleuse, pour comprendre aupremier mot. D'ailleurs il etait d'un orgueil voisin de l'insolence avecles patriciens. Il les detestait cordialement, et sa souplesse avec euxn'etait qu'une fourberie pleine de mepris interieur. Barberigo, voyantqu'il se faisait un plaisir de le contrarier, s'avisa d'une vengeancecruelle."Parbleu, dit-il bien haut a la Clorinda, voyez donc le succes de votreamie Consuelo! Ou s'arretera-t-elle aujourd'hui? Non contente de fairefureur dans toute la ville par la beaute de son chant, la voila qui faittourner la tete a notre pauvre comte, par le feu de ses oeillades. Il endeviendra fou, s'il ne l'est deja, et voila les affaires de madameCorilla tout a fait gatees.--Oh! il n'y a rien a craindre! repliqua la Clorinda d'un air sournois.Consuelo est eprise d'Anzoleto, que voici; elle est sa fiancee, ilsbrulent l'un pour l'autre depuis je ne sais combien d'annees.--Je ne sais combien d'annees d'amour peuvent etre oubliees en un clind'oeil, reprit Barberigo, surtout quand les yeux de Zustiniani se melentde decocher le trait mortel. Ne le pensez-vous pas aussi, belleClorinda?"Anzoleto ne supporta pas longtemps ce persiflage. Mille serpents seglissaient deja dans son coeur. Jusque la il n'avait eu ni soupcon nisouci de rien de pareil: il s'etait livre en aveugle a la joie de voirtriompher son amie; et c'etait autant pour donner a son transport unecontenance, que pour gouter un raffinement de vanite, qu'il s'amusaitdepuis deux heures a railler la victime de cette journee enivrante.Apres quelques quolibets echanges avec Barberigo, il feignit de prendreinteret a la discussion musicale que le Porpora soutenait sur le milieude la barque avec les autres promeneurs; et, s'eloignant peu a peu d'uneplace qu'il n'avait plus envie de disputer, il se glissa dans l'ombrejusqu'a la proue. Des le premier essai qu'il fit pour rompre letete-a-tete du comte avec sa fiancee, il vit bien que Zustiniani goutaitpeu cette diversion; car il lui repondit avec froideur et meme avecsecheresse. Enfin, apres plusieurs questions oiseuses mal accueillies,il lui fut conseille d'aller ecouter les choses profondes et savantesque le grand Porpora disait sur le contre-point."Le grand Porpora n'est pas mon maitre, repondit Anzoleto d'un ton badinqui dissimulait sa rage interieure aussi bien que possible; il est celuide Consuelo; et s'il plaisait a votre chere et bien-aimee seigneurie,ajouta-t-il tout bas en se courbant aupres du comte d'un air insinuantet caressant, que ma pauvre Consuelo ne prit pas d'autres lecons quecelles de son vieux professeur ...--Cher et bien-aime Zoto, repondit le comte d'un ton caressant, pleind'une malice profonde, j'ai un mot a vous dire a l'oreille;" et, sepenchant vers lui, il ajouta: "Votre fiancee a du recevoir de vous deslecons de vertu qui la rendront invulnerable! Mais si j'avais quelquepretention a lui en donner d'autres, j'aurais le droit de l'essayer aumoins pendant une soiree."Anzoleto se sentit froid de la tete aux pieds."Votre gracieuse seigneurie daignera-t-elle s'expliquer? dit-il d'unevoix etouffee.--Ce sera bientot fait, mon gracieux ami, repondit le comte d'une voixclaire: _gondole pour gondole_."Anzoleto fut terrifie en voyant que le comte avait decouvert sontete-a-tete avec la Corilla. Cette folle et audacieuse fille s'en etaitvantee a Zustiniani dans une terrible querelle fort violente qu'ilsavaient eue ensemble. Le coupable essaya vainement de faire l'etonne."Allez donc ecouter ce que dit le Porpora sur les principes de l'ecolenapolitaine, reprit le comte. Vous viendrez me le repeter, celam'interesse beaucoup.--Je m'en apercois, excellence, repondit Anzoleto furieux et pret a seperdre.--Eh bien! tu n'y vas pas? dit l'innocente Consuelo, etonnee de sonhesitation. J'y vais, moi, seigneur comte. Vous verrez que je suis votreservante." Et avant que le comte put la retenir, elle avait franchi d'unbond leger la banquette qui la separait de son vieux maitre, et s'etaitassise sur ses talons a cote de lui.Le comte, voyant que ses affaires n'etaient pas fort avancees aupresd'elle, jugea necessaire de dissimuler."Anzoleto, dit-il en souriant et en tirant l'oreille de son protege unpeu fort, ici se bornera ma vengeance. Elle n'a pas ete aussi loin abeaucoup pres que votre delit. Mais aussi je ne fais pas de comparaisonentre le plaisir d'entretenir honnetement votre maitresse un quartd'heure en presence de dix personnes, et celui que vous avez goute tetea tete avec la mienne dans une gondole bien fermee.--Seigneur comte, s'ecria Anzoleto, violemment agite, je proteste surmon honneur....--Ou est-il, votre honneur? reprit le comte, est-il dans votre oreillegauche?" Et en meme temps il menacait cette malheureuse oreille d'unelecon pareille a celle que l'autre venait de recevoir."Accordez-vous donc assez peu de finesse a votre protege, dit Anzoleto,reprenant sa presence d'esprit, pour ne pas savoir qu'il n'aurait jamaiscommis une pareille balourdise?--Commise ou non, repondit sechement le comte, c'est la chose du mondela plus indifferente pour moi en ce moment." Et il alla s'asseoir aupresde Consuelo.XII.La dissertation musicale se prolongea jusque dans le salon du palaisZustiniani, ou l'on rentra vers minuit pour prendre le chocolat et lessorbets. Du technique de l'art on etait passe au style, aux idees, auxformes anciennes et modernes, enfin a l'expression, et de la auxartistes, et a leurs differentes manieres de sentir et d'exprimer. LePorpora parlait avec admiration de son maitre Scarlatti, le premier quieut imprime un caractere pathetique aux compositions religieuses. Maisil s'arretait la, et ne voulait pas que la musique sacree empietat surle domaine du profane en se permettant les ornements, les traits et lesroulades."Est-ce donc, lui dit Anzoleto, que votre seigneurie reprouve ces traitset ces ornements difficiles qui ont cependant fait le succes et lacelebrite de son illustre eleve Farinelli?--Je ne les reprouve qu'a l'eglise, repondit le maestro. Je les approuveau theatre; mais je les veux a leur place, et surtout j'en proscrisl'abus. Je les veux d'un gout pur, sobres, ingenieux, elegants, et, dansleurs modulations, appropries non-seulement au sujet qu'on traite, maisencore au personnage qu'on represente, a la passion qu'on exprime, et ala situation ou se trouve le personnage. Les nymphes et les bergerespeuvent roucouler comme les oiseaux, ou cadencer leurs accents comme lemurmure des fontaines; mais Medee ou Didon ne peuvent que sangloter ourugir comme la lionne blessee. La coquette peut charger d'ornementscapricieux et recherches ses folles cavatines. La Corilla excelle en cegenre: mais qu'elle veuille exprimer les emotions profondes, les grandespassions, elle reste au-dessous de son role; et c'est en vain qu'elles'agite, c'est en vain qu'elle gonfle sa voix et son sein: un traitdeplace, une roulade absurde, viennent changer en un instant en ridiculeparodie ce sublime qu'elle croyait atteindre. Vous avez tous entendu laFaustina Pordoni, aujourd'hui madame Hasse. En de certains rolesappropries a ses qualites brillantes, elle n'avait, point de rivale.Mais que la Cuzzoni vint, avec son sentiment pur et profond, faireparler la douleur, la priere, ou la tendresse, les larmes qu'elle vousarrachait effacaient en un instant de vos coeurs le souvenir de toutesles merveilles que la Faustina avait prodiguees a vos sens. C'est qu'ily a le talent de la matiere, et le genie de l'ame. Il y a ce qui amuse,et ce qui emeut; ce qui etonne et ce qui ravit. Je sais fort bien queles tours de force sont en faveur; mais quant a moi, si je les aienseignes a mes eleves comme des accessoires utiles, je suis presque am'en repentir, lorsque je vois la plupart d'entre eux en abuser, etsacrifier le necessaire au superflu, l'attendrissement durable del'auditoire aux cris de surprise et aux trepignements d'un plaisirfievreux et passager."Personne ne combattait cette conclusion eternellement vraie dans tousles arts, et qui sera toujours appliquee a leurs diverses manifestationspar les ames elevees. Cependant le comte, qui etait curieux de savoircomment Consuelo chanterait la musique profane, feignit de contredire unpeu l'austerite des principes du Porpora; mais voyant que la modestefille, au lieu de refuter ses heresies, tournait toujours ses yeux versson vieux maitre, comme pour lui demander de repondre victorieusement,il prit le parti de s'attaquer directement a elle-meme, et de luidemander si elle entendait chanter sur la scene avec autant de sagesseet de purete qu'a l'eglise."Je ne crois pas, repondit-elle avec une humilite sincere, que j'ytrouve les meme inspirations, et je crains d'y valoir beaucoup moins.--Cette reponse modeste et spirituelle me rassure, dit le comte, je suiscertain que vous vous inspirerez assez de la presence d'un publicardent, curieux, un peu gate, je l'avoue, pour condescendre a etudierces difficultes brillantes dont chaque jour il se montre plus avide.--Etudier! dit le Porpora avec un sourire plein de finesse.--Etudier! s'ecria Anzoleto avec un dedain superbe.--Oui sans doute, etudier, reprit Consuelo avec sa douceur accoutumee.Quoique je me sois exercee quelquefois a ce genre de travail, je nepense pas encore etre capable de rivaliser avec les illustres chanteusesqui ont paru sur notre scene....--Tu mens! s'ecria Anzoleto tout anime. Monseigneur, elle ment!faites-lui chanter les airs les plus ornes et les plus difficiles durepertoire, vous verrez ce qu'elle sait faire.--Si je ne craignais pas qu'elle fut fatiguee ..." dit le comte, dont lesyeux petillaient deja d'impatience et de desir.Consuelo tourna les siens naivement vers le Porpora, comme pour prendreses ordres."Au fait, dit celui-ci, comme elle ne se fatigue pas pour si peu, etcomme nous sommes ici en petite et excellente compagnie, on pourraitexaminer son talent sur toutes les faces. Voyons, seigneur comte,choisissez un air, et accompagnez-la vous-meme au clavecin.--L'emotion que sa voix et sa presence me causent, repondit Zustiniani,me feraient faire de fausses notes. Pourquoi pas vous, mon maitre?--Je voudrais la regarder chanter, dit le Porpora; car entre nous soitdit, je l'ai toujours entendue sans jamais songer a la voir. Il faut queje sache comment elle se tient, ce qu'elle fait de sa bouche et de sesyeux. Allons, leve-toi, ma fille; c'est pour moi aussi que l'epreuve vaetre tentee.--Ce sera donc moi qui l'accompagnerai, dit Anzoleto en s'asseyant auclavecin.--Vous allez m'intimider trop, mon maitre, dit Consuelo a Porpora.--La timidite n'appartient qu'a la sottise, repondit le maitre.Quiconque se sent penetre d'un amour vrai pour son art ne peut riencraindre. Si tu trembles, tu n'as que de la vanite; si tu perds tesmoyens, tu n'en as que de factices; et s'il en est ainsi, je suis lapour dire tout le premier: La Consuelo n'est bonne a rien!"Et sans s'inquieter de l'effet desastreux que pouvaient produire desencouragements aussi tendres, le professeur mit ses lunettes, arrangeasa chaise bien en face de son eleve, et commenca a battre la mesure surla queue du clavecin pour donner le vrai mouvement a la ritournelle. Onavait choisi un air brillant, bizarre et difficile, tire d'un operabouffe de Galuppi, _la Diavolessa_, afin de prendre tout a coup le genrele plus different de celui ou Consuelo avait triomphe le matin. La jeunefille avait une si prodigieuse facilite qu'elle etait arrivee, presquesans etudes, a faire faire, en se jouant, tous les tours de force alorsconnus, a sa voix souple et puissante. Le Porpora lui avait recommandede faire ces exercices, et, de temps en temps, les lui avait faitrepeter pour s'assurer qu'elle ne les negligeait pas. Mais il n'y avaitjamais donne assez de temps et d'attention pour savoir ce dontl'etonnante eleve etait capable en ce genre. Pour se venger de larudesse qu'il venait de lui montrer, Consuelo eut l'espieglerie desurcharger l'air extravagant de _la Diavolessa_ d'une multituded'ornements et de traits regardes jusque la comme impossibles, etqu'elle improvisa aussi tranquillement que si elle les eut notes etetudies avec soin. Ces ornements furent si savants de modulations, d'uncaractere si energique, si infernal, et meles, au milieu de leur plusimpetueuse gaite, d'accents si lugubres, qu'un frisson de terreur vinttraverser l'enthousiasme de l'auditoire, et que le Porpora, se levanttout a coup, s'ecria avec force:"C'est toi qui es le diable en personne!"Consuelo finit son air par un crescendo de force qui enleva les crisd'admiration, tandis qu'elle se rasseyait sur sa chaise en eclatant derire."Mechante fille! dit le Porpora, tu m'as joue un tour pendable. Tu t'esmoquee de moi. Tu m'as cache la moitie de tes etudes et de tesressources. Je n'avais plus rien a t'enseigner depuis longtemps, et tuprenais mes lecons par hypocrisie, peut-etre pour me ravir tous lessecrets de la composition et de l'enseignement, afin de me surpasser entoutes choses, et de me faire passer ensuite pour un vieux pedant!--Mon maitre, repondit Consuelo, je n'ai pas fait autre chose qu'imitervotre malice envers l'empereur Charles. Ne m'avez-vous pas raconte cetteaventure? comme quoi Sa Majeste Imperiale n'aimait pas les trilles, etvous avait fait defense d'en introduire un seul dans votre oratorio, etcomme quoi, ayant scrupuleusement respecte sa defense jusqu'a la fin del'oeuvre, vous lui aviez donne un divertissement de bon gout a la fuguefinale en la commencant par quatre trilles ascendantes, repetees ensuitea l'infini, dans le _stretto_ par toutes les parties? Vous avez fait cesoir le proces a l'abus des ornements, et puis vous m'avez ordonne d'enfaire. J'en ai fait trop, afin de vous prouver que moi aussi je puisoutrer un travers dont je veux bien me laisser accuser.--Je te dis que tu es le diable, reprit le Porpora. Maintenantchante-nous quelque chose d'humain, et chante-le comme tu l'entendras;car je vois bien que je ne puis plus etre ton maitre.--Vous serez toujours mon maitre respecte et bien-aime, s'ecria-t-elleen se jetant a son cou et en le serrant a l'etouffer; c'est a vous queje dois mon pain et mon instruction depuis dix ans. O mon maitre! on ditque vous avez fait des ingrats: que Dieu me retire a l'instant memel'amour et la voix, si je porte dans mon coeur le poison de l'orgueil etde l'ingratitude!"Le Porpora devint pale, balbutia quelques mots, et deposa un baiserpaternel sur le front de son eleve: mais il y laissa une larme; etConsuelo, qui n'osa l'essuyer, sentit secher lentement sur son frontcette larme froide et douloureuse de la vieillesse abandonnee et dugenie malheureux. Elle en ressentit une emotion profonde et comme uneterreur religieuse qui eclipsa toute sa gaite et eteignit toute sa vervepour le reste de la soiree. Une heure apres, quand on eut epuise autourd'elle et pour elle toutes les formules de l'admiration, de la surpriseet du ravissement, sans pouvoir la distraire de sa melancolie, on luidemanda un specimen de son talent dramatique. Elle chanta un grand airde Jomelli dans l'opera de _Didon abandonnee_; jamais elle n'avait mieuxsenti le besoin d'exhaler sa tristesse; elle fut sublime de pathetique,de simplicite, de grandeur, et belle de visage plus encore qu'elle nel'avait ete a l'eglise. Son teint s'etait anime d'un peu de fievre, sesyeux lancaient de sombres eclairs; ce n'etait plus une sainte, c'etaitmieux encore, c'etait une femme devoree d'amour. Le comte, son amiBarberigo, Anzoleto, tous les auditeurs, et, je crois, le vieux Porporalui-meme, faillirent en perdre l'esprit. La Clorinda suffoqua dedesespoir. Consuelo, a qui le comte declara que, des le lendemain, sonengagement serait dresse et signe, le pria de lui promettre une gracesecondaire, et de lui engager sa parole a la maniere des ancienschevaliers, sans savoir de quoi il s'agissait. Il le fit, et l'on sesepara, brise de cette emotion delicieuse que procurent les grandeschoses, et qu'imposent les grandes intelligences.XIII.Pendant que Consuelo avait remporte tous ces triomphes, Anzoleto avaitvecu si completement en elle, qu'il s'etait oublie lui-meme. Cependantlorsque le comte, en les congediant, signifia l'engagement de sa fianceesans lui dire un mot du sien, il remarqua la froideur avec laquelle ilavait ete traite par lui, durant ces dernieres heures; et la crainted'etre perdu sans retour dans son esprit empoisonna toute sa joie. Illui vint dans la pensee de laisser Consuelo sur l'escalier, au bras duPorpora, et de courir se jeter aux pieds de son protecteur; mais commeen cet instant il le haissait, il faut dire a sa louange qu'il resista ala tentation de s'aller humilier devant lui. Comme il prenait conge duPorpora, et se disposait a courir le long du canal avec Consuelo, legondolier du comte l'arreta, et lui dit que, par les ordres de sonmaitre, la gondole attendait la signora Consuelo pour la reconduire. Unesueur froide lui vint au front."La signora est habituee a cheminer sur ses jambes, repondit-il avecviolence. Elle est fort obligee au comte de ses gracieusetes.--De quel droit refusez-vous pour elle?" dit le comte qui etait sur sestalons."Anzoleto se retourna, et le vit, non la tete nue comme un homme quireconduit son monde, mais le manteau sur l'epaule, son epee dans unemain et son chapeau dans l'autre, comme un homme qui va courir lesaventures nocturnes. Anzoleto ressentit un tel acces de fureur qu'il eutla pensee de lui enfoncer entre les cotes ce couteau mince et affilequ'un Venitien homme du peuple cache toujours dans quelque pocheinvisible de son ajustement."J'espere, Madame, dit le comte a Consuelo d'un ton ferme, que vous neme ferez pas l'affront de refuser ma gondole pour vous reconduire, et lechagrin de ne pas vous appuyer sur mon bras pour y entrer."Consuelo, toujours confiante, et ne devinant rien de ce qui se passaitautour d'elle, accepta, remercia, et abandonnant son joli coude arrondia la main du comte, elle sauta dans la gondole sans ceremonie. Alors undialogue muet, mais energique, s'etablit entre le comte et Anzoleto. Lecomte avait un pied sur la rive, un pied sur la barque, et de l'oeiltoisait Anzoleto, qui, debout sur la derniere marche du perron, letoisait aussi, mais d'un air farouche, la main cachee dans sa poitrine,et serrant le manche de son couteau. Un mouvement de plus vers labarque, et le comte etait perdu. Ce qu'il y eut de plus venitien danscette scene rapide et silencieuse, c'est que les deux rivauxs'observerent sans hater de part ni d'autre une catastrophe imminente.Le comte n'avait d'autre intention que celle de torturer son rival parune irresolution apparente, et il le fit a loisir, quoiqu'il vit fortbien et comprit encore mieux le geste d'Anzoleto, pret a le poignarder.De son cote, Anzoleto eut la force d'attendre sans se trahirofficiellement qu'il plut au comte d'achever sa plaisanterie feroce, oude renoncer a la vie. Ceci dura deux minutes qui lui semblerent unsiecle, et que le comte supporta avec un mepris stoique; apres quoi ilfit une profonde reverence a Consuelo, et se tournant vers son protege:"Je vous permets, lui dit-il, de monter aussi dans ma gondole; al'avenir vous saurez comment se conduit un galant homme."Et il se recula pour faire passer Anzoleto dans sa barque. Puis il donnaaux gondoliers l'ordre de ramer vers la Corte-Minelli, et il restadebout sur la rive, immobile comme une statue. Il semblait attendre depied ferme une nouvelle velleite de meurtre de la part de son rivalhumilie."Comment donc le comte sait-il ou tu demeures? fut le premier motqu'Anzoleto adressa a son amie des qu'ils eurent perdu de vue le palaisZustiniani.--Parce que je le lui ai dit, repartit Consuelo.--Et pourquoi le lui as-tu dit?--Parce qu'il me l'a demande.--Tu ne devines donc pas du tout pourquoi il voulait le savoir?--Apparemment pour me faire reconduire.--Tu crois que c'est la tout? Tu crois qu'il ne viendra pas te voir?--Venir me voir? Quelle folie! Dans une aussi miserable demeure? Ceserait un exces de politesse de sa part que je ne desire pas du tout.--Tu fais bien de ne pas le desirer, Consuelo; car un exces de honteserait peut-etre pour toi le resultat de cet exces d'honneur!--De la honte? Et pourquoi de la honte a moi? Vraiment je ne comprendsrien a tes discours ce soir, cher Anzoleto, et je te trouve singulier deme parler de choses que je n'entends point, au lieu de me dire la joieque tu eprouves du succes inespere et incroyable de notre journee.--Inespere, en effet, repondit Anzoleto avec amertume.--Il me semblait qu'a vepres, et ce soir pendant qu'on m'applaudissait,tu etais plus enivre que moi! Tu me regardais avec des yeux sipassionnes, et je goutais si bien mon bonheur en le voyant reflete surton visage! Mais depuis quelques instants te voila sombre et bizarrecomme tu l'es quelquefois quand nous manquons de pain ou quand notreavenir parait incertain et facheux.--Et maintenant, tu veux que je me rejouisse de l'avenir? Il estpossible qu'il ne soit pas incertain, en effet; mais a coup sur il n'arien de divertissant pour moi!--Que te faut-il donc de plus? Il y a a peine huit jours que tu asdebute chez le comte, tu as eu un succes d'enthousiasme....--Mon succes aupres du comte est fort eclipse par le tien; ma chere. Tule sais de reste.--J'espere bien que non. D'ailleurs, quand cela serait, nous ne pouvonspas etre jaloux l'un de l'autre."Cette parole ingenue, dite avec un accent de tendresse et de veriteirresistible, fit rentrer le calme dans l'ame d'Anzoleto."Oh! tu as raison, dit-il en serrant sa fiancee dans ses bras, nous nepouvons pas etre jaloux l'un de l'autre; car nous ne pouvons pas noustromper."Mais en meme temps qu'il prononca ces derniers mots, il se rappela avecremords son commencement d'aventure avec la Corilla, et il lui vintsubitement dans l'idee, que le comte, pour achever de l'en punir, nemanquerait pas de le devoiler a Consuelo, le jour ou il croirait sesesperances tant soit peu encouragees par elle. Il retomba dans une mornereverie, et Consuelo devint pensive aussi."Pourquoi, lui dit-elle apres un instant de silence, dis-tu que nous nepouvons pas nous tromper? A coup sur, c'est une grande verite; mais aquel propos cela t'est-il venu?--Tiens, ne parlons plus dans cette gondole, repondit Anzoleto a voixbasse; je crains qu'on n'ecoute nos paroles, et qu'on ne les rapporte aucomte. Cette couverture de soie et de velours est bien mince, et cesbarcarolles de palais ont les oreilles quatre fois plus larges et plusprofondes que nos barcarolles de place.--Laisse-moi monter avec toidans ta chambre, lui dit-il lorsqu'on les eut deposes sur la rive, al'entree de la Corte-Minelli.--Tu sais que c'est contraire a nos habitudes et a nos conventions, luirepondit-elle.--Oh! ne me refuse pas cela, s'ecria Anzoleto, tu me mettrais ledesespoir et la fureur dans l'ame."Effrayee de son accent et de ses paroles, Consuelo n'osa refuser; etquand elle eut allume sa lampe et tire ses rideaux, le voyant sombre etcomme perdu dans ses pensees, elle entoura de ses bras le cou de sonfiance:"Comme tu me parais malheureux et inquiet ce soir! lui dit-elletristement. Que se passe-t-il donc en toi?--Tu ne le sais pas, Consuelo? tu ne t'en doutes pas?--Non! sur mon ame!--Jure-le; que tu ne devines pas! Jure-le sur l'ame de ta mere, et surton Christ que tu pries tous les matins et tous les soirs.--Oh! je te le jure, sur mon Christ et sur l'ame de ma mere.--Et sur notre amour?--Sur notre amour et sur notre salut eternel!--Je te crois, Consuelo; car ce serait la premiere fois de ta vie que tuferais un mensonge.--Et maintenant m'expliqueras-tu ...?--Je ne t'expliquerai rien. Peut-etre faudra-t-il bientot que je mefasse comprendre.... Ah! quand ce moment sera venu, tu ne m'auras dejaque trop compris. Malheur! malheur a nous deux le jour ou tu sauras ceque je souffre maintenant!--O mon Dieu, de quel affreux malheur sommes-nous donc menaces? Helas!c'est donc sous le coup de je ne sais quelle malediction que nousdevions rentrer dans cette pauvre chambre, ou nous n'avions eu jusqu'apresent aucun secret l'un pour l'autre! Quelque chose me disait bien,quand je suis sortie ce matin, que j'y rentrerais la mort dans l'ame.Qu'ai-je donc fait pour ne pas jouir d'un jour qui semblait si beau?N'ai-je pas prie Dieu ardemment et sincerement? N'ai-je pas eloigne demoi toute pensee d'orgueil? N'ai-je pas chante le mieux qu'il m'a etepossible? N'ai-je pas souffert de l'humiliation de la Clorinda? N'ai-jepas obtenu du comte, sans qu'il s'en doutat et sans qu'il puisse sededire, la promesse qu'elle serait engagee comme _seconda donna_ avecnous? Qu'ai-je donc fait de mal, encore une fois, pour souffrir lesdouleurs que tu m'annonces, et que je ressens deja, puisque, toi, tu leseprouves?--En verite, Consuelo, tu as eu la pensee de faire engager la Clorinda?--J'y suis resolue, si le comte est un homme de parole. Cette pauvrefille a toujours reve le theatre, elle n'a pas d'autre existence devantelle.--Et tu crois que le comte renverra la Rosalba, qui sait quelque chose,pour la Clorinda, qui ne sait rien?--La Rosalba suivra la fortune de sa soeur Corilla, et quant a laClorinda, nous lui donnerons des lecons, nous lui apprendrons a tirer lemeilleur parti de sa voix, qui est jolie. Le public sera indulgent pourune aussi belle fille. D'ailleurs, quand meme je n'obtiendrais sonadmission que comme troisieme femme, ce serait toujours une admission,un debut dans la carriere, un commencement d'existence.--Tu es une sainte, Consuelo. Tu ne vois pas que cette pecore, enacceptant tes bienfaits, et quoiqu'elle dut s'estimer trop heureused'etre troisieme ou quatrieme femme, ne te pardonnera jamais d'etre lapremiere?--Qu'importe son ingratitude? Va, j'en sais long deja sur l'ingratitudeet les ingrats!--Toi? dit Anzoleto en eclatant de rire et en l'embrassant avec sonancienne effusion de frere.--Oui, repondit-elle, enchantee de l'avoir distrait de ses soucis; j'aieu jusqu'a present toujours devant les yeux, et j'aurai toujours gravedans l'ame, l'image de mon noble maitre Porpora. Il lui est echappe biensouvent devant moi des paroles ameres et profondes qu'il me croyaitincapable de comprendre; mais elles creusaient bien avant dans moncoeur, et elles n'en sortiront jamais. C'est un homme qui a biensouffert, et que le chagrin devore. Par lui, par sa tristesse, par sesindignations concentrees, par les discours qui lui ont echappe devantmoi, il m'a appris que les artistes sont plus dangereux et plus mechantsque tu ne penses, mon cher ange; que le public est leger, oublieux;cruel, injuste; qu'une grande carriere est une croix lourde a porter, etla gloire une couronne d'epines! Oui, je sais tout cela; et j'y ai pensesi souvent, et j'ai tant reflechi la-dessus, que je me sens assez fortepour ne pas m'etonner beaucoup et pour ne pas trop me laisser abattrequand j'en ferai l'experience par moi-meme. Voila pourquoi tu ne m'aspas vue trop enivree aujourd'hui de mon triomphe; voila pourquoi aussije ne suis pas decouragee en ce moment de tes noires pensees. Je ne lescomprends pas encore; mais je sais qu'avec toi, et pourvu que tum'aimes, je pourrai lutter avec assez de force pour ne pas tomber dansla haine du genre humain, comme mon pauvre maitre, qui est un noblevieillard et un enfant malheureux."En ecoutant parler son amie, Anzoleto reprit aussi son courage et saserenite. Elle exercait sur lui une grande puissance, et chaque jour ildecouvrait en elle une fermete de caractere et une droiture d'intentionsqui suppleait a tout ce qui lui manquait a lui-meme. Les terreurs que lajalousie lui avait inspirees s'effacerent donc de son souvenir au boutd'un quart d'heure d'entretien avec elle; et quand elle le questionna denouveau, il eut tellement honte d'avoir soupconne un etre si pur et sicalme, qu'il donna d'autres motifs a son agitation. "Je n'ai qu'unecrainte, lui dit-il, c'est que le comte ne te trouve tellementsuperieure a moi, qu'il ne me juge indigne de paraitre a cote de toidevant le public. Il ne m'a pas fait chanter ce soir, quoique jem'attendisse a ce qu'il nous demanderait un duo. Il semblait avoiroublie jusqu'a mon existence. Il ne s'est meme pas apercu qu'ent'accompagnant, je touchais assez joliment le clavecin. Enfin, lorsqu'ilt'a signifie ton engagement, il ne m'a pas dit un mot du mien. Commentn'as-tu pas remarque une chose aussi etrange?--La pensee ne m'est pas venue qu'il lui fut possible de vouloirm'engager sans toi. Est-ce qu'il ne sait pas que rien ne pourrait m'ydecider, que nous sommes fiances, que nous nous aimons? Est-ce que tu nele lui as pas dit bien positivement?--Je lui ai dit; mais peut-etre croit-il que je me vante, Consuelo.--En ce cas je me vanterai moi-meme de mon amour, Anzoleto; je lui diraitout cela si bien qu'il n'en doutera pas. Mais tu t'abuses, mon ami; lecomte n'a pas juge necessaire de te parler de ton engagement, parce quec'est une chose arretee, conclue, depuis le jour ou tu as chante chezlui avec tant de succes.--Mais non signe! Et le tien sera signe demain: il te l'a dit!--Crois-tu que je signerai la premiere? Oh! non pas! Tu as bien fait deme mettre sur mes gardes. Mon nom ne sera ecrit qu'au bas du tien.--Tu me le jures?--Oh! fi! Vas-tu encore me faire faire des serments pour une chose quetu sais si bien? Vraiment, tu ne m'aimes pas ce soir, ou tu veux mefaire souffrir; car tu fais semblant de croire que je ne t'aime point."A cette pensee, les yeux de Consuelo se gonflerent, et elle s'assit avecun petit air boudeur qui la rendit charmante."Au fait, je suis un fou, un sot, pensa Anzoleto. Comment ai-je pupenser un instant que le comte triompherait d'une ame si pure et d'unamour si complet? Est-ce qu'il n'est pas assez experimente pour voir dupremier coup d'oeil que Consuelo n'est pas son fait; et aurait-il eteassez genereux ce soir pour me faire monter dans la gondole a sa place,s'il n'eut connu pertinemment qu'il y jouerait aupres d'elle le roled'un fat ridicule? Non, non; mon sort est assure, ma positioninexpugnable. Que Consuelo lui plaise, qu'il l'aime, qu'il la courtise,tout cela ne servira qu'a avancer ma fortune; car elle saura bienobtenir de lui tout ce qu'elle voudra sans s'exposer. Consuelo en sauravite plus que moi sur ce chapitre. Elle est forte, elle est prudente.Les pretentions du cher comte tourneront a mon profit et a ma gloire."Et, abjurant completement tous ses doutes, il se jeta aux pieds de sonamie, et se livra a l'enthousiasme passionne qu'il eprouvait pour lapremiere fois, et que depuis quelques-heures la jalousie comprimait enlui."O ma belle! o ma sainte! o ma diablesse! o ma reine! s'ecria-t-il,pardonne-moi d'avoir pense a moi-meme au lieu de me prosterner devanttoi pour t'adorer; ainsi que j'aurais du le faire en me retrouvant seulavec toi dans cette chambre! J'en suis sorti ce matin en te querellant.Oui, oui, je devrais n'y etre rentre qu'en me trainant sur mes genoux!Comment peux-tu aimer encore et sourire a une brute telle que moi?Casse-moi ton eventail sur la figure, Consuelo. Mets ton joli pied surma tete. Tu es plus grande que moi de cent coudees, et je suis tonesclave pour jamais, a partir d'aujourd'hui.--Je ne merite pas ces belles paroles, lui repondit-elle ens'abandonnant a ses etreintes; et quant a tes distractions, je lesexcuse, car je les comprends. Je vois bien que la peur d'etre separe demoi, et de voir diviser une vie qui ne peut etre qu'une pour nous deux,t'a seule inspire ce chagrin et ces doutes. Tu as manque de foi enversDieu; c'est bien plus mal que si tu m'avais accusee de quelque lachete.Mais je prierai pour toi, et je dirai: Seigneur, pardonnez-lui comme jelui pardonne."En exprimant son amour avec abandon, simplicite, et en y melant, commetoujours, cette devotion espagnole pleine de tendresse humaine et decompromis ingenus, Consuelo etait si belle; la fatigue et les emotionsde la journee avaient repandu sur elle une langueur si suave,qu'Anzoleto, exalte d'ailleurs par cette espece d'apotheose dont ellesortait et qui la lui montrait sous une face nouvelle, ressentit enfintous les delires d'une passion violente pour cette petite soeur jusquela si paisiblement aimee. Il etait de ces hommes qui ne s'enthousiasmentque pour ce qui est applaudi, convoite et dispute par les autres. Lajoie de sentir en sa possession l'objet de tant de desirs qu'il avaitvus s'allumer et bouillonner autour d'elle, eveilla en lui des desirsirrefrenables; et, pour la premiere fois, Consuelo fut reellement enperil entre ses bras."Sois mon amante, sois ma femme, s'ecria-t-il enfin d'une voix etouffee.Sois a moi tout entiere et pour toujours.--Quand tu voudras, lui repondit Consuelo avec un sourire angelique.Demain si tu veux.--Demain! Et pourquoi demain?--Tu as raison, il est plus de minuit, c'est aujourd'hui que nouspouvons nous marier. Des que le jour sera leve, nous pouvons allertrouver le pretre. Nous n'avons de parents ni l'un ni l'autre, laceremonie ne demandera pas de longs preparatifs. J'ai ma robe d'indienneque je n'ai pas encore mise. Tiens, mon ami, en la faisant, je medisais: Je n'aurai plus d'argent pour acheter ma robe de noces; et simon ami se decidait a m'epouser un de ces jours, je serais forcee deporter a l'eglise la meme qui aurait deja ete etrennee. Cela partemalheur, a ce qu'on dit. Aussi, quand ma mere est venue en reve me laretirer pour la remettre dans l'armoire, elle savait bien ce qu'ellefaisait, la pauvre ame! Ainsi donc tout est pret; demain, au lever dusoleil, nous nous jurerons fidelite. Tu attendais pour cela, mechant,d'etre sur que je n'etais pas laide?--Oh! Consuelo, s'ecria Anzoleto avec angoisse, tu es un enfant, unveritable enfant! Nous ne pouvons nous marier ainsi du jour au lendemainsans qu'on le sache; car le comte et le Porpora, dont la protection nousest encore si necessaire, seraient fort irrites contre nous, si nousprenions cette determination sans les consulter, sans meme les avertir.Ton vieux maitre ne m'aime pas trop, et te comte, je le sais de bonnepart, n'aime pas les cantatrices mariees. Il faudra donc que nousgagnions du temps pour les amener a consentir a notre mariage; ou bienil faut au moins quelques jours, si nous nous marions en secret, pourpreparer mysterieusement cette affaire delicate. Nous ne pouvons pascourir a San-Samuel, ou tout le monde nous connait, et ou il ne faudraque la presence d'une vieille bonne femme pour que toute la paroisse ensoit avertie au bout d'une heure.--Je n'avais pas songe a tout cela, dit Consuelo. Eh bien, de quoi meparlais-tu donc tout a l'heure? Pourquoi, mechant, me disais-tu "Sois mafemme" puisque tu savais que cela n'etait pas encore possible? Ce n'estpas moi qui t'en ai parle la premiere, Anzoleto! Quoique j'aie pensebien souvent que nous etions en age de nous marier, et que je n'eussejamais songe aux obstacles dont tu parles, je m'etais fait un devoir delaisser cette decision a ta prudence, et, faut-il te le dire? a toninspiration; car je voyais bien, que tu n'etais pas trop presse dem'appeler ta femme, et je ne t'en voulais pas. Tu m'as souvent ditqu'avant de s'etablir, il fallait assurer le sort de sa famille future,en s'assurant soi-meme de quelques ressources. Ma mere le disait aussi,et je trouve cela raisonnable. Ainsi, tout bien considere, ce seraitencore trop tot. Il faut que notre engagement a tous deux avec letheatre soit signe, n'est-ce pas? Il faut meme que la faveur du publicnous soit assuree. Nous reparlerons de cela apres nos debuts. Pourquoipalis-tu? mon Dieu, pourquoi serres-tu ainsi les poings, Anzoleto? Nesommes-nous pas bien heureux? Avons-nous besoin d'etre lies par unserment pour nous aimer, et compter l'un sur l'autre?--O Consuelo, que tu es calme, que tu es pure, et que tu es froide!soeecria Anzoleto avec une sorte de rage.--Moi! je suis froide! s'ecria la jeune Espagnole stupefaite etvermeille d'indignation.--Helas! je t'aime comme on peut aimer une femme, et tu m'ecoutes et tume reponds comme un enfant. Tu ne connais que l'amitie, tu ne comprendspas l'amour. Je souffre, je brule, je meurs a tes pieds, et tu me parlesde pretre, de robe et de theatre?"Consuelo, qui s'etait levee avec impetuosite, se rassit confuse et toutetremblante. Elle garda longtemps le silence; et lorsque Anzoleto voulutlui arracher de nouvelles caresses, elle le repoussa doucement."Ecoute, lui dit-elle, il faut s'expliquer et se connaitre. Tu me croistrop enfant en verite, et ce serait une minauderie de ma part, de ne tepas avouer qu'a present je comprends fort bien. Je n'ai pas traverse lestrois quarts de l'Europe avec des gens de toute espece, je n'ai pas vude pres les moeurs libres et sauvages des artistes vagabonds, je n'aipas devine, helas! les secrets mal caches de ma pauvre mere, sans savoirce que toute fille du peuple sait d'ailleurs fort bien a mon age. Maisje ne pouvais pas me decider a croire, Anzoleto, que tu voulussesm'engager a violer un serment fait a Dieu entre les mains de ma meremourante. Je ne tiens pas beaucoup a ce que les patriciennes, dontj'entends quelquefois les causeries, appellent leur reputation. Je suistrop peu de chose dans le monde pour attacher mon honneur au plus oumoins de chastete qu'on voudra bien me supposer; mais je fais consistermon honneur a garder mes promesses, de meme que je fais consister letien a savoir garder les tiennes. Je ne suis peut-etre pas aussi bonnecatholique que je voudrais l'etre. J'ai ete si peu instruite dans lareligion! Je ne puis pas avoir d'aussi belles regles de conduite etd'aussi belles maximes de vertu que ces jeunes filles de la Scuola,elevees dans le cloitre et entretenues du matin au soir dans la sciencedivine. Mais je pratique comme je sais et comme je peux. Je ne crois pasnotre amour capable de s'entacher d'impurete pour devenir un peu plusvif avec nos annees. Je ne compte pas trop les baisers que je te donne,mais je sais que nous n'avons pas desobei a ma mere, et que je ne veuxpas lui desobeir pour satisfaire des impatiences faciles a reprimer.--Faciles! s'ecria Anzoleto en la pressant avec emportement sur sapoitrine; faciles! Je savais bien que tu etais froide.--Froide, tant que tu voudras, repondit-elle en se degageant de sesbras. Dieu, qui lit dans mon coeur, sait bien si je t'aime!--Eh bien! jette-toi donc dans son sein, dit Anzoleto avec depit; car lemien n'est pas un refuge aussi assure, et je m'enfuis pour ne pasdevenir impie."II courut vers la porte, croyant que Consuelo, qui n'avait jamais pu seseparer de lui au milieu d'une querelle, si legere qu'elle fut, sanschercher a le calmer, s'empresserait de le retenir. Elle fiteffectivement un mouvement impetueux pour s'elancer vers lui; puis elles'arreta, le vit sortir, courut aussi vers la porte, mit la main sur leloquet pour ouvrir et le rappeler. Mais, ramenee a sa resolution par uneforce surhumaine, elle tira le verrou sur lui; et, vaincue par une luttetrop violente, elle tomba raide evanouie sur le plancher, ou elle restasans mouvement jusqu'au jour.XIV."Je t'avoue que j'en suis eperdument amoureux, disait cette meme nuit lecomte Zustiniani a son ami Barberigo, vers deux heures du matin, sur lebalcon de son palais, par une nuit obscure et silencieuse.--C'est me signifier que je dois me garder de le devenir, repondit lejeune et brillant Barberigo; et je me soumets, car tes droits primentles miens. Cependant si la Corilla reussissait a te reprendre dans sesfilets, tu aurais la bonte de m'en avertir, et je pourrais alors essayerde me faire ecouler?...--N'y songe pas, si tu m'aimes. La Corilla n'a jamais ete pour moi qu'unamusement. Je vois a ta figure que tu me railles?--Non, mais je pense que c'est un amusement un peu serieux que celui quinous fait faire de telles depenses et de si grandes folies.--Prenons que je porte tant d'ardeur dans mes amusements que rien ne mecoute pour les prolonger. Mais ici c'est plus qu'un desir; c'est, jecrois, une passion Je n'ai jamais vu de creature aussi etrangement belleque cette Consuelo; c'est comme une lampe qui palit de temps en temps,mais qui, au moment ou elle semble prete a s'eteindre, jette une clartesi vive que les astres, comme disent nos poetes, en sont eclipses.--Ah! dit Barberigo en soupirant, cette petite robe noire et cettecollerette blanche, cette toilette a demi pauvre et a demi devote, cettetete pale, calme, sans eclat au premier regard, ces manieres rondes etfranches, cette etonnante absence de coquetterie, comme tout cela setransforme et se divinise lorsqu'elle s'inspire de son propre genie pourchanter! Heureux Zustiniani qui tiens dans tes mains les destinees decette ambition naissante!--Que ne suis-je assure de ce bonheur que tu m'envies! mais je suis touteffraye au contraire de ne trouver la aucune des passions feminines queje connais, et qui sont si faciles a mettre en jeu. Concois-tu, ami, quecelte fille soit restee une enigme pour moi, apres toute une journeed'examen et de surveillance? Il me semble, a sa tranquillite et a mamaladresse, que je suis deja epris au point de ne plus voir clair.--Certes, tu es epris plus qu'il ne faudrait, puisque tu es aveugle.Moi, que l'esperance ne trouble point, je te dirai en trois mots ce quetu ne comprends pas. Consuelo est une fleur d'innocence; elle aime lepetit Anzoleto; elle l'aimera encore pendant quelques jours; et si tubrusques cet attachement d'enfance, tu lui donneras des forcesnouvelles. Mais si tu parais ne point t'en occuper, la comparaisonqu'elle fera entre lui et toi refroidira bientot son amour.--Mais il est beau comme Apollon, ce petit drole, il a une voixmagnifique; il aura du succes. Deja la Corilla en etait folle. Ce n'estpas un rival a dedaigner aupres d'une fille qui a des yeux.--Mais il est pauvre, et tu es riche; inconnu, et tu es tout-puissant,reprit Barberigo. L'important serait de savoir s'il est son amant ou sonami. Dans le premier cas, le desabusement arrivera plus vite queConsuelo; dans le second, il y aura entre eux une lutte, uneincertitude, qui prolongeront tes angoisses.--Il me faudrait donc desirer ce que je crains horriblement, ce qui mebouleverse de rage rien que d'y songer! Toi, qu'en penses-tu?--Je crois qu'ils ne sont point amants.--Mais c'est impossible! L'enfant est libertin, audacieux, bouillant: etpuis les moeurs de ces gens-la!--Consuelo est un prodige en toutes choses. Tu n'es pas bien experimenteencore, malgre tous tes succes aupres des femmes, cher Zustiniani, si tune vois pas dans tous les mouvements, dans toutes les paroles, dans tousles regards de cette fille, qu'elle est aussi pure que le cristal ausein du rocher.--Tu me transportes de joie!--Prends garde! c'est une folie, un prejuge! Si tu aimes Consuelo, ilfaut la marier demain, afin que dans huit jours son maitre lui ait faitsentir le poids d'une chaine, les tourments de la jalousie, l'ennui d'unsurveillant facheux, injuste, et infidele; car le bel Anzoleto sera toutcela. Je l'ai assez observe hier entre la Consuelo et la Clorinda, pouretre a meme de lui prophetiser ses torts et ses malheurs. Suis monconseil, ami, et tu m'en remercieras bientot. Le lien du mariage estfacile a detendre, entre gens de cette condition; et tu sais que, chezces femmes-la, l'amour est une fantaisie ardente qui ne s'exalte qu'avecles obstacles.--Tu me desesperes, repondit le comte, et pourtant je sens que tu asraison."Malheureusement pour les projets du comte Zustiniani, ce dialogue avaitun auditeur sur lequel on ne comptait point et qui n'en perdait pas unesyllabe. Apres avoir quitte Consuelo, Anzoleto, repris de jalousie,etait revenu roder autour du palais de son protecteur, pour s'assurerqu'il ne machinait pas un de ces enlevements si fort a la mode en cetemps-la, et dont l'impunite etait a peu pres garantie aux patriciens.Il ne put en entendre davantage; car la lune, qui commencait a monterobliquement au-dessus des combles du palais, vint dessiner, de plus enplus nette, son ombre sur le pave, et les deux seigneurs, s'apercevantainsi de la presence d'un homme sous le balcon, se retirerent etfermerent la croisee.Anzoleto s'esquiva, et alla rever en liberte a ce qu'il venaitd'entendre. C'en etait bien assez pour qu'il sut a quoi s'en tenir, etpour qu'il fit son profit des vertueux conseils de Barberigo a son ami.Il dormit a peine deux heures vers le matin, puis il courut a la_Corte-Minelli_. La porte etait encore fermee au verrou, mais a traversles fentes de cette barriere mal close, il put voir Consuelo touthabillee, etendue sur son lit, endormie, avec la paleur et l'immobilitede la mort. La fraicheur de l'aube l'avait tiree de son evanouissement,et elle s'etait jetee sur sa couche sans avoir la force de sedeshabiller. Il resta quelques instants a la contempler avec uneinquietude pleine de remords. Mais bientot s'impatientant et s'effrayantde ce sommeil lethargique, si contraire aux vigilantes habitudes de sonamie, il elargit doucement avec son couteau une fente par laquelle ilput passer la lame et faire glisser le verrou. Cela ne reussit pourtantpas sans quelque bruit; mais Consuelo, brisee de fatigue, n'en fut pointeveillee. Il entra donc, referma la porte, et vint s'agenouiller a sonchevet, ou il resta jusqu'a ce qu'elle ouvrit les yeux. En le trouvantla, le premier mouvement de Consuelo fut un cri de joie; mais, retirantaussitot ses bras qu'elle lui avait jetes au cou, elle se recula avec unmouvement d'effroi."Tu me crains donc a present, et, au lieu de m'embrasser, tu veux mefuir! lui dit-il avec douleur. Ah! que je suis cruellement puni de mafaute! Pardonne-moi, Consuelo, et vois si tu dois te mefier de ton ami.Il y a une grande heure que je suis la a te regarder dormir. Oh!pardonne-moi, ma soeur; c'est la premiere et la derniere fois de ta vieque tu auras eu a blamer et a repousser ton frere. Jamais plus jen'offenserai la saintete de notre amour par des emportements coupables.Quitte-moi, chasse-moi, si je manque a mon serment. Tiens, ici, sur tacouche virginale, sur le lit de mort de ta pauvre mere, je te jure de terespecter comme je t'ai respectee jusqu'a ce jour, et de ne pas tedemander un seul baiser, si tu l'exiges, tant que le pretre ne nous aurapas benis. Es-tu contente de moi, chere et sainte Consuelo?".Consuelo ne repondit qu'en pressant la tete blonde du Venitien sur soncoeur et en l'arrosant de larmes. Cette effusion la soulagea; et bientotapres, retombant sur son dur petit oreiller: "Je t'avoue, lui dit-elle,que je suis aneantie; car je n'ai pu fermer l'oeil de toute la nuit.Nous nous etions si mal quittes!--Dors, Consuelo, dors, mon cher ange, repondit Anzoleto; souviens-toide cette, nuit ou tu m'as permis de dormir sur ton lit, pendant que tupriais et que tu travaillais a cette petite table. C'est a mon tour degarder et de proteger ton repos. Dors encore, mon enfant; je vaisfeuilleter ta musique et la lire tout bas, pendant que tu sommeillerasune heure ou deux. Personne ne s'occupera de nous (si on s'en occupeaujourd'hui) avant le soir. Dors donc, et prouve-moi par cette confianceque tu me pardonnes et que tu crois en moi."Consuelo lui repondit par un sourire de beatitude. Il l'embrassa aufront, et s'installa devant la petite table, tandis qu'elle goutait unsommeil bienfaisant entremele des plus doux songes.Anzoleto avait vecu trop longtemps dans un etat de calme et d'innocenceaupres de cette jeune fille, pour qu'il lui fut bien difficile, apres unseul jour d'agitation, de reprendre son role accoutume. C'etait pourainsi dire l'etat normal de son ame que cette affection fraternelle.D'ailleurs ce qu'il avait entendu la nuit precedente, sous le balcon deZustiniani, etait de nature a fortifier ses resolutions: Merci, mesbeaux seigneurs, se disait-il en lui-meme; vous m'avez donne des leconsde morale a votre usage dont le _petit drole_ saura profiter ni plus nimoins qu'un roue de votre classe. Puisque la possession refroiditl'amour, puisque les droits du mariage amenent la satiete et le degout,nous saurons conserver pure cette flamme que vous croyez si facile aeteindre. Nous saurons nous abstenir et de la jalousie, et del'infidelite, et mome des joies de l'amour. Illustre et profondBarberigo, vos propheties portent conseil, et il fait bon d'aller avotre ecole!En songeant ainsi, Anzoleto, vaincu a son tour par la fatigue d'une nuitpresque blanche, s'assoupit de son cote, la tete dans ses mains et lescoudes sur la table. Mais son sommeil fut leger; et, le soleilcommencant a baisser, il se leva pour regarder si Consuelo dormaitencore.Les feux du couchant, penetrant par la fenetre, empourpraient d'unsuperbe reflet le vieux lit et la belle dormeuse. Elle s'etait fait, desa mantille de mousseline blanche, un rideau attache aux pieds ducrucifix de filigrane qui etait cloue au mur au-dessus de sa tete. Cevoile leger retombait avec grace sur son corps souple et admirable deproportions; et dans cette demi-teinte rose, affaissee comme une fleuraux approches du soir, les epaules inondees de ses beaux cheveux sombressur sa peau blanche et mate, les mains jointes sur sa poitrine comme unesainte de marbre blanc sur son tombeau, elle etait si chaste et sidivine, qu'Anzoleto s'ecria dans son coeur: Ah! comte Zustiniani! que nepeux-tu la voir en cet instant, et moi aupres d'elle, gardien jaloux etprudent d'un tresor que tu convoiteras en vain!Au meme instant un faible bruit se fit entendre au dehors; Anzoletoreconnut le clapotement de l'eau au pied de la masure ou etait situee lachambre de Consuelo. Bien rarement les gondoles abordaient a cettepauvre Corte-Minelli; d'ailleurs un demon tenait en eveil les facultesdivinatoires d'Anzoleto. Il grimpa sur une chaise, et atteignit a unepetite lucarne percee pres du plafond sur la face de la maison quebaignait le canaletto. Il vit distinctement le comte Zustiniani sortirde sa barque et interroger les enfants demi-nus qui jouaient sur larive. Il fut incertain s'il eveillerait son amie, ou s'il tiendrait laporte fermee. Mais pendant dix minutes que le comte perdit a demander eta chercher la mansarde de Consuelo, il eut le temps de se faire unsang-froid diabolique et d'aller entr'ouvrir la porte, afin qu'on putentrer sans obstacle et sans bruit; puis il se remit devant la petitetable, prit une plume, et feignit d'ecrire des notes. Son coeur battaitviolemment; mais sa figure etait calme et impenetrable.Le comte entra en effet sur la pointe du pied, se faisant un plaisircurieux de surprendre sa protegee, et se rejouissant de ces apparencesde misere qu'il jugeait etre les meilleures conditions possibles pourfavoriser son plan de corruption. Il apportait l'engagement de Consuelodeja signe de lui, et ne pensait point qu'avec un tel passe-port il dutessuyer un accueil trop farouche. Mais au premier aspect de cesanctuaire etrange, ou une adorable fille dormait du sommeil des anges,sous l'oeil de son amant respectueux ou satisfait, le pauvre Zustinianiperdit contenance, s'embarrassa dans son manteau qu'il portait drape surl'epaule d'un air conquerant, et fit trois pas tout de travers entre lelit et la table sans savoir a qui s'adresser. Anzoleto etait venge de lascene de la veille a l'entree de la gondole."Mon seigneur et maitre! s'ecria-t-il en se levant enfin comme surprispar une visite inattendue: je vais eveiller ma ... fiancee.--Non, lui repondit le comte, deja remis de son trouble, et affectant delui tourner le dos pour regarder Consuelo a son aise. Je suis tropheureux de la voir ainsi. Je te defends de l'eveiller.--Oui, oui, regarde-la bien, pensait Anzoleto; c'est tout ce que jedemandais."--Consuelo ne s'eveilla point; et le comte, baissant la voix, secomposant une figure gracieuse et sereine, exprima son admiration sanscontrainte."Tu avais raison, Zoto, dit-il d'un air aise; Consuelo est la premierechanteuse de l'Italie, et j'avais tort de douter qu'elle fut la plusbelle femme de l'univers.--Votre seigneurie la croyait affreuse, cependant! dit Anzoleto avecmalice.--Tu m'as sans doute accuse aupres d'elle de toutes mes grossieretes?Mais je me reserve de me les faire pardonner par une amende honorable sicomplete, que tu ne pourras plus me nuire en lui rappelant mes torts.--Vous nuire, mon cher seigneur! Ah! comment le pourrais-je, quand memej'en aurais la pensee?"Consuelo s'agita un peu."Laissons-la s'eveiller sans trop de surprise, dit le comte, etdebarrasse-moi cette table pour que je puisse y poser et y relire l'actede son engagement. Tiens, ajouta-t-il lorsque Anzoleto eut obei a sonordre, tu peux jeter les yeux sur ce papier, en attendant qu'elle ouvreles siens.--Un engagement avant l'epreuve des debuts! Mais c'est magnifique, o monnoble patron! Et le debut tout de suite? avant que l'engagement de laCorilla soit expire?--Ceci ne m'embarrasse point. Il y a un dedit de mille sequins avec laCorilla: nous le paierons; la belle affaire!--Mais si la Corilla suscite des cabales?--Nous la ferons mettre aux plombs, si elle cabale.--Vive Dieu! Rien ne gene votre seigneurie.--Oui, Zoto, repondit le comte d'un ton raide, nous sommes comme cela;ce que nous voulons, nous le voulons envers et contre tous.--Et les conditions de l'engagement sont les memes que pour la Corilla?Pour une debutante sans nom, sans gloire, les memes conditions que pourune cantatrice illustre, adoree du public?--La nouvelle cantatrice le sera davantage; et si les conditions del'ancienne ne la satisfont pas, elle n'aura qu'un mot a dire pour qu'ondouble ses appointements. Tout depend d'elle, ajouta-t-il en elevant unpeu la voix, car il s'apercut que la Consuelo s'eveillait: son sort estdans ses mains."Consuelo avait entendu tout ceci dans un demi-sommeil. Quand elle se futfrotte les yeux et assure que ce n'etait point un reve, elle se glissadans sa ruelle sans trop songer a l'etrangete de sa situation, releva sachevelure sans trop s'inquieter de son desordre, s'enveloppa de samantille, et vint avec une confiance ingenue se meler a la conversation."Seigneur comte, dit-elle, c'est trop de bontes; mais je n'aurai pasl'impertinence d'en profiter. Je ne veux pas signer cet engagement avantd'avoir essaye mes forces devant le public; ce ne serait point delicatde ma part. Je peux deplaire, je peux faire _fiasco_, etre sifflee. Queje sois enrouee, troublee, ou bien laide ce jour-la, votre parole seraitengagee, vous seriez trop fier pour la reprendre, et moi trop fiere pouren abuser.--Laide ce jour-la, Consuelo! s'ecria le comte en la regardant avec desyeux enflammes; laide, vous? Tenez, regardez-vous comme vous voila,ajouta-t-il en la prenant par la main et en la conduisant devant sonmiroir. Si vous etes adorable dans ce costume, que serez-vous donc,couverte de pierreries et rayonnante de l'eclat du triomphe?"L'impertinence du comte faisait presque grincer les dents a Anzoleto.Mais l'indifference enjouee avec laquelle Consuelo recevait ses fadeursle calma aussitot."Monseigneur, dit-elle en repoussant le morceau de glace qu'ilapprochait de son visage, prenez garde de casser le reste de mon miroir;je n'en ai jamais eu d'autre, et j'y tiens parce qu'il ne m'a jamaisabusee. Laide ou belle, je refuse vos prodigalites. Et puis je dois vousdire franchement que je ne debuterai pas, et que je ne m'engagerai pas,si mon fiance que voila n'est engage aussi; car je ne veux ni d'un autretheatre ni d'un autre public que le sien. Nous ne pouvons pas nousseparer, puisque nous devons nous marier."Cette brusque declaration etourdit un peu le comte; mais il fut bientotremis."Vous avez raison, Consuelo, repondit-il: aussi mon intention n'est-ellepas de jamais vous separer. Zoto debutera en meme temps que vous.Seulement nous ne pouvons pas nous dissimuler que son talent, bien queremarquable, est encore inferieur au votre....--Je ne crois point cela, monseigneur, repliqua vivement Consuelo enrougissant, comme si elle eut recu une offense personnelle.--Je sais qu'il est votre eleve, beaucoup plus que celui du professeurque je lui ai donne, repondit le comte en souriant. Ne vous en defendezpas, belle Consuelo En apprenant votre intimite, le Porpora s'est ecrie:Je ne m'etonne plus de certaines qualites qu'il possede et que je nepouvais pas concilier avec tant de defauts!--Grand merci au _signor professor!_ dit Anzoleto en riant du bout deslevres.--Il en reviendra, dit Consuelo gaiement. Le public d'ailleurs luidonnera un dementi, a ce bon et cher maitre.--Le bon et cher maitre est le premier juge et le premier connaisseur dela terre en fait de chant, repliqua le comte. Anzoleto profitera encorede vos lecons, et il fera bien. Mais je repete que nous ne pouvons fixerles bases de son engagement, avant d'avoir apprecie le sentiment dupublic a son egard. Qu'il debute donc, et nous verrons a le satisfairesuivant la justice et notre bienveillance, sur laquelle il doit compter.--Qu'il debute donc, et moi aussi, reprit Consuelo; nous sommes auxordres de monsieur le comte. Mais pas de contrat, pas de signature avantl'epreuve, j'y suis determinee....--Vous n'etes pas, satisfaite des conditions que je vous propose,Consuelo? Eh bien, dictez-les vous-meme: tenez, voici la plume, rayez,ajoutez; ma signature est au bas."Consuelo prit la plume. Anzoleto palit; et le comte, qui l'observait,mordit de plaisir le bout de son rabat de dentelle qu'il tortillaitentre ses doigts. Consuelo fit une grande X sur le contrat, et ecrivitsur ce qui restait de blanc au-dessus de la signature du comte:"Anzoleto et Consuelo s'engageront conjointement aux conditions qu'ilplaira a monsieur le comte Zustiniani de leur imposer apres leursdebuts, qui auront lieu le mois prochain au theatre de San-Samuel." Ellesigna rapidement et passa ensuite la plume a son amant."Signe sans regarder, lui dit-elle; tu ne peux faire moins pour prouverta gratitude et ta confiance a ton bienfaiteur."Anzoleto avait lu d'un clin d'oeil avant de signer; lecture et signaturefurent l'affaire d'une demi-minute. Le comte lut par-dessus son epaule."Consuelo, dit-il, vous etes une etrange fille, une admirable creature,en verite! Venez diner tous les deux avec moi," dit-il en dechirant lecontrat et en offrant sa main a Consuelo, qui accepta, mais en le priantd'aller l'attendre avec Anzoleto dans sa gondole, tandis qu'elle feraitun peu de toilette.Decidement, se dit-elle des qu'elle fut seule, j'aurai le moyend'acheter une robe de noces. Elle mit sa robe d'indienne, rajusta sescheveux, et bondit dans l'escalier en chantant a pleine voix une phraseeclatante de force et de fraicheur. Le comte, par exces de courtoisie,avait voulu l'attendre avec Anzoleto sur l'escalier. Elle le croyaitplus loin, et tomba presque dans ses bras. Mais, s'en degageant avecprestesse, elle prit sa main et la porta a ses levres, a la maniere dupays, avec le respect d'une inferieure qui ne veut point escalader lesdistances: puis, se retournant, elle se jeta au cou de son fiance, etalla, toute joyeuse et toute folatre, sauter dans la gondole, sansattendre l'escorte ceremonieuse du protecteur un peu mortifie.XV.Le comte, voyant que Consuelo etait insensible a l'appat du gain, essayade faire jouer les ressorts de la vanite, et lui offrit des bijoux etdes parures: elle les refusa. D'abord Zustiniani s'imagina qu'ellecomprenait ses intentions secretes; mais bientot il s'apercut quec'etait uniquement chez elle une sorte de rustique fierte, et qu'elle nevoulait pas recevoir de recompenses avant de les avoir meritees entravaillant a la prosperite de son theatre. Cependant il lui fitaccepter un habillement complet de satin blanc, en lui disant qu'elle nepouvait pas decemment paraitre dans son salon avec sa robe d'indienne,et qu'il exigeait que, par egard pour lui, elle quittat la livree dupeuple. Elle se soumit, et abandonna sa belle taille aux couturieres ala mode, qui n'en tirerent point mauvais parti et n'epargnerent pointl'etoffe. Ainsi transformee au bout de deux jours en femme elegante,forcee d'accepter aussi un rang de perles fines que le comte luipresenta comme le paiement de la soiree ou elle avait chante devant luiet ses amis, elle fut encore belle, sinon comme il convenait a son genrede beaute, mais comme il fallait qu'elle le devint pour etre comprisepar les yeux vulgaires. Ce resultat ne fut pourtant jamais completementobtenu. Au premier abord, Consuelo ne frappait et n'eblouissaitpersonne. Elle fut toujours pale, et ses habitudes studieuses etmodestes oterent a son regard cet eclat continuel qu'acquierent les yeuxdes femmes dont l'unique pensee est de briller. Le fond de son caracterecomme celui de sa physionomie etait serieux et reflechi. On pouvait laregarder manger, parler de choses indifferentes, s'ennuyer poliment aumilieu des banalites de la vie du monde, sans se douter qu'elle futbelle. Mais que le sourire d'un enjouement qui s'alliait aisement acette serenite de son ame vint effleurer ses traits, on commencait a latrouver agreable. Et puis, qu'elle s'animat davantage, qu'elles'interessat vivement a l'action exterieure, qu'elle s'attendrit,qu'elle s'exaltat, qu'elle entrat dans la manifestation de son sentimentinterieur et dans l'exercice de sa force cachee, elle rayonnait de tousles feux du genie et de l'amour; c'etait un autre reve: on etait ravi,passionne, aneanti a son gre, et sans qu'elle se rendit compte dumystere de sa puissance.Aussi ce que le comte eprouvait pour elle l'etonnait et le tourmentaitetrangement. Il y avait dans cet homme du monde des fibres d'artiste quin'avaient pas encore vibre, et qu'elle faisait fremir de mouvementsinconnus. Mais cette revelation ne pouvait penetrer assez avant dansl'ame du patricien, pour qu'il comprit l'impuissance et la pauvrete desmoyens de seduction qu'il voulait employer aupres d'une femme en toutdifferente de celle qu'il avait su corrompre.Il prit patience, et resolut d'essayer sur elle les effets del'emulation. Il la conduisit dans sa loge au theatre, afin qu'elle vitles succes de la Corilla, et que l'ambition s'eveillat en elle. Mais leresultat de cette epreuve fut fort different de ce qu'il en attendait.Consuelo sortit du theatre froide, silencieuse, fatiguee et non emue dece bruit et de ces applaudissements. La Corilla lui avait paru manquerd'un talent solide, d'une passion noble, d'une puissance de bon aloi.Elle se sentit competente pour juger ce talent factice, force, et dejaruine dans sa source par une vie de desordre et d'egoisme. Elle battitdes mains d'un air impassible, prononca des paroles d'approbationmesuree, et dedaigna de jouer cette vaine comedie d'un genereuxenthousiasme pour une rivale qu'elle ne pouvait ni craindre ni admirer.Un instant, le comte la crut tourmentee d'une secrete jalousie, sinonpour le talent, du moins pour le succes de la prima-donna."Ce succes n'est rien aupres de celui que vous remporterez, lui dit-il;qu'il vous serve seulement a pressentir les triomphes qui vousattendent, si vous etes devant le public ce que vous avez ete devantnous. J'espere que vous n'etes pas effrayee de ce que vous voyez?--Non, seigneur comte, repondit Consuelo en souriant: Ce public nem'effraie pas, car je ne pense pas a lui; je pense au parti qu'on peuttirer de ce role que la Corilla remplit d'une maniere brillante, mais ouil reste a trouver d'autres effets qu'elle n'apercoit point.--Quoi! vous ne pensez pas au public?--Non: je pense a la partition, aux intentions du compositeur, al'esprit du role, a l'orchestre qui a ses qualites et ses defauts, lesuns dont il faut tirer parti, les autres qu'il faut couvrir en sesurpassant a de certains endroits. J'ecoute les choeurs, qui ne sont pastoujours satisfaisants, et qui ont besoin d'une direction plus severe;j'examine les passages ou il faut donner tous ses moyens, par consequentceux auxquels il faudrait se menager. Vous voyez, monsieur le comte, quej'ai a penser a beaucoup de choses avant de penser au public, qui nesait rien de tout cela, et qui ne peut rien m'en apprendre."Cette securite de jugement et cette gravite d'examen surprirenttellement Zustiniani, qu'il n'osa plus lui adresser une seule question,et qu'il se demanda avec effroi quelle prise un galant comme lui pouvaitavoir sur un esprit de cette trempe.L'apparition des deux debutants fut preparee avec toutes les rubriquesusitees en pareille occasion. Ce fut une source de differends et dediscussions continuelles entre le comte et Porpora, entre Consuelo etson amant. Le vieux maitre et sa forte eleve blamaient le charlatanismedes pompeuses annonces et de ces mille vilains petits moyens que nousavons si bien fait progresser en impertinence et en mauvaise foi. AVenise, en ce temps-la, les journaux ne jouaient pas un grand role dansde telles affaires. On ne travaillait pas aussi savamment la compositionde l'auditoire; on ignorait les ressources profondes de la reclame, leshableries du bulletin biographique, et jusqu'aux puissantes machinesappelees claqueurs. Il y avait de fortes brigues, d'ardentes cabales;mais tout cela s'elaborait dans les coteries, et s'operait par la seuleforce d'un public engoue naivement des uns, hostile sincerement auxautres. L'art n'etait pas toujours le mobile. De petites et de grandespassions, etrangeres a l'art et au talent, venaient bien, commeaujourd'hui, batailler dans le temple. Mais on etait moins habile acacher ces causes de discorde, et a les mettre sur le compte d'undilettantisme severe. Enfin c'etait le meme fond aussi vulgairementhumain, avec une surface moins compliquee par la civilisation.Zustiniani menait ces sortes d'affaires en grand seigneur plus qu'endirecteur de spectacle. Son ostentation etait un moteur plus puissantque la cupidite des speculateurs ordinaires. C'etait dans les salonsqu'il preparait son public, et _chauffait_ les succes de sesrepresentations. Ses moyens n'etaient donc jamais bas ni laches; mais ily portait la puerilite de son amour-propre, l'activite de ses passionsgalantes, et le commerage adroit de la bonne compagnie. Il allait doncdemolissant piece a piece, avec assez d'art, l'edifice eleve naguere deses propres mains a la gloire de Corilla. Tout le monde voyait bienqu'il voulait edifier une autre gloire; et comme on lui attribuait lapossession complete de cette pretendue merveille qu'il voulait produire,la pauvre Consuelo ne se doutait pas encore des sentiments du comte pourelle, que deja tout Venise disait que, degoute de la Corilla, il faisaitdebuter a sa place une nouvelle maitresse. Plusieurs ajoutaient: "Grandemystification pour son public, et grand dommage pour son theatre! car safavorite est une petite chanteuse des rues qui ne sait _rien_, et nepossede rien qu'une belle voix et une figure passable."De la des cabales pour la Corilla, qui, de son cote, allait jouant lerole de rivale sacrifiee, et invoquait son nombreux entouraged'adorateurs, afin qu'ils fissent, eux et leurs amis, justice despretentions insolentes de la _Zingarella_ (petite bohemienne). De laaussi des cabales en faveur de la Consuelo, de la part des femmes dontla Corilla avait detourne ou dispute les amants et les maris, ou bien dela part des maris qui souhaitaient qu'un certain groupe de Don Juanvenitiens se serrat autour de la debutante plutot qu'autour de leursfemmes, ou bien encore de la part des amants rebutes ou trahis par laCorilla et qui desiraient de se voir venges par le triomphe d'une autre.Quant aux veritables _dilettanti di musica_, ils etaient egalementpartages entre le suffrage des maitres serieux, tels que le Porpora,Marcello, Jomelli, etc., qui annoncaient, avec le debut d'une excellentemusicienne, le retour des bonnes traditions et des bonnes partitions; etle depit des compositeurs secondaires, dont la Corilla avait toujoursprefere les oeuvres faciles, et qui se voyaient menaces dans sapersonne. Les musiciens de l'orchestre, qu'on menacait aussi de remettrea des partitions depuis longtemps negligees, et de faire travaillerserieusement; tout le personnel du theatre, qui prevoyait les reformesresultant toujours d'un notable changement dans la composition de latroupe; enfin jusqu'aux machinistes des decorations, aux habilleuses desactrices et au perruquier des figurantes, tout etait en rumeur autheatre San-Samuel, pour ou contre le debut; et il est vrai de direqu'on s'en occupait beaucoup plus dans la republique que des actes de lanouvelle administration du doge Pietro Grimaldi, lequel venait desucceder paisiblement a son predecesseur le doge Luigi Pisani.Consuelo s'affligeait et s'ennuyait profondement de ces lenteurs et deces miseres attachees a sa carriere naissante. Elle eut voulu debutertout de suite, sans preparation autre que celle de ses propres moyens etde l'etude de la piece nouvelle. Elle ne comprenait rien a ces milleintrigues qui lui semblaient plus dangereuses qu'utiles, et dont ellesentait bien qu'elle pouvait se passer. Mais le comte, qui voyait deplus pres les secrets du metier, et qui voulait etre envie et non bafouedans son bonheur imaginaire aupres d'elle, n'epargnait rien pour luifaire des partisans. Il la faisait venir tous les jours chez lui, et lapresentait a toutes les aristocraties de la ville et de la campagne. Lamodestie et la souffrance interieure de Consuelo secondaient mal sesdesseins; mais il la faisait chanter, et la victoire etait brillante,decisive, incontestable.Anzoleto etait loin de partager la repugnance de son amie pour lesmoyens secondaires. Son succes a lui n'etait pas a beaucoup pres aussiassure. D'abord le comte n'y portait pas la meme ardeur; ensuite letenor auquel il allait succeder etait un talent de premier ordre, qu'ilne pouvait point se flatter de faire oublier aisement. Il est vrai quetous les soirs il chantait aussi chez le comte; que Consuelo, dans lesduos, le faisait admirablement ressortir, et que, pousse et soutenu parl'entrainement magnetique de ce genie superieur au sien, il s'elevaitsouvent a une grande hauteur. Il etait donc fort applaudi et fortencourage. Mais apres la surprise que sa belle voix excitait a lapremiere audition, apres surtout que Consuelo s'etait revelee, onsentait bien les imperfections du debutant, et il les sentait lui-memeavec effroi. C'etait le moment de travailler avec une fureur nouvelle;mais en vain Consuelo l'y exhortait et lui donnait rendez-vous chaquematin a la _Corte-Minelli_, ou elle s'obstinait a demeurer, en depit desprieres du comte, qui voulait l'etablir plus convenablement: Anzoleto selancait dans tant de demarches, de visites, de sollicitations etd'intrigues, il se preoccupait de tant de soucis et d'anxietesmiserables, qu'il ne lui restait ni temps ni courage pour etudier.Au milieu de ces perplexites, prevoyant que la plus forte opposition ason succes viendrait de la Corilla, sachant que le comte ne la voyaitplus et ne s'occupait d'elle en aucune facon, il se resolut a l'allervoir afin de se la rendre favorable. Il avait oui dire qu'elle prenaittres gaiement et avec une ironie philosophique l'abandon et lesvengeances de Zustiniani; qu'elle avait recu de brillantes propositionsde la part de l'Opera italien de Paris, et qu'en attendant l'echec de sarivale, sur lequel elle paraissait compter, elle riait a gorge deployeedes illusions du comte et de son entourage. Il pensa qu'avec de laprudence et de la faussete il desarmerait cette ennemie redoutable; et,s'etant pare et parfume de son mieux, il penetra dans ses appartements,un apres-midi, a l'heure ou l'habitude de la sieste rend les visitesrares et les palais silencieux.XVI.Il trouva la Corilla seule, dans un boudoir exquis, assoupie encore sursa chaise longue, et dans un deshabille des plus galants, comme ondisait alors; mais l'alteration de ses traits au grand jour lui fitpenser que sa securite n'etait pas aussi profonde sur le chapitre deConsuelo, que voulaient bien le dire ses partisans fideles. Neanmoinselle le recut d'un air fort enjoue, et lui frappant la joue avec malice:"Ah! ah! c'est toi, petit fourbe? lui dit-elle en faisant signe a sasuivante de sortir et de fermer la porte; viens-tu encore m'en conter,et te flattes-tu de me faire croire que tu n'es pas le plus traitre desconteurs de fleurettes, et le plus intrigant des postulants a la gloire?Vous etes un maitre fat, mon bel ami, si vous avez cru me desesperer parvotre abandon subit, apres de si tendres declarations; et vous avez eteun maitre sot de vous faire desirer: car je vous ai parfaitement oublieau bout de vingt-quatre heures d'attente.--Vingt-quatre heures! c'est immense, repondit Anzoleto en baisant lebras lourd et puissant de la Corilla. Ob! si je le croyais, je seraisbien orgueilleux; mais je sais bien que si je m'etais abuse au point devous croire lorsque vous me disiez....--Ce que je te disais, je te conseille de l'oublier aussi; et si tuetais venu me voir, tu aurais trouve ma porte fermee. Mais qui te donnel'impudence de venir aujourd'hui?.--N'est-il pas de bon gout de s'abstenir de prosternations devant ceuxqui sont dans la faveur, et de venir apporter son coeur et sondevouement a ceux qui....--Acheve! a ceux qui sont dans la disgrace? C'est bien genereux et treshumain de ta part, mon illustre ami." Et la Corilla se renversa sur sonoreiller de satin noir, en poussant des eclats de rire aigus et tantsoit peu forces.Quoique la prima-donna disgraciee ne fut pas de la premiere fraicheur,que la clarte de midi ne lui fut pas tres favorable, et que le depitconcentre de ces derniers temps eut un peu amolli les plans de son beauvisage, florissant d'embonpoint, Anzoleto, qui n'avait jamais vu de sipres en tete-a-tete une femme si paree et si renommee, se sentitemouvoir dans les regions de son ame ou Consuelo n'avait pas vouludescendre, et d'ou il avait banni volontairement sa pure image. Leshommes corrompus avant l'age peuvent encore ressentir l'amitie pour unefemme honnete et sans art; mais pour ranimer leurs passions, il faut lesavances d'une coquette. Anzoleto conjura les railleries de la Corillapar les temoignages d'un amour qu'il s'etait promis de feindre et qu'ilcommenca a ressentir veritablement. Je dis amour, faute d'un mot plusconvenable; mais c'est profaner un si beau nom que de l'appliquer al'attrait qu'inspirent des femmes froidement provoquantes comme l'etaitla Corilla. Quand elle vit que le jeune tenor etait emu tout de bon,elle s'adoucit, et le railla plus amicalement."Tu m'as plu tout un soir, je le confesse, dit-elle, mais au fond je net'estime pas. Je te sais ambitieux, par consequent faux, et pret atoutes les infidelites: je ne saurais me fier a toi. Tu fis le jaloux,une certaine nuit dans ma gondole; tu te posas comme un despote. Celam'eut desennuyee des fades galanteries de nos patriciens; mais tu metrompais, lache enfant! tu etais epris d'une autre, et tu n'as pas cessede l'etre, et tu vas epouser ... qui!... Oh! je le sais fort bien, marivale, mon ennemie, la debutante, la nouvelle maitresse de Zustiniani.Honte a nous deux, a nous trois, a nous quatre! ajouta-t-elle ens'animant malgre elle et en retirant sa main de celles d'Anzoleto.--Cruelle, lui dit-il en s'efforcant de ressaisir cette main potelee,vous devriez comprendre ce qui s'est passe en moi lorsque je vous vispour la premiere fois, et ne pas vous soucier de ce qui m'occupait avantce moment terrible. Quant a ce qui s'est passe depuis, ne pouvez-vous ledeviner, et avons-nous besoin d'y songer desormais?--Je ne me paie pas de demi-mots et de reticences. Tu aimes toujours lazingarella tu l'epouses?--Et si je l'aimais, comment se fait-il que je ne l'aie pas encoreepousee?--Parce que le comte s'y opposait peut-etre. A present, chacun saitqu'il le desire. On dit meme qu'il a sujet d'en etre impatient, et lapetite encore plus."Le rouge monta a la figure d'Anzoleto en entendant ces outragesprodigues a l'etre qu'il venerait en lui-meme au-dessus de tout.--Ah! tu es outre de mes suppositions, repondit la Corilla, c'est bon;voila ce que je voulais savoir. Tu l'aimes; et quand l'epouses-tu?--Je ne l'epouse point du tout.--Alors vous partagez? Tu es bien avant dans la faveur de monsieur lecomte!--Pour l'amour du ciel, madame, ne parlons ni du comte, ni de personneautre que de vous et de moi.--Eh bien, soit, dit la Corilla. Aussi bien a cette heure, mon ex-amantet ta future epouse ..."Anzoleto etait indigne. Il se leva pour sortir. Mais qu'allait-il faire?allumer de plus en plus la haine de cette femme, qu'il etait venucalmer. Il resta indecis, horriblement humilie et malheureux du rolequ'il s'etait impose.La Corilla brulait d'envie de le rendre infidele; non qu'elle l'aimat,mais parce que c'etait une maniere de se venger de cette Consueloqu'elle n'etait pas certaine d'avoir outragee, avec justice."Tu vois bien, lui dit-elle en l'enchainant au seuil de son boudoir, parun regard penetrant, que j'ai raison de me mefier de toi: car en cemoment tu trompes quelqu'un ici. Est-ce _elle_ ou moi?--Ni l'une ni l'autre, s'ecria-t-il en cherchant a se justifier a sespropres yeux; je ne suis point son amant, je ne le fus jamais. Je n'aipas d'amour pour elle; car je ne suis pas jaloux du comte.--En voici bien d'une autre! Ah! tu es jaloux au point de le nier, et tuviens ici pour te guerir ou te distraire? grand merci!--Je ne suis point jaloux, je vous le repete; et pour vous prouver quece n'est pas le depit qui me fait parler, je vous dis que le comte n'estpas plus son amant que moi; qu'elle est honnete comme un enfant qu'elleest, et que le seul coupable envers vous, c'est le comte Zustiniani.--Ainsi, je puis faire siffler la zingarella sans t'affliger? Tu serasdans ma loge et tu la siffleras, et en sortant de la tu seras mon uniqueamant. Accepte vite, ou je me retracte.--Helas, madame, vous voulez donc m'empecher de debuter? car vous savezbien que je dois debuter en meme temps que la Consuelo? Si vous lafaites siffler, moi qui chanterai avec elle, je tomberai donc, victimede votre courroux? Et qu'ai-je fait, malheureux que je suis, pour vousdeplaire? Helas! j'ai fait un reve delicieux et funeste! je me suisimagine tout un soir que vous preniez quelque interet a moi, et que jegrandirais sous votre protection. Et voila que je suis l'objet de votremepris et de votre haine, moi qui vous ai aimee et respectee au point devous fuir! Eh bien, madame, contentez votre aversion. Faites-moi tomber,perdez-moi, fermez-moi la carriere. Pourvu qu'ici en secret vous medisiez que je ne vous suis point odieux, j'accepterai les marquespubliques de votre courroux.--Serpent que tu es, s'ecria la Corilla, ou as-tu suce le poison de laflatterie que ta langue et tes yeux distillent? Je donnerais beaucouppour te connaitre et te comprendre; mais je te crains, car tu es le plusaimable des amants ou le plus dangereux des ennemis.--Moi, votre ennemi! Et comment oserais-je jamais me poser ainsi, quandmeme je ne serais pas subjugue par vos charmes? Est-ce que vous avez desennemis, divine Corilla? Est-ce que vous pouvez en avoir a Venise, oul'on vous connait et ou vous avez toujours regne sans partage? Unequerelle d'amour jette le comte dans un depit douloureux. Il veut vouseloigner, il veut cesser de souffrir. Il rencontre sur son chemin unepetite fille qui semble montrer quelques moyens et qui ne demande pasmieux que de debuter. Est-ce un crime de la part d'une pauvre enfant quin'entend prononcer votre nom illustre qu'avec terreur, et qui ne leprononce elle-meme qu'avec respect? Vous attribuez a cette pauvrette despretentions insolentes qu'elle ne saurait avoir. Les efforts du comtepour la faire gouter a ses amis, l'obligeance de ces memes amis qui vontexagerant son merite, l'amertume des votres qui repandent des calomniespour vous aigrir et vous affliger, tandis qu'ils devraient rendre lecalme a votre belle ame en vous montrant votre gloire inattaquable etvotre rivale tremblante; voila les causes de ces preventions que jedecouvre en vous, et dont je suis si etonne, si stupefait, que je sais apeine comment m'y prendre pour les combattre.--Tu ne le sais que trop bien, langue maudite, dit la Corilla en leregardant avec un attendrissement voluptueux, encore mele de defiance;j'ecoute tes douces paroles, mais ma raison me dit encore de teredouter. Je gage que cette Consuelo est divinement belle, quoiqu'onm'ait dit le contraire, et qu'elle a du merite dans un certain genreoppose au mien, puisque le Porpora, que je connais si severe, leproclame hautement.--Vous connaissez le Porpora? donc vous savez ses bizarreries, sesmanies, on peut dire. Ennemi de toute originalite chez les autres et detoute innovation dans l'art du chant, qu'une petite eleve soit bienattentive a ses radotages, bien soumise a ses pedantesques lecons, levoila qui, pour une gamme vocalisee proprement, declare que cela estpreferable a toutes les merveilles que le public idolatre. Depuis quandvous tourmentez-vous des lubies de ce vieux fou?--Elle est donc sans talent?--Elle a une belle voix, et chante honnetement a l'eglise; mais elle nedoit rien savoir du theatre, et quant a la puissance qu'il y faudraitdeployer, elle est tellement paralysee par la peur, qu'il est fort acraindre qu'elle y perde le peu de moyens que le ciel lui a donnes.--Elle a peur! On m'a dit qu'elle etait au contraire d'une rareimpudence.--Oh! la pauvre fille! helas, on lui en veut donc bien? Vousl'entendrez, divine Corilla, et vous serez emue d'une noble pitie, etvous l'encouragerez au lieu de la faire siffler, comme vous le disiez enraillant tout a l'heure.--Ou tu me trompes, ou mes amis m'ont bien trompee sur son compte.--Vos amis se sont laisse tromper eux-memes. Dans leur zele indiscret,ils se sont effrayes de vous voir une rivale: effrayes d'un enfant!effrayes pour vous! Ah! que ces gens-la vous aiment mal, puisqu'ils vousconnaissent si peu! Oh! si j'avais le bonheur d'etre votre ami, jesaurais mieux ce que vous etes, et je ne vous ferais pas l'injure dem'effrayer pour vous d'une rivalite quelconque, fut-ce celle d'uneFaustina ou d'une Molteni.--Ne crois pas que j'aie ete effrayee. Je ne suis ni jalouse nimechante; et les succes d'autrui n'ayant jamais fait de tort aux miens,je ne m'en suis jamais affligee. Mais quand je crois qu'on veut mebraver et me faire souffrir....--Voulez-vous que j'amene la petite Consuelo a vos pieds? Si elle l'eutose, elle serait venue deja vous demander votre appui et vos conseils.Mais c'est un enfant si timide! Et puis, on vous a calomniee aussiaupres d'elle. A elle aussi on est venu dire que vous etiez cruelle,vindicative, et que vous comptiez la faire tomber.--On lui a dit cela? En ce cas je comprends pourquoi tu es ici.--Non, madame, vous ne le comprenez pas; car je ne l'ai pas cru uninstant, je ne le croirai jamais. Oh! non, madame! vous ne me comprenezpas!"En parlant ainsi, Anzoleto fit scintiller ses yeux noirs, et flechit legenou devant la Corilla avec une expression de langueur et d'amourincomparable.La Corilla n'etait pas depourvue de malice et de penetration; mais,comme il arrive aux femmes excessivement eprises d'elles-memes, lavanite lui mettait souvent un epais bandeau sur les yeux, et la faisaittomber dans des pieges fort grossiers. D'ailleurs elle etait d'humeurgalante. Anzoleto etait le plus beau garcon qu'elle eut jamais vu. Ellene put resister a ses mielleuses paroles, et peu a peu, apres avoirgoute avec lui le plaisir de la vengeance, elle s'attacha a lui par lesplaisirs de la possession. Huit jours apres cette premiere entrevue,elle en etait folle, et menacait a tout moment de trahir le secret deleur intimite par des jalousies et des emportements terribles. Anzoleto,epris d'elle aussi d'une certaine facon (sans que son coeur put reussira etre infidele a Consuelo), etait fort effraye du trop rapide et tropcomplet succes de son entreprise. Cependant il se flattait de la dominerassez longtemps pour en venir a ses fins, c'est-a-dire pour l'empecherde nuire a ses debuts et au succes de Consuelo. Il deployait avec elleune grande habilete, et possedait l'art d'exprimer le mensonge avec unair de verite diabolique. Il sut l'enchainer, la persuader, et lareduire; il vint a bout de lui faire croire que ce qu'il aimaitpar-dessus tout dans une femme c'etait la generosite, la douceur et ladroiture; et il lui traca finement le role qu'elle avait a jouer devantle public avec Consuelo, si elle ne voulait etre haie et meprisee parlui-meme. Il sut etre severe avec tendresse; et, masquant la menace sousla louange, il feignit de la prendre pour un ange de bonte. La pauvreCorilla avait joue tous les roles dans son boudoir, excepte celui-la; etcelui-la, elle l'avait toujours mal joue sur la scene. Elle s'y soumitpourtant, dans la crainte de perdre des voluptes dont elle n'etait pasencore rassasiee, et que, sous divers pretextes, Anzoleto sut luimenager et lui rendre desirables. Il lui fit croire que le comte etaittoujours epris d'elle, malgre son depit, et secretement jaloux en sevantant du contraire."S'il venait a decouvrir le bonheur que je goute pres de toi, luidisait-il, c'en serait fait de mes debuts et peut-etre de mon avenir:car je vois a son refroidissement, depuis le jour ou tu as eul'imprudence de trahir mon amour pour toi, qu'il me poursuivraiteternellement de sa haine s'il savait que je t'ai consolee."Cela etait peu vraisemblable, au point ou en etaient les choses; lecomte eut ete charme de savoir Anzoleto infidele a sa fiancee. Mais lavanite de Corilla aimait a se laisser abuser. Elle crut aussi n'avoirrien a craindre des sentiments d'Anzoleto pour la debutante. Lorsqu'ilse justifiait sur ce point, et jurait par tous les dieux n'avoir etejamais que le frere de cette jeune fille, comme il disait materiellementla verite, il y avait tant d'assurance dans ses denegations que lajalousie de Corilla etait vaincue. Enfin le grand jour approchait, et lacabale qu'elle avait preparee etait aneantie. Pour son compte, elletravaillait desormais en sens contraire, persuadee que la timide etinexperimentee Consuelo tomberait d'elle-meme, et qu'Anzoleto luisaurait un gre infini de n'y avoir pas contribue. En outre, il avaitdeja eu le talent de la brouiller avec ses plus fermes champions, enfeignant d'etre jaloux de leurs assiduites, et en la forcant a leseconduire un peu brusquement.Tandis qu'il travaillait ainsi dans l'ombre a dejouer les esperances dela femme qu'il pressait chaque nuit dans ses bras, le ruse Venitienjouait un autre role avec le comte et Consuelo. Il se vantait a euxd'avoir desarme par d'adroites demarches, des visites interessees, etdes mensonges effrontes, la redoutable ennemie de leur triomphe. Lecomte, frivole et un peu commere, s'amusait infiniment des contes de sonprotege. Son amour-propre triomphait des regrets que celui-ci attribuaita la Corilla par rapport a leur rupture, et il poussait ce jeune homme ade laches perfidies avec cette legerete cruelle qu'on porte dans lesrelations du theatre et la galanterie. Consuelo s'en etonnait et s'enaffligeait:"Tu ferais mieux, lui disait-elle, de travailler ta voie et d'etudierton role. Tu crois avoir fait beaucoup en desarmant l'ennemi. Mais unenote bien epuree, une inflexion bien sentie, feraient beaucoup plus surle public impartial que le silence des envieux. C'est a ce public seulqu'il faudrait songer, et je vois avec chagrin que tu n'y songesnullement.--Sois donc tranquille, chere Consuelita, lui repondait-il. Ton erreurest de croire a un public a la fois impartial et eclaire. Les gens quis'y connaissent ne sont presque jamais de bonne foi, et ceux qui sont debonne foi s'y connaissent si peu qu'il suffit d'un peu d'audace pour leseblouir et les entrainer.XVII.La jalousie d'Anzoleto a l'egard du comte s'etait endormie au milieu desdistractions que lui donnaient la soif du succes et les ardeurs de laCorilla. Heureusement Consuelo n'avait pas besoin d'un defenseur plusmoral et plus vigilant. Preservee par sa propre innocence, elleechappait encore aux hardiesses de Zustiniani et le tenait a distance,precisement par le peu de souci qu'elle en prenait. Au bout de quinzejours, ce roue Venitien avait reconnu qu'elle n'avait point encore lespassions mondaines qui menent a la corruption, et il n'epargnait rienpour les faire eclore. Mais comme, a cet egard meme, il n'etait pas plusavance que le premier jour, il ne voulait point ruiner ses esperancespar trop d'empressement. Si Anzoleto l'eut contrarie par sasurveillance, peut-etre le depit l'eut-il pousse a brusquer les choses;mais Anzoleto lui laissait le champ libre, Consuelo ne se mefiait derien: tout ce qu'il avait a faire, c'etait de se rendre agreable, enattendant qu'il devint necessaire. Il n'y avait donc sorte deprevenances delicates, de galanteries raffinees, dont il ne s'ingeniatpour plaire. Consuelo recevait toutes ces idolatries en s'obstinant ales mettre sur le compte des moeurs elegantes et liberales du patriciat,du dilettantisme passionne et de la bonte naturelle de son protecteur.Elle eprouvait pour lui une amitie vraie, une sainte reconnaissance; etlui, heureux et inquiet de cet abandon d'une ame pure, commencait as'effrayer du sentiment qu'il inspirerait lorsqu'il voudrait rompreenfin la glace.Tandis qu'il se livrait avec crainte, et non sans douceur a un sentimenttout nouveau pour lui (se consolant un peu de ses mecomptes parl'opinion ou tout Venise etait de son triomphe), la Corilla sentaits'operer en elle aussi une sorte de transformation. Elle aimait sinonavec noblesse, du moins avec ardeur; et son ame irritable et imperieusepliait sous le joug de son jeune Adonis. C'etait bien vraimentl'impudique Venus eprise du chasseur superbe, et pour la premiere foishumble et craintive devant un mortel prefere. Elle se soumettait jusqu'afeindre des vertus qui n'etaient point en elle, et qu'elle n'affectaitcependant point sans en ressentir une sorte d'attendrissement voluptueuxet doux; tant il est vrai que l'idolatrie qu'on se retire a soi-meme,pour la reporter sur un autre etre, eleve et ennoblit par instants lesames les moins susceptibles de grandeur et de devouement.L'emotion qu'elle eprouvait reagissait sur son talent, et l'onremarquait au theatre qu'elle jouait avec plus de naturel et desensibilite les roles pathetiques. Mais comme son caractere et l'essencememe de sa nature etaient pour ainsi dire brises, comme il fallait unecrise interieure violente et penible pour operer cette metamorphose, saforce physique succombait dans la lutte; et chaque jour on s'apercevaitavec surprise, les uns avec une joie maligne, les autres avec un effroiserieux, de la perte de ses moyens. Sa voix s'eteignait a chaqueinstant. Les brillants caprices de son improvisation etaient trahis parune respiration courte et des intonations hasardees. Le deplaisir et laterreur qu'elle en ressentait achevaient de l'affaiblir; et, a larepresentation qui preceda les debuts de Consuelo, elle chanta tellementfaux et manqua tant de passages eclatants, que ses amis l'applaudirentfaiblement et furent bientot reduits au silence de la consternation parles murmures des opposants.Enfin ce grand jour arriva, et la salle fut si remplie qu'on y pouvait apeine respirer. Corilla, vetue de noir, pale, emue, plus morte que vive,partagee entre la crainte de voir tomber son amant et celle de voirtriompher sa rivale, alla s'asseoir au fond de sa petite loge obscuresur le theatre. Tout le ban et l'arriere-ban des aristocraties et desbeautes de Venise vinrent etaler les fleurs et les pierreries en untriple hemicycle etincelant. Les hommes _charmants_ encombraient lescoulisses et, comme c'etait alors l'usage, une partie du theatre. Ladogaresse se montra a l'avant-scene avec tous les grands dignitaires dela republique. Le Porpora dirigea l'orchestre en personne, et le comteZustiniani attendit a la porte de la loge de Consuelo qu'elle eut achevesa toilette, tandis qu'Anzoleto, pare en guerrier antique avec toute lacoquetterie bizarre de l'epoque, s'evanouissait dans la coulisse etavalait un grand verre de vin de Chypre pour se remettre sur ses jambes.L'opera n'etait ni d'un classique ni d'un novateur, ni d'un anciensevere ni d'un moderne audacieux. C'etait l'oeuvre inconnue d'unetranger. Pour echapper aux cabales que son propre nom, ou tout autrenom celebre, n'eut pas manque de soulever chez les compositeurs rivaux,le Porpora desirant, avant tout, le succes de son eleve, avait proposeet mis a l'etude la partition d'_Ipermnestre_, debut lyrique d'un jeuneAllemand qui n'avait encore en Italie, et nulle part au monde, niennemis, ni seides, et qui s'appelait tout simplement monsieurChristophe Gluck.Lorsque Anzoleto parut sur la scene, un murmure d'admiration courut danstoute la salle. Le tenor auquel il succedait, admirable chanteur, quiavait eu le tort d'attendre pour prendre sa retraite que l'age eutextenue sa voix et enlaidi son visage, etait peu regrette d'un publicingrat; et le beau sexe, qui ecoute plus souvent avec les yeux qu'avecles oreilles, fut ravi de voir, a la place de ce gros homme bourgeonne,un garcon de vingt-quatre ans, frais comme une rose, blond comme Phebus,bati comme si Phidias s'en fut mele, un vrai fils des lagunes: _Bianco,crespo, e grassotto_.Il etait trop emu pour bien chanter son premier air, mais sa voixmagnifique, ses belles poses, quelques traits heureux et neufs suffirentpour lui conquerir l'engouement des femmes et des indigenes. Le debutantavait de grands moyens, de l'avenir: il fut applaudi a trois reprises etrappele deux fois sur la scene apres etre rentre dans la coulisse, commecela se pratique en Italie et a a Venise plus que partout ailleurs.Ce succes lui rendit le courage; et lorsqu'il reparut avec_Ipermnestre_, il n'avait plus peur. Mais tout l'effet de cette sceneetait pour Consuelo: on ne voyait, on n'ecoutait plus qu'elle. On sedisait: "La voila; oui, c'est elle! Qui? L'Espagnole? Oui, ladebutante, l'_amante del Zustiniani_."Consuelo entra gravement et froidement. Elle fit des yeux le tour de sonpublic, recut les salves d'applaudissements de ses protecteurs avec unereverence sans humilite et sans coquetterie, et entonna son recitatifd'une voix si ferme, avec un accent si grandiose, et une securite sivictorieuse, qu'a la premiere phrase des cris d'admiration partirent detous les points de la salle."Ah! le perfide s'est joue de moi," s'ecria la Corilla en lancant unregard terrible a Anzoleto, qui ne put s'empecher en cet instant delever les yeux vers elle avec un sourire mal deguise.Et elle se rejeta au fond de sa loge, en fondant en larmes.Consuelo dit encore quelques phrases. On entendit la voix cassee duvieux Lotti qui disait dans son coin: "_Amici miei, questo e unportento!_"Elle chanta son grand air de debut, et fut interrompue dix fois; on cria_bis!_ on la rappela sept fois sur la scene; il y eut des hurlementsd'enthousiasme. Enfin la fureur du dilettantisme venitien s'exhala danstoute sa fougue a la fois entrainante et ridicule."Qu'ont-ils donc a crier ainsi? dit Consuelo en rentrant dans lacoulisse pour en etre arrachee aussitot par les vociferations duparterre: on dirait qu'ils veulent me lapider."De ce moment on ne s'occupa plus que tres secondairement d'Anzoleto. Onle traita bien, parce qu'on etait en veine de satisfaction; mais lafroideur indulgente avec laquelle on laissa passer les endroitsdefectueux de son chant, sans le consoler immoderement a ceux ou il s'enreleva, lui prouva que si sa figure plaisait aux femmes, la majoriteexpansive et bruyante, le public masculin faisait bon marche de lui etreservait ses tempetes d'exaltation pour la prima-donna. Parmi tous ceuxqui etaient venus avec des intentions hostiles, il n'y en eut pas un quihasarda un murmure, et la verite est qu'il n'y en eut pas trois quiresisterent a l'entrainement et au besoin invincible d'applaudir lamerveille du jour.La partition eut le plus grand succes, quoiqu'elle ne fut point ecouteeet que personne ne s'occupat de la musique en elle-meme. C'etait unemusique tout italienne, gracieuse, moderement pathetique, et qui nefaisait point encore pressentir, dit-on, l'auteur d'_Alceste_ etd'_Orphee_. Il n'y avait pas assez de beautes frappantes pour choquerl'auditoire. Des le premier entr'acte, le maestro allemand fut rappeledevant le rideau avec le debutant, la debutante, voire la Clorinda qui,grace a la protection de Consuelo, avait nasille le second role d'unevoix pateuse et avec un accent commun, mais dont les beaux bras avaientdesarme tout le monde: la Rosalba, qu'elle remplacait, etait fortmaigre.Au dernier entracte, Anzoleto, qui surveillait Corilla a la derobee etqui s'etait apercu de son agitation croissante, jugea prudent d'aller latrouver dans sa loge pour prevenir quelque explosion. Aussitot qu'ellel'apercut, elle se jeta sur lui comme une tigresse, et lui appliqua deuxou trois vigoureux soufflets, dont le dernier se termina d'une maniereassez crochue pour faire couler quelques gouttes de sang et laisser unemarque que le rouge et le blanc ne purent ensuite couvrir. Le tenoroutrage mit ordre a ces emportements par un grand coup de poing dans lapoitrine, qui fit tomber la cantatrice a demi pamee dans les bras de sasoeur Rosalba."Infame, traitre, _buggiardo!_ murmura-t-elle d'une voix etouffee; taConsuelo et toi ne perirez que de ma main.--Si tu as le malheur de faire un pas, un geste, une inconvenancequelconque ce soir, je te poignarde a la face de Venise, reponditAnzoleto pale et les dents serrees, en faisant briller devant ses yeuxson couteau fidele qu'il savait lancer avec toute la dexterite d'unhomme des lagunes.--Il le ferait comme il le dit, murmura la Rosalba epouvantee. Tais-toi;allons-nous-en, nous sommes ici en danger de mort.--Oui, vous y etes, ne l'oubliez pas," repondit Anzoleto; et seretirant, il poussa la porte de la loge avec violence en les y enfermanta double tour.Bien que cette scene tragi-comique se fut passee a la maniere venitiennedans un mezzo-voce mysterieux et rapide, en voyant le debutant traverserrapidement les coulisses pour regagner sa loge la joue cachee dans sonmouchoir, on se douta de quelque mignonne bisbille; et le perruquier,qui fut appele a rajuster les boucles de la coiffure du prince grec et areplatrer sa cicatrice, raconta a toute la bande des choristes et descomparses, qu'une chatte amoureuse avait joue des griffes sur la face duheros. Ledit perruquier se connaissait a ces sortes de blessures, etn'etait pas novice confident de pareilles aventures de coulisse.L'anecdote fit le tour de la scene, sauta, je ne sais comment,par-dessus la rampe, et alla se promener de l'orchestre aux balcons, etde la dans les loges, d'ou elle redescendit, un peu grossie en chemin,jusque dans les profondeurs du parterre. On ignorait encore lesrelations d'Anzoleto avec Corilla; mais quelques personnes l'avaient vuempresse en apparence aupres de la Clorinda, et le bruit general fut quela _seconda-donna_, jalouse de la _prima-donna_, venait de crever unoeil et de casser trois dents au plus beau des _tenori_.Ce fut une desolation pour les uns (je devrais dire les unes), et undelicieux petit scandale pour la plupart. On se demandait si larepresentation serait suspendue, si on verrait reparaitre le vieux tenorStefanini pour achever le role, un cahier a la main. La toile se releva,et tout fut oublie lorsqu'on vit revenir Consuelo aussi calme et aussisublime qu'au commencement. Quoique son role ne fut pas extremementtragique, elle le rendit tel par la puissance de son jeu et l'expressionde son chant. Elle fit verser des larmes; et quand le tenor reparut, samince egratignure n'excita qu'un sourire. Mais cet incident ridiculeempecha cependant son succes d'etre aussi brillant qu'il eut pu l'etre;et tous les honneurs de la soiree demeurerent a Consuelo, qui fut encorerappelee et applaudie a la fin avec frenesie.Apres le spectacle on alla souper au palais Zustiniani, et Anzoletooublia la Corilla qu'il avait enfermee dans sa loge, et qui fut forceed'en sortir avec effraction. Dans le tumulte qui suit dans l'interieurdu theatre une representation aussi brillante, on ne s'apercut guere desa retraite. Mais le lendemain cette porte brisee vint coincider avec lecoup de griffe recu par Anzoleto, et c'est ainsi qu'on fut sur la voiede l'intrigue qu'il avait jusque la cachee si soigneusement.A peine etait-il assis au somptueux banquet que donnait le comte enl'honneur de Consuelo, et tandis que tous les abbes de la litteraturevenitienne debitaient a la triomphatrice les sonnets et madrigauximprovises de la veille, un valet glissa sous l'assiette d'Anzoleto unpetit billet de la Corilla, qu'il lut a la derobee, et qui etait ainsiconcu:"Si tu ne viens me trouver a l'instant meme, je vais te chercher etfaire un eclat, fusses-tu au bout du monde, fusses-tu dans les bras deta Consuelo, trois fois maudite."Anzoleto feignit d'etre pris d'une quinte de toux, et sortit pour ecrirecette reponse au crayon sur un bout de papier regle arrache dansl'antichambre a un cahier de musique:"Viens si tu veux; mon couteau est toujours pret, et avec lui mon mepriset ma haine."Le despote savait bien qu'avec une nature comme celle a qui il avaitaffaire, la peur etait le seul frein, la menace le seul expedient dumoment. Mais, malgre lui, il fut sombre et distrait durant la fete; etlorsqu'on se leva de table, il s'esquiva pour courir chez la Corilla.Il trouva cette malheureuse fille dans un etat digne de pitie. Auxconvulsions avaient succede des torrents de larmes; elle etait assise asa fenetre, echevelee, les yeux meurtris de sanglots; et sa robe,qu'elle avait dechiree de rage, tombait en lambeaux sur sa poitrinehaletante. Elle renvoya sa soeur et sa femme de chambre; et, malgreelle, un eclair de joie ranima ses traits en se trouvant aupres de celuiqu'elle avait craint de ne plus revoir. Mais Anzoleto la connaissaittrop pour chercher a la consoler. Il savait bien qu'au premiertemoignage de pitie ou de repentir, il verrait sa fureur se reveiller etabuser de la vengeance. Il prit le parti de perseverer dans son role dedurete inflexible; et bien qu'il fut touche de son desespoir, ill'accabla des plus cruels reproches, et lui declara qu'il venait luifaire d'eternels adieux. Il l'amena a se jeter a ses pieds, a se trainersur ses genoux jusqu'a la porte et a implorer son pardon dans l'angoissed'une mortelle douleur. Quand il l'eut ainsi brisee et aneantie, ilfeignit de se laisser attendrir; et tout eperdu d'orgueil et de je nesais quelle emotion fougueuse, en voyant cette femme si belle et sifiere se rouler devant lui dans la poussiere comme une Madeleinepenitente, il ceda a ses transports et la plongea dans de nouvellesivresses. Mais en se familiarisant avec cette lionne domptee, iln'oublia pas un instant que c'etait une bete feroce, et garda jusqu'aubout l'attitude d'un maitre offense qui pardonne.L'aube commencait a poindre lorsque cette femme, enivree et avilie,appuyant son bras de marbre sur le balcon humide du froid matinal etensevelissant sa face pale sous ses longs cheveux noirs, se mit a seplaindre d'une voix douce et caressante des tortures que son amour luifaisait eprouver."Eh bien, oui, lui dit-elle, je suis jalouse, et si tu le veuxabsolument, je suis pis que cela, je suis envieuse. Je ne puis voir magloire de dix annees eclipsee en un instant par une puissance nouvellequi s'eleve et devant laquelle une foule oublieuse et cruelle m'immolesans menagement et sans regret. Quand tu auras connu les transports dutriomphe et les humiliations de la decadence, tu ne seras plus siexigeant et si austere envers toi-meme que tu l'es aujourd'hui enversmoi. Je suis encore puissante, dis-tu; comblee de vanites, de succes, derichesses, et d'esperances superbes, je vais voir de nouvelles contrees,subjuguer de nouveaux amants, charmer un peuple nouveau. Quand tout celaserait vrai, crois-tu que quelque chose au monde puisse me consolerd'avoir ete abandonnee de tous mes amis, chassee de mon trone, et d'yvoir monter devant moi une autre idole? Et cette honte, la premiere dema vie, la seule dans toute ma carriere, elle m'est infligee sous tesyeux; que dis-je! elle m'est infligee par toi; elle est l'ouvrage de monamant, du premier homme que j'aie aime lachement, eperdument! Tu disencore que je suis fausse et mechante, que j'ai affecte devant toi unegrandeur hypocrite, une generosite menteuse; c'est toi qui l'as vouluainsi, Anzoleto. J'etais offensee, tu m'as prescrit de paraitretranquille, et je me suis tenue tranquille; j'etais mefiante, tu m'ascommande de te croire sincere, et j'ai cru en toi; j'avais la rage et lamort dans l'ame, tu m'as dit de sourire, et j'ai souri; j'etais furieuseet desesperee, tu m'as ordonne de garder le silence, et je me suis tue.Que pouvais-je faire de plus que de m'imposer un caractere qui n'etaitpas le mien, et de me parer d'un courage qui m'est impossible? Et quandce courage m'abandonne, quand ce supplice devient intolerable, quand jedeviens folle et que mes tortures devraient briser ton coeur, tu mefoules aux pieds, et tu veux m'abandonner mourante dans la fange ou tum'as plongee! Anzoleto, vous avez un coeur de bronze, et moi je suisaussi peu de chose que le sable des greves qui se laisse tourmenter etemporter par le flot rongeur. Ah! gronde-moi, frappe-moi, outrage-moi,puisque c'est le besoin de ta force; mais plains-moi du moins au fond deton ame; et a la mauvaise opinion que tu as de moi, juge de l'immensitede mon amour, puisque je souffre tout cela et demande a le souffrirencore."Mais ecoute, mon ami, lui dit-elle avec plus de douceur et enl'enlacant dans ses bras: ce que tu m'as fait souffrir n'est rien aupresde ce que j'eprouve en songeant a ton avenir et a ton propre bonheur. Tues perdu, Anzoleto, cher Anzoleto! perdu sans retour. Tu ne le sais pas,tu ne t'en doutes pas, et moi je le vois, et je me dis: "Si du moinsj'avais ete sacrifiee a son ambition si ma chute servait a edifier sontriomphe! Mais non! elle n'a servi qu'a sa perte, et je suisl'instrument d'une rivale qui met son pied sur nos deux tetes."--Que veux-tu dire, insensee? reprit Anzoleto; je ne te comprends pas.--Tu devrais me comprendre pourtant! tu devrais comprendre du moins cequi s'est passe ce soir. Tu n'as donc pas vu la froideur du publicsucceder a l'enthousiasme que ton premier air avait excite, apresqu'elle a eu chante, helas! comme elle chantera toujours, mieux que moi,mieux que tout le monde, et faut-il te le dire? mieux que toi, millefois, mon cher Anzoleto. Ah! tu ne vois pas que cette femme t'ecrasera,et que deja elle t'a ecrase en naissant? Tu ne vois pas que ta beauteest eclipsee par sa laideur; car elle est laide, je le soutiens; mais jesais aussi que les laides qui plaisent allument de plus furieusespassions et de plus violents engouements chez les hommes que les plusparfaites beautes de la terre. Tu ne vois pas qu'on l'idolatre et quepartout ou tu seras aupres d'elle, tu seras efface et passeras inapercu?Tu ne sais pas que pour se developper et pour prendre son essor, letalent du theatre a besoin de louanges et de succes, comme l'enfant quivient au monde a besoin d'air pour vivre et pour grandir; que la moindrerivalite absorbe une partie de la vie que l'artiste aspire, et qu'unerivalite redoutable, c'est le vide qui se fait autour de nous, c'est lamort qui penetre dans notre ame! Tu le vois bien par mon triste exemple:la seule apprehension de cette rivale que je ne connaissais pas, et quetu voulais m'empecher de craindre, a suffi pour me paralyser depuis unmois; et plus j'approchais du jour de son triomphe, plus ma voixs'eteignait, plus je me sentais deperir. Et je croyais a peine a cetriomphe possible! Que sera-ce donc maintenant que je l'ai vu certain,eclatant, inattaquable? Sais-tu bien que je ne peux plus reparaitre aVenise, et peut-etre en Italie sur aucun theatre, parce que je seraisdemoralisee, tremblante, frappee d'impuissance? Et qui sait ou cesouvenir ne m'atteindra pas, ou le nom et la presence de cette rivalevictorieuse ne viendront pas me poursuivre et me mettre en fuite? Ah!moi, je suis perdue; mais tu l'es aussi, Anzoleto. Tu es mort avantd'avoir vecu; et si j'etais aussi mechante que tu le dis, je m'enrejouirais, je te pousserais a ta perte, et je serais vengee; au lieuque je te le dis avec desespoir: si tu reparais une seule fois aupresd'elle a Venise, tu n'as plus d'avenir a Venise; si tu la suis dans sesvoyages, la honte et le neant voyageront avec toi. Si, vivant de sesrecettes, partageant son opulence, et t'abritant sous sa renommee, tutraines a ses cotes une existence pale et miserable, sais-tu quel seraton titre aupres du public? Quel est, dira-t-on en te voyant, ce beaujeune homme qu'on apercoit derriere elle? Rien, repondra-t-on; moins querien: c'est le mari ou l'amant de la divine cantatrice."Anzoleto devint sombre comme les nuees orageuses qui montaient al'orient du ciel."Tu es une folle, chere Corilla, repondit-il; la Consuelo n'est pasaussi redoutable pour toi que tu te l'es representee aujourd'hui danston imagination malade. Quant a moi, je te l'ai dit, je ne suis pas sonamant, je ne serai surement jamais son mari, et je ne vivrai pas commeun oiseau chetif sous l'ombre de ses larges ailes. Laisse-la prendre sonvol. Il y a dans le ciel de l'air et de l'espace pour tous ceux qu'unessor puissant enleve de terre. Tiens, regarde ce passereau; nevole-t-il pas aussi bien sur le canal que le plus lourd goeland sur lamer? Allons! treve a ces reveries! le jour me chasse de tes bras. Ademain. Si tu veux que je revienne, reprends cette douceur et cettepatience qui m'avaient charme, et qui vont mieux a ta beaute que lescris et les emportements de la jalousie."Anzoleto, absorbe pourtant dans de noires pensees, se retira chez lui,et ce ne fut que couche et pret a s'endormir, qu'il se demanda qui avaitdu accompagner Consuelo au sortir du palais Zustiniani pour la ramenerchez elle. C'etait un soin qu'il n'avait jamais laisse prendre apersonne."Apres tout, se dit-il en donnant de grands coups de poing a sonoreiller pour l'arranger sous sa tete, si la destinee veut que le comteen vienne a ses fins, autant vaut pour moi que cela arrive plus tot queplus tard!"XVIII.Lorsque Anzoleto s'eveilla, il sentit se reveiller aussi la jalousie quelui avait inspiree le comte Zustiniani. Mille sentiments contraires separtageaient son ame. D'abord cette autre jalousie que la Corilla avaiteveillee en lui pour le genie et le succes de Consuelo. Celle-las'enfoncait plus avant dans son sein, a mesure qu'il comparait letriomphe de sa fiancee a ce que, dans son ambition trompee, il appelaitsa propre chute. Ensuite l'humiliation d'etre supplante peut-etre dansla realite, comme il l'etait deja dans l'opinion, aupres de cette femmedesormais celebre et toute-puissante dont il etait si flatte la veilled'etre l'unique et souverain amour. Ces deux jalousies se disputaientdans sa pensee, et il ne savait a laquelle se livrer pour eteindrel'autre. Il avait a choisir entre deux partis: ou d'eloigner Consuelo ducomte et de Venise, et de chercher avec elle fortune ailleurs, ou del'abandonner a son rival, et d'aller au loin tenter seul les chancesd'un succes qu'elle ne viendrait plus contre-balancer. Dans cetteincertitude de plus en plus poignante, au lieu d'aller reprendre ducalme aupres de sa veritable amie, il se lanca de nouveau dans l'orageen retournant chez la Corilla. Elle attisa le feu en lui demontrant,avec plus de force que la veille, tout le desavantage de sa position."Nul n'est prophete en son pays, lui dit-elle; et c'est deja un mauvaismilieu pour toi que la ville ou tu es ne, ou l'on t'a vu courir enhaillons sur la place publique, ou chacun peut se dire (et Dieu sait queles nobles aiment a se vanter de leurs bienfaits, meme imaginaires,envers les artistes): "C'est moi qui l'ai protege; je me suis apercu lepremier de son talent; c'est moi qui l'ai recommande a celui-ci, c'estmoi qui l'ai prefere a celui-la." Tu as beaucoup trop vecu ici au grandair, mon pauvre Anzolo; ta charmante figure avait frappe tous lespassants avant qu'on sut qu'il y avait en toi de l'avenir. Le moyend'eblouir des gens qui t'ont vu ramer sur leur gondole, pour gagnerquelques sous, en leur chantant les strophes du Tasse, ou faire leurscommissions pour avoir de quoi souper! Consuelo, laide et menant une vieretiree, est ici une merveille etrangere. Elle est Espagnole d'ailleurs,elle n'a pas l'accent venitien. Sa prononciation belle, quoiqu'un peusinguliere, leur plairait encore, quand meme elle serait detestable:c'est quelque chose dont leurs oreilles ne sont pas rebattues. Ta beautea ete pour les trois quarts dans le petit succes que tu as eu au premieracte. Au dernier on y etait deja habitue.--Dites aussi que la belle cicatrice que vous m'avez faite au-dessous del'oeil, et que je ne devrais vous pardonner de ma vie, n'a pas peucontribue a m'enlever ce dernier, ce frivole avantage.--Serieux au contraire aux yeux des femmes, mais frivole a ceux deshommes. Avec les unes, tu regneras dans les salons; sans les autres, tusuccomberas au theatre. Et comment veux-tu les occuper, quand c'est unefemme qui te les dispute? une femme qui subjugue non-seulement lesdilettanti serieux, mais qui enivre encore, par sa grace et le prestigede son sexe, tous les hommes qui ne sont point connaisseurs en musique!Ah! que pour lutter avec moi, il a fallu de talent et de science aStefanini, a Saverio, et a tous ceux qui ont paru avec moi sur la scene!--A ce compte, chere Corilla, je courrais autant de risques en memontrant aupres de toi, que j'en cours aupres de la Consuelo. Si j'avaiseu la fantaisie de te suivre en France, tu me donnerais la un bonavertissement."Ces mots echappes a Anzoleto furent un trait de lumiere pour la Corilla.Elle vit qu'elle avait frappe plus juste qu'elle ne s'en flattaitencore; car la pensee de quitter Venise s'etait deja formulee dansl'esprit de son amant. Des qu'elle concut l'espoir de l'entrainer avecelle, elle n'epargna rien pour lui faire gouter ce projet. Elles'abaissa elle-meme tant qu'elle put, et elle se mit au-dessous de sarivale avec une modestie sans bornes. Elle se resigna meme a direqu'elle n'etait ni assez grande cantatrice, ni assez belle pour allumerdes passions dans le public. Et comme tout cela etait plus vrai qu'ellene le pensait en le disant, comme Anzoleto s'en apercevait de reste, etne s'etait jamais abuse sur l'immense superiorite de Consuelo, ellen'eut pas de peine a le lui persuader. Leur association et leur fuitefurent donc a peu pres resolues dans cette seance; et Anzoleto ysongeait serieusement, bien qu'il se gardat toujours une porte dederriere pour echapper a cet engagement dans l'occasion.Corilla, voyant qu'il lui restait un fond d'incertitude, l'engageafortement a continuer ses debuts, le flattant de l'esperance d'unmeilleur sort pour les autres representations; mais bien certaine, aufond, que ces epreuves malheureuses le degouteraient completement et deVenise et de Consuelo.En sortant de chez sa maitresse, il se rendit chez son amie. Uninvincible besoin de la revoir l'y poussait imperieusement. C'etait lapremiere fois qu'il avait fini et commence une journee sans recevoir sonchaste baiser au front. Mais comme, apres ce qui venait de se passeravec la Corilla, il eut rougi de sa versatilite, il essaya de sepersuader qu'il allait chercher aupres d'elle la certitude de soninfidelite, et le desabusement complet de son amour. Sans nul doute, sedisait-il, le comte aura profite de l'occasion et du depit cause par monabsence, et il est impossible qu'un libertin tel que lui se soit trouveavec elle la nuit en tete-a-tete, sans que la pauvrette ait succombe.Cette idee lui faisait pourtant venir une sueur froide au visage; s'ils'y arretait, la certitude du remords et du desespoir de Consuelobrisait son ame, et il hatait le pas, s'imaginant la trouver, noyee delarmes. Et puis une voix interieure, plus forte que toutes les autres,lui disait qu'une chute aussi prompte et aussi honteuse etait impossiblea un etre aussi pur et aussi noble; et il ralentissait sa marche ensongeant a lui-meme, a l'odieux de sa conduite, a l'egoisme de sonambition, aux mensonges et aux reproches dont il avait rempli sa vie etsa conscience.Il trouva Consuelo dans sa robe noire, devant sa table, aussi sereine etaussi sainte dans son attitude et dans son regard qu'il l'avait toujoursvue. Elle courut a lui avec la meme effusion qu'a l'ordinaire, etl'interrogea avec inquietude, mais sans reproche et sans mefiance, surl'emploi de ce temps passe loin d'elle."J'ai ete souffrant, lui repondit-il avec l'abattement profond que luicausait son humiliation interieure. Ce coup que je me suis donne a latete contre un decor, et dont je t'ai montre la marque en te disant quece n'etait rien, m'a pourtant cause un si fort ebranlement au cerveauqu'il m'a fallu quitter le palais Zustiniani dans la crainte de m'yevanouir, et que j'ai eu besoin de garder le lit toute la matinee.--O mon Dieu! dit Consuelo en baisant la cicatrice faite par sa rivale;tu as souffert, et tu souffres encore?--Non, ce repos m'a fait du bien. N'y songe plus, et dis-moi comment tuas fait pour revenir toute seule cette nuit?--Toute seule? Oh! non, le comte m'a ramenee dans sa gondole.--Ah! j'en etais sur! s'ecria Anzoleto avec un accent etrange. Et sansdoute ... il t'a dit de bien belles choses dans ce tete-a-tete?--Qu'eut-il pu me dire qu'il ne m'ait dit cent fois devant tout lemonde? Il me gate, et me donnerait de la vanite si je n'etais en gardecontre cette maladie. D'ailleurs, nous n'etions pas tete-a-tete; mon bonmaitre a voulu m'accompagner aussi. Oh! l'excellent ami!--Quel maitre? que excellent ami? dit Anzoleto rassure et dejapreoccupe.--Eh! le Porpora! A quoi songes-tu donc?--Je songe, chere Consuelo, a ton triomphe d'hier soir; et toi, ysonges-tu?--Moins qu'au tien, je te jure!--Le mien! Ah! ne me raille pas, ma belle amie; le mien a ete si palequ'il ressemblait beaucoup a une chute."Consuelo palit de surprise. Elle n'avait pas eu, malgre sa fermeteremarquable, tout le sang-froid necessaire pour apprecier la differencedes applaudissements qu'elle et son amant avaient recueillis. II y adans ces sortes d'ovations un trouble auquel l'artiste le plus sage nepeut se derober, et qui fait souvent illusion a quelques-uns, au pointde leur faire prendre l'appui d'une cabale pour la clameur d'un succes.Mais au lieu de s'exagerer l'amour de son public, Consuelo, presqueeffrayee d'un bruit si terrible, avait eu peine a le comprendre, etn'avait pas constate la preference qu'on lui avait donnee sur Anzoleto.Elle le gronda naivement de son exigence envers la fortune; et voyantqu'elle ne pouvait ni le persuader ni vaincre sa tristesse, elle luireprocha doucement d'etre trop amoureux de la gloire, et d'attacher tropde prix a la faveur du monde."Je te l'ai toujours predit, lui dit-elle, tu preferes les resultats del'art a l'art lui-meme. Quand on a fait de son mieux, quand on sentqu'on a fait bien, il me semble qu'un peu plus ou un peu moinsd'approbation n'ote ni n'ajoute rien au contentement interieur.Souviens-toi de ce que me disait le Porpora la premiere fois que j'aichante au palais Zustiniani: Quiconque se sent penetre d'un amour vraipour son art ne peut rien craindre ...--Ton Porpora et toi, interrompit Anzoleto avec humeur, pouvez bien vousnourrir de ces belles maximes. Rien n'est si aise que de philosopher surles maux de la vie quand on n'en connait que les biens. Le Porpora,quoique pauvre et conteste, a un nom illustre. Il a cueilli assez delauriers pour que sa vieille tete puisse blanchir en paix sous leurombre. Toi qui te sens invincible, tu es inaccessible a la peur. Tut'eleves du premier bond au sommet de l'echelle, et tu reproches a ceuxqui n'ont pas de jambes d'avoir le vertige. C'est peu charitable,Consuelo, et souverainement injuste. Et puis ton argument ne m'est pasapplicable: tu dis que l'on doit mepriser l'assentiment du public quandon a le sien propre; mais si je ne l'ai pas, ce temoignage interieurd'avoir bien fait? Et ne vois-tu pas que je suis horriblement mecontentde moi-meme? N'as-tu pas vu que j'etais detestable? N'as-tu pas entenduque j'ai chante pitoyablement?--Non, car cela n'est pas. Tu n'as ete ni au-dessus ni au-dessous detoi-meme. L'emotion que tu eprouvais n'a presque rien ote a tes moyens.Elle s'est vite dissipee d'ailleurs, et les choses que tu sais bien, tules a bien rendues.--Et celles que je ne sais pas?" dit Anzoleto en fixant sur elle sesgrands yeux noirs creuses par la fatigue et le chagrin.Elle soupira et garda un instant le silence, puis elle lui dit enl'embrassant:"Celles que tu ne sais pas, il faut les apprendre. Si tu avais vouluetudier serieusement pendant les repetitions ... Te l'ai-je dit? Mais cen'est pas le moment de faire des reproches, c'est le moment au contrairede tout reparer. Voyons, prenons seulement deux heures par jour, et tuverras que nous triompherons vite de ce qui t'arrete.--Sera-ce donc l'affaire d'un jour?--Ce sera l'affaire de quelques mois tout au plus.--Et cependant je joue demain! je continue a debuter devant un publicqui me juge sur mes defauts beaucoup plus que sur mes qualites.--Mais qui s'apercevra bien de tes progres.--Qui sait? S'il me prend en aversion!--Il t'a prouve le contraire.--Oui! tu trouves qu'il a ete indulgent pour moi?--Eh bien, oui, il l'a ete, mon ami. La ou tu as ete faible, il a etebienveillant; la ou tu as ete fort, il t'a rendu justice.--Mais, en attendant, on va me faire en consequence un engagementmiserable.--Le comte est magnifique en tout et n'epargne pas l'argent. D'ailleursne m'en offre-t-il pas plus qu'il ne nous en faut pour vivre tous deuxdans l'opulence?--C'est cela! je vivrais de ton succes!--J'ai bien assez longtemps vecu de ta faveur.--Ce n'est pas de l'argent qu'il s'agit. Qu'il m'engage a peu de frais,peu importe; mais il m'engagera pour les seconds ou les troisiemesroles.--Il n'a pas d'autre _primo-uomo_ sous la main. Il y a longtemps qu'ilcompte sur toi et ne songe qu'a toi. D'ailleurs il est tout porte pourtoi. Tu disais qu'il serait contraire a notre mariage! Loin de la, ilsemble le desirer, et me demande souvent quand je l'inviterai a ma noce.--Ah! vraiment? C'est fort bien! Grand merci, monsieur le comte!--Que veux-tu dire?--Rien. Seulement, Consuelo, tu as eu grand tort de ne pas m'empecher dedebuter jusqu'a ce que mes defauts que tu connaissais si bien, sefussent corriges dans de meilleures etudes. Car tu les connais, mesdefauts, je le repete.--Ai-je manque de franchise? ne t'ai-je pas averti souvent? Mais tu m'astoujours dit que le public ne s'y connaissait pas; et quand j'ai su quelsucces tu avais remporte chez le comte la premiere fois que tu as chantedans son salon, j'ai pense que ...--Que les gens du monde ne s'y connaissaient pas plus que le publicvulgaire?--J'ai pense que tes qualites frapperaient plus que tes defauts; et ilen a ete ainsi, ce me semble, pour les uns comme pour l'autre.--Au fait, pensa Anzoleto, elle dit vrai, et si je pouvais reculer mesdebuts.... Mais c'est courir le risque de voir appeler a ma place untenor qui ne me la cederait plus. Voyons! dit-il apres avoir faitplusieurs tours dans la chambre, quels sont donc mes defauts?--Ceux que je t'ai dits souvent, trop de hardiesse et pas assez depreparation; une energie plus fievreuse que sentie; des effetsdramatiques qui sont l'ouvrage de la volonte plus que ceux del'attendrissement. Tu ne t'es pas penetre de l'ensemble de ton role. Tul'as appris par fragments. Tu n'y as vu qu'une succession de morceauxplus ou moins brillants. Tu n'en as saisi ni la gradation, ni ledeveloppement, ni le resume. Presse de montrer ta belle voix etl'habilete que tu as a certains egards, tu as donne ton dernier motpresque en entrant en scene. A la moindre occasion, tu as cherche uneffet, et tous tes effets ont ete semblables. A la fin du premier acte,on te connaissait, on te savait par coeur; mais on ne savait pas quec'etait tout, et on attendait quelque chose de prodigieux pour la fin.Ce quelque chose n'etait pas en toi. Ton emotion etait epuisee, et tavoix n'avait plus la meme fraicheur. Tu l'as senti, tu as force l'une etl'autre; on l'a senti aussi, et l'on est reste froid, a ta grandesurprise, au moment ou tu te croyais le plus pathetique. C'est qu'a cemoment-la on ne voyait pas l'artiste inspire par la passion, maisl'acteur aux prises avec le succes.--Et comment donc font les autres? s'ecria Anzoleto en frappant du pied.Est-ce que je ne les ai pas entendus, tous ceux qu'on a applaudis aVenise depuis dix ans? Est-ce que le vieux Stefanini ne criait pas quandla voix lui manquait? Et cependant on l'applaudissait avec rage.--II est vrai, et je n'ai pas compris que le public put s'y tromper.Sans doute on se souvenait du temps ou il y avait eu en lui plus depuissance, et on ne voulait pas lui faire sentir le malheur de son age.--Et la Corilla, voyons, cette idole que tu renverses, est-ce qu'elle neforcait pas les situations? Est-ce-qu'elle ne faisait pas des effortspenibles a voir et a entendre? Est-ce qu'elle etait passionnee tout debon, quand on la portait aux nues?--C'est parce que j'ai trouve ses moyens factices, ses effetsdetestables, son jeu comme son chant depourvus de gout et de grandeur,que je me suis presentee si tranquillement sur la scene, persuadee commetoi que le public ne s'y connaissait pas beaucoup.--Ah! dit Anzoleto avec un profond soupir, tu mets le doigt sur maplaie, pauvre Consuelo!--Comment cela, mon bien-aime?--Comment cela? tu me le demandes? Nous nous etions trompes, Consuelo.Le public s'y connait. Son coeur lui apprend ce que son ignorance luivoile. C'est un grand enfant qui a besoin d'amusement et d'emotion. Ilse contente de ce qu'on lui donne; mais qu'on lui montre quelque chosede mieux, et le voila qui compare et qui comprend. La Corilla pouvaitencore le charmer la semaine derniere, bien qu'elle chantat faux etmanquat de respiration. Tu parais, et la Corilla est perdue; elle esteffacee, enterree. Qu'elle reparaisse, on la sifflera. Si j'avais debuteaupres d'elle, j'aurais eu un succes complet comme celui que j'ai euchez le comte, la premiere fois que j'ai chante apres elle. Mais aupresde toi, j'ai ete eclipse. Il en devait etre ainsi, et il en seratoujours ainsi. Le public avait le gout du clinquant. Il prenait desoripeaux pour des pierreries; il en etait ebloui. On lui montre undiamant fin, et deja il ne comprend plus qu'on ait pu le tromper sigrossierement. Il ne peut plus souffrir les diamants faux, et il en faitjustice. Voila mon malheur, Consuelo: c'est d'avoir ete produit, moi,verroterie de Venise, a cote d'une perle sortie du fond des mers."Consuelo ne comprit pas tout ce qu'il y avait d'amertume et de veritedans ces reflexions. Elle les mit sur le compte de l'amour de sonfiance, et ne repondit a ce qu'elle prit pour de douces flatteries, quepar des sourires et des caresses. Elle pretendit qu'il la surpasserait,le jour ou il voudrait s'en donner la peine, et releva son courage enlui persuadant que rien n'etait plus facile que de chanter comme elle.Elle etait de bonne foi en ceci, n'ayant jamais ete arretee par aucunedifficulte, et ne sachant pas que le travail meme est le premier desobstacles, pour quiconque n'en a pas l'amour et la perseverance.XIX.Encourage par la franchise de Consuelo et la perfidie de Corilla qui lepressait de se faire entendre encore en public, Anzoleto se mit atravailler avec ardeur; et a la seconde representation d'_Ipermnestre_,il chanta beaucoup plus purement son premier acte. On lui en sut gre.Mais, comme le succes de Consuelo grandit en proportion, il ne fut passatisfait du sien, et commenca a se sentir demoralise par cette nouvelleconstatation de son inferiorite. Des ce moment, tout prit a ses yeux unaspect sinistre. Il lui sembla qu'on ne l'ecoutait pas, que lesspectateurs places pres de lui murmuraient des reflexions humiliantessur son compte, et que les amateurs bienveillants qui l'encourageaientdans les coulisses avaient l'air de le plaindre profondement. Tous leurseloges eurent pour lui un double sens dont il s'appliqua le plusmauvais. La Corilla, qu'il alla consulter dans sa loge durantl'entr'acte, affecta de lui demander d'un air effraye s'il n'etait pasmalade.--Pourquoi? lui dit-il avec impatience."Parce que ta voix est sourde aujourd'hui, et que tu sembles accable!Cher Anzoleto, reprends courage; donne tes moyens qui sont paralyses parla crainte ou le decouragement.--N'ai-je pas bien dit mon premier air?--Pas a beaucoup pres aussi bien que la premiere fois. J'en ai eu lecoeur si serre que j'ai failli me trouver mal.--Mais on m'a applaudi, pourtant?--Helas!... n'importe: j'ai tort de t'oter l'illusion. Continue ...Seulement tache de derouiller ta voix.""Consuelo, pensa-t-il, a cru me donner un conseil. Elle agit d'instinct,et reussit pour son propre compte. Mais ou aurait-elle pris l'experiencede m'enseigner a dominer ce public recalcitrant? En suivant la directionqu'elle me donne, je perds mes avantages, et on ne me tient pas comptede l'amelioration de ma maniere. Voyons! revenons a mon audace premiere.N'ai-je pas eprouve, a mon debut chez le comte, que je pouvais eblouirmeme ceux que je ne persuadais pas? Le vieux Porpora ne m'a-t-il pas ditque j'avais les taches du genie? Allons donc! que ce public subisse mestaches et qu'il plie sous mon genie."Il se battit les flancs, fit des prodiges au second acte, et fut ecouteavec surprise. Quelques-uns battirent des mains, d'autres imposerentsilence aux applaudissements. Le public en masse se demanda si celaetait sublime ou detestable.Encore un peu d'audace, et peut-etre qu'Anzoleto l'emportait. Mais cetechec le troubla au point que sa tete s'egara, et qu'il manquahonteusement tout le reste de son role.A la troisieme representation, il avait repris son courage, et, resolud'aller a sa guise sans ecouter les conseils de Consuelo; il hasarda lesplus etranges caprices, les bizarreries les plus impertinentes, honte!deux ou trois sifflets interrompirent le silence qui accueillait cestentatives desesperees. Le bon et genereux public fit taire les siffletset se mit a battre des mains; il n'y avait pas moyen de s'abuser surcette bienveillance envers la personne et sur ce blame envers l'artiste.Anzoleto dechira son costume en rentrant dans sa loge, et, a peine lapiece finie, il courut s'enfermer avec la Corilla, en proie a une rageprofonde et determine a fuir avec elle au bout de la terre.Trois jours s'ecoulerent sans qu'il revit Consuelo. Elle lui inspiraitnon pas de la haine, non pas du refroidissement (au fond de son amebourrelee de remords, il la cherissait toujours et souffraitmortellement de ne pas la voir), mais une veritable terreur. Il sentaitla domination de cet etre qui l'ecrasait en public de toute sa grandeur,et qui en secret reprenait a son gre possession de sa confiance et de savolonte. Dans son agitation il n'eut pas la force de cacher a la Corillacombien il etait attache a sa noble fiancee, et combien elle avaitencore d'empire sur ses convictions. La Corilla en concut un depit amer,qu'elle eut la force de dissimuler. Elle le plaignit, le confessa; etquand elle sut le secret de sa jalousie, elle frappa un grand coup enfaisant savoir sous main a Zustiniani sa propre intimite avec Anzoleto,pensant bien que le comte ne perdrait pas une si belle occasion d'eninstruire l'objet de ses desirs, et de rendre a Anzoleto le retourimpossible.Surprise de voir un jour entier s'ecouler dans la solitude de samansarde, Consuelo s'inquieta; et le lendemain d'un nouveau jourd'attente vaine et d'angoisse mortelle, a la nuit tombante, elles'enveloppa d'une mante epaisse (car la cantatrice celebre n'etait plusgarantie par son obscurite contre les mechants propos), et courut a lamaison qu'occupait Anzoleto depuis quelques semaines, logement plusconvenable que les precedents, et que le comte lui avait assigne dansune des nombreuses maisons qu'il possedait dans la ville. Elle ne l'ytrouva point, et apprit qu'il y passait rarement la nuit.Cette circonstance ne l'eclaira pas sur son infidelite. Elle connaissaitses habitudes de vagabondage poetique, et pensa que, ne pouvants'habituer a ces somptueuses demeures, il retournait a quelqu'un de sesanciens gites. Elle allait se hasarder a l'y chercher, lorsqu'en seretournant pour repasser la porte, elle se trouva face a face avecmaitre Porpora."Consuelo, lui dit-il a voix basse, il est inutile de me cacher testraits; je viens d'entendre ta voix, et ne puis m'y meprendre. Queviens-tu faire ici, a cette heure, ma pauvre enfant, et que cherches-tudans cette maison?--J'y cherche mon fiance, repondit Consuelo en s'attachant au bras deson vieux maitre. Et je ne sais pas pourquoi je rougirais de l'avouer amon meilleur ami. Je sais bien que vous blamez mon attachement pour lui;mais je ne saurais vous faire un mensonge. Je suis inquiete. Je n'ai pasvu Anzoleto depuis avant-hier au theatre. Je le crois malade.--Malade? lui! dit le professeur en haussant les epaules. Viens avecmoi, pauvre fille; il faut que nous causions; et puisque tu prends enfinle parti de m'ouvrir ton coeur, il faut que je t'ouvre le mien aussi.Donne-moi le bras, mous parlerons en marchant. Ecoute, Consuelo; etpenetre-toi bien de ce que je vais te dire. Tu ne peux pas, tu ne doispas etre la femme de ce jeune homme. Je te le defends, au nom du Dieuvivant qui m'a donne pour toi des entrailles de pere.--O mon maitre, repondit-elle avec douleur, demandez-moi le sacrifice dema vie, mais non celui de mon amour.--Je ne le demande pas, je l'exige, repondit le Porpora avec fermete.Cet amant est maudit. Il fera ton tourment et ta honte si tu nel'abjures a l'instant meme.--Cher maitre, reprit-elle avec un sourire triste et caressant, vousm'avez dit cela bien souvent; mais j'ai vainement essaye de vous obeir.Vous haissez ce pauvre enfant. Vous ne le connaissez pas, et je suiscertaine que vous reviendrez de vos preventions.--Consuelo, dit le maestro avec plus de force, je t'ai fait jusqu'icid'assez vaines objections et de tres-inutiles defenses, je le sais. Jet'ai parle en artiste, et comme a une artiste; je ne voyais non plusdans ton fiance que l'artiste. Aujourd'hui, je te parle en homme, et jete parle d'un homme, et je te parle comme a une femme. Cette femme a malplace son amour, cet homme en est indigne, et l'homme qui te le dit enest certain.--O mon Dieu! Anzoleto indigne de mon amour! Lui, mon seul ami, monprotecteur, mon frere! Ah! vous ne savez pas comme il m'a aidee et commeil m'a respectee depuis que je suis au monde! Il faut que je vous ledise."Et Consuelo raconta toute l'histoire de sa vie et de son amour, quietait une seule et meme histoire.Le Porpora en fut emu, mais non ebranle."Dans tout ceci, dit-il, je ne vois que ton innocence, ta fidelite, tavertu. Quant a lui, je vois bien le besoin qu'il a eu de ta societe etde tes enseignements, auxquels, bien que tu en penses, je sais qu'ildoit le peu qu'il sait et le peu qu'il vaut; mais il n'en est pas moinsvrai que cet amant si chaste et si pur n'est que le rebut de toutes lesfemmes perdues de Venise, qu'il apaise l'ardeur des feux que tu luiinspires dans les maisons de debauche, et qu'il ne songe qu'at'exploiter, tandis qu'il assouvit ailleurs ses honteuses passions.--Prenez garde a ce que vous dites, repondit Consuelo d'une voixetouffee; j'ai coutume de croire en vous comme en Dieu, o mon maitre!Mais en ce qui concerne Anzoleto, j'ai resolu de vous fermer mesoreilles et mon coeur ... Ah! laissez-moi vous quitter, ajouta-t-elle enessayant de detacher son bras de celui du professeur, vous me donnez lamort.--Je veux donner la mort a ta passion funeste, et par la verite je veuxte rendre a la vie, repondit-il en serrant le bras de l'enfant contre sapoitrine genereuse et indignee. Je sais que je suis rude, Consuelo. Jene sais pas etre autrement, et c'est a cause de cela que j'ai retarde,tant que je l'ai pu, le coup que je vais te porter. J'ai espere que tuouvrirais les yeux, que tu comprendrais ce qui se passe autour de toi.Mais au lieu de t'eclairer par l'experience, tu te lances en aveugle aumilieu des abimes. Je ne veux pas t'y laisser tomber! moi! Tu es le seuletre que j'aie estime depuis dix ans. Il ne faut pas que tu perisses,non, il ne le faut pas.--Mais, mon ami, je ne suis pas en danger. Croyez-vous que je mentequand je vous jure, par tout ce qu'il y a de sacre, que j'ai respecte leserment fait au lit de mort de ma mere? Anzoleto le respecte aussi. Jene suis pas encore sa femme, je ne suis donc pas sa maitresse.--Mais qu'il dise un mot, et tu seras l'une et l'autre!--Ma mere elle-meme nous l'a fait promettre.--Et tu venais cependant ce soir trouver cet homme qui ne veut pas etqui ne peut pas etre ton mari?--Qui vous l'a dit?--La Corilla lui permettrait-elle jamais de ...--La Corilla? Qu'y a-t-il de commun entre lui et la Corilla?--Nous sommes a deux pas de la demeure de cette fille ... Tu cherchaiston fiance ... allons l'y trouver. T'en sens-tu le courage?--Non! non! mille fois non! repondit Consuelo en flechissant dans samarche et en s'appuyant contre la muraille. Laissez-moi la vie, monmaitre; ne me tuez pas avant que j'aie vecu. Je vous dis que vous mefaites mourir.--Il faut que tu boives ce calice, reprit l'inexorable vieillard; jefais ici le role du destin. N'ayant jamais fait que des ingrats et parconsequent des malheureux par ma tendresse et ma mansuetude, il faut queje dise la verite a ceux que j'aime. C'est le seul bien que puisseoperer un coeur desseche par le malheur et petrifie par la souffrance.Je te plains, ma pauvre fille, de n'avoir pas un ami plus doux et plushumain pour te soutenir dans cette crise fatale. Mais tel que l'on m'afait, il faut que j'agisse sur les autres et que j'eclaire par lerayonnement de la foudre, ne pouvant vivifier par la chaleur du soleil.Ainsi donc, Consuelo, pas de faiblesse entre nous. Viens a ce palais. Jeveux que tu surprennes ton amant dans les bras de l'impure Corilla. Situ ne peux marcher, je te trainerai! Si tu tombes je te porterai! Ah! Levieux Porpora est robuste encore, quand le feu de la colere divine bruledans ses entrailles!--Grace! grace! s'ecria Consuelo plus pale que la mort. Laissez-moidouter encore ... Donnez-moi encore un jour, un seul jour pour croire enlui; je ne suis pas preparee a ce supplice ...--Non, pas un jour, pas une heure, repondit-il d'un ton inflexible; carcette heure qui s'ecoule, je ne la retrouverai pas pour te mettre laverite sous les yeux; et ce jour que tu demandes, l'infame enprofiterait pour te remettre sous le joug du mensonge. Tu viendras avecmoi; je te l'ordonne, je le veux.--Eh bien, oui! j'irai, dit Consuelo en reprenant sa force par uneviolente reaction de l'amour. J'irai avec vous pour constater votreinjustice et la foi de mon amant; car vous vous trompez indignement, etvous voulez que je me trompe avec vous! Allez donc, bourreau que vousetes! Je vous suis, et je ne vous crains pas."Le Porpora la prit au mot; et, saisissant son bras dans sa mainnerveuse, forte comme une pince de fer, il la conduisit dans la maisonqu'il habitait, ou, apres lui avoir fait parcourir tous les corridors etmonter tous les escaliers, il lui fit atteindre une terrasse superieure,d'ou l'on distinguait, au-dessus d'une maison plus basse, completementinhabitee, le palais de la Corilla, sombre du bas en haut, a l'exceptiond'une seule fenetre qui etait eclairee et ouverte sur la facade noire etsilencieuse de la maison deserte. Il semblait, de cette fenetre, qu'onne put etre apercu de nulle part; car un balcon avance empechait qued'en bas on put rien distinguer. De niveau, il n'y avait rien, etau-dessus seulement les combles de la maison qu'habitait le Porpora, etqui n'etait pas tournee de facon a pouvoir plonger dans le palais de lacantatrice. Mais la Corilla ignorait qu'a l'angle de ces combles il yavait un rebord festonne de plomb, une sorte de niche en plein air, ou,derriere un large tuyau de cheminee, le maestro, par un capriced'artiste, venait chaque soir regarder les etoiles, fuir ses semblables,et rever a ses sujets sacres ou dramatiques. Le hasard lui avait faitainsi decouvrir le mystere des amours d'Anzoleto, et Consuelo n'eut qu'aregarder dans la direction qu'il lui donnait, pour voir son amant aupresde sa rivale dans un voluptueux tete-a-tete. Elle se detourna aussitot;et le Porpora qui, dans la crainte de quelque vertige de desespoir, latenait avec une force surhumaine, la ramena a l'etage inferieur et lafit entrer dans son cabinet, dont il ferma la porte et la fenetre pourensevelir dans le mystere l'explosion qu'il prevoyait.XX.Mais il n'y eut point d'explosion. Consuelo resta muette et atterree. LePorpora lui adressa la parole. Elle ne repondit pas, et lui fit signe dene pas l'interroger; puis elle se leva, alla boire, a grands verres,toute une carafe d'eau glacee qui etait sur le clavecin, fit quelquestours dans la chambre, et revint s'asseoir en face de son maitre sansdire une parole.Le vieillard austere ne comprit pas la profondeur de sa souffrance."Eh bien, lui dit-il, t'avais-je trompee? Que penses-tu fairemaintenant?"Un frisson douloureux ebranla la statue; et apres avoir passe la mainsur son front: "Je pense ne rien faire, dit-elle, avant d'avoir comprisce qui m'arrive.--Et que te reste-t-il a comprendre?--Tout! car je ne comprends rien; et vous me voyez occupee a chercher lacause de mon malheur, sans rien trouver qui me l'explique. Quel malai-je fait a Anzoleto pour qu'il ne m'aime plus? Quelle faute ai-jecommise qui m'ait rendue meprisable a ses yeux? Vous ne pouvez pas me ledire, vous! puisque moi qui lis dans ma propre conscience, je n'y voisrien qui me donne la clef de ce mystere. Oh! c'est un prodigeinconcevable! Ma mere croyait a la puissance des philtres: cette Corillaserait-elle une magicienne?--Pauvre enfant! dit le maestro; il y a bien ici une magicienne, maiselle s'appelle Vanite; il y a bien un poison, mais il s'appelle Envie.La Corilla a pu le verser; mais ce n'est pas elle qui a petri cette amesi propre a le recevoir. Le venin coulait deja dans les veines impuresd'Anzoleto. Une dose de plus l'a rendu traitre, de fourbe qu'il etait;infidele, d'ingrat qu'il a toujours ete.--Quelle vanite? quelle envie?--La vanite de surpasser tous les autres, l'envie de te surpasser, larage d'etre surpasse par toi.--Cela est-il croyable? Un homme peut-il etre jaloux des avantages d'unefemme? Un amant peut-il hair le succes de son amante? Il y a donc biendes choses que je ne sais pas, et que je ne puis pas comprendre!--Tu ne les comprendras jamais; mais tu les constateras a toute heure deta vie. Tu sauras qu'un homme peut etre jaloux des avantages d'unefemme, quand cet homme est un artiste vaniteux; et qu'un amant peut hairles succes de son amante, quand le theatre est le milieu ou ils vivent.C'est qu'un comedien n'est pas un homme, Consuelo; c'est une femme. Ilne vit que de vanite maladive; il ne songe qu'a satisfaire sa vanite; ilne travaille que pour s'enivrer de vanite. La beaute d'une femme luifait du tort. Le talent d'une femme efface ou conteste le sien. Unefemme est son rival, ou plutot il est la rivale d'une femme; il a toutesles petitesses, tous les caprices, toutes les exigences, tous lesridicules d'une coquette. Voila le caractere de la plupart des hommes detheatre. Il y a de grandes exceptions; elles sont si rares, elles sontsi meritoires, qu'il faut se prosterner devant elles; et leur faire plusd'honneur qu'aux docteurs les plus sages. Anzoleto n'est point uneexception; parmi les vaniteux, c'est un des plus vaniteux: voila tout lesecret de sa conduite.--Mais quelle vengeance incomprehensible! mais quels moyens pauvres etinefficaces! En quoi la Corilla peut-elle le dedommager de ses mecomptesaupres du public? S'il m'eut dit franchement sa souffrance ... (Ah! il nefallait qu'un mot pour cela!) je l'aurais comprise, peut-etre; du moinsj'y aurais compati; je me serais effacee pour lui faire place.--Le propre des ames envieuses est de hair les gens en raison du bonheurqu'ils leur derobent. Et le propre de l'amour, helas! n'est-il pas dedetester, dans l'objet qu'on aime, les plaisirs qu'on ne lui procurepas? Tandis que ton amant abhorre le public qui te comble de gloire, nehais-tu pas la rivale qui l'enivre de plaisirs?--Vous dites la, mon maitre, une chose profonde et a laquelle je veuxreflechir.--C'est une chose vraie. En meme temps qu'Anzoleto te hait pour tonbonheur sur la scene, tu le hais pour ses voluptes dans le boudoir de laCorilla.--Cela n'est pas. Je ne saurais le hair, et vous me faites comprendrequ'il serait lache et honteux de hair ma rivale. Reste donc ce plaisirdont elle l'enivre et auquel je ne puis songer sans fremir. Maispourquoi? je l'ignore. Si c'est un crime involontaire, Anzoleto n'estdonc pas si coupable de hair mon triomphe.--Tu es prompte a interpreter les choses de maniere a excuser saconduite et ses sentiments. Non, Anzoleto n'est pas innocent etrespectable comme toi dans sa souffrance. Il te trompe, il t'avilit,tandis que tu t'efforces de le rehabiliter. Au reste, ce n'est pas lahaine et le ressentiment que j'ai voulu t'inspirer; c'est le calme etl'indifference. Le caractere de cet homme entraine les actions de savie. Jamais tu ne le changeras. Prends ton parti, et songe a toi-meme.--A moi-meme! c'est-a-dire a moi seule? a moi sans espoir et sans amour?--Songe a la musique, a l'art divin, Consuelo; oserais-tu dire que tu nel'aimes que pour Anzoleto?--J'ai aime l'art pour lui-meme aussi; mais je n'avais jamais separedans ma pensee ces deux choses indivisibles: ma vie et celle d'Anzoleto.Et je ne vois pas comment il restera quelque chose de moi pour aimerquelque chose, quand la moitie necessaire de ma vie me sera enlevee.--Anzoleto n'etait pour toi qu'une idee, et cette idee te faisait vivre.Tu la remplaceras par une idee plus grande, plus pure et plusvivifiante. Ton ame, ton genie, ton etre enfin ne sera plus a la mercid'une forme fragile et trompeuse; tu contempleras l'ideal sublimedepouille de ce voile terrestre; tu t'elanceras dans le ciel, et tuvivras d'un hymen sacre avec Dieu meme.--Voulez-vous dire que je me ferai religieuse, comme vous m'y avezengagee autrefois?--Non, ce serait borner l'exercice de tes facultes d'artiste a un seulgenre, et tu dois les embrasser tous. Quoi que tu fasses et ou que tusois, au theatre comme dans le cloitre, tu peux etre une sainte, unevierge celeste, la fiancee de l'ideal sacre.--Ce que vous dites presente un sens sublime entoure de figuresmysterieuses. Laissez-moi me retirer, mon maitre. J'ai besoin de merecueillir et de me connaitre.--Tu as dit |e mot, Consuelo, tu as besoin de te connaitre. Jusqu'ici tut'es meconnue en livrant ton ame et ton avenir a un etre inferieur a toidans tous les sens. Tu as meconnu ta destinee, en ne voyant pas que tues nee sans egal, et par consequent sans associe possible en ce monde.Il te faut la solitude, la liberte absolue. Je ne te veux ni mari, niamant, ni famille, ni passions, ni liens d'aucune sorte. C'est ainsi quej'ai toujours concu ton existence et compris ta carriere. Le jour ou tute donneras a un mortel, tu perdras ta divinite. Ah! si la Minotaure etla Mollendo, mes illustres eleves, mes puissantes creations, avaientvoulu me croire, elles auraient vecu sans rivales sur la terre. Mais lafemme est faible et curieuse; la vanite l'aveugle, de vains desirsl'agitent, le caprice l'entraine. Qu'ont-elles recueilli de leurinquietude satisfaite? des orages, de la fatigue, la perte oul'alteration de leur genie. Ne voudras-tu pas etre plus qu'elles,Consuelo? n'auras-tu pas une ambition superieure a tous les faux biensde cette vie? ne voudras-tu pas eteindre les vains besoins de ton coeurpour saisir la plus belle couronne qui ait jamais servi d'aureole augenie?"Le Porpora parla encore longtemps, mais avec une energie et uneeloquence que je ne saurais vous rendre. Consuelo l'ecouta, la tetepenchee et les yeux attaches a la terre. Quand il eut tout dit: "Monmaitre, lui repondit-elle, vous etes grand; mais je ne le suis pas assezpour vous comprendre. Il me semble que vous outragez la nature humaineen proscrivant ses plus nobles passions. Il me semble que vous etouffezles instincts que Dieu meme nous a donnes, pour faire une sorte dedeification d'un egoisme monstrueux et antihumain. Peut-etre vouscomprendrais-je mieux si j'etais plus chretienne: je tacherai de ledevenir; voila ce que je puis vous promettre."Elle se retira tranquille en apparence, mais devoree au fond de l'ame.Le grand et sauvage artiste la reconduisit jusque chez elle,l'endoctrinant toujours, sans pouvoir la convaincre. Il lui fit du biencependant, en ouvrant a sa pensee, un vaste champ de meditationsprofondes et serieuses, au milieu desquelles le crime d'Anzoleto vints'abimer comme un fait particulier servant d'introduction douloureuse,mais solennelle, a des reveries infinies. Elle passa de longues heures aprier, a pleurer et a reflechir; et puis elle s'endormit avec laconscience de sa vertu, et l'esperance en un Dieu initiateur etsecourable.Le lendemain Porpora vint lui annoncer qu'il y aurait repetitiond'_Ipermnestre_ pour Stefanini, qui prenait le role d'Anzoleto. Cedernier etait malade, gardait le lit, et se plaignait d'une extinctionde voix. Le premier mouvement de Consuelo fut de courir chez lui pour lesoigner."Epargne-toi cette peine, lui dit le professeur; il se porte amerveille; le medecin du theatre l'a constate, et il ira ce soir chez laCorilla. Mais le comte Zustiniani, qui comprend fort bien ce que celaveut dire, et qui consent sans beaucoup de regrets a ce qu'il suspendeses debuts, a defendu au medecin de demasquer la feinte, et a prie lebon Stefanini de rentrer au theatre pour quelques jours.--Mais, mon Dieu, que compte donc faire Anzoleto? Est-il decourage aupoint de quitter le theatre?--Oui, le theatre de San-Samuel. Il part dans un mois, pour la Franceavec la Corilla. Cela t'etonne? Il fuit l'ombre que tu projettes surlui. Il remet son sort dans les mains d'une femme moins redoutable, etqu'il trahira quand il n'aura plus besoin d'elle."La Consuelo palit et mit les deux mains sur son coeur pret a se briser.Peut-etre s'etait-elle flattee de ramener Anzoleto, en lui reprochantdoucement sa faute; et en lui offrant de suspendre ses propres debuts.Cette nouvelle etait un coup de poignard, et la pensee de ne plus revoircelui qu'elle avait tant aime ne pouvait entrer dans son esprit:"Ah! c'est un mauvais reve, s'ecria-t-elle; il faut que j'aille letrouver et qu'il m'explique cette vision. Il ne peut pas suivre cettefemme, ce serait sa perte. Je ne peux pas, moi, l'y laisser courir; jele retiendrai, je lui ferai comprendre ses veritables interets, s'il estvrai qu'il ne comprenne plus autre chose ... Venez avec moi, mon chermaitre, ne l'abandonnons pas ainsi ...--Je t'abandonnerais, moi, et pour toujours, s'ecria le Porpora indigne,si tu commettais une pareille lachete. Implorer ce miserable, ledisputer a une Corilla? Ah! sainte Cecile, mefie-toi de ton originebohemienne, et songe a en etouffer les instincts aveugles et vagabonds.Allons, suis-moi: on t'attend pour repeter. Tu auras, malgre toi, uncertain plaisir ce soir a chanter avec un maitre comme Stefanini. Tuverras un artiste savant, modeste et genereux."Il la traina au theatre, et la, pour la premiere fois, elle sentitl'horreur de cette vie d'artiste, enchainee aux exigences du public,condamnee a etouffer ses sentiments et a refouler ses emotions pourobeir aux sentiments et flatter les emotions d'autrui. Cette repetition,ensuite la toilette, et la representation du soir furent un suppliceatroce. Anzoleto ne parut pas. Le surlendemain il fallait debuter dansun opera-bouffe de Galuppi: _Arcifanfano re de' matti_. On avait choisicette farce pour plaire a Stefanini, qui y etait d'un comique excellent.Il fallut que Consuelo s'evertuat a faire rire ceux qu'elle avait faitpleurer. Elle fut brillante, charmante, plaisante au dernier point avecla mort dans l'ame. Deux ou trois fois des sanglots remplirent sapoitrine et s'exhalerent en une gaite forcee, affreuse a voir pour quil'eut comprise! En rentrant dans sa loge elle tomba en convulsions. Lepublic voulait la revoir pour l'applaudir; elle tarda, on fit unhorrible vacarme; on voulait casser les banquettes, escalader la rampe.Stefanini vint la chercher a demi vetue, les cheveux en desordre, palecomme un spectre; elle se laissa trainer sur la scene, et, accableed'une pluie de fleurs, elle fut forcee de se baisser pour ramasser unecouronne de laurier."Ah! les betes feroces! murmura-t-elle en rentrant dans la coulisse.--Ma belle, lui dit le vieux chanteur qui lui donnait la main, tu esbien souffrante; mais ces petites choses-la, ajouta-t-il en luiremettant une gerbe des fleurs qu'il avait ramassees pour elle, sont unspecifique merveilleux pour tous nos maux. Tu t'y habitueras, et un jourviendra ou tu ne sentiras ton mal et ta fatigue que les jours ou l'onoubliera de te couronner.--Oh! qu'ils sont vains et petits! pensa la pauvre Consuelo."Rentree dans sa loge, elle s'evanouit litteralement sur un lit de fleursqu'on avait recueillies sur le theatre et jetees pele-mele sur le sofa.L'habilleuse sortit pour appeler un medecin. Le comte Zustiniani restaseul quelques instants aupres de sa belle cantatrice, pale et briseecomme les jasmins qui jonchaient sa couche. En cet instant de trouble etd'enivrement, Zustiniani perdit la tete et ceda a la folle inspirationde la ranimer par ses caresses. Mais son premier baiser fut odieux auxlevres pures de Consuelo. Elle se ranima pour le repousser, comme sic'eut ete la morsure d'un serpent."Ah! loin de moi, dit-elle en s'agitant dans une sorte de delire, loinde moi l'amour et les caresses et les douces paroles! Jamais d'amour!jamais d'epoux! jamais d'amant! jamais de famille! Mon maitre l'a dit!la liberte, l'ideal, la solitude, la gloire!..."Et elle fondit en larmes si dechirantes, que le comte effraye se jeta agenoux aupres d'elle et s'efforca de la calmer. Mais il ne put rien direde salutaire a cette ame blessee, et sa passion, arrivee en cet instanta son plus haut paroxysme, s'exprima en depit de lui-meme. Il necomprenait que trop le desespoir de l'amante trahie. Il fit parlerl'enthousiasme de l'amant qui espere. Consuelo eut l'air de l'ecouter,et retira machinalement sa main des siennes avec un sourire egare que lecomte prit pour un faible encouragement. Certains hommes, pleins de tactet de penetration dans le monde, sont absurdes dans de pareillesentreprises. Le medecin arriva et administra un calmant a la mode qu'onappelait _des gouttes_. Consuelo fut ensuite enveloppee de sa mante etportee dans sa gondole. Le comte y entra avec elle, la soutenant dansses bras et parlant toujours de son amour, voire avec une certaineeloquence qui lui semblait devoir porter la conviction. Au bout d'unquart d'heure, n'obtenant pas de reponse, il implora un mot, un regard."A quoi donc dois-je repondre? lui dit Consuelo, sortant comme d'unreve. Je n'ai rien entendu."Zustiniani, decourage d'abord, pensa que l'occasion ne pouvait revenirmeilleure, et que cette ame brisee serait plus accessible en cet instantqu'apres la reflexion et le conseil de la raison. Il parla donc encoreet trouva le meme silence, la meme preoccupation, seulement une sorted'empressement instinctif a repousser ses bras et ses levres qui ne sedementit pas, quoiqu'il n'y eut pas d'energie pour la colere. Quand lagondole aborda, il essaya de retenir Consuelo encore un instant pour enobtenir une parole plus encourageante."Ah! seigneur comte, lui repondit-elle avec une froide douceur, excusezl'etat de faiblesse ou je me trouve; j'ai mal ecoute, mais je comprends.Oh! oui, j'ai fort bien compris. Je vous demande la nuit pour reflechir,pour me remettre du trouble ou je suis. Demain, oui ... demain, je vousrepondrai sans detour.--Demain, chere Consuelo, oh! c'est un siecle; mais je me soumettrai sivous me permettez d'esperer que du moins votre amitie ...--Oh! oui! oui! il y a lieu d'esperer! repondit Consuelo d'un tonetrange en posant les pieds sur la rive; mais ne me suivez pas, dit-elleen faisant le geste imperieux de le repousser au fond de sa gondole.Sans cela vous n'auriez pas sujet d'esperer."La honte et l'indignation venaient de lui rendre la force; mais uneforce nerveuse, febrile, et qui s'exhala en un rire sardonique effrayanttandis qu'elle montait l'escalier."Vous etes bien joyeuse, Consuelo! lui dit dans l'obscurite une voix quifaillit la foudroyer. Je vous felicite de votre gaite!--Ah! oui, repondit-elle en saisissant avec force le bras d'Anzoleto eten montant rapidement avec lui a sa chambre; je te remercie, Anzoleto,tu as bien raison de me feliciter, je suis vraiment joyeuse; oh! tout afait joyeuse!"Anzoleto, qui l'avait entendue, avait deja allume la lampe. Quand laclarte bleuatre tomba sur leurs traits decomposes, ils se firent peurl'un a l'autre."Nous sommes bien heureux, n'est-ce pas, Anzoleto? dit-elle d'une voixapre, en contractant ses traits par un sourire qui fit couler sur sesjoues un ruisseau de larmes. Que penses-tu de notre bonheur?--Je pense, Consuelo repondit-il avec un sourire amer et des yeux secs,que nous avons eu quelque peine a y souscrire, mais que nous finironspar nous y habituer.--Tu m'as semble fort bien habitue au boudoir de la Corilla.--Et-moi, je te retrouve tres-aguerrie avec la gondole de monsieur lecomte.--Monsieur le comte?... Tu savais donc, Anzoleto, que monsieur le comtevoulait faire de moi sa maitresse?--Et c'est pour ne pas te gener, ma chere, que j'ai discretement battuen retraite.--Ah! tu savais cela? et c'est le moment que tu as choisi pourm'abandonner?--N'ai-je pas bien fait, et n'es-tu pas satisfaite de ton sort? Le comteest un amant magnifique, et le pauvre debutant tombe n'eut pas pu lutteravec lui, je pense?--Le Porpora avait raison: vous etes un homme infame. Sortez d'ici! vousne meritez pas que je me justifie, et il me semble que je seraissouillee par un regret de vous. Sortez, vous dis-je! Mais sachezauparavant que vous pouvez debuter a Venise et rentrer a San-Samuel avecla Corilla: jamais plus la fille de ma mere ne remettra les pieds surces ignobles treteaux qu'on appelle le theatre.--La fille de votre mere la _Zingara_ va donc faire la grande dame dansla villa de Zustiniani, aux bords de la Brenta? Ce sera une belleexistence, et je m'en rejouis!--O ma mere!" dit Consuelo en se retournant vers son lit, et en s'yjetant a genoux, la face enfoncee dans la couverture qui avait servi delinceul a la zingara.Anzoleto fut effraye et penetre de ce mouvement energique et de cessanglots terribles qu'il entendait gronder dans la poitrine de Consuelo.Le remords frappa un grand coup dans la sienne, et il s'approcha pourprendre son amie dans ses bras et la relever. Mais elle se relevad'elle-meme, et le repoussant avec une force sauvage, elle le jeta a laporte en lui criant: "Hors de chez moi, hors de mon coeur, hors de monsouvenir! A tout jamais, adieu! adieu!"Anzoleto etait venu la trouver avec une pensee d'egoisme atroce, etc'etait pourtant la meilleure pensee qu'il eut pu concevoir. Il nes'etait pas senti la force de s'eloigner d'elle, et il avait trouve unterme moyen pour tout concilier: c'etait de lui dire qu'elle etaitmenacee dans son honneur par les projets amoureux de Zustiniani, et del'eloigner ainsi du theatre. Il y avait, dans cette resolution, unhommage rendu a la purete et a la fierte de Consuelo. Il la savaitincapable de transiger avec une position equivoque, et d'accepter uneprotection qui la ferait rougir. Il y avait encore dans son ame coupableet corrompue une foi inebranlable dans l'innocence de cette jeune fille,qu'il comptait retrouver aussi chaste, aussi fidele; aussi devouee qu'ill'avait laissee quelques jours auparavant. Mais comment concilier cettereligion envers elle, avec le dessein arrete de la tromper et de resterson fiance, son ami, sans rompre avec la Corilla? Il voulait fairerentrer cette derniere avec lui au theatre, et ne pouvait songer a s'endetacher dans un moment ou son succes allait dependre d'elleentierement. Ce plan audacieux et lache etait cependant formule dans sapensee, et il traitait Consuelo comme ces madones dont les femmesitaliennes implorent la protection a l'heure du repentir, et dont ellesvoilent la face a l'heure du peche.Quand il la vit si brillante et si folle en apparence au theatre, dansson role bouffe, il commenca a craindre d'avoir perdu trop de temps amurir son projet. Quand il la vit rentrer dans la gondole du comte, etapprocher avec un eclat de rire convulsif, ne comprenant pas la detressede cette ame en delire, il pensa qu'il venait trop tard, et le depits'empara de lui. Mais quand il la vit se relever de ses insultes et lechasser avec mepris, le respect lui revint avec la crainte, et il erralongtemps dans l'escalier et sur la rive attendant qu'elle le rappelat.Il se hasarda meme a frapper et a implorer son pardon a travers laporte. Mais un profond silence regna dans cette chambre, dont il nedevait plus jamais repasser le seuil avec Consuelo. Il se retira confuset depite, se promettant de revenir le lendemain et se flattant d'etreplus heureux. "Apres tout, se disait-il, mon projet va reussir; ellesait l'amour du comte; la besogne est a moitie faite."Accable de fatigue, il dormit longtemps; et dans l'apres-midi il serendit chez la Corilla."Grande nouvelle! s'ecria-t-elle en lui tendant les bras: la Consueloest partie!--Partie! et avec qui, grand Dieu! et pour quel pays?--Pour Vienne, ou le Porpora l'envoie, en attendant qu'il s'y rendelui-meme. Elle nous a tous trompes, cette petite masque. Elle etaitengagee pour le theatre de l'empereur, ou le Porpora va fairerepresenter son nouvel opera.--Partie! partie sans me dire un mot! s'ecria Anzoleto en courant versla porte.--Oh! rien ne te servira de la chercher a Venise, dit la Corilla avec unrire mechant et un regard de triomphe. Elle s'est embarquee pourPalestrine au jour naissant; elle est deja loin en terre ferme.Zustiniani, qui se croyait aime et qui etait joue, est furieux; il estau lit avec la fievre. Mais il m'a depeche tout a l'heure le Porpora,pour me prier de chanter ce soir; et Stefanini, qui est tres-fatigue dutheatre et tres impatient d'aller jouir dans son chateau des douceurs dela retraite, est fort desireux de te voir reprendre tes debuts. Ainsisonge a reparaitre demain dans, _Ipermnestre_. Moi, je vais a larepetition: on m'attend. Tu peux, si tu ne me crois pas, aller faire untour dans la ville, tu te convaincras de la verite.--Ah! furie! s'ecria Anzoleto, tu l'emportes! mais tu m'arraches lavie."Et il tomba evanoui sur le tapis de Perse de la courtisane.XXI.Le plus embarrasse de son role, lors de la fuite de Consuelo, ce fut lecomte Zustiniani. Apres avoir laisse dire et donne a penser a toutVenise que la merveilleuse debutante etait sa maitresse, commentexpliquer d'une maniere flatteuse pour son amour-propre qu'au premiermot de declaration elle s'etait soustraite brusquement etmysterieusement a ses desirs et a ses esperances? Plusieurs personnespenserent que, jaloux de son tresor, il l'avait cachee dans une de sesmaisons de campagne. Mais lorsqu'on entendit le Porpora dire avec cetteausterite de franchise qui ne s'etait jamais dementie, le parti qu'avaitpris son eleve d'aller l'attendre en Allemagne, il n'y eut plus qu'achercher les motifs de cette etrange resolution. Le comte affecta bien,pour donner le change, de ne montrer ni depit ni surprise; mais sonchagrin perca malgre lui, et on cessa de lui attribuer cette bonnefortune dont on l'avait tant felicite. La majeure partie de la veritedevint claire pour tout le monde; savoir: l'infidelite d'Anzoleto, larivalite de Corilla, et le desespoir de la pauvre Espagnole, qu'on seprit a plaindre et a regretter vivement.Le premier mouvement d'Anzoleto avait ete de courir chez le Porpora;mais celui-ci l'avait repousse severement:"Cesse de m'interroger, jeune ambitieux sans coeur et sans-foi, luiavait repondu le maitre indigne; tu ne meritas jamais l'affection decette noble fille, et tu ne sauras jamais de moi ce qu'elle est devenue.Je mettrai tous mes soins a ce que tu ne retrouves pas sa trace, etj'espere que si le hasard te la fait rencontrer un jour, ton image seraeffacee de son coeur et de sa memoire autant que je le desire et que j'ytravaille."De chez le Porpora, Anzoleto s'etait rendu a la Corte-Minelli. Il avaittrouve la chambre de Consuelo deja livree a un nouvel occupant et toutencombree des materiaux de son travail. C'etait un ouvrier enverroterie, installe depuis longtemps dans la maison, et quitransportait la son atelier avec beaucoup de gaiete."Ah!'ah! c'est toi mon garcon, dit-il au jeune tenor. Tu viens me voirdans mon nouveau logement? J'y serai fort bien, et ma femme est toutejoyeuse d'avoir de quoi loger tous ses enfants en bas. Que cherches-tu?Consuelina aurait-elle oublie quelque chose ici? Cherche, mon enfant;regarde. Cela ne me fache point.--Ou a-t-on mis ses meubles? dit Anzoleto tout trouble, et dechire aufond du coeur de ne plus retrouver aucun vestige de Consuelo, dans celieu consacre aux plus pures jouissances de toute sa vie passee.--Les meubles sont en bas, dans la cour. Elle en a fait cadeau a la mereAgathe; elle a bien fait. La vieille est pauvre, et va se faire un peud'argent avec cela. Oh! la Consuelo a toujours eu un bon coeur. Elle n'apas laisse un sou de dette dans la _Corte_; et elle a fait un petitpresent a tout le monde en s'en allant. Elle n'a emporte que soncrucifix. C'est drole tout de meme, ce depart, au milieu de la nuit etsans prevenir personne! Maitre Porpora est venu ici des le matinarranger toutes ses affaires; c'etait comme l'execution d'un testament.Ca a fait de la peine a tous les voisins; mais enfin on s'en console enpensant qu'elle va habiter sans doute un beau palais sur le Canalazzo, apresent qu'elle est riche et grande dame! Moi, j'avais toujours ditqu'elle ferait fortune avec sa voix. Elle travaillait tant! Et a quandla noce, Anzoleto? J'espere que tu m'acheteras quelque chose pour fairede petits presents aux jeunes filles du quartier.--Oui, oui! repondit Anzoleto tout egare."Il s'enfuit la mort dans l'ame, et vit dans la cour toutes les commeresde l'endroit qui mettaient a l'enchere le lit et la table de Consuelo;ce lit ou il l'avait vue dormir, cette table ou il l'avait vuetravailler!"O mon Dieu! deja plus rien d'elle!" s'ecria-t-il involontairement en setordant les mains.Il eut envie d'aller poignarder la Corilla.Au bout de trois jours il remonta sur le theatre avec la Corilla. Tousdeux furent outrageusement siffles, et on fut oblige de baisser lerideau sans pouvoir achever la piece: Anzoleto etait furieux, et laCorilla impassible."Voila ce que me vaut ta protection," lui dit-il d'un ton menacant desqu'il se retrouva seul avec elle.La prima-donna lui repondit avec beaucoup de tranquillite:"Tu t'affectes de peu, mon pauvre enfant; on voit que tu ne connaisguere le public et que tu n'as jamais affronte ses caprices. J'etais sibien preparee a l'echec de ce soir, que je ne m'etais pas donne la peinede repasser mon role: et si je ne t'ai pas annonce ce qui devaitarriver, c'est parce que je savais bien que tu n'aurais pas le couraged'entrer en scene avec la certitude d'etre siffle. Maintenant il fautque tu saches ce qui nous attend encore. La prochaine fois nous seronsmaltraites de plus belle. Trois, quatre, six, huit representationspeut-etre, se passeront ainsi; mais durant ces orages une opposition semanifestera en notre faveur. Fussions-nous les derniers cabotins dumonde, l'esprit de contradiction et d'independance nous susciteraitencore des partisans de plus en plus zeles. Il y a tant de gens quicroient se grandir en outrageant les autres, qu'il n'en manque pas quicroient se grandir aussi en les protegeant. Apres une douzained'epreuves, durant lesquelles la salle sera un champ de bataille entreles sifflets et les applaudissements, les recalcitrants se fatigueront,les opiniatres bouderont, et nous entrerons dans une nouvelle phase. Laportion du public qui nous aura soutenus sans trop savoir pourquoi, nousecoutera assez froidement; ce sera pour nous comme un nouveau debut, etalors; c'est a nous, vive Dieu! de passionner cet auditoire, et derester les maitres. Je te predis de grands succes pour ce moment-la,cher Anzoleto; le charme qui pesait sur toi naguere sera dissipe. Turespireras une atmosphere d'encouragements et de douces louanges qui terendra ta puissance. Rappelle-toi l'effet que tu as produit chezZustiniani la premiere fois que tu t'es fait entendre. Tu n'eus pas letemps de consolider ta conquete; un astre plus brillant est venu troptot t'eclipser: mais cet astre s'est laisse retomber sous l'horizon, ettu dois te preparer a remonter avec moi dans l'empyree."Tout se passa ainsi que la Corilla l'avait predit. A la verite, on fitpayer cher aux deux amants, pendant quelques jours, la perte que lepublic avait faite dans la personne de Consuelo. Mais leur constance abraver la tempete epuisa un courroux trop expansif pour etre durable. Lecomte encouragea les efforts de Corilla. Quant a Anzoleto, apres avoirfait de vaines demarches pour attirer a Venise un _primo-uomo_ dans unesaison avancee, ou tous les engagements etaient faits avec lesprincipaux theatres de l'Europe, le comte prit son parti, et l'acceptapour champion dans la lutte qui s'etablissait entre le public etl'administration de son theatre. Ce theatre avait eu une vogue tropbrillante pour la perdre avec tel ou tel sujet. Rien de semblable nepouvait vaincre les habitudes consacrees. Toutes les loges etaientlouees pour la saison. Les dames y tenaient leur salon et y causaientcomme de coutume. Les vrais dilettanti bouderent quelque temps; ilsetaient en trop petit nombre pour qu'on s'en apercut. D'ailleurs ilsfinirent par s'ennuyer de leur rancune, et un beau soir la Corilla,ayant chante avec feu, fut unanimement rappelee. Elle reparut,entrainant avec elle Anzoleto, qu'on ne redemandait pas, et qui semblaitceder a une douce violence d'un air modeste et craintif. Il recut sapart des applaudissements, et fut rappele le lendemain. Enfin, avantqu'un mois se fut ecoule, Consuelo etait oubliee, comme l'eclair quitraverse un ciel d'ete. Corilla faisait fureur comme auparavant, et lemeritait peut-etre davantage; car l'emulation lui avait donne plusd'_entrain_, et l'amour lui inspirait parfois une expression mieuxsentie. Quant a Anzoleto, quoiqu'il n'eut point perdu ses defauts, ilavait reussi a deployer ses incontestables qualites. On s'etait habitueaux uns, et on admirait les autres. Sa personne charmante fascinait lesfemmes: on se l'arrachait dans les salons, d'autant plus que la jalousiede Corilla donnait plus de piquant aux coquetteries dont il etaitl'objet. La Clorinda aussi developpait ses moyens au theatre,c'est-a-dire sa lourde beaute et la nonchalance lascive d'une stupiditesans exemple, mais non sans attrait pour une certaine fraction desspectateurs. Zustiniani, pour se distraire d'un chagrin assez profond,en avait fait sa maitresse, la couvrait de diamants, et la poussait auxpremiers roles, esperant la faire succeder dans cet emploi a la Corilla,qui s'etait definitivement engagee avec Paris pour la saison suivante.Corilla voyait sans depit cette concurrence dont elle n'avait rien acraindre, ni dans le present, ni dans l'avenir; elle prenait meme unmechant plaisir a faire ressortir cette incapacite froidement impudentequi ne reculait devant rien. Ces deux creatures vivaient donc en bonneintelligence, et gouvernaient souverainement l'administration. Ellesmettaient a l'index toute partition serieuse, et se vengeaient duPorpora en refusant ses operas pour accepter et faire briller ses plusindignes rivaux. Elles s'entendaient pour nuire a tout ce qui leurdeplaisait, pour proteger tout ce qui s'humiliait devant leur pouvoir.Grace a elles, on applaudit cette annee-la a Venise les oeuvres de ladecadence, et on oublia que la vraie, la grande musique y avait regnenaguere.Au milieu de son succes et de sa prosperite (car le comte lui avait faitun engagement assez avantageux), Anzoleto etait accable d'un profonddegout, et succombait sous le poids d'un bonheur deplorable. C'etaitpitie de le voir se trainer aux repetitions, attache au bras de latriomphante Corilla, pale, languissant, beau comme un ange, ridicule defatuite, ennuye comme un homme qu'on adore, aneanti et debraille sousles lauriers et les myrtes qu'il avait si aisement et si largementcueillis. Meme aux representations, lorsqu'il etait en scene avec safougueuse amante, il cedait au besoin de protester contre elle par sonattitude superbe et sa langueur impertinente. Lorsqu'elle le devoraitdes yeux, il semblait, par ses regards, dire au public: N'allez pascroire que je reponde a tant d'amour. Qui m'en delivrera, au contraire,me rendra un grand service.Le fait est qu'Anzoleto, gate et corrompu par la Corilla, tournaitcontre elle les instincts d'egoisme et d'ingratitude qu'elle luisuggerait contre le monde entier. Il ne lui restait plus dans le coeurqu'un sentiment vrai et pur dans son essence: l'indestructible amourqu'en depit de ses vices il nourrissait pour Consuelo. Il pouvait s'endistraire, grace a sa legerete naturelle; mais il n'en pouvait pasguerir, et cet amour lui revenait comme un remords, comme une torture,au milieu de ses plus coupables egarements. Infidele a la Corilla,adonne a mille intrigues galantes, un jour avec la Clorinda pour sevenger en secret du comte, un autre avec quelque illustre beaute dugrand monde, et le troisieme avec la plus malpropre des comparses;passant du boudoir mysterieux a l'orgie insolente, et des fureurs de laCorilla aux insouciantes debauches de la table, il semblait qu'il eutpris a tache d'etouffer en lui tout souvenir du passe. Mais au milieu dece desordre, un spectre semblait s'acharner a ses pas; et de longssanglots s'echappaient de sa poitrine, lorsqu'au milieu de la nuit, ilpassait en gondole, avec ses bruyants compagnons de plaisir, le long dessombres masures de la Corte-Minelli.La Corilla, longtemps dominee par ses mauvais traitements, et portee,comme toutes les ames viles, a n'aimer qu'en raison des mepris et desoutrages qu'elle recevait, commencait pourtant elle-meme a se lasser decette passion funeste. Elle s'etait flattee de vaincre et d'enchainercette sauvage independance. Elle y avait travaille avec acharnement,elle y avait tout sacrifie. Quand elle reconnut qu'elle n'y parviendraitjamais, elle commenca a le hair, et a chercher des distractions et desvengeances. Une nuit qu'Anzoleto errait en gondole dans Venise avec laClorinda, il vit filer rapidement une autre gondole dont le fanal eteintannoncait quelque furtif rendez-vous. Il y fit peu d'attention; mais laClorinda, qui, dans sa frayeur d'etre decouverte, etait toujours auxaguets, lui dit:"Allons plus lentement. C'est la gondole du comte; j'ai reconnu legondolier.--En ce cas, allons plus vite, repondit Anzoleto; je veux le rejoindre,et savoir de quelle infidelite il paie la tienne cette nuit.--Non, non, retournons! s'ecria Clorinda. Il a l'oeil si percant; etl'oreille si fine! Gardons-nous bien de le troubler.--Marche! te dis-je, cria Anzoleto a son barcarolle; je veux rejoindrecette barque que tu vois la devant nous."Ce fut, malgre la priere et la terreur de Clorinda, l'affaire d'uninstant. Les deux barques s'effleurerent de nouveau, et Anzoletoentendit un eclat de rire mal etouffe partir de la gondole."A la bonne heure, dit-il, ceci est de bonne guerre: c'est la Corillaqui prend le frais avec monsieur le comte."En parlant ainsi, Anzoleto sauta sur l'avant de sa gondole, prit la ramedes mains de son barcarolle, et suivant l'autre gondole avec rapidite,la rejoignit, l'effleura de nouveau, et, soit qu'il eut entendu son nomau milieu des eclats de rire de la Corilla, soit qu'un acces de demencese fut empare de lui, il se mit a dire tout haut:"Chere Clorinda, tu es sans contredit la plus belle et la plus aimee detoutes les femmes.--J'en disais autant tout a l'heure a la Corilla, repondit aussitot lecomte en sortant de sa cabanette, et en s'avancant vers l'autre barqueavec une grande aisance; et maintenant que nos promenades sont termineesde part et d'autre, nous pourrions faire un echange, comme entre gens debonne foi qui trafiquent de richesses equivalentes:"Monsieur le comte rend justice a ma loyaute, repondit Anzoleto sur lememe ton. Je vais, s'il veut bien le permettre, lui offrir mon bras pourqu'il puisse venir reprendre son bien ou il le retrouve."Le comte avanca le bras pour s'appuyer sur Anzoleto, dans je ne saisquelle intention railleuse et meprisante pour lui et leurs communesmaitresses. Mais le tenor, devore de haine, et transporte d'une rageprofonde, s'elanca de tout le poids de son corps sur la gondole ducomte, et la fit chavirer en s'ecriant d'une voix sauvage:"Femme pour femme, monsieur le comte; et _gondole pour gondole!_"Puis, abandonnant ses victimes a leur destinee, ainsi que la Clorinda asa stupeur et aux consequences de l'aventure, il gagna a la nage la riveopposee, prit sa course a travers les rues sombres et tortueuses, entradans son logement, changea de vetements en un clin d'oeil, emporta toutl'argent qu'il possedait, sortit, se jeta dans la premiere chaloupe quimettait a la voile; et, cinglant vers Trieste, il fit claquer ses doigtsen signe de triomphe, en voyant les clochers et les domes de Venises'abaisser sous les flots aux premieres clartes du matin.XXII.Dans la ramification occidentale des monts Carpathes qui separe laBoheme de la Baviere, et qui prend dans ces contrees le nom deBoehmer-Wald (foret de Boheme), s'elevait encore, il y a une centained'annees, un vieux manoir tres vaste, appele, en vertu de je ne saisquelle tradition, le _Chateau des Geants_. Quoiqu'il eut de loinl'apparence d'une antique forteresse, ce n'etait plus qu'une maison deplaisance, decoree a l'interieur, dans le gout, deja suranne a cetteepoque, mais toujours somptueux et noble, de Louis XIV. L'architecturefeodale avait aussi subi d'heureuses modifications dans les parties del'edifice occupees par les seigneurs de Rudolstadt, maitres de ce richedomaine.Cette famille, d'origine boheme, avait germanise son nom en abjurant laReforme a l'epoque la plus tragique de la guerre de trente ans. Un nobleet vaillant aieul, protestant inflexible, avait ete massacre sur lamontagne voisine de son chateau par la soldatesque fanatique. Sa veuve,qui etait de famille saxonne, sauva la fortune et la vie de ses jeunesenfants, en se proclamant catholique, et en confiant l'education desheritiers de Rudolstadt a des jesuites. Apres deux generations, laBoheme etant muette et opprimee, la puissance autrichiennedefinitivement affermie, la gloire et les malheurs de la Reformeoublies, du moins en apparence, les seigneurs de Rudolstadt pratiquaientdoucement les vertus chretiennes, professaient le dogme romain, etvivaient dans leurs terres avec une somptueuse simplicite, en bonsaristocrates et en fideles serviteurs de Marie-Therese. Ils avaient faitleurs preuves de bravoure autrefois au service de l'empereur Charles VI.Mais on s'etonnait que le dernier de cette race illustre et vaillante,le jeune Albert, fils unique du comte Christian de Rudolstadt, n'eutpoint porte les armes dans la guerre de succession qui venait de finir,et qu'il fut arrive a l'age de trente ans sans avoir connu ni recherched'autre grandeur que celle de sa naissance et de sa fortune. Cetteconduite etrange avait inspire a sa souveraine des soupcons decomplicite avec ses ennemis. Mais le comte Christian, ayant eu l'honneurde recevoir l'imperatrice dans son chateau, lui avait donne de laconduite de son fils des excuses dont elle avait paru satisfaite. Del'entretien de Marie-Therese avec le comte de Rudolstadt, rien n'avaittranspire. Un mystere etrange regnait dans le sanctuaire de cettefamille devote et bienfaisante, que, depuis dix ans, aucun voisin nefrequentait assidument; qu'aucune affaire, aucun plaisir, aucuneagitation politique ne faisait sortir de ses domaines; qui payaitlargement, et sans murmurer, tous les subsides de la guerre, ne montrantaucune agitation au milieu des dangers et des malheurs publics; qui,enfin, ne semblait plus vivre de la meme vie que les autres nobles, etde laquelle on se mefiait, bien qu'on n'eut jamais eu a enregistrer deses faits exterieurs que de bonnes actions et de nobles procedes. Nesachant a quoi attribuer cette vie froide et retiree, on accusait lesRudolstadt, tantot de misanthropie, tantot d'avarice; mais comme, achaque instant, leur conduite donnait un dementi a ces imputations, onetait reduit a leur reprocher simplement trop d'apathie et denonchalance. On disait que le comte Christian n'avait pas voulu exposerles jours de son fils unique, dernier heritier de son nom, dans cesguerres desastreuses, et que l'imperatrice avait accepte, en echange deses services militaires, une somme d'argent assez forte pour equiper unregiment de hussards. Les nobles dames qui avaient des filles a marierdisaient que le comte avait fort bien agi; mais lorsqu'elles apprirentla resolution que semblait manifester Christian de marier son fils danssa propre famille, en lui faisant epouser la fille du baron Frederick,son frere; quand elles surent que la jeune baronne Amelie venait dequitter le couvent ou elle avait ete elevee a Prague, pour habiterdesormais, aupres de son cousin, le chateau des Geants, ces nobles damesdeclarerent unanimement que la famille des Rudolstadt etait une tanierede loups, tous plus insociables et plus sauvages les uns que les autres.Quelques serviteurs incorruptibles et quelques amis devoues surent seulsle secret de la famille, et le garderent fidelement.Cette noble famille etait rassemblee un soir autour d'une table chargeea profusion de gibier et de ces mets substantiels dont nos aieux senourrissaient encore a cette epoque dans les pays slaves, en depit desraffinements que la cour de Louis XV avait introduits dans les habitudesaristocratiques d'une grande partie de l'Europe. Un poele immense, oubrulaient des chenes tout entiers, rechauffait la salle vaste et sombre.Le comte Christian venait d'achever a voix haute le _Benedicite_, queles autres membres de la famille avaient ecoute debout. De nombreuxserviteurs, tous vieux et graves, en costume du pays, en larges culottesde Mameluks, et en longues moustaches, se pressaient lentement autour deleurs maitres reveres. Le chapelain du chateau s'assit a la droite ducomte, et sa niece, la jeune baronne Amelie, a sa gauche, le _cote ducoeur_, comme il affectait de le dire avec un air de galanterie austereet paternelle. Le baron Frederick, son frere puine, qu'il appelaittoujours son jeune frere, parce qu'il n'avait guere que soixante ans, seplaca en face de lui. La chanoinesse Wenceslawa de Rudolstadt, sa soeurainee, respectable personnage sexagenaire afflige d'une bosse enorme etd'une maigreur effrayante, s'assit a un bout de la table, et le comteAlbert, fils du comte Christian, le fiance d'Amelie, le dernier desRudolstadt, vint, pale et morne, s'installer d'un air distrait a l'autrebout, vis-a-vis de sa noble tante.De tous ces personnages silencieux, Albert etait certainement le moinsdispose et le moins habitue a donner de l'animation aux autres. Lechapelain etait si devoue a ses maitres et si respectueux envers le chefde la famille, qu'il n'ouvrait guere la bouche sans y etre sollicite parun regard du comte Christian; et celui-ci etait d'une nature si paisibleet si recueillie, qu'il n'eprouvait presque jamais le besoin de chercherdans les autres une distraction a ses propres pensees.Le baron Frederick etait un caractere moins profond et un temperamentplus actif; mais son esprit n'etait guere plus anime. Aussi doux etaussi bienveillant que son aine, il avait moins d'intelligence etd'enthousiasme interieur. Sa devotion etait toute d'habitude et desavoir-vivre. Son unique passion etait la chasse. Il y passait toutesses journees, rentrait chaque soir, non fatigue (c'etait un corps defer), mais rouge, essouffle, et affame. Il mangeait comme dix, buvaitcomme trente, s'egayait un peu au dessert en racontant comment son chienSaphyr avait force le lievre, comment sa chienne Panthere avait depistele loup, comment son faucon Attila avait pris le vol; et quand onl'avait ecoute avec une complaisance inepuisable, il s'assoupissaitdoucement aupres du feu dans un grand fauteuil de cuir noir jusqu'a ceque sa fille l'eut averti que son heure d'aller se mettre au lit venaitde sonner.La chanoinesse etait la plus causeuse de la famille. Elle pouvait memepasser pour babillarde; car il lui arrivait au moins deux fois parsemaine de discuter un quart d'heure durant avec le chapelain sur lagenealogie des familles bohemes, hongroises et saxonnes, qu'elle savaitsur le bout de son doigt, depuis celle des rois jusqu'a celle du moindregentilhomme.Quant au comte Albert, son exterieur avait quelque chose d'effrayant etde solennel pour les autres, comme si chacun de ses gestes eut ete unpresage, et chacune de ses paroles une sentence. Par une bizarrerieinexplicable a quiconque n'etait pas initie au secret de la maison, desqu'il ouvrait la bouche, ce qui n'arrivait pas toujours une fois parvingt-quatre heures, tous les regards des parents et des serviteurs seportaient sur lui; et alors on eut pu lire sur tous les visages uneanxiete profonde, une sollicitude douloureuse et tendre exceptecependant sur celui de la jeune Amelie, qui n'accueillait pas toujoursses paroles sans un melange d'impatience ou de moquerie, et qui, seule,osait y repondre avec une familiarite dedaigneuse ou enjouee, suivant sadisposition du moment.Cette jeune fille, blonde, un peu haute en couleur, vive et bien faite,etait une petite perle de beaute; et quand sa femme de chambre le luidisait pour la consoler de son ennui: "Helas! repondait la jeune fille,je suis une perle enfermee dans ma triste famille comme dans une huitredont cet affreux chateau des Geants est l'ecaille." C'est en dire assezpour faire comprendre au lecteur quel petulant oiseau renfermait cetteimpitoyable cage.Ce soir-la le silence solennel qui pesait sur la famille,particulierement au premier service (car les deux vieux seigneurs, lachanoinesse et le chapelain avaient une solidite et une regularited'appetit qui ne se dementaient en aucune saison de l'annee), futinterrompue par le comte Albert."Quel temps affreux!" dit-il avec un profond soupir.Chacun se regarda avec surprise; car si le temps etait devenu sombre etmenacant, depuis une heure qu'on se tenait dans l'interieur du chateauet que les epais volets de chene etaient fermes, nul ne pouvait s'enapercevoir. Un calme profond regnait au dehors comme au dedans, et rienn'annoncait qu'une tempete dut eclater prochainement.Cependant nul ne s'avisa de contredire Albert; et Amelie seule secontenta de hausser les epaules, tandis que le jeu des fourchettes et lecliquetis de la vaisselle, echangee lentement par les valets,recommencait apres un moment d'interruption et d'inquietude."N'entendez-vous pas le vent qui se dechaine dans les sapins duBoehmer-Wald, et la voix du torrent qui monte jusqu'a vous?" repritAlbert d'une voix plus haute, et avec un regard fixe dirige vers sonpere.Le comte Christian ne repondit rien. Le baron, qui avait coutume de toutconcilier, repondit, sans quitter des yeux le morceau de venaison qu'iltaillait d'une main athletique comme il eut fait d'un quartier degranit:"En effet, le vent etait a la pluie au coucher du soleil, et nouspourrions bien avoir mauvais temps pour la journee de demain."Albert sourit d'un air etrange, et tout redevint morne.Mais cinq minutes s'etaient a peine ecoulees qu'un coup de vent terribleebranla les vitraux des immenses croisees, rugit a plusieurs reprises enbattant comme d'un fouet les eaux du fosse, et se perdit dans leshauteurs de la montagne avec un gemissement si aigu et si plaintif quetous les visages en palirent, a l'exception de celui d'Albert, quisourit encore avec la meme expression indefinissable que la premierefois."Il y a en ce moment, dit-il, une ame que l'orage pousse vers nous. Vousferiez bien, monsieur le chapelain, de prier pour ceux qui voyagent dansnos apres montagnes sous le coup de la tempete.--Je prie a toute heure et du fond de mon ame, repondit le chapelaintout tremblant, pour ceux qui cheminent dans les rudes sentiers de lavie, sous la tempete des passions humaines.--Ne lui repondez donc pas, monsieur le chapelain, dit Amelie sans faireattention aux regards et aux signes qui l'avertissaient de tous cotes dene pas donner de suite a cet entretien; vous savez bien que mon cousinse fait un plaisir de tourmenter les autres en leur parlant par enigmes.Quant a moi, je ne tiens guere a savoir le mot des siennes."Le comte Albert ne parut pas faire plus attention aux dedains de sacousine qu'elle ne pretendait en accorder a ses discours bizarres. Ilmit un coude dans son assiette, qui etait presque toujours vide et nettedevant lui, et regarda fixement la nappe damassee, dont il semblaitcompter les fleurons et les rosaces, bien qu'il fut absorbe dans unesorte de reve extatique.XXIII.Une tempete furieuse eclata durant le souper; lequel durait toujoursdeux heures, ni plus ni moins, meme les jours d'abstinence, que l'onobservait religieusement, mais qui ne degageaient point le comte du jougde ses habitudes, aussi sacrees pour lui que les ordonnances de l'egliseromaine. L'orage etait trop frequent dans ces montagnes, et les immensesforets qui couvraient encore leurs flancs a cette epoque, donnaient aubruit du vent et de la foudre des retentissements et des echos tropconnus des hotes du chateau, pour qu'un accident de cette nature lesemut enormement. Cependant l'agitation extraordinaire que montrait lecomte Albert se communiqua involontairement a la famille; et le baron,trouble dans les douceurs de sa refection, en eut eprouve quelquehumeur, s'il eut ete possible a sa douceur bienveillante de se dementirun seul instant. Il se contenta de soupirer profondement lorsqu'unepouvantable eclat de la foudre, survenu a l'entremets, impressionnal'ecuyer tranchant au point de lui faire manquer la _noix_ du jambon desanglier qu'il entamait en cet instant."C'est une affaire faite! dit-il, en adressant un sourire compatissantau pauvre ecuyer consterne de sa mesaventure.--Oui, mon oncle, vous avez raison! s'ecria le comte Albert d'une voixforte, et en se levant; c'est une affaire faite. Le _Hussite_ estabattu; la foudre le consume. Le printemps ne reverdira plus sonfeuillage.--Que veux-tu dire, mon fils? demanda le vieux Christian avec tristesse;parles-tu du grand chene de Schreckenstein[1]?[1 Schreckenstein (_pierre d'epouvante_); plusieurs endroits portent cenom dans ces contrees.]--Oui, mon pere, je parle du grand chene aux branches duquel nous avonsfait pendre, l'autre semaine, plus de vingt moines augustins.--Il prend les siecles pour des semaines, a present! dit la chanoinessea voix basse en faisant un grand signe de croix. S'il est vrai, mon cherenfant, ajouta-t-elle plus haut et en s'adressant a son neveu, que vousayez vu dans votre reve une chose reellement arrivee, ou devant arriverprochainement (comme en effet ce hasard singulier s'est rencontreplusieurs fois dans votre imagination), ce ne sera pas une grande pertepour nous que ce vilain chene a moitie desseche, qui nous rappelle,ainsi que le rocher qu'il ombrage, de si funestes souvenirs historiques.--Quant a moi, reprit vivement Amelie, heureuse de trouver enfin uneoccasion de degourdir un peu sa petite langue, je remercierais l'oragede nous avoir debarrasses du spectacle de cette affreuse potence dontles branches ressemblent a des ossements, et dont le tronc couvert d'unemousse rougeatre parait toujours suinter du sang. Je ne suis jamaispassee le soir sous son ombre sans frissonner au souffle du vent quirale dans son feuillage, comme des soupirs d'agonie, et je recommandealors mon ame a Dieu tout en doublant le pas et en detournant la tete.--Amelie, reprit le jeune comte, qui, pour la premiere fois peut-etre,depuis bien des jours, avait ecoute avec attention les paroles de sacousine, vous avez bien fait de ne pas rester sous le _Hussite_, commeje l'ai fait des heures et des nuits entieres. Vous eussiez vu etentendu la des choses qui vous eussent glacee d'effroi, et dont lesouvenir ne se fut jamais efface de votre memoire.--Taisez-vous, s'ecria la jeune baronne en tressaillant sur sa chaisecomme pour s'eloigner de la table ou s'appuyait Albert, je ne comprendspas l'insupportable amusement que vous vous donnez de me faire peur,chaque fois qu'il vous plait de desserrer les dents.--Plut au ciel, ma chere Amelie, dit le vieux Christian avec douceur,que ce fut en effet un amusement pour votre cousin de dire de pareilleschoses!--Non, mon pere, c'est tres-serieusement que je vous parle, reprit lecomte Albert. Le chene de la _pierre d'epouvante_ est renverse, fendu enquatre, et vous pouvez demain envoyer les bucherons pour le depecer; jeplanterai un cypres a la place, et je l'appellerai non plus le Hussite,mais le Penitent; et la pierre d'epouvante, il y a longtemps que vouseussiez du la nommer _pierre d'expiation_.--Assez, assez, mon fils, dit le vieillard avec une angoisse extreme.Eloignez de vous ces tristes images, et remettez-vous a Dieu du soin dejuger les actions des hommes.--Les tristes images ont disparu, mon pere; elles rentrent dans le neantavec ces instruments de supplice que le souffle de l'orage et le feu duciel viennent de coucher dans la poussiere. Je vois, a la place dessquelettes qui pendaient aux branches, des fleurs et des fruits que lezephyr balance aux rameaux d'une tige nouvelle. A la place de l'hommenoir qui chaque nuit rallumait le bucher, je vois une ame toute blancheet toute celeste qui plane sur ma tete et sur la votre. L'orage sedissipe, o mes chers parents! Le danger est passe, ceux qui voyagentsont a l'abri; mon ame est en paix. Le temps de l'expiation touche a safin. Je me sens renaitre.--Puisses-tu dire vrai, o mon fils bien-aime! repondit le vieuxChristian d'une voix emue et avec un accent de tendresse profonde;puisses-tu etre delivre des visions et des fantomes qui assiegent tonrepos! Dieu me ferait-il cette grace, de rendre a mon cher Albert lerepos, l'esperance, et la lumiere de la foi!"Avant que le vieillard eut acheve ces affectueuses paroles, Alberts'etait doucement incline sur la table, et paraissait tombe subitementdans un paisible sommeil."Qu'est-ce que cela signifie encore? dit la jeune baronne a son pere; levoila qui s'endort a table? c'est vraiment fort galant!--Ce sommeil soudain et profond, dit le chapelain en regardant le jeunehomme avec interet, est une crise favorable et qui me fait presager,pour quelque temps du moins, un heureux changement dans sa situation.--Que personne ne lui parle, dit le comte Christian, et ne cherche a letirer de cet assoupissement.--Seigneur misericordieux! dit la chanoinesse avec effusion en joignantles mains, faites que sa prediction constante se realise, et que le jourou il entre dans sa trentieme annee soit celui de sa guerisondefinitive!--Amen, ajouta le chapelain avec componction. Elevons tous nos coeursvers le Dieu de misericorde; et, en lui rendant graces de la nourritureque nous venons de prendre, supplions-le de nous accorder la delivrancede ce noble enfant, objet de toutes nos sollicitudes."On se leva pour reciter _les graces_, et chacun resta debout pendantquelques minutes, occupe a prier interieurement pour le dernier desRudolstadt. Le vieux Christian y mit tant de ferveur, que deux grosseslarmes coulerent sur ses joues fletries.Le vieillard venait de donner a ses fideles serviteurs l'ordred'emporter son fils dans son appartement, lorsque le baron Frederick,ayant cherche naivement dans sa cervelle par quel acte de devouement ilpourrait contribuer au bien-etre de son cher neveu, dit a son aine d'unair de satisfaction enfantine: "Il me vient une bonne idee, frere. Siton fils se reveille dans la solitude de son appartement, au milieu desa digestion, il peut lui venir encore quelques idees noires, par suitede quelques mauvais reves. Fais-le transporter dans le salon, et qu'onl'asseye sur mon grand fauteuil. C'est le meilleur de la maison pourdormir. Il y sera mieux que dans son lit; et quand il se reveillera, iltrouvera du moins un bon feu pour egayer ses regards, et des figuresamies pour rejouir son coeur.--Vous avez raison, mon frere, repondit Christian: on peut en effet letransporter au salon, et le coucher sur le grand sofa.--Il est tres-pernicieux de dormir etendu apres souper, s'ecria lebaron. Croyez-moi, frere, je sais cela par experience. Il faut luidonner mon fauteuil. Oui, je veux absolument qu'il ait mon fauteuil."Christian comprit que refuser l'offre de son frere serait lui faire unveritable chagrin. On installa donc le jeune comte dans le fauteuil decuir du vieux chasseur, sans qu'il s'apercut en aucune facon duderangement, tant son sommeil etait voisin de l'etat lethargique. Lebaron s'assit tout joyeux et tout fier sur un autre siege, se chauffantles tibias devant un feu digne des temps antiques, et souriant d'un airde triomphe chaque fois que le chapelain faisait la remarque que cesommeil du comte Albert devait avoir un heureux resultat. Le bonhomme sepromettait de sacrifier sa sieste aussi bien que son fauteuil, et des'associer au reste de sa famille pour veiller sur le jeune comte; mais,au bout d'un quart d'heure, il s'habitua si bien a son nouveau siege,qu'il se mit a ronfler sur un ton a couvrir les derniers grondements dutonnerre, qui se perdaient par degres dans l'eloignement.Le bruit de la grosse cloche du chateau (celle qu'on ne sonnait que pourles visites extraordinaires) se fit tout a coup entendre, et le vieuxHanz, le doyen des serviteurs de la maison, entra peu apres, tenant unegrande lettre qu'il presenta au comte Christian, sans dire une seuleparole. Puis il sortit pour attendre dans la salle voisine les ordres deson maitre; Christian ouvrit la lettre, et, ayant jete les yeux sur lasignature, presenta ce papier a la jeune baronne en la priant de lui enfaire la lecture. Amelie, curieuse et empressee, s'approcha d'unebougie, et lut tout haut ce qui suit:"Illustre et bien-aime seigneur comte,""Votre excellence me fait l'honneur de me demander un service. C'estm'en rendre un plus grand encore que tous ceux que j'ai recus d'elle, etdont mon coeur cherit et conserve le souvenir. Malgre mon empressement aexecuter ses ordres reveres, je n'esperais pas, cependant, trouver lapersonne qu'elle me demande aussi promptement et aussi convenablementque je desirais le faire. Mais des circonstances favorables venant acoincider d'une maniere imprevue avec les desirs de votre seigneurie, jem'empresse de lui envoyer une jeune personne qui remplit une partie desconditions imposees. Elle ne les remplit cependant pas toutes. Aussi, jene l'envoie que provisoirement, et pour donner a votre illustre etaimable niece le loisir d'attendre sans trop d'impatience un resultatplus complet de mes recherches et de mes demarches.""La personne qui aura l'honneur de vous remettre cette lettre est moneleve, et ma fille adoptive en quelque sorte; elle sera, ainsi que ledesire l'aimable baronne Amelie, a la fois une demoiselle de compagnieobligeante, et gracieuse, et une institutrice savante dans la musique.Elle n'a point, du reste, l'instruction que vous reclamez d'unegouvernante. Elle parle facilement plusieurs langues; mais elle ne lessait peut-etre pas assez correctement pour les enseigner. Elle possede afond la musique, et chante remarquablement bien. Vous serez satisfait deson talent, de sa voix et de son maintien. Vous ne le serez pas moins dela douceur et de la dignite de son caractere, et vos seigneuriespourront l'admettre dans leur intimite sans crainte de lui voir jamaiscommettre une inconvenance, ni donner la preuve d'un mauvais sentiment.Elle desire etre libre dans la mesure de ses devoirs envers votre noblefamille, et ne point recevoir d'honoraires. En un mot, ce n'est ni une_duegne_ ni une _suivante_ que j'adresse a l'aimable baronne, mais une_compagne_ et une _amie_, ainsi qu'elle m'a fait l'honneur de me ledemander dans le gracieux post-scriptum ajoute de sa belle main a lalettre de votre excellence.""Le seigneur Corner, nomme a l'ambassade d'Autriche, attend l'ordre deson depart. Mais il est a peu pres certain que cet ordre n'arrivera pasavant deux mois. La signora Corner, sa digne epouse et ma genereuseeleve, veut m'emmener, a Vienne, ou, selon elle, ma carriere doitprendre une face plus heureuse. Sans croire a un meilleur avenir, jecede a ses offres bienveillantes, avide que je suis de quitter l'ingrateVenise ou je n'ai eprouve que deceptions, affronts et revers de tousgenres. Il me tarde de revoir la noble Allemagne, ou j'ai connu desjours plus heureux et plus doux, et les amis venerables que j'y ailaisses. Votre seigneurie sait bien qu'elle occupe une des premieresplaces dans les souvenirs de ce vieux coeur froisse, mais non refroidi,qu'elle a rempli d'une eternelle affection et d'une profonde gratitude.C'est donc a vous, seigneur illustrissime, que je recommande et confiema fille adoptive, vous demandant pour elle hospitalite, protection etbenediction. Elle saura reconnaitre vos bontes par son zele a se rendreutile et agreable a la jeune baronne. Dans trois mois au plus j'irai lareprendre, et vous presenter a sa place une institutrice qui pourracontracter avec votre illustre famille de plus longs engagements.""En attendant ce jour fortune ou je presserai dans mes mains la main dumeilleur des hommes, j'ose me dire, avec respect et fierte, le plushumble des serviteurs et le plus devoue des amis de votre excellence_chiarissima, stimatissima, illustrissima_, etc."   "NICOLAS PORPORA.   Maitre de chapelle, compositeur et professeur de chant,   "Venise, le...., 17.."Amelie sauta de joie en achevant cette lettre, tandis que le vieux comterepetait a plusieurs reprises avec attendrissement: "Digne Porpora,excellent ami, homme respectable!--Certainement, certainement, dit la chanoinesse Wenceslawa, partageeentre la crainte de voir les habitudes de la famille derangees parl'arrivee d'une etrangere, et le desir d'exercer noblement les devoirsde l'hospitalite: il faudra la bien recevoir, la bien traiter ... Pourvuqu'elle ne s'ennuie pas ici!...--Mais, mon oncle, ou donc est ma future amie, ma precieuse maitresse?s'ecria la jeune baronne sans ecouter les reflexions de sa tante. Sansdoute elle va arriver bientot en personne?... Je l'attends avec uneimpatience ..."Le comte Christian sonna. "Hanz, dit-il au vieux serviteur, par quicette lettre vous a-t-elle ete remise?--Par une dame, monseigneur maitre.--Elle est deja ici? s'ecria Amelie. Ou donc, ou donc?--Dans sa chaise de poste, a l'entree du pont-levis.--Et vous l'avez laissee se morfondre a la porte du chateau, au lieu del'introduire tout de suite au salon?--Oui, madame la baronne, j'ai pris la lettre; j'ai defendu au postillonde mettre le pied hors de l'etrier, ni de quitter ses renes. J'ai faitrelever le pont derriere moi, et j'ai remis la lettre a monseigneurmaitre.--Mais c'est absurde, impardonnable, de faire attendre ainsi par lemauvais temps les hotes qui nous arrivent! Ne dirait-on pas que noussommes dans une forteresse, et que tous les gens qui en approchent sontdes ennemis! Courez donc, Hanz!"Hanz resta, immobile comme une statue. Ses yeux seuls exprimaient leregret de ne pouvoir obeir aux desirs de sa jeune maitresse; mais unboulet de canon passant sur sa tete n'eut pas derange d'une lignel'attitude impassible dans laquelle il attendait les ordres souverainsde son vieux maitre."Le fidele Hanz ne connait que son devoir et sa consigne, ma chereenfant, dit enfin le comte Christian avec une lenteur qui fit bouillirle sang de la baronne. Maintenant, Hanz, allez faire ouvrir la grille etbaisser le pont. Que tout le monde aille avec des flambeaux recevoir lavoyageuse; qu'elle soit ici la bienvenue!"Hanz ne montra pas la moindre surprise d'avoir a introduire d'emblee uneinconnue dans cette maison, ou les parents les plus proches et les amisles plus surs n'etaient jamais admis sans precautions et sans lenteurs.La chanoinesse alla donner des ordres pour le souper de l'etrangere.Amelie voulut courir au pont-levis; mais son oncle, tenant a honneurd'aller lui-meme a la rencontre de son hotesse, lui offrit son bras; etforce fut a l'impetueuse petite baronne de se trainer majestueusementjusqu'au peristyle, ou deja la chaise de poste venait de deposer sur lespremieres marches l'errante et fugitive Consuelo.XXIV.Depuis trois mois que la baronne Amelie s'etait mis en tete d'avoir unecompagne, pour l'instruire bien moins que pour dissiper l'ennui de sonisolement, elle avait fait cent fois dans son imagination le portrait desa future amie. Connaissant l'humeur chagrine du Porpora, elle avaitcraint qu'il ne lui envoyat une gouvernante austere et pedante. Aussiavait-elle ecrit en cachette au professeur pour lui annoncer qu'elleferait un tres mauvais accueil a toute gouvernante agee de plus devingt-cinq ans, comme s'il n'eut pas suffi qu'elle exprimat son desir ade vieux parents dont elle etait l'idole et la souveraine.En lisant la reponse du Porpora, elle fut si transportee, qu'elleimprovisa tout d'un trait dans sa tete une nouvelle image de lamusicienne, fille adoptive du professeur, jeune, et Venitienne surtout,c'est-a-dire, dans les idees d'Amelie, faite expres pour elle, a saguise et a sa ressemblance.Elle fut donc un peu deconcertee lorsqu'au lieu de l'espiegle enfantcouleur de rose qu'elle revait deja, elle vit une jeune personne pale,melancolique et tres interdite. Car au chagrin profond dont son pauvrecoeur etait accable, et a la fatigue d'un long et rapide voyage, uneimpression penible et presque mortelle etait venue se joindre dans l'amede Consuelo, au milieu de ces vastes forets de sapins battues parl'orage, au sein de cette nuit lugubre traversee de livides eclairs, etsurtout a l'aspect de ce sombre chateau, ou les hurlements de la meutedu baron et la lueur des torches que portaient les serviteursrepandaient quelque chose de vraiment sinistre. Quel contraste avec le_firmamento lucido_ de Marcello, le silence harmonieux des nuits deVenise, la liberte confiante de sa vie passee au sein de l'amour et dela riante poesie! Lorsque la voiture eut franchi lentement le pont-levisqui resonna sourdement sous les pieds des chevaux, et que la herseretomba derriere elle avec un affreux grincement, il lui sembla qu'elleentrait dans l'enfer du Dante, et saisie de terreur, elle recommanda soname a Dieu.Sa figure etait donc bouleversee lorsqu'elle se presenta devant seshotes; et celle du comte Christian venant a la frapper tout d'un coup,cette longue figure bleme, fletrie par l'age et le chagrin, et ce grandcorps maigre et raide sous son costume antique, elle crut voir lespectre d'un chatelain du moyen age; et, prenant tout ce qui l'entouraitpour une vision, elle recula en etouffant un cri d'effroi.Le vieux comte, n'attribuant son hesitation et sa paleur qu'al'engourdissement de la voiture et a la fatigue du voyage, lui offritson bras pour monter le perron, en essayant de lui adresser quelquesparoles d'interet et de politesse. Mais le digne homme, outre que lanature lui avait donne un exterieur froid et reserve, etait devenu,depuis plusieurs annees d'une retraite absolue, tellement etranger aumonde, que sa timidite avait redouble, et que, sous un aspect grave etsevere au premier abord, il cachait le trouble et la confusion d'unenfant. L'obligation qu'il s'imposa de parler italien (langue qu'ilavait sue passablement, mais dont il n'avait plus l'habitude) ajoutant ason embarras, il ne put que balbutier quelques paroles que Consueloentendit a peine, et qu'elle prit pour le langage inconnu et mysterieuxdes ombres.Amelie, qui s'etait promis de se jeter a son cou pour l'apprivoiser toutde suite, ne trouva rien a lui dire, ainsi qu'il arrive souvent parcontagion aux natures les plus entreprenantes, lorsque la timidited'autrui semble prete a reculer devant leurs prevenances.Consuelo fut introduite dans la grande salle ou l'on avait soupe. Lecomte, partage entre le desir de lui faire honneur, et la crainte de luimontrer son fils plonge dans un sommeil lethargique, s'arreta irresolu;et Consuelo, toute tremblante, sentant ses genoux flechir, se laissatomber sur le premier siege qui se trouva aupres d'elle."Mon oncle, dit Amelie qui comprenait l'embarras du vieux comte, jecrois que nous ferions bien de recevoir ici la signora. Il y fait pluschaud que dans le grand salon, et elle doit etre transie par ce ventd'orage si froid dans nos montagnes. Je vois avec chagrin qu'elle tombede fatigue, et je suis sure qu'elle a plus besoin d'un bon souper etd'un bon sommeil que de toutes nos ceremonies. N'est-il pas vrai, machere signora?" ajouta-t-elle en s'enhardissant jusqu'a presserdoucement de sa jolie main potelee le bras languissant de Consuelo.Le son de cette voix fraiche qui prononcait l'italien avec une rudesseallemande tres-franche, rassura Consuelo. Elle leva ses yeux voiles parla crainte sur le joli visage de la jeune baronne, et ce regard echangeentre elles rompit la glace aussitot. La voyageuse comprit tout de suiteque c'etait la son eleve, et que cette charmante tete n'etait pas celled'un fantome. Elle repondit a l'etreinte de sa main, confessa qu'elleetait tout etourdie du bruit de la voiture, et que l'orage l'avaitbeaucoup effrayee. Elle se preta a tous les soins qu'Amelie voulut luirendre, s'approcha du feu, se laissa debarrasser de son mantelet,accepta l'offre du souper quoiqu'elle n'eut pas faim le moins du monde,et, de plus en plus rassuree par l'amabilite croissante de sa jeunehotesse, elle retrouva enfin la faculte de voir, d'entendre et derepondre.Tandis que les domestiques servaient le souper, la conversations'engagea naturellement sur le Porpora. Consuelo fut heureuse d'entendrele vieux comte parler de lui comme de son ami, de son egal, et presquede son superieur. Puis on en revint a parler du voyage de Consuelo, dela route qu'elle avait tenue, et surtout de l'orage qui avait dul'epouvanter."Nous sommes habitues, a Venise, repondit Consuelo, a des tempetesencore plus soudaines, et beaucoup plus dangereuses; car dans nosgondoles, en traversant la ville, et jusqu'au seuil de nos maisons, nousrisquons de faire naufrage. L'eau, qui sert de pave a nos rues, grossitet s'agite comme les flots de la mer, et pousse nos barques fragiles lelong des murailles avec tant de violence, qu'elles peuvent s'y briseravant que nous ayons eu le temps d'aborder. Cependant, bien que j'aie vude pres de semblables accidents et que je ne sois pas tres peureuse,j'ai ete plus effrayee ce soir que je ne l'avais ete de ma vie, par lachute d'un grand arbre que la foudre a jete du haut de la montagne entravers de la route; les chevaux se sont cabres tout droits, et lepostillon s'est ecrie: _C'est l'arbre du malheur qui tombe; c'est leHussite!_ Ne pourriez-vous m'expliquer, _signora baronessa_, ce que celasignifie?"Ni le comte ni Amelie ne songerent a repondre a cette question. Ilsvenaient de tressaillir fortement en se regardant l'un l'autre."Mon fils ne s'etait donc pas trompe! dit le vieillard; etrange,etrange, en verite!"Et, ramene a sa sollicitude pour Albert, il sortit de la salle pouraller le rejoindre, tandis qu'Amelie murmurait en joignant les mains:"II y a ici de la magie, et le Diable demeure avec nous!"Ces bizarres propos ramenerent Consuelo au sentiment de terreursuperstitieuse qu'elle avait eprouve en entrant dans la demeure desRudolstadt. La subite paleur d'Amelie, le silence solennel de ces vieuxvalets a culottes rouges, a figures cramoisies, toutes semblables,toutes larges et carrees, avec ces yeux sans regards et sans vie quedonnent l'amour et l'eternite de la servitude; la profondeur de cettesalle, boisee de chene noir, ou la clarte d'un lustre charge de bougiesne suffisait pas a dissiper l'obscurite; les cris de l'effraie quirecommencait sa chasse apres l'orage autour du chateau; les grandsportraits de famille, les enormes tetes de cerf et de sanglier sculpteesen relief sur la boiserie, tout, jusqu'aux moindres circonstances,reveillait en elle les sinistres emotions qui venaient a peine de sedissiper. Les reflexions de la jeune baronne n'etaient pas de nature ala rassurer beaucoup."Ma chere signora, disait-elle en s'appretant a la servir, il faut vouspreparer a voir ici des choses inouies, inexplicables, fastidieuses leplus souvent, effrayantes parfois; de veritables scenes de roman, quepersonne ne voudrait croire si vous les racontiez, et que vous serezengagee sur l'honneur a ensevelir dans un eternel silence."Comme la baronne parlait ainsi, la porte s'ouvrit lentement, et lachanoinesse Wenceslawa, avec sa bosse, sa figure anguleuse et soncostume severe, rehausse du grand cordon de son ordre qu'elle nequittait jamais, entra de l'air le plus majestueusement affable qu'elleeut eu depuis le jour memorable ou l'imperatrice Marie-Therese, auretour de son voyage en Hongrie, avait fait au chateau des Geantsl'insigne honneur d'y prendre, avec sa suite, un verre d'hypocras et uneheure de repos. Elle s'avanca vers Consuelo, qui surprise et terrifiee,la regardait d'un oeil hagard sans songer a se lever, lui fit deuxreverences, et, apres un discours en allemand qu'elle semblait avoirappris par coeur longtemps d'avance, tant il etait compasse, s'approchad'elle pour l'embrasser au front. La pauvre enfant, plus froide qu'unmarbre, crut recevoir le baiser de la mort, et, prete a s'evanouir,murmura un remerciement inintelligible.Quand la chanoinesse eut passe dans le salon, car elle voyait bien quesa presence intimidait la voyageuse plus qu'elle ne l'avait desire,Amelie partit d'un grand eclat de rire."Vous avez cru, je gage, dit-elle a sa compagne, voir le spectre de lareine Libussa? Mais tranquillisez-vous. Cette bonne chanoinesse est matante, la plus ennuyeuse et la meilleure des femmes."A peine remise de cette emotion, Consuelo entendit craquer derriere ellede grosses bottes hongroises. Un pas lourd et mesure ebranla le pave, etune figure massive, rouge et carree au point que celles des grosserviteurs parurent pales et fines a cote d'elle, traversa la salle dansun profond silence, et sortit par la grande porte que les valets luiouvrirent respectueusement. Nouveau tressaillement de Consuelo, nouveaurire d'Amelie."Celui-ci, dit-elle, c'est le baron de Rudolstadt, le plus chasseur, leplus dormeur, et le plus tendre des peres. Il vient d'achever sa siesteau salon. A neuf heures sonnantes, il se leve de son fauteuil, sans pourcela se reveiller: il traverse cette salle sans rien voir et sans rienentendre, monte l'escalier, toujours endormi; se couche sans avoirconscience de rien, et s'eveille avec le jour, aussi dispos, aussialerte, et aussi actif qu'un jeune homme, pour aller preparer seschiens, ses chevaux et ses faucons pour la chasse."A peine avait-elle fini cette explication, que le chapelain vint apasser. Celui-la aussi etait gros, mais court et bleme comme unlymphatique. La vie contemplative ne convient pas a ces epaisses naturesslaves, et l'embonpoint du saint homme etait maladif. Il se contenta desaluer profondement les deux dames, parla bas a un domestique, etdisparut par le meme chemin que le baron avait pris. Aussitot, le vieuxHanz et un autre de ces automates que Consuelo ne pouvait distinguer lesuns des autres, tant ils appartenaient au meme type robuste et grave, sedirigerent vers le salon. Consuelo, ne trouvant plus la force de fairesemblant de manger, se retourna pour les suivre des yeux. Mais avantqu'ils eussent franchi la porte situee derriere elle, une nouvelleapparition plus saisissante que toutes les autres se presenta sur leseuil: c'etait un jeune homme d'une haute taille et d'une superbefigure, mais d'une paleur effrayante. Il etait vetu de noir de la teteaux pieds, et une riche pelisse de velours garnie de martre etaitretenue sur ses epaules par des brandebourgs et des agrafes d'or. Seslongs cheveux, noirs comme l'ebene, tombaient en desordre sur ses jouespales, un peu voilees par une barbe soyeuse qui bouclait naturellement.Il fit aux serviteurs qui s'etaient avances a sa rencontre un gesteimperatif, qui les forca de reculer et les tint immobiles a distance,comme si son regard les eut fascines. Puis, se retournant vers le comteChristian, qui venait derriere lui:"Je vous assure, mon pere, dit-il d'une voix harmonieuse et avecl'accent le plus noble, que je n'ai jamais ete aussi calme. Quelquechose de grand s'est accompli dans ma destinee, et la paix du ciel estdescendue sur notre maison.--Que Dieu t'entende, mon enfant!" repondit le vieillard en etendant lamain, comme pour le benir.Le jeune homme inclina profondement sa tete sous la main de son pere;puis, se redressant avec une expression douce et sereine, il s'avancajusqu'au milieu de la salle, sourit faiblement en touchant du bout desdoigts la main que lui tendait Amelie, et regarda fixement Consuelopendant quelques secondes. Frappee d'un respect involontaire, Consuelole salua en baissant les yeux. Mais il ne lui rendit pas son salut, etcontinua a la regarder."Cette jeune personne, lui dit la chanoinesse en allemand, c'est celleque ..."Mais il l'interrompit par un geste qui semblait dire: Ne me parlez pas,ne derangez pas le cours de mes pensees. Puis il se detourna sans donnerle moindre temoignage de surprise ou d'interet, et sortit lentement parla grande porte."Il faut, ma chere demoiselle, dit la chanoinesse, que vous excusiez....--Ma tante, je vous demande pardon de vous interrompre, dit Amelie; maisvous parlez allemand a la signora qui ne l'entend point.--Pardonnez-moi, bonne signora, repondit Consuelo en italien; j'ai parlebeaucoup de langues dans mon enfance, car j'ai beaucoup voyage; je mesouviens assez de l'allemand pour le comprendre parfaitement. Je n'osepas encore essayer de le prononcer; mais si vous voulez me donnerquelques lecons, j'espere m'y remettre dans peu de jours.--Vraiment, c'est comme moi, repartit la chanoinesse en allemand. Jecomprends tout ce que dit mademoiselle, et cependant je ne sauraisparler sa langue. Puisqu'elle m'entend, je lui dirai que mon neveu vientde faire, en ne la saluant pas, une impolitesse qu'elle voudra bienpardonner lorsqu'elle saura que ce jeune homme a ete ce soir fortementindispose ... et qu'apres son evanouissement il etait encore si faible,que sans doute il ne l'a point vue ... N'est-il pas vrai, mon frere?ajouta la bonne Wenceslawa, toute troublee des mensonges qu'elle venaitde faire, et cherchant son excuse dans les yeux du comte Christian.--Ma chere soeur, repondit le vieillard, vous etes genereuse d'excusermon fils. La signora voudra bien ne pas trop s'etonner de certaineschoses que nous lui apprendrons demain a coeur ouvert, avec la confianceque doit nous inspirer la fille adoptive du Porpora, j'espere direbientot l'amie de notre famille."C'etait l'heure ou chacun se retirait, et la maison etait soumise a deshabitudes si regulieres, que si les deux jeunes filles fussent resteesplus longtemps a table, les serviteurs, comme de veritables machines,eussent emporte, je crois, leurs sieges et souffle les bougies sanstenir compte de leur presence. D'ailleurs il tardait a Consuelo de seretirer; et Amelie la conduisit a la chambre elegante et confortablequ'elle lui avait fait reserver tout a cote de la sienne propre."J'aurais bien envie de causer avec vous une heure ou deux, lui dit-elleaussitot que la chanoinesse, qui avait fait gravement les honneurs del'appartement, se fut retiree. Il me tarde de vous mettre au courant detout ce qui se passe ici, avant que vous ayez a supporter nosbizarreries. Mais vous etes si fatiguee que vous devez desirer avanttout de vous reposer.--Qu'a cela ne tienne, signora, repondit Consuelo. J'ai les membresbrises, il est vrai; mais j'ai la tete si echauffee, que je suis biencertaine de ne pas dormir de la nuit. Ainsi parlez-moi tant que vousvoudrez; mais a condition que ce sera en allemand, cela me servira delecon; car je vois que l'italien n'est pas familier au seigneur comte,et encore moins a madame la chanoinesse.--Faisons un accord, dit Amelie. Vous allez vous mettre au lit pourreposer vos pauvres membres brises. Pendant ce temps, j'irai passer unerobe de nuit et congedier ma femme de chambre. Je reviendrai apresm'asseoir a votre chevet, et nous parlerons allemand jusqu'a ce que lesommeil nous vienne. Est-ce convenu?--De tout mon coeur, repondit la nouvelle gouvernante.XXV."Sachez donc, ma chere ... dit Amelie lorsqu'elle eut fait sesarrangements pour la conversation projetee. Mais je m'apercois que je nesais point votre nom, ajouta-t-elle en souriant. Il serait temps desupprimer entre nous les titres et les ceremonies. Je veux que vousm'appeliez desormais Amelie, comme je veux vous appeler ...--J'ai un nom etranger, difficile a prononcer, repondit Consuelo.L'excellent maitre Porpora, en m'envoyant ici, m'a ordonne de prendre lesien, comme c'est l'usage des protecteurs ou des maitres envers leurseleves privilegies; je partage donc desormais, avec le grand chanteurHuber (dit le Porporino), l'honneur de me nommer la Porporina; mais parabreviation vous m'appellerez, si vous voulez tout simplement _Nina_.--Va pour Nina, entre nous, reprit Amelie. Maintenant ecoutez-moi, carj'ai une assez longue histoire a vous raconter, et si je ne remonte unpeu haut dans le passe, vous ne pourrez jamais comprendre ce qui sepasse aujourd'hui dans cette maison.--Je suis toute attention et toute oreilles, dit la nouvelle Porporina.--Vous n'etes pas, ma chere Nina, sans connaitre un peu l'histoire de laBoheme? dit la jeune baronne.--Helas, repondit Consuelo, ainsi que mon maitre a du vous l'ecrire, jesuis tout a fait depourvue d'instruction; je connais tout au plus un peul'histoire de la musique; mais celle de la Boheme, je ne la connais pasplus que celle d'aucun pays du monde.--En ce cas, reprit Amelie, je vais vous en dire succinctement ce qu'ilvous importe d'en savoir pour l'intelligence de mon recit. Il y a troiscents ans et plus, le peuple opprime et efface au milieu duquel vousvoici transplantee etait un grand peuple, audacieux, indomptable,heroique. Il avait des lors, a la verite, des maitres etrangers, unereligion qu'il ne comprenait pas bien et qu'on voulait lui imposer deforce. Des moines innombrables le pressuraient; un roi cruel et debauchese jouait de sa dignite et froissait toutes ses sympathies. Mais unefureur secrete, une haine profonde, fermentaient de plus en plus, et unjour l'orage eclata: les maitres etrangers furent chasses, la religionfut reformee, les couvents pilles et rases, l'ivrogne Wenceslas jete enprison et depouille de sa couronne. Le signal de la revolte avait ete lesupplice de Jean Huss et de Jerome de Prague, deux savants courageux deBoheme qui voulaient examiner et eclaircir le mystere du catholicisme,et qu'un concile appela, condamna et fit bruler, apres leur avoir promisla vie sauve et la liberte de la discussion. Cette trahison et cetteinfamie furent si sensibles a l'honneur national, que la guerreensanglanta la Boheme et une grande partie de l'Allemagne, pendant delongues annees. Cette guerre d'extermination fut appelee la guerre desHussites. Des crimes odieux et innombrables y furent commis de part etd'autre. Les moeurs du temps etaient farouches et impitoyables sur toutela face de la terre. L'esprit de parti et le fanatisme religieux lesrendirent plus terribles encore, et la Boheme fut l'epouvante del'Europe. Je n'effraierai pas votre imagination, deja emue, de l'aspectde ce pays sauvage, par le recit des scenes effroyables qui s'ypasserent. Ce ne sont, d'une part, que meurtres, incendies, pestes,buchers, destructions, eglises profanees, moines et religieux mutiles,pendus, jetes dans la poix bouillante; de l'autre, que villes detruites,pays desoles, trahisons, mensonges, cruautes, hussites jetes parmilliers dans les mines, comblant des abimes de leurs cadavres, etjonchant la terre de leurs ossements et de ceux de leurs ennemis. Cesaffreux Hussites furent longtemps invincibles; aujourd'hui nous neprononcons leur nom qu'avec effroi: et cependant leur patriotisme, leurconstance intrepide et leurs exploits fabuleux laissent en nous unsecret sentiment d'admiration et d'orgueil que de jeunes esprits commele mien ont parfois de la peine a dissimuler.--Et pourquoi dissimuler? demanda Consuelo naivement.--C'est que la Boheme est retombee, apres bien des luttes, sous le jougde l'esclavage; c'est qu'il n'y a plus de Boheme, ma pauvre Nina. Nosmaitres savaient bien que la liberte religieuse de notre pays, c'etaitsa liberte politique. Voila pourquoi ils ont etouffe l'une et l'autre.--Voyez, reprit Consuelo, combien je suis ignorante! Je n'avais jamaisentendu parler de ces choses, et je ne savais pas que les hommes eussentete si malheureux et si mechants.--Cent ans apres Jean Huss, un nouveau savant, un nouveau sectaire, unpauvre moine, appele Martin Luther, vint reveiller l'esprit national, etinspirer a la Boheme et a toutes les provinces independantes del'Allemagne la haine du joug etranger et la revolte contre les papes.Les plus puissants rois demeurerent catholiques, non pas tant par amourde la religion que par amour du pouvoir absolu. L'Autriche s'unit a nouspour nous accabler, et une nouvelle guerre, appelee la guerre de trenteans, vint ebranler et detruire notre nationalite. Des le commencement decette guerre, la Boheme fut la proie du plus fort; l'Autriche noustraita en vaincus, nous ota notre foi, notre liberte, notre langue, etjusqu'a notre nom. Nos peres resisterent courageusement, mais le jougimperial s'est de plus en plus appesanti sur nous. Il y a cent vingt ansque notre noblesse, ruinee et decimee par les exactions, les combats etles supplices, a ete forcee de s'expatrier ou de se denationaliser, enabjurant ses origines, en germanisant ses noms (faites attention a ceci)et en renoncant a la liberte de ses croyances religieuses. On a brulenos livres, on a detruit nos ecoles, on nous a faits Autrichiens en unmot. Nous ne sommes plus qu'une province de l'Empire, et vous entendezparler allemand dans un pays slave; c'est vous en dire assez.--Et maintenant, vous souffrez de cet esclavage et vous en rougissez? Jele comprends, et je hais deja l'Autriche de tout mon coeur.--Oh! parlez plus bas! s'ecria la jeune baronne. Nul ne peut parlerainsi sans danger, sous le ciel noir de la Boheme; et dans ce chateau,il n'y a qu'une seule personne qui ait l'audace et la folie de dire ceque vous venez de dire, ma chere Nina! C'est mon cousin Albert.--Voila donc la cause du chagrin qu'on lit sur son visage? Je me suissentie saisie de respect en le regardant.--Ah! ma belle lionne de Saint-Marc! dit Amelie, surprise de l'animationgenereuse qui tout a coup fit resplendir le pale visage de sa compagne;vous prenez les choses trop au serieux. Je crains bien que dans peu dejours mon pauvre cousin ne vous inspire plus de pitie que de respect.--L'un pourrait bien ne pas empecher l'autre, reprit Consuelo; maisexpliquez-vous, chere baronne.--Ecoutez bien, dit Amelie. Nous sommes une famille tres-catholique,tres-fidele a l'eglise et a l'empire. Nous portons un nom saxon, et nosancetres de la branche saxonne furent toujours tres-orthodoxes. Si matante la chanoinesse entreprend un jour, pour votre malheur, de vousraconter les services que nos aieux les comtes et les barons allemandsont rendus a la sainte cause, vous verrez qu'il n'y a pas, selon elle,la plus petite tache d'heresie sur notre ecusson. Meme au temps ou laSaxe etait protestante, les Rudolstadt aimerent mieux abandonner leurselecteurs protestants que le giron de l'eglise romaine. Mais ma tante nes'avisera jamais de vanter ces choses-la en presence du comte Albert,sans quoi vous entendriez dire a celui-ci les choses les plussurprenantes que jamais oreilles humaines aient entendues.--Vous piquez toujours ma curiosite sans la satisfaire. Je comprendsjusqu'ici que je ne dois pas avoir l'air, devant vos nobles parents, departager vos sympathies et celle du comte Albert pour la vieille Boheme.Vous pouvez, chere baronne, vous en rapporter a ma prudence. D'ailleursje suis nee en pays catholique, et le respect que j'ai pour ma religion,autant que celui que je dois a votre famille, suffiraient pour m'imposersilence en toute occasion.--Ce sera prudent; car je vous avertis encore une fois que nous sommesterriblement collets-montes a cet endroit-la. Quant a moi, enparticulier, chere Nina, je suis de meilleure composition. Je ne suis niprotestante ni catholique. J'ai ete elevee par des religieuses; leurssermons et leurs patenotres m'ont ennuyee considerablement. Le memeennui me poursuit jusqu'ici, et ma tante Wenceslawa resume en elle seulele pedantisme et les superstitions de toute une communaute. Mais je suistrop de mon siecle pour me jeter par reaction dans les controverses nonmoins assommantes des lutheriens: et quant aux hussites, c'est del'histoire si ancienne, que je n'en suis guere plus engouee que de lagloire des Grecs ou des Romains. L'esprit francais est mon ideal, et jene crois pas qu'il y ait d'autre raison, d'autre philosophie et d'autrecivilisation que celle que l'on pratique dans cet aimable et riant paysde France, dont je lis quelquefois les ecrits en cachette, et dontj'apercois le bonheur, la liberte et les plaisirs de loin, comme dans unreve a travers les fentes de ma prison.--Vous me surprenez a chaque instant davantage, dit Consuelo avecsimplicite. D'ou vient donc que tout a l'heure vous me sembliez pleined'heroisme en rappelant les exploits de vos antiques Bohemiens? Je vousai crue Bohemienne et quelque peu heretique.--Je suis plus qu'heretique, et plus que Bohemienne, repondit Amelie enriant, je suis un peu incredule, et tout a fait rebelle. Je hais touteespece de domination, qu'elle soit spirituelle ou temporelle, et jeproteste tout bas contre l'Autriche, qui de toutes les duegnes est laplus guindee et la plus devote.--Et le comte Albert est-il incredule de la meme maniere? A-t-il aussil'esprit francais? Vous devez, en ce cas, vous entendre a merveille?--Oh! nous ne nous entendons pas le moins du monde, et voici, enfin,apres tous mes preambules necessaires, le moment de vous parler de lui:"Le comte Christian, mon oncle, n'eut pas d'enfants de sa premierefemme. Remarie a l'age de quarante ans, il eut de la seconde cinq filsqui moururent tous, ainsi que leur mere, de la meme maladie nee aveceux, une douleur continuelle et une sorte de fievre dans le cerveau.Cette seconde femme etait de pur sang boheme et avait, dit-on, unegrande beaute et beaucoup d'esprit. Je ne l'ai pas connue. Vous verrezson portrait, en corset de pierreries et en manteau d'ecarlate, dans legrand salon. Albert lui ressemble prodigieusement. C'est le sixieme etle dernier de ses enfants, le seul qui ait atteint l'age de trente ans;et ce n'est pas sans peine: car, sans etre malade en apparence, il apasse par de rudes epreuves, et d'etranges symptomes de maladie ducerveau donnent encore a craindre pour ses jours. Entre nous, je necrois pas qu'il depasse de beaucoup ce terme fatal que sa mere n'a pufranchir. Quoiqu'il fut ne d'un pere deja avance en age, Albert est douepourtant d'une forte constitution; mais, comme il le dit lui-meme, lemal est dans son ame, et ce mal a ete toujours en augmentant. Des sapremiere enfance, il eut l'esprit frappe d'idees bizarres etsuperstitieuses. A l'age de quatre ans, il pretendait voir souvent samere aupres de son berceau, bien qu'elle fut morte et qu'il l'eut vuensevelir. La nuit il s'eveillait pour lui repondre; et ma tanteWenceslawa en fut parfois si effrayee, qu'elle faisait toujours coucherplusieurs femmes dans sa chambre aupres de l'enfant, tandis que lechapelain usait je ne sais combien d'eau benite pour exorciser lefantome, et disait des messes par douzaines pour l'obliger a se tenirtranquille. Mais rien n'y fit; car l'enfant n'ayant plus parle de cesapparitions pendant bien longtemps, il avoua pourtant un jour enconfidence a sa nourrice qu'il voyait toujours _sa petite mere_, maisqu'il ne voulait plus le raconter, parce que monsieur le chapelaindisait ensuite dans la chambre de mechantes paroles pour l'empecher derevenir."C'etait un enfant sombre et taciturne. On s'efforcait de le distraire,on l'accablait de jouets et de divertissements qui ne servirent pendantlongtemps qu'a l'attrister davantage. Enfin on prit le parti de ne pascontrarier le gout qu'il montrait pour l'etude, et en effet, cettepassion satisfaite lui donna plus d'animation; mais cela ne fit quechanger sa melancolie calme et languissante en une exaltation bizarre,melee d'acces de chagrin dont les causes etaient impossibles a prevoiret a detourner. Par exemple, lorsqu'il voyait des pauvres, il fondait enlarmes, et se depouillait de toutes ses petites richesses, se reprochantet s'affligeant toujours de ne pouvoir leur donner assez. S'il voyaitbattre un enfant, ou rudoyer un paysan, il entrait dans de tellesindignations, qu'il tombait ou evanoui, ou en convulsion pour des heuresentieres. Tout cela annoncait un bon naturel et un grand coeur; mais lesmeilleures qualites poussees a l'exces deviennent des defauts ou desridicules. La raison ne se developpait point dans le jeune Albert enmeme temps que le sentiment et l'imagination. L'etude de l'histoire lepassionnait sans l'eclairer. Il etait toujours, en apprenant les crimeset les injustices des hommes, agite d'emotions par trop naives, comme ceroi barbare qui, en ecoutant la lecture de la passion de Notre-Seigneur,s'ecriait en brandissant sa lance: "Ah! si j'avais ete la avec meshommes d'armes, de telles choses ne seraient pas arrivees! j'auraishache ces mechants Juifs en mille pieces!""Albert ne pouvait pas accepter les hommes pour ce qu'ils ont ete etpour ce qu'ils sont encore. Il trouvait le ciel injuste de ne les avoirpas crees tous bons et compatissants comme lui; et a force de tendresseet de vertu, il ne s'apercevait pas qu'il devenait impie et misanthrope.Il ne comprenait que ce qu'il eprouvait, et, a dix-huit ans, il etaitaussi incapable de vivre avec les hommes et de jouer dans la societe lerole que sa position exigeait, que s'il n'eut eu que six mois. Siquelqu'un emettait devant lui une de ces pensees d'egoisme dont notrepauvre monde fourmille et sans lequel il n'existerait pas, sans sesoucier de la qualite de cette personne, ni des egards que sa famillepouvait lui devoir, il lui montrait sur-le-champ un eloignementinvincible, et rien ne l'eut decide a lui faire le moindre accueil. Ilfaisait sa societe des etres les plus vulgaires et les plus disgraciesde la fortune et meme de la nature. Dans les jeux de son enfance, il nese plaisait qu'avec les enfants des pauvres, et surtout avec ceux dontla stupidite ou les infirmites n'eussent inspire a tout autre quel'ennui et le degout. Il n'a pas perdu ce singulier penchant, et vous neserez pas longtemps ici sans en avoir la preuve."Comme, au milieu de ces bizarreries, il montrait beaucoup d'esprit, dememoire et d'aptitude pour les beaux-arts, son pere et sa bonne tanteWenceslawa, qui l'elevaient avec amour, n'avaient point sujet de rougirde lui dans le monde. On attribuait ses ingenuites a un peu desauvagerie, contractee dans les habitudes de la campagne; et lorsqu'iletait dispose a les pousser trop loin, on avait soin de le cacher, sousquelque pretexte, aux personnes qui auraient pu s'en offenser. Mais,malgre ses admirables qualites et ses heureuses dispositions, le comteet la chanoinesse voyaient avec effroi cette nature independante etinsensible a beaucoup d'egards, se refuser de plus en plus aux lois dela bienseance et aux usages du monde.--Mais jusqu'ici, interrompit Consuelo je ne vois rien qui prouve cettederaison dont vous parlez.--C'est que vous etes vous-meme, a ce que je pense, repondit Amelie, unebelle ame tout a fait candide.... Mais peut-etre etes-vous fatiguee dem'entendre babiller, et voulez-vous essayer de vous endormir.--Nullement, chere baronne, je vous supplie de continuer, reponditConsuelo."Amelie reprit son recit en ces termes :XXVI."Vous dites, chere Nina, que vous ne voyez jusqu'ici aucune extravagancedans les faits et gestes de mon pauvre cousin. Je vais vous en donner demeilleures preuves. Mon oncle et ma tante sont, a coup sur, lesmeilleurs chretiens et les ames les plus charitables qu'il y ait aumonde. Ils ont toujours repandu les aumones autour d'eux a pleinesmains, et il est impossible de mettre moins de faste et d'orgueil dansl'emploi des richesses que ne le font ces dignes parents. Eh bien, moncousin trouvait leur maniere de vivre tout a fait contraire a l'espritevangelique. Il eut voulu qu'a l'exemple des premiers chretiens, ilsvendissent leurs biens, et se fissent mendiants, apres les avoirdistribues aux pauvres. S'il ne disait pas cela precisement, retenu parle respect et l'amour qu'il leur portait, il faisait bien voir que telleetait sa pensee, en plaignant avec amertume le sort des miserables quine font que souffrir et travailler, tandis que les riches vivent dans lebien-etre et l'oisivete. Quand il avait donne tout l'argent qu'on luipermettait de depenser, ce n'etait, selon lui, qu'une goutte d'eau dansla mer; et il demandait d'autres sommes plus considerables, qu'onn'osait trop lui refuser, et qui s'ecoulaient comme de l'eau entre sesmains. Il en a tant donne, que vous ne verrez pas un indigent dans lepays qui nous environne; et je dois dire que nous ne nous en trouvonspas mieux: car les exigences des petits et leurs besoins augmentent enraison des concessions qu'on leur fait, et nos bons paysans, jadis sihumbles et si doux, levent beaucoup la tete, grace aux prodigalites etaux beaux discours de leur jeune maitre. Si nous n'avions la forceimperiale au-dessus de nous tous, pour nous proteger d'une part, tandisqu'elle nous opprime de l'autre, je crois que nos terres et nos chateauxeussent ete pilles et devastes vingt fois par les bandes de paysans desdistricts voisins que la guerre a affames, et que l'inepuisable pitied'Albert (celebre a trente lieues a la ronde) nous a mis sur le dos,surtout dans ces dernieres affaires de la succession de l'empereurCharles.""Lorsque le comte Christian voulait faire au jeune Albert quelques sagesremontrances, lui disant que donner tout dans un jour, c'etait s'oter lemoyen de donner le lendemain:--Eh quoi, mon pere bien-aime, lui repondait-il, n'avons-nous pas, pournous abriter, un toit qui durera plus que nous, tandis que des milliersd'infortunes n'ont que le ciel inclement et froid sur leurs tetes?N'avons-nous pas chacun plus d'habits qu'il n'en faudrait pour vetir unede ces familles couvertes de haillons? Ne vois-je point sur notre table,chaque jour, plus de viandes et de bons vins de Hongrie qu'il n'enfaudrait pour rassasier et reconforter ces mendiants epuises de besoinet de lassitude? Avons-nous le droit de refuser quelque chose tant quenous avons au dela du necessaire? Et le necessaire meme, nous est-ilpermis d'en user quand les autres ne l'ont pas? La loi du Christa-t-elle change?"Que pouvaient repondre a de si belles paroles le comte, et lachanoinesse, et le chapelain, qui avaient eleve ce jeune homme dans desprincipes de religion si fervents et si austeres? Aussi setrouvaient-ils bien embarrasses en le voyant prendre ainsi les choses aupied de la lettre, et ne vouloir accepter aucune de ces transactionsavec le siecle, sur lesquelles repose pourtant, ce me semble, toutl'edifice des societes."C'etait bien autre chose quand il s'agissait de politique. Alberttrouvait monstrueuses ces lois humaines qui autorisent les souverains afaire tuer des millions d'hommes, et a ruiner des contrees immenses,pour les caprices de leur orgueil et les interets de leur vanite. Sonintolerance sur ce point devenait dangereuse, et ses parents n'osaientplus le mener a Vienne, ni a Prague, ni dans aucune grande ville, ou sonfanatisme de vertu leur eut fait de mauvaises affaires. Ils n'etaientpas plus rassures a l'endroit de ses principes religieux; car il yavait, dans sa piete exaltee, tout ce qu'il faut pour faire un heretiquea pendre et a bruler. Il haissait les papes, ces apotres de Jesus-Christqui se liguent avec les rois contre le repos et la dignite des peuples.Il blamait le luxe des eveques et l'esprit mondain des abbes, etl'ambition de tous les hommes d'eglise. Il faisait au pauvre chapelaindes sermons renouveles de Luther et de Jean Huss; et cependant Albertpassait des heures entieres prosterne sur le pave des chapelles, plongedans des meditations et des extases dignes d'un saint. Il observait lesjeunes et les abstinences bien au dela des prescriptions de l'Eglise; ondit meme qu'il portait un cilice, et qu'il fallut toute l'autorite deson pere et toute la tendresse de sa tante pour le faire renoncer a cesmacerations qui ne contribuaient pas peu a exalter sa pauvre tete."Quand ces bons et sages parents virent qu'il etait en chemin dedissiper tout son patrimoine en peu d'annees, et de se faire jeter enprison comme rebelle a la Sainte-Eglise et au Saint-Empire, ils prirentenfin, avec douleur, le parti de le faire voyager, esperant qu'a forcede voir les hommes et leurs lois fondamentales, a peu pres les memesdans tout le monde civilise, il s'habituerait a vivre comme eux et aveceux. Ils le confierent donc a un gouverneur, fin jesuite, homme du mondeet homme d'esprit s'il en fut, qui comprit son role a demi-mot, et sechargea, dans sa conscience, de prendre sur lui tout ce qu'on n'osaitpas lui demander. Pour parler clair, il s'agissait de corrompre etd'emousser cette ame farouche, de la faconner au joug social, en luiinfusant goutte a goutte les poisons si doux et si necessaires del'ambition, de la vanite, de l'indifference religieuse, politique etmorale.--Ne froncez pas ainsi le sourcil en m'ecoutant, chere Porporina.Mon digne oncle est un homme simple et bon, qui des sa jeunesse, aaccepte toutes ces choses, telles qu'on les lui a donnees, et qui a su,dans tout le cours de sa vie, concilier, sans hypocrisie et sans examen,la tolerance et la religion, les devoirs du chretien et ceux du grandseigneur. Dans un monde et dans un siecle ou l'on trouve un homme commeAlbert sur des millions comme nous autres, celui qui marche avec lesiecle et le monde est sage, et celui qui veut remonter de deux milleans dans le passe est un fou qui scandalise ses pareils et ne convertitpersonne."Albert a voyage pendant huit ans. Il a vu l'Italie, la France,l'Angleterre, la Prusse, la Pologne, la Russie, les Turcs meme; il estrevenu par la Hongrie, l'Allemagne meridionale et la Baviere. Il s'estconduit sagement durant ces longues excursions, ne depensant point audela du revenu honorable que ses parents lui avaient assigne, leurecrivant des lettres fort douces et tres affectueuses, ou il ne parlaitjamais que des choses qui avaient frappe ses yeux, sans faire aucunereflexion approfondie sur quoi que ce fut, et sans donner a l'abbe, songouverneur, aucun sujet de plainte ou d'ingratitude."Revenu ici au commencement de l'annee derniere, apres les premiersembrassements, il se retira, dit-on, dans la chambre qu'avait habitee samere, y resta enferme pendant plusieurs heures, et en sortit fort pale,pour s'en aller promener seul sur la montagne."Pendant ce temps, l'abbe parla en confidence a la chanoinesseWenceslawa et au chapelain, qui avaient exige de lui une completesincerite sur l'etat physique et moral du jeune comte. Le comte Albert,leur dit-il, soit que l'effet du voyage l'ait subitement metamorphose,soit que, d'apres ce que vos seigneuries m'avaient raconte de sonenfance, je me fusse fait une fausse idee de lui, le comte Albert,dis-je, s'est montre a moi, des le premier jour de notre association,tel que vous le verrez aujourd'hui, doux, calme, longanime, patient, etd'une exquise politesse. Cette excellente maniere d'etre ne s'est pasdementie un seul instant, et je serais le plus injuste des hommes si jeformulais la moindre plainte contre lui. Rien de ce que je craignais deses folles depenses, de ses brusqueries, de ses declamations, de sonascetisme exalte, n'est arrive. Il ne m'a pas demande une seule fois aadministrer par lui-meme la petite fortune que vous m'aviez confiee, etn'a jamais exprime le moindre mecontentement. Il est vrai que j'aitoujours prevenu ses desirs, et que, lorsque je voyais un pauvres'approcher de sa voiture, je me hatais de le renvoyer satisfait avantqu'il eut tendu la main. Cette facon d'agir a completement reussi, et jepuis dire que le spectacle de la misere et des infirmites n'ayantpresque plus attriste les regards de sa seigneurie, elle ne m'a passemble une seule fois se rappeler ses anciennes preoccupations sur cepoint. Jamais je ne l'ai entendu gronder personne, ni blamer aucunusage, ni porter un jugement defavorable sur aucune institution. Cettedevotion ardente, dont vous redoutiez l'exces, a semble faire place aune regularite de conduite et de pratiques tout a fait convenables a unhomme du monde. Il a vu les plus brillantes cours de l'Europe, et lesplus nobles compagnies sans paraitre ni enivre ni scandalise d'aucunechose. Partout on a remarque sa belle figure, son noble maintien, sapolitesse sans emphase, et le bon gout qui presidait aux paroles qu'il asu dire toujours a propos. Ses moeurs sont demeurees aussi pures quecelles d'une jeune fille parfaitement elevee, sans qu'il ait montreaucune pruderie de mauvais ton. Il a vu les theatres, les musees et lesmonuments; il a parle sobrement et judicieusement sur les arts. Enfin,je ne concois en aucune facon l'inquietude qu'il avait donnee a vosseigneuries, n'ayant jamais vu, pour ma part, d'homme plus raisonnable.S'il y a quelque chose d'extraordinaire en lui, c'est precisement cettemesure, cette prudence, ce sang-froid, cette absence d'entrainements etde passions que je n'ai jamais rencontres dans un jeune homme aussiavantageusement pourvu par la nature, la naissance, et la fortune."Ceci n'etait, au reste, que la confirmation des frequentes lettres quel'abbe avait ecrites a la famille; mais on avait toujours craint quelqueexageration de sa part, et l'on n'etait vraiment tranquille que de cemoment ou il affirmait la guerison morale de mon cousin, sans crainted'etre dementi par la conduite qu'il tiendrait sous les yeux de sesparents. On accabla l'abbe de presents et de caresses, et l'on attenditavec impatience qu'Albert fut rentre de sa promenade. Elle duralongtemps, et, lorsqu'il vint enfin se mettre a table a l'heure dusouper, on fut frappe de la paleur et de la gravite de sa physionomie.Dans le premier moment d'effusion, ses traits avaient exprime unesatisfaction douce et profonde qu'on n'y retrouvait deja plus. On s'enetonna, et on en parla tout bas a l'abbe avec inquietude. Il regardaAlbert, et se retournant avec surprise vers ceux qui l'interrogeaientdans un coin de l'appartement:"--Je ne trouve rien d'extraordinaire dans la figure de monsieur lecomte, repondit-il; il a l'expression digne et paisible quo je lui aivue depuis huit ans que j'ai l'honneur de l'accompagner."Le comte Christian se paya de cette reponse."--Nous l'avons quitte encore pare des roses de l'adolescence, dit-il asa soeur, et souvent, helas! en proie a une sorte de fievre interieurequi faisait eclater sa voix et briller ses regards; nous le retrouvonsbruni par le soleil des contrees meridionales, un peu creuse par lafatigue peut-etre, et de plus entoure de la gravite qui convient a unhomme fait. Ne trouvez-vous pas, ma chere soeur, qu'il est mieux ainsi?"--Je lui trouve l'air bien triste sous cette gravite, repondit ma bonnetante, et je n'ai jamais vu un homme de vingt-huit ans aussi flegmatiqueet aussi peu discoureur. Il nous repond par monosyllabes."--Monsieur le comte a toujours ete fort sobre de paroles, reponditl'abbe."--Il n'etait point ainsi autrefois, dit la chanoinesse. S'il avait dessemaines de silence et de meditation, il avait des jours d'expansion etdes heures d'eloquence."--Je ne l'ai jamais vu se departir, reprit l'abbe, de la reserve quevotre seigneurie remarque en ce moment."--L'aimiez-vous donc mieux alors qu'il parlait trop, et disait deschoses qui nous faisaient trembler? dit le comte Christian a sa soeuralarmee; voila bien les femmes!"--Mais il existait, dit-elle, et maintenant il a l'air d'un habitant del'autre monde, qui ne prend aucune part aux affaires de celui-ci."--C'est le caractere constant de monsieur le comte, repondit l'abbe;c'est un homme concentre, qui ne fait part a personne de sesimpressions, et qui, si je dois dire toute ma pensee, ne s'impressionnede presque rien d'exterieur. C'est le fait des personnes froides,sensees, reflechies. Il est ainsi fait, et je crois qu'en cherchant al'exciter, on ne ferait que porter le trouble dans cette ame ennemie del'action et de toute initiative dangereuse.--Oh! je fais serment que ce n'est pas la son vrai caractere! s'ecria lachanoinesse.--Madame la chanoinesse reviendra des preventions qu'elle se formecontre un si rare avantage.--En effet, ma soeur, dit le comte, je trouve que monsieur l'abbe parlefort sagement. N'a-t-il pas obtenu par ses soins et sa condescendance leresultat que nous avons tant desire? N'a-t-il pas detourne les malheursque nous redoutions? Albert s'annoncait comme un prodigue, unenthousiaste, un temeraire. Il nous revient tel qu'il doit etre pourmeriter l'estime, la confiance et la consideration de ses semblables.--Mais efface comme un vieux livre, dit la chanoinesse, ou peut-etreraidi contre toutes choses, et dedaigneux de tout ce qui ne repond pas ases secrets instincts. Il ne semble point heureux de nous revoir, nousqui l'attendions avec tant d'impatience!--Monsieur le comte etait impatient lui-meme de revenir, reprit l'abbe;je le voyais, bien qu'il ne le manifestat pas ouvertement. Il est si peudemonstratif! La nature l'a fait recueilli.--La nature l'a fait demonstratif, au contraire, repliqua-t-ellevivement. Il etait quelquefois violent, et quelquefois tendre a l'exces.Il me fachait souvent, mais il se jetait dans mes bras, et j'etaisdesarmee."--Avec moi, dit l'abbe, il n'a jamais eu rien a reparer."--Croyez-moi, ma soeur, c'est beaucoup mieux ainsi, dit mon oncle...."--Helas! dit la chanoinesse, il aura donc toujours ce visage qui meconsterne et me serre le coeur?--C'est un visage noble et fier qui sied a un homme de son rang,repondit l'abbe."--C'est un visage de pierre! s'ecria la chanoinesse. Il me semble queje vois ma mere, non pas telle que je l'ai connue, sensible etbienveillante, mais telle qu'elle est peinte, immobile et glacee dansson cadre de bois de chene."--Je repete a votre seigneurie, dit l'abbe, que c'est l'expressionhabituelle du comte Albert depuis huit annees."--Helas! il y a donc huit mortelles annees qu'il n'a souri a personne!dit la bonne tante en laissant couler ses larmes; car depuis deux heuresque je le couve des yeux, je n'ai pas vu le moindre sourire animer sabouche close et decoloree! Ah! j'ai envie de me precipiter vers lui etde le serrer bien fort sur mon coeur, en lui reprochant sonindifference, en le grondant meme comme autrefois, pour voir si, commeautrefois, il ne se jettera pas a mon cou en sanglotant."--Gardez-vous de pareilles imprudences, ma chere soeur, dit le comteChristian en la forcant de se detourner d'Albert qu'elle regardaittoujours avec des yeux humides. N'ecoutez pas les faiblesses d'un coeurmaternel: nous avons bien assez eprouve qu'une sensibilite excessiveetait le fleau de la vie et de la raison de notre enfant. En ledistrayant, en eloignant de lui toute emotion vive, monsieur l'abbe,conformement a nos recommandations et a celles des medecins, est parvenua calmer cette ame agitee; ne detruisez pas son ouvrage par les capricesd'une tendresse puerile.""La chanoinesse se rendit a ces raisons, et tacha de s'habituer al'exterieur glace d'Albert; mais elle ne s'y habitua nullement, et elledisait souvent a l'oreille de son frere: Vous direz ce que vous voudrez,Christian, je crains qu'on ne nous l'ait abruti, en ne le traitant pascomme un homme, mais comme un enfant malade."Le soir, au moment de se separer, on s'embrassa; Albert recutrespectueusement la benediction de son pere, et lorsque la chanoinessele pressa sur son coeur, il s'apercut qu'elle tremblait et que sa voixetait emue. Elle se mit a trembler aussi, et s'arracha brusquement deses bras, comme si une vive souffrance venait de s'eveiller en lui."--Vous le voyez, ma soeur, dit tout bas le comte, il n'est plus habituea ces emotions, et vous lui faites du mal."En meme temps, peu rassure, et fort emu lui-meme, il suivait des yeuxson fils, pour voir si dans ses manieres avec l'abbe, il surprendraitune preference exclusive pour ce personnage. Mais Albert salua songouverneur avec une politesse tres-froide."--Mon fils, dit le comte, je crois avoir rempli vos intentions etsatisfait votre coeur, en priant monsieur l'abbe de ne pas vous quittercomme il en manifestait deja le projet, et en l'engageant a rester presde nous le plus longtemps qu'il lui sera possible. Je ne voudrais pasque le bonheur de nous retrouver en famille fut empoisonne pour vous parun regret, et j'espere que votre respectable ami nous aidera a vousdonner cette joie sans melange.""Albert ne repondit que par un profond salut, et en meme temps unsourire etrange effleura ses levres."--Helas! dit la chanoinesse lorsqu'il se fut eloigne, c'est donc la sonsourire a present."XXVII."Durant l'absence d'Albert, le comte et la chanoinesse avaient faitbeaucoup de projets pour l'avenir de leur cher enfant, etparticulierement celui de le marier. Avec sa belle figure, son nomillustre et sa fortune encore considerable, Albert pouvait pretendre auxpremiers partis. Mais dans le cas ou un reste d'indolence et desauvagerie le rendrait inhabile a se produire et a se pousser dans lemonde, on lui tenait en reserve une jeune personne aussi bien nee quelui, puisqu'elle etait sa cousine germaine et qu'elle portait son nom,moins riche que lui, mais fille unique, et assez jolie comme on l'est aseize ans, quand on est fraiche et paree de ce qu'on appelle en Francela beaute du diable. Cette jeune personne, c'etait Amelie, baronne deRudolstadt, votre humble servante et votre nouvelle amie."Celle-la, se disait-on au coin du feu, n'a encore vu aucun homme.Elevee au couvent, elle ne manquera pas d'envie d'en sortir pour semarier. Elle ne peut guere aspirer a un meilleur parti; et quant auxbizarreries que pourrait encore presenter le caractere de son cousin,d'anciennes d'habitudes d'enfance, la parente, quelques mois d'intimiteaupres de nous, effaceront certainement toute repugnance, etl'engageront, ne fut-ce que par esprit de famille, a tolerer en silencece qu'une etrangere ne supporterait peut-etre pas. On etait sur del'assentiment de mon pere, qui n'a jamais eu d'autre volonte que cellede son aine et de sa soeur Wenceslawa, et qui, a vrai dire, n'a jamaiseu une volonte en propre."Lorsque apres quinze jours d'examen attentif, on eut reconnu laconstante melancolie et la reserve absolue qui semblaient etre lecaractere decide de mon cousin, mon oncle et ma tante se dirent que ledernier rejeton de leur race n'etait destine a lui rendre aucun eclatpar sa conduite personnelle. Il ne montrait d'inclination pour aucunrole brillant dans le monde, ni pour les armes, ni pour la diplomatie,ni pour les charges civiles. A tout ce qu'on lui proposait, il repondaitd'un air de resignation qu'il obeirait aux volontes de ses parents, maisqu'il n'avait pour lui-meme aucun besoin de luxe ou de gloire. Aprestout, ce naturel indolent n'etait que la repetition exageree de celui deson pere, cet homme calme dont la patience est voisine de l'apathie, etchez qui la modestie est une sorte d'abnegation. Ce qui donne a mononcle une physionomie que son fils n'a pas, c'est un sentimentenergique, quoique depourvu d'emphase et d'orgueil, du devoir social.Albert semblait desormais comprendre les devoirs de la famille; mais lesdevoirs publics, tels que nous les concevons, ne paraissaient pasl'occuper plus qu'aux jours de son enfance. Son pere et le mien avaientsuivi la carriere des armes sous Montecuculli contre Turenne. Ilsavaient porte dans la guerre une sorte de sentiment religieux inspirepar la majeste imperiale. C'etait le devoir de leur temps d'obeir et decroire aveuglement a des maitres. Ce temps-ci, plus eclaire, depouilleles souverains de l'aureole, et la jeunesse se permet de ne pas croire ala couronne plus qu'a la tiare. Lorsque mon oncle essayait de ranimerdans son fils l'antique ardeur chevaleresque, il voyait bien que sesdiscours n'avaient aucun sens pour ce raisonneur dedaigneux."Puisqu'il en est ainsi, se dirent mon oncle et ma tante, ne lecontrarions pas. Ne compromettons pas cette guerison assez triste quinous a rendu un homme eteint a la place d'un homme exaspere. Laissons-levivre paisiblement a sa guise, et qu'il soit un philosophe studieux,comme l'ont ete plusieurs de ses ancetres, ou un chasseur passionnecontre notre frere Frederick, ou un seigneur juste et bienfaisant commenous nous efforcons de l'etre. Qu'il mene des a present la vietranquille et inoffensive des vieillards: ce sera le premier desRudolstadt qui n'aura point eu de jeunesse. Mais comme il ne faut pasqu'il soit le dernier de sa race, hatons-nous de le marier, afin que lesheritiers de notre nom effacent cette lacune dans l'eclat de nosdestinees. Qui sait? peut-etre le genereux sang de ses aieux serepose-t-il en lui par l'ordre de la Providence, afin de se ranimer plusbouillant et plus fier dans les veines de ses descendants."Et il fut decide qu'on parlerait mariage a mon cousin Albert."On lui en parla doucement d'abord; et comme on le trouvait aussi peudispose a ce parti qu'a tous les autres, on lui en parla serieusement etvivement. Il objecta sa timidite, sa gaucherie aupres des femmes. "IIest certain, disait ma tante, que, dans ma jeunesse, un pretendant aussiserieux qu'Albert m'eut fait plus de peur que d'envie, et que je n'eussepas echange ma bosse contre sa conversation.""--II faut donc, lui dit mon oncle, revenir a notre pis-aller, et luifaire epouser Amelie. Il l'a connue enfant, il la considere comme sasoeur, il sera moins timide aupres d'elle; et comme elle est d'uncaractere enjoue et decide, elle corrigera, par sa bonne humeur,l'humeur noire dans laquelle il semble retomber de plus en plus."Albert ne repoussa pas ce projet, et sans se prononcer ouvertement,consentit a me voir et a me connaitre. Il fut convenu que je ne seraisavertie de rien, afin de me sauver la mortification d'un refus toujourspossible de sa part. On ecrivit a mon pere; et des qu'on eut sonassentiment, on commenca les demarches pour obtenir du pape lesdispenses necessaires a cause de notre parente. En meme temps mon pereme retira du couvent, et un beau matin nous arrivames au chateau desGeants, moi fort contente de respirer le grand air, et fort impatientede voir mon fiance; mon bon pere plein d'esperance, et s'imaginantm'avoir bien cache un projet qu'a son insu il m'avait, chemin faisant,revele a chaque mot."La premiere chose qui me frappa chez Albert, ce fut sa belle figure etson air digne. Je vous avouerai, ma chere Nina, que mon coeur battitbien fort lorsqu'il me baisa la main, et que pendant quelques jours jefus sous le charme de son regard et de ses moindres paroles. Sesmanieres serieuses ne me deplaisaient pas; il ne semblait pas contraintle moins du monde aupres de moi. Il me tutoyait comme aux jours de notreenfance, et lorsqu'il voulait se reprendre, dans la crainte de manqueraux convenances, nos parents l'autorisaient et le priaient, en quelquesorte, de conserver avec moi son ancienne familiarite. Ma gaiete lefaisait quelquefois sourire sans effort, et ma bonne tante, transporteede joie, m'attribuait l'honneur de cette guerison qu'elle croyait devoiretre radicale. Enfin il me traitait avec la bienveillance et la douceurqu'on a pour un enfant; et je m'en contentais, persuadee que bientot ilferait plus d'attention a ma petite mine eveillee et aux joliestoilettes que je prodiguais pour lui plaire."Mais j'eus bientot la mortification de voir qu'il se souciait fort peude l'une, et qu'il ne voyait pas seulement les autres. Un jour, ma bonnetante voulut lui faire remarquer une charmante robe bleu lapis quidessinait ma taille a ravir. Il pretendit que la robe etait d'un beaurouge. L'abbe, son gouverneur, qui avait toujours des compliments fortmielleux au bord des levres, et qui voulait lui donner une lecon degalanterie, s'ecria qu'il comprenait fort bien que le comte Albert nevit pas seulement la couleur de mon vetement. C'etait pour Albertl'occasion de me dire quelque chose de flatteur sur les roses de mesjoues, ou sur l'or de ma chevelure. Il se contenta de repondre a l'abbe,d'un ton fort sec, qu'il etait aussi capable que lui de distinguer lescouleurs, et que ma robe etait rouge comme du sang."Je ne sais pourquoi cette brutalite et cette bizarrerie d'expression medonnerent le frisson. Je regardai Albert, et lui trouvai un regard quime fit peur. De ce jour-la, je commencai a le craindre plus qu'al'aimer. Bientot je ne l'aimai plus du tout, et aujourd'hui je ne lecrains ni ne l'aime. Je le plains, et c'est tout. Vous verrez pourquoi,peu a peu, et vous me comprendrez."Le lendemain, nous devions aller faire quelques emplettes a Tauss; laville la plus voisine. Je me promettais un grand plaisir de cettepromenade; Albert devait m'accompagner a cheval. J'etais prete, etj'attendais qu'il vint me presenter la main. Les voitures attendaientaussi dans la cour. Il n'avait pas encore paru. Son valet de chambredisait avoir frappe a sa porte a l'heure accoutumee. On envoya denouveau savoir s'il se preparait. Albert avait la manie de s'habillertoujours lui-meme, et de ne jamais laisser aucun valet entrer dans sachambre avant qu'il en fut sorti. On frappa en vain; il ne repondit pas.Son pere, inquiet de ce silence, monta a sa chambre, et ne put ni ouvrirla porte, qui etait barricadee en dedans, ni obtenir un mot. Oncommencait a s'effrayer, lorsque l'abbe dit d'un air fort tranquille quele comte Albert etait sujet a de longs acces de sommeil qui tenaient del'engourdissement, et que lorsqu'on voulait l'en tirer brusquement, iletait agite et comme souffrant pendant plusieurs jours."--Mais c'est une maladie, cela, dit la chanoinesse avec inquietude."--Je ne le pense pas, repondit l'abbe. Je ne l'ai jamais entendu seplaindre de rien. Les medecins que j'ai fait venir lorsqu'il dormaitainsi, ne lui ont trouve aucun symptome de fievre, et ont attribue cetaccablement a quelque exces de travail ou de reflexion. Ils ontgrandement conseille de ne pas contrarier ce besoin de repos et d'oublide toutes choses."--Et cela est frequent? demanda mon oncle."--J'ai observe ce phenomene cinq ou six fois seulement durant huitannees, repondit l'abbe; et, ne l'ayant jamais trouble par mesempressements, je ne l'ai jamais vu avoir de suites facheuses."--Et cela dure-t-il longtemps? demandai-je a mon tour, fortimpatientee."--Plus ou moins, dit l'abbe, suivant la duree de l'insomnie qui precedeou occasionne ces fatigues: mais nul ne peut le savoir, car monsieur lecomte ne se souvient jamais de cette cause, ou ne veut jamais la dire.Il est extremement assidu au travail, et s'en cache avec une modestiebien rare."--Il est donc bien savant? repris-je."--Il est extremement savant."--Et il ne le montre jamais?"--Il en fait mystere, et ne s'en doute pas lui-meme."--A quoi cela lui sert-il, en ce cas?"--Le genie est comme la beaute, repondit ce jesuite courtisan en meregardant d'un air doucereux: ce sont des graces du ciel qui nesuggerent ni orgueil ni agitation a ceux qui les possedent.""Je compris la lecon, et n'en eus que plus de depit, comme vous pouvezcroire. On resolut d'attendre, pour sortir, le reveil de mon cousin;mais lorsqu'au bout de deux heures, je vis qu'il ne bougeait, j'allaiquitter mon riche habit d'amazone, et je me mis a broder au metier, nonsans casser beaucoup de soies, et sans sauter beaucoup de points.J'etais outree de l'impertinence d'Albert, qui s'etait oublie sur seslivres la veille d'une promenade avec moi, et qui, maintenant,s'abandonnait aux douceurs d'un paisible sommeil, pendant que jel'attendais. L'heure s'avancait, et force fut de renoncer au projet dela journee. Mon pere, bien confiant aux paroles de l'abbe, prit sonfusil, et alla tuer un lievre ou deux. Ma tante, moins rassuree, montales escaliers plus de vingt fois pour ecouter a la porte de son neveu,sans pouvoir entendre meme le bruit de sa respiration. La pauvre femmeetait desolee de mon mecontentement. Quant a mon oncle, il prit un livrede devotion pour se distraire de son inquietude, et se mit a lire dansun coin du salon avec une resignation qui me donnait envie de sauter parles fenetres. Enfin, vers le soir, ma tante, toute joyeuse, vint nousdire qu'elle avait entendu Albert se lever et s'habiller. L'abbe nousrecommanda de ne paraitre ni inquiets ni surpris, de ne pas adresser dequestions a monsieur le comte, et de tacher de le distraire s'ilmontrait quelque chagrin de sa mesaventure."--Mais si mon cousin n'est pas malade, il est donc maniaque?m'ecriai-je avec un peu d'emportement."Je vis la figure de mon oncle se decomposer a cette dure parole, etj'en eus des remords sur-le-champ. Mais lorsque Albert entra sans faired'excuses a personne, et sans paraitre se douter le moins du monde denotre contrariete, je fus outree, et lui fis un accueil tres-sec. Il nes'en apercut seulement pas. Il paraissait plonge dans ses reflexions.Le soir, mon pere pensa qu'un peu de musique l'egaierait. Je n'avais pasencore chante devant Albert. Ma harpe n'etait arrivee que de la veille.Ce n'est pas devant vous, savante Porporina, que je puis me piquer deconnaitre la musique. Mais vous verrez que j'ai une jolie voix, et queje ne manque pas de gout naturel. Je me fis prier; j'avais plus envie depleurer que de chanter; Albert ne dit pas un mot pour m'y encourager.Enfin je cedai; mais je chantai fort mal, et Albert, comme si je luieusse ecorche les oreilles, eut la grossierete de sortir au bout dequelques mesures. Il me fallut toute la force de mon orgueil pour ne pasfondre en larmes, et pour achever mon air sans faire sauter les cordesde ma harpe. Ma tante avait suivi son neveu, mon pere s'etait endormi,mon oncle attendait pres de la porte que sa soeur vint lui dire quelquechose de son fils. L'abbe resta seul a me faire des compliments quim'irriterent encore plus que l'indifference des autres."--Il parait, lui dis-je, que mon cousin n'aime pas la musique."--Il l'aime beaucoup, au contraire, repondit-il; mais c'est selon ..."--C'est selon la maniere dont on chante? lui dis-je en l'interrompant."--C'est, reprit-il sans se deconcerter, selon la disposition de soname; quelquefois la musique lui fait du bien, et quelquefois du mal.Vous l'aurez emu, j'en suis certain, au point qu'il aura craint de nepouvoir se contenir. Cette fuite est plus flatteuse pour vous que lesplus grands eloges.""Les adulations de ce jesuite avaient quelque chose de sournois et derailleur qui me le faisait detester. Mais j'en fus bientot delivree,comme vous allez l'apprendre tout a l'heure."XXVIII."Le lendemain, ma tante, qui ne parle guere lorsque son coeur n'est pasvivement emu, eut la malheureuse idee de s'engager dans une conversationavec l'abbe et le chapelain. Et comme, en dehors de ses affections defamille, qui l'absorbent presque entierement, il n'y a pour elle aumonde qu'une distraction possible, laquelle est son orgueil de famille,elle ne manqua pas de s'y livrer en dissertant sur sa genealogie, et enprouvant a ces deux pretres que notre race etait la plus pure, la plusillustre, et la plus excellente de toutes les familles de l'Allemagne,du cote des femmes particulierement. L'abbe l'ecoutait avec patience etnotre chapelain avec reverence, lorsque Albert, qui ne paraissait pasl'ecouter du tout, l'interrompit avec un peu de vivacite:"--Il me semble, ma bonne tante, lui dit-il, que vous vous faitesquelques illusions sur la preeminence de notre famille. Il est vrai quela noblesse et les titres de nos ancetres remontent assez haut dans lepasse; mais une famille qui perd son nom, qui l'abjure en quelque sorte,pour prendre celui d'une femme de race et de religion etrangere, renonceau droit de se faire valoir comme antique en vertu et fidele a la gloirede son pays."Cette remarque contraria beaucoup la chanoinesse; mais, comme l'abbeavait paru ouvrir l'oreille, elle crut devoir y repondre."--Je ne suis pas de votre avis, mon cher enfant, dit-elle. On a vu biensouvent d'illustres maisons se rendre, a bon droit, plus illustresencore, en joignant a leur nom celui d'une branche maternelle, afin dene pas priver leurs hoirs de l'honneur qui leur revenait d'etre issusd'une femme glorieusement apparentee."--Mais ce n'est pas ici le cas d'appliquer cette regle, reprit Albertavec une tenacite a laquelle il n'etait point sujet. Je concoisl'alliance de deux noms illustres. Je trouve fort legitime qu'une femmetransmette a ses enfants son nom accole a celui de son epoux. Maisl'effacement complet de ce dernier nom me parait un outrage de la partde celle qui l'exige, une lachete de la part de celui qui s'y soumet."--Vous rappelez des choses bien anciennes, Albert, dit la chanoinesseavec un profond soupir, et vous appliquez la regle plus mal a propos quemoi. Monsieur l'abbe pourrait croire, en vous entendant, que quelquemale, dans notre ascendance, aurait ete capable d'une lachete; etpuisque vous savez si bien des choses dont je vous croyais a peineinstruit, vous n'auriez pas du faire une pareille reflexion a propos desevenements politiques ... deja bien loin de nous, Dieu merci!"--Si ma reflexion vous inquiete, je vais rapporter le fait, afin delaver notre aieul Withold, dernier comte des Rudolstadt, de touteimputation injurieuse a sa memoire. Cela parait interesser ma cousine,ajouta-t-il en voyant que je l'ecoutais avec de grands yeux, toutetonnee que j'etais de le voir se lancer dans une discussion sicontraire a ses idees philosophiques et a ses habitudes de silence.Sachez donc, Amelie, que notre arriere-grand-pere Wratislaw n'avait pasplus de quatre ans lorsque sa mere Ulrique de Rudolstadt crut devoir luiinfliger la fletrissure de quitter son veritable nom, le nom de sesperes, qui etait Podiebrad, pour lui donner ce nom saxon que vous et moiportons aujourd'hui, vous sans en rougir, et moi sans m'en glorifier."--Il est au moins inutile, dit mon oncle Christian, qui paraissait fortmal a l'aise, de rappeler des choses si eloignees du temps ou nousvivons."--II me semble, reprit Albert, que ma tante a remonte bien plus hautdans le passe en nous racontant les hauts faits des Rudolstadt, et je nesais pas pourquoi l'un de nous, venant par hasard a se rappeler qu'ilest Boheme, et non pas Saxon d'origine, qu'il s'appelle Podiebrad, etnon pas Rudolstadt, ferait une chose de mauvais gout en parlantd'evenements qui n'ont guere plus de cent vingt ans de date."--Je savais bien, observa l'abbe qui avait ecoute Albert avec uncertain interet, que votre illustre famille etait alliee, dans le passe,a la royaute nationale de George Podiebrad; mais j'ignorais qu'elle endescendit par une ligne assez directe pour en porter le nom."--C'est que ma tante, qui sait dessiner des arbres genealogiques, ajuge a propos d'abattre dans sa memoire l'arbre antique et venerabledont la souche nous a produits. Mais un arbre genealogique sur lequelnotre histoire glorieuse et sombre a ete tracee en caracteres de sang,est encore debout sur la montagne voisine.""Comme Albert s'animait beaucoup en parlant ainsi, et que le visage demon oncle paraissait s'assombrir, l'abbe essaya de detourner laconversation, bien que sa curiosite fut fort excitee. Mais la mienne neme permit pas de rester en si beau chemin."--Que voulez-vous dire, Albert? m'ecriai-je en me rapprochant de lui."--Je veux dire ce qu'une Podiebrad ne devrait pas ignorer, repondit-il.C'est que le vieux chene de la _pierre d'epouvante_, que vous voyez tousles jours de votre fenetre, Amelie, et sous lequel je vous engage a nejamais vous asseoir sans elever votre ame a Dieu, a porte, il y a troiscents ans, des fruits un peu plus lourds que les glands desseches qu'ila peine a produire aujourd'hui."--C'est une histoire affreuse, dit le chapelain tout effare, etj'ignore qui a pu l'apprendre au comte Albert."--La tradition du pays, et peut-etre quelque chose de plus certainencore, repondit Albert. Car on a beau bruler les archives des familleset les documents de l'histoire, monsieur le chapelain; on a beau eleverles enfants dans l'ignorance de la vie anterieure; on a beau imposersilence aux simples par le sophisme, et aux faibles par la menace: ni lacrainte du despotisme, ni celle de l'enfer, ne peuvent etouffer lesmille voix du passe qui s'elevent de toutes parts. Non, non, ellesparlent trop haut, ces voix terribles, pour que celle d'un pretre leurimpose silence! Elles parlent a nos ames dans le sommeil, par la bouchedes spectres qui se levent pour nous avertir; elles parlent a nosoreilles, par tous les bruits de la nature; elles sortent meme du troncdes arbres, comme autrefois, celle des dieux dans les bois sacres, pournous raconter les crimes, les malheurs, et les exploits de nos peres."--Et pourquoi, mon pauvre enfant, dit la chanoinesse, nourrir tonesprit de ces pensees ameres et de ces souvenirs funestes?"--Ce sont vos genealogies, ma tante, c'est le voyage que vous venez defaire dans les siecles passes, qui ont reveille en moi le souvenir deces quinze moines pendus aux branches du chene, de la propre main d'unde mes aieux, a moi ... oh! le plus grand, le plus terrible, le plusperseverant, celui qu'on appelait le redoutable aveugle, l'invincibleJean Ziska du Calice!""Le nom sublime et abhorre du chef des Taborites, sectaires quirencherirent durant la guerre des Hussites sur l'energie, la bravoure,et les cruautes des autres religionnaires, tomba comme la foudre surl'abbe et sur le chapelain. Le dernier fit un grand signe de croix; matante recula sa chaise, qui touchait celle d'Albert."--Bonte divine! s'ecria-t-elle; de quoi et de qui parle donc cetenfant? Ne l'ecoutez pas, monsieur l'abbe! Jamais, non, jamais, notrefamille n'a eu ni lien, ni rapport avec le reprouve dont il vient deprononcer le nom abominable."--Parlez pour vous, ma tante, reprit Albert avec energie. Vous etes uneRudolstadt dans le fond de l'ame, bien que vous soyez dans le fait unePodiebrad. Mais, quant a moi, j'ai dans les veines un sang colore dequelques gouttes de plus de sang boheme, purifie de quelques gouttes demoins de sang etranger. Ma mere n'avait ni Saxons, ni Bavarois, niPrussiens, dans son arbre genealogique: elle etait de pure race slave;et comme vous paraissez ne pas vous soucier beaucoup d'une noblesse alaquelle vous ne pouvez pretendre, moi, qui tiens a ma noblessepersonnelle, je vous apprendrai, si vous l'ignorez, je vous rappellerai,si vous l'avez oublie, que Jean Ziska laissa une fille, laquelle epousaun seigneur de Prachalitz, et que ma mere, etant une Prachalitzelle-meme, descendait en ligne directe de Jean Ziska par les femmes,comme vous descendez des Rudolstadt, ma tante!"--Ceci est un reve, une erreur, Albert!..."--Non, ma chere tante; j'en appelle a monsieur le chapelain, qui est unhomme veridique et craignant Dieu. Il a eu entre les mains lesparchemins qui le prouvaient."--Moi? s'ecria le chapelain, pale comme la mort."--Vous pouvez l'avouer sans rougir devant monsieur l'abbe, reponditAlbert avec une amere ironie, puisque vous avez fait votre devoir depretre catholique et de sujet autrichien en les brulant le lendemain dela mort de ma mere!"--Cette action, que me commandait ma conscience, n'a eu que Dieu pourtemoin! reprit l'abbe, plus pale encore. Comte Albert, qui a pu vousreveler ...?"--Je vous l'ai dit, monsieur le chapelain, la voix qui parle plus hautque celle du pretre!"--Quelle voix, Albert? demandai-je vivement interessee."--La voix qui parle dans le sommeil, repondit Albert."--Mais ceci n'explique rien, mon fils, dit le comte Christian toutpensif et tout triste."--La voix du sang, mon pere! repondit Albert d'un ton qui nous fit toustressaillir."--Helas! mon Dieu! dit mon oncle en joignant les mains, ce sont lesmemes reveries, les memes imaginations, qui tourmentaient sa pauvremere. Il faut que, dans sa maladie, elle ait parle de tout cela devantnotre enfant, ajouta-t-il en se penchant vers ma tante, et que sonesprit en ait ete frappe de bonne heure."--Impossible, mon frere, repondit la chanoinesse: Albert n'avait pastrois ans lorsqu'il perdit sa mere."--Il faut plutot, dit le chapelain a voix basse, qu'il soit reste dansla maison quelques-uns de ces maudits ecrits heretiques, tout remplis demensonge et tissus d'impietes, qu'elle avait conserves par esprit defamille, et dont elle eut pourtant la vertu de me faire le sacrifice ason heure supreme."--Non, il n'en est pas reste, repondit Albert, qui n'avait pas perduune seule parole du chapelain, bien que celui-ci eut parle assez bas, etqu'Albert, qui se promenait avec agitation, fut en ce moment a l'autrebout du grand salon. Vous savez bien monsieur le chapelain, que vousavez tout detruit, et que vous avez encore, au lendemain de _son_dernier jour, cherche et furete dans tous les coins de sa chambre."--Qui donc a ainsi aide ou egare votre memoire, Albert? demanda lecomte Christian d'un ton severe. Quel serviteur infidele ou imprudents'est donc avise de troubler votre jeune esprit par le recit, sans douteexagere, de ces evenements domestiques?"--Aucun, mon pere; je vous le jure sur ma religion et sur maconscience."--L'ennemi du genre humain est intervenu dans tout ceci, dit lechapelain consterne."--Il serait plus vraisemblable et plus chretien de penser, observal'abbe, que le comte Albert est doue d'une memoire extraordinaire, etque des evenements dont le spectacle ne frappe point ordinairement l'agetendre sont restes graves dans son esprit. Ce que j'ai vu de sa rareintelligence me fait aisement croire que sa raison a du avoir undeveloppement fort precoce; et quant a sa faculte de garder le souvenirdes choses, j'ai reconnu qu'elle etait prodigieuse en effet."--- Elle ne vous semble prodigieuse que parce que vous en etes tout afait depourvu, repondit Albert sechement. Par exemple, vous ne vousrappelez pas ce que vous avez fait en l'annee 1619, apres que WitholdPodiebrad le protestant, le vaillant, le fidele (votre grand-pere, machere tante), le dernier qui porta notre nom, eut rougi de son sang lapierre d'epouvante? Vous avez oublie votre conduite en cettecirconstance, je le parierais, monsieur l'abbe?"--Je l'ai oubliee entierement, je l'avoue, repondit l'abbe avec unsourire railleur qui n'etait pas de trop bon gout dans un moment ou ildevenait evident pour nous tous qu'Albert divaguait completement."--Eh bien! je vais vous la rappeler, reprit Albert sans se deconcerter.Vous allates bien vite conseiller a ceux des soldats imperiaux quiavaient fait le coup de se sauver ou de se cacher, parce que lesouvriers de Pilsen, qui avaient le courage de s'avouer protestants, etqui adoraient Withold, venaient pour venger la mort de leur maitre, ets'appretaient a les mettre en pieces. Puis, vous vintes trouver monaieule Ulrique, la veuve tremblante et consternee de Withold, et vouslui promites de faire sa paix avec l'empereur Ferdinand II, de luiconserver ses biens, ses titres, sa liberte, et la tete de ses enfants,si elle voulait suivre vos conseils et vous payer vos services a prixd'or; elle y consentit: son amour maternel lui suggera cet acte defaiblesse. Elle ne respecta pas le martyre de son noble epoux. Elleetait nee catholique, et n'avait abjure que par amour pour lui. Elle nesut point accepter la misere, la proscription, la persecution, pourconserver a ses enfants une foi que Withold venait de signer de sonsang, et un nom qu'il venait de rendre plus illustre encore que tousceux de ses ancetres _hussites, calixtins, taborites, orphelins, freresde l'union, et lutheriens_. (Tous ces noms, ma chere Porporina, sontceux des diverses sectes qui joignent l'heresie de Jean Huss a celle deLuther, et qu'avait probablement suivies la branche des Podiebrad dontnous descendons.) Enfin, continua Albert, la Saxonne eut peur, et ceda.Vous prites possession du chateau, vous en eloignates les bandesimperiales, vous fites respecter nos terres. Vous fites un immenseauto-da-fe de nos titres et de nos archives. C'est pourquoi ma tante,pour son bonheur, n'a pu retablir l'arbre genealogique des Podiebrad, ets'est rejetee sur la pature moins indigeste des Rudolstadt. Pour prix devos services, vous futes riche, tres-riche. Trois mois apres, il futpermis a Ulrique d'aller embrasser a Vienne les genoux de l'empereur,qui lui permit gracieusement de denationaliser ses enfants, de les faireelever par vous dans la religion romaine, et de les enroler ensuite sousles drapeaux contre lesquels leur pere et leurs aieux avaient sivaillamment combattu. Nous fumes incorpores mes fils et moi, dans lesrangs de la tyrannie autrichienne ..."--Tes fils et toi!... dit ma tante desesperee, voyant qu'il battait lacampagne."--Oui, mes fils Sigismond et Rodolphe, repondit tres-serieusementAlbert."--C'est le nom de mon pere et de mon oncle, dit le comte Christian.Albert, ou est ton esprit? Reviens a toi, mon fils. Plus d'un sieclenous separe de ces evenements douloureux accomplis par l'ordre de laProvidence.""Albert n'en voulu
