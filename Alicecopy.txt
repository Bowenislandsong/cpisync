ing thegreat care I took to conceal it, it is known to be mine; I think myselfobliged, in my own defence, to take some notice of it[1].' The omissionof this Preface, which contained an answer to part of the sermon, andgave her reasons for writing the poem, had occasioned some people tomake ill-natured reflexions on it: this put her ladyship on justifyingherself, and assuring her readers, that there are no reflexions in itlevelled at any particular persons, besides the author of the Sermon;him (says she) I only blame for being too angry, for his not telling usour duty in a softer more engaging way: address, and good manners renderreproofs a kindness; but where they are wanting, admonitions are alwaystaken ill: as truths of this sort ought never to be concealed from us,so they ought never to be told us with an indecent warmth; a respectfultenderness would be more becoming a messenger of peace, the disciple ofan humble, patient, meek, commiserating Saviour.'Besides this lady's poems, of which we shall give some account when wequote a specimen; she wrote Essays upon several subjects, in prose andverse, printed in 8vo. 1710. These Essays are upon Knowledge, Pride,Humility, Life, Death, Fear, Grief, Riches, Self-love, Justice, Anger,Calumny, Friendship, Love, Avarice, Solitude, and are much admired forthe delicacy of the stile, there being not the least appearance of falsewit, or affected expression, the too common blemishes of this sort ofwriting: they are not so much the excursions of a lively imagination,which can often expatiate on the passions, and actions of men, withsmall experience of either, as the deliberate result of observations onthe world, improved with reading, regulated with judgment, softened bygood manners, and heightened with sublime thoughts, and elevated piety.This treatise is dedicated to her Royal Highness the Princess Sophia,Electress, and Duchess Dowager of Brunswick, on which occasion thatPrincess, then in her 80th year, honoured her with the followingepistle, written by the Electress in French, but which we shall herepresent to the reader in English.  Hanover June 25, 1710.  LADY CHUDLEIGH,  You have done me a very great pleasure in letting  me know by your agreeable book, that there  is such a one as you in England, and who has so  well improved herself, that she can, in a fine manner,  communicate her sentiments to all the world.  As for me I do not pretend to deserve the commendations  you give me, but by the esteem which I  have of your merit, and of your good sense, I will  be always entirely  Your affectionate friend  to serve you,  SOPHIA ELECTRICE.At the end of the second volume of the duke of Wharton's poems, are fiveletters from lady Chudleigh, to the revd. Mr. Norris of Bemmerton, andMrs. Eliz. Thomas, the celebrated Corinna of Dryden.She wrote several other things, which, though not printed, are carefullypreserved in the family, viz. two Tragedies, two Operas, a Masque, someof Lucian's Dialogues, translated into Verse, Satirical Reflexions onSaqualio, in imitation of one of Lucian's Dialogues, with several smallPoems on various Occasions.She had long laboured under the pains of a rheumatism, which hadconfined her to her chamber a considerable time before her death, whichhappened at Ashton in Devonshire, December 15, 1710, in the 55th year ofher age, and lies buried there without either monument or inscription.The poetical Works of this Lady consist chiefly in the Song of the ThreeChildren Paraphrased, some Pindaric Odes, Familiar Epistles, and Songs.We shall select as a specimen, a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa,occasioned by the death of her Ladyship's Daughter, in the early bloomof her youth. It is of a very melancholy cast, and expressive of thegrief me must have felt upon that tender occasion. Her ladyship hasinformed us in her preface to her poems, that she generally chosesubjects suited to her present temper of mind. 'These pieces (says she)were the employments of my leisure hours, the innocent amusements of asolitary life; in them the reader will find a picture of my mind, mysentiments all laid open to their view; they will sometimes see mechearful, pleased, sedate, and quiet; at other times, grieving,complaining, and struggling with my passions, blaming myself,endeavouring to pay homage to my reason, and resolving for the futurewith a decent calmness, an unshaken constancy, and a resigning temper,to support all the troubles, all the uneasiness of life, and then,by unexpected emergencies, unforeseen disappointments, sudden, andsurprising turns of fortune, discomposed, and shock'd, 'till I haverallied my scattered fears, got new strength, and by making unweariedresistance, gained the better of my afflictions, and restored my mind toits former tranquility. Would we (continues her ladyship) contract ourdesires, and learn to think that only necessary, which nature has madeso; we should be no longer fond of riches, honours, applauses, andseveral other things, which are the unhappy occasions of much mischiefto the world; and doubtless, were we so happy as to have a true notionof the dignity of our nature, of those great things for which we weredesigned, and of the duration and felicity of that state to which we arehastening, we should scorn to stoop to mean actions, and blush at thethoughts of doing any thing below our character.' In this manner doesour authoress discover her sentiments of piety. We now shall subjoin thespecimen;DIALOGUE.MARISSA.  O my Lucinda! O my dearest friend!  Must my afflictions never, never end!  Has Heav'n for me, no pity left in store,  Must I! O must I ne'er be happy more!  Philanda's loss had almost broke my heart,  From her alas! I did but lately part:  And must there still be new occasions found  To try my patience, and my soul to wound?  Must my lov'd daughter too be snatch'd away,  Must she so soon the call of fate obey?  In her first dawn, replete with youthful charms,  She's fled, she's fled, from my deserted arms.  Long did she struggle, long the war maintain,  But all th' efforts of life, alas! were vain.  Could art have saved her, she had still been  mine,  Both art and care together did combine:  But what is proof against the will divine?  Methinks I still her dying conflict view,  And the sad sight does all my grief renew;  Rack'd by convulsive pains, she meekly lies,  And gazes on me with imploring eyes;  With eyes which beg relief, but all in vain,  I see but cannot, cannot ease her pain.  She must the burden unassisted bear,  I cannot with her in her tortures share:  Would they were mine, and me flood easy by;  For what one loves, sure 'twere not hard to die.  See how me labours, how me pants for breath,  She's lovely still, she's sweet, she's sweet in  death!  Pale as she is, me beauteous does remain,  Her closing eyes their lustre still retain:  Like setting suns with undiminish'd light,  They hide themselves within the verge of night.  She's gone, she's gone, she sigh'd her soul away!  And can I, can I any longer stay?  My life alas has ever tiresome been,  And I few happy easy days have seen;  But now it does a greater burden grow,  I'll throw it off, and no more sorrow know,  But with her to calm peaceful regions go.  Stay, thou dear innocence, retard thy flight,  O stop thy journey to the realms of light;  Stay 'till I come: to thee I'll swiftly move,  Attracted by the strongest passion, love.LUCINDA.  No more, no more let me such language hear,  I can't, I can't the piercing accents bear:  Each word you utter stabs me to the heart,  I could from life, not from Marissa part:  And were your tenderness as great as mine,  While I were left, you would net thus repine.  My friends are riches, health, and all to me;  And while they're mine I cannot wretched be.MARISSA.  If I on you could happiness bestow,  I still the toils of life would undergo,  Would still contentedly my lot sustain,  And never more of my hard fate complain:  But since my life to you will useless prove,  O let me hasten to the joys above:  Farewel, farewel, take, take my last adieu,  May Heaven be more propitious still to you,  May you live happy when I'm in my grave,  And no misfortunes, no afflictions have:  If to sad objects you'll some pity lend  And give a sigh to an unhappy friend,  Think of Marissa, and her wretched state,  How's she's been us'd by her malicious fate;  Recount those storms which she has long sustain'd,  And then rejoice that she the part has gain'd;  The welcome haven of eternal rest,  Where she shall be for ever, ever bless'd;  And in her mother's, and her daughter's arms  Shall meet with new, with unexperienc'd charms,  O how I long those dear delights to taste;  Farewel, farewel, my soul is much in haste.  Come death; and give the kind releasing blow,  I'm tir'd of life, and overcharg'd with woe:  In thy cool silent, unmolested shade  O let me be by their dear relics laid;  And there with them from all my troubles free,  Enjoy the blessing of a long tranquillity.LUCINDA.  O thou dear sufferer, on my breast recline  Thy drooping head, and mix thy tears with  mine:  Here rest awhile, and make a truce with grief:  Consider; sorrow brings you no relief.  In the great play of life, we must not chuse,  Nor yet the meanest character refuse.  Like soldiers we our general must obey,  Must stand our ground, and not to fear give  way,  But go undaunted on'till we have won the day.  Honour is ever the reward of pain,  A lazy virtue no applause will gain.  All such as to uncommon heights would rise,  And on the wings of fame ascend the skies,  Must learn the gifts of fortune to despise;  They to themselves their bliss must still confine,  Must be unmoved, and never once repine:  But few to this perfection can attain,  Our passions often will th' ascendant gain,  And reason but alternately does reign;  Disguised by pride we sometimes seem to bear  A haughty port, and scorn to shed a tear;  While grief within still acts a tragic part,  And plays the tyrant in the bleeding heart.  Your sorrow is of the severest kind,  And can't be wholly to your soul confin'd,  Losses like yours may be allowed to move  A gen'rous mind, that knows what 'tis to love.  These afflictions;--  Will teach you patience, and the careful skill  To rule your passions, and command your will;  To bear afflictions with a steady mind,  Still to be easy, pleas'd, and still resign'd,  And look as if you did no inward sorrow find.MARISSA.  I know Lucinda this I ought to do,  But oh! 'tis hard my frailties to subdue;  My headstrong passions will resistance make,  And all my firmed resolutions make.  I for my daughter's death did long prepare,  And hop'd I should the stroke with temper bear,  But when it came grief quickly did prevail,  And I soon found my boasted courage fail:  Yet still I strove, but 'twas alas! in vain,  My sorrow did at length th' ascendant gain:  But I'm resolv'd I will no longer yield;  By reason led, I'll once more take the field,  And there from my insulting passions try,  To gain a full, a glorious victory:  Which 'till I've done, I never will give o'er  But still fight on, and think of peace no more;  With an unwearied courage still contend,  'Till death, or conquest, doth my labour end.[Footnote 1: Preface to her Essays.]       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS CREECH.This gentleman was born near Sherborne in Dorsetshire, and bred up atthe free school in that town, under Mr. Carganven, a man of eminentcharacter, to whom in gratitude he inscribes one of the Idylliums ofTheocritus, translated by him. His parents circumstances not beingsufficient to bestow a liberal education upon him, colonel Strangeways,who was himself a man of taste and literature, took notice of the earlycapacity of Creech, and being willing to indulge his violent propensityto learning, placed him at Wadham College in Oxford, in the 16th yearof his age, anno 1675, being then put under the tuition of two of thefellows. In the year 1683 he was admitted matter of arts, andsoon elected fellow of All-soul's College; at which time he gavedistinguished proofs of his classical learning, and philosophy, beforethose who were appointed his examiners. The first work which broughtour author into reputation, was his translation of Lucretius, whichsucceeded so well, that Mr. Creech had a party formed for him, whoventured to prefer him to Mr. Dryden, in point of genius. Mr. Drydenhimself highly commended his Lucretius, and in his preface to the secondvolume of Poetical Miscellanies thus characterises it. 'I now call tomind what I owe to the ingenious, and learned translator of Lucretius.I have not here designed to rob him of any part of that commendation,which he has so justly acquired by the whole author, whose fragmentsonly fall to my portion. The ways of our translation are very different;he follows him more closely than I have done, which became aninterpreter to the whole poem. I take more liberty, because it bestsuited with my design, which was to make him as pleasing as I could. Hehad been too voluminous, had he used my method, in so long a work; andI had certainly taken his, had I made it my business to translate thewhole. The preference then is justly his; and I join with Mr. Evelyn inthe confession of it, with this additional advantage to him, that hisreputation is already established in this poet; mine is to make itsfortune in the world. If I have been any where obscure in followingour common author; or if Lucretius himself is to be condemned, I refermyself to his excellent annotations, which I have often read, and alwayswith some pleasure.'Many poets of the first class, of those times, addressed Mr. Creech incommendatory verses, which are prefixed to the translation of Lucretius:but this sudden blaze of reputation was soon obscured, by his failingin an arduous task, which the success of his Lucretius prompted him toattempt. This was a translation of the works of Horace, an author morediversified, and consequently more difficult than Lucretius. Some haveinsinuated, that Mr. Dryden, jealous of his rising fame, and willingto take advantage of his vanity, in order to sink his reputation,strenuously urged him to this undertaking, in which he was morallycertain Creech could not succeed. Horace is so, various, so exquisite,and perfectly delightful, that he who culls flowers in a garden soreplenished with nature's productions, must be well acquainted with herform, and able to delineate her beauties. In this attempt Creech failed,and a shade was thrown over his reputation, which continued to obscureit to the end of his life. It is from this circumstance alleged, thatMr. Creech contracted a melancholy, and moroseness of temper, whichoccasioned the disinclination of many towards him, and threw him intohabits of recluseness, and discontent. To this some writers likewiseimpute the rash attempt on his own life, which he perpetrated at Oxford,in 1701. This act of suicide could not be occasioned by want, for Mr.Jacob tells us, that just before that accident, he had been presented bythe college to the living of Welling in Hertfordshire. Mr. Barnardin his Nouvelles de la Republiques de Lettres, assigns another causebesides the diminution of his fame, which might occasion this disastrousfate. Mr. Creech, though a melancholy man, was yet subject to thepassion of love. It happened that he fixed his affections on a lady whohad either previously engaged hers, or who could not bestow them uponhim; this disappointment, which was a wound to his pride, so affectedhis mind, that, unable any longer to support a load of misery, he hangedhimself in his own chamber. Which ever of these causes induced him,the event was melancholy, and not a little heightened by his being aclergyman, in whose heart religion should have taken deeper root, andmaintained a more salutary influence, than to suffer him thus to stainhis laurels with his own blood.Mr. Creech's works, besides his Lucretius already mentioned, are chieflythese,The Second Elegy of Ovid's First Book of Elegies. The 6th, 7th, 8th, and12th Elegies of Ovid's Second Book of Elegies. The 2d and 3d Eclogue ofVirgil. The Story of Lucretia, from Ovid de Fastis. B. ii. The Odes,Satires, and Epistles of Horace already mentioned, dedicated to JohnDryden, esq; who is said to have held it in great contempt, which gavesuch a shock to Mr. Creech's pride. The author in his preface tothis translation has informed us, that he had not an ear capable ofdistinguishing one note in music, which, were there no other, was asufficient objection against his attempting the most musical poet in anylanguage.The same year he published his Translation of the Idylliums ofTheocritus, with Rapin's Discourse on Pastorals, as also the Life ofPhelopidas, from the Latin of Cornelius Nepos.In Dryden's Translation of Juvenal and Persius, Mr. Creech did the 13thSatire of Juvenal, and subjoined Notes. He also translated into English,the verses before Mr. Quintenay's Compleat Gardiner. The Life of Solon,from the Greek of Plutarch. Laconic Apophthegms, or Remarkable Sayingsof the Spartans, printed in the first Volume of Plutarch's Morals.A Discourse concerning Socrates's Daemon. The two First Books of theSymposiacs.These are the works of Mr. Creech: A man of such parts and learning,according to the accounts of all who have written of him, that, had henot by the last act of his life effaced the merit of his labours, hewould have been an ornament as well to the clerical profession, as hiscountry in general. He well understood the ancients, had an unusualpenetration in discovering their beauties, and it appears by his owntranslation of Lucretius, how elegantly he could cloath them in anEnglish attire. His judgment was solid; he was perfectly acquainted withthe rules of criticism, and he had from nature an extraordinary genius.However, he certainly over-rated his importance, or at lead his friendsdeceived him, when they set him up as a rival to Dryden! but if he wasinferior to that great man in judgment, and genius, there were few ofthe same age to whom he needed yield the palm. Had he been content to bereckoned only the second, instead of the first genius of the times, hemight have lived happy, and died regreted and reverenced, but like Caesarof old, who would rather be the lord of a little village, than thesecond man in Rome, his own ambition overwhelmed him.We shall present the reader with a few lines from the second Book ofLucretius, as a specimen of our author's versification, by which it willbe found how much he fell short of Dryden in point of harmony, though heseems to have been equal to any other poet, who preceded Dryden, in thatparticular.  'Tis pleasant, when the seas are rough, to stand,  And view another's danger, safe at land:  Not 'cause he's troubled, but 'tis sweet to see  Those cares and fears, from which our selves are free.  'Tis also pleasant to behold from far  How troops engage, secure ourselves from war.  But above all, 'tis pleasantest to get  The top of high philosophy, and sit  On the calm, peaceful, flourishing head of it:  Whence we may view, deep, wondrous deep below,  How poor mistaken mortals wand'ring go,  Seeking the path to happiness: some aim  At learning, wit, nobility, or fame:  Others with cares and dangers vex each hour  To reach the top of wealth, and sov'reign pow'r:  Blind wretched man! in what dark paths of strife  We walk this little journey of our life!  While frugal nature seeks for only ease;  A body free from pains, free from disease;  A mind from cares and jealousies at peace.  And little too is needful to maintain  The body sound in health, and free from pain:  Not delicates, but such as may supply  Contented nature's thrifty luxury:  She asks no more. What tho' no boys of gold  Adorn the walls, and sprightly tapers hold,  Whose beauteous rays, scatt'ring the gawdy light,  Might grace the feast, and revels of the night:  What tho' no gold adorns; no music's sound  With double sweetness from the roofs rebound;  Yet underneath a loving myrtle's shade,  Hard by a purling stream supinely laid,  When spring with fragrant flow'rs the earth has spread,  And sweetest roses grow around our head;  Envy'd by wealth and pow'r, with small expence  We may enjoy the sweet delights of sense.  Who ever heard a fever tamer grown  In cloaths embroider'd o'er, and beds of down.  Than in coarse rags?  Since then such toys as these  Contribute nothing to the body's ease,  As honour, wealth, and nobleness of blood,  'Tis plain they likewise do the mind no good:  If when thy fierce embattell'd troops at land  Mock-fights maintain; or when thy navies Hand  In graceful ranks, or sweep the yielding seas,  If then before such martial fights as these,  Disperse not all black jealousies and cares,  Vain dread of death, and superstitious fears  Not leave thy mind; but if all this be vain,  If the same cares, and dread, and fears remain,  If Traytor-like they seize thee on the throne,  And dance within the circle of a crown;  If noise of arms, nor darts can make them fly,  Nor the gay sparklings of the purple dye.  If they on emperors will rudely seize,  What makes us value all such things as these,  But folly, and dark ignorance of happiness?  For we, as boys at night, by day do fear  Shadows as vain, and senseless as those are.  Wherefore that darkness, which o'erspreads our fouls,  Day can't disperse; but those eternal rules,  Which from firm premises true reason draws,  And a deep insight into nature's laws.       *       *       *       *       *ARTHUR MAYNWARING, Esq;A Gentleman distinguished both for poetry and politics, as well as thegay accomplishments of life. He was born at Ightfield, in the year 1668,and educated at the grammar-school at Shrewsbury, where he remainedfour or five years; and at about seventeen years of age, was removed toChrist's Church in Oxford, under the tuition of Mr. George Smalridge,afterwards bishop of Bristol. After he removed from Oxford, he wentinto Cheshire, where he lived several years with his uncle, Mr. FrancisCholmondley, a gentleman of great integrity and honour; but by apolitical prejudice, very averse to the government of William the IIId,to whom he refused to take the oaths, and instilled anti-revolutionprinciples into his nephew,[1] who embraced them warmly; and on hisfirst entry into life, reduced to practice what he held in speculation.He wrote several pieces in favour of James the IId's party: amongstwhich was a Panegyric on that King. He wrote another intitled the Kingof Hearts, to ridicule lord Delamere's entry into London, at his firstcoming to town after the revolution. This poem was said to be Dryden's,who was charged with it by Mr. Tonson; but he disowned it, and told himit was written by an ingenious young gentleman, named Maynwaring, thenabout twenty two years of age.When our author was introduced to the acquaintance of the duke ofSomerset, and the earls of Dorset, and Burlington, he began to entertain(says Oldmixon) very different notions of politics: Whether from theforce of the arguments made use of by those noblemen; or, from adesire of preferment, which he plainly saw lay now upon the revolutioninterest, cannot be determined; but he espoused the Whig ministry, aszealously as he had formerly struggled for the exiled monarch.Our author studied the law till he was five or six and twenty yearsold, about which time his father died, and left him an estate of neareight-hundred pounds a year, but so incumbred, that the interest moneyamounted to almost as much as the revenue. Upon the conclusion of thepeace of Ryswick, he went to Paris, where he became acquainted withMonsieur Boileau, who invited him to his country house, entertained himvery elegantly, and spoke much to him of the English poetry, but all byway of enquiry; for he affected to be as ignorant of the English Muse,as if our nation had been as barbarous as the Laplanders.A gentleman, a friend of Mr. Maynwaring, visiting him some time after,upon the death of Mr. Dryden 'Boileau, said that he was wonderfullypleased to see by the public papers, that the English nation had paid soextraordinary honours to one of their poets, burying him at the publiccharge;' and then asked the gentleman who that poet was, with as muchindifference as if he had never heard Dryden's name; which he could nomore be unacquainted with, than our country was with his; for he oftenfrequented lord Montague's house, when he was embassador in France, andbeing also an intimate friend of Monsieur De la Fontaine, who had spentsome time in England, it was therefore impossible he could be ignorantof the fame of Dryden; but it is peculiar to that nation to hold allothers in contempt. The French would as fain monopolize wit, as thewealth and power of Europe; but thanks to the arms and genius ofBritain, they have attempted both the one and the other without success.Boileau's pretending not to know Dryden, to use the words of Milton,'argued himself unknown.' But perhaps a reason may be assigned, why thewits of France affected a contempt for Mr. Dryden, which is this. Thatpoet, in many of his Prefaces and Dedications, has unanswerably shewn,that the French writers are really deficient in point of genius;' thatthe correctness for which they are remarkable, and that even pace whichthey maintain in all their dramatic compositions, is a proof that theyare not capable of sublime conceptions; that they never rise to anydegree of elevation, and are in truth uninspired by the muses:--Judgmentthey may have to plan and conduct their designs; but few French poetshave ever found the way of writing to the heart. Have they attained thesublime height of Shakespear, the tenderness of Otway, or the pomp ofRowe? and yet these are names which a French versifier will pretend,with an air of contempt, never to have heard of.The truth is, our poets have lately done the French too much honour, bytranslating their pieces, and bringing them on the stage; as if our ownstock was exhausted and the British genius had failed: But it is somesatisfaction that these attempts seem now to be discouraged; we haveseen a late play of theirs (we call it a play, for it was neither atragedy nor a comedy) translated by a languid poet of our own, receivedwith the coolness it deserved.But to return to Mr. Maynwaring. Upon his arrival in England, fromFrance, he was made one of the commissioners of the customs, in whichpost he distinguished himself by his skill and fidelity. Of the latterof these qualities we have an instance, in his treatment of a man, whosollicited to be a tide-waiter: Somebody had told him that his best wayto succeed would be to make a present. The advice had been perhapsgood enough if he had not mistaken his man. For understanding thatMr. Maynwaring had the best interest at the board of any of thecommissioners, with the lords of the treasury; he sent him a letter,with a purse of fifty-guineas, desiring his favour towards obtaining theplace he sollicited: Afterwards he delivered a petition to the board,which was read, and several of the commissioners having spoke to it, Mr.Maynwaring took out the purse of fifty guineas, and the letter, tellingthem that as long as he could prevent it, that man should never havethis, or any other place in the revenue[2].Mr. Maynwaring was admitted a member of the Kit-Kat Club, and wasconsidered as one of the chief ornaments of it, by his pleasantry andwit.In the beginning of queen Anne's reign, lord treasurer Godolphin,engaged Mr. Donne, to quit the office of auditor of the imprests, hislordship paying him several thousand pounds for his doing it, and henever let Mr. Maynwaring know what he was doing for him, till he madehim a present of a patent for that office, worth about two-thousandpounds a year in time of business. In the Parliament which met in 1705,our author was chosen a burgess for Preston in Lancashire[3].He had a considerable share in the Medley, and was author of severalother pieces, of which we shall presently give some account.He died at St. Albans, November the 13th, 1712, having some time beforemade his will; in which he left Mrs. Oldfield, the celebrated actresshis executrix, by whom he had a son, named Arthur Maynwaring. He dividedhis estate pretty equally between that child, Mrs. Oldfield, and hissister; Mr. Oldmixon tells us, that Mr. Maynwaring loved this actress,for nine or ten years before his death, with the strongest passion:It was in some measure owing to his instructions that she became sofinished a player; for he understood the action of the stage as wellas any man, and took great pleasure to see her excell in it. He wroteseveral Prologues and Epilogues for her, and would always hear herrehearse them in private, before she spoke them on the stage. Hisfriends of both sexes quarrelled with him for his attachment to her, andso much resented it, that Mrs. Oldfield frequently remonstrated to him,that it was for his honour and interest to break off the intrigue: whichfrankness and friendship of hers, did, as he often confessed, but engagehim the more firmly; and all his friends at last gave over importuninghim to leave her, as she gained more and more upon him.In honour of our author, Mr. Oldmixon observes, that he had anabhorrence of those that swore, or talked profanely in conversation.He looked upon it as a poor pretence to wit, and never excused it inhimself or others.--I have already observed, that our author had ashare in the Medley, a paper then set up in favour of the Hanoveriansuccession, in which he combats the Examiner, who wrote on the opposite,or, at least, the High-Church Interest.He also wrote the following pieces.1. Remarks on a late Romance, intitled the Memorial of the Church ofEngland, or the History of the Ten Champions.2. A Translation of the second Ode, of the first book of Horace.3. A Translation of the fifth Book of Ovid's Metamorphoses.4. A Character of the new Ministers, 1710.5. Several Songs, Poems, Prologues and Epilogues.6. There was a Manuscript given him to peruse, which contained Memoirsof the duke of Marlborough's famous march to Blenheim: It was written bya chaplain of the duke's, with great exactness as to the incidents, butwas defective in form. Mr. Maynwaring was desired to alter and improveit, which he found too difficult a task; but being greatly pleased withthe particular account of all that pass'd in that surprizing march,he resolved that it should not be lost, and to give it a new and moreperfect form himself, by reducing a kind of diary into a regularhistory. These papers fell into the hands of Sir Richard Steel.7. A Translation of part of Tully's Offices.8. Four Letters to a Friend in North-Britain, written upon thepublishing Dr. Sacheveral's Trial.9. The History of Hannibal, and Hanno, from the best authors: In thispiece he is supposed to intend by Hannibal, the duke of Marlborough; byHanno, the lord treasurer Oxford, by Valerius Flaccus, count Tallard,and by Asdrubal, Dr. Robinson, bishop of Bristol.10. The Speech of Alcibiades to the Athenians, printed in theWhig-Examiner, Numb. 3.11. The French King's Promise to the Pretender.12. A Short Account, and Defence of the Barrier Treaty.13. Remarks upon the present Negotiation of Peace, begun betweenGreat-Britain and France.14. The Bewdley Cafe.15. He had a considerable hand in a Letter to a High-Churchman.16. He revived and published a treatise called Bouchain, in a Dialoguebetween the Medley and the Examiner, about the management of the war in1711.17. He wrote a Letter to the Free-holders, a little before the electionof the new Parliament.18. He had a great hand in a pamphlet, entitled the British Academy,wherein he rallied Dr. Swift's Letter to the lord treasurer Oxford,about altering the English language.19. The Letter from Doway, was written by him, or some friend of his,with his assistance.These are chiefly the works of Maynwaring, who was a gentleman ofgenius, and appears to have been a good-natur'd honest man. His morallife has only been blamed for his intrigue with Mrs. Oldfield; but Iam persuaded when the accomplishments of that lady are remembered, (sobright) is employed in the composition of one book, a bookseller maypublish twenty; so that in the very nature of things, a booksellerwithout oppression, a crime which by unsuccessful writers is generallyimputed to them, may grow rich, while the most industrious and ableauthor can arrive at no more than a decent competence: and even to that,many a great genius has never attained.No sooner had Mr. Head a little recovered himself, than we find himcheated again by the syren alurements of pleasure and poetry, in thelatter of which, however, it does not appear he made any proficiency.He failed a second time, in the world, and having recourse to his pen,wrote the first part of the English Rogue, which being too libertine,could not be licensed till he had expunged some of the most lusciousdescriptions out of it.Mr. Winstanley, p. 208, has informed us, that at the coming out of thisfirst part, he was with him at the Three Cup tavern in Holborn drinkinga glass of Rhenish, and made these verses upon him,  What Gusman, Buscan, Francion, Rablais writ,  I once applauded for most excellent wit;  But reading thee, and thy rich fancy's store,  I now condemn, what I admir'd before.  Henceforth translations pack away, be gone,  No Rogue so well writ, as the English one.We cannot help observing, that Winstanley has a little ridiculouslyshewn his vanity, by informing the world, that he could afford to drinka glass of Rhenish; and has added nothing to his reputation by theverses, which have neither poetry nor wit in them.[Footnote 1: Oldmixon's Life of Maynwaring.][Footnote 2: Life, p. xviii. xix.][Footnote 3: Ibid. p. xxii.]       *       *       *       *       *The HON. Mrs. MONK.This Lady was the daughter of the Right Hon. the Lord Molesworth, anobleman of Ireland, and wife of George Monk, Esq; By the force of hernatural genius, she learnt the Latin, Italian, and Spanish tongues, andby a constant reading of the best authors in those languages, became sogreat a proficient, especially in poetry, that she wrote many piecesthat were deemed worthy of publication, and soon after her death, wereprinted and published with the following title, Marinda. Poems, andTranslations upon several occasions, printed in London, 1716. The bookis addressed to her Royal Highness Carolina Princess of Wales, in along dedication, dated March 26, 1716, written by her father, who thusaffectionately speaks of the poems and their author.'Most of them (says he) are the product of the leisure hours of a younggentlewoman lately deceased; who in a remote country retirement, withoutomitting the daily care due to a large family, not only perfectlyacquired the several languages here made use of; but the good morals andprinciples contained in those books, so as to put them in practice, aswell during her life and languishing sickness, as the hour of her death;in short she died not only like a Christian, but a Roman lady, and sobecame at once the object of the grief, and comfort of her relations. Asmuch as I am obliged to be sparing in commending what belongs to me, Icannot forbear thinking some of these circumstances uncommon enough tobe taken notice of: I loved her more, because she deserved it, thanbecause she was mine, and I cannot do greater honour to her memory, thanby consecrating her labours, or rather diversion to your Royal Highness,as we found most of them in her escrutore, after her death, written withher own hand, little expecting, and as little desiring the public shouldhave any opportunity, either of applauding or condemning them.'Mr. Jacob tells us, that these Poems and Translations, shew the truespirit, and numbers of poetry, a delicacy of turn, and justness ofthought and expression. They consist of Ecclogues; the Masque of theVirtues against Love, from Guarini; some translations from the Frenchand Italians; Familiar Epistles, Odes and Madrigals.Her poetry has great warmth, and tenderness of sentiment. The followingEpitaph on a lady of pleasure, was written by her,  O'er this marble drop a tear,  Here lies fair Rosalinde,  All mankind was pleas'd with her,  And she with all mankind.And likewise this Epigram upon another lady of the same character.  Chloe, her gossips entertains,  With stories of her child-bed pains,  And fiercely against Hymen rails:  But Hymen's not so much to blame;  She knows, unless her memory fails,  E'er she was wed, 'twas much the same.The following verses, which breathe a true spirit of tenderness, werewritten by her, on her death-bed at Bath, when her husband was inLondon,  Thou, who dost all my worldly thoughts employ,  Thou pleasing source of all my earthly joy:  Thou tenderest husband, and thou best of friends,  To thee, this first, this last adieu I send.  At length the conqueror death asserts his right,  And will forever veil me from thy sight.  He wooes me to him, with a chearful grace;  And not one terror clouds his meagre face.  He promises a lasting rest from pain;  And shews that all life's fleeting joys are vain.  Th' eternal scenes of Heaven he sets in view,  And tells me, that no other joys are true.  But love, fond love, would yet resist his power;  Would fain a-while defer the parting hour:  He brings the mourning image to my eyes,  And would obstruct my journey to the skies.  But say thou dearest, thou unwearied friend;  Say should'st thou grieve to see my sorrows end?  Thou know'st a painful pilgrimage I have past,  And should'st thou grieve, that rest is come at last;  Rather rejoice to see me shake off life,  And die as I have liv'd, thy faithful wife.       *       *       *       *       *Mr. THOMAS BROWN.This humorous poet was the son of a considerable Farmer of Shiffnall,in Shropshire, and educated at Newport-school in that county, under thereverend and learned Dr. Edwards, a gentleman who had the honour toqualify many persons of distinction for the university. Under thetuition of this master, he attained a knowledge of the Latin, Greek,French, Italian, and Spanish languages, and his exercises were generallyso well performed, that the Dr. was filled with admiration of his parts.From Newport school he removed to Christ's-Church College in Oxford, anddistinguished himself there for his easy attainments in literature; butsome little irregularities of his life would not suffer him tocontinue long at the university. It is probable he became sick of thatdiscipline, which they who spend their life in the recluseness of acollege, are in some measure obliged to submit to. The father of Mr.Brown, who intended to have him educated to some profession, was notmade acquainted with his design of quitting the university, and havingremitted him a sum of money, to be appropriated for the promotion of hisstudies, his son thought proper to defeat his kind intentions. With thismoney, our author plann'd a scheme of going to London, which he soonafter executed, not very advantageously.--'My first business, says he,was to apply myself to those few friends I had there, who conjecturingI had left the university, exclusive of my father's knowledge, gave butslender encouragement to a young beginner. However, no whit daunted (myfirst resolution still standing by me) I launched forth into the world,committing myself to the mercy of fortune, and the uncertain temper ofthe town. I soon acquired a new set of acquaintance; and began to havea relish of what I had only tasted before by hearsay; and indeed, everything served to convince me, I had changed for the better, except thatmy slender subsistance began to waste extremely; and ruminating upon thedifficulty of obtaining a supply, I was then laid under the necessityof thinking what course to steer. I knew how justly I had incurred thedispleasure of an indulgent father, and how far I had put myself fromretrieving his favour. Amidst this serious contemplation! I resolved togo through stitch with my enterprize, let what will come on't: However,that I might use discretion, to palliate an unforeseen event, Idetermined 'twere better to trust to the flexibility of a father'stemper, than to lay too great a stress upon the humanity of fortune,who would let a man of morals starve if he depended on her favours.Therefore, without more ado (having taken my sorrowful leave of my lastguinea, and reduced Carolus Secundus, from a whole number, to decimalfractions) I dispatched a letter into the country, full of excuse, andpenitence, baited with all the submissive eloquence imaginable. In themean time, I was no less sedulous to find out some employment, thatmight suit with my genius, and with my dependencies at home, render mylife easy.'Whether his father was touched by the epistle which our author inconsequence of this resolution wrote to him, we cannot ascertain, asthere is no mention made of it. Soon after this, we find him schoolmaster of Kingston upon Thames, and happy for him, had he continued inthat more certain employment, and not have so soon exchanged it forbeggary and reputation. Mr. Brown, impatient of a recluse life, quittedthe school, and came again to London; and as he found his old companionsmore delighted with his wit, than ready to relieve his necessities, hehad recourse to scribbling for bread, which he performed with varioussuccess. Dr. Drake, who has written a defence of our author's character,prefixed to his works, informs us, that the first piece which broughthim into reputation, was an account of the conversion of Mr. Bays, in aDialogue, which met with a reception suitable to the wit, spirit, andlearning of it. But though this raised his fame, yet it added verylittle to his profit: For, though it made his company exceedinglycoveted, and might have recommended him to the great, as well as tothe ingenious, yet he was of a temper not to chuse his acquaintance byinterest, and slighted such an opportunity of recommending himself tothe powerful and opulent, as, if wisely improved, might have procuredhim dignities and preferments. The stile of this dialogue, was like thatof his ordinary conversation, lively and facetious. It discovered nosmall erudition, but managed with a great deal of humour, in a burlesqueway; which make both the reasoning and the extensive reading, which areabundantly shewn in it, extremely surprizing and agreeable. The samemanner and humour runs through all his writings, whether Dialogues,Letters, or Poems.The only considerable objection, which the critics have made to hisworks is, that they want delicacy. But in answer to this, it may beaffirmed, that there is as much refinement in his works, as the natureof humorous satire, which is the chief beauty of his compositions, willadmit; for, as satire requires strong ideas, the language will sometimesbe less polished. But the delicacy so much demanded, by softening thecolours weakens the drawing. Mr. Brown has been charged with inequalityin his writings: which is inseparable from humanity.Our author's letters, though written carelesly to private friends, bearthe true stamp and image of a genius. The variety of his learning may beseen in the Lacedaemonian Mercury, where abundance of critical questionsof great nicety, are answered with much solidity and judgment, aswell as wit, and humour. But that design exposing him too much to thescruples of the grave and reserved, as well as to the censure, andcuriosity of the impertinent, he soon discontinued it. Besides, as thiswas a periodical work, he who was totally without steadiness, was veryill qualified for such an undertaking. When the press called upon himfor immediate supply, he was often found debauching himself at a tavern,and by excessive drinking unable to perform his engagements with thepublic, by which no doubt the work considerably suffered.But there is yet another reason why Mr. Brown has been charged withinequality in his writings, viz. that most of the anonymous pieces whichhappened to please the town, were fathered upon him. This, though inreality an injury to him, is yet a proof of the universality of hisreputation, when whatever pleased from an unknown hand was ascribedto him; but by these means he was reputed the writer of many thingsunworthy of him. In poetry he was not the author of any long piece, forhe was quite unambitious of reputation of that kind. They are generallyOdes, Satires, and Epigrams, and are certainly not the best part of hisworks. His Translations in Prose are many, and of various kinds. Hisstile is strong and masculine; and if he was not so nice in the choiceof his authors, as might be expected from a man of his taste, he must beexcused; for he performed his translations as a talk, prescribed himby the Booksellers, from whom he derived his chief support. It was themisfortune of our author to appear on the stage of the world, whenfears, and jealousies had soured the tempers of men, and politics, andpolemics, had almost driven mirth and good nature out of the nation:so that the careless gay humour, and negligent chearful wit, whichin former days of tranquility, would have recommended him to theconversation of princes, was, in a gloomy period, lost upon a peopleincapable of relishing genuine humour.An anonymous author who has given the world some account of Mr. Brown,observes, 'that it was not his immorality that hindered him fromclimbing to the top of poetry, and preferment; but that he had aparticular way of sinning to himself. To speak in plain English (sayshe) Tom Brown had less the spirit of a gentleman than the rest ofthe Wits, and more of a Scholar. Tom thought himself as happy with aretailer of damnation in an obscure hole, as another to have gone tothe devil with all the splendour of a fine equipage. 'Twas not thebrightness of Caelia's eyes, nor her gaudy trappings that attracted hisheart. Cupid might keep his darts to himself; Tom always carried hisfire about him. If he had but a mouth, two eyes, and a nose, he neverenquired after the regularity of her dress, or features. He alwaysbrought a good stomach with him, and used but little ceremony in thepreface. As of his mistresses, so he was very negligent in the choice ofhis companions, who were sometimes mean and despicable, a circumstancewhich never fails to ruin a man's reputation. He was of a lazy temper,and the Booksellers who gave him credit enough as to his capacity, hadno confidence to put in his diligence. The same gentleman informs us,that though Tom Brown was a good-natured man, yet he had one perniciousquality, which eternally procured him enemies, and that was, rather tolose his friend, than his joke.One of his lampoons had almost cost him a procession at the cart's tail;nor did he either spare friend or foe, if the megrim of abuse onceseized him. He had a particular genius for scandal, and dealt it outliberally when he could find occasion. He is famed for being the authorof a Libel, fixed one Sunday morning on the doors of Westminster-abbey,and many others, against the clergy and quality. As for religion, Brownnever professed any, and used to say, that he understood the worldbetter than to have the imputation of righteousness laid to his charge:and the world, to be even with him, really thought him an Atheist. Butthough Brown never made any professions of religion, yet it proceededmore from affectation than conviction. When he came upon his death-bed,he expressed remorse for his past life, and discovered at that period,sentiments which he had never before suffered to enter his mind. Thispenitential behaviour, in the opinion of some, was the occasion why allhis brethren neglected him, and did not bestow on his memory one elegiacsong, nor any of the rites of verse. We find no encomiums upon him, butwhat appeared in a Grubstreet Journal, which, however, are much superiorto what was usually to be found there.  ----A mournful muse from Albion swains produce,  Sad as the song a gloomy genius chuse,  In artful numbers let his wit be shewn,  And as he sings of Doron's speak his own;  Such be the bard, for only such is fit,  To trace pale Doron thro' the fields of wit.Towards the latter end of our author's life, we are informed by Mr.Jacob, that he was in favour with the earl of Dorset, who invited him todinner on a Christmas-day, with Mr. Dryden, and some other gentlemen,celebrated for ingenuity, (according to his lordship's usual custom)when Mr. Brown, to his agreeable surprize, found a Bank Note of 50 l.under his plate, and Mr. Dryden at the same time was presented withanother of 100 l. Acts of munificence of this kind were very common withthat generous spirited nobleman.Mr. Brown died in the year 1704, and was interred in the Cloyster ofWestminster-abbey, near the remains of Mrs. Behn, with whom he wasintimate in his life-time. His whole works consisting of Dialogues,Essays, Declamations, Satires, Letters from the Dead to the Living,Translations, Amusements, &c. were printed in 4 vol. 12mo, 1707. Inorder that the reader may conceive a true idea of the spirit and humour,as well as of the character of Tom Brown, we shall here insert anImaginary Epistle, written from the Shades to his Friends among theLiving; with a copy of Verses representing the Employment of hispoetical Brethren in that fancied Region.TOM. BROWN to his Friends among the Living.GENTLEMEN,I bear it with no little concern to find myself so soon forgot among ye;I have paid as constant attendance to post-hours, in expectation to hearfrom ye, as a hungry Irish Man (at twelve) to a three-penny ordinary, ora decayed beau for nice eating to a roasting-cock's. No amorous-keepingfool, banished from his Chloris in town, to his country solitude, haswaited with greater impatience for a kind epistle from her, than I forone from you. I have searched all private packets, and examined everystraggling ghost that came from your parts, without being able to getthe least intelligence of your affairs. This is the third since myarrival in these gloomy regions, and I can give myself no reason why Ihave received none in answer, unless the packet-boat has been takenby the French, or that so little time has quite excluded me from yourmemories. In my first I gave you an account of my journey hither, and myreception among the ingenious in these gloomy regions.I arrived on the Banks of Acheron, and found Charon scooping his wherry,who seeing me approach him, bid me sit down a little, for he had beenhard worked lately, and could not go with a single passenger: I waswilling enough to embrace the proposal, being much fatigued and weary.Having finished what he was about, he cast his rueful aspect up tothe clouds, and demonstrating from thence (as I suppose) it was neardinner-time, he took from out a locker or cupboard in the stern of hispinnace, some provender pinned up in a clean linnen clout, and a jack ofliquor, and fell too without the least shew of ceremony, unless indeedit were to offer me the civility of partaking with him. He mutteredsomething to himself, which might be grace as far as I know; but if itwere, 'twas as short as that at an Auction-dinner, nor did he devourwhat was before him with less application than I have seen some there.For my part, I could not but contemplate on his shaggy locks, hiswither'd sun-burnt countenance, together with the mightiness andsanctity of his beard; but above all, his brawny chopt knuckles employedmy attention: In short, having satisfied the cormorant in his guts,he had time to ask me what country-man I was? to which I submissivelyanswered, an English-man: O, says he, those English-men are merryrogues, and love mischief; I have sometimes a diverting story fromthence: What news have you brought with you? truly I told his highnessI came away a little dissatisfied, and had not made any remarks on theworld for some time before my death; and for news I had not leisure tobring any thing of moment. But ere we had talked much more, we sawtwo other passengers approach us, who, by their often turning to oneanother, and their laying down arguments with their hands, seemed to bein warm debate together; which was as we conjectured; for when theydrew nearer to us, they proved to be a termagant High-Flyer, and apuritanical Scripturian, a fiery Scotchman: Occasional Conformity wastheir subject; for I heard the Scot tell him 'twas all popery, downrightpopery, and that the inquisition in Spain was christianity to it, byretarding the sons of grace from partaking of the gifts of the Lord; hesaid it was the building of Babel, and they were confounded in the worksof their hands by the confusion of tongues; such crys, says he, wentforth before the desolation of the great city.Thou the son of grace, says the other, thou art a son of Satan, and hastpreached up iniquity; ye are the evil tares, and the land can neverprosper 'till ye are rooted out from among the good corn.Thou art an inventer of lies, said the disciple of John Calvin, and thetruth is not in thee; ye are bloody minded wretches, and your fury isthe only sign of your religion, as the steeple is to the church; yourorgans are the prophane tinkling of the cimbals of Satan, that ticklethe ears with vanity.Thus the dispute lasted till they came to us, and getting into the boat,they jostled for preeminence, which might have proved a sharp conflict,had not the old fellow took up a stretcher and parted them. After whichwe parted peaceably over to the other side: being-landed, the Scot and Itook our way together, and left the furious churchman to vent his spleenby himself. We had not travelled long before we came to a populousvillage, where, from the various multitude, our eyes encountered at adistance, we might easily conjecture that something more than ordinaryhad gathered them together in that manner; it resembled (as near asI can describe it) that famous place called Sherrick-fair, or aStaffordshire-Wake. While we were applying our admiration that way, wearrived at a small hut erected for that purpose, where Nero the tyrant,like a blind fiddler, was surrounded by a confused tribe of all sortsand sexes, like another Orpheus among the beasts.The various remarks I made (some dancing, some prancing; some clapping,some knapping; some drinking, some winking; some kissing, some pissing;some reeling, some stealing) urged my curiosity to enquire for whatit was possible those noble sports might be ordained, and was soonsatisfied it was the Anniversary Feast of their Great Lady Proserpine'sbirth-day. But these things that I took to be diverting, so elevated thespleen of my Puritan companion, that he began loudly to exclaim againstthose prophane exercises: he said, they were impure, and lifted upthe mind to lewdness; that those that followed them, were the sons ofBelial, and wore the mark of the beast in their foreheads. I endeavouredto pacify the sanctified brother, by putting him in mind where we were,and that his rashness might draw us into danger, being in a strangeplace; but all was in vain, I but stirred up his fury more; for, turninghis rebukes upon me, he told me, I was myself one of the wicked, and didrejoice in my heart at the deeds of darkness: no, says he, I will not bepacified, I will roar aloud to drown their incantations; yea, I will setout a throat even as the beast that belloweth! so that perceiving themob gather about him, I thought it prudence to steal off, and leave himto the fury of those, whose displeasure he was about to incur.I had not gone far, but I 'spied two brawney champions at a rubbersof cuffs, which by the dexterity of their head's, hands, and heels,I judged could be no other than Englishmen: nor were my sentimentsgroundless, for presently I heard the mob cry out, O! rare Jo! O! rareJo! and attentively Surveying the combatants, I found it to be the merryJo Haynes, fallen out with Plowden the famous Lawyer, about a gameat Nine-holes; and that shout had proclaimed Joe victorious. I wassomething scrupulous of renewing my acquaintance, not knowing how theconqueror, in the midst of his success, might use me for making boldwith his character in my letters from the read; though I felt a secretdesire to discover myself, yet prudence withstood my inclination, 'tilla more convenient season might so that I brushed off to a place where Isaw a concourse of the better sort of people; there I found Millingtonthe famous Auctioneer, among a crowd of Lawyers, Physicians, Scholars,Poets, Critics, Booksellers, &c. exercising his old faculty; for which,gentlemen, he is as particularly famed in these parts, as Herostratusfor firing the famous Temple, or Barthol Swarts, for the invention ofGunpowder. He is head journey-man to Ptolemy, who keeps a Bookseller'sshop here, and rivals even Jacob Tonson in reputation among the greatwits.But most of all I was obliged to admire my friend Millington, who, byhis powerful knack of eloquence, to the wonder of the whole company,sold Cave's Lives of the Fathers to Solomon the Magnificent, and theScotch Directory to the Priests of the Sun; nay, he sold-ArchbishopLaud's Life to Hugh Peters, Hob's Leviathan to Pope Boniface, and pop'dBunyan's Works upon Bellarmine for a piece of unrevealed Divinity; Afterthe sale was over, I took an opportunity of making myself known to him,who caressed me with all the freedom imaginable, asking me, how longI had been in these parts? and what news from the other world? and athousand particular questions about his old friends; to all which Iresponded as well as I could: and having given me a caution to avoidsome people, by whom I was threatened, for exposing them in my letters,we went to take a bottle together.Now I presume, gentlemen, you will conclude it high time for me to takemy leave; nor shall I tire your patience much longer, only permit meto give ye the trouble of some particular services to those honestgentlemen whose generosity gave me the reputation of a funeral abovewhat I e'er expected, especially to Dr. S----t for bestowing the groundI never frequented, to Dr. Garth and the rest for the charge of a hearseand mourning coaches, which I could not have desired, and to Dr. D----kefor designing me a monument I know the world will reflect I neverdeserved; but for that, let my works testify for me. And though ye aresatisfied my genius was never over-fruitful in the product of verse,yet knowing these favours require something a little uncommon to make asuitable return, I shall take my leave in metre, and, if contrary to myopinion, it meets with a kind acceptance from the town, honest Sam. mayclap it in the next edition of the State Poems, with Buckingham's nameto it.  When a scurvy disease had lain hold of my carcase,  And death to my chamber was mounting the stair-case.  I call'd to remembrance the sins I'd committed,  Repented, and thought I'd for Heaven been fitted;  But alas! there is still an old proverb to cross us,  I found there no room for the sons of Parnassus;  And therefore contented like others to fare,  To the shades of Elizium I strait did repair;  Where Dryden and other great wits o' the town,  To reward all their labours, are damn'd to write on.  Here Johnson may boast of his judgment and plot,  And Otway of all the applause that he got;  Loose Eth'ridge presume on his stile and his wit,  And Shadwell of all the dull plays he e'r writ;  Nat. Lee here may boast of his bombast and rapture,  And Buckingham rail to the end of the chapter;  Lewd Rochester lampoon the King and the court,  And Sidley and others may cry him up for't;  Soft Waller and Suckling, chaste Cowley and others,  With Beaumont and Fletcher, poetical brothers,  May here scribble on with pretence to the bays,  E'en Shakespear himself may produce all his plays,  And not get for whole pages one mouth full of praise.  To avoid this disaster, while Congreve reforms,  His muse and his morals fly to Bracegirdle's arms;  Let Vanbrugh no more plotless plays e'er impose,  Stuft with satire and smut to ruin the house;  Let Rowe, if he means to maintain his applause,  Write no more such lewd plays as his Penitent was.  O Satire! from errors instruct the wild bard,  Bestow thy advice to reclaim each lewd bard;  Bid the Laureat sincerely reflect on the matter;  Bid Dennis drink less, but bid him write better;  Bid Durfey cease scribbling, that libelling song-ster;  Bid Gildon and C----n be Deists no longer;  Bid B----t and C----r, those wits of the age,  Ne'er expose a dull coxcomb, but just on the stage;  Bid Farquhar (tho' bit) to his consort be just,  And Motteux in his office be true to his trust;  Bid Duffet and Cowper no longer be mad,  But Parsons and Lawyers mind each their own trade.  To Grubster and others, bold satire advance;  Bid Ayliffe talk little, and P----s talk sense;  Bid K----n leave stealing as well as the rest;  When this can be done, they may hope to be blest.       *       *       *       *       *The Revd. Mr. JOHN POMFRET.This Gentleman's works are held in very great esteem by the commonreaders of poetry; it is thought as unfashionable amongst people ofinferior life, not to be possessed of the poems of Pomfret, as amongstpersons of taste not to have the works of Pope in their libraries. Thesubjects upon which Pomfret wrote were popular, his versification is farfrom being unmusical, and as there is little force of thinking in hiswritings, they are level to the capacities of those who admire them.Our author was son of the rev. Mr. Pomfret, rector of Luton inBedfordshire, and he himself was preferred to the living of Malden inthe same county. He was liberally educated at an eminent grammar schoolin the country, from whence he was sent to the university of Cambridge,but to what college is not certain. There he wrote most of his poeticalpieces, took the degree of master of arts, and very early accomplishedhimself in most kinds of polite literature. A gentleman who writes underthe name of Philalethes, and who was an intimate friend of Pomfret's,has cleared his reputation from the charge of fanaticism, which someof his malicious enemies brought against him. It was shortly after hisleaving the university, that he was preferred to the living of Maldenabovementioned, and was, says that gentleman, so far from beingtinctured with fanaticism, that I have often heard him express hisabhorrence of the destructive tenets maintained by that people, bothagainst our religious and civil rights. This imputation it seems wascast on him by there having been one of his sur-name, though not any wayrelated to him, a dissenting teacher, and who published some rhimes uponspiritual subjects, as he called them, and which sufficiently proved himan enthusiast.About the year 1703 Mr. Pomfret came up to London, for institution andinduction, into a very considerable living, but was retarded for sometime by a disgust taken by dr. Henry Compton, then bishop of London, atthese four lines, in the close of his poem entitled The Choice.  And as I near approach'd the verge of life,  Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)  Should take upon him all my worldly care,  While I did for a better state prepare.The parenthesis in these verses was so maliciously represented to thebishop, that his lordship was given to understand, it could bear noother construction than that Mr. Pomfret preferred a mistress before awife; though the words may as well admit of another meaning, and importno more, than the preference of a single life to marriage; unless thegentlemen in orders will assert, that an unmarried Clergyman cannotlive without a mistress. But the bishop was soon convinced that thisaspersion against him, was no more than an effort of malice, as Mr.Pomfret at that time was really married. The opposition which hisenemies made to him, had, in some measure, its effect; for by theobstructions he met with, he was obliged to stay longer in London thanhe intended, and as the Small-pox then raged in the metropolis, hesickened them, and died in London in the 36th year of his age.The above-mentioned friend of Mr. Pomfret, has likewise shewn theungenerous treatment he met with in regard to his poetical compositions,in a book entitled Poems by the Earl of Roscommon, and Mr. Duke, printed1717, in the preface to which, the publisher has peremptorily insertedthe following paragraph. 'In this collection says he, of my lordRoscommon's poems, care has been taken to insert all I possibly couldprocure, that are truly genuine, there having been several thingspublished under his name, which were written by others, the authors ofwhich I could set down if it were material. Now, says the gentleman,this arrogant editor would have been more just, both to the public, andto the earl of Roscommon's memory, in telling us what things had beenpublished under his lordship's name by others, than by concealing theauthors of any such gross impositions. Instead of which, he is so much astranger to impartiality, that he has been guilty of the very crime heexclaims against; for he has not only attributed the prospect of deathto the earl of Roscommon, which was wrote by Mr. Pomfret, after thedecease of that lord; but likewise another piece entitled the Prayer ofJeremy Paraphrased, prophetically representing the passionate grief ofthe Jewish people, for the loss of their town, and sanctuary, written byMr. Southcot, a gentleman who published it in the year 1717, so that itis to be hoped, in a future edition of the earl of Roscommon's, and Mr.Duke's poems, the same care will be taken to do these gentlemen justice,as to prevent any other person from hereafter injuring the memory of hislordship.'Mr. Pomfret published his poems in the year 1690, to which he hasprefixed a very modest and sensible preface, 'I am not so fond of fame,says he, as to desire it from the injudicious many; nor as so mortifieda temper as not to wish it from the discerning few. 'Tis not themultitude of applauders, but the good fame of the applauders, whichestablishes a valuable reputation.'His poetical compositions consist chiefly of1. The Choice, which we shall insert as a specimen.2. Cruelty and Lust, an Epistolary Essay, founded upon the famousStory which happened in the reign of King James II. Kirk, who was thatPrince's general against the duke of Monmouth. was sollicited by abeautiful lady in behalf of her husband, who then lay under sentence ofdeath. The inhuman general consented to grant his fair petitioner herrequest; but at no less a price than that of her innocence. The ladydoated on her husband, and maintained a hard struggle between virtue,and affection, the latter of which at last prevailed, and she yielded tohis guilty embraces. The next morning Kirk, with unparalleled brutality,desired the lady to look out at the window of his bedchamber, when shewas struck with the horrid sight of her husband upon a scaffold, readyto receive the blow of the executioner; and before she could reach theplace where he was, in order to take a last embrace, her husband was nomore.How far the lady may be justified in this conduct, is not our businessto discuss: if it is called by the name of guilt, none ever had morepressing motives; and if such a crime could admit of an excuse, it mustbe upon such an occasion.3. Several Epistles to his Friends under affliction.4. Upon the Divine Attributes.5. A Prospect of Death.5. Upon the General Conflagration, and the ensuing Judgment. There weretwo pieces of our author's, published after his death by his friendPhilalethes; the first of these entitled Reason, was wrote by him in theyear 1700, when the debates concerning the doctrine of the Trinity werecarried on with so much heat by the Clergy one against another, that theroyal authority was interposed in order to put an end to a controversy,which could never be settled, and which was pernicious in itsconsequences. This is a severe satire, upon one of the parties engagedin that dispute, but his not inserting it amongst his other poems whenhe collected them into a volume, was, on account of his having receivedvery particular favours, from some of the persons therein mentioned. Theother is entitled Dies Novissima, or the Last Epiphany, a Pindaric Odeon Christ's second Appearance to judge the World. In this piece the poetexpresses much heart-felt piety: It is animated, if not with a poetical,at least with so devout a warmth, that as the Guardian has observed ofDivine Poetry, 'We shall find a kind of refuge in our pleasure, and ourdiversion will become our safety.'This is all the account we are favoured with of the life and writingsof Mr. Pomfret: A man not destitute either of erudition or genius, ofunexceptionable morals, though exposed to the malice of antagonists. Ashe was a prudent man, and educated to a profession, he was not subjectto the usual necessities of the poets, but his sphere being somewhatobscure, and his life unactive, there are few incidents recordedconcerning him. If he had not fortune sufficient to render himconspicuous, he had enough to keep his life innocent, which he seems tohave spent in ease and tranquillity, a situation much more to be enviedthan the highest blaze of fame, attended with racking cares, andinnumerable sollicitudes.The CHOICE.  If Heav'n the grateful liberty would give,  That I might chuse my method how to live.  And all those hours propitious fate should lend,  In blissful ease and satisfaction spend,    Near some fair town I'd have a private seat,  Built uniform; not little, nor too great:  Better if on a rising ground it flood  On this side fields, on that a neighb'ring wood.  It should within no other things contain,  But what were useful, necessary, plain:  Methinks 'tis nauseous, and I'd ne'r endure  The needless pomp of gawdy furniture.  A little garden, grateful to the eye,  And a cool rivulet run murm'ring by:  On whose delicious banks a slately row  Of shady Lymes or Sycamores should grow.  At th' end of which a silent study plac'd,  Should be with all the noblest authors grac'd.  Horace and Virgil, in whose mighty lines  Immortal wit and solid learning shines.  Sharp Juvenal, and am'rous Ovid too,  Who all the turns of love's soft passion knew:  He that with judgment reads his charming lines,  In which strong art with stronger nature joins,  Must grant his fancy, does the best excel;  His thoughts so tender, and express'd so well.  With all those moderns, men of steady sense,  Esteem'd for learning, and for eloquence.  In some of these, as fancy should advise.  I'd always take my morning exercise:  For sure no minutes bring us more content,  Than those in pleasing, useful studies spent.    I'd have a clear, and competent estate,  That I might live genteely, but not great:  As much as I could moderately spend,  A little more, sometimes t' oblige a friend.  Nor should the sons of poverty repine  Too much at fortune, they should taste of mine;  And all that objects of true pity were  Should be reliev'd with what my wants could spare:  For that, our Maker has too largely giv'n,  Should be return'd, in gratitude to Heav'n,  A frugal plenty mould my table spread;  With healthy, not luxurious, dimes fed:  Enough to satisfy, and something more  To feed the stranger, and the neighb'ring poor:  Strong meat indulges vice, and pamp'ring food  Creates diseases, and inflames the blood.  But what's sufficient to make nature strong,  And the bright lamp of life continue long,  I'd freely take, and, as I did possess,  The bounteous author of my plenty bless.    I'd have a little vault, but always stor'd  With the best wines each vintage could afford.  Wine whets the wit, improves its native force,  And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse:  By making all our spirits debonair,  Throws off the lees, the sediment of care,  But as the greatest blessing Heav'n lends,  May be debauch'd and serve ignoble ends:  So, but too oft, the Grape's refreshing juice  Does many mischievous effects produce.  My house should no such rude disorders know,  As from high drinking consequently flow:  Nor would I use what was so kindly giv'n  To the dishonour of indulgent Heav'n.  If any neighbour came, he should be free,  Us'd with respect, and not uneasy be,  In my retreat, or to himself or me.  What freedom, prudence, and right reason give,  All men may with impunity receive:  But the least swerving from their rule's too much;  For what's forbidden us, 'tis death to touch.    That life might be more comfortable yet,  And all my joys resin'd, sincere, and great;  I'd chuse two friends, whose company would be  A great advance to my felicity.  Well born, of humour suited to my own;  Discreet, and men, as well as books, have known.  Brave, gen'rous, witty, and exactly free  From loose behaviour, or formality.  Airy, and prudent, merry, but not light;  Quick in discerning, and in judging right.  Secret they should be, faithful to their trust;  In reas'ning cool, strong, temperate, and just.  Obliging, open, without huffing, brave,  Brisk in gay talking, and in sober, grave.  Close in dispute, but not tenacious; try'd  By solid reason, and let that decide.  Not prone to lust, revenge, or envious hate;  Nor busy medlers with intrigues of state.  Strangers to slander, and sworn foes to spight:  Not quarrelsome, but stout enough to fight.  Loyal, and pious, friends to Caesar, true  As dying martyrs, to their Maker too.  In their society I could not miss  A permanent, sincere, substantial bliss.    Would bounteous Heav'n once more indulge; I'd chuse  (For who would so much satisfaction, lose,  As witty nymphs in conversation, give)  Near some obliging, modest fair to live;  For there's that sweetness in a female mind,  Which in a man's we cannot hope to find:  That by a secret, but a pow'rful art,  Winds up the springs of life, and does impart  Fresh vital heat, to the transported heart.    I'd have her reason all her passions sway;  Easy in company, in private gay:  Coy to a fop, to the deserving free,  Still constant to herself, and just to me.  A soul she should have, for great actions fit;  Prudence and wisdom to direct her wit:  Courage to look bold danger in the face,  No fear, but only to be proud, or base:  Quick to advise, by an emergence prest,  To give good counsel, or to take the best.  I'd have th' expression of her thoughts be such  She might not seem reserv'd, nor talk too much.  That shew a want of judgment and of sense:  More than enough is but impertinence.  Her conduct regular, her mirth resin'd,  Civil to strangers to her neighbours kind,  Averte to vanity, revenge, and pride,  In all the methods of deceit untry'd.  So faithful to her friend, and good to all,  No censure might upon her actions fall:  Then would e'en envy be compell'd to say,  She goes the least of woman kind astray.    To this fair creature I'd sometimes retire,  Her conversation would new joys inspire;  Give life an edge so keen, no surly care  Would venture to assault my soul, or dare  Near my retreat to hide one secret snare.  But so divine, so noble a repast  I'd seldom, and with moderation taste,  For highest cordials all their virtue lose  By a too frequent, and too bold an use:  And what would cheer the spirit in distress;  Ruins our health, when taken to excess.    I'd be concern'd in no litigious jar,  Belov'd by all, not vainly popular.  Whate'er assistance I had pow'r to bring  T' oblige my country, or to serve my King,  Whene'er they call'd, I'd readily afford  My tongue, my pen, my counsel, or my sword.  Law suits I'd shun, with as much studious care,  As I would dens where hungry lions are:  And rather put up injuries, than be  A plague to him, who'd be a plague to me.  I value quiet at a price too great,  To give for my revenge so dear a rate:  For what do we by all our bustle gain,  But counterfeit delight, for real pain;    If Heav'n a date of many years would give,  Thus I'd in pleasure, ease, and plenty live.  And as I near approach'd the verge of life,  Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)  Should take upon him all my worldly care,  While I did for a better state prepare.  Then I'd not be with any trouble vex'd;  Nor have the evening of my days perplex'd.  But by a silent, and a peaceful death,  Without a sigh, resign my aged breath:  And when committed to the dust, I'd have  Few tears, but friendly, dropt into my grave.  Then would my exit so propitious be,  All men would wish to live and die, like me.       *       *       *       *       *The LIFE ofDr. WILLIAM KING.This ingenious gentleman, was son of Ezekiel King, of London. Hereceived the rudiments of his education in Westminster-school, underDr. Busby, and was removed from thence to Christ's-Church in Oxford, inMichaelmas term, 1681, when at the age of eighteen. He studied the civillaw, and practiced it at Doctor's Commons, with very great reputation;but the natural gaiety of his temper, and the love of company, betrayedhim into those pleasures, which were incompatible with his profession.Our author, by the reputation of his abilities obtained a patron inthe earl of Pembroke, who upon his being appointed lord Lieutenant ofIreland, press'd him to go over to that kingdom.Upon Dr. King's arrival in Ireland, his excellency appointed him judgeadvocate, sole commissioner of the prizes, and record keeper. There, hewas well received, and countenanced by persons of the most distinguishedrank, and could he have changed his disposition with the climate, hadthen an opportunity of making his fortune; but so far was he fromimproving this occasion to the purposes of his interest, that hereturned back to England, with no other treasure, than a few merryPoems, and humorous Essays. He was naturally of a courteous behaviour,and very obliging: His conversation was chearful, and his wit pleasantand entertaining. But at length he chiefly subsisted on his fellowshipin Christ-Church College: Before this time, he had published his mostingenious Poem, called the Art of Cookery, in imitation of Horace'sArt of Poetry, with some Letters to Dr. Lister and others; occasionedprincipally by the title of a book, published by the Dr. being the worksof Apicius Coelius, concerning the soups and sauces of the ancients,with an extract of the greatest curiosities contained in that book.Amongst his Letters, is one upon the Denti Scalps, or Tooth-picks of theAntients: Another contains an imitation of Horace: Epist. 5. Book I.being his invitation of Torquatus to supper. And a third, containsremarks on lord Grimston's play, called the Lawyer's Fortune; or Love ina Hollow-Tree.At his leisure hours he wrote likewise, The Art of Love, an imitation ofOvid, De Arte Amandi. To which he prefixed an account of Ovid. Inthe latter part of his life, about the year 1711, he published anHistorical Account of the Heathen Gods, and Heroes, for the useof Westminster, and other schools; for the better and more easyunderstanding of the Classics. Besides these performances, we likewisefind three numbers of a project, entitled, the Transactioner, or, UsefulTransactions: Containing a great number of small pieces, which it wouldbe tedious here to enumerate.[1]We have already observed, that our author while in Ireland, neglectedthe best opportunity of encreasing his fortune; and the circumstancewhich occasioned it we find to be this: He had contracted an intimacywhich soon grew into friendship, with judge Upton, a man of the sametemper with himself, who delighted in retirement and poetical amusement.He had a country villa called Mountown, near Dublin, where he and Dr.King used to retire, and spend most of their time without any regard totheir public offices; and by these means neglecting to pay court to thelord lieutenant, they fell under his displeasure. These two poeticalcompanions, indulged no other thoughts but those of living and dying intheir rural retreat. Upon this occasion, Dr. King wrote a Pastoral Poem,called Mully of Mountown: Mully was the name of a Red-Cow which gave himmilk, whom he made the chief subject of his Poem; which at that time thecritics would have imposed upon the word as a political allegory,tho' this was a manner of writing, with which the Dr. was totallyunacquainted.When Dr. King, after his return from Ireland, had retired to live uponhis fellowship at Oxford, he was sollicited by the earl of Anglesey tocome to town, and undertake a cause of his, then before the House ofLords, (in relation to some cruelties he was accused of using to hislady) back'd by the violent prosecution of his mother-in-law, thecountess of Dorchester. Upon this occasion the Doctor shook off theindolence of his nature, and so strenuously engaged in the cause of hispatron, that he gained the reputation of an able lawyer as well as apoet. He naturally hated business, especially that of an advocate; butwhen appointed as a delegate, made a very discerning and able judge, yetnever could bear the fatigue of wrangling. His chief pleasure consistedin trifles, and he was never happier, than when hid from the world. Fewpeople pleased him in conversation, and it was a proof of his likingthem, if his behaviour was tolerably agreeable. He was a greatdissembler of his natural temper, which was fallen, morose, and peevish,where he durst shew it; but he was of a timorous disposition andthe least slight or neglect offered to him, would throw him into amelancholy despondency. He was apt to say a great many ill-natur'dthings, but was never known to do one: He was made up of tenderness,pity, and compassion; and of so feminine a disposition, that tears wouldfall from his eyes upon the smallest occasion.As his education had been strict, so he was always of a religiousdisposition, and would not enter upon the business of the day, till hehad performed his devotion, and read several portions of scripture outof the Psalms, the Prophets, and the New-Testament.It appears from his loose papers, which he calls Adversaria, that hehad been such an arduous student, that before he was eight-years in theuniversity, he had read over and made reflections on twenty-two thousandbooks and manuscripts; a few of which, we shall give as specimen, inorder to let the reader into the humour and taste of our author.'Diogenes Laertius, Book I.----Thales, being asked how a man might mosteasily brook misfortunes? answered, if he saw his enemies in a worsecondition. It is not agreed, concerning the wisemen; or whether indeedthey were seven.''There is a very good letter of Pisistratus to Solon, and of the samestile and character with those of Phalaris.''Solon ordained, that the guardians of orphans should not cohabit withtheir mothers: And that no person should be a guardian to those, whoseestate descended to them at the orphan's decease. That no seal-gravershould keep the seal of a ring that was sold: That, if any man put outthe eye of him who had but one, he should lose both, his own: That,where a man never planted, it should be death to take away: That, itshould be death for a magistrate to be taken in drink. Solon's lettersat the end of his life, in Laertius, give us a truer Idea of the man,than all he has written before, and are indeed very fine: Solon's toCraesus are very genteel; and Pitaccus's on the other side, are rude andphilosophical; However, both shew Craesus to have been a very good man.These epistles give a further reason to believe, that the others werewritten by Phalaris. There is a letter from Cleobulus to Solon, toinvite him to Lindus.''Bion used to say, it was more easy to determine differences, betweenenemies than friends; for that of two friends, one would become anenemy; but of two enemies, one would become a friend.''Anacharsis has an epistle to Craesus, to thank him for his invitation;and Periander one to all the wise men, to invite them to Corinth to him,after their return from Lydia. Epimenides has an epistle to Solon, toinvite him to Crete, under the tyranny of Pisistratus.''Epimenides often pretended that he rose from death to life.'The above notes are sufficient to shew that he read the ancients withattention, and knew how to select the most curious passages, and mostdeserving the reader's observation.About the year 1711 the Dr. published a piece called the BritishPalladium, or a welcome of lord, Bolingbroke from France. Soon afterthis, Dr. Swift, Dr. Friend, Mr. Prior, with some others of lordBolingbroke's adherents, paid a visit to Dr. King, and brought alongwith them, the key of the Gazetteer's office, together with another keyfor the use of the paper office. The day following this friendly visit,the Dr. entered upon his new post; and two or three days after waited onhis benefactor lord Bolingbroke, then secretary of state.The author of the Doctor's life, published by Curl, has related aninstance of inhumanity in alderman Barber, towards Dr. King. Thismagistrate was then printer of the Gazette, and was so cruel as tooblige the Dr. to sit up till three or four o'clock in the morning,upon those days the Gazette was published, to correct the errors of thepress; which was not the business of the author, but a corrector, who iskept for that purpose in every printing-office of any consequence. Thisslavery the Dr. was not able to bear, and therefore quitted the office.The alderman's severity was the more unwarrantable, as the Dr. had beenvery kind in obliging him, by writing Examiners, and some other papers,gratis, which were of advantage to him as a printer. Those writings atthat juncture made him known to the ministry, who afterwards employedhim in a state paper called the Gazettee.About Midsummer 1712 the Dr. quitted his employ, and retired to agentleman's house on Lambeth side the water; where he had divertedhimself a summer or two before: Here he enjoyed his lov'd tranquility,with a friend, a bottle, and his books; he frequently visited lordClarendon, at Somerset-house, as long as he was able. It was the autumnseason, and the Dr. began insensibly to droop: He shut himself upentirely from his nearest friends, and would not so much as see lordClarendon; who hearing of his weak condition, ordered his sister to goto Lambeth, and fetch him from thence to a lodging he had provided forhim, in the Strand, over against Somerset-house where next dayabout noon he expired, with all the patience, and resignation of aphilosopher, and the true devotion of a christian; but would not bepersuaded to go to rest the night before, till he made such a will, ashe thought would be agreeable to lord Clarendon's inclinations; whoafter his death took care of his funeral. He was decently interred inthe cloisters of Westminster-Abbey, next to his master Dr. Knipe, towhom a little before, he dedicated his Heathen Gods.----The gentlemanalready mentioned, who has transmitted some account of our author toposterity, delineates his character in the following manner. 'He wasa civilian, exquisitely well read; a skillful judge, and among thelearned, an universal scholar, a critic, and an adept; in all sciencesand languages expert; and our English. Ovid, among the poets: Inconversation, he was grave and entertaining, without levity or spleen:As an author, his character may be also summ'd up in the followinglines.'  Read here, in softest sounds the sweetest satire,  A pen dipt deep in gall, a heart good-nature;  An English Ovid, from his birth he seems,  Inspired alike with strong poetic dreams;  The Roman, rants of heroes, gods, and Jove,  The Briton, purely paints the art of love.As a specimen of our author's versification, we shall select a Poem ofhis called, the Art of making Puddings; published in his Miscellanies.  I sing of food, by British nurse design'd,  To make the stripling brave, and maiden kind.  Delay not muse in numbers to rehearse  The pleasures of our life, and sinews of our verse.  Let pudding's dish, most wholsome, be thy theme,  And dip thy swelling plumes in fragrant cream.  Sing then that dim so fitting to improve  A tender modesty, and trembling love;  Swimming in butter of a golden hue,  Garnish'd with drops of Rose's spicy dew.  Sometimes the frugal matron seems in haste,  Nor cares to beat her pudding into paste:  Yet milk in proper skillet she will place,  And gently spice it with a blade of mace;  Then set some careful damsel to look to't;  And still to stir away the bishop's-foot;  For if burnt milk shou'd to the bottom stick,  Like over-heated-zeal, 'twould make folks sick.  Into the Milk her flow'r she gently throws,  As valets now wou'd powder tender beaus:  The liquid forms in hasty mass unite,  Both equally delicious as they're white.  In mining dish the hasty mass is thrown,  And seems to want no graces but its own.  Yet still the housewife brings in fresh supplies,  To gratify the taste, and please the eyes.  She on the surface lumps of butter lays,  Which, melting with the heat, its beams displays;  From whence it causes wonder to behold  A silver soil bedeck'd with streams of gold![Footnote 1: The design of this work, was to ridicule Sir Hans Sloan'swritings, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal-Society; ofwhich Dr. Sloan was secretary. This work, of Dr. King's, which is nowbecome very scarce, is one of the severest and merriest Satires thatever was written in Prose.]       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS SPRAT (Bishop of ROCHESTER)Was descended from a very worthy, though obscure family, being the sonof a private country minister; but his great merit raised him to thateminent station in the church, wherein he long presided, and wasdeservedly accounted one of the most considerable prelates of his time.The Oxford antiquary informs us, that on the 16th of January 1654, hewas entered in Wadham-College, where he pursued his studies with theclosest application, and distinguished himself by his prudent andcourteous behaviour.On the 3d of July 1669, Mr. Sprat took his master of arts degree, andthe same day, commenced doctor in divinity. He had not long been inholy orders, till he was introduced at court, and by a happy power inconversation, so attracted the regard of Charles the IId. that he wasconsidered as a man standing fair for preferment. In 1683, broke out theRye-house Plot, a relation of the particulars of which, Charles the IId.commanded Dr. Sprat to draw up. This the Dr. in a letter to lord Dorset,informs us, he did with great unwillingness, and would have beenimpelled by no other consideration, than that of a royal command. Thereason he executed these orders with so much reluctance, was, becausemany of the most popular men in the nation were either concernedthemselves, or had some relations engaged, so that an account of a plotthus supported, must expose he writer to partial or popular resentments.He requested the king, that he might be permitted to spare some names,and to represent the behaviour of others in as candid a light aspossible, in which request his majesty indulged him; but notwithstandingall the candour he observed, and the most dispassionate representationof facts, yet his composing this relation, was brought against him as acrime, for which an opposite party endeavoured, and had almost effectedhis ruin. This work, tho' finished in the year 1683 was not publishedtill 1685, when it came into the world, under the immediate directionof king James the IId. It was no doubt in consequence of this courtservice, that he was made dean of Westminster, Anno 1683; and bishop ofRochester the year following. Another step he took in the short reign ofking James, likewise exposed him to the resentment of that powerwhich took place at the revolution, which was his sitting in theecclesiastical commission. By this he drew upon himself almost anuniversal censure, which he acknowledges to be just; as appears by aletter he wrote upon that occasion to the earl of Dorset, in the year1689; which thus begins.'My Lord,I think I should be wanting to myself at this time, in my own necessaryvindication, should I forbear any longer to give my friends a trueaccount of my behaviour in the late ecclesiastical commission. Though Iprofess what I now say, I only intend as a reasonable mitigation of theoffence I have given, not entirely to justify my sitting in that court;for which I acknowledge I have deservedly incurred the censure of manygood men; and I wish I may ever be able to make a sufficient amends tomy country for it.'His crime in this particular was somewhat alleviated, by his renouncingthe commission, when he perceived the illegal practices they were goingto put in execution. His offences were strenuously urged against him,and had not the earl of Dorset warmly espoused his interest, he hadprobably been stript of his ecclesiastical preferments. His lordshipcharged the ill-conduct of both these affairs upon king James and hisministry; and thereby brought the bishop's opponents to a perfectreconciliation with him.Notwithstanding this accommodation, such was the inquietude of thetimes, that his lordship had not long enjoyed this tranquility, beforethere was hatched a most villainous contrivance; not only to take awayhis life, but, the lives of archbishop Sancroft, lord Marlborough,and several other persons of honour and distinction; by forging aninstrument under their hands, setting forth, that they had an intentto restore king James, and to seize upon the person of the princess ofOrange, dead or alive; to surprize the tower, to raise a mighty army;and to bring the city of London into subjection. This black conspiracyto murther so many innocent persons, was by the providence of God soondetested; and his lordship drew up, and published an account of it,under this title, A Relation of the Wicked Contrivance of StephenBlackhead, and Robert Young, against the Lives of several Persons, byforging an Association under their Hands. In two parts. The first beinga Relation of what passed at the three Examinations of his Lordship, bya Committee of Lords of the Privy-Council. The second, being an Accountof the two Authors of the Forgery; printed in quarto, in the year 1692.His lordship was honourably acquitted; and he ever after looked uponthis escape, as one of the most remarkable blessings of his life. 'Insuch 'critical times (says he) how little evidence would have sufficedto ruin any man, that had been accused with the least probability oftruth? I do therefore, most solemnly oblige myself, and all mine, tokeep the grateful remembrance of my deliverance, perpetual and sacred.'Hitherto, we have considered Dr. Sprat in his episcopal, and publiccharacter; in which if he fell into some errors, he has a right to ourcandour, as they seem rather to have proceeded from misinformation, andexcess of good-nature, than any malevolent, or selfish principle: Weshall now take a view of him as an author.His first appearance in that sphere, was in the year 1659, when inconcert with Mr. Waller, and Mr. Dryden, he printed a Pindarique Ode,to the Memory of the most renowned Prince, Oliver, Lord Protector, &c.printed in quarto, which he dedicated to the reverend Mr. Wilkin's, thenwarden of Wadham-College; by whose approbation and request, it was madepublic, as the author designed it only for a private amusement. This wasan unfavourable circumstance for our author, as it more particularlyshews the fickleness of his disposition in state-matters, and gave himless credit with those parties he afterwards espoused.His next production in poetry, was an Ode on the Plague of Athens; whichhappened in the second year of the Pelopponesian war, first describedby Thucydides, afterwards by Lucretius: This Mr. Sprat dedicated to hisworthy and learned friend, Dr. Walter Pope. The performance stood thetest of the severest critics; and in the opinion of the best judges, themanner of his great original was judiciously imitated. Soon after this,he proceeded to give the public a specimen of his abilities inanother kind, and succeeded with the greatest applause; which was hisObservations on Monsieur de Serbiere's Voyage into England, written toDr. Wren, professor of astronomy in Oxford; printed in octavo, in theyear 1665.Mr. Sprat in the beginning of his letter acquaints the Dr. with themotives of his engaging with Monsieur Serbiere, 'Having now (says he)under my hands, the history of the Royal-Society, it will be in vain forme to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory ofEngland, if my countrymen shall know, that one who calls himself amember of that society, has escaped unanswered in the public disgraces,which he has cast on our whole nation.'--In this performance Mr. Sprathas given an undeniable proof, that the strength and solidity of anEnglish pen, is infinitely superior to the gallant air of a Frenchauthor, who is sprightly without propriety, and positive without truth.About two years after, 1667, our author published his incomparableHistory of the Royal Society of London, for the improvement of naturalknowledge; a work which has acquired him very great reputation, and hasranked him with the most elegant and polite writers of that age. Soonafter this, Mr. Sprat lost his amiable and much esteemed friend Mr.Abraham Cowley, who by his will recommended to the care of his reverendfriend, the revising of all his works that were printed, and thecollecting of those papers which he had designed for the press. Thistruth Mr. Sprat faithfully discharged, and to the new edition of Mr.Cowley's Works, he prefixed an account of his life and writings,addressed to Mr. Martin Clifford. Happy is it for a good man, when hehas such a friend to close his eyes: This is a desire peculiar to all,and the portion of few to enjoy.  For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd;  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,  Nor cast one longing lingring look behind.  On some warm breast the parting soul relies,  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;  E'en from the tomb, the voice of nature cries,  Awake! and faithful to her wonted fires[1].This life of Cowley, by Dr. Sprat has been esteemed one of the mostelegant compositions in our language; there are several extracts from itin our account of the life of that amiable Poet.These are the most material performances of Dr. Sprat: a man, who wasearly introduced into an elevated station in life, which he held notwithout enemies to his dying moments.

As he may be proposed(considered meerly as a writer) for an example worthy of imitation; soin the character of a dignified clergyman, he has likewise a claim tobe copied in those retired and private virtues, in those acts ofbeneficence and humility, and that unaffected and primitive piety, forwhich he was justly distinguished.[Footnote 1: Elegy in a Country Church-Yard, by Mr. Grey.][Footnote 2: Mr. Cooper, in his ingenious work entitled the Life ofSocrates, speaks in a very
