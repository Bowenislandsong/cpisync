ear!" and then every officergoes behind the line of battle, and the higher the officer's rank,the farther behind he goes. Not because he is any the less brave, butbecause the laws of war require that to be done. If the general cameup on the front line and were killed you would lose your battleanyhow, because he has the plan of the battle in his brain, and mustbe kept in comparative safety. I, with my "shining sword flashing inthe sunlight." Ah! There sat in the hall that day men who had giventhat boy their last hardtack, who had carried him on their backsthrough deep rivers. But some were not there; they had gone down todeath for their country. The speaker mentioned them, but they were butlittle noticed, and yet they had gone down to death for their country,gone down for a cause they believed was right and still believe wasright, though I grant to the other side the same that I ask formyself. Yet these men who had actually died for their country werelittle noticed, and the hero of the hour was this boy. Why was he thehero? Simply because that man fell into that same foolishness. Thisboy was an officer, and those were only private soldiers. I learneda lesson that I will never forget. Greatness consists not in holdingsome office; greatness really consists in doing some great deed withlittle means, in the accomplishment of vast purposes from the privateranks of life; that is true greatness. He who can give to this peoplebetter streets, better homes, better schools, better churches, morereligion, more of happiness, more of God, he that can be a blessing tothe community in which he lives to-night will be great anywhere, buthe who cannot be a blessing where he now lives will never be greatanywhere on the face of God's earth. "We live in deeds, not years, infeeling, not in figures on a dial; in thoughts, not breaths; we shouldcount time by heart throbs, in the cause of right." Bailey says: "Hemost lives who thinks most."If you forget everything I have said to you, do not forget this,because it contains more in two lines than all I have said. Baileysays: "He most lives who thinks most, who feels the noblest, and whoacts the best.""PERSONAL GLIMPSES OF CELEBRATED MEN AND WOMEN."[A][Footnote A: Stenographic report by A. Russell Smith, Sec'y.]When I had been lecturing forty years, which is now four years ago,the Lecture Bureau suggested that before I retire from the publicplatform, that I should prepare one subject and deliver it through thecountry. For I had told the Bureau thirty years ago that when I hadlectured forty years, I would retire. They therefore suggested a talkon this topic, "Personal Glimpses of Celebrated Men and Women." But adeath in our family which destroyed the homeness of our house producedsuch an effect upon us that after the forty years came we found thatwe would rather wander than stay at home, and consequently we aretraveling still, and will do so until the end. This explanation willshow why many of these things are said. For I must necessarily bringmyself often into this topic, sometimes unpleasantly to myself. MarkTwain says, that the trouble with an old man is that he "remembers somany things that ain't so," and with Mark Twain's caution in my ears,I will try to give you these "Personal Glimpses of Celebrated Men andWomen."I do not claim to be a very intimate friend of great men. But a flymay look at an elephant, and for this reason we may glance at thegreat men and women whom I have seen through the many years of publiclife. Sometimes those glimpses give us a better idea of the real manor woman than an entire biography written while he was living woulddo; and to-night as a grandfather would bring his grandchildren to hisknee and tell them of his little experiences, so let me tell to youthese incidents in a life now so largely lived out.As I glance back to the Hampshire Highlands of the dear old BerkshireHills in Massachusetts, where my father worked as a farmer among therooks for twenty years to pay off a mortgage of twelve hundred dollarsupon his little farm, my elder brother and myself slept in the atticwhich had one window in the gable end, composed of four lights andthose very small. I remember that attic so distinctly now, with theears of corn hung by the husks on the bare rafters, the rats runningover the floor and sometimes over the faces of the boys; the patter ofthe rain upon the roof, and the whistle of the wind around that gableend, the sifting of the snows through the hole in the window overthe pillow on our bed. While these things may appear very simple andhomely before this great audience, yet I mention them because in thishouse I had a glimpse of the first great man I ever saw. It was far inthe country, far from the railroad, far from the city, yet intothat region there came occasionally a man or woman whose name is ahousehold word in the world. In those mountains of my boyhood therewas then an "underground railroad" running from Virginia to Canada.It was called an "underground railroad," although it was a systemby which the escaped slaves from Virginia came into Delaware, fromDelaware into Philadelphia, then to New York, then to Springfield, andfrom Springfield my father took the slaves by night to Worthington,Mass., and they were sent on by St. Albans, over the Canada line intoliberty. This "underground railroad" system was composed of a chain ofmen of whom my father was one link. One night my father drove up inthe dark, and my elder brother and I looked out to see who it was hehad! brought home with him. We supposed he had brought a slave whom hewas helping to escape. Oh, those dreary, dark days, when we werein continual dread lest the United States Marshal should arrest myfather, throw him into prison for thus assisting these fugitiveslaves. The gloomy memory of those early years chills me now. But aswe gazed out that dark night, we saw that it was a white man withfather and who helped unhitch the horses and put them in the barn. Inthe morning this white man sat at the breakfast table and my fatherintroduced him to us, saying: "Boys, this is Frederick Douglass, thegreat colored orator," While I looked at him, giggling as boys willdo, Mr. Douglass turned to us and said, "Yes, boys, I am a coloredman; my mother was a colored woman and my father a white man," andsaid he, "I have never seen my father, and I do not know much aboutmy mother. I remember her once when she interfered between me and theoverseer, who was whipping me, and she received the lash upon hercheek and shoulder, and her blood ran across my face. I rememberwashing her blood from my face and clothes." That story made a deepimpression on us boys, stamped indelibly on our memories. FrederickDouglass is thus mentioned to illustrate the subject that I have cometo teach to-night. He frequently came to our house after that and mymother often said to him, "Mr. Douglass, you will work yourself todeath," but he replied that until the slaves were free, and that wouldbe very soon, he must devote his life to them. But after that, saidhe, "I will retire to Rochester, New York, where I have some land andwill build a house." He told us how many rooms it would have, whatdecorations would be there, but when the war had been over severalyears, he came to the house again and my father asked him about thehouse in Rochester. "Well," he said, "I have not built that one yet,but I have my plans for it. I have some work yet to do; I must takecare of the freedmen in the South, and look after their financialprosperity, then I will build my cottage." You all remember that henever built his house, but suddenly went on into the unknown of thegreatest work of his life.I remember that in 1852, my father came with another man who was putfor the night into the northwest bedroom--this is the room where thoseNew Englanders always put their friends, because, perhaps, pneumoniacomes there first--that awful, cold, dismal, northwest bedroom.Thinking a favorite uncle had come, I went to the door early in themorning. The door was shut--one of those doors which, if you liftthe latch, the door immediately swings open. I lifted the latch andprepared to leap in to awaken my uncle and astonish him by my earlymorning greeting. But when the door swung back, I glanced toward thebed. The astonishment chills me at this moment, for in that bed wasnot my uncle; but a giant, whose toes stood up at the foot-board,and whose long hair was spread out over the pillow and his long graywhiskers lay on the bed clothes, and oh, that snore--it sounded likesome steam horn. That giant figure frightened me and I rushed outinto the kitchen and said, "Mother, who is that strange man in thenorthwest bed room?" and she said, "Why, that is John Brown." I hadnever seen John Brown before, although my father had been with himin the wool business in Springfield. I had heard some strange thingsabout John Brown, and the figure of the man made them seem doublyterrible. I hid beside my mother, where I said I would stay until theman was through his breakfast, but father came out and demanded thatthe boys should come in, and he set me right under the wing of thatawful giant. But when John Brown saw us coming in so timidly, heturned to us with a smile so benign and beautiful and so greatly incontrast to what we had pictured him, that it was a transition. Hebecame to us boys one of the loveliest men we ever knew. He would goto the barn with us and milk the cows, pitch the hay from the hay-mow;he drove the cattle to water for us, and told us many a story, untilthe dear, good old man became one of the treasurers of our life. It istrue that my mother thought he was half crazy, and consequently sheand father did not always agree about him, and did not discuss himbefore the children. But nevertheless, be he a crank, or a fanatic,or what he may, one thing is sure, the richest milk of human kindnessflowed from that heart and devoted itself sincerely to the uplift ofhumanity. I remember him with love, love deep and sacred, up to thispresent time. However great an extremist John Brown was, there weremany of them in New England. Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrisonand John Brown never could agree. John Brown used to criticise WendellPhillips severely. He said that Wendell Phillips could not see to readthe clearest signs of revolution, and he was reminded by the husbandwho bought a grave-stone that had been carved for another woman, butthe stone-cutter said "That has the name of another person." "Oh,"said the widower, "that makes no difference; my wife couldn't read."John Brown once said of Wm. Lloyd Garrison that he couldn't see thepoint and was like the woman who never could see a joke. One morning,seated at the breakfast table, her husband cracked a joke, but she didnot smile, when he said, "Mary, you could not see a joke if it werefired at you from a Dalgreen gun," whereupon she remarked: "Now John,you know they do not fire jokes out of a gun." Well do I recall thatDecember 2d of 1859. Only a few weeks before John Brown came to ourhouse and my father subscribed to the purchase of rifles to aid in theattempt to raise the insurrection among the slaves. The last time Isaw John Brown he was in the wagon with my father. Father gave him thereins and came back as though he had forgotten something. John Brownsaid, "Boys, stay at home; stay at home! Now, remember, you may neversee me again," and then in a lower voice, "And I do not think you everwill see me again," but "Remember the advice of your Uncle Brown (aswe called him), and stay at home with the old folks, and rememberthat you will be more blessed here than anywhere else on earth." Thehappiest place on earth for me is still at my old home in Litchfield,Connecticut. I did not understand him then, but on December 2d ateleven o'clock my father called us all into the house and all thathour from eleven to twelve o'clock we sat there in perfect silence. Asthe old clock in that kitchen struck eleven, I heard the bell, ringfrom the Methodist Church, its peal coming up the valley, from hill tohill, and echoing its sad tone as the hour wore on. The peal of thatbell remains with me now; it has ever been a source of inspiration tome. Sixty times struck that old bell. Once a minute, and when thelong sad hour was over, father put his Bible upon the mantel and wentslowly out, and we all solemnly followed, going to our various duties.That solemn hour had a voice in the coming great Civil War of 1861-65.At that hour John Brown was hanged in Virginia. All through NewEngland, they kept that hour with the same solemn services whichcharacterized my father's family. When the call came for volunteersthe young men of New England enlisted in the army, and sang again andagain, that old song, "John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave,but his soul goes marching on." His soul is still marching on. Andwhile I am one of those who would be the first to resist any attemptto mar the sweet fraternity that now characterises the feeling betweenthe North and South, as I believe that the Southern soldier foughtfor what he believed to be right, and consequently is entitled to ourfraternal respect, and while I believe that John Brown was sometimes afanatic, yet this illustration teaches us this great lesson and thatJohn Brown's advice was true. His happiest days were passed far backin the quiet of his old home.Near to our home, in the town of Cummington, lived William CullenBryant, one of the great poets of New England. He came back there tospend his summers among the mountains he so clearly loved. He promisedthe people of Cummington that he would again make his permanent homethere. I remember asking him if he would come clown to the streamwhere he wrote "Thanatopsis" and recite it for us. The good, oldneighbor, white haired and trembling, came down to the banks of thatlittle stream and stood in the shade of the same old maple where hehad written that beautiful poem, and read from the wonderful creationthat made his name famous.  "So live that when thy summons comes, to join  The innumerable caravan which moves  To that mysterious realm where each must take  His chamber in the silent halls of death,  Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,  Scourged to his dungeon; but, sustained and soothed  By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave  Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch  About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.""Yes," he said, "I will come back to Cummington." So he went to Europebut came not back to occupy that home. He loved the old home. We weredriving by his place one day when we saw him planting apple trees inJuly. We all know that apple trees won't grow when planted in July, somy father, knowing him well, called to him and said, "Mr. Bryant, whatare you doing there? They won't grow." Mr. Bryant paused a moment andlooked at us, and then said half playfully: "Conwell, drive on, youhave no part nor lot in this matter. I do not expect these trees togrow; I am setting them out because I want to live over again the dayswhen my father used to set trees when they would grow. I want to renewthat memory." He was wise, for in his work on "The Transmigration ofRaces" he used that experience wonderfully.In 1860, when we were teaching school, my elder brother and myself, inBlanchford, Massachusetts, were asked to go to Brooklyn with the bodyof a lady who died near our schools. We went to Brooklyn on Saturdayand after the funeral, our friends asked us to stay over Sunday,saying that they would take us to hear Henry Ward Beecher! That was agreat inducement, because my father read the "Tribune" every Sundaymorning after his Bible (and sometimes before it) and what Henry WardBeecher said, my father thought, "was law and Gospel." Sunday night,we went to Plymouth Church, and there was a crowd an hour before theservice, and when the doors were opened we were crowded up the stairs.We boys were thrust back into a dirty corner where we could notsee. Oh, yes, that is the way they treat the boys, put them anyplace--they're only boys! I remember the disappointment of that night,when we went there more to see than hear. But finally Mr. Beecher cameout and gave out his text. I remember that I did not pay very muchattention to it. In the middle of the sermon Mr. Beecher began in thestrangest way to auction off a woman: "How much am I offered for thewoman?" he yelled, and while in his biographies, they have said thatthis woman was sold in the Broadway Tabernacle, but I afterwards askedMrs. Beecher and she said that Mr. Beecher had not sold this womantwice, so far as she knew, but that she recalled distinctly the salein the Plymouth Church. I remember standing up on tip-toes to lookfor that woman that was being sold. After he had finished, after thesinging of the hymn, he said "Brethren, be seated," and then said,"Sam, come here." A colored boy came up tremblingly and stood besidehim. "This boy is offered for 770.00; he is owned in South Carolinaand has run away. His master offers him to me for 770.00, and now ifthe officers of the church will pass the plates the boy shall be setfree," and when the plates were returned over 1700.00 came in. As wewent our way home I said to my elder brother: "Oh, what a grand thingit must be to preach to a congregation of fifteen hundred people." Butmy elder brother very wisely said: "You don't know anything about it;you do not know whether he is happy or not." "Well," I suggested,"wasn't it a strange thing to introduce a public auction in the middleof a sermon," and my elder brother again said that if they did moreof that in a country church they would have a larger congregation.Afterwards I was quite fortunate to know Mr. Beecher and frequentlyreported his sermons. I often heard him say that the happiest yearshe ever knew were back in Lawrenceville, Ohio, in that little churchwhere there were no lamps and he had to borrow them himself, lightthem himself, and prepare the church for the first service. He toldhow he swept the church, lighted the fire in the stove, and how itsmoked; then how he sawed the wood to heat the church, and how he wentinto carpenter work to earn money to pay his own salary, yet hesaid that was the happiest time of his life. Mrs. Beecher told meafterwards that Mr. Beecher often talked about those days and saidthat bye and bye he would retire and they would again go back to thesimple life they had enjoyed so much.When he had built his new home near the Hudson, Robert Collier and Ivisited him. We found in the rear of an addition that clap-boards hadbeen put up in all sorts of adjustment. Mr. Collier asked him: "Wheredid you find a carpenter to do such poor work as that?" and Mr.Beecher said humorously: "You could not hire that carpenter on yourhouse." Then he said: "Mr. Collier, I put those boards on that housemyself. I insisted that they leave that work for me to do. I have beenhappy putting on these boards and driving these nails. They took meback to the old days at Lawrenceville, where we lived over a storeand our pantry was a dry goods box. But there we were so happy. I amhoping sometime to be as happy again, but it is not possible to do itwhile I am in the service of the public." He had promised himself andhis wife some day to go back to that simple life. But his sudden deathtaught the same great lesson with all the examples I give of great menand women. Rev. Robt. Collier always enjoyed the circus--the circuswas the great place of enjoyment outside, perhaps, of his pulpit work.It was Robert Collier who used to tell the story of the boy whose auntalways made him go to church, but after going to a circus he wrote tohis aunt: "Auntie, if you had ever been to a circus, you wouldn't goto another prayer-meeting as long as you live." The love of Collierfor the circus only shows the simplicity of the great man's mind. Mr.Collier is said to have paid a dollar for a fifty cent ticket to thecircus, only making it conditional that he was to have the privilegeof going 'round to the rear and crawling under the tent, showing whathe must have done when a boy. The fact of Mr. Collier's love for thecircus was one of the strange things in the eccentricities of a greatman's life. Once Mr. Barnum came into Mr. Collier's church and Mr.Collier said to the usher: "Please show Mr. Barnum to a front seatfor he always gives me one in _his_ circus." These simplicities oftenshow that somewhere back in each man's life there is a point wherehappiness and love are one, and when, that point is passed, we go onlonging to the return.The night after he went to hear Henry Ward Beecher's great sermon theypersuaded us to stay until the following Monday night, because therewas to be a lecture at the Cooper Institute and there was to be aparade of political clubs, and fire works, so as country boys, easilyinfluenced, we decided that the school could wait for another day, andstaid for the procession. We went to Cooper's Institute and therewas a crowd as there was at Beecher's church. We finally got on thestairway and far in the rear of the great crowd, but my brother stoodon the floor, and I sat on the ledge of the window sill, with my feeton his shoulders, so he held me while I told him down there what wasgoing on over yonder. The first man that came on the platform, andpresided at that meeting, was William Cullent Bryant, our dear oldneighbor. When we boys in a strange city saw that familiar face, oh,the emotions that arose in our hearts! How proud we were at that hour,that he, our neighbor, was presiding on that occasion. He took hisseat on the stage, the right of which was left vacant for some one yetto come. Next came a very heavy man, but immediately following hima tall, lean man. Mr. Bryant arose and went toward him, bowing andsmiling. He was an awkward specimen of a man and all about me peoplewere asking "Who is that?" but no man seemed to know. I asked agentleman who that man was, but he said he didn't know. He was anawkward specimen indeed; one of the legs of his trousers was up abouttwo inches above his shoe; his hair was dishevelled and stuck out likerooster's feathers; his coat was altogether too large for him in theback, his arms much longer than the sleeves, and with his legs twistedaround the rungs of the chair, was the picture of embarrassment. WhenMr. Bryant arose to introduce the speaker of that evening, he wasknown seemingly to few in that great hall. Mr. Bryant said: "Gentlemenof New York, you have your favorite son in Mr. Seward and if he wereto be President of the United States, every one of us would be proudof him." Then came great applause. "Ohio has her favorite son in JudgeWade; and the nation would prosper under his administration, butGentlemen of New York, it is a great honor that is conferred upon meto-night, for I can introduce to you the next President of the UnitedStates, Abraham Lincoln." Then through that audience flew the query asto whom Abraham Lincoln was. There was but weak applause. Mr. Lincolnhad in his hand a manuscript. He had written it with great care andexactness and the speech which you read in his biography is the onethat he wrote, not the one that he delivered as I recall it, and it isfortunate for the country that they did print the one that he wrote. Ithink the one he wrote had already been set up in type that afternoonfrom his manuscript, and consequently they did not go over it to seewhether it had been changed or not. He had read three pages and hadgone on to the fourth when he lost his place and then he began totremble and stammer. He then turned it over two or three times, threwthe manuscript upon the table, and, as they say in the west, "lethimself go." Now the stammering man who had created only silentderision up to that point, suddenly flashed out into an angel oforatory and the awkward arms and dishevelled hair were lost sightof entirely in the wonderful beauty and lofty inspiration of thatmagnificent address. The great audience immediately began to followhis thought, and when he uttered that quotation from Douglass, "It iswritten on the sky of America that the slaves shall some day be free,"he had settled the question that he was to be the next Presidentof the United States. The applause was so-great that the buildingtrembled and I felt the windows shake behind me. Afterward, as wewalked home, I said to my elder brother again, "Wasn't it a greatthing to be introduced to all those people as the next President ofthe United States?" and my elder brother very wisely said: "You do notknow whether he was really happy or not." Afterwards, in 1864, whenone of my soldiers was unjustly sentenced and his gray-haired motherplead with me to use what influence I would have with the President, Iwent to Washington and told the story to the President. He said hehad heard something about it from Mr. Stanton, and he said he wouldinvestigate the matter, and he did afterward decide that the manshould not be put to death. At the close of that interview I said tothe President: "I beg your pardon, Mr. Lincoln, but is it not a mostexhausting thing to sit here hearing all these appeals and have all ofthis business on your hands?" He laid his head on his hand, and in asomewhat wearied manner, said, with a deep sigh: "Yes, yes; no manought to be ambitious to be President of the United States," and saidhe, "When this war is over, and that won't be very long, I tell my"Tad" that we will go back to the farm where I was happier as a boywhen I dug potatoes at twenty-five cents a day than I am now; I tellhim I will buy him a mule and a pony and he shall have a little cartand he shall make a little garden in a field all his own," and thePresident's face beamed as he arose from his chair in the delight ofexcitement as he said: "Yes, I will be far happier than I have everbeen here." The next time I looked in the face of Abraham Lincoln wasin the east room of the White House at Washington as he lay in hiscoffin. Not long ago at a Chautauqua lecture I was on the very farmwhich he bought at Salem, Illinois, and looked around the place wherehe had resolved to build a mansion, but which was never constructed.Near my home in the Berkshires, Charles Dudley Warner was born. Whenhe had accomplished great things in literature and had written "MySummer in a Garden," that popular work which attracted the attentionof his newspaper friends, he went to Hartford, where the latter gavehim a banquet. I was invited to attend and report it for the publicpress. They lauded him and said how beautiful it was to be so elevatedabove his fellow men, and how great he was in the estimation of theworld But he in his answer to the toast said, "Gentlemen, I wish forno fame, I desire no glory and you have made a mistake if you thinkI enjoy any such notoriety. I envy the Hartford teacher whose smilethrew sunshine along her pathway." Then he told us the story of a poorlittle boy, cold and barefooted, standing on the street on a terriblycold day. A lady came along, and looking kindly at him, said, "Littleboy, are you cold?" The little fellow, looking up into her face, said,"Yes Ma'am, I was cold till you smiled." He would rather have a smilelike that and the simple love of his fellow men than to have all thefame of the earth. He was honored in all parts of the world by thegreatest of the great, yet he was a sad man when he wrote "My Summerin a Garden," and it all seems a mystery how he could in such griefhave written that remarkable little tale. This sadness is oftenassociated with humorists. Mr. Shaw was one of the saddest men Iever met. Why, he cried on the slightest occasion. I went one day tointerview him in Boston, and Mr. Shepard, his publisher, said "Pleasedon't trouble Josh Billings now." "What is the matter?" "Oh, he iscrying again," said Mr. Shepard. I asked him how Mr. Shaw could writesuch funny things as he did. He then showed me the manuscript (whichMr. Shaw had just placed on his desk and which he had just written),in which he says, "I do not know any cure for laziness, but I haveknown a second wife to hurry it up some." Artemus Ward wrote the mostlaughable things while his heart was in the deepest wretchedness.Often these glimpses of the funny men whose profession would seem toshow them to be the happiest of earth's people, prove that they aresometimes the most gloomy and miserable.John B. Gough, the great temperance orator, the greatest the world hasever seen, said to me one evening at his home that he would lecturefor forty years, and then would stop. But his wife said, "Now, John,you know you won't give it up." He assented, "Yes, I will." But hiswife said, "No you won't. You men when you drink of public life findit like a drink of whiskey, and you are just like the rest of themen." "No," said he. Then Mr. Gough told again his familiar story ofthe minister who was preaching in his pulpit in Boston when he saw theGovernor of the State coming up the aisle. Immediately he began tostammer, and finally said: "I see the Governor coming in, and as Iknow you will want to hear an exhortation from him, I think that I hadbetter stop." Then one of the old officials leaped up from one of thefront seats and said, "I insist upon your going on with your sermon,sir; you ought not be embarrassed by the Governor's coming in. We areall worms! All worms! nothing but worms!" Then the minister wasangry and shouted: "Sir, I would have you understand that there isa difference in worms." Mr. Gough said he was different from otherpeople yet the years came and went, and he stayed on the publicplatform. One night a committee from Frankford, Philadelphia, asked meto write him and ask him to lecture for them. I wrote and whether myinfluence had anything to do with it or not, I do not know, but hecame from New York and when he was in about the middle of his lecture,he came to that sentence, "Young man, keep your record clear, for asingle glass of intoxicating liquor may somewhere, in after years,change into a horrid monster that shall carry you down to woe." Andwhen he had uttered that wonderful sentence of advice, he slopped toget breath, reached for a drink of water, swung forward and fell over.The doctor said he was too late for any earthly aid, and John B.Gough, with his armor on, went on into Glory. He never found thatearthly rest he had promised himself. His garden never showed itsflowers, and his fields were never strewn with grain.When our regiment was encamped in Faneuil Hall at Boston beforeembarking for the war in 1863, Mr. Wendell Phillips sent an invitationto the officers of the regiment to visit his home. But when we reachedhis house we found that he had been called to Worcester suddenly tomake a speech. But we found his wife there in her rolling chair, forshe was a permanent invalid. Our evening was spent very pleasantly,but I said to her: "Are you not very lonesome when Mr. Phillips isaway so much?" "Yes," she said, "I am very lonesome; he is father,mother, brother, sister, husband and child to me," and said she, "hecares for me with the tenderness of a mother; he waits upon me, hetakes me out, and brings me in; he dresses me, and it now seems sostrange that he is not by my side. If it were not for him, I shoulddie, but he says that as soon as the slaves are free that he will comeback and be the same husband he was before." The officers standingaround me smiled as they heard of his promise to retire, but said she,"Oh, yes, he will do as he promised." When the war was over and theslaves were free, and he had scolded General Grant all he wished, hedid do as he promised, and did retire. He sold his house in the cityand bought one in Waverly, Massachusetts. He did prove the exceptionand went back to the private life that he had promised himself andhis wife. Every Sunday morning as I drove by his home I could see himswinging on his gate. It was a double gate over the driveway, and hewould pull that gate far in, get on it and then swing way out over theside-walk and then in again. Well, he used to swing on that gate everySunday morning, and my family wondered why it was that he always didit on that particular morning. One Sunday morning when I drove by,I found Mr. Phillips swinging on his gate over the side-walk, and Isaid, "Mr. Phillips, my family wish me to ask you why you swing onthis gate every Sunday morning." Mr. Phillips, who had a very deepsense of humour, stepped off the gate, stood back, and assuming adignified, ministerial air, "I am requested to discourse to-day uponthe text 'Why I swing upon this gate on Sunday morning,' and I will,therefore, divide my text into two heads." I quickly told him that Imust get to church some time that day. "Then," said he, with a smile,"just one word more: Why do I swing on a gate? Because the first timeI saw my wife she was swinging on the gate, and the second time I sawher, we kissed each other over the top of the gate, and when I swingit reminds me of other happy days long gone by. That, sir, is thereason I swing upon this gate." Then his humor all disappeared and hesaid: "I really swing upon this gate on Sunday morning because I thinkthe next thing to the love of God is love of man for a true woman--asyou cannot say you love God and hate your brother, neither can you sayyou love God unless you have first loved a human being, and I swing onthis gate on Sunday morning because to me it is next to life's highestworship." And then, in a majestic manner, he said, "Conwell, allwithin this gate is PARADISE and all without it MARTYRDOM." In thatwonderful sentence, which I feel sure I recall accurately, he utteredthe most glorious expression that could ever come from uninspiredlips.I had a glimpse of James G. Elaine when I went to his home in Augusta,Maine, to write his biography for the committee. A day or two after itwas finished a distinguished Senator from Washington came to see me inPhiladelphia and asked if Mr. Blaine had seen the book, and I told himthat he certainly had. "Did he see that second chapter?" "Of course hedid," said I; "he corrected it." Then he wanted to know how much moneyit would take to get the book out of circulation. "Why, what is thematter with the book," said I, but he would not tell me, and said thathe would pay me well if I would only keep the book from circulation.He did not tell me what was the matter. I told him that the publishersowned the copyright, having bought it from me. He said, "Is it notpossible for you to take a trip to Europe to-morrow morning?" "But whytake a trip to Europe?" "The committee will pay all of your expenses,all your family's expenses, and of any servants you wish lo take withyou--only get out of the country." "Well," I said, "I am not going toleave the country for my country's good, unless I know what I am goingfor." I never could find out what the trouble with that second chapterwas, and I afterwards asked Mrs. Blaine if she knew what was thematter. She then broke out in a paroxysm of grief and said that if hehad stayed in Washington, Pennsylvania, where he was a teacher, "hewould be living yet." She said "he had given thirty years of his lifeto the public service, and now they have so ungratefully disgraced hisname, sent him to an early grave, and all in consequence of what hehas done for the public. He is a stranger to his country--a strangerto his friends," and then she said, "O would to God he had stayed inPennsylvania!" I left her then, but I have never known what was inthat second chapter that caused the disturbance. But I do knowthe second chapter was concerning their early and happy life inWashington, Pennsylvania, where he taught in the college.Near our home in Newton, Massachusetts, was that of F.F. Smith, whowrote "America." It was of him that Oliver Wendell Holmes said that"Nature tried to hide him by naming him Smith." Smith lived that quietand restful life that reminds one of Tennyson's "Brook" when thinkingof him. He knew the glory of modest living.The last time I saw the sweet Quaker poet, John Greenleaf Whittier,was in Amesbury, before he died. He sent a note to the lecture hallasking me to come to come to him. I asked him what was his favoritepoem of his own writing. He said he had not thought very much aboutit, but said that there was one that he especially remembered:  "I know not where His islands lift     Their fronded palms in air,  I only know I cannot drift     Beyond His love and care."I then asked him, "Mr. Whittier, how could you write all those warsongs which sent us young men to war, and you a peaceful Quaker? Icannot understand it." He smiled and said that his great-grandfather hadbeen on a ship that was attacked by pirates, and as one of the pirateswas climbing up the rope into their ship, his great-grandfathergrasped a knife and cut the rope, saying: "If thee wants the rope,thee can have it." He said that he had inherited something of the samespirit.At Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, Bayard Taylor took me to the grave ofhis wife, and said "Here is the spot where I determined to live anew.From this grave the real experiences of my life began." There he wascompleting his home called "Cedar Croft." But he died while U.S.Minister to Germany. The Young Men's Congress of Boston, whenarranging for a great memorial service in Tremont Temple, asked me tocall on Dr. Oliver Wendel Holmes to ask him to write a poem on BayardTaylor's death. When I asked Mr. Holmes to write this poem, to be readin the Tremont Temple, he was sitting on the rocking chair. He rockedback and kicked up his feet, and began to laugh. "I write a poem onBayard Taylor--ah, no--but I tell you, if you will get Mr. Longfellowto write a poem on Bayard Taylor's death, I will read it." Thesethings only show the eccentricities of Mr. Holmes. So I went to Mr.Longfellow and told him what Dr. Holmes had said, and here is the poemhe wrote:  "Dead he lay among his books!  The peace of God was in his looks.  As the statues in the gloom  Watch o'er Maximilian's tomb,  So those volumes from their shelve.  Watched him, silent as themselves.  Ah, his hand will never more  Turn their storied pages o'er.  Never more his lips repeat  Songs of theirs, however sweet.  Let the lifeless body rest!  He is gone who was its guest.  Gone as travellers haste to leave  An inn, nor tarry until eve.  "Traveller! in what realms afar,  In what planet, in what star,  In what gardens of delight  Rest thy weary feet to-night?  Poet, thou whose latest verse  Was a garland on thy hearse,  Thou hast sung with organ tone  In Deukalion's life thine own.  On the ruins of the Past  Blooms the perfect flower, at last  Friend, but yesterday the bells  Rang for thee their loud farewells;  And to-day they toll for thee,  Lying dead beyond the sea;  Lying dead among thy books;  The peace of God in all thy looks."That great traveller, like Mr. Longfellow, used to tell me of hisfirst wife. He always said that her sweet spirit occupied that roomand stood by him. I often told him that he was wrong and argued withhim, but he said, "I know she is here." I often thought of the greatinspiration she had been to him in his marvelous poems and books.Poor Bayard Taylor, "In what gardens of delight, rest thy weary feetto-night?" Mr. Longfellow once said that Mary "stood between him andhis manuscript," and he could not get away from the impression thatshe was with him all the time. How sad was her early death and how hesuffered the martyrdom of the faithful! Longfellow's home life wasalways beautiful But his later years were disturbed greatly bysouvenir and curiosity seekers.Horace Greeley died of a broken heart because he was not electedPresident of the United States, and never was happy in the last yearsof his life. His idea of true happiness was to go to some quietretreat and publish some little paper. He once declared at a dinner inBrooklyn that he envied the owner of a weekly paper in Indiana whosepaper was so weakly that the subscribers did not miss it if it failedto appear.Mr. Tennyson told me that he would not exchange his home, walled in asit was like a fortress for Windsor Castle or the throne of the Queen.Mr. Carnegie said to me only a few months ago that if a man owned hishome and had his health he had all the money that man needed to be ashappy as any person can be. Mr. Carnegie was right about that.Empress Eugenie, in 1870, was said to be the happiest woman in France.I saw her in the Tuilleres at a gorgeous banquet and a few yearsafter, when her husband had been captured, her son killed and she wasa widow, at the Chislehurst Cottage, I said to her, "The last timeI saw you in that beautiful palace you were said to be the happiestwoman in the world." "Sir," she said, "I am far happier now than I wasthen." It was a statement that for a long time I could not understand.I caught a glimpse of Garibaldi weeping because he did not go backwith his wife, Anita, to South America.I visited Charles Dickens at his home and asked him to come to Americaagain and read from his books, but Mr. Dickens said "No, I will nevercross the ocean; I will not go even to London. When I die, I am to beburied out there on the lawn," and he pointed out the place to me. Afew weeks later I hired a custodian to let me in early at the reargate of Westminster Abbey, for Parliament had changed Mr. Dickens'swill in one respect, and provided that he should not be buried on thelawn of his cottage, but instead in Westminster Abbey, but they madeno other change in his will. There I looked on the fifteen men, allwhom the will allowed to be present at his funeral, who were bearingall that was mortal of Charles Dickens to his rest, and I heard DeanStanley say "While Mr. Dickens lived, his loss was our gain; butnow his gain is our loss." When he uttered that great truth, verycondensed, in that beautiful language, he showed that human life inthe public service of one's fellow men may be nothing more or lessthan continual sacrifice.My friends, if you are called to public service; if you have influencethat you can use for the public good, do not hesitate to go if you areSURE that DUTY calls you. But if, instead, no voice of God, no call ofmankind, doth require that you go out and give up the best of life foryour fellows, remember how fortunate you are. If you can go to yourhome at evening and read your paper in peace, and rest undisturbed,do so, and remember that you have reached the very height of personalhappiness. Then seek no farther, count thyself happy and go no fartherthan God shall call you. For the happiest man is not famous, norrich, but he who hath his loved ones in an undisturbed peace around.Remember what Wendell Phillips said, "All within this gate isParadise; all without it is MARTYDROM."I had a glimpse of Generals Grant and Sheridan wrestling like boys,over a box of cigars sent into General Grant's tent. They were boysagain.I had a glimpse of Li-Hung Chang at Nanking, China, at an execution bybeheading, and a glimpse of him an hour later playing leap frog withhis grandchildren. Childhood was a joy, manhood a tragedy.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Russell H. Conwell, by Agnes Rush Burr*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RUSSELL H.

XIII, NO. 370.] SATURDAY, MAY 16, 1829. [PRICE 2d.LALEHAM PARK:[Illustration: The Residence of the Young Queen of Portugal.]Circumstances, in themselves trivial, often confer celebrity upon placeshitherto of unlettered note. Thus, a beautiful villa at Laleham, a villagein Middlesex, eighteen and a half miles south west of London, has acquiredfrequent passing notice from its having lately become the temporaryresidence of the young "_Queen of Portugal_," whose removal to Englandappears to have been a prudent measure to keep her _petite_ Majesty "outof harm's way."Laleham is delightfully situate on the banks of the Thames, betweenShepperton and Staines, and is famed for the entertainment it affords tothe lovers of angling. The river narrows considerably here; and about theshallows, or gulls, the water is beautifully transparent. The abovetemporary royal residence is built in an elegant villa style; and thegrounds have been very tastefully laid out under the immediate directionof the present proprietor, the Earl of Lucan. They comprise 40 acres, withsome very fine elm timber.The "Young Queen" is described as an interesting and lively child, and iswithin a month of the same age as the Princess Victoria, and Prince Georgeof Cumberland, both of whom were born in May, 1819. She has not theslightest tinge of a tropical complexion; her hair is extremely light, herface pale, her eyes light blue and very sparkling. She is not tall of herage, but remarkably well formed. Her Majesty arrived in London in Octoberlast, and for some time resided at Grillon's Hotel, Albemarle Street; buther health requiring change of air, Laleham was engaged for a short period;although, in allusion to the situation, it was said to be very _low_--aflat joke indeed.In this delightful retreat, the young Queen and her suite at presentreside; and so pacific is our taste, that to enjoy the tranquil sceneryof Laleham, and the sports of the stream that waters its park, we wouldwillingly forego all the cares of state, and leave its plots andcounterplots to more ambitious minds. We could sit by the waters ofLaleham, and sing with the muse of Grongar:  Be full ye courts, be great who will;  Search for peace with all your skill;  Open wide the lofty door,  Seek her on the marble floor;  In vain you search, she is not there;  In vain you search the domes of care!  Grass and flowers Quiet treads,  On the meads and mountain-heads.  Along with Pleasure close ally'd,  Ever by each other's side.But great as may be our content, we hope to see her Majesty speedilyrestored to the bosom of her family, provided she be secure from theperils of her distracted country.There are some allusions to an interesting part of ancient story connectedwith Laleham, Dr. Stukely notices the remains of a Roman encampment onGreenfield Common, within the parish of Laleham, which he supposes to havebeen the camp in which Caesar halted after passing the Thames.       *       *       *       *       *LINES WRITTEN ON VISITING THE ISLAND OF IONA.(_For the Mirror_.)  Wild, sad, and solitary, amid the wave,  Iona mourns her pious founder's grave;  Still o'er his tomb these fretted columns pay  Their crumbling dust, a tribute to his clay.  Frail wreck of time! so crippled with the blast,  Recorder Of the present and the past,  Enough can tell. These Gothic arches show  The height of glory and of human woe;  Alas, 'tis all which occupies the brain,  The lust of power dyes the despot's chain,  Here Learning cast her magic beam around  Light of fair Science, whence our freedom's found,  Resistless spells, attractive power, for long  Brought princes here, and Minstrel's sung their song,  To pay a tribute to the holy sage  Their history told, it formed his faithful page;  Historic power Supreme! within this wall  Gave Bruce the crown, or Baliol the fall,  From proud Edward's grasp in a bark they bore  All Scotland's archives to a distant shore,  Manned by a hardy and a faithful crew,  For Gallia's coast the well skilled pilot drew,  But ere the orphan's eyes had lost the sail  Portending danger, screeching sea gulls wail,  In wild confusion left the angry wave  For distant Staffa's high basaltic cave,  Big heaved the flood, and loud the billows roar  In blackening heaps screened Morvem's distant shore;  High blew the winds, and quick the lightning's flash  And gilded hailstones fell with many a crash.  The story ran from sire to sire.  That Heaven itself was filled with living fire;  Of them no more is told, no more is known,  That widows' tears had scooped this hollow stone.  Here all is silent, save the murmuring sound  Of crystal spray which bathes this sacred ground,  In tuneful sorrow, sheds her friendly tear  To learned virtues, long forgotten here.  When conscience was the punisher of crime,  And blood stained ruffians of Ossian's line  Had taught redemption at the tear-worn shrine,  And barbarous tribes in thousands flocked around  To ask forgiveness on this holy ground.R.       *       *       *       *       *LIGHT AND DARK GENII.(_For the Mirror_.)LIGHT.  In fields of light, I ride, I ride,    Upon the gust-winds back,  And, when I mark the eventide,    Or gathering of the rack;  Like spirit of a pleasant dream,  I mount upon a sunset beam,  And hie me in a flashing stride,  The dark to dash aside,DARK.

JOHNSON.(_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)The correspondent who furnished you with the article on "Dr. Johnson'sResidence in Bolt Court," has fallen into several anachronisms, to which,I beg leave to call your attention.He says, "here the unfortunate Savage has held his intellectual _noctes_,and enlivened the _old moralist_ with his mad philosophy." If you refer toany biographical account of Johnson, you will find, his residence in BoltCourt did not commence till nearly twenty years after the death of Savage.Johnson had no settled habitation till after that event, and they wereboth frequently obliged to perambulate the streets, for whole nights, forwant of money to pay for a lodging; and instead of Johnson being an oldmoralist at this time, he was but thirty-three when his friend died,Savage being about forty-four.Your correspondent has given a graphic description of our greatlexicographer and his two associates, Savage and Boswell, all threeof whom, he says, met at Johnson's house in Bolt Court, and discussedsubjects of polite literature; whereas his acquaintance with Boswell beganonly in 1763, and Savage died in Bristol, in 1742. The work Johnson wrote,at the time of compiling the Dictionary, was the "Rambler," and not the"Guardian," as your correspondent asserts. The latter was the jointproduction of Addison and Steele.The principal events of the Doctor's life are well known; and it isinteresting and not uninstructive to contemplate this master-spiritstruggling with the vicissitudes of fortune, and depending frequently forhis next meal, on the resources of his genius, till his merit becameknown. View him and his cotemporary, Garrick, travelling to Londontogether, mere adventurers, with many plans in their heads, and verylittle money in their pockets; we see them both rising to the pinnacle offame; one the majestic teacher of moral virtue, and the other delightingby the versatility of his histrionic powers. Go one step further. They areconsigned to the tomb, and these men, whom friendship had united whilstliving, death has not divided. Near Shakspeare's monument, in WestminsterAbbey, they lie interred side by side. Of Garrick it has been said, "thatthe gaiety of nations was eclipsed at his death," and of Johnson we maytruly say he has given "ardour to virtue and confidence to truth."HEN. B.       *       *       *       *       *ON GOOD AND EVIL DAYS.(_For the Mirror_.)Notwithstanding the ridicule which in later ages has been deservedlythrown on the idea of _good and evil days_, it is certain, that from timeimmemorial, the most celebrated nations of antiquity, the Chaldeans, theEgyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans, adopted, and placed implicit faithin this superstitious notion, which is still prevalent in all parts of theeast. According to Plutarch, the kings of Egypt never transacted businesson the third day of the week, and abstained even from food till theevening; because on that day, Typhon, who was considered by them the causeof every evil, was born. The seventeenth day of the month was also deemedunfortunate, as on that day Osiris died. The Greeks, too, had theirunlucky days, which they denominated [Greek: apophrades]. The Thursday wasgenerally considered by the Athenians of so unlucky an import, that theassemblies of the people, which happened to fall on that day, were alwaysdeferred. Hesiod enumerated the days when it might be proper to commencecertain undertakings, and those when it was necessary to abstain fromevery employment; among the latter, he mentions the fifth of every month,when the Infernal Furies were supposed to bestride the earth. Virgil hasthe same idea:--      Quintam fuge--pallidus Orcus  Eumenidesque satae: tum partu terra nefando,  Coeumque, lapetumque creat, saevumque Typhaea,  Et conjuratos coelum rescindere fratres.1 GEOR. 279.The Romans also demonstrated in their calendar, the implicit faith theyplaced in this distinction of days. The fortunate days were marked inwhite, and the unfortunate in black; of these were the days immediatelyafter the Calendae, the Nones, and the Ides; the reason was this: in the363rd year from the building of Rome, the military tribunes, perceivingthe republic unsuccessful in war, directed that its cause should beinquired into. The senate having applied to L. Aquinius, he answered,"That when the Romans had fought against the Gauls, near the river Allia,and had experienced so dreadful a defeat, sacrifices had been offered tothe gods the day after the ides of July, and that the Fabii having foughton the same day at Cremera, were all destroyed." On receiving this answer,the senate, by the advice of the pontiffs, ordered, that for the futureno military enterprise should be formed on the days of the calends, thenones, or the ides. Vitellius having taken possession of the sovereignauthority on the 15th of August, and on the same day promulgated somenew laws, they were ill received by the people, because on that day hadhappened the disastrous battles of the Allia and Cremera. There were otherdays esteemed unhappy by the Romans, such as the day of sacrifices to thedead; of the Lemuria; and of the Saturnalia, the 4th before the nones ofOctober; the 6th of the ides of November; the nones of July, calledCaprotinae; the 4th before the nones of August, on account of the defeatat Cannae; and the ides of March, esteemed unlucky by the creatures ofCaesar.In addition to these, were days which every individual consideredfortunate or unfortunate for himself. Augustus never undertook any thingof importance on the day of the nones. Many historical observations havecontributed to favour these superstitious notions. Josephus remarks, thatthe temple of Solomon was burnt by the Babylonians on the 8th ofSeptember, and was a second time destroyed on the same day by Titus.Emilius Protus also observes, that Timoleon, the Corinthian, gained mostof his victories on the anniversary of his birth. To these facts, drawnfrom ancient history, many from more modern times may be added. It issaid, that most of the successes of Charles V. occurred on the festivalof St. Matthew. Henry III. was elected king of Poland, and became kingof France on Whitsunday, which was also his birthday. Pope Sextus V.preferred Wednesday to every other in the week, because it was the day ofhis birth, of his promotion to the cardinalate, of his election to thepapal throne, and of his coronation. Louis XIII. asserted, that Friday wasalways a favourable day to him. Henry VII., of England, was partial toSaturday, on which most of the happy events of his life had taken place.Oliver Cromwell always considered the 3rd of September, 1650, when hedefeated the Scotch at Dunbar; on that day, in the following year, hegained the battle of Worcester, but on the 3rd of September, 1658, heexpired. Though this distinction of good and evil days, be in reality asabsurd as it appears to be, I much doubt if it be yet entirely eradicated.When it is considered how many things concur to keep up an error of thiskind, and that among the great as well as with the vulgar, opinions aspuerile are not only received, but even made a rule of action, it may beinferred, that in every age and in every country, however civilized,superstition always maintains its influence, though it may occasionallyvary in its object or name. The human mind alternately wise and weak,indiscriminately adopts error and truth._Romford_.H.B.A.       *       *       *       *       *THE NOVELIST.       *       *       *       *       *ANNE OF GEIERSTEIN.[The _Literary Gazette_ of Saturday last enables us to present ourreaders, (almost entire) the following Legend respecting the house andancestry of the heroine of Sir Walter Scott's forthcoming Novel--_Anne ofGeierstein_. The tale is entitled Donnerhugel's Narrative, and was told bya remarkable Swiss to the English hero of the Romance.]"I told you, (said Rudolf) that the lords of Arnheim, though fromfather to son they were notoriously addicted to secret studies, were,nevertheless, like the other German nobles, followers of war and thechase. This was peculiarly the case with Anne's maternal grandfather,Herman of Arnheim, who prided himself on possessing a splendid stud ofhorses, and one steed in particular, the noblest ever known in thesecircles in Germany. I should make wild work were I to attempt thedescription of such an animal, so I will content myself with saying hiscolour was jet black, without a hair of white, either on his face or feet.For this reason, and the wildness of his disposition, his master hadtermed him Apollyon; a circumstance which was secretly considered astending to sanction the evil reports which touched the house of Arnheim,being, it was said, the naming of a favourite animal after a foul fiend."It chanced, one November day, that the baron had been hunting in theforest, and did not reach home till night-fall. There were no guests withhim, for, as I hinted to you before, the castle of Arnheim seldom receivedany other than those from whom its inhabitants hoped to gain augmentationof knowledge. The baron was seated alone in his hall, illuminated withcressets and torches. His one hand held a volume covered with charactersunintelligible to all save himself. The other rested on the marble table,on which was placed a flask of Tokay wine. A page stood in respectfulattendance near the bottom of the large and dim apartment, and no soundwas heard save that of the night wind, when it sighed mournfully throughthe rusty coats of mail, and waved the tattered banners which were thetapestry of the feudal hall. At once the footstep of a person was heardascending the stairs in haste and trepidation; the door of the hall wasthrown violently open, and, terrified to a degree of ecstasy, Caspar, thehead of the baron's stable, or his master of horse, stumbled up almost tothe foot of the table at which his lord was seated, with the exclamationin his mouth--'My lord, my lord, a fiend is in the stable!' 'What meansthis folly?' said the baron, arising, surprised and displeased at aninterruption so unusual. 'Let me endure your displeasure,' said Caspar,'if I speak not truth! Apollyon--' Here he paused. 'Speak out, thoufrightened fool,' said the baron; 'is my horse sick, or injured?' Themaster of the stalls again gasped forth the word 'Apollyon!' 'Say on,'said the baron; 'were Apollyon in presence personally, it were nothing toshake a brave man's mind.' 'The devil,' answered the master of the horse,'is in Apollyon's stall!' 'Fool!' exclaimed the nobleman, snatching atorch from the wall; 'what is it that could have turned thy brain in suchsilly fashion?'"As he spoke, he crossed the courtyard of the castle, to visit the statelyrange of stables, where fifty gallant steeds stood in rows, on each sideof the ample hall. At the side of each stall hung the weapons of offenceand defence of a man-at-arms, as bright as constant attention could makethem, together with the buff-coat which formed the trooper's undergarment. The baron, followed by one or two of the domestics, who hadassembled full of astonishment at the unusual alarm, hastened up betwixtthe rows of steeds. As he approached the stall of his favourite horse,which was the uppermost of the right-hand row, the good steed neitherneighed, nor shook his head, nor stamped with his foot, nor gave the usualsigns of joy at his lord's approach; a faint moaning, as if he imploredassistance, was the only acknowledgment of the baron's presence. SirHerman held up the torch, and discovered that there was indeed a tall,dark figure standing in the stall, resting his hand on the horse'sshoulder. 'Who art thou?' said the baron, 'and what dost thou here?' 'Iseek refuge and hospitality,' replied the stranger; 'and I conjure thee togrant it me, by the shoulder of thy horse, and by the edge of thy sword,and so as they may never fail thee when thy need is at the utmost.' 'Thouart, then, a brother of the Sacred Fire,' said Baron Herman of Arnheim;'and I may not refuse thee the refuge which thou requirest of me, afterthe ritual of the Persian Magi. From whom, and for what length of time,dost thou crave my protection?' 'From those,' replied the stranger, 'whoshall arrive in quest of me before the morning cock shall crow, and forthe full space of a year and a day from this period.' 'I may not refusethee,' said the baron, 'consistently with my oath and my honour. For ayear and a day I will be thy pledge, and thou shall share with me roof andchamber, wine and food. But thou, too, must obey the law of Zoroaster,which, as it says, Let the stronger protect the weaker brother, says also,Let the wiser instruct the brother who hath less knowledge. I am thestronger, and thou shalt be safe under my protection; but thou art thewiser, and must instruct me in the more secret mysteries.' 'You mockyour servant,' said the strange visiter; 'but if aught is known toDannischemend which can avail Herman, his instructions shall be as thoseof a father to a son.' 'Come forth, then, from thy place of refuge,' saidthe Baron of Arnheim: 'I swear to thee by the sacred fire which liveswithout terrestrial fuel, and by the fraternity which is betwixt us, andby the shoulder of my horse, and the edge of my good sword, I will be thywarrand for a year and a day, if so far my power shall extend.'"The stranger came forth accordingly; and those who saw the singularity ofhis appearance, scarce wondered at the fears of Caspar, the stall-master,when he found such a person in the stable, by what mode of entrance he wasunable to conceive. When he reached the lighted hall to which the baronconducted him, as he would have done a welcome and honoured guest, thestranger appeared to be very tall, and of a dignified aspect. His dresswas Asiatic, being a long, black caftan, or gown, like that worn byArmenians, and a lofty, square cap, covered with the wool of Astracanlambs. Every article of the dress was black, which gave relief to thelong, white beard that flowed down over his bosom. His gown was fastenedby a sash of black silk net-work, in which, instead of a poniard, orsword, was stuck a silver case, containing writing materials and a roll ofparchment. The only ornament of his apparel consisted in a large ruby ofuncommon brilliancy, which, when he approached the light, seemed to glowwith such liveliness, as if the gem itself had emitted the rays which itonly reflected back. To the offer of refreshment, the stranger replied,'Baron, I may not eat, water shall not moisten my lips, until the avengershall have passed by the threshold.' The baron commanded the lamps to betrimmed and fresh torches to be lighted, and sending his whole householdto rest, remained sealed in the hall along with the stranger, hissuppliant. At midnight, the gates of the castle were shaken as by awhirlwind, and a voice, as if of a herald, was heard to demand his lawfulprisoner, Dannischemend, the son of Hali. The warder then heard a lowerwindow of the hall thrown open, and could distinguish his master's voiceaddressing the person who had thus summoned the castle. But the night wasso dark that he might not see the speakers, and the language which theyused was either entirely foreign, or so largely interspersed with strangewords, that he could not understand a syllable which they said. Scarcefive minutes had elapsed, when he who was without, again elevated hisvoice as before, and said in German, 'For a year and a day, then, Iforbear my forfeiture;--but coming for it when that time shall elapse,I come for my right, and will no longer be withstood.'"From that period Dannischemend, the Persian, was a constant guest atthe castle of Arnheim, and, indeed, never for any purpose crossed thedrawbridge. His amusements, or studies, seemed centred in the library ofthe castle, and in the laboratory, where the baron sometimes toiled inconjunction with him for many hours together. The inhabitants of thecastle could find no fault in the Magus, or Persian, excepting hisapparently dispensing with the ordinances of religion, since he neitherwent to mass nor confession, nor attended upon other religious ceremonies.It was observed that Dannischemend was rigid in paying his devotions,by prostrating himself in the first rays of the rising sun, and that heconstructed a silver lamp of the most beautiful proportions, which heplaced on a pedestal representing a truncated column of marble, havingits base sculptured with hieroglyphical imagery. With what essences hefed this flame was unknown to all, unless perhaps to the baron; but theflame was more steady, pure, and lustrous, than any which was ever seen,excepting the sun of heaven itself, and it was generally believed thatDannischemend made it an object of worship in the absence of that blessedluminary. Nothing else was observed of him, unless that his morals seemedsevere, his gravity extreme, his general mode of life very temperate, andhis fasts and vigils of frequent recurrence. Except on particularoccasions, he spoke to no one of the castle but the baron."Winter was succeeded by spring, summer brought her flowers, and autumnher fruits, which ripened and were fading, when a foot-page, who sometimesattended them in the laboratory to render manual assistance when required,heard the Persian say to the Baron of Arnheim, 'You will do well, my son,to mark my words; for my lessons to you are drawing to an end, and thereis no power on earth which can longer postpone my fate.' 'Alas, mymaster!' said the baron, 'and must I then lose the benefit of yourdirection, just when your guiding hand becomes necessary to place me onthe very pinnacle of the temple of wisdom?' 'Be not discouraged, my son,'answered the sage; 'I will bequeath the task of perfecting you in yourstudies to my daughter, who will come hither on purpose. But remember, ifyou value the permanence of your family, look not upon her as aught elsethan a helpmate in your studies; for if you forget the instructress in thebeauty of the maiden, you will be buried with your sword and your shield,as the last male of your house; and farther evil, believe me, will arise;for such alliances never come to a happy issue, of which my own is anexample.--But, hush, we are observed.' The household of the castle ofArnheim having but few things to interest them, were the more eagerobservers of those which came under their notice; and when the terminationof the period when the Persian was to receive shelter in the castle beganto approach, some of the inmates, under various pretexts, but whichresolved into every terror, absconded,--while others held themselves inexpectation of some striking and terrible catastrophe. None such, however,took place; and, on the expected anniversary, long ere the witching hourof midnight, Dannischemend terminated his visit in the castle of Arnheim,by riding away from the gate in the guise of an ordinary traveller."The baron had meantime taken leave of his tutor with many marks ofregret, and some which amounted even to sorrow. The sage Persian comfortedhim by a long whisper, of which the last part only was heard, 'By thefirst beam of sunshine she will be with you. Be kind to her, but not overkind.' He then departed, and was never again seen or heard of in thevicinity of Arnheim. The baron was observed during all the day after thedeparture of the stranger to be particularly melancholy. At dawn of theensuing morning, Sir Herman summoned his page; and having performed histoilet, he waited till the sun had just appeared above the horizon, and,taking from the table the key of the laboratory, which the page believedmust have lain there all night, he walked thither, followed by hisattendant. At the door the baron made a pause, and seemed at one time todoubt whether he should not send away the page, at another to hesitatewhether he should open the door, as one might do who expected some strangesight within. He pulled up resolution, however, turned the key, threw thedoor open, and entered. The page followed close behind his master, and wasastonished to the point of extreme terror at what he beheld, although thesight, however extraordinary, had in it nothing save what was agreeableand lovely. The silver lamp was extinguished, or removed from itspedestal, where stood in place of it a most beautiful female figure in thePersian costume, in which the colour of pink predominated. But she woreno turban, or head-dress of any kind, saving a blue riband drawn throughher auburn hair and secured by a gold clasp, the outer side of which wasornamented by a superb opal, which, amid the changing lights peculiarto that gem, displayed a slight tinge of red, like a spark of fire.The figure of this young person was rather under the middle size, butperfectly well formed; the eastern dress, with the wide trousers gatheredround the ankles, made visible the smallest and most beautiful feet whichhad ever been seen, while hands and arms of the most perfect symmetrywere partly seen from under the folds of the robe. The little lady'scountenance was of a lively and expressive character, in which spirit andwit seemed to predominate; and the quick, dark eye, with its beautifullyformed eyebrow, seemed to presage the arch remark, to which the rosy andhalf-smiling lip appeared ready to give utterance. The pedestal on whichshe stood, or rather was perched, would have appeared unsafe had anyfigure heavier than her own been placed there. But, however she had beentransported thither, she seemed to rest on it as lightly and safely as alinnet, when it has dropped from the sky on the tendril of a rose-bud. Thefirst beam of the rising sun, falling through a window directly oppositeto the pedestal, increased the effect of this beautiful figure, whichremained as motionless as if it had been carved in marble. She onlyexpressed her sense of the Baron of Arnheim's presence by something of aquicker respiration, and a deep blush, accompanied by a slight smile."The Baron of Arnheim, for an instant, stood without breath or motion.At once, however, he seemed to recollect that it was his duty to welcomethe fair stranger to his castle, and to relieve her from her precarioussituation. He stepped forward accordingly with the words of welcome on histongue, and was extending his arms to lift her from the pedestal, whichwas nearly six feet high; but the light and active stranger merelyaccepted the support of his hand, and descended on the floor as light andas safe as if she had been formed of gossamer. It was, indeed, only by themomentary pressure of her little hand, that the Baron of Arnheim was madesensible that he had to do with a being of flesh and blood. 'I am come asI have been commanded,' she said, looking around her: 'you must expect astrict and diligent mistress, and I hope for the credit of an attentivepupil.' After the arrival of this singular and interesting being in thecastle of Arnheim, various alterations took place within the interior ofthe household. A lady of high rank and small fortune, the respectablewidow of a count of the empire, who was the baron's blood relation,received and accepted an invitation to preside over her kinsman's domesticaffairs, and remove, by her countenance, any suspicions which might arisefrom the presence of Hermione, as the beautiful Persian was generallycalled. The countess Waldstetten carried her complaisance so far, as tobe present on almost all occasions, whether in the laboratory or library,when the Baron of Arnheim received lessons from, or pursued studies with,the young and lovely tutor, who had been thus strangely substituted forthe aged Magus. If this lady's report was to be trusted, their pursuitswere of a most extraordinary nature, and the results which she sometimeswitnessed were such as to create fear as well as surprise. But sheaccordingly vindicated them from practising unlawful arts, or oversteppingthe boundaries of natural science. A better judge of such matters, theBishop of Bamberg himself, made a visit to Arnheim, on purpose to witnessthe wisdom of which so much was reported through the whole Rhine country.He conversed with Hermione, and found her deeply impressed with the truthsof religion, and so perfectly acquainted with its doctrines, that hecompared her to a doctor of theology in the dress of an Easterndancing-girl. When asked regarding her knowledge of languages and science,he answered that he had been attracted to Arnheim by the most extravagantreports on these points, but that he must return confessing 'the halfthereof had not been told unto him.'"Meantime a marked alteration began to take place in the interviewsbetween the lovely tutor and her pupil. These were conducted with the samecaution as before, and never, so far as could be observed, took placewithout the presence of the countess of Waldstetten, or some other thirdperson of respectability. But the scenes of these meetings were no longerthe scholar's library, or the chemist's laboratory;--the gardens, thegroves, were resorted to for amusement, and parties of hunting andfishing, with evenings spent in the dance, seemed to announce that thestudies of wisdom were for a time abandoned for the pursuits of pleasure.It was not difficult to guess the meaning of this; the Baron of Arnheimand his fair guest, speaking a language different from all others, couldenjoy their private conversation, even amid all the tumult of gaietyaround them; and no one was surprised to hear it formally announced, aftera few weeks of gaiety, that the fair Persian was to be wedded to the Baronof Arnheim."The manners of this fascinating young person were so pleasing, herconversation so animated, her wit so keen, yet so well tempered with goodnature and modesty, that, notwithstanding her unknown origin, her highfortune attracted less envy than might have been expected in a case sosingular. Above all, her generosity amazed and won the hearts of all theyoung persons who approached her. These good qualities, her liberalityabove all, together with a simplicity of thought and character, whichformed a beautiful contrast to the depth of acquired knowledge which shewas well-known to possess,--these, and her total want of ostentation, madeher superiority be pardoned among her companions. Still there was noticetaken of some peculiarities, exaggerated perhaps by envy, which seemed todraw a mystical distinction between the beautiful Hermione and the meremortals with whom she lived and conversed. In the merry dance she was sounrivalled in lightness and agility, that her performance seemed that ofan aerial being. She could, without suffering from her exertion, continuethe pleasure till she had tired out the most active revellers; and eventhe young Duke of Hochspringen, who was reckoned the most indefatigable atthat exercise in Germany, having been her partner for half an hour, wascompelled to break off the dance and throw himself, totally exhausted,on a couch, exclaiming he had been dancing not with a woman, but with an_ignis fatuus_. Other whispers averred, that while she played with heryoung companions in the labyrinth and mazes of the castle gardens athide-and-seek, or similar games of activity, she became animated with thesame supernatural alertness which was supposed to inspire her in thedance. She appeared amongst her companions, and vanished from them witha degree of rapidity which was inconceivable; and hedges, treillage, orsuch like obstructions, were surmounted by her in a manner which the mostvigilant eye could not detect; for, after being observed on the other sideof the barrier at one instant, in another she was beheld close beside thespectator. In such moments, when her eyes sparkled, her cheeks reddened,and her whole frame became animated, it was pretended that the opal claspamid her tresses, the ornament which she never laid aside, shot forth thelittle spark, or tongue of flame, which it always displayed, with anincreased vivacity. In the same manner, if in the twilight hall theconversation of Hermione became unusually animated, it was believed thatthe jewel became brilliant, and even displayed a twinkling and flashinggleam which seemed to be emitted by the gem itself, and not produced inthe usual manner, by the reflection of some external light. Her maidenswere also heard to surmise, that when their mistress was agitated by anyhasty or brief resentment (the only weakness of temper which she was everobserved to display,) they could observe dark-red sparks flash from themystic brooch, as if it sympathized with the wearer's emotions. The womenwho attended on her toilette farther reported, that this gem was neverremoved but for a few minutes, when the baroness' hair was combed out;that she was unusually pensive and silent during the time it was laidaside, and particularly apprehensive when any liquid was brought near it.Even in the use of holy water at the door of the church, she was observedto omit the sign of the cross on the forehead, for fear, it was supposed,of the water touching the valued jewel."These singular reports did not prevent the marriage of the Baron ofArnheim from proceeding as had been arranged. In the course of twelvemonths the lovely baroness presented her husband with a daughter, whichwas to be christened Sibylla, after the count's mother. As the health ofthe child was excellent, the ceremony was postponed till the recovery ofthe mother from her confinement; many were invited to be present on theoccasion, and the castle was thronged with company. It happened thatamongst the guests was an old lady, notorious for playing in privatesociety the part of a malicious fairy in a minstrel's tale. T
