em come in. TheTree was quite beautiful, all white candles--quantities--shinyornaments and small toys, dolls, trumpets, drums, and the yellow andred bags of "dragees" hanging on the branches. It went straight up tothe ceiling, and quite on top was a big gold star, the manufacture ofwhich had been a source of great tribulation at the chateau. We forgotto get one in Paris, and sent in hot haste on Wednesday to La Fertefor pasteboard and gold paper; but, alas! none of us could draw, andwe had no model. I made one or two attempts, with anything but asatisfactory result: all the points were of different lengths andthere was nothing but points (more like an octopus than anythingelse). However, Pauline finally produced a very good one (it reallylooked like a star), and of course the covering it with gold paper waseasy. The creche made a great effect, standing at the bottom of theTree with a tall candle on each side. All the big toys and clotheswere put on a table behind, where we all sat. Then the door wasopened; there was a rush at first, but the school-mistress kept strictorder. The little ones came first, their eyes round and fixed on thebeautiful Tree; then the bigger children, and immediately behind themthe "oldest inhabitants"--such a collection of old, bent, wrinkled,crippled creatures--then as many as could get in. There wasn't a soundat first, except some very small babies crowing and choking--then asort of hum of pleasure.[Illustration: All the children in procession passed.]We had two or three recitations in parts from the older scholars; somesongs, and at the end the "compliment," the usual thing--"Madame etchere Bienfaitrice," said by a small thing about five years old,speaking very fast and low, trying to look at me, but turning her headalways toward the Tree and being shaken back into her place by MadameIsidore. Then we began the distribution--the clothes first, so as not todespoil the Tree too soon. The children naturally didn't take theslightest interest in warm petticoats or tricots, but their mothers did.We had the little ones first, Francis giving to the girls and Alice tothe boys. Henrietta called the names; Pauline gave the toys to our two,and Madame Isidore called up each child. The faces of the children, whenthey saw dolls, trumpets, etc., being taken off the Tree and handed toeach of them, was a thing to remember. The little girls with their dollswere too sweet, hugging them tight in their little fat arms. One or twoof the boys began to blow softly on the trumpets and beat the drums, andwere instantly hushed up by the parents; but we said they might make asmuch noise as they pleased for a few moments, and a fine "vacarme" (row)it was--the heavy boots of the boys contributing well as they movedabout after their trains, marbles, etc.However, the candles were burning low (they only just last an hour) andwe thought it was time for cakes and wine. We asked the children if theywere pleased, also if each child had garment, toy, and "dragees," and tohold them up. There was a great scamper to the mothers to get theclothes, and then all the arms went up with their precious load.The school-children passed first into the outer room, where the keepers'wives and our maids were presiding over two great bowls of hot wine(with a great deal of water, naturally) and a large tray filled withbrioches. When each child had had a drink and a cake they went out, tomake room for the outsiders and old people. Henrietta and Paulinedistributed the "extras"; I think there were about twenty in all,counting the babies in arms--also, of course, the girls from La Fertewho had come over with the Sisters to sing. I talked to some of the oldpeople. There was one poor old woman--looked a hundred--still gazingspellbound at the Tree with the candles dying out, and most of theornaments taken off. As I came up to her she said: "Je suis bienvieille, mais je n'aurais jamais cru voir quelque chose de si beau! Ilme semble que le ciel est ouvert"--poor old thing! I am so glad I wasn'tsensible, and decided to give them something pretty to look at and thinkabout. There was wine and cakes for all, and then came the closingceremony.We (the quality) adjourned to the sitting-room of the school-mistress(where there were red arm-chairs and a piano), who produced a bottle ofbetter wine, and then we "trinqued" (touched glasses) with the Mayor,who thanked us in the name of the commune for the beautiful fete we hadmade for them. I answered briefly that I was quite happy to see them sohappy, and then we all made a rush for wraps and carriages.The Abbe came back to the chateau to dine, but he couldn't get awayuntil he had seen his Sisters and harmonium packed safely into the bigomnibus and started for La Ferte. It looked so pretty all the way home.It was quite dark, and the various groups were struggling down the hilland along the road, their lanterns making a bright spot on the snow;the little childish voices talking, laughing, and little bands runningbackward and forward, some disappearing at a turn of the road, thelantern getting dimmer, and finally vanishing behind the trees. We wentvery slowly, as the roads were dreadfully slippery, and had a runningescort all the way to the Mill of Bourneville, with an accompaniment ofdrums and trumpets. The melancholy plains of the Valois were transformedtonight. In every direction we saw little twinkling lights, as thevarious bands separated and struck off across the fields to some lonelyfarm or mill. It is a lonely, desolate country--all great stretches offields and plains, with a far-away blue line of forests. We often drivefor miles without meeting a vehicle of any kind, and there are suchdistances between the little hamlets and isolated farms that one isalmost uncomfortable in the absolute solitude. In winter no one isworking in the fields and one never hears a sound; a dog's bark iswelcome--it means life and movement somewhere.[Illustration: There was some poor old woman still gazing spellbound.]It is quite the country of the "haute culture," which Cherbuliez wroteabout in his famous novel, "La Ferme du Choquart." The farms are oftenmost picturesque--have been "abbayes" and monasteries. The massive roundtowers, great gate-ways, and arched windows still remain;occasionally, too, parts of a solid wall. There is a fine oldruin--the "Commanderie," near Montigny, one of our poor little villages.It belonged to the Knights Templars, and is most interesting. The chapelwalls are still intact, and the beautiful roof and high, narrow windows.It is now, alas! a "poulailler" (chicken-house), and turkeys andchickens are perched on the rafters and great beams that still supportthe roof. The dwelling-house, too, is most interesting with its thickgray walls, high narrow windows, and steep winding staircase. I wasalways told there were "donjons" in the cellars, but I never had thecourage to go down the dark, damp, slippery staircase.We were quite glad to get back to our big drawing-room with the fire andthe tea-table; for of course the drawback to our entertainment was thestuffiness (not to say bad smell) of the little room. When all thechildren and grown people got inmost of them with damp clothes andshoes-the odour was something awful. Of course no window could be openedon account of the candles, and the atmosphere was terrible. At the end,when it was complicated with wine and cake and all the little ones'faces smeared with chocolate and "dragees," I really don't know how westood it.We had a very cheerful dinner. We complimented the Abbe upon his sermon,which was really very pretty and poetical. He said the children's facesquite inspired him, and beyond, over their heads, through the open doorhe got a glimpse of the tall pines with their frosted heads, and couldalmost fancy he saw the beautiful star.We were all much pleased with our first "Christmas in the Valois."VIIA RACINE CELEBRATIONMAREUIL-SUR-OURCQ, April 20th, 1899.I could scarcely believe I was in our quiet little town of LaFerte-Milon to-day. Such a transformation--flags flying, draperies atall the windows, garlands of greens and flowers across the streets, anda fine triumphal arch--all greens and flowers arranged about the centreof the Grande Rue. Many people standing about, looking on, and makingsuggestions; altogether, an air de fete which is most unusual in thesesleepy little streets where nothing ever passes, except at four o'clock,when the three schools come out, and clatter down the street. The EcoleMaternelle comes first, the good Mere Cecile bringing up the rear of theprocession, holding the smallest children, babies three and four yearsold, by the hand, three or four more clinging to her skirts, and guidingthem across the perilous passage of the bridge over the canal. It is apretty view from the bridge. The canal (really the river Ourcq,canalisee), which has preserved its current and hasn't the dead,sluggish look of most canals, runs alongside of the Mail, a large greenplace with grass, big trees, a broad walk down the centre, and benchesunder the trees. It is a sort of promenade for the inhabitants and alsoserves as a village green, where all the fairs, shows and markets areheld. The opposite bank is bordered by quaint old houses, with roundtowers and gardens, full of bright flowers, running down to the water'sedge. There is one curious old colombier which has been there forcenturies; near the bridge there is a lavoir, where there are alwayswomen washing. They are all there to-day, but much distracted, wildlyinterested in all that is going on--and the unwonted stir in thestreets; chattering hard, and giving their opinions as to the decorationof the arch, which is evidently a source of great pride to the town.On a bright sunny day, when the red roofs and flowers are reflected inthe water, and it is not too cold, their work doesn't seem very hard;but on a winter afternoon, when they have to break the ice sometimes,and a biting wind is blowing down the canal, it is pitiable to see thepoor things thinly clad, shivering and damp; their hands and arms redand chapped with cold. On the other side of the bridge, the canalwanders peacefully along through endless green meadows, bordered withpoplars, to Marolles, a little village where there is the first ecluseon the way to Paris.We had been talking vaguely all winter of doing something at LaFerte-Milon to feter the bicentenaire of Racine. They were makingpreparations at Paris, also at Port Royal, and it seemed hard to donothing in his native place. His statue in the Grande Rue is one of theglories of La Ferte.Jean Racine was born in La Ferte in 1639. He lost both father and motheryoung, and was brought up by his grandparents. He was sent first toschool at Beauvais, later, while still quite a youth, to Port Royal. Hisstay there influenced considerably his character and his writings; andthough he separated himself entirely from the "Solitaires" during theyears of his brilliant career as poet and courtier, there remainedalways in his heart a latent tenderness for the quiet green valley ofthe Chevreuse, where he had passed all his years of adolescence,listening to the good Fathers, and imbibing their doctrines of thenecessity of divine grace to complete the character. His masters werehorrified and distressed when his talent developed into plays, whichbrought him into contact with actors and actresses, and made him anhabitue of a frivolous Court.There is a pretty letter from one of his aunts, a religieuse de PortRoyal, begging him to keep away from "des frequentations abominables,"and to return to a Christian life.His career was rapid and brilliant. He was named to the AcademieFrancaise in 1673, and when he retired from the theatre was a welcomeand honoured guest at the most brilliant court of the world. He was madeprivate historian to the King and accompanied him on various campaigns.There are amusing mentions of the poets-historians (Boileau was alsoroyal historian) in the writings of their contemporaries, "les messieursdu sublime," much embarrassed with their military accoutrements and muchfatigued by the unwonted exercise and long days on horseback. The Kingshowed Racine every favour. He was lodged at Versailles and at Marly andwas called upon to amuse and distract the monarch when the cares ofstate and increasing years made all diversions pall upon him. He saw thedecline and disgrace of Madame de Montespan, the marvellous good fortuneof Madame de Maintenon. His famous tragedies of Esther and Athalie werewritten at Madame de Maintenon's request for her special institution ofSt. Cyr, and the performances were honoured by the presence of the King.Racine himself directed the rehearsals and the music was composed byJean Baptiste Moreau, organist of St. Cyr. The youthful actresses showedwonderful aptitude in interpreting the passionate, tender verses of thepoet. Young imaginations worked and jealousies and rivalries ran high.After a certain number of representations Mme. de Maintenon was obligedto suspend the performances in public, with costumes and music. Theplays were only given in private at the Maison de St. Cyr; the youngscholars playing in the dress of the establishment. He made his peacewith Port Royal before he died. He submitted Phedre to his formermasters and had the satisfaction of being received again by the "GrandArnauld,"[10] who had been deeply offended by his ingratitude and hiscriticisms and ridicule of many of his early friends and protectors. Heasked to be buried there, and his body remained until the destructionand devastation of Port Royal, when it was removed to Paris and placedin the Church of St. Etienne des Monts.[10] "Le Grand Arnauld" (Antoine), one of the first and mostinfluential of the celebrated "Solitaires" who established themselvesat Port Royal, and one of the founders of the famous sect ofJansenists whose controversies with the Jesuits convulsed the wholereligious world in France during the years 1662-1668. He was followedin his retreat by his mother (after the husband's death), his brotherand four sisters, one of whom became the "Mere Angelique," Abbesse ofPort Royal.He returned many times to La Ferte-Milon, and the great poet andprivate historian of the Roi Soleil must often have climbed the steeplittle street that leads to the ruins, and thought of the changes, sincethe little boy lay on the grass at the foot of the great walls, dreaminggolden dreams of the future, which for him were so brilliantly realised.In a small country town one is slow to adopt new ideas, slower still tocarry them out, but the Mayor and cure were both most anxious to dosomething in the birthplace of the poet, and that was the generalfeeling in the Department. After many discussions we finally arrived ata solution, or at least we decided what we wanted: a special service inthe fine old church of Notre Dame, which stands beautifully on the hill,close to the ruins; a representation of the Comedie Francaise, and ofcourse a banquet at the Sauvage, with all the official world, senators,Prefet, Academiciens--a band of music, a torch-light procession, and asmany distinguished visitors as we could get hold of. _Funds_ of coursewere a necessary item, but all the countryside contributed largely, andwe knew that the artists would give their services gratis.We arranged a breakfast at my house in Paris with Mons. Casimir-Perier,late President of the Republic, who was always ready to lend hisinfluence for anything that interests the people, and teaches themsomething of their great men, and Mons. Claretie, Directeur of theComedie Francaise, a most cultivated, charming man. He is generallyrather chary of letting his pensionnaires play en province, but thisreally was an occasion to break through his rules, and he was quiteready to help us in every way. We had also M. Sebline, Senator of theAisne, and l'Abbe Marechal, cure of La Ferte-Milon. We had wanted one ofthe Administrateurs of the Chemin de Fer du Nord to arrange about a freetransport for the actors, but there seemed some trouble about gettinghold of the right man, and Sebline promised to see about that.The Abbe Marechal and I were very ambitious for the theatrical part ofthe entertainment and had views of Esther with the costumes, andchoruses of Moreau, but M. Claretie said that would be impossible. Itwas difficult enough to arrange in Paris with all the singers,instruments, and costumes at hand--and would be impossible in thecountry with our modest resources. I think the idea of a tent on avillage green rather frightened him; and he didn't quite see the eliteof his company playing in such a cadre--no decor--and probably very badacoustics. However, Sebline reassured him. He knew the tent and itscapabilities, having seen it figure on various occasions, comicesagricoles, banquets de pompiers, at village fetes generally, and said itcould be arranged quite well.We discussed many programmes, but finally accepted whatever M. Claretiewould give--an act of "Les Plaideurs," and two or three of "Berenice,"with Mme. Bartet, who is charming in that role. The Abbe Marechalundertook the music in his church, and I was sure he would succeed inhaving some of the choruses of Esther. His heart was quite set on it.Once he had settled our programme, the conversation drifted away fromthe purely local talk, and was brilliant enough. All the men were cleverand good talkers, and all well up in Racine, his career, and the variousphases of his work.From the classics we got into modern plays and poets, and there ofcourse the differences of opinion were wide; but I think the generalpublic (people in the upper galleries) like better when they go to theFrancaise to see a classic piece--Roman emperors and soldiers, andvestal virgins and barbarians in chains--and to listen to their longtirades. The modern light comedy, even when it treats of the vitalsubjects of the day, seems less in its place in those old walls. I quiteunderstand one couldn't see Britannicus,[11] Mithridate, nor the Cidevery evening.[11] I remember so well our cousin Arthur's description of hisholidays spent at his grandmother's chateau. Every evening they readaloud some classical piece. When he had read Britannicus twice (thesecond time to appreciate more fully the beauties which were lightlypassed over at first), he rebelled, had a migraine, or a sore throat,something which prevented his appearing in the drawing-room afterdinner; and he and his cousins attired themselves in sheets, and stoodon the corner of the wall where the diligence made a sharp turn,frightening the driver and his horses out of their wits.We came down here several times to see how things were getting on, andalways found the little town quite feverishly animated. We had succeededin getting the band of the regiment stationed at Soissons. I wrote tothe Colonel, who said he would send it with pleasure, but that hecouldn't on his own authority. An application must be made to theMinistere de la Guerre. There is always so much red tape in France. Onewrites and receives so many letters about anything one wants to do--aChristmas Tree in the school-house--a distribution of soup for the poorand old--a turn in a road to be rounded, etc. However, the permissionwas graciously accorded for the band. The Mayor's idea was to station iton the Mail, where quantities of people would congregate who couldn'tget into the church or the tent.We went one day to have tea with the Abbe Marechal in his nice oldpresbytere; the salon opening out on a large, old-fashioned garden withfine trees, and a view of the church towers in the distance. He wasquite pleased with all that he had arranged for his church service. Oneof his friends, Abbe Vignon, a most interesting man and eloquentpreacher, promised to deliver a lecture on Racine from the pulpit; andM. Vincent d'Indy, the distinguished composer and leader of the modernschool of music, undertook the music with Mme. Jeanne Maunay as singer;he himself presiding at the organ.I tried to persuade the proprietors of all the chateaux in theneighbourhood to come, but I can't say I had much success. Some hadgout--some had mourning. I don't remember if any one "had married a wifeand therefore couldn't come."However, we shall fill our own house, and give breakfast and dinner toany one who will come. To-day we have been wandering about on the greennear the ruins, trying to find some place where we can give our friendstea. The service in the church will certainly be long, and before thetheatrical performance begins we should like to arrange a littlegouter--but where? It is too far to go back to our house, and theSauvage, our usual resort, will be packed on that day, and quite off itshead, as they have two banquets morning and evening. The "Cafe desRuines," a dirty little place just under the great walls of the chateau,didn't look inviting; but there was literally nothing else, so weinterviewed the proprietor, went in to the big room down stairs, whichwas perfectly impossible, reeking with smoke, and smelling of cheapliquor; but he told us he had a "tres belle salle" up stairs, where weshould be quite alone. We climbed up a dark, rickety little turningstaircase, and found ourselves in quite a good room, with three largewindows on the green; the walls covered with pictures from the cheapillustrated papers, and on the whole not too dirty. We have taken it forthe afternoon, told the patron we would come to-morrow, put up tables,and make as many preparations as we could for the great day. He was veryanxious to furnish something--some "vin du pays;" but we told him all wewanted was fire, plenty of hot water, and a good scrubbing of floor andwindows.It is enchanting this afternoon. We are taking advantage of the fineweather to drive about the country, and show our friends some of our bigfarms and quaint little villages. They look exactly as they did ahundred years ago, "when the Cossacks were here," as they say in thecountry. Some of the inns have still kept their old-fashioned signs andnames. Near May, on the road to Meaux, Bossuet's fine old cathedraltown, there is a nice old square red-brick house, "L'Auberge du Veau quiTete" (The Inn of the Sucking Calf), which certainly indicates that thisis great farming country. There are quantities of big white oxen, cows,and horses in the fields, but the roads are solitary. One never meetsanything except on market day. The Florians who live in Seine et Marne,which is thickly populated--villages and chateaux close together--weremuch struck with the loneliness and great stretches of wood and plain.We are praying for fine weather, as rain would be disastrous. The mainstreet looks really charming. The green arch is nearly finished, and atnight, when everything is illuminated, will be most effective.22nd. It rained yesterday afternoon and all night--not light Aprilshowers, but a good, steady downpour. Francis and Ctesse. de Gontautarrived from Paris in his little open automobile. Such a limp, draggledfemale as emerged from the little carriage I never saw. They had hadsome sharp showers; pannes (breakdowns), too, and she _says_ she pushedthe carriage up all the hills. She didn't seem either tired or cross,and looked quite bright and rested when she reappeared at dinner.Various friends arrived this morning, and we have been in La Ferte allthe afternoon. The draperies and festoons of flowers don't look any theworse for the heavy rain, and at least it is over, and we shall probablyhave sun to-morrow. The tent is up on the green, and looks fairly large.I don't think any one will see anything except in the first eight or tenrows of chairs, but it seems they will all hear. The stage was beingarranged, and, much to our amusement, they told us the Empire chairs andtables had been lent by the Abbe Marechal. He is a collectionneur, andhas some handsome furniture. We inspected our tea-room, which didn'tlook too bad. Our men were there with tables, china, etc., and when itis all arranged we shall have quite a respectable buffet. The landlordwas very anxious to decorate the tables with greens, flags, and perhapsa bust of Racine with a crown of laurels, but we told him it would bebetter not to complicate things.The view was lovely to-day from the top of the hill--the ruins lookingenormous, standing out against the bright blue sky, and soft and pink atthe top where the outline was irregular and the walls crumbling alittle. We had some difficulty in collecting our party, and finallydiscovered Francis, Ctesse de Gontaut and Christiani having chocolateand cakes in the back parlour of the grocer's shop (nothing likeequality on these occasions), who was telling them all the little gossipof the town, and naming the radicals who wouldn't go to the church.We had a pleasant evening with music and "baraque"--which is not veryfatiguing as a mental exercise. I tried to send all the party to bedearly, and have come upstairs myself, but I still hear the click of thebilliard balls, and sounds of merriment downstairs. It is a splendidstarlight night, the sky quite blue over the pines. I think we shallhave beautiful weather for our fete. I have very vague ideas as to howmany people we shall have for breakfast and dinner to-morrow, but the"office" is warned. I hope we shan't starve.April 24th. Monday.We had a beautiful and most successful day yesterday. All the householdwas stirring fairly early, as we had to get ourselves in to La Fertebefore 12 o'clock. We started in all sorts of conveyances--train,carriage, voiturette--and found the Grande Rue full of people. Theofficial breakfast was over, also the visit to the Mairie, where thereare a few souvenirs of the poet--his picture, acte de naissance,[12]and signature. The procession was just forming to climb up the steep,little street that leads to the church, so we took a short cut (stillsteeper), and waited outside the doors to see them arrive. It was apretty sight to see the cortege wind up the path--the Bishop ofSoissons and several other ecclesiastics in their robes, blackcoatedofficials, some uniforms--the whole escorted by groups of childrenrunning alongside, and a fair sprinkling of women in light dresses,with flowers on their hats, making patches of colour. The church wascrowded--one didn't remark the absence of certain "esprits forts" whogloried in remaining outside--and the service was most interesting.The lecture or rather "Eloge de Racine" was beautifully given by theAbbe Vignot. It was not very easy for a priest to pronounce from thepulpit an eulogium on the poet and dramatic author who had strayed sofar from the paths of grace and the early teachings of Port Royal,where the "petit Racine" had been looked upon as a model pupildestined to rise high in the ecclesiastical world; but the orator madeus see through the sombre tragedies of Phedre, Britannicus and othersthe fine nature of the poet, who understood so humanly the passionsthat tempt and warp the soul, and showed a spirit of tolerance veryremarkable in those days. He dwelt less upon the courtier; spoke moreof the Christian of his last days. He certainly lent to the "charm ofthe poet, the beauty of his voice," for it was impossible to hearanything more perfect than the intonation and diction of the speaker.[12] Birth certificate.There was a short address from Monseigneur Deramecourt, Bishop ofSoissons--a stately figure seated on the Episcopal throne in thechancel. The music was quite beautiful. We had the famous "Chanteurs deSt. Gervais," and part of the chaeurs d'Esther, composed by Moreau, andsung in splendid style by Mme. Jeanne Maunay, M. Vincent d'Indyaccompanying on the organ. The simple sixteenth century chaunts sung bythe St. Gervais choir sounded splendidly in the fine old cathedral. Thetones seemed fuller and richer than in their Paris church.We went out a little before the end to see what was going on on thegreen. It was still quite a climb from the church, and all the people ofthe upper town had turned out to see the sight. It is quite a distinctpopulation from the lower town. They are all canal hands, and mostly avery bad lot. The men generally drink--not enough to be reallyintoxicated (one rarely sees that in France), but enough to make themquarrelsome; and the women almost all slatternly and idle. They werestanding at their doors, babies in their arms, and troops of dirty,ragged, pretty little children playing on the road, and accompanying usto the green, begging for "un petit sou."We saw the cortege winding down again, the robes and banners of theclergy making a great effect, and we heard in the distance the strainsof the military band stationed on the Mail--echoes of the Marseillaiseand the "Pere la Victoire" making a curious contrast to the old-worldmusic we had just been listening to in the church. Our party scattereda little. Francis went down to the station with his auto to get theDuc and Duchesse d'Albufera, who had promised to come for the Comedieand dinner. They are neighbours, and have a beautiful place not veryfar off--Montgobert, in the heart of the Villers-Cotteret forest. Heis a descendant of Suchet, one of Napoleon's Marshals, and they have afine picture of the Marshal in uniform, and various souvenirs of theEmperor. Francis had some difficulty in making his way through theGrande Rue which was packed with people very unwilling to let anyvehicle pass. However, they had a certain curiosity about the littlecarriage, which is the first one to appear in this part of thecountry--where one sees only farmers' gigs on two high wheels, or atapissiere, a covered carriage for one horse. However, as every oneknew him they were good natured enough, and let him pass, but he couldnot get any further than the foot of the street--too steep for anycarriage to venture.It was a pretty sight as we got to the Place. Quantities of peoplewalking about--many evident strangers, seeing the ruins for the firsttime. There was a band of schoolboys, about twenty, with a priest, muchexcited. They wanted to go in the tent and get good places, but wereafraid of missing something outside, and were making little excursionsin every direction, evidently rather worrying their Director. The tent,fairly large, looked small under the shadow of the great walls. Welooked in and found a good many people already in their places, and sawthat the first two or three rows of red arm-chairs were being kept forthe quality. One of the sights was our two tall men standing at the doorof the rather dirty, dilapidated "Cafe des Ruines," piloting our friendspast the groups of workmen smoking and drinking in the porch, and up thedark, rickety staircase. I don't think any one would have had thecourage to go up, if Henrietta hadn't led the way--once up, the effectof our banqueting-hall was not bad. The servants had made it look verywell with china and silver brought from the house, also three or fourfresh pictures taken from the illustrated papers to cover those whichalready existed, and which looked rather the worse for smoke and damp.We were actually obliged to cover General Boulanger and his famousblack charger with a "Bois de Boulogne le Matin," with carriages,riders, bicycles, pretty women and children strolling about.The view from the windows was charming, and it was amusing to watch allthe people toiling up the path. We recognised many friends, and madefrantic signs to them to come and have tea. We had about three-quartersof an hour before the Comedie began, and when we got to the tent it wascrowded--all the dignitaries--Bishop, Prefet, Senator, Deputy (he didn'tobject to the theatrical performance), M. Henri Houssaye, Academician;M. Roujon, Directeur des Beaux Arts, sitting in the front row in theirred arm-chairs, and making quite as much of a show for the villagers asthe actors.The performance began with the third act of "Les Plaideurs," played withextraordinary entrain. There were roars of laughter all through thesalle, or tent--none more amused than the band of schoolboys, and theiryouthful enjoyment was quite contagious. People turned to look at them,and it was evident that, if they didn't see, they _heard_, as they nevermissed a point--probably knew it all by heart. Then came a recitation byMlle. Moreno, who looked and spoke like a tragic muse the remorse andsuffering of Phedre. The end of the performance--the two last acts ofBerenice--was enchanting. Mme. Bartet looked charming in her floatingblue draperies, and was the incarnation of the resigned, poetic, lovingwoman; Paul Mounet was a grand, sombre, passionate Titus, torn betweenhis love for the beautiful Queen and his duty as a Roman to choose onlyone of his own people to share his throne and honours. The Roman Senatewas an all-powerful body, and a woman's love too slight a thing tooppose to it. Bartet was charming all through, either in her longplaintes to her Confidante, where one felt that in spite of her repeatedassurances of her lover's tenderness there was always the doubt of theEmperor's faith or in her interviews with Titus--reproaching him andadoring him, with all the magic of her voice and smile. It was a triumphfor them both, and their splendid talent. With no decor, no room, noscenic illusions of any kind, they held their audience enthralled. Noone minded the heat, nor the crowd, nor the uncomfortable seats, and allwere sorry when the well-known lines, said by Mme. Bartet, in herbeautiful, clear, pathetic voice   "Servons tous trois d'exemple a l'Univers    De l'amour la plus tendre et la plus malheureuse    Dont il puisse garder l'histoire douloureuse,"brought to a close the fierce struggle between love and ambition.As soon as it was over, I went with Sebline to compliment the actors. Wefound Bartet, not in her dressing-room, but standing outside, still inher costume, very busy photographing Mounet, superb as a Roman Emperor.He was posing most impatiently, watching the sun slowly sinking behindthe ruins, as he wanted to photograph Berenice before the light failed,and the time was short. They were surrounded by an admiring crowd, thechildren much interested in the "beautiful lady with the stars all overher dress." We waited a few moments, and had a little talk with them.They said the fete had interested them very much and they were very gladto have come. They were rather taken aback at first when they saw thetent, the low small stage, and the very elementary scenery--were afraidthe want of space would bother them, but they soon felt that they heldtheir audience, and that their voices carried perfectly. They wererather hurried, as they were all taking the train back to Paris, exceptBartet, who had promised to stay for the banquet. I had half hoped shewould come to me, but of course I was obliged to waive my claim. When Isaw how much the Prefet and the official world held to having her--whenI heard afterwards that she had had the seat of honour next to theBishop I was very glad I hadn't insisted, as she certainly doesn't oftenhave the opportunity of sitting next to a Bishop. It seems he wasdelighted with her.We loitered about some little time, talking to all our friends. The viewfrom the terrace was beautiful--directly at our feet the little town,which is literally two streets forming a long cross, the Grande Rue astreak of light and color, filled with people moving about, and the airalive with laughter and music. Just beyond, the long stretches of greenpasture lands, cut every now and then by narrow lanes with apple treesand hawthorn in flower, and the canal winding along between the greenwalls of poplars--the whole hemmed in by the dark blue line of theVillers-Cotteret forest, which makes a grand sweep on the horizon.It was lovely driving back to Mareuil, toward the bright sunset clouds.We had a gay dinner and evening. I never dared ask where the various mendressed who came to dinner. The house is not very large, and every roomwas occupied--but as they all appeared most correctly attired, I supposethere are resources in the way of lingerie and fumoir which areavailable at such times, and Francis's valet de chambre is so accustomedto having more people than the house can hold that he probably took hisprecautions. Francis started off for the banquet at the Sauvage in hisvoiturette, but that long-suffering vehicle having made hundreds ofkilometres these last days, came to grief at the foot of "la Montagne deMarolles," and he was towed back by a friendly carter and arrived muchdisgusted when we were half through dinner.We heard all the details of the dinner from the Abbe Marechal. Certainlythe banqueting hall of the Sauvage will not soon again see such abrilliant assembly. Madame Bartet was the Queen of the Fete, and satbetween the Bishop and the Prefet. There were some pretty speeches fromM. Henri Houssaye, M. Roujon--and of course the toast of the Presidentaccompanied by the Marseillaise.The departure to the train was most amusing--all the swells, includingBartet, walking in the cortege, escorted by a torch-light procession,and surrounded by the entire population of La Ferte.The Grande Rue was illuminated from one end to the other, red Bengallights throwing out splendidly the grand old chateau and the towers ofNotre Dame.VIIIA CORNER OF NORMANDYBAGNOLES DE L'ORNE, July-August.It is lovely looking out of my window this morning, so green and cooland quiet. I had my petit dejeuner on my balcony, a big tree in thegarden making perfect shade and a wealth of green wood and meadow inevery direction, so resting to the eyes after the Paris asphalt. Itseems a very quiet little place. Scarcely anything passing--a bigomnibus going, I suppose, to the baths, and a butcher's cart. For thelast ten minutes I have been watching a nice-looking sunburned girl witha big straw hat tied down over her ears, who is vainly endeavouring toget her small donkey-cart, piled high with fruit and vegetables, up aslight incline to the gate of a villa just opposite. She has beenstruggling for some time, pulling, talking, and red with the exertion.One or two workmen have come to her assistance, but they can't doanything either. The donkey's mind is made up. There is an animatedconversation--I am too high up to hear what they say. Finally she leavesher cart, ties up her fruit in her apron, balances a basket of eggs withone hand on her head, and disappears into the garden behind the gate. Noone comes along and the cart is quite unmolested. I think I should havegone down myself if I had seen anyone making off with any of the fruit.It is a delightful change from the hot stuffy August Paris I leftyesterday. My street is absolutely deserted, every house closed exceptmine, the sun shining down hard on the white pavement, and perfectstillness all day. The evenings from seven till ten are indescribable--ahorror of musical concierges with accordions, a favorite Frenchinstrument. They all sit outside their doors with their families andfriends, playing and singing all the popular songs, and at intervals alljoining in a loud chorus of "Viens Poupoule." Grooms are teaching ladyfriends to ride bicycles, a lot of barking, yapping fox-terriers runningalongside. There is a lively cross-conversation going on from one sideof the street to the other, my own concierge and chauffeur contributinglargely. Of course my balcony is untenable, and I am obliged to sitinside, until happily sleep descends upon them. They all vanish, and thestreet relapses into perfect silence. I am delighted to find myself inthis quiet little Norman bathing-place, just getting known to theFrench and foreign public.It is hardly a village; the collection of villas, small houses, shops,and two enormous hotels surrounding the etablissement seems to havesprung up quite suddenly and casually in the midst of the green fieldsand woods, shut in on all sides almost by the Forest of Ardennes, whichmakes a beautiful curtain of verdure. There are villas dotted abouteverywhere, of every possible style; Norman chalets, white and gray,with the black crossbeams that one is so familiar with all over thispart of the country; English cottages with verandas and bow-windows;three or four rather pretentious looking buildings with high perrons andone or two terraces; gardens with no very pretty flowers, principallyred geraniums, some standing back in a nice little green wood, somedirectly on the road with benches along the fence so that theinhabitants can see the passers-by (and get all the dust of the roads).But there isn't much passing even in these days of automobiles. Thereare two trains from Paris, arriving at two in the afternoon and ateleven at night. The run down from Paris, especially after Dreux, ischarming, almost like driving through a park. The meadows arebeautifully green and the trees very fine--the whole country very likeEngland in appearance, recalling it all the time, particularly when wesaw pretty gray old farmhouses in the distance--and every now and then afine Norman steeple.There are two rival hotels and various small pensions and family houses.We are staying at the Grand, which is very comfortable. There is asplendid terrace overlooking the lake; rather an ambitious name for thebig pond, which does, however, add to the picturesqueness of the place,particularly at night, when all the lights are reflected in the water.The whole hotel adjourns there after dinner, and people walk up and downand listen to the music until ten o'clock. After that there is a decidedfalling off of the beau monde. Many people take their bath at half pastfive in the morning and are quite ready to go to bed early. The walkdown in the early morning is charming, through a broad, shadedalley--Allee de Dante. I wonder why it is called that. I don't supposethe poet ever took warm baths or douches in any description ofetablissement. I remember the tale we were always told when we werechildren, and rebelled against the perpetual cleansing and washing thatwent on in the nursery, of the Italian countess who said she would beashamed, if she couldn't do all her washing in a glass of water. It israther amusing to see all the types. I don't think there are manyforeigners. I hear very little English spoken, though they tell methere are some English here. We certainly don't look our best in theearly morning, but the women stand the test better than the men. Withbig hats, veils, and the long cloaks they wear now, they pass mustervery well and don't really look any worse than when they are attired fora spin in an open auto; but the men, with no waistcoats, a foulardaround their throats, and a very dejected air, don't have at all theconquering-hero appearance that one likes to see in the stronger sex.The etablissement is large and fairly good, but nothing like what onefinds in all the Austrian and German baths. When I first go in, comingout of the fresh morning air, I am rather oppressed with the smell ofhot air, damp clothing, and many people crowded into little hotbath-rooms. There are terrible little dark closets called cabinets derepos. Many doctors in white waistcoats and red ribbons are walkingabout; plenty of baigneuses, with their sleeves rolled up, showing a redarm that evidently has been constantly in the water; people who have hadtheir baths and are resting, wrapped up in blankets, stretched out onlong chairs near the windows; bells going all the time, cries of"Marie-Louise," "Jeanne," "Anne-Marie." It is rather a pandemonium. Ourbaigneuse, who is called Marie-Louise, is upstairs. At the top of thestairs there is a grand picture of the horse who discovered theBagnoles waters, a beautiful white beast standing in a spring, all waterlilies and sparkling water. A lovely young lady in a transparent greengarment with roses over each ear, like the head-dress one sees onJapanese women, is holding his bridle. The legend says that a certaingallant and amorous knight of yore, having become old and crippled withrheumatism, and unable any longer to make a brave show in tournamentsunder fair ladies' eyes, determined to retire from the world, and toleave his horse--faithful companion of many jousts--in a certain greenmeadow traversed by a babbling brook, where he could end his days inpeace. What was his surprise, some months later, to find his horsequietly standing again in his old stable, his legs firm and straight,his skin glossy, quite renovated. The master took himself off to themeadow, investigated the quality of the water, bathed himself, and beganlife anew with straightened limbs and quickened pulses. The waterscertainly do wonders. We see every day people who had arrived oncrutches or walking with canes quite discarding them after a course ofbaths.[Illustration: L'Etablissement, Bagnoles de l'Orme.]The hotel is full, mostly French, but there are of course someexceptions. We have a tall and stately royal princess with two daughtersand a niece. The girls are charming--simple, pretty, and evidently muchpleased to be away for a little while from court life and etiquette.They make their cure quite regularly, like any one else, walking andsitting in the Allee Dante. The people don't stare at them too much.There are one or two well-known men--deputies, membres del'Institut--but, of course, women are in the majority. There is aband--not very good, as the performers, some of them good enough alone,had never played together until they came here. However, it isn't ofmuch consequence, as no one listens. I make friends with them, as usual;something always draws me to artists. The boy at the piano looks sothin--really as if he did not get enough to eat. He plays very well,told me he was a premier prix of the Conservatoire de Madrid. When onethinks of the hours of work and fatigue that means, it is ratherpathetic to see him, contented to earn a few francs a night, poundingaway at a piano and generally ending with a "cake walk," danced by someenterprising young people with all sorts of remarkable steps andgestures, which would certainly astonish the original negro performerson a plantation.The view from the terrace at night is pretty--quantities of lightstwinkling about among the trees, and beyond, always on each side and infront, the thick green walls of the forest quite shutting in the quietlittle place. We are usually the last outside. It grows cooler as theevening gets on, and I fancy it is not wise to sit out too late afterthe hot bath and fatigue of the day.It is a splendid automobiling country, and every afternoon there is agoodly show of motors of all sizes and makes waiting to take theirowners on some of the many interesting excursions which abound in thisneighbourhood. We have an English friend who has brought over hisautomobile, a capital one--English make--and we have been out severaltimes with him. The other day we went to Domfront--a lovely road, almostall the way through woods, the forest of Audaine with its fine old treesmaking splendid shade. We passed through the Etoile--well known to allthe hunting men, as it is a favourite rendezvous de chasse. It is alovely part of the forest, a great green space with alleys running offinto the woods in all directions. Some of them, where the ground was alittle hilly, looked like beautiful green paths going straight up to theclouds.We kept in the forest almost all the way--as we got near Domfront theroad rising all the time, quite steep at the end, which, however, madeno perceptible difference in our speed. The big auto galloped up all thehills quite smoothly and with no effort. It was a divine view as wefinally emerged from the woods--miles of beautiful green meadows andhedges stretching away on each side and a blue line of hills in thedistance. We had been told that we could see Mont St. Michel and the seawith our glasses, but we didn't, though the day was very clear. Domfrontis a very old walled town, with round towers and a great square donjon,perched on the top of a mountain. A long stretch of solid wall is stillthere, and some of the old towers are converted into modern dwellings.It looked out of place to see ordinary lace curtains tied back with aribbon and pots of red geraniums in the high narrow windows, when onethought of the rough grim soldiers armed to the teeth who have stood forhours in those same windows watching anxiously for the first glimpse ofan armed band appearing at the edge of the meadows. The chateau musthave been a fine feudal fortress in its time and has sheltered manygreat personages. William the Conqueror, of course--he has apparentlylived in every chateau and sailed from every harbour in this part ofNormandy--Charles IX, Catherine de Medicis, and the Montgomery whokilled Henri II in tournament.[Illustration: In Domfront some of the old towers are converted intomodern dwellings.]It was too early to go home, so we went on to the Chateau de Lassay. Weraced through pretty little clean gray villages, looking peaceful andsleepy and deserted and evidently quite accustomed to automobiles. Noone took much notice of us. There were only a few old people andchildren in the streets; all the men were working in the fieldsgathering in their harvest. Lassay is quite a place, with hotels, shops,churches, and an old Benedictine convent. We left the auto in thesquare, as it couldn't get up the narrow, steep little road to thehotel. There were swarms of beggars of all ages--old women, girls,children--lining the road before we got to the chateau. Monsieur B.(deputy), who was with us, remonstrated vigorously, particularly withstout, sturdy young women who were pursuing us, but they didn't care abit, and we only got rid of them once we had crossed the moat anddrawbridge and got into the court-yard, where a wrinkled and red-cheekedold woman locked the door after us. The chateau is almost entirely inruins, but must have been splendid. There is a sort of moderndwelling-house in the inner court, but I fancy the proprietor rarelylives there. It is enormous. There are eight massive round towersconnected by a courtine (little green path) that runs along the top ofthe ramparts. The big door that opens on the park is modern, and makesdecidedly poor effect after the fine old pointed doorway that givesaccess to the great court-yard. The park, with a little care and alittle money spent on it, would be beautiful, but it is quite wild anduncared for. There are splendid old trees, some of them covered entirelywith ivy growing straight up into the branches and giving a mostpeculiar effect to the trees; ragged green paths leading to woods;running waters with little bridges thrown over them; a splendidvegetation everywhere, almost a jungle in some places--all utterlyneglected. The old woman took us through the "casemates"--dark stonegalleries with little narrow slits for windows or to fire through; theyused to run all around the house, connected by a subterranean passage,but they are now, like all the rest, half in ruins. It was mostinteresting. We had not the energy, any of us, to go up into the towerand see the view--we had seen it all the way, culminating at Domfronton the top of the mountain, and though very beautiful, it is always thesame--great stretches of green fields, hedges, and fine trees. It is alittle too peaceful and monotonous for my taste. I like something bolderand wilder. A high granite cliff standing out in the sea, with the greatAtlantic rollers breaking perpetually against it, appeals to me muchmore than green fields and cows standing placidly in little clearbrooks, and clean, comfortable farmhouses, with pretty gray Normansteeples rising out of the woods, but my companions were certainly notof my opinion and were enchanted with the Norman landscape. We had along ride back in the soft evening light. I am afraid to say how manykilometres we went in the three hours we were away.It has been warm these last days. There is a bit of road absolutelywithout shade of any kind we have to pass every time we go to theetablissement, which is very trying. I love the early morning walk,everything is so fresh and the air singularly light and pure. It seemswicked to go into that atmosphere of hot air and suffering humanity,which greets one on the threshold of the bathhouse. To-day I have beendriving with the princess. She does not like the automobile when she ismaking a cure--says it shakes her too much.We had a pretty drive, past the chateau of Couterne, which is mostpicturesque. A beautiful beech avenue leads up to the house, which isbuilt of brick, with round towers and a large pond or lake which comesright up to the walls. It is of the sixteenth century, and has beeninhabited ever since by the same family. One of the ancestors was"chevalier et poete" of Queen Marguerite of Navarre. I had a nice talkwith the princess about everything and everybody. I asked her if she hadever read "The Lightning Conductor." As her own auto is a Napier, Ithought it would interest her. I told her all the potins (little gossip)of the hotel--that people said her youngest daughter was going to marrythe King of Spain, and the general verdict was that the princess wouldmake "a beautiful queen." Every one is horror-struck at the murder ofthe Russian Minister of the Interior, and I suppose it is only abeginning.This afternoon I have been walking in the lovely woods at the back ofthe etablissement. It is rather a steep climb to get to the point de vueand troublesome walking, as the paths are dry and slippery and the rootsof the pine-trees that spread out over the paths catch one's heelssometimes. Some people spend all their day high up in the pines--take upbooks, seats, work, and gouter, and only come down after six, when theair gets cooler. We saw parties seated about in all directions and hadglimpses of the white dresses, which are a uniform this year, flittingthrough the trees. It was very pretty, but not like the walls ofMarienbad, with the splendid black pine forest all around and every nowand then a glimpse of a green Alm (high field on the top of a mountain),with the peasant girl in her high Tyrolean hat and clean whitechemisette standing on the edge, with her cows all behind her and thebells tinkling in the distance.[Illustration: Chateau de Lassay.]It was so warm this evening that we sat out until ten o'clock. We had avisit from Comte de G., son-in-law of our friend Mrs. L.S. He lives atDeauville, and had announced himself for Monday morning for breakfast attwelve. He _did_ come for breakfast, but on Tuesday morning, having beenen route since Monday morning at seven o'clock. He was in an automobileand everything happened to him that can happen to an automobile exceptan absolute smash. He punctured his tires, had a big hole in hisreservoir, his steering gear bent, his bougies always doing somethingthey oughtn't to. He dined and slept at Falaise; rather a sketchyrepast, but as he told us he could always get along with poached eggs,could eat six in an ordinary way and twelve in an emergency, we werereassured; for one can always get eggs and milk in Normandy. He arrivedin a perfectly good humour and made himself very pleasant. He is an oldsoldier--a cavalry officer--and doesn't mind roughing it.The journey from Deauville to Bagnoles is usually accomplished in threeor four hours. Falaise, the birthplace of William the Conqueror, is aninteresting old town, but looks as if it had been asleep ever since thatgreat event. The old castle is very fine, stands high, close to the edgeof the cliff, so that the rock seems to form part of the great walls.There is one fine round tower, and always the grass walk around theramparts.The views are beautiful. Looking down from one of the narrow, pointedwindows, still fairly preserved, we had the classic Norman landscape atour feet--beautiful green fields, enormous trees making spots of blackshade in the bright grass, the river, sparkling in the sunshine, windingthrough the meadows, a group of washerwomen, busy and chattering,beating their clothes on the flat stones where the river narrows alittle under the castle walls, and a bright blue sky overhead.We walked through the Grande Place--picturesque enough. On one side theChurch of La Trinite, and in the middle of the Place the bronzeequestrian statue of William the Conqueror. It is very spirited. He isin full armor, lance in hand, his horse plunging forward towardimaginary enemies. They say the figure was copied from Queen Mathilde'sfamous tapestries at Bayeux, but it looked more modern to me. I rememberall the men and beasts and ships of those tapestries looked mostextraordinary as to shape. Monsieur R. took over the young princessesthe other day in his auto. They were very keen to see the cradle oftheir race. It was curious to see the descendants of the great roughsoldier starting in an auto, fresh, pretty English girls, dressed in thetrotteuses (little short skirts) that we all wear in the country,carrying their Kodaks and sketching materials.All this part of the country teems with legends of the great warrior.Years ago, when we were at Deauville, we drove over to Dives tobreakfast--one gets a very good breakfast at the little hotel. Wewandered about afterward down to the sea (William the Conqueror is saidto have sailed from Dives), and into the little church where the namesof all the barons who accompanied him to England are written on tabletson the walls. We saw various relics and places associated with him andtalked naturally a great deal about the Conqueror. On the way home (wewere a large party in a brake) one of our compatriots, a nice youngfellow whose early education had evidently not been very comprehensive,turned to me, saying; "Do tell me, what did that fellow conquer?" Icould hardly believe my own ears, but unfortunately for him, just atthat moment we were walking up a steep hill and everybody in thecarriage overheard his remark. It was received with such shouts oflaughter that any explanation was difficult, and one may imagine thejokes, and the numerous and fabulous conquests that were instantly putdown to the great duke's account. The poor fellow was quite bewildered.However, I don't know if an American is bound to know any history butthat of his own country. I am quite sure that many people in thecarriage didn't know whom Pocahontas married, nor what part she playedin the early days of America. But it was funny all the same.We have been out again this afternoon in Monsieur R.'s auto--a charmingturn. We started out by the Etoile, as Monsieur R. wanted to show it tosome gentlemen who were with us. The drive, if anything, was more lovelythan the first time, the slanting rays of the sun were so beautifulshining through the rich green foliage, making patterns upon the hard,white road. We raced all over the country, through countless littlevillages, all exactly alike, sometimes flying past a stately old brickchateau just seen at the end of a long, beech avenue, sometimes past anold church standing high, its gray stone steeple showing well againstthe bright, cloudless sky, and a little graveyard stretching along thehillside, the roads bordered on each side with high green banks andhedges, the orchards full of apple-trees, and the whole activepopulation of the village in the fields. It is a beautiful month to bein Normandy, for one must have sun in these parts. As soon as it rainseverything is gray and cold and melancholy, the forest looks like agreat high black wall, the meadows are shrouded in mist, and the dampstrikes through one. Now it is smiling, sunny, peaceful.We have frightened various horses to-day; a quiet old gray steed, drivenby two old ladies in black bonnets. They were too old to get out, andwere driving their horse timidly and nervously into the ditch in theiranxiety to give us all the road. However, we slowed up and the horsedidn't look as if he could run away. Two big carthorses, too, at the endof a long line, dragging a heavy wagon, turned short round and almostran into us; also a very small donkey, driven by a little brown girl,showed symptoms of flight. I don't know the names of half the villageswe passed through. Near Bagnoles we came to La Ferte-Mace, which looksquite imposing as one comes down upon it from the top of a long hill.The church makes a great effect--looks almost like a cathedral. Bagnoleslooked very animated as we came back. People were loitering aboutshopping--quite a number of carriages and autos before the door of theGrand Hotel, and people sitting out under the trees in the gardens ofthe different villas. It was decidedly cool at the end of our outing; Iwas glad to have my coat.This morning after breakfast, in the big hall, where every onecongregates for coffee, we had a little political talk--not verysatisfactory. Everybody is discontented and everybody protests, but noone seems able to stop the radical current. The rupture with the Vaticanhas come at last, and I think might have been avoided if they had been alittle more patient in Rome. There will be all sorts of complicationsand bitter feeling, and I don't quite see what benefit the country atlarge will get from the present state of things. A general feeling ofirritation and uncertainty, higher taxes--for they must buildschool-houses and pay lay-teachers and country cures. A whole generationof children cannot be allowed to grow up without religious instructionof any kind. I can understand how the association of certain religiousorders (men) could be mischievous--harmful even--but I am quite surethat no one in his heart believes any harm of the women--soeurs decharite and teachers--who occupy themselves with the old people, thesick, and the children. In our little town they have sent away an oldsister who had taught and generally looked after three generations ofchildren. When she was expelled she had been fifty years in the town andwas teaching the grandchildren of her first scholars. Everybody knewher, everybody loved her; when any one was ill or in trouble she wasalways the first person sent for. Now there is at the school anintelligent, well-educated young laique with all the necessary brevets.I dare say she will teach the children very well, but her task ends withthe close of her class. She doesn't go to church, doesn't know thepeople, doesn't interest herself in all their little affairs, and willnever have the position and the influence the old religieuse had.I am sorry to go away from this quiet little green corner of Normandy,but we have taken the requisite number of baths. Every one rushes off assoon as the last bath (twenty-first generally) is taken. Countess F.took her twenty-first at six o'clock this morning, and left at ten.IXA NORMAN TOWNVALOGNES, August.I seem to have got into another world, almost another century, in thisold town. I had always promised the Florians I would come and staywith them, and was curious to see their installation in one of thefine old hotels of the place. The journey was rather long--notparticularly interesting. We passed near Caen, getting a very goodview of the two great abbayes[13] with their towers and spires quitesharply outlined against the clear blue sky. The train was full. Atalmost every station family parties got in--crowds of children allarmed with spades, pails, butterfly nets, and rackets, all theparaphernalia of happy, healthy childhood. For miles after Caen therewere long stretches of green pasture-lands--hundreds of cows andhorses, some of them the big Norman dray-horses resting a littlebefore beginning again their hard work, and quantities of long-leggedcolts trotting close up alongside of their mothers, none of themapparently minding the train. We finally arrived at the quiet littlestation of Valognes. Countess de Florian was waiting for me, withtheir big omnibus, and we had a short drive all through the town totheir hotel, which is quite at one end, a real country road running infront of their house. It is an old hotel standing back from the roadand shut in with high iron gates. There is a large court-yard with agrass-plot in the middle, enormous flower-beds on each side, and afine sweep of carriage road to the perron. A great double stonestaircase runs straight up to the top of the house, and glass doorsopposite the entrance lead into the garden. I had an impression ofgreat space and height and floods of light. I went straight into thegarden, where they gave me tea, which was most refreshing after thelong hot day. They have no house party. The dowager countess,Florian's mother, is here, and there was a cousin, a naval officer,who went off to Cherbourg directly after dinner. The ground-floor ischarming; on one side of the hall there are three or four salons, anda billiard-room running directly across the house from the garden tothe court-yard; on the other, a good dining-room and two or threeguests' rooms; the family all live upstairs.  [13] Abbaye aux Hommes, Abbaye aux Dames.It is a delightful house. My room is on the ground-floor, opening fromthe corridor, which is large and bright, paved with flagstones. Mywindows look out on the entrance court, so that I see all that goes on.As soon as my maid has opened the windows and brought in my petitdejeuner, I hear a tap at the door and the countess's maid appears toask, with madame's compliments, if I have all I want, if I have had agood night, and to bring me the morning paper. The first person to moveis the dowager countess, who goes to early mass every morning. She is atype of the old-fashioned French Faubourg St. Germain lady; a straight,slender figure, always dressed in black, devoted to her children and toall her own family, with the courteous, high-bred manner one alwaysfinds in French women of the old school. She doesn't take much interestin the outside world, nor in anything that goes on in other countries,but is too polite to show that when she talks to me, for instance, whohave knocked about so much. She doesn't understand the modern life, sosans gene and agitated, and it is funny to hear her say when talking ofpeople she doesn't quite approve of, "Ils ne sont pas de notre monde."[Illustration: Entrance to hotel of the Comte de Florian.]Then comes the young countess, very energetic and smiling, with hershort skirt and a bag on her arm, going to market. She sees me at thewindow and stops to know if I am going out. Will I join her at themarket? All the ladies of Valognes do their own marketing and some ofthe well-known fishwomen and farmers' wives who come in from thecountry with poultry would be quite hurt if Madame la Comtesse didn'tcome herself to give her orders and have a little talk. This morning Ihave been to market with Countess Florian. The women looked so niceand clean in their short, black, heavily plaited skirts, high whitecaps, and handkerchiefs pinned over their bodices. The little stallswent all down the narrow main street and spread out on the big squarebefore the church. The church is large, with a square tower and finedome--nothing very interesting as to architecture. Some of the stallswere very tempting and the smiling, red-cheeked old women, sitting upbehind their wares, were so civil and anxious to sell us something.The fish-market was most inviting--quantities of flat white turbots,shining silver mackerel, and fresh crevettes piled high on a marbleslab with water running over them. Four or five short-skirted,bare-legged fisher girls were standing at the door with baskets offish on their heads. Florian joined us there and seemed on the best ofterms with these young women. He made all kinds of jokes with them, towhich they responded with giggles and a funny little half-courtesy,half-nod. Both Florians spoke so nicely to all the market people as wepassed from stall to stall. The poultry looked very good--such fatducks and chickens. It was funny to see the bourgeoises of Valognesall armed with a large basket doing their marketing; they looked atthe chickens, poked them, lifted them so as to be sure of theirweight, and evidently knew to a centime what they had to pay. I fancythe Norman menagere is a pretty sharp customer and knows exactly whatshe must pay for everything. The vegetable stalls were very wellarranged--the most enormous cabbages I ever saw. I think the oldladies who presided there were doing a flourishing business. I did notfind much to buy--some gray knitted stockings that I thought would begood for my Mareuil[14] boys and some blue linen blouses with whiteembroidery, that all the carters wear, and which the Paris dressmakerstransform into very pretty summer costumes. I bought for myself apaper bag full of cherries for a few sous, then left the Florians, andwandered about the streets a little alone. They are generally narrow,badly paved, with grass growing in the very quiet ones. There are manylarge hotels standing well back, entre cour et jardin, the big doorsand gate-ways generally heavy and much ornamented--a great deal ofcarving on the facades and cornices, queer heads and beasts. Valogneshas not always been the quiet, dull, little provincial town it isto-day. It has had its brilliant moment, when all the hotels wereoccupied by grands seigneurs, handsome equipages rolled through thestreets, and its society prided itself on its exclusiveness and grandmanner. It used to be said that to rouler carrosse at Valognes was atitre de noblesse, and the inhabitants considered their town a "petitParis." In one of the plays of the time, a marquis, very fashionableand a well-known courtier, was made to say: "Il faut trois mois deValognes pour achever un homme de cour." One can quite imagine "lagrande vie d'autrefois" in the hotel of the Florians. Their garden isenchanting--quantities of flowers, roses particularly. They have madetwo great borders of tall pink rose-bushes, with dwarf palms fromBordighera planted between, just giving the note of stiffness whichone would expect to find in an old-fashioned garden. On one side is alarge terrace with marble steps and balustrade, and beyond that, halfhidden by a row of fruit-trees, a very good tennis court. We just seethe church-tower at one end of the garden; and it is so quiet onewould never dream there was a town near. The country in everydirection is beautiful--real English lanes, the roads low, high bankson each side, with hawthorn bushes on top--one drives between thickgreen walls. We have made some lovely excursions. They have a bigomnibus with a banquette on top which seats four people, also a placeby the coachman, and two great Norman posters, who go along at a goodsteady trot, taking a little gallop occasionally up and down thehills.  [14] Mareuil is the name of the village near our place in France.Countess de Nadaillac, Countess Florian's sister-in-law, arrived to-daywith her daughter for a short visit. We had a pleasant evening withmusic, billiards, and dominoes (a favorite game in this country). Thedowager countess always plays two games, and precisely at half-past nineher old man-servant appears and escorts her to her rooms. We all breakup early; the ten o'clock bell is usually the signal. It rings everynight, just as it has done for hundreds of years. The town lights areput out and the inhabitants understand that the authorities are notresponsible for anything that may happen in the streets of Valognesafter such a dangerous hour of the night.... There are some fine places in the neighborhood. We went to-day toChiffevast, a large chateau which had belonged to the Darus, but hasbeen bought recently by a rich couple, Valognes people, who have made alarge fortune in cheese and butter. It seems their great market isLondon.They send over quantities via Cherbourg, which is only twenty minutesoff by rail. It is a splendid place--with a fine approach by a greatavenue with beautiful old trees. The chateau is a large, squarehouse--looks imposing as one drives up. We didn't see the master of thehouse--he was away--but madame received us in all her best clothes. Shewas much better dressed than we were, evidently by one of the good Parishouses. Countess Florian had written to ask if we might come, so she wasunder arms. She was a little nervous at first, talked a great deal, veryfast, but when she got accustomed to us it went more easily, and sheshowed us the house with much pride. There was some good furniture andone beautiful coverlet of old lace and embroidery, which she had foundsomewhere upstairs in an old chest of drawers. They have nochildren--such a pity, as they are improving and beautifying the placeall the time. The drive home was delightful, facing the sunset. I wasamused with the Florians' old coachman. He is a curiosity--knowseverybody in the country. He was much interested in our visit and askedif we had seen "la patronne"--said he knew her well, had often seen heron a market day at Valognes, sitting in her little cart in the midst ofher cheeses and butter; said she was a brave femme. How strange it mustseem to people like that, just out of their hard-working peasantlife--and it _is_ hard work in France--to find themselves owners of asplendid chateau and estate, receiving the great people of the country.I dare say in ten or twelve years they will be like any one else, and ifthere were sons or daughters the young men would get into parliament orthe diplomatic career, the daughters would marry some impoverished scionof a noble family, and cheeses and butter would be forgotten.We had one delightful day at Cherbourg. The Prefet Maritime invited usto breakfast with him at his hotel. We went by rail to Cherbourg, abouthalf an hour, and found the admiral's carriage waiting for us. Theprefecture is a nice, old-fashioned house, in the centre of the town,with a big garden. We took off our coats in a large, handsome roomupstairs. The walls were covered with red damask and there were picturesof Queen Victoria and Louis Napoleon. It seems the Queen slept in thatroom one night when she came over to France to make her visit to LouisPhilippe at the Chateau d'Eu. We found quite a party assembled--all themen in uniform and the women generally in white. We breakfasted in alarge dining-room with glass doors opening into the garden, which wascharming, a blaze of bright summer flowers. We adjourned there forcoffee after breakfast. The trees were big, made a good shade, and thelittle groups, seated about in the various bosquets, looked pretty andgay. When coffee and liqueurs were finished we drove down to the quay,where the admiral's launch was waiting, and had a delightful afternoonsteaming about the harbour. It is enormous, long jetties and breakwatersstretching far out, almost closing it in. There was every description ofcraft--big Atlantic liners, yachts, fishing boats, ironclads, torpedoes,and once we very nearly ran over a curious dark object floating on thesurface of the water, which they told us was a submarine. It did notlook comfortable as a means of transportation, but the young officerstold us it was delightful.[Illustration: Market women. Valognes.]We got back to Valognes to a late dinner, having invited a large partyto come over for tennis and dinner the next day. The Florians are agodsend to Cherbourg. They are most hospitable, and with automobiles thedistance is nothing, and one is quite independent of trains. Yesterdayfour of our party went off to Cherbourg to make a cruise in atorpedo-boat. The ladies were warned that they must put on clothes whichwould not mind sea-water, but I should think bathing dresses would bethe only suitable garments for such an expedition. They were remarkableobjects when they came home, Mademoiselle de Nadaillac's hat acuriosity, also her white blouse, where the red of her hat-ribbons andcravat had run. However, they had enjoyed themselves immensely--at leastthe girl. Countess de Nadaillac was not quite so enthusiastic. They gotinto dry clothes and played tennis vigorously all the afternoon.We had a pleasant family evening. Mademoiselle de Nadaillac has a prettyvoice and sang well. Florian and I played some duets. I joined in thedowager's game of dominoes, which I don't seem to have mastered, as Ilose regularly, and after she left us, escorted by her faithful oldbutler (a light shawl over his arm to put on her shoulders when shepassed through the corridors), we had rather an interesting conversationabout ways and manners in different countries, particularly the wayyoung people are brought up. I said we were a large family and thatmother would never let us read in the drawing-room after dinner. If wewere all absorbed in our books, conversation was impossible. We were allmusical, so the piano and singing helped us through. Madame de Florian,whose father, Marquis de Nadaillac, is quite of the old school, saidthey were not even allowed to work or look at pictures in the _salon_after dinner! Her father considered it disrespectful if any of hischildren did anything but listen when he talked. They might join in theconversation if they had anything intelligent to say. She told us, too,of some of the quite old-fashioned chateaux that she stayed in as agirl, and even a young married woman. There was one fire and one lamp inthe drawing-room. Any one who wanted to be warm, or to work, was obligedto come into that room. No fires nor lamps allowed anywhere else in thehouse; a cup of tea in the afternoon an unheard-of luxury. If you wereill, a doctor was sent for and he ordered a tisane; if you were merelytired or cold, you waited until dinner-time.We have also made a charming expedition to Quineville, a small seasideplace about an hour and a half's drive, always through the same greencountry, our Norman posters galloping up all the hills. We passedthrough various little villages, each one with a pretty little gray,square-towered church. There was plenty of passing, as it was marketday. We met a good many peasant women carrying milk in those curious oldbrass bowls one sees everywhere here. Some of them are very handsome,polished until they shine like mirrors, with a delicate pattern lightlytraced running around the bowl. They balance them perfectly on theirheads and walk along at a good swinging pace. They all look prosperous,their skirts (generally black), shoes, and stockings in good condition,and their white caps and handkerchiefs as clean as possible. Quinevilleis a very quiet little place, no hotel, and rows of ugly little houseswell back from the sea, but there is a beautiful stretch of firm whitesand. To-day it was dead low tide. The sea looked miles away, a longline of dark sea-weed marking the water's edge. There were plenty ofpeople about; women and girls with stout bare legs, and a primitive sortof tool, half pitchfork, half shovel, were piling the sea-weed into thecarts which were waiting on the shore. Children were paddling about inthe numerous little pools and making themselves wreaths and necklacesout of the berries of the sea-weed--some of them quite bright-coloured,pink and yellow. We wandered about on the beach, sitting sometimes onthe side of a boat, and walking through the little pools and streams. Itwas a lonely bit of water. We didn't see a sail. The sea looked like agreat blue plain meeting the sky--nothing to break the monotony. We gotsome very bad coffee at the restaurant--didn't attempt tea. They wouldcertainly have _said_ they had it, and would have made it probably outof hay from the barn. The drive home was delicious, almost too cool, aswe went at a good pace, the horses knowing as well as we did that theend of their day was coming.... We have been again to market thismorning. It was much more amusing than the first time, as it was horseday, and men and beasts were congregated in the middle of the CathedralSquare. There was a fair show--splendid big carthorses and good cobs andponies--here and there a nice saddle-horse. There were a good many womendriving themselves, and almost all had good, stout little horses. Theyknow just as much about it as the men and were much interested in thesales. They told me the landlady of the hotel was the best judge of ahorse and a _man_ in Normandy. She was standing at the entrance of hercourt-yard as we passed the hotel on our way home, a comely, buxomfigure, dressed like all the rest in a short black skirt and sabots. Shewas exchanging smiling greetings and jokes with every one who passed andkeeping order with the crowds of farmers, drivers, and horse-dealers whowere jostling through the big open doors and clamoring for food forthemselves and their animals. She was the type of the hard-working,capable Frenchwoman of whom there are thousands in France.Some years ago I was on the committee for a great sale we had in ourarrondissement in Paris for the benefit of "L'Assistance par leTravail," an excellent work which we are all much interested in. I wasin charge of the buffet, and thought it better to apply at once to oneof the great caterers, Potel and Chabot, and see what they could do forus. We made an appointment, and Mme. de B. and I drove down to theplace. The manager was out, but they told us that Madame was waiting forus in the back shop. We found rather a pretty woman, very well dressedin velvet, with diamond earrings, and I was put out at first--thoughtthat didn't look like business. However, we talked a few minutes; shesaid her husband was obliged to go to the country, but would certainlycome and see me the next day. Then she stepped up to her desk, wherethere was a big book open, said she understood we wished to give anorder for a buffet for a charity sale, and was at once absorbed insandwiches, tea and coffee, orangeade, and all the requirements for suchan occasion. She was perfectly practical and gave us some very usefulhints--said she supposed we wanted some of their maitres d'hotel. Wethought not--our own would do. That, she said, would be a great mistake.They weren't accustomed to that sort of thing and wouldn't know how todo it. One thing, for instance--they would certainly fill all theglasses of orangeade and punch much too full and would waste a greatdeal. Their men never filled a glass entirely, and consequently gainedtwo on every dozen. She told us how much we wanted, made out theestimate at once, and ended by asking if we would allow them to presentthe tea as their contribution to the charity. It didn't take more thantwenty minutes--the whole thing. She then shut up her book, went to thedoor with us, thanked us for giving them the order, and hoped we wouldbe satisfied. That business capability and thriftiness runs throughalmost all Frenchwomen of a certain class, and when I hear, as of courseI often do, the frivolous, butterfly, pleasure-loving Frenchwoman spokenof, that energetic, hard-working bourgeoise comes into my mind. We allwho live in France know the type well.The whole nation is frugal. During the Franco-German War, my husband,who had spent all the dreary months of the invasion at his chateau inthe country, was elected a member of the Assemblee Nationale, which metat Bordeaux. They were entirely cut off from Paris, surrounded byPrussian troops on all sides, and he couldn't get any money. Whatever hehad had at the beginning of the war had been spent--sending off recruitsfor one of the great army corps near his place. It was impossible tocommunicate with his banker or any friends in Paris, and yet he couldn'tstart without funds. He applied to the notary of La Ferte-Milon, thelittle town nearest the chateau. He asked how much he wanted. W. saidabout 10,000 francs. The notary said, "Give me two days and I will getit for you." He appeared three days afterward, bringing the 10,000francs--a great deal of it in large silver five-franc pieces, verydifficult to carry. He had collected the whole sum from small farmersand peasants in the neighbourhood--the five-franc pieces coming alwaysfrom the peasants, sometimes fifty sewed up in a mattress or in thewoman's thick, wadded Sunday skirt. He said he could get as much more ifW. wanted it. It seems impossible for the peasant to part with his moneyor invest it. He must keep it well hidden, but in his possession.... We had a pretty drive this afternoon to one of Florian's farms, downa little green lane, some distance from the high-road and so hidden bythe big trees that we saw nothing until we got close to the gate. It waslate--all the cows coming home, the great Norman horses drinking at thetrough, two girls with bare legs and high caps calling all the fowl tosupper, and the farmer's wife, with a baby in her arms and anotherchild, almost a baby, pulling at her skirts, seated on a stone benchunderneath a big apple-tree, its branches heavy with fruit. She wassuperintending the work of the farm-yard and seeing that the two girlsdidn't waste a minute of their time, nor a grain of the seed with whichthey were feeding the chickens. A little clear, sparkling stream wasmeandering through the meadows, tall poplars on each side, and quiteat the end of the stretch of green fields there was the low blue line ofthe sea. The farmhouse is a large, old-fashioned building with one ortwo good rooms. It had evidently been a small manor house. One of therooms is charming, with handsome panels of dark carved wood. It seemed apity to leave them there, and almost a pity, that the Florians could nothave made their home in such a lovely green spot, but they would havebeen obliged to add to the house enormously, and it would havecomplicated their lives, being so far away from everything.[Illustration: Old gate-way. Valogues.]... We have had a last walk and flanerie this morning. We went to theHospice, formerly a Benedictine convent, where there is a fine gate-wayand court-yard with most extraordinary carving over the doors andgate--monstrous heads and beasts and emblems alongside of cherubs andbeautiful saints and angels. One wonders what ideas those old artistshad; it seems now such distorted imagination. We walked through some ofthe oldest streets and past what had been fine hotels, but they arequite uninhabited now. Sometimes a bric-a-brac shop on the ground-floor,and some sort of society on the upper story, but they are all neglectedand half tumbling down. There is still splendid carving on some of theold gate-ways and cornices, but bits of stone and plaster are fallingoff, grass is growing between the paving stones of the court-yards, andthere is an air of poverty and neglect which is a curious contrast tothe prosperous look of the country all around--all the little farms andvillages look so thriving. The people are smiling and well fed; theiranimals, too--horses, cows, donkeys--all in good condition.I have played my last game of dominoes in this fine old hotel and had mylast cup of tea in the stiff, stately garden, with the delicious saltsea-breeze always coming at four o'clock, and the cathedral chimessounding high and clear over our heads. I leave to-morrow night forLondon, via Cherbourg and Southampton.XNORMAN CHATEAUXWe never remained all summer at our place. August was a disagreeablemonth there--the woods were full of horse-flies which made ridingimpossible. No nets could keep them off the horses who were almostmaddened by the sting. They were so persistent that we had to take themoff with a sharp stick. They stuck like leeches. We generally went tothe sea--almost always to the Norman Coast--establishing ourselves in avilla--sometimes at Deauville, sometimes at Villers, and makingexcursions all over the country.Some of the old Norman chateaux are charming, particularly those whichhave remained just as they were before the Revolution, but, of course,there are not many of these. When the young ones succeed, there isalways a tendency to modify and change, and it is not easy to mix theelaborate luxurious furniture of our times with the stiff old-fashionedchairs and sofas one finds in the old French houses. Merely to look atthem one understands why our grandfathers and grandmothers always satupright.One of the most interesting of the Norman chateaux is "Abondant," in thedepartment of the Eure-et-Loir, belonging until very recently to theVallambrosa family. It belonged originally to la Duchesse de Tourzel,gouvernante des Enfants de France (children of Louis XVI and MarieAntoinette). After the imprisonment of the Royal Family, Madame deTourzel retired to her chateau d'Abondant and remained there all throughthe Revolution. The village people and peasants adored her and she livedthere peacefully through all those terrible days. Neither chateau norpark was damaged in any way, although she was known to be a devotedfriend and adherent of the unfortunate Royal Family. A band ofhalf-drunken "patriots" tried to force their way into the park one day,with the intention of cutting down the trees and pillaging the chateau,but all the villagers instantly assembled, armed with pitchforks, rustyold guns and stones, and dispersed the rabble.Abondant is a Louis XV chateau--very large--seventeen rooms enfacade--but simple in its architecture. The Duchess occupied a largecorner room on the ground-floor, with four windows. The ceiling (whichwas very high) and walls covered with toiles de Jouy. An enormous bed abaldaquin was trimmed with the same toile and each post had a greatbunch of white feathers on top.In 1886, when one of my friends was staying at Abondant, the hangingswere the same which had been there all through the Revolution. She toldme she had never been so miserable as the first time she stayed at thechateau during the lifetime of the late Duchesse de Vallambrosa. Theygave her the Duchesse de Tourzel's room, thinking it would interest heras a chambre historique. She was already nervous at sleeping alone onthe ground-floor, far from all the other inmates of the chateau. Theroom was enormous--walls nearly five metres high--the bed looked like anisland in the midst of space; there was very little furniture, and thewhite feathers on the bed-posts nodded and waved in the dim light. Shescarcely closed her eyes, could not reason with herself, and asked thenext morning to have something less magnificent and more modern.In all the bedrooms the dressing-tables were covered with dentelle deBinche[15] of the epoch, and all the mirrors and various little boxesfor powder, rouge, patches, and the hundred accessories for a finelady's toilette in those days, were in Vernis Martin absolutelyintact. The drawing-rooms still had their old silk hangings--a whiteground covered with wreaths of flowers and birds with wonderful brightplumage--hand-painted--framed in wood of two shades of light green.  [15] Binche, name of a village in Belgium where the lace is made.The big drawing-room was entirely panelled in wood of the same lightgreen, most beautifully and delicately carved. These old boiseries wereall removed when the chateau was sold. After the death of the Duchessede Tourzel the chateau went to her niece, the Duchesse des Cars--wholeft it to her niece, the Duchesse de Vallambrosa, a very rare instance,in France, of a property descending directly through several generationsin the female line.It was sold by the Vallambrosas. The old wood panels are in the Parishouse of a member of that family. The park was very large andbeautifully laid out, with the fine trees one sees all over Normandy.Twenty years ago a salle de spectacle "en verdure" still existed in thepark--the seats were all in grass; the coulisses (side scenes) made inthe trees of the park--their boughs cut and trained into shape, torepresent green walls, a marble group of allegorical figures at theback. It was most carefully preserved--the seats of the amphitheatrelooked like green velvet and the trees were always cut in the samecurious shapes. It seemed quite a fitting part of the fine old place,with its memories of past fetes and splendours, before the whirlwind ofliberty and equality swept over the country.Many of the chateaux are changing hands. The majorat (entail) doesn'texist in France, and as the fortunes must always be divided among thechildren, it becomes more and more difficult to keep up the largeplaces. Life gets dearer every day--fortunes don't increase--very fewyoung Frenchmen of the upper classes do anything. The only way ofkeeping up the big places is by making a rich marriage--the daughter ofa rich banker or industrial, or an American.       *       *       *       *       *Our cousins, Comte and Comtesse d'Y----, have a pretty little old placenot very far from Villers-sur-Mer, where we went sometimes forsea-bathing. The house is an ordinary square white stone building, afine terrace with a flight of steps leading down to the garden on oneside. The park is delightful--many splendid old trees. Until a few yearsago there were still some that dated since Louis XIV. The last one ofthat age--a fine oak, with wide spreading branches--died about two yearsago, but they cannot make up their minds to cut it down. I advised themto leave the trunk standing--(I think, by degrees, the branches willfall as they are quite dead)--cover it with ivy or a vine of some kind,and put a notice on it of the age of the tree.The house stands high, and they have splendid views--on one side, fromthe terrace, a great expanse of green valley looking toward Falaise--onthe other, the sea--a beautiful, blue summer sea, when we were there theother day.We went over from Villers to breakfast. It was late in the season, theend of September--one of those bright days one sometimes has inSeptember, when summer still lingers and the sun gives beautiful mellowtints to everything without being strong enough to make one feel theheat. The road was lovely all the way, particularly after we turned offthe high road at the top of the Houlgate Hill. We went through countlesslittle Norman lanes, quite narrow, sometimes--between high green bankswith a hedge on top, and the trees meeting over our heads--so narrowthat I wondered what would happen if we met another auto. We left thesea behind us, and plunged into the lovely green valley that runs alongback of the coast line. We came suddenly on the gates of the chateau,rather a sharp turn. There was a broad avenue with fine trees leading upto the house--on one side, meadows fenced off with white wooden palingswhere horses and cows were grazing--a pretty lawn before the house withbeds of begonias, and all along the front, high raised borders of redgeranium which looked very well against the grey stone.We found a family party, Comte and Comtesse d'Y----, their daughter anda governess. We went upstairs (a nice wooden staircase with broadshallow steps) to an end room, with a beautiful view over the park,where we got out of all the wraps, veils, and glasses that one must havein an open auto if one wishes to look respectable when one arrives, andwent down at once to the hall where the family was waiting.The dining-room was large and light, high, wide windows and beautifultrees wherever one looked. The decoration of the room was rathercurious. The d'Y----s descend--like many Norman families--from Williamthe Conqueror, and there are English coats-of-arms on some of theshields on the walls. A band which looks like fresco, but is reallypainted on linen--very cleverly arranged with some composition whichmakes it look like the wall--runs straight around the room with allsorts of curious figures: soldiers, horses, and boats, copied exactlyfrom the famous Bayeux tapestries, the most striking episodes--thedeparture of the Conqueror from Dives--the embarkation of his army (thecavalry--most extraordinary long queerly shaped horses with faces likepeople)--the death of Harold--the fighting Bishop Odo--brother of theConqueror, who couldn't carry a lance, but had a good stout stick whichapparently did good service as various Saxons were flying horizontallythrough the air as he and his steed advanced; one wonders at theimagination which could have produced such extraordinary figures, ascertainly no men or beasts, at any period of time, could have lookedlike those. The ships were less striking--had rather more the semblanceof boats.However, the effect, with all the bright colouring, is very good andquite in harmony with this part of the country, where everything teemswith legends and traditions of the great Duke. They see Falaise, wherehe was born, from their terrace, sometimes. We didn't, for though theday was beautiful, there was a slight haze which made the far-offlandscapes only a blue line.After breakfast we went for a walk in the park. They have arranged itvery well, with rustic bridges and seats wherever the view wasparticularly fine. We saw a nice, old, red brick house, near the farm,which was the manoir where the Dowager Countess lives now. She made overthe chateau to her son, in her life time, on condition that he wouldkeep it up and arrange it, which he has done very well. We made thetour of the park--passing a pretty lodge with roses and creepers allover it and "Mairie" put upon a sign; d'Y----is mayor of his littlevillage and finds it convenient to have the Mairie at his own gate. Werested a little in the drawing-room before going back, and he showed usvarious portraits and miniatures of his family which were mostinteresting. Some of the miniatures are exactly like one we have offather, of that period with the high stock and tight-buttoned coat. Thelight was lovely--so soft and warm--in the drawing-room, and as therewere no lace curtains or vitrages, and the silk curtains were drawn backfrom the high plate glass windows, we seemed to be sitting in the parkunder the trees. They gave us tea and the good little cakes, "St.Pierre," a sort of "sable," for which all the coast is famous.The drive home was enchanting, with a lovely view from the top of thehill; a beautiful blue sea at our feet and the turrets and pointed roofsof the Villers houses taking every possible colour from the sunsetclouds.We went back once more to a the dansant given for her seventeen-year-olddaughter. It was a lovely afternoon and the place looked charming--thegates open--carriages and autos arriving in every direction--people camefrom a great distance as with the autos no one hesitates to undertake adrive of a hundred kilometres. The young people danced in thedrawing-room--Madame d'Y---- had taken out all the furniture, and theparents and older people sat about on the terrace where there wereplenty of seats and little tea-tables. The dining-room--with an abundantbuffet--was always full; one arrives with a fine appetite after whirlingfor two or three hours through the keen salt air. The girls all lookedcharming--the white dresses, bright sashes, and big picture hats are sobecoming. They were dancing hard when we left, about half past six, andit was a pretty sight as we looked back from the gates--long lines ofsunlight wavering over the grass, figures in white flitting through thetrees, distant strains of music, and what was less agreeable, thestrident sound of a sirene on some of the autos. They are detestablethings.We were very comfortable at Villers in a nice, clean house looking onthe sea, with broad balconies at every story, where we put sofas andtables and green blinds, using them as extra salons. We were never inthe house except to eat and sleep. Nothing is more characteristic of theFrench (particularly in the bourgeoise) than the thorough way in whichthey _do_ their month at the sea-shore. They generally come for the monthof August. Holidays have begun and business, of all kinds, is slack.Our plage was really a curiosity. There is a splendid stretch of sandbeach--at low tide one can walk, by the shore, to Trouville or Houlgateon perfectly firm, dry sand. There are hundreds of cabins and tents,striped red and white, and umbrellas on the beach, and all day longwhole families sit there. They all bathe, and a curious fashion atVillers is that you put on your bathing dress in your own house--overthat a peignoir, generally of red and white striped cotton, and walkquite calmly through the streets to the etablissement. Some of theladies and gentlemen of mature year
